## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing a vinyl chloride polymer, particularly to improvement of scaling prevention on the inner wall surface of a polymerizer and so on in the course of polymerization of vinyl chloride, etc. In processes for suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer of a mixture of vinyl chloride monomer and other vinyl monomers in the presence of a polymerization catalyst, there is involved the problem that polymer scales stick to the inner wall surface of the polymerizer or the portions of the auxiliary equipment of the polymerizer which may come into contact with the monomer, such as stirrer, during polymerization Scales sticking to the inner wall of the polymerizer, etc. will result in a lower polymer yield and cooling capacity of the polymerizer, and may also cause so called fish eyes formed by the adhering scales peeling off the inner wall of the polymerizer and mixing in with the product, thereby lowering the quality of the product. Further, the removal of the adhering scales requires enormous amount of labor and time in addition, untreated monomers vinyl chloride, etc. are absorbed into the scales which may involve disadvantageously the danger of bringing about hazards to the human body. As the method for preventing scaling of polymer, it is known in the art to apply a coating of a chemical reagent hereinafter referred to as scaling preventive on the inner wall surface of the polymerizer various such scale preventives have been proposed. Among the various known methods, there is known a particularly good method in which a dye and or a pigment is used as the scaling preventive Japanese Patent Publication No. 30835 1970 . However, this method is not always effective and sure in preventing scaling, and thus is not always satisfactory. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for production of a vinyl chloride polymer which can surely prevent scaling in the course of polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer or a mixture of vinyl chloride monomer with other vinyl monomers. The present inventors in attempting to improve on the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 30835 1970 have consequently found that scaling can be prevented effectively and surely by use of a dye, or a pigment in combination with an inorganic compound, and also by controlling the chloride ions Cl in the reaction mixture during polymerization. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for production of a vinyl chloride polymer by suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer or a mixture of vinyl chloride monomer with a vinyl monomer copolymerizable with said vinyl chloride monomer in an aqueous medium, characterized in that the polymerization is carried out in a polymerizer, the inner wall surface and portions of the auxiliary equipment thereof which may come into contact with the monomer during polymerization being previously coated with a scaling preventive comprising at least one member selected from the group consisting of dyes and pigments and an inorganic compound, while controlling the chloride ion concentration in the reaction mixture to not higher than 100 ppm. According to the process of the present invention, the scaling preventing action possessed by the above scaling preventive can be induced surely and potently, whereby scaling can effectively be prevented. Accordingly, no labor or time is required for scale removal, enabling continuous use of the polymerizer and improved running efficiency. Also, the cooling capacity of the polymerizer can be maintained constantly, without any fear of entrainment of the scales into the product, whereby the quality of the product polymer can be improved. Generally, the chloride ion concentration in the reaction mixture during polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer or a vinyl monomer mixture containing vinyl chloride monomer will increase abruptly at the initial stage of polymerization, thereafter tending to be increased slightly or remain at the same level until completion of polymerization. The concentration of the chloride ions may be considered to be influenced by various factors such as the contents of methyl chloride and hydrochloric acid contained in the vinyl monomer used as the starting material, the temperature of the water used in charging, the degree of vacuum after charging, etc. The present inventors have found that the scaling preventing action possessed by dyes, and pigments can be surely induced by using them in combination with an inorganic compound and controlling said chloride ion concentration in the reaction mixture throughout the polymerization procedure to 20 ppm or less, to accomplish the present invention as mentioned above. If the chloride ion concentration in the reaction mixture during polymerization exceeds 20 ppm, even if the aforesaid scaling preventive may be applied on the inner wall surface of the polymerizer, etc., its effect as the scale preventive cannot fully be exhibited, whereby scaling cannot effectively be prevented. According to the present invention, one or more compounds selected from dyes and pigments may be used singly or in combination. However, it is preferable to use an azine dye.

Further, pigments may be exemplified by inorganic pigments such as Chrome Yellow, Zinc Yellow, ZTO type zinc chromate, red lead, iron oxide powder, zinc white, aluminum powder and zinc powder. In the process of the present invention, the scaling preventive to be used in the present invention further contains, in addition to at least one of dyes, and pigments, at least one of inorganic compounds. Although an inorganic compound per se has no scaling preventive action, the scaling preventive action possessed by dyes and pigments has unexpectedly been found to be enhanced when it is combined with dyes or the like. It has also been found that this effect can surely be exhibited, if the chloride ion concentration in the reaction mixture is controlled to 20 ppm or less. At a level of the chloride ion concentration in excess of 20 ppm, the scaling preventive effect is not enough to prevent effectively scaling. When a mixture of a dye and or a pigment with an inorganic compound is to be applied by coating on the inner wall surface of a polymerizer, etc., the proportion of the both components may preferably be 0.1 to 2000 parts by weight of the inorganic compound, more preferably 1 to 1000 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the dye, pigment or conjugated π bond compound. Such inorganic compounds may include silicic acids or silicates, such as orthosilicic acid, metasilicic acid, mesodisilicic acid, mesotrisilicic acid, mesotetrasilicic acid, sodium metasilicate, sodium orthosilicate, sodium disilicate, sodium tetrasilicate, potassium metasilicate, potassium hydrogen disilicate, lithium orthosilicate, hexalithium orthodisilicate, water glass, 12 silicotungstic acid, iso 12 silicotungstic acid, 10 silicotungstic acid, potassium 12 silicotungstate, potassium iso 12 silicotungstate, potassium 10 silicotungstate, sodium 12 silicotungstate, sodium iso 12 silicotungstate, silicomolybdic acid, potassium silicomolybdate and sodium silicomolybdate Among the above inorganic compounds, silicates, silicic acid colloid and ferric hydroxide colloid are particularly preferred. For coating of the scaling preventive on the inner wall of a polymerizer, it can be applied as such or as a coating solution prepared by dissolving or dispersing in an appropriate solvent. The concentration of the scaling preventive in the coating solution is generally preferred to be 0.01 by weight or higher. The solvent which may be used in preparation of the coating solution may be water or various organic solvents, including, for example When organic solvents highly compatible with water are employed, water may be added to the coating solution in an amount within the range which does not impair solubility or dispersibility of the scaling preventive, whereby the coating solution can be improved in economy and safety during transportation and storage. Such solvents includes When the scaling preventive to be used is a water soluble sulfonic acid type or carboxylic acid type dye having sulfonic acid groups or carboxylic acid groups in the form of an alkali salt or ammonium salt, water can be used as the solvent in which the preventive is to be dissolved, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5442 1981, whereby there is the advantage in safety and hygiene that the solvent is non toxic and harmless. If water is used as the solvent as described above, wettability of the coating solution for the inner wall of a polymerizer, can be enhanced by addition of alcohols, preferably C₃ ₆ monohydric alcohols, such as n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, iso butyl alcohol, sec butyl alcohol, t butyl alcohol, n amyl alcohol, t amyl alcohol, iso amyl alcohol, sec amyl alcohol, sec hexyl alcohol, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5444 1981. Also, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No 5442 1981, for the purpose of making drying of the coating solution after coating easier, an organic solvent compatible with water such as alcoholic solvents, ester solvents, ketone solvents, may be added to the coating solution. In carrying out coating of the coating solution containing the scaling preventive on the inner wall of a polymerizer, etc. according to the process of the present invention, various fixing agents can be used for enhancement of the fixing characteristic, if desired. The fixing agent may be used according to various methods, for example, the method in which it is incorporated in the coating solution containing the scaling preventive, the method in which the fixing agent or a solution thereof is previously applied on the wall surface prior to coating of the scaling preventive, followed by overlaying of the scaling preventive thereon, and the suitable method may be selected depending on the kind of the scaling preventive and the kind of the fixing agent. Such fixing agents may include the polymeric compounds as shown below In the process of the present invention, the above mentioned scaling preventive is applied on the inner wall surface of a polymerizer and the portions of the auxiliary polymerizer equipment where scales may be sticked, namely the portions which monomers may come into contact with during polymerization including portions which monomers can possibly contact , for example, stirring blades, stirring shaft, condenser, header, baffles, search coil, bolts, nuts, etc. Preferably, the scaling preventive is further applied on the portions of recovery system of unreacted monomers where scales may be sticked, for example, the inner surfaces of monomer distillation columns, condensers, monomer storage tanks, valves, etc. The materials of the above polymerizer and portions of the axuiliary polymerizer equipment are not particularly limited, but such a material as stainless steel or a material applied with glass lining may be available. These portions where coating is to be applied should preferably have a surface roughness Rmax as defined by JIS B 0106 of 10 µm or less, more preferably 5 µm or less. The method for applying the scaling preventive on the inner surface of a polymerizer, etc. as mentioned above is not particularly limited, and may be inclusive typically of the brush coating, spray coating, the method of filling the polymerizer with a coating solution followed by withdrawal thereof, and otherwise the automatic coating methods as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Publication Kokai Nos. 61001 1982, 36288 1980, Japanese Laid open Patent Publication Kohyo Nos. 501116 1981, 501117 1981 and Japanese Laid open Patent Publication Kokai No. 11303 1984. The process of the present invention is applicable for homopolymerization of vinyl chloride monomer and copolymerization of vinyl chloride monomer with other vinyl monomers in an aqueous medium. The system of polymerization may be either suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization.
