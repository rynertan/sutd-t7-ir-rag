# LONG CHAIN AMINE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
The invention relates to alkylated amine compounds of formula R₁ R₂ where R₁ is selected from alkyl groups containing an odd number of carbon atoms in the range 7 to 17 carbon atoms and where R₂ comprises an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment R₁ is a long chain alkyl group containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 70 , and R₂ is a methyl group. The alkylated amine compounds are conveniently prepared to a purity of at least 95 by reaction of an aldehyde R₁.CHO and an amine R₂.NH₂ in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example Raney nickel or rhodium catalysts.
