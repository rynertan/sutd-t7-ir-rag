# An arrangement for taking liquid samples.

## Abstract
An arrangement for taking liquid samples from a pipe 1 in which the liquid flows in a pulsating flow, comprising a by pass line 4 in the flow line, said by pass 4 leading from one section of the line having a larger flow pressure to a section having a lower pres sure, a chamber 7 with an outflow 8 for the sample to be tapped being provided in said by pass 4 .

## Claims
Claims 1. An arrangement for taking liquid samples from a pipe in which the liquid flows in a pulsating flow, comprising a by pass line in the flow line, said by pass leading from one section of the line having a larger flow pressure to a section having a lower pressure, a chamber with an outflow for the sample to be tapped being provided in said by pass. 2. An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein one section has a larger diameter, than the other. 3. An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said chamber is cup shaped. 4. An arrangement as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein in the outflow from said chamber a valve is provided. 5. An arrangement for taking liquid samples from a pipe in which the liquid flow is pulsated, substantially as hereinbefore described and illustrated in the accompanying drawing.

## Description
Hdt.An Arrangement for Taking Liquid SamplesThe present invention concerns an arrangement for taking liquid samples, in particular liquids which pass through a pipe at a pulsating flow.In pipe lines carrying milk, oil or the like which may or may not flow at uniform pulse rates, it is often desired to take samples of the flowing liquid for examination purposes. With liquids flowing continously a valvecontrolled tap in any part of the line is adapted to quickly provide such a sample. However, when the liquid in the pipe line flows in a pulsating flow, the withdrawal of the samples thereof is complicated, since when samples are to be taken it may happen that at that particular moment there is no liquid flowing.It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an arrangement for taking liquid samples from a pipe line in which the liquid passes therethrough in a pulsating flow.The invention consists in an arrangement for taking liquid samples from a pipe in which the liquid flows in a pulsating flow, comprising a by pass line in the flow line, said by pass leading from one section of the linehaving a larger flow pressure to a section having a lower pressure, a chamber with an outflow for the sample to be tapped being provided in said by pass.In a preferred embodiment of the invention said chamber is cup shaped.The invention is illustrated, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawing showing schematically an arrangement for taking liquid samples of a liquid flow in a pulsating flow through a pipe.A pipe line 1, in which there is a pulsated liquid flow, is provided with a reduced section 2 so that a pressure differential is obtained across position 3. A by pass line 4 is connected with its inflow tube 5 to line 1 and its outflow tube 6 to section 2, its central portion being enlarged at 7 constituting a chamber which is preferably in theshape of a depending cup, but may be of anysuitable shape. The outflow 8 from cup 7 leads downwards and is provieded with a valve 9, the bottom of outflow 8 being provided with means to attach a sample bottle 10 or the like. It can be seen that whenever liquid flows through pipe line 1 it will likewise flow through by pass 4 and accumulate in cup 7 to be tapped therefrom via outflow 8 and valve 9. Any excess liquid will flow through outflow 6 and return to pipe 2.It can be seen that there will always be a quantity of liquid in cup 7 when valve 9 is cloeed even though at the particular moment when the sample is to be taken no liquid flows through pipe 1.Instead of reducing the diameter of line 1 at position 3, it is possible to achieve pressure differential in any other suitable manner, as known per se.
