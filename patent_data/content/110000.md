## Abstract
A screw spindle 7 that moves a load lifting member 8, 10 is actuated through a geaning 4, 5, 6 operated by a motor reducer assembly 2 .

## Claims
Claims. 1 Vehicle hoist fran the ground, characterized by the fact that foresees to integrally fit the above hoist on the frame with a motor group, the shaft of which is in an engaged condition in the opeation one of the conventional kinematic devices of the means. 2 Vehicle hoist fran the ground, according to the previous claim, characterized by the fact that in a version, motor reducer assembly 2 is foreseen integrally fitted on frame 1 on flange 3. The motor group shaft engages gears 4 and 5 having the corresponding one in 6. The wheel and pin movement lets vertical screw 7 rotate whick makes chariot 8 move inThe longitudinal seat 9 having a square section, bringing engaging part 10 upwards or downwards. 3 Vehicle hoist from the ground , according to the previous claims,characterized by the fact that for the employ the driver lays the hoist with its base 11 on the ground, taking care to introduce part 10 into the correspnding engaging seat of the vehicle. By electrical control he then lifts the wheel and intervences on it. At end of the interven tion on the said wheel, he electrically controls the inverted rotation sense bringing the wheel again on the ground.

## Description
Vehicle hoist trom the ground.The invention refers to a hoist for vehicles from the ground with automatic operation which substantially enables the distressed vehicle driver at first to lift the wheel to proceed to its replacement and then again on the ground, without manual intervention.The heavy discomfort is well known due to the necessity of the manual employ of the lifting means which at present compels the operator to bend and in general with knees on the ground, to enable the required power for the crank operations. Substantially the automatic hoist, according to the invention, foresees to integrally fit the above hoist on the frame with a motor group,the shaft of which is in an engaged condition in the operation one of the convenional kinematic devices of the means.An execution form is shown in a merely indicative way and, therefore, not limiting the procedure, in the drawings of Table 1, where fig. 1 is the longitudinal section of the hoist exibiting the motor reducer group fitted by the flange on the frame box containing wheel and pin and with the rotation shaft in condition of movement trasmission. Fig. 2 is the perspective view, partially cut, of the same to show the kinematic devices.In a version, motor reducer assembly 2 is foreseen integrally fitted on frame 1 on flange 3. The motor group shaft engages gears 4 and 5 having the corresponding one in 6. The wheel and pin movement lets vertical screw 7 rotate which makes chariot 8 move in the longitudinal seat 9 having a square section, bringing engaging part 10 upwards or downwards. For the employ, the driver lays the hoist with its base 11 on the ground taking care to introduce part 10 into the corresponding engaging seat of the vehicle. By electrical control he then lofts the wheel and intervenes on it. At end of the intervention on the said wheel, he electri cally controls the inverted rotation sense bringing the wheel again the ground.Practically the execution particulars, the hoist form, the type of the motor assembly, the materials and anything else in this connection may be otherwise differently employed.
