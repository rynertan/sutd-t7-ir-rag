# MONOMER COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING DICYCLOPENTENYLOXYALKYL ESTER AND DRYING OIL ESTER AND COATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
Monomer compositions comprise a from 1 to 99 by weight of monomer of at least one dicyclopentenyloxyalkyl ester of polymerizable ethy lenically unsaturated monocarboxylic or dicarboxylic acid, and b from 1 to 99 by weight of monomer of at least one drying oil or semi drying oil ester having ethyle nically unsaturated addition polymerisable functionality in the ester moiety. The compositions may be used as reactive diluents in coating and or impregnating compositions comprising 1 from 5 to 75 by weight of the monomer composition 2 from 95 to 25 by weight, based on the weight of components 1 and 2 , of a film forming component comprising at least one of drying oil alkyd resins having autoxidative functionality vinyl addition polymers with drying oil functionality film forming binders lacking any appreciable inherent autoxidizable functionality and condensation polymers modified with acrylate or meth acrylate functionality 3 a polyvalent metal containing complex or salt that catalyzes the autoxidative curing of components 1 and 2 , and, optionally, 4 a volatile oxime stabilizer.
