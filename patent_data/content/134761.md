# Machine for positioning fixing elements on prior laid tracks.

## Abstract
The invention belongs to the technical field of equip ment designed to perform, in an automated fashion, track laying and or maintenance operations and relates, in particu lar, to a machine for positioning on prior laid rails, fixing elements such as track bolts 32, clips 36, spring washers 43 and nuts 47 in order to lock the said rails 118 to plates 114 already integral with supporting sleepers 115. The machine in question comprises, among other items, guide means 2 10 15 for directing each type of the said elements along at least one specific routing path that commences at a charging area, passes across a vibrator 16 designed to place the said elements in predetermined positions, and terminates at a rotary table 18 designed to accept each type of the said elements and provided with assembly stations and means 53 for expelling pre assembled sets 55 of the said elements towards magazines 60 able to house, placed in alignment therein, a plurality of the said pre assembled sets. The general structure of the positioning machine is envisaged as being in the form of a car 1 movable on rails and, among other things, carrying a store 73 able to contain a plurality of the said magazines 60, and means 85 for supplying the said pre assembled sets 55 from the said store to laying equipment 94 designed to insert the said pre assembled sets slotted into the said plates, the said laying equipment being connected to support means 95 that cause the said equipment to undergo inching motion even when the said car is constantly moving.
