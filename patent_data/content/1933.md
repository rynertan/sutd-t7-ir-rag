# VIDEO A TRACE DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR ULTRASONIC DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
A video A trace display system for ultrasonic diagnostic equipment provides means 250 for writing pulse reflection data into a memory 111 , and means 226 for selectively accessing the memory 111 to place the data on a video screen in graphic form. The data is stored and accessed in a format which is compatible with the scan pattern associated with the video display. One each video line, the accessed data is compared with a value corresponding to the ordinate value of the line to control the intensity of the beam in scanning the line.
