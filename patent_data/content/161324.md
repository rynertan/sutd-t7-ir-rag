# Quantum counting Radiography method and Apparatus.

## Abstract
A quantum counting radiography apparatus compris ing an X ray source 23 emitting through a slit diaphragm 22 a fan shaped radiation beam which, after passing through the body of a patient 3 , is received by an array of semiconductor detectors 5 . The semiconductor detectors 5 are of reduced thick ness with electrodes 6, 10 on both sides, and are connect ed, via high speed amplifiers 7, 17 , to a pulse counting equipment 18 .
