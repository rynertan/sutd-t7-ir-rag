# Method of terminating flat multi conductor electrical cable and connector therefor.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 10 for terminating flat elec trical cable 18 of the type having at least one ground conductor 20 between adjacent signal conductors 22 , all the conductors being secured in fixed, parallel, closely spaced relationship within an insulating web, includes a cover member 12 having a cable engaging face defined by a plurality of conductor receiving passages 30, 32 , alternate ones 30 of the passages 30, 32 being adapted to receive the signal conductors 22 and the ground con ductors 20 respectively, with the ground conductor pas sages 30 having greater depth than the signal conductor passages 32 , whereby conductors 20, 22 seated in the passages 30, 32 can be terminated by applying a housing 14 to the cover member 12 with terminals 56 and a bus bar 70 carried by the housing 14 effecting termi nation of the signal and ground conductors respectively.
