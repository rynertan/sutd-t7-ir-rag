# Device and method for making and collecting fine alloy powder.

## Abstract
Fine powder of an alloy of two or more metals is made by vaporizing each of these metals in its own vaporization chamber 5, 5 , mixing each of the metallic vapors with an inert carrier gas, and then adiabatically expanding each of the mixture gases through its own nozzle 13, 13 , which preferably is a convergent divergent nozzle. Jet flows 14, 14 from the nozzles are collided together, after having been very rapidly cooled by this adiabatic expansion, and thereby the metal vapors in the jet flows are quickly con densed into very fine alloy particles. Optionally the combined flows from the jets are directed against an alloy powder collecting means, which may be a collection plate 15 , but preferably is a bath of oil which entrains the alloy particles and keeps them from agglomerating together by partially neutralizing their surface activity. Thus fine alloy powder with particle diameters of the order of a few hundreds of angstroms can be economically produced.
