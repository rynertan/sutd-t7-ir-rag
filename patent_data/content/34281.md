The formula I salts of the symmetrical trisubstituted N nitroaniline compounds can be conventiently prepared from the trisubstituted nitroaniline compounds by one or more procedures, hereinafter referred to as MethodsA,B,C,D or E.Methods for the preparation of salts of 2,4,6 trisubstituted N nitroanilinesMethod A The N nitroaniline is dissolved in dilute aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide and filtered. To this solution is added one molar equivalent of the appropriate amine salt and dissolved in water. In most cases the product separates as a solid, and is removed by filtration and purified by recrystallization. Whenever no precipitation occurs or the product separates as an oil, an extraction with methylene chloride is performed. Concentration of this extract yields the product which may be further purified by recrystallization.Method B A solution of the N nitroaniline in anhydrous ether is treated with a solution of one equivalent of the appropriate nitrogen base in ether. The desired product is removed by filtration and purified by washing and recrystallization. Precipitation of the product may be promoted by the addition of petroleum ether.Method C To a methanolic suspension of the silver salt of the N nitroamine is added one equivalent of the halide salt of the appropriate amine dissolved in methanol. The mixture is stirred at 250C for one hour. The precipitated silver halide is removed by filtration, the product recovered by evaporating the methanolic solution and purified by recrystallization.Method D An aqueous solution of the sodium salt of the Nnitroaniline is saturated with a large excess of the desired metal salt until solids remain undissolved. After stirring for one hour, the solids are removed by filtration and recrystallized or washed with a suitable solvent, and dried.Method E A methylene chloride solution of the free N nitroaniline is treated with a three fold excess of an aqueous solution of the appropriate metal hydroxide, acetate or carbonate. If precipitation occurs, the product is removed by filtration and recrystallized. Otherwise, the aqueous layer is separated and evaporated to dryness. The residue is treated with ethyl acetate and filtered. Removal of the ethyl acetate affords the product which may be recrystallized, if necessary. Surprisingly, it has also been found that the formula I compounds of this invention are effective for reducing the relative stem growth of broadleaf plants and for increasing the stem stiffness thereof, particularly for broadleaf agronomic crops such as sunflowers, when said compounds are applied preemergence to soil in which seeds of said plants have been sown. When used in this manner said formula I compounds are generally applied at rates of from 0.25 to 0.75 kg ha. The invention is further illustrated by the Examples set forth below.

The solution also contains 0.25 v v colloidal BIOFILM a product of Colloidal ProductsCorp. which is a mixture of alkyl aryl polyethoxyethanol, free and combined fatty acids, glycol ethers, dialkylbenzene carboxylate and 2 Propanol. The plant species used in these tests are barley Hordeum vulgare , Mexico and soybean Glycine max Adelphia. The solution or dispersion of the compound under test is sprayed at a rate of 747 l ha with a moving nozzle along an overhead stationary track. The spray.nozzle moves at a constant speed over the plants. The plants are grown in plastic pots, and are well established at the time of treatment. The seedlings of barley are 10 to 20 cm in height, while the seedlings of soybeans are at the second to third trifoliate stage. Plants are watered prior to treatment and then sprayed to provide the kg ha rate of test compound desired. After spraying the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and watered and fertilized in accordance with normal greenhouse procedures. Three weeks after spraying the plants are measured and harvested. Harvesting is done at the boot stage. All treatments are replicated six times and comparisons are made against untreated controls. Data obtained are reported inTables II and III below as percent reduction in plant height over untreated controls.

Three weeks after treatment the plants are examined to determine what effect the application of test compound has had on the axillary branching and canopy development of the treated plants. Increased axillary branching and improved canopy are biological responses which are highly advantageous in the growing of ornamental plants. These responses also have advantage in many crops since increased branching may result in the greater production of fruit, while improved canopy tends to shade and suppress the growth of undesirable weeds that compete with the crops for sunlight, water and plant nutrients. Data obtained are reported in Table IV below where axillary branching and canopy are reported as percent increase over untreated controls.

Test solutions or dispersions are prepared with 0.25 v v Colloidal BIOFILM surfectant and sufficient test compound to provide the plants with 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 or 0.06 kg ha of said compound when the test solutions are sprayed on said plants from an overhead sprayer delivering 747 l ha of solution. After spraying the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and watered and fertilized. Three weeks after spraying the plants are examined and the amount of flowering determined for all plants. Data obtained are reported in the table below as percent increase in flowering over untreated controls. From the data reported in Table V below it can be seen that the compounds of the present invention applied at rates of from 0.06 to 0.25 kg ha enhance flowering of treated plant more than 10 over untreated controls. This response is particularly desirable for treatment of flowering varieties of ornamental plants as well as agronomic crops.

Stoneville are grown in 20 X 15 cm fibre pots to the 6th to 7th true leaf stage.They are then sprayed with test solutions or dispersions prepared in water acetone mixtures containing 1 0.25 v v of colloidal BIOFILM surfactant which is a mixture of alkyl aryl polyethoxyethanol, free and combined fatty acids, glycol ethers, dialkylbenzene carboxylate and 2 propanolt and 2 sufficient test compound. to provide 1.5, 0.75 or 0.25 kg ha thereof when applied to said plants from an overhead sprayer designed to deliver 747 l ha with a moving nozzle over a stationary track. The spray nozzle moves at a constant speed over the test species. After spraying the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and watered and fertilized in accordance with conventional greenhouse practices. Periodically, the plants are examined, measured, and the number of flower, buds and bolls determined for each plant. Data obtained are reported in Table VI below as percent increase in flowers, buds and bolls over untreated controls.
