# HOLLOW MULTILAYER PRINTED WIRING BOARD, AND METHOD OF FABRICATING SAME.

## Abstract
The hollow multliayer printed wiring board is composed of plural print boards 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 laminated with a pre determined spacing therebetween, each of which has a signal conducting pattern 6 formed on at least one surface thereof and a land conducting pattern 7 formed on at least one surface thereof. The board has through holes 10 which are plated to connect with the land conducting pattern and each of the through holes and a plated through hole in at least one board of the boards adjacent thereto are positioned on a straight line so as to provide a plated through hole or an interstitial wire hole 12 , 13 . Formed on at least the upper and lower end surfaces of each through hole 10 are low melting point metal layers which function as conductors among the signalconducting patterns in 2 or more of the plural boards and as layer bonding materials for the plural boards. The laminated boards, except at least one of the boards on the outer sides, is made of a heat proof organic plastics sheet or an insulated metal.
