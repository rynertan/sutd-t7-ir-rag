# Electric discharge tube.

## Abstract
Flat and slightly convex pyrolytic graphite grid elec trodes are very suitable for use in electric discharge tubes, for example in ion sources, cathode ray tubes, travelling waveguides and transmitter tubes. It has proved possible to manufacture said electrodes by manufacturing the grid and the grid holder of the pyrolytic graphite electrode from one piece of pyrolytic graphite. Such integral grid electrodes have a very good mechanical and thermal behaviour.
