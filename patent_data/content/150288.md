## Description
HOLLOW MICROSPHERES WITH WALL THROUGH OPENINGS The present invention is directed to hollow microspheres, and to methods for manufacture thereof.Background of the Invention Hollow micro sized shells, also known as microspheres or microballoons, are finding ever increasing utility in the arts. One recent application of microsphere technology is in the field anchorage dependent cell cultivation wherein glass surfaced microspheres are employed as cell microcarriers. United States patent application SerialNos. 332,377 and 354,345 respectively filed December 21, 1981 and March 3, 1982, both assigned to the assignee hereof, provide microspheres having spherically continuous glass surfaces for cell attachment and having densities tailored closely to match that of the culture medium.The latter feature presents a highly desirable improvement by permitting the microcarriers to remain suspended in the culture medium with minimal agitation. The technology disclosed in these applications has been successfully implemented, but is more expensive than desired for high volume commercial applications. One important aspect of the present invention contemplates provision of hollow microspheres for microcarrier applications which embody the desirable features of glass for cell attachment, which are readily suspendable in a cell culture medium with little or no agitation, and which are more economical to implement than technology heretofore proposed. Another application of microsphere technology which is enjoying increased interest is in the field of thermal insulation. United States Patent No. 4,303,732, for example, discloses a thermal barrier wherein microspheres are employed as a filler. The microspheres are of glass construction, and may be made to enclose a high vacuum and a thin metal coating deposited on the inner surface of the shell wall. Manufacture is accomplished by using a blowing gas of metallic vapor to expand a molten glass film, which gas thereafter condenses on the shell wall as the shell cools, leaving a high vacuum encapsulated within the shell. In addition to being somewhat expensive to implement, disposition of the heat reflective coating on the shell wall inside surface permits the shell itself to be heated.A second important aspect of the present invention contemplates provision of an improved method for manufacturing microspheres for thermal insulation applications, and to the resulting product, wherein the shell interior is evacuated and the heat reflective metallic coating is disposed on the outer shell surface.Objects and Summary of the Invention In addition to the foregoing, another important object of the invention is to provide an improved method for manufacturing hollow microspheres, including allglass microspheres, having an evacuated interior. In accordance with the present invention, hollow spherical shells or microspheres having wall throughopenings are provided by first fabricating shells having spherically continuous i.e. closed walls in which discrete wall zones having physical and or chemical properties rendering them susceptible to removal are carried in a matrix formed by the remainder of the wall having different physical and or chemical properties.The shells are then treated selectively to remove the susceptible zones while leaving the surrounding matrix intact. The resulting openings extend through the shell wall from interior to exterior. In one implementation of the invention, starter shells are of silicate glass com position which is either phase separated in the manufactur ing process or in a subsequent heat treating operation to form silica deficient zones surrounded by a silica rich matrix. The silica deficient zones are removed in a leaching operation, leaving a silica rich shell having wall through openings.In microcarrier applications for cell cultivation, the wall through openings permit the culture medium to enter the shell interior, so that the shell itself exhibits substantially neutral buoyancy neither floats nor sinks , and thus remains suspended for substantial periods of time with minimal agitation. In another implementation of the invention, starter shells of polymeric construction are selectively irradiated to create damage tracks within the otherwise cross linked wall microstructure. These damaged zones are removed to leave a polymeric shell having through the wall openings. For insulation applications, the hollow glass or polymeric shells may be vacuum coated to obtain a discrete surface layer of reflective metallic construction and an evacuated interior sealed by the surface layer. Alternatively, the glass shells may first be subjected to a vacuum sintering operation to close the wall through openings and thereby seal the evacuated shell interior. The closed and evacuated shell may then be coated to obtain the exterior metallic layer. Brief Description of the Drawings The invention, together with additional objects, features and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a process flow chart for manufacturing glass shells having wall through openings in accordance with one aspect of the invention FIG. 2 is a corresponding flow chart for manufacture of polymeric shells FIGS. 3 4 are SEM micrographs at 10,000X magnification which illustrate phase separation of glass shells FIGS. 5 9 are SEM micrographs which illustrate the wall through openings in various glass shells in accordance with the invention, FIG. 5 being at 5000X magnification and FIGS. 6 9 being at 10,000X magnification and FIG. 10 is a process flow chart for obtaining coated evacuated shells in accordance with the invention. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments FIG. 1 is a process flow chart for obtaining silicate glass shells with through the wall openings in accordance with the invention. There are many techniques for fabrication of glass microspheres known in the art. The physical state of the starting material depends upon the technique employed, and may comprise a dried and crushed metal organic gel, a liquid metal organic gel, glass frit, or an aqueous collodial suspension or sol. Likewise, the manner of shell fabrication depends upon the starting material employed, and may include dropping gel or frit particles through a tower furnace, spray atomization of a liquid gel or sol into a furnace, or flame spraying of gel or frit particles. Standard techniques for glass microsphere fabrication are variously illustrated, for example, in United States Patent Nos. 3,365,315, 4,017,290, 4,021,253, 4,336,338 and 4,340,407. Thus, in general,Steps 1 and 2 in FIG. 1 are conventional, and result in an intermediate shell product having a spherically continuous i.e. closed wall structure and a hollow interior. It is important in implementation of the process ofFIG. 1 in accordance with the present invention that the composition of the starting material be selected in conjunction with the method of shell fabrication so that the resulting intermediate shell product of Step 2 be of multicomponent glass composition wherein silica is the major constituent, and that the shell will be either phase separated or capable of phase separation into silica deficient zones carried by and separated from each other by a silica rich matrix. The art of phase separation in silicate glasses is not well understood. Doremus,Glass Science, John Wiley Sons 1973 , especially Chapter 4 entitled Phase Separation , provides a background discussion of this art. Most desirably, in terms of economy, the shells would undergo sufficient phase separation during the fabrication process.However, where such does not occur, or for better control of the degree of phase separation, the shells may be subjected to a separate heat treat operation Step 3 to promote phase separation. Such heat treatment is accomplished at a temperature less than the shell softening temperature, and for a time empirically determined for each glass composition and fabrication method to yield the desired amount of phase separation. In one working implementation of the process of FIG.1, a metal organic gel was formed to contain Na, K, Ca and Si as the glass forming components. The gel was dried and crushed, and the resulting gel particles were dropped through a tower furnace containing a substantial amount of water vapor. The presence of water vapor, long furnace residence time 10 to 30 seconds and high furnace temperature 15000C promote substantial volatilization of the Na and K oxides, resulting in glass shells consisting essentially of about 10 CaO, less than 2 Na2O and K2O, and the remainder SiO2. All percentages given in the present application are in terms of oxideequivalent mole percent. The resulting shells, having spherically continuous walls, were phase separated as a result of the manufacturing process.FIGS. 3 and 4 are micrographs of the interior of two resulting shells, and illustrate phase separation into calcia rich silica deficient zones separated from each other and carried by a surrounding silica rich matrix. In this connectIon, it will be appreciated that the amount of phase separation and the size of the silica deficient zones will vary with glass composition and fabrication and or heat treat parameters, which must be determined empirically for each application. Glasses of the so called VYCOR trademark composition, consisting of Na2O, B203 and SiO2, may be readily phase separated by heat treatment into a silica rich phase and a Na2O B 2O3 rich silica deficient phase. The same is true of the binary glass composition consisting essentially of about 10 soda and the remainder silica.Phase separability of other glass compositions, and the required parameters, must be determined empirically. In general, it is believed that glass compositions which exhibit a two liquid region within the high silica portion of the associated phase diagram may be employed, andCaO SiO2 and Na2O CaO SiO2 are examples of such compositions. Returning to FIG. 1, the phase separated shells are next subjected to a treatment Step 4 for selective removal of the more soluble silica deficient phase. The silica deficient phase may be readily leached by various dilute mineral acids. The product which remains is a hollow spherical shell 20 consisting of the silica rich matrix wall 22 and a multiplicity of wall through openings 24, where the silica deficient zones had been dissolved, extending through the matrix wall from exterior to interior.FIGS. 5 9 illustrate such shell products constructed in accordance with the present invention. FIGS. 5 and 6 are exterior micrographs of the same shell, with FIG. 6 being at twice the magnification of FIG. 5. The through openings are quite large and are readily visible as such. Note that all FIGS. 3 9 have the appropriate scale indicated therein. FIGS. 7 9 are exterior micrographs of three respectively different shells from a shell batch different from that of FIGS. 5 6. The through openings are of progressively decreasing size in FIGS. 7 9, illustrating differences obtained due to differing fabrication parameters and amounts of phase separation. In use as microcarriers for anchorage dependent cell cultivation, the glass shells resulting from the process of FIG. 1 exhibit substantially neutral buoyancy in the culture medium. The medium permeates the through openings, so that only the relatively small mass of the shell matrix wall affects buoyancy. The shells of the invention remain in suspension for substantial periods with little or no agitation and settle slowly to the bottom, which facilitates removal. For microcarrier applications, a shell diameter of 50 300 microns and an aspect ratio of at least 5 1 are suitable. Polymeric shells with wall through openings may be constructed following the process of FIG. 2. A suitable polymer solution is formed Step 1A and polymeric shells are formed Step 2A employing conventional technology.United States Patent Nos. 2,797,201 and 4,405,373 are illustrative of this art. To implement the process ofFIG. 2 in accordance with the present invention, the polymer composition must be of a type sensitive to radiation to induce cross linkage. The polycarbonates and other materials disclosed in United States Patent No.3,802,972 would be suitable, by way of example. The shells resulting from Step 2A are subjected to selective radiation treatment Step 3A to form cross linked throughzones in the shell wall, which may then be removed Step 4A in an etching operation using sodium or potassium hydroxide. The result is a polymeric shell 26 with wall through openings 28. FIG. 10 illustrates further processing the shells ofFIG. 1 in accordance with the thermal insulating aspects of the invention. Glass shells 20 with wall through openings 24 are subjected to a vacuum sintering operation Step 5 so as to close the wall through openings and thereby seal the evacuated interior. A sintering temperature in the range of 65 to 90 of the shell melting temperature would be suitable The resulting evacuated shell 30 is then coated Step 6 to form a discrete layer 32 on the outer shell surface. Preferably such layer consists of a heat reflective metallic material o on the order of 1000A thick. Conventional chemical or physical vapor deposition and rf or dc sputtering processes would be suitable. As an alternative, glass shell 20 may be coated directly in a high vacuum coating operation Step 6 so as to deposit a discrete metallic reflective surface layer 34 thereon. Layer 34 serves both to seal the evacuated interior of the composite shell 36, and to reflect heat from the shell body. Polymeric shells 26 FIG. 2 may be vacuum coated to obtain a similar product. In this embodiment, a coating of about 1000A thickness is desirable. Conventional high vacuum e beam evaporation and physical vapor deposition processes are suitable.Aluminum would bea suitable metal for either of the layers 32, 34 in FIG. 10. The invention claimed is
