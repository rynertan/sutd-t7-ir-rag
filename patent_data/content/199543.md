Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example, by reacting a compound of formula I with a suitable base affording a physiologically acceptable cation or by reacting a sufficiently basic compound of formula I with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. The necessary starting materials for the above procedures may be made by procedures which are selected from standard techniques of heterocyclic chemistry, techniques which are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, and techniques which are analogous to the above described procedures.

As an additional, similar illustration, the amines of formula IV, wherein T stands for COORh, CN, or one of the values defined for M and wherein X Y Z stands for C CRa Zb wherein Zb is S, may be obtained, for example, by alkylating an appropriate nitrobenzothiophene of structure XIX using a corresponding alkylating agent of the formula U.A¹.Q.A².T in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as stannic chloride and in a solvent such as dichloromethane, followed by a conventional reduction, as illustrated in the accompanying examples.

Starting materials of formula XVI may be obtained by conventional reduction of the nitro group of appropriate nitroindazole of formula XXI, followed by conversion of the resultant aminoindazole into the said starting material XVI by processes analogous to those described in process B and process F . The majority of the starting materials of formula III, IV and its nitro precursors , VI Rd other than hydrogen , VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, and XVII are novel and are provided as further features of the invention based on their utility as chemical intermediates. As stated previously, the compounds of formula I possess leukotriene antagonist properties. Thus, they antagonise the actions of one or more of the arachidonic acid metabolites known as leukotrienes, for example, C₄, D₄, and or E₄, which are known to be powerful spasmogens particularly in the lung , to increase vascular permeability and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and inflammation see J. L. Marx, The compounds of formula I are potent leukotriene antagonists and are useful whenever such activity is desired. For example, the compounds of formula I are of value as pharmacological standards for the development and standardization of new disease models and assays for use in developing new therapeutic agents for treating the diseases in which the leukotrienes are implicated. When used in the treatment of one or more of the above mentioned diseases, a compound of formula I is generally administered as an appropriate pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of formula I as defined hereinbefore together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier, the composition being adapted for the particular route of administration chosen. Such compositions are provided as a further feature of the invention. They may be obtained employing conventional procedures and excipients and may be in a variety of dosage forms. For example, they may be in the form of tablets, capsules, solutions or suspensions for oral administration in the form of suppositories for rectal administration in the form of sterile solutions or suspensions for administration by intravenous or intramuscular injection or infusion in the form of aerosols or nebuliser solutions or suspensions for administration by inhalation and in the form of powders together with pharmaceutically acceptable inert solid diluents such as lactose for administration by insufflation. For oral administration a tablet or capsule containing up to 250 mg. and typically 5 to 100 mg. of a compound of formula I may conveniently be used. Similarly, for intravenous or intramuscular injection or infusion a sterile solution or suspension containing up to 10 w w and typically 0.05 to 5 w w of a compound of formula I may conveniently be used. The dose of compound of formula I to be administered will necessarily be varied according to principles well known in the art taking account of the route of administration and the severity of the condition and the size and age of the patient under treatment. However, in general, a compound of formula I will be administered to a warm blooded animal such as man so that a dose in the range of, for example, 0.05 to 25 mg. kg. and usually 0.5 to 10 mg. kg. is received. The leukotriene antagonist properties of a compound of formula I may be demonstrated using standard tests. Thus, for example, they may be demonstrated Once tissue reproducibility has been established, test compounds are added to four baths following the 40 45 minute washout period. After a 10 minute incubation with test compound or vehicle, 8x10 ⁹M LTE₄, LTD₄ or LTC₄ is added and the response recorded. The percentage inhibition by the test compound or the percentage change in vehicle controls is calculated, for each tissue, according to the following equation inhibition 100 multiplied by mg. tension increase of preceding response minus mg. tension increase in presence of compound divided by mg. tension increase of preceding response. The mean percentage change for vehicle controls and test compound are calculated and evaluated for significant differences by Students t test for unpaired data. Tissues exposed to test compounds were retested for responsiveness to LTE₄, LTD₄ or LTC₄ following a 25 minute washout period. If tissue responsiveness was equal to responsiveness preceding exposure to the test compound additional studies were conducted. If responsiveness was not restored by the washing procedure, the tissues were discarded. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, is present at 5x10 ⁶M in all the determinations. In general, the compounds of formula I demonstrate statistically significant activity as LTC₄, LTD₄ and or LTE₄ antagonists in the above test at a concentration of about 10 ⁵M or much less. The selectivity of action as leukotriene antagonists as opposed to non specific smooth muscle depressants may be shown by carrying out the above Activity as a leukotriene antagonist may also be demonstrated The invention will now be illustrated by the following non limiting examples in which, unless stated otherwise A stirred solution of methyl 4 5 amino indol 3 ylmethyl 3 methoxybenzoate A 0.2 g. in dichloromethane 5 ml. under an atmosphere of nitrogen, was treated with N methylmorpholine 0.25 g. , followed by hexanoyl chloride 0.103 g. .
