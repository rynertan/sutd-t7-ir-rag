# FABRIC CONDITIONING AGENTS, COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSES

## Abstract
Through the wash fabric conditioning compositions are disclosed especially for use with machine dryers that minim ize adverse reactions taking place in the wash that otherwise adversely affect the performance of the separate detergent and fabric conditioning ingredients. This is accomplished by utilizing salts of certain tertiary amines and carboxylic acids in the form of 0.05 to 2 mm. nodules that pass virtually unchanged through the wash and rinse become entangled in the fabrics when spun or wrung out and then melt, spread, and condition the fabrics when heated in a dryer.
