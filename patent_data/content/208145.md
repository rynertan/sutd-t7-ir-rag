## Description
The present invention relates to a light sensitive composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a light sensitive composition that is capable of efficient cross linking upon exposure to light, which can be developed with an aqueous alkali developer, and which is suitable for use in the making of a presensitized plate from which a lithographic printing plate having an increased press life can be prepared. Diazonium compounds are widely used as sensitizers in presensitized printing materials, and the most commonly employed diazonium compounds are diazo resins, typically the condensation products of p diazodiphenylamine and formaldehyde. In preparing a light sensitive layer for use in a presensitized lithographic printing plate, the diazo resin may be used either alone as shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,714,066 i.e., in the absence of any binder or in admixture with a binder as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 30604 1975 the term OPI as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,275,138. In most of the diazosensitized lithographic printing plates manufactured today, a diazonium compound is used together with a polymer binder in order to provide for more increased press life. Light sensitive layers which comprise a diazonium compound and a polymer binder may be divided into two types, depending on the type of developer used to remove i.e., develop the layer in unexposed areas 1 the alkali developable type of light sensitive layer which is treated with an aqueous alkali developer, and 2 the solvent developable type of light sensitive layer which is treated with an organic solvent based developer. The alkali developer type is increasingly used today, principally for safety and environmental reasons due to problems relating to disposal of the fatigued developer. How well this type of light sensitive layer performs is determined by the properties of the binder used. The binder may be rendered alkali devlopable either by copolymerizing it with a carboxylic acid containing monomer as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 30604 1975, or by reacting the hydroxyl group in polyvinyl alcohol with a cyclic acid anhydride such as phthalic anhydride in order to introduce the carboxylic acid group into the polymer as shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,861,058. Whichever method is used, the resulting polymer has only a low level of abrasion resistance because of its structure, and the presensitized plate using this type of carboxylic acid containing polymer as a binder in the light sensitive layer provides a lithographic printing plate having a short press life. When polyvinyl acetal is used as the binder, a sturdy film is formed having high abrasion resistance however, the lithographic printing plate sensitized by a layer containing polyvinyl acetal as the binder is of the organic solvent developable type described above and cannot be treated with aqueous alkali developers. It has been proposed that the abrasion resistant polyvinyl acetal is modified to make the compound alkali soluble, and that the so modified polyvinyl acetal is mixed with a diazonium compound. Light sensitive compositions prepared by this method are described in British Patent Nos. 1,370,316 and 1,600,871 and U.S. Patent No. 3,847,614. The binder in the light sensitive composition described in British Patent No. 1,370,316 contains an arylsulfonyl urethane which is prepared from a sulfonyl isocyanate but this compound has the drawback that it is very difficult to synthesize the sulfonyl isocyanate industrially at economically feasible costs. The method described in U.S. Patent No. 3,847,614 consists of copolymerizing vinyl acetate with a monomer containing a carboxylic acid and subsequently treating the copolymer such that it is saponified and converted to the acetal form. However, this method has the disadvantage that the saponified copolymer is not converted into the acetal form in a sufficient amount, causing unsatisfactory abrasion resistance of the light sensitive composition. The light sensitive composition described in British Patent No. 1,600,871 suffers from the low sensitivity of diazosulfonate. The present invention has been accomplished with a view toward solving the aforementioned problems of these prior art techniques discussed above. One object, therefore, of the present invention, is to provide a light sensitive composition comprising a diazonium compound and a binder and which is capable of efficient cross linking upon exposure to light, can be developed with an aqueous alkali solution, and which has a longer press life. Another object of the present invention is to provide a light sensitive composition comprising a diazonium compound and a binder which is particularly suitable for use in the manufacture of presensitized lithographic printing plates. These objects of the present invention can be attained by a light sensitive composition comprising a diazonium compound and a polymer having the recurring units represented by the following general formula I Examples of the diazonium compound that may be used in the present invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,867,147 and 2,632,703. Particularly useful diazo resins are those which are the condensation products of aromatic diazonium slats and active carbonyl containing compounds such as formaldehyde. Preferred diazo resins include hexafluorophosphates, tetrafluoroborates and phosphates of the condensation product of p diazodiphenylamine and formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. Also preferred are sulfonates e.g., p toluenesulfonate and 2 methoxy 4 hydroxy 5 benzoylbenzenesulfonate , phosphinates e.g., benzenephosphinate , hydroxy containing compound salts e.g., 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone salts and organic carboxylic acid salts of the condensation product of p diazodiphenylamine and formaldehyde. As described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No 27141 1983, 3 methoxy 4 diazo diphenyl amine may be condensed with 4,4 bis methoxy methyl diphenylether and the resulting condensate may be converted to a mesitylene sulfonic acid salt. The binder to be used in the present invention which has the recurring units represented by the general formula I may be prepared by the following procedures 1 polyvinyl alcohol is converted to the acetal form by treatment with an aldehyde 2 the remaining OH is reacted with an acid anhydride and, 3 part of the resulting carboxylic acid compound is reacted with a halogen substituted compound containing a hydroxyl or cyano group. If required, the remaining OH after the above step 1 may be reacted with an The polymer binder used in the present invention comprises the five recurring monomer units represented by the general formula I . The first component, having n₁ designating its molar percent, is a vinyl acetal monomer unit the second component, having n₂ designating its molar percent is a vinyl alcohol monomer unit the third component, having n₃ designating its molar percent is an unsubstituted ester monomer unit the fourth component, having n₄ designating its molar percent is an ester monomer unit having a carboxyl group and the fifth component, having n₅ designating its molar percent, is an ester bond containing monomer unit having a hydroxyl or cyano group. Each of these components may have one or more constituent units. The first vinyl acetal monomer unit is formed by reacting a vinyl alcohol unit with an aliphatic aldehyde which may be substituted by, e.g., a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, a tertiary amino group, an alkoxyl group, a cyano group, a nitro group, an amido group, an ester group, a urethane group or an ureido group. Illustrative aliphatic aldehydes include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butylaldehyde, pentylaldehyde, hexylaldehyde, glyoxylic acid, N,N dimethylformamido di n butylacetal, bromoacetaldehyde, chloroacetaldehyde, 3 hydroxy n butylaldehyde, 3 methoxy n butylaldehyde, 3 dimethylamino 2,2 dimethylpropionaldehyde and cyanoacetaldehyde. It should, however, be understood that these are not exclusive examples of the aliphatic aldehyde serving as a reactant for the formation of the first vinyl acetal monomer unit. Substituent R₂ in the third monomer unit is an unsubstituted alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and a methyl or ethyl group is particularly preferred from the viewpoint of developability. The substituent R₃ in the fourth monomer unit is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group substituted by a carboxyl group and having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. This monomer unit is formed by reacting an acid anhydride with the residual OH group in polyvinyl acetal. Typical examples of the acid anhydride are succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride and cis 4 cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboxylic anhydride, but other cyclic acid anhydrides may be employed. It should be noted that R₃ may be further substituted in addition to the carboxyl group, and examples of such additional substituents include Substituent R₄ in the fifth monomer unit is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group substituted by a hydroxyl or cyano group and occasionally by other substituents and may be obtained by esterifying the carboxylic acid in R₃ in the fourth monomer unit with a halogen substituted compound further substituted with a hydroxyl or cyano group. Illustrative but by no means limiting examples of R₄ are listed below The range of n₁ in the general formula I is from about 5 to about 85 mol , preferably 25 70 mol . The film strength undesirably decreases by decreasing the value of n₁ below about 5 mol . Increasing the value of n₁ above about 85 mol is also undesirable since this leads to a decrease in the proportion of the other components. The range of n₂ is from 0 to about 60 mol , preferably 0 to 30 mol . The range of n₃ is from 0 to about 20 mol , preferably 0 to 15 mol . The range of n₄ is from about 3 to about 60 mol , preferably 10 55 mol . Increasing the value of n₄ above about 60 mol causes excessive swelling in exposed areas upon contact with an alkali developer. On the other hand, decreasing the value of n₄ below about 3 mol , causes difficulty in development with an alkali developer. The range of n₅ is such that it is greater than 0 mol and is not greater than about 60 mol . Preferably, n₅ is within the range of 3 40 mol . Decreasing the value of n₅ leads to a lower degree of cross linking and a greater tendency of the exposed areas to swell. Increasing the value of n₅ above about 60 mol is also undesirable since this leads to a decrease in the proportion of the other components. The appropriate range of the molecular weight of the binder is from about 5 x 10³ to about 4 x 10⁵ as measured by gel permeation chromatography, and a preferred range is from 5 x 10⁴ to 3 x 10⁵. The high molecular weight polymer binders described above may be used either alone or in admixture. The light sensitive composition of the present invention contains these high molecular weight compounds in amounts ranging from about 50 to about 99.5 wt , preferably from 55 to 95 wt . The light sensitive composition of the present invention contains the high molecular weight polymer and the diazonium compound in any ratio thereof. Preferably, the diazonium compound is contained in an amount of 0.5 to 50 wt of the light sensitive composition, and in an amount of 1 to 50 wt , more preferably 5 to 30 wt of the total amount of the diazonium compound and the high molecular weight polymer. The light sensitive composition of the present invention may also contain other resins in amounts not exceeding about 50 wt of the above described polymers. Examples of resins which may also be present include miscible resins which contain a hydroxyl group, an amido group or urethane group more illustrative examples are polyamide, epoxy, polyurethane and acrylic resins. Some improvement in adhesion may be attained by incorporating these additional resins. The performance of the light sensitive composition of the present invention may be further improved by adding dyes, pigments, stabilizers, fillers, surfactants and plasticizers. Advantageous dyes are oil soluble dyes such as C.I. 26105 Oil Red RR , C.I. 21260 Oil Scarlet 300 , C.I. 74350 Oil Blue , C.I. 52015 Methylene Blue , C.I. 42555 Crystal Violet , and C.I. 42595 Victoria Pure Blue . Examples of stabilizers which may be used include phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, oxalic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, dipicolinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and 2 methoxy 4 hydroxy 5 benzoyl benzenesulfonic acid. The light senstive composition of the present invention is usually dissolved in a solvent before it is coated onto a suitable support. The coated composition is then dried prior to being available for use. The composition is coated on the support in an amount from about 0.1 to about 5 g m², preferably from 0.3 to 3 g m², the coating weight being calculated on a dry basis. Suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n butanol, t butanol, 2 methoxy ethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, 2 methoxyethyl acetate, ethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N dimethylformamide, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and mixtures thereof. Examples of the support on which the light sensitive composition of the present invention may be coated include paper, paper laminated with plastics e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene , plates formed from metals such as aluminum, including aluminum alloys , zinc and copper films of various plastics such as cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose nitrate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polycarbonate and polyvinyl acetal as well as paper or plastic films laminated or vapor deposited with the above mentioned metals. Aluminum plates are particularly preferred because of their extremely good dimensional stability and low cost. Also preferred are composite sheets wherein an aluminum sheet is bonded to a polyethylene terephthalate film as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 18327 1973. Supports having metallic surfaces, particularly those having an aluminum surface, are preferably subjected to an appropriate surface treatment such as graining, immersion in an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, potassium fluorozirconate or phosphate salt, or anodization. Aluminum plates which are suitable for use as supports are described, for example, in the following references U.S. Patent No. 2,714,066, wherein the aluminum plate is immersed in an aqueous solution of sodium silicate Japanese Patent Publication No. 5125 1972, wherein the aluminum plate is anodized and then immersed in an aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt of silicic acid and U.S. Patent No. 4,476,006, wherein the aluminum plate is surface treated by the combination of mechanical and electrolytic roughening techniques. Anodization is performed by passing an electric current through an electrolyte solution in which the anode i.e., an aluminum plate is immersed. The electrolyte solution comprises one or more aqueous or non aqueous solutions of an inorganic acid e.g. phosphoric acid, chromic acid, sulfuric acid or boric acid , or an organic acid e.g., oxalic acid or sulfamic acid or salts thereof. It is also preferred to seal the tiny holes that may be left on the support after graining or anodization. Such sealing treatments may be carried out by immersing the aluminum plate in an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, boiling water or a boiling aqueous solution containing an inorganic or organic salt. Alternatively, the plate may be treated in a steam bath to effect sealing. Another effective surface treatment is electrodeposition using a silicate as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,658,662. The light sensitive composition coated onto a support is processed by the following procedures. First, it is exposed through a transparent original having a line image, halftone image or any other appropriate image, and is subsequently developed with an aqueous alkali developer to provide a relief image which is negative relative to the original image. Illustrative light sources that may be used in the exposure step include a carbon arc lamp, a mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, a tungsten lamp and a metal halide lamp. The light sensitive composition of the present invention has a high degree of solubility in organic solvents which are used to prepare coating solutions for application to the support. The composition is also capable of being developed to a high degree with an alkali developer which is used to remove unexposed areas after imagewise exposure following the coating and drying steps. The relief image formed by such development exhibits high abrasion resistance, good ink receptivity and strong adhesion to the support. Because of these features, a lithographic printing plate using the light sensitive composition of the present invention is consistent in its running characteristics and is capable of producing an increased number of copies of excellent quality. The following synthesis examples and working examples are included for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.
