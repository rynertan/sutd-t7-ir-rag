# Clutch cover assembly.

## Abstract
In each opening 36 in the side wall 14 of the cover 4 is a radial lug 34 of the pressure plate 6 . Alongside each opening the rim flange is formed with stepped platforms 38 and 40 . Each lug is rivetted at 42 to a respective drive strap 44 rivetted at 46 to the corresponding platform 40 . Each drive strap 44 is formed by a stack of leaf springs, one of those leaves being extended to form a resilient latch 50 with a hooked end 52 . If the pressure plate is pushed into the cover after manufacture, the latches 50 can be pushed for the latch hooks 52 to catch on the platforms 38 to that subse quent urging to the pressure plate by the diaphragm spring causes the hooks to firmly engage the platforms 38 and so prevent the pressure plate moving outwardly of the cover, and thus straining of the release straps is avoided. During the mounting of the cover assembly, with a clutch driven plate in position between fly wheel and pressure plate, the tightening of the bolts fixing the cover to the fly wheel, draws cover 4 axially towards the fly wheel causing the driven plate to be clamped against the fly wheel by the pressure plate 6 which is now held axially stationary as the cover is moved relative to the pressure plate towards the fly wheel by furth er tightening of the bolts. This relative movement has the same effect as moving the pressure plate 6 into the cover 4 and interrupts engagement of the latches with the platforms 38 so that the latches 50 spring aside to their normal posi tions shown in dotted lines where they now avoid the plat forms 38 during any subsequent axial movements of the pressure plate in either direction.
