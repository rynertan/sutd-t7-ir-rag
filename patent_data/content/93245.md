# Radiometric imaging system.

## Abstract
Disclosed in Figure 1 is a method and apparatus for a radiometric imaging system 10 for enhancing target detec tion, particularly in the millimeter wave frequency range. A radiometer 12 which is a passive thermal receiver, detects the reflected and emitted radiation of targets 14 within a predetermined antenna receiver beamwidth. By scanning the radiometer over a target area 14, a thermal image is created. At millimeter wave frequencies, the received emissions from the target area are highly depen dent on the emissivity of the target of interest. Foliage will appear hot due to its high emissivity and metals will appear cold due to their low emissivities. A bistatic noise power illuminator 16 is periodically actuated to illuminate the target of interest. When the illuminator 16 is actuated, the role of emissivity is reversed, namely poorly emissive targets will generally be good reflectors which in the presence of an illuminator will appear hot . The highly emissive targets 14 such as foliage and dirt which absorb most of the transmitted energy will appear almost the same as in a non illuminated, passive image. Using a data processor 20, the intensity of the passive image is subtracted from the intensity of the illuminated, active image which thereby cancels the backgound foliage, dirt, etc. and the reflective metallic targets 14 are enhanced for readout. A CRT display, for example, produces an enhanced image of the target area 14 of interest.
