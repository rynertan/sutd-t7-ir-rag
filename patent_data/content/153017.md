# An electrophoretic separator.

## Abstract
A continuous flow electrophoretic separator 10 comprises a cylindrical stator 12 and a tubular rotor 14 defining an annular chamber 28 therebetween, through which a carrier liquid 44 is passed and in which electrophoresis of a migrant material in jected into the carrier liquid 44 takes place. An inlet for the mi grant material is defined within the stator 12 and comprises a supply duct 34, a first annular chamber 140, a second annular chamber 144, a peripheral slot 150, ducts 134 providing com munication between the supply duct and the first chamber, and channels 142 providing communication between the first chamber and the second chamber. Migrant material flows from the second chamber through the slot to emerge uniformly into the carrier liquid as a well defined narrow layer.
