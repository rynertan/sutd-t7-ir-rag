# Cylindrical magnetron sputtering cathode.

## Abstract
The cylindrical magnetron sputtering cathode 10 of the present invention essentially comprises a tubular target 20 having a face 20a of material to be sputtered, and a magnet assembly 45 disposed behind the back face of said tubular target for generating magnetic fields having flux lines which form arch portions 50,51 over the sputtering face. This magnet assembly 45 more specifically consists of a plural ity of equiangularly spaced axially extending radially magne tized magnets arranged in such a manner as to form over the sputtering face 20a a plurality of equiangularly spaced axially extending straight arch portions 50 connected to each other by arcuate arch end portions 51 , whereby defining at least one closed loop arch 52 over said sputter ing face. This magnetron sputtering cathode further compris es closure means for delimitating in combination with the back face of said tubular target a cylindrical tight chamber enclosing the magnet assembly, as well as means for axially circulating a liquid coolant within said tight chamber, whereby ensuring a proper cooling of said cathode by enabling said liquid coolant to freely flow along the longitu dinal spaces 49 delimitated between adjacent magnets of said assembly.
