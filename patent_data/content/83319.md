# Portable device for infusing insulin on the basis of glycemical measurement.

## Abstract
The application relates to a device made by a concentric dual lumen catheter 1 1 , a pump 1 2 , a small hemofilter 1 3 , a glucose sensor 1 4 which, by means of a microinfu sion pump 1 6 with a stepping motor controlled by a microprocessor 1 5 can, through another concentric dual lumen catheter, inject insulin 1 9 or glucose 1 10 into the blood stream depending on glycemic levels.
