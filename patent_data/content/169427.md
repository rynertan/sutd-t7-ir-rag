# Mass flow rate meter.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a mass flow rate meter, whose collision plate 1 is supported by means of spring plates 5 on a body 6, 7 . The collision plate 1 is able to move in direction B perpendicular to the direction of the spring plates 5 . The stiffness of spring plates 5 can be utilized to obtain a sufficiently high resonance frequency for collision plate 1 so that the periodic nature of mass supply would not lead to resonance oscillation of said collision plate.
