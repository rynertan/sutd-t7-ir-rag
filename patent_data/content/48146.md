## Description
SOLID STATE OPTICALLY COUPLED ELECTRICAL POWER SWITCHDESCRIPTION This invention relates to solid state optically coupled switches. Depending on the application and power level, such switches can be characterized as solid state relays SSR s or analog switches. It is common in the electronics industry, particularly in modern telecommunications, test or computer equipment, to have control circuits operating at different voltage levels from load circuits. For example, it is common to operate 120 VAC industrial machines or 48 VDC telephone apparatus from 5 VDC computer logic. As a result, the need arises to transfer data or control signals between such dissimilar voltage references without physically connecting the two circuits, i.e. with isolation. As the state of the art evolved in the 1960 s and 1970 s, the isolation functions had to meet increasingly stringent criteria regarding miniaturization, long life under repetitive conditions, and low operating power. Satisfying a large part of these criteria are four categories of isolated switching elements a Optical Couplers These are generally low current under 100 mA elements employing a light emitting diode LED as a light emitter and a variety of sericonductor devices as the sensor. b Solid State Relays SSR s with Optical Isolation These generally employ an internal optical coupler in combination with other semiconductor elements to switch power. c Solid State Relays with Transformer Isolation d Reed Relays While the primary purpose of couplers is only to isolate, the purpose of reed relays and SSR s is not only to isolate but also to provide power gain. Over the past ten years, as isolators and SSR s have achieved a degree of maturity and widespread acceptance, it has also become apparent that a variety of limitations exist. For example, couplers generally are limited in current and voltage. They are usually limited to DC loads and are particularly susceptible to damage when switching inductive loads or when operating in an overload current mode. Furthermore, they exhibit a voltage offset of about one volt because of the use of bipolar photo semiconductors. This means that voltages under one volt cannot be switched and that audio signals cannot be faithfully reproduced without the use of biasing. While SSR s can offer considerable power gain and isolation, they are generally relegated to being designed for AC or DC operation, but not both. Also, an AC load SSR employing a thyristor as the output element is subject to false latchup. In any event, such an SSR is not capable of being turned off in mid cycle. Reed relays experience difficulties with reactive loads and, although faster than conventional mechanical relays, are still slower than solid state switches.Also, reed relays are limited in the degree they can switch momentarily high currents or voltages.Finally, under very high switching rates, their mechanical life has a severe limitation. Because of these limitations, increasing attention is being given to field effect transistors FETs . Modern FETs offer the absence of significant voltage offset and thermal runaway effects, extremely high power gain, ability to operate at very high frequencies, and under appropriate conditions, the ability to switch AC or DC with equal ease. The idea of using FET switches for relay type functions, and related developments go back to as early as 1955 and have been made since by several skilled laboratories. In spite of these many efforts going back over two decades, optically activated FET power switches have not proven commercially significant because of their inability to meet the specific cost and performance requirements of certain defined industrial and telecommunications applications. It would be advantageous therefore to provide commercially useful, optically isolated power FET switches which 1. can operate at low millivolt or high above 300 V load voltage, 2. can operate at low picoamps or high above several amperes current, 3. can switch DC of either polarity or AC up to at least 100 KHz i.e., capability of sub microsecond switching speeds , 4. have immunity to false latchup as with thyristors , 5. have immunity to secondary breakdown as with bipolar transistors , 6. have switching speeds controllable over wide range for switching transient control , 7. can operate from very low input signals, 8. can operate at high temperature, 9. can be readily arranged in series or parallel arrays for extended current or voltage capability, 10. can duplicate the break before make configuration of Form C mechanical relays. 11. can exhibit ON resistance under 100 milliohms and OFF resistance over 10,000 megohms so to approach the isolation of reed relays. The invention accordingly provides a solid state optically coupled electrical switch wherein light from a solid state light emitter L 1 is coupled refractively to a solid state, photovoltaic series diode array D V laterally through a thin, clear film so as to act as a DC to DC transformer and create a voltage, and wherein such voltage is applied to a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET Q 1 having a gate, a source and a drain, between the gate and source and cause the MOSFET to change from a first impedance state to a second impedance state. Thus in a switch in accordance with the invention, a diode LED chip constituting the light emitter can be placed adjacent to an integrated circuit sensor chip constituting the photovoltaic array. When activated by light from the LED, the photovoltaic array can create a voltage of at least 8 volts. This voltage, applied between the source and gate of the power MOSFET transistor causes the transistor s impedance to change from many megohms down to a few ohms. The light emitter may consist of a liquid epitaxy gallium or gallium aluminum arsenide LED to provide greater brightness than a simple diffused LED. The photovoltaic array may contain 16 diodes connected in series with connections at either end or at the midpoint of the series string. The sensor diode array can be fabricated using dielectric isolation techniques.This eliminates parasitic light generated voltages which could exist at various PN junctions if conventional isolation diffusion integrated circuit processing were used. A low voltage MOSFET may be used to enhance the overall switching speed. Light is coupled from the LED to the sensor through a thin, clear film. Coupling is by refractive means, as described in U.S. Patent Application 065 072 filed 9 August 1979, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The diode string or array, when activated by light, generates slightly more than 0.5 volts per diode, or slightly above 8 volts total. The sensor chip size can be chosen so as to deliver only several microamperes, through larger chips could, of course, deliver more current. However, relatively low current is adequate to drive the gate of the FET because of its high input impedance. The MOSFET may be an enhancement mode or a depletion mode MOSFET, the switching of the latter from a low to a high impedance state affording normally closed relay contact behaviour analogous to that of normally closed relays. Two of the MOSFETs can be employed, the voltage generated at the photovoltaic array D V by the lightemitter L 1 being simultaneously applied between the gate and source of each MOSFET, the MOSFETs being connected in series opposition with common sources and common gates, and being of a structure that permits them to withstand off state voltages of more than a few volts in one direction. The series opposition connection permits one MOSFET to sustain off state voltage regardless of the output voltage polarity. Moreover, when the diode array is stimulated, bothMOSFETs change from a high to a low impedance to provide as a net result an optically coupled AC switch. The diode array can be directly coupled to theMOSFET without blocking br steering diodes or the like. The siwtch is thereby capable of switching AC or DC it does not exhibit voltage offset and thereby readily switches AC voltages of the order of a hundred millivolts. The MOSFET can be such that its turn on and turn off speeds are limited by the time taken for the gate capacitance to charge from the photovoltaic diode voltage or discharge through the equivalent gate source impedance. This length of switching time has the positive effect of essentially limiting circuit turn on rate of change of current with time di dt and turn off rate of change of voltage with time dv dt and prevents the generation of switching induced radio frequency interference RFI regardless of load power factor, an attribute not readily feasible with conventional FRIreducing, zero voltage or zero current axis thyristor switching circuits. The switch of the invention can include a second photovoltaic array D V2 and a second depletion modeMOSFET Q 2 , and wherein each of a pair of the depletion mode MOSFETs is activated by a respective one of the photovoltaic arrays in a mutually exclusive manner such that one or the other MOSFET is turned off, and wherein depletion FET circuit configurations are used whereby the switch is more readily turned off than turned on. Turn off then is faster than turn on, whereby an operation of single pole, double throw, break before make operation analogous to mechanical relay configuration Form C is achieved in a solid state switching apparatus. The diodes of the diode array are located around the light emitter so as to be equally illuminated thereby, and the invention also provides a series array of dielectrically isolated photovoltaic diodes fabricated in a wagon wheel spoke geometry and coated with a hemispherical clear film such that a light emitter located centrally of the photovoltaic array illuminates all diodes substantially equally. The invention additionally provides a photovoltaically activated bidirectional FET switch wherein a pair of output FETs is activated by a fixed power supply connected to their gates and sources through a photovolatically activated, low current, low capacitance, high speed FET whereby the output FETs experience rapid charging of their gate source capacitances and corresponding rapid turn on, with the output FET handling load current and the driver FET being of a low input capacitance type and each of the two FETs being driven by separate photovoltaic generators which are activated by the same light sources, to thereby effect rapid charging of the output device gate source capacitance and resultant turn on.Thus in carrying the present invention into effect, FET technology is combined with certain optoelectronic means alone or supplemented by electromagnetic means to achieve both superior switching characteristics and fabrication means compatible with low cost mass production. The invention is further described below, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C are circuit diagrams of first, second and third switches embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a side view of the first switch Fig. 3 is a sectional side view of a MOSFET included in the first switch Fig. 4 is a graph relating ON resistance of theMOSFET with gate voltage Fig. 5 is a sectional side view of the third switch Figs. 6, 7 and 8 are circuit diagrams of fourth fifth and sixth switches embodying the invention Figs. 9 and 10A are plan views of alternative photovoltaic diode arrays Figs. lOB and lOC are an equivalent circuit diagram and a sectional side view of the array ofFig. lOB and Figs. 11 and 11A are a circuit diagram and an equivalent circuit of a seventh switch embodying the invention. Fig. 1A shows a simple form of switch embodying the invention in which an LED L 1 when activated by a control current of about 10 mA generates infrared radiation which is sensed simultaneously by all the diodes of an integrated diode array D V comprising sixteen series connected diodes. Fig. 2 depicts the light path by which the radiation from the LED L 1 is refractively coupled with the diodes, by way of a thin clear film. The output of the array D V is connected as shown to the gate and source ot a MOSFET Q 1, the geometry of which is shown in cross section in Fig. 3.MOSFET Q 1 exhibits an equivalent capacitance CE between its gate and source, which is of the order of several dozen picofarads for a chip 0.050 inches by 0.050 inches 1.27 mm. by 1.27 mm. When the array D V is activated, the capacitanceCE charges to the voltage generated through the D V series equivalent resistance g which, for a sensor chip of about 0.040 inches by 0.040 inches 1.01 mm. by 1.01 mm. , is about 1 Megohm. The turn on time for the MOSFET Q 1 is the time it takes for the capacitance CE to charge to a high enough voltage for the MOSFET to have approached its lowest ON resistance. In this case, the two RE CE time constants put the MOSFET Q 1 gate voltage above 6 volts, a value where Q 1 is essentially full on. Fig. 4 depicts the effect of gate voltage V on ON Q resistance. It may take, for example, about 20 50 microseconds to charge capacitance CE and turn on the MOSFET Q l. When the signal to the LED L 1 is removed the diode array D V stops generating a voltage. However, the charge remains on the capacitance CE, thereby holding the MOSFET Q 1 on until stray leakage paths eventually discharge the capacitance CE. Since several seconds could be required for discharge, alternate means for faster turn off are normally required. Inclusion in the circuit of a bias resistor of several megohms as shown in Fig. 1B speeds the discharge of capacitance CE, but has the effect of increasing turn on time. This is acceptable where switching speed is not critical. Use of a resistor of appropriate lower resistance would theoretically discharge capacitance CE in 20 50 microseconds but can unfortunately load down the diode array D V excessively to where full or adequate turn on does not take place. The ideal arrangement, then, is one where the fullD V voltage is applied during turn on with minimal biasing, but where maximum biasing is attained during turn off. Such an arrangement is provided in the switch circuit illustrated in Fig. 1C, where the bias resistor of Fig. 1B is replaced by an P channel depletion mode junction FET Q 2. A second diode array D V2 is connected to the gate of FET Q 2. FET Q 2, being a depletion mode FET, is normally in a low impedance state, well under 1,000 ohms. When LED L 1 activates diode array D V2, Q 2 sees D V2 total voltage at its gate, causing Q 2 to be rapidly pinched off to a high impedance, thereby allowing enhanced turn on time. When LED L 2 is deactivated, D V2 voltage collapses and FET Q 2 is no longer pinched off and drops to a low impedance, thereby causing rapid CE discharge and turn off of MOSFET Q 1. The photovoltaic diode generators or arrays D V and 3 2 and the FET Q 2 are fabricated on the same chip using dielectric isolation. Each diode is electrically isolated from the next except for surface interconnect metallurgy, which proceeds from one anode to the next cathode. The oxide tub surrounding each diode prevents electrical interaction except between the P and N regions of each diode through surface interconnect metalization. Such an array produced by conventional integrated circuit diffusion isolation technology would result in undesirable photovoltaic action at each isolation junction, cancelling out the desired effects. The dielectric process provides near perfect isolation and eliminates the many external wire connections associated with individual diode chips. It also provides the maximum diode element location concentration for receiving light from LED L l. Fig. 5 depicts the cross sectional geometry of the diodes and the bias FET Q 2. While Figs. lA, 1B and 1C reflect basic configurations, an embodIment of the invention better suited for many practical applications is shown in Fig. 6. In the Fig. 6 circuit, the voltage generated by diode array D V is simultaneously applied to the gates and sources of FETs Q 1 and Q 2, which are connected source to source. In operation,FETs Q 1 and Q 2 can each block voltage in one direction, but can withstand only about one volt in the reverse direction. In Fig. 6, however, either Q l or Q 2 is always in the full blocking mode, thereby blocking load voltage regardless of the polarity. If a vertical DMOS structure is used, the conductivity is modulated with either polarity of load voltage. Hence, with a relatively high AC load voltage, either FET Q l or FET Q 2 bears the majority of the blocking requirement, but both drop to a low impedance with an L 1 signal. The final ON resistance, then, is the sum of those of FETs Q 1 and Q 2. In this approach, no steering diodes are required and, therefore, an ideal condition of no voltage offset is maintained. The elimination of steering diodes means that dissipation and signal distortion are minimized. Furthe .are, high voltage AC above 30G V switching can be achieved. Steering diodes of the low forward drop of Schottky or gold doped type are not available today in high voltage, low leakage versions . It has been noted that the use of a depletion modeFET such as FET Q 2 of Fig. 1C can enhance turn off.It can also be noted that the addition of a photovoltaically activated FET Q 2 as in Fig. 7, can enhance turn or speed as follows LED L l is so arranged as to simultaneously activate diode arrays D V and D V2. The consequential reduced impedance of FET Q 2 causes FET Q 1 gate capacitance to suddenly begin charging toward theHocking voltage through FET Q 2. FET Q 2 has an input capacitance much smaller than that of Q 1 by an order of magnitude equal to the degree of turn on speed enhancement. Since Q 2 handles negligible current, it can be a much smaller chip than Q 1, thereby facilitating a geometry contributing less capacitance. The result is the rapid charge of the Q 1 gate capacitance and faster turn on, which could not occur where gate capacitance to charge directly through the high impedance D V voltage source. With the means for turn on just described, and the means of Fig. 1 C for turn off, it is possible to fabricate a bidirectional, distortion free AC power pli ier or switch capable of operating at frequencies above 1 Megahertz. Unlike a thyristor, the switzh exhibits no regenerative mechanism and hence, cannot be latched on by a voltage transient. With vertical DMOS technology, it is possible to integrate all elements, except for the LED, on a single chip using dielectric isolation technology. The single chip would include the photovoltaic diodes. The circuit of Fig. 8 comprises a unique configuration in which transformer action augments the isolated photovoltaic drive scheme in order to achieve very fast turn on and turn off times. In the Fig. 8 circuit, LED L 1 is in parallel with the primary of a pulse transformer T l. hten the input signal to the primary abruptly rises to a positive level, LED L 1 is illuminated. This would normally cause voltage generator or diode array D V to begin charging CE, in turn causing FET Q 1 to turn on in a time comparable to the time constant of CE and the internal equivalent resistance. However, the rise in input signal is seen at the secondary of T 1 as a positive pulse which rapidly charges CE through a forward biased zener diode, Dz. Once the input signal eaches an on quiescent state, the positive pulse at the T 1 secondary disappears, but the charge on CE in maIntained by the diode array D V. When the input signal drops to zero, L 1 ceases its illumination and the D V capacitance CE discharges through available leakage paths, or, if one were connected, a gate to scurce bias resistor. Turn off time under this condition would, in certain applications, be excessive. With transformer augmentation, the loss of input signal and cessation or the transformer T 1 primary current not only causes LED L l s output to cease, but also causes a negative pulse to appear at the T l secondary, causing zener diode D to break over in the reverse direction, effectively grounding the gate ofFET Q 1. As a result, CE is discharged, abruptly causing extremely fast turn off of FET Q 1. It is desirable i the circuit of Fig. 8 that the zener diode D be specIfied at a voltage approximately equal to that of the p.stovoltaic generator or diode array D V and that the voltage appearing at the secondary of transformer T 1, especially at turn off, be greater than the breakdown voltage of this zener diode. The result is a majnetically and optically isolated switch capable of switching speeds on the order of hundreds of n noseconds or better. Since the transformer T 1 is needed only during switching and the switch depends on diode array D V during the on period, the transformer can be small in size. In various prior art technologies, it has been demonstrated that a DC voltage could be used to operate an oscillator. The oscillator s high frequency output could be transformer coupled, rectified, filtered and applied to a transistor base or FET gate to turn it on. Such approaches, however, are more complex and introduce filter induced delays along with an oscillation signal which can be undesirable, particularly when switching low level or highfrequency signals. The circuits of Figs. 1, 6, 7 and 8 provide simplified switching without the hazard of spurious signals or beat frequencies. While the primary mode of fabrication is based on thick film hybrid circuit technology, variations of the preceding circuits can be readily fabricated totally on a single integrated circuit chip, with the exception of the LED s, in particular, by means of dielectric isolation technology. An integrated circuit IC employing the LEDS s, as well, is compatible with present knowledge of processing techniques, but is not yet economically feasible. Such a chip for example could be produced having all elements fabricated with Gallum Arsenide rather than having the diode and FET s processed with silicon as is currently the practice. A major consideration in activating the photovoltaic array is that the maximum output current can be no greater than the current generated by the least illuminated diode in the series array. In a straightforward matrix of series connected diodes, such as depicted in Fig. 9, the diode farthest from the LED becomes a limiting factor. For comparable diode efficiency comparable diode impedance in the illuminated state , the diode area should be larger as its distance from the LED increases. The optimized configuration, then, for a series string of photovoltaic diodes is the wagon wheel configuration shown in Fig. 10A, with the LED mounted centrally so as to illuminate all the diodes equally.Fig. lOB shows the circuit of the configuration ofFig. 10A, Ro being the series equivalent resistance of the array. The wagon wheel surface geometry, coupled with the hemispherical refractive film, shown in Fig. 10C, provides maximum response to the LED hemispherical radiation pattern across the entire surface of each diode. Fig. 11 depicts such a circuit, capable of switching AC or DC, in which the switching elements are depletion mode V MOS chips. Bias resistors R l and R 2 are selected to be above 5 megohm. The result is that when diode arrays or photovoltaic generatorsDV 1 or DV 2 are activated, turnoff is rapid because of minimum shunt resistance. Turn on is slower because of the slow discharge of MOSFET gate capacitance through the large bias resistor value. In the circuit shown, LED L 1 is normally on, thereby maintaining Q 2 and 0 2 in an OFF condition.When a control signal is applied to terminal 1, Q 1 becomes saturated, thereby shunting current around L l.Base current to Q 1 passes through L 2, thereby rapidly turning off Q 4 and Q 5 before 4 2 and Q 3 turn on. When the control signal is removed, L 1 initiates rapid turn off of Q 2 and Q 3 before Q 4 and Q 5 turn on. Fig. 11A shows the equivalent circuit for such a physical circuit as is shown in Fig. 11.
