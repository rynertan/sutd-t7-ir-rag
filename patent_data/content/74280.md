# RECOVERABLE CLOSURE

## Abstract
A substrate 4 enclosed for environmental or other protection by a sheet 1 of plain, preferably recoverable, material. The sheet 1 is wrapped around the substrate 4 and closed by a method which allows the diameter of the resulting sleeve to be chosen at will so that the sheet can be cut to length in the field. The method involves the following steps i wrapping a plain sheet 1 around the substrate 4 ii placing a first support 4 within the resulting sleeve adjacent at least a first edge portion of the sleeve and iii either placing a first fastening means over the support 4 so as frictionally to engage opposing edge portions 3 of the sheet 1 therebetween, or placing a second support within the sleeve spaced along the sleeve from the first support and frictionally engaging respective edge portions of the sleeve between respective first and second supports plus fastening means and securing the first fasten ing means and support relative to the second fastening means and support.
