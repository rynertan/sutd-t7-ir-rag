## Description
Microbiological Process This invention relates to novel vaccines containing inactivated toxins. Many diseases in humans and animals are the result of toxin production by pathogenic bacteria, the toxins disrupting the normal cellular activity.The body does, however, have a defence system in the form of the immune response, whereby antibody molecules are produced in response to the introduction of antigenic proteins, e.g. bacterial toxins or proteins present on the exterior of the bacteria themselves. A specific antibody is produced in response to the antigenic determinants of the protein, and may persist in the blood for some time. Therefore, if the antigenic protein should later appear in the blood or lymph, the antibody forming cells that were primed by a previous exposure to the antigen rapidly produce specific antibodies to eliminate it. This concept is the basis of many vaccination techniques, whereby a small quantity of a relatively harmless form of the antigen itself is administered to condition the cells to produce the required antibody. Pathogenic bacteria themselves are not usually suitable for use in a vaccine because they have the potential to cause disease. The pathogen itself therefore is normally killed, e.g. by heating, so that full scale infection cannot occur. In view of the necessity to kill all the bacteria, a high degree of quality control is necessitated in manufacturing the vaccine. This system also requires growth of large amounts of pathogenic bacteria, which are potential infectants of those involved in vaccine production, and care must also be taken to ensure that live pathogens do not escape to the surrounding environment. Furthermore, chemically or physically inactivated bacterial vaccines may not afford the same degree of protection as live pathogens or their toxins themselves. If toxins are used, they too must be inactivated, generally by use of formaldehyde, to yield toxoids .Again, the problem of quality control arises, since the existence of unmodified toxins in the vaccine may lead to severe illness and possibly death. The present invention provides a new approach to vaccination using the techniques of recombinantDNA technology. We have found that it is possible to modify the gene coding for a toxin or a toxic component of a toxin in such a way that when incorporatec into a suitable vector, if necessary together with other genetic material, and used to transform a organism, it produces a toxoid, i.e. a modified toxin which is capable of stimulating production of antibodies active against the natural toxin or toxic component of the toxin, while no longer being toxic. The genetically modified toxin so produced may then be incorporated into a vaccine alone or with other antigens or in the form of transformed non pathogenic host organisms containing the modified toxin. According to the present invention therefore there is provided a toxoid comprising an inactivated form of a toxin or toxic component of a toxin, which inactivated form is substantially homologous with said toxin or toxic component, is produced by expression of a modified gene and is substantially non toxic while being, alone or in combination with one or more non toxic components, capable of stimulating the production of antibodies against the said toxin or toxic component of the toxin. As indicated above, the inactivated toxin or component is substantially homologous with the natural toxin or component, that is it preferably differs only by a small number, for example less than 10, preferably less than 5 e.g. 1 or 2, amino acid residues at or close to a site necessary for toxic activity. It is particularly preferred that this inactive form of the toxin or toxic component conserves the spatial relationship between the amino acid residues which are common to both the active toxin or toxic component and the said inactive form, so that toxic activity is removed while retaining as much as possible of the original immunogenicity. According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a method of inactivation of a toxin or toxic component of a toxin wherein a gene coding for the toxin or a toxic component of the toxin is modified in such a way that when the modified gene, if necessary with other genes, is incorporated into a vector capable of replication in a host organism, and used to transform said host organism it produces a toxoid according to the invention as defined above. The invention also extends to a gene modified to code for an inactivated toxin or component of a toxin according to the invention. Such a gene is preferably substantially homologous with the gene coding for the natural toxin or toxic component.The invention also includes vectors such as plasmids containing such modified genes. There are two mutagenic techniques which may advantageously be employed to modify a gene coding for a toxin causative of a particular disease.The first employs random mutagenesis, for example using a chemical mutagen or irradiation. The randomly modified genes so obtained are then screened for those producing a modified toxin having the desired properties. The second approach involves site directed mutagenesis by modifying the region of the gene coding for a site in the corresponding protein necessary for toxic activity i.e. active region .This may be achieved for example by introduction of an oligonucleotide, conveniently a chemically synthesised oligonucleotide, at that position, so that the gene codes for a closely related, substantially homologous, protein which no longer has a toxic effect, but still gives rises to antibody production. According to one embodiment of this technique where there is an available restriction endonuclease which will cut the gene at a point in the active region, it is possible to insert an oligonucleotide at that point to produce a gene coding for a slightly larger protein having the desired properties. Where the nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for an active region of the protein has been determined and if it contains two restriction sites the opportunity also exists for removal of the sequence between the two sites and either joining the cut ends so formed or inserting a selected oligonucleotide differing only slightly from the sequence removed. In the latter case, the oligonucleotide may be larger or smaller than the removed sequence and or differ at one or more positions. Another method of site directed mutagenesis is primer directed mutagenesis, using a single stranded DNA template. In this method the nucleotide sequence of at least the part of the gene coding for the active region of the toxin has to be determined.A single stranded form of the gene is obtained either by strand separation or by cloning into single stranded phage. An oligonucleotide usually 14 20 nucleotides in length can be synthesised that has a sequence that is complementary to the active region of the gene. This oligonucleotide can be used to prime the synthesis of the entire complementary strand using the single stranded material as a template. This method of introducing a mutation relies on the structure of the oligonucleotide primer. If the oligonucleotide primer is made in such a way as to be complementary to a given region of the gene but with a small variation, preferably a single mismatch in the base to be altered, then this molecule will act as a primer to direct the synthesis of the second strand.The duplex of DNA so formed will have two strands which are complementary except at the point into which the specific mutation has been directed.More than one mismatch may be present but the oligonucleotide primer must be sufficiently homologous with the natural active site to permit synthesis of the complementary strand. It will be appreciated that the replication of this molecule will yield two heterologous double stranded DNA molecules differing in a single base pairing. The modifiedDNA may for example be detected and isolated using a labelled form of the oligonucleotide primer as a probe since it will bind more strongly to the modified than to the unmodified DNA. It will be appreciated that in all such specific mutations, the new oligonucleotide sequence must maintain the reading frame and must not contain undesirable codons such as stop codons. Many gastro enteric diseases caused by gramnegative bacteria are characterised by acute diarrhoea, which is commonly the result of toxin production leading to a disruption of fluid balance within the gut. Scours is an example of such a disease in pigs and cattle, causing acute diarrhoea especially in young animals, while cholera is a particularly notable example of a similar disease in humans.The disease is commonly the result of contamination and colonisation of the small intestine by enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli in the case of scours and Vibrio cholerae in the case of cholera. It has been shown that colonisation of the small intestine by bacteria is initiated by bacterial attachment to the host intestinal wall via an antigenic protein located on the bacterial cell surface, for example the so called K88 antigen in the case of pig scours and K99 antigen in the case of cattle scours. Many previous approaches to vaccination against diseases causing acute diarrhoea have involved development of antibodies against these surface antigens, but these approaches have not employed inactivation of the bacterial toxins. The present invention relates to development of a vaccine which stimulates antibody formation against a toxin which is reponsible for the acute diarrhoea produced hy the infection. In cholera this is normally termed CT while in pig scours a related heat labile toxin LT is responsible for acute diarrhoea and high mortality. In the case of pig scours the LT toxin is composed of two proteins, LTA and LTB, in a ratio of 1 5, which have different functions. The LTB protein which is situated externally binds the toxin to the intestinal wall and then the LTA protein, which is surrounded by the LTB protein, is secreted and penetrates the epithelial membrane of the gut where it stimulates the activity of adenyl cyclase.This enzyme stimulation leads directly to fluid secretion into the gut and to the development of severe diarrohea. Similarly, cholera toxin comprises components CTA, which is responsible for adenyl cyclase stimulation, and CTB, which binds the toxin to the intestinal wall. Previous investigations into protection against pig scours and similar diseases have, in addition to concentrating on bacterial adhesion factors, focused on vaccines containing only the external non toxic protein component of the toxin, e.g.the above LTB protein. However, it is believed that a vaccine containing both LTA and LTB is more immunogenic than one containing the LTB component alone since in studies involving protection of dogs against cholera toxin, the CTB component, analogous to LTB, has been shown to be forty times less efficient than whole CT in providing protection. It has also been proposed EPA 0087735 to modify the LTA toxin by removing a large part of the molecule, e.g. about one third of its length, in order to remove its toxic activity, while retaining some of its immunological properties. However, the modified toxin so formed is not capable of combination with LTB to form a modified LT toxin and inevitably loses many of the antigenic determinants responsible for the immunounimological properties of the toxin. We have found that it is preferable to adopt a different approach, namely that set out above whereby the toxin is changed as little as possible and remains substantially homologous with the natural LTA toxin, thus retaining virtually all the antigenic determinants of the original molecule. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a toxoid comprising a genetically modified form of the toxic component of a toxin causing acute diarrhoea which is substantially homologous with the toxic component and is substantially non toxic but, either alone or in combination with a further non toxic component stimulates the production of antibodies active against the natural toxin or toxic component. The invention further provides a method of altering a gene coding for such a toxic component in such a way that it codes for a toxoid as defined above. The production of the modified toxic component necessitates isolation of the gene coding for that component hereinafter called the A gene normally associated with a gene coding for the non toxic component of the toxin hereinafter called theB gene . The gene may be located in a plasmid, e.g. in the case of pig scours, P307, which may be isolated from E.coli NCIB 11932. The gene modification process cannot conveniently be carried out on the original plasmid in view of its size and lack of recognition characteristics. The selection of clones containing the modified gene is facilitated if it is isolated and inserted into a more suitable vector. Thus, in the case of pig scours, the original plasmid P307 may be digested with EcoRl and Hpal and the digested fragments mixed with the specially developed plasmid pAT153 described hereinafter which has previously been digested to completion with EcoRl and partially digested with HincII and ligated. The hybrid plasmids so formed may be used to transform a suitable host organism, such as E.coli NCIB 11933. The successful transformants may be selected on the basis of production of LTA protein and the plasmids may be isolated by gel electrophoresis. In this way we have been able to identify the transformant containing plasmidGpELTA 6 coding for LTA protein. The B gene may conveniently also be isolated and inserted into a plasmid to enable expression of the LTB component of the toxin. In the case of pig scours the plasmid P307 may be digested with Hind III and the digested fragments mixed with plasmid pAT153 which has previously been digested with Hind III followed by dephosphorylation and ligated. Transformation of E. coli NCIB 11933 and cloning produce one or more transformants producingLTB protein and the responsible plasmid may be analysed by gel electrophoresis. In this way, we have identified plasmid GpELTB 10 coding forLTB protein. The next step is to modify the A gene so that the protein product is non toxic whilst still capable of stimulating production of antibodies.It is also desirable that the protein product should associate with the B component as in the natural toxin upon expression of the modified A gene in conjunction with the B gene. We have applied the strategies mentioned above to produce such genes. The first technique thus involves modification of the A gene by treatment of the plasmid containing the inserted A gene, for example the GpELTA 6 plasmid, conveniently with a mutagen, for example hydroxylamine or a bisulphite e.g. sodium or potassium bisulphite .The mutagenised plasmid is then used to transform a non pathogenic E.coli strain such as strain NCIB 11933. Transformants may then be selected on the basis of the ability of their cell free extracts to produce a protein product that will, upon expression in conjunction with the B gene, give a non toxic immunogenic protein of a similar molecular weight to the natural toxin. In order to produce a modified toxin containing both A and B components, the separate plasmids containing the A and B genes may be cut e.g. by a restriction enyzme such as EcoRI, and joined to produce a hybrid plasmid. Thus, we have joined plasmids GpELTA 6ml, 6m2 and 6m3 respectively to plasmid GpELTB 10 following digestion by Eco R1, and used the three resulting hybrid plasmid to transform E. coli NCIB 11933. The three new plasmids were characterised by genetic mapping and namedGpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2 and GpENT 2m3. In addition, the original GpELTA 6 plasmid was joined to the same fragment from GpELvB 10 to produce the plasmid GpENT 2.After cloning the three transformed strains of NCIB 11933, the modified toxins were then isolated and found to consist of LTA and LTB in a ratio of 1 5 in all cases, identical to the ratio found in the natural LT toxin. Using the same technique we have prepared further plasmids containing modified LTA genes, both with and without the gene for the LTB toxin component. Following the above nomenclature these have been termed GpENT 2m4 to GpENT 2mll and GpELTA6m4 to GpELTA 6mll respectively. The gene sequence of the natural LTA gene hereinbefore described is shown is Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The modifications present in GpENT 2ml to GpENT 2mll, described above have been ascertained and are shown in Table 1 together with corresponding amino acid sequences.

As mentioned above, the second strategy for inactivation of the gene, in this case the A gene, involves specific mutagenesis using a defined oligonucleotide to modify the site coding for the sect ion of the A component of the toxin responsible for toxic activity. This modification of the DNA sequence results in a protein altered in a region necessary for toxic activity. It is, of course, preferable to find a restriction site in or sufficiently close to the sequence of the gene coding for that region.A suitable restriction endonuclease can be found by experiment if necessary plasmids may have to be specially chosen which do not possess sites recognised by this particular restriction enzyme. The oligonucleotide insert desirably contains a recognition site facilitating selection of clones containing the modified gene. This may conveniently be a restriction site not occuring elsewhere in the plasmid modified and unmodified plasmids can then be distinguished by treatment with the restriction enzyme and subjecting the products to gel electrophoresi to distinguish linear from circular DNA. The oligonucleotide must be chosen so as to maintain the reading frame and must not contain a stop codon.It is convenient to produce the oligonucleotide containing such a site by chemical synthesis since relatively short sequences are effective. However, if a naturally occuring sequence having the required properties exists this could be used. The synthetic oligonucleotide may be prepared, for example, using the established phosphotriester procedure of M.Gait et al Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Gene fragments, Ed. H.G. Gassen andA. Long Verlag Chemie Weinheim 1982 . It is preferred to use a short oligonucleotide, for example one coding for 3 to 5 amino acids. When using the pAT153 plasmid, one possible unique recognition site is one recognising the restriction endonucleaseSst II. It will be appreciated that the oligonucleotide s should be complimentary in such a way that they form dimers having adhesive termini corresponding to the cut ends of the gene into which they are to be inserted. Thus for example, we have synthesised the oligonucleotide d CTAGTCCGCGGA which forms the dimer 5 CTAGTCCGCGGA AGGCGCCTGATC 5 We were able to cut the plasmid GpELTA 6 usingXba 1 and insert the above synthetic oligonucleotide d CTAGTCCGCGGA phosphorylated at the 5 terminus.The modified plasmid was then used to transformE.coli NCIB 11933 and cloned. The analysis of the plasmid oligonucleotide hybrids showed that there were a number of mutants which had lost the sequence of DNA recognised by Xba 1, and gained a site recognised by Sst II, implying successful insertion of the oligonucleotide at this site.These mutants were analysed by the Zubay in vitro transcription translation system. This showed that seven of the mutants GpELTA 6s 1 7 produced proteins coded by the modified LTA genes. The next step involved construction of a plasmid coding for the complete toxoid. This was carried out as described earlier, by inserting the LTB gene derived from GpELTB 10 into one of the plasmids containing the insertion inactivatedLTA, for example GpELTA 6s5. A new plasmid was formed, GpENT 2s5. In order to test the protein product of the newly generated GpENT 2s5, cell free extracts of bacterial strains transformed by GpENT 2 containing the natural LTA and LTB genes and GpENT 2s5 contained the natural LTB gene and the modified LTA gene were tested for activity in the rabbit ileal loop.It was found that there was no response to GpENT2s5, showing the protein product was inactive.It can therefore be concluded that oligonucleotide insertion at the Xba 1 site of the LTA gene results in the production of a new, slightly larger, protein, which is no longer toxic. We have also produced an LT toxoid by primerdirected oligonucleotide mutagenesis based, as described above, on the construction of an oligonucleotide complimentary to a given region of theLTA gene but with a slight modification, this oligonucleotide then acting as a primer to direct synthesis of a complimentary strand which is altered so as to code for an inactive LTA peptide. The synthetic oligonucleotide may be constructed as above. We have, for example, synthesised the oligonucleotide TGTTTTCACTTCTCTTAG which differs by only one base from the oligonucleotide TGTTTCCACTTCTCTTAG present in the native gene. This synthetic oligonucleotide may then be phosphorylated and used to prime single strandedDNA which carries the complimentary strand of the LTA gene. The DNA vector used is one which is capable of existing in single stranded form, as a phage, while being able to replicate as a double stranded form in a host bacterium. One example of such a vector is M13mplO. We have thus initially prepared an M13mplO LTA hybrid vector by digesting M13mp10 with Eco R1 and Xba 1, using these same endoncleases to digest GpELTA 6, and then ligating the two fragments together. The hybrid may be identified following transformation into an E.coli, e.g. JM103. An E.coli containing this hybrid may then be used to produce phage particles which contain the hybrid in single stranded form.The primer oligonucleotide may then be annealed to the single stranded template and used to generate a second strand using the action of DNA polymerase. This double stranded molecule is then ligated and cloned into a suitable host organism, e.g. E.coli JM103. On replication of this double stranded DNA, two heterologous double stranded DNA molecules are produced, one of which codes for the natural toxin while the other codes for the toxoid. Cells containing the modified gene encoding for the toxoid may then be identified. The modified genes produced by the above techniques may be used to produce the desired toxoid by incorporation into suitable plasmids as discussed above. In this way we have prepared the plasmidGpENT3SDMl containing the gene modified as above.The plasmid may then be used to transform appropriate host cells, such as E.coli NCIB 11933, which may then be subjected to conventional fermentation techniques and the toxoid isolated. Thus, for example, the transformed host cells may be cultured by fermentation on or in a nutrient medium therefor, which will normally contain a source of nitrogen, such as a protein hydrolysate, e.g. peptone, or one or more ammonium salts a source of carbon and energy such as Lab lemco or glycerol, and trace elements. In the case of E.coli, submerged aerobic fermentation is preferred, advantageously at about 370C. The toxoid may be isolated from the fermentation in any convenient way. In general, the transformed host cells will not be capable of expressing the toxoid extracellularly. Consequently, the cells will normally be collected, e.g. by centrifugation and disrupted, e.g. by sonication or lysis, and the extract, after removal of cell debris, subjected to fractionation, for example fractional precipitation or chromatography. Thus, for example, LT toxoid may be purified by application of such a cell free extract to an agarose column and elution with galactose in TEAN 50mM Tris HCl 50mM EDTA, 200mM NaCl, 3mM sodium azide, pH 7.5 . If required, the toxoid may be lyophilised for storage, prior to incorporation into a vaccine formulation. In general, it is preferred to modify the gene so as to produce modifications between nucleotide residues Nos. 229 corresponding to the start of the DNA triplet coding for Tyr and 459 corresponding to the end of the DNA coding for Val . The LTA protein is thus preferably modified between amino acids 77 Tyr and 153 Val . It will be appreciated that the degeneracy of the genetic code allows more than one coding triplet to code for a particular amino acid, and the invention extends to all genes equivalent to those shown in Figure 1 according to the well known rules of degeneracy. The Genetic Code, Cold SpringHarbor Symp. Quant. Biol., vol 31, 1966 . Therefore, according to a further aspect of the invention we provide modified genes coding for the LTA toxoid according to the invention and, more particularly, genes modified as shown in Figure 1 and their equivalents. The invention extends to a gene.coding for the LTA subunit of LT toxin causative of pig scours wherein the nucleotide triplet coding for serine at position No. 79 is replaced by a triplet coding for phenylalanine and up to two further triplets are replaced by triplets coding for different amino acids. The invention also extends to vectors containing such modified genes. In the case of LTA genes, these are preferably present in a plasmid in conjunction with a gene coding for the LTB protein and in general where a gene coding for a toxic component of a toxin causing acute diarrhoea is concerned, it is preferably present in a plasmid together with a gene coding for the remainder of the toxin theB gene so that a complete toxoid is expressed.Particularly preferred plasmids are those derived from pAT153, especially GpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2 andGpENT 2m3. The invention also extends to host cells transformed with such plasmids, especially E.coli cells such as NCIB 11933. Where the cells are to be incorporated into a vaccine it is important that they should not only be non pathogenic but that they should not generate pyrogens. E.coliNCIB 11933 cells are suitable for this purpose. A further aspect of this invention relates to vaccine preparations containing a toxoid according to the invention. Such a toxoid may be present in purified or partially purified form or may be contained in a non pathogenic host cell which has been used to produce it. We particularly provide a vaccine against scours disease containing the complete toxoid hereinbefore described, wherein the modified LTA component is combined with theLTB component in the 1 5 ratio found in the natural toxin, which may be present, as indicated above, in non pathogenic host cells or in purified or partially purified form. The vaccine used against pig scouring may desirably incorporate non pathogenic host cells containing the toxoid or purified or partially purified toxoid, together with whole bacteria containingK88 antigens or purified or partially purifiedK88 antigens. Plasmids coding for the K88 antigens used, namely K88 types ab, ac and ad, and transformed cells containing them have been described, for example, in EP. 0060129. Corresponding adhesion factors, such as K99 in the case of cattle scours, may suitably be substituted for K88 antigens to produce a vaccine effective against related diseases. Where it is desired to use isolated K88 antigens these can be recovered after fermentation of host cells containing genes coding for such antigens by the methods described by Stirm et al J. Bacteriol. 1967 93, 731 739 . Heat treatment of the cells, isoelectric precipitation and membrane filtration are particularly useful techniques in their recovery.Where a proportion or all of the antigens are released into the culture fluid, either as a consequence of the fermentation conditions, or by heating the fermentation broth at the end of the fermentation, the cell free antigen can be separated from the cells by conventional means, such as centrifugation, filtration or ultrafiltration. The antigens can subsequently be recovered by the methods described by Stirm et al. The vaccine may be formulated in a suitable adjuvant. Such adjuvants, whose purpose is to potentiate the immune response, include, for example, gel forming aluminium compounds e.g. aluminium, hydroxide or aluminium phosphate or water in oil emulsions, such as Freund s complete adjuvant or, more preferably, emulsions comprising purified paraffin oil, an oil soluble surfactant, water and a water soluble surfactant, the ratio of oil to water being 3 5 1. The presence of both the toxoid and the cellwall antigen will give rise to antibodies against the bacterial cell wall protein and the complete toxin, so providing a very effective vaccine against scours disease. The vaccines as described should contain an effective amount of antigenic protein in order to prepare a vaccine useful for effective immunisation of the host. In the case of pig scours a unit dosage of the vaccine suitably contains from 2 ug to 10 ug of toxoid based on protein composition per Kg of animal body weight and from 5 ug to 20 ug Kg of each of the K88 antigens. In the case of whole bacteria the vaccine will preferably contain the equivalent weight of whole cells required to produce the dosage of the purified antigens. The vaccines may be administered orally, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. In the case of pig scours vaccine, the vaccine may be administered to pregnant sows in two doses 3 4 and 6 8 weeks before farrowing. The vaccine may also be administered to young animals to prevent scouring. According to a still further aspect of the invention we provide a method for combating a disease caused by a toxin which comprises administering to a human or animal subject an effect dose of a vaccine as described above. The vaccine as described above, or indeed any vaccine prepared using a toxoid as hereinbefore described, has considerable advantages over previously used vaccines, not only in effectiveness since an unattenuated vaccine is being used, but also in safety, since the bacteria used during fermentation of the vaccine may be non pathogenic, and there is no risk of unmodified toxins being present in the administered vaccine.

When an optical density OD 550 of 0.6 was attained chloramphenicol was added to give a final concentration of 170 ug ml. After a further 17 hr incubation at 370C the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 25 w v sucrose in 50mM Tris HCl, lmM EDTA, pH 8.0. This was put on ice and 6.0 ml of lysozyme solution 5 mg ml in 250mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 was added with gentle mixing. After 5 min incubation on ice, 9.0 ml of 250mM EDTA, pH 8.0, was added again with gentle mixing. After incubation for 5 min on ice, 35 ml of 0.28 v v Triton X 100 in 50mM Tris HCl, 62.5mM EDTA, pH 8.0, was added again with gentle mixing. After incubation for 15 min the lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 g for 20 min the resulting supernatant was collected and retained. To this supernatant was added l lOth volume 5M NaCl and 10 w v polyethylene glycol 4000 to precipitate the DNA.After standing for 4 hr at 40C the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 8.0 ml 50mM Tris HCl, lmM EDTA, pH 8.0. To this was added 7.6 g solid CsC1 and 0.3 ml of ethidium bromide solution 10 mg ml .The mixture was dispensed into two 5 ml quick seal tubes and centrifuged at 250,000 g for 15 hr in a high speed vertical rotor at 15 . The plasmid band was observed by illumination with long wave ultra violet light and removed using needle and syringe.The solution was extracted with isoamyl alcohol until colourless. The solution was then heated at 650 for 15 min to destroy residual nucleases and dialysed against 2 x 100 volumes of lOmM Tris HCl, lOmM NaCl, O.lmM EDTA, pH 8.0 at 40C. After 4hr this dialysis was repeated. Plasmid concentration was determined by measuring the OD260 of the solution. An OD260 value of 1.0 in a path length of 1 cm is equivalent to 50 ug ml of DNA.ii Digestion of pAT153 with Hind III 5 ug of pAT153 was dissolved in 30 ul of reaction buffer final concentration 20mM Tris HCl, lOmM MgC12, lmM DTT, 50mM NaCl, pH7.5 . The enzyme Hind III 5 units ul was added to the reaction mixture 1 unit ug of DNA and this was incubated at 370C. The course of the reaction was followed using agarose gel electrophoresis as follows. 0.7 agarose slab gels 25 x 20 x 0.4 cm were prepared in running bufer 40mM Tris acetate, 2mMEDTA, pH7.8 . 5 ul of running dye 30 glycerol v v , 0.1 w v bromophenol blue in running buffer was added to the DNA sample 0.2 g and made up to a total volume of 25ul with running buffer. The sample was loaded onto the gel which was run for 4 hr at 100 mA. The gel was stained for 30 min in a solution of ethidium bromide 0.5 ug ml , viewed on a transilluminator model C63, U.V. Products and photographed on Type 57 landfilm on a PolaroidMP3 land camera fitted with a 15 and red filters Wratten The digestion mixture was monitored every 2hr as described until digestion of pAT153 by Hind III was complete.iii Dephosphorylation of digested pAT153 2 ug of digested pAT153 12ul were withdawn and 1 unit lul of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added and incubation continued at 370C for 60 minThe mixture was treated with an equal volume of phenol containing 0.1 w v 8 hydroxyquinoline all stored under equilibration buffer consisting of lOmM Tris HCl, 0.2 2 mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 . The aqueous phase was removed and extracted with an equal volume of chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 and finally with an equal volume of chloroform. The DNA was precipitated from aqueous solution by the following procedure. To the DNA solution was added l lOth volume of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.5 followed by 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The solution was mixed well and placed in a dry ice ethanol bath for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 3 min the supernatant was discarded and the DNA pellet dried under vacuum. The precipitate was dissolved in 2 ul of lOmMTris HCl, lOmM NaCl, O.lmM EDTA, pH8.0. This DNA is the vector molecule into which the insert containing the LTB gene will be cloned.iv Large scale plasmid preparation of P307 The method used was as described in A.i except that E.coli NCIB 11932 containing P307 was substituted for E.coli NCIB 11933 containing pAT153. Furthermore, the addition of chloramphenicol to the It culture was omitted the culture being harvested at an OD550 of 2.0.v Digestion of P307 with Hind III The method was as described in A ii except that 10 ug P307 DNA was substituted for Sug pAT153. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated in ethanol as described in A iii . vi Ligation of pAT153 and P307 0.5 ug of cut vector from A iii and 1.5 ug of cut insert from A v were added to 100 ul of ligation mixture containing 50mM Tris HCl, lOmM MgC12, O.lmM ATP, 20mM, DTT, 500 ug ml bovine serum albumin, pR 7.8. The ligation was started by the addition of 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase 1 ul and incubated for 12 hr at 120.vii Bacterial Transformation The DNA mixture derived as described in steps A i vi was used to transform NCIB 11933. An overnight culture of B. coli NCIB 11933 was diluted a hundred fold into fresh L broth 30 ml .This culture was grown with vigorous shaking at 370C.At an OD550 of 0.4 0.5 the culture was cooled in an ice bath for 5 min. The culture was centrifuged at 6,000 g for 5 min and the pellet washed with 20 ml of ice cold 0.15M NaCl and again centrifuged at 6,000 g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of ice cold solution of Cacti2 50mM . After 30 min standing on ice the cells were again pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 3 ml of the Cacao solution. To 0.2 ml of this cell suspension was added 100 ul of the DNA mixture 1 ug in 50mM Cacti2 . Following a further 30 min incubation on ice the suspension was transferred to a waterbath at 430 and incubated for 2 min. The suspension was returned to the ice bath for 20 min and 4.0 ml of L broth was added. The cells were incubated at 370 for 60 min and plated, at serial dilution, onto selective media. The selective medium was L agar L broth containing 1.5 w v agar containing ampicillin at 100 ug ml.viii Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids A small scale plasmid preparation was made of each of the ampicillin resistant transformants as follows 1.0 ml of culture was grown overnight at 370C in L broth. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in 25 ul of 8 w v sucrose, 5 v v Triton X 100 in 50mM Tris HCl, 50mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and mixed well.2ul of lysozyme solution 10 mg ml in 250 mM Tris HC1, pH 8.0 was added and the tube placed in a boiling water bath. After 40 sec the tubes were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant 20 ul was removed and mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol and placed in a dry ice ethanol bath. After 10 min the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet redissolved in 20 ul lOmM Tris HCl, SOmM NaCl, O.lmM EDTA. The DNA was precipitated from the solution using the ethanol precipitation procedure described in A iii . The pellet was resuspended in 20ul of 40mM Tris acetate, 2mM EDTA, pH 7.8 and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis as in Aii . Using this analysis a number of transformants were identified which contained hybrid plasmids i.e.a combination of pAT153 vector plus an inserted fragment derived from P307. ix Assay for LTB Activity The isolated transformants identified in A viii were each grown in 500 ml of L broth to late exponential phase and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min. The pellet was washed in 100 ml 50mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8 and again centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of TEAN. The suspension was sonicated, with cooling in an ice bath, sufficient to rupture 85 95 of the total cells. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 1 hr and the supernatant was stored at 40C until required. Each extract was assayed for LTB activity using a ganglioside immunosorbent assay GM1 ELISA procedure Svennerholm A.M. and J. Holmgren 1978 Curr. Microbial.1, 19 23 . One such extract was found to contain a high level of LTB activity. This activity was encoded by the NCIB 11933 transformant containing the hybrid plasmid GpELTB 10.B Cloning of the LTA Gene into pAT153 The LTA gene was cloned into pAT153 in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 1A i ix . i Digestion of pAT153 with EcoRl and HincII 5 ug of pAT153 was digested to completion with EcoR1 as described in A ii except that the final concentration of the reaction buffer was 20mM Tris HC1, lOmM MgC12, lmM DTT, 100mM NaCl, pH7.5. TheDNA was precipitated from ethanol as in Aiii and resuspended in 30 ul buffer containing 20mM Tris HC1, lOmM MgC12, lmM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, pH7.5. To this was added 0.1 unit of Hinc II to give partial digestion of the above DNA.This was achieved by monitoring the reaction at 30 min intervals by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the time required that resulted in optimum production of molecules only cut in one position by Hine II. The DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in Aiii . ii Digestion of P307 with EcoRl and Hpal lOug of P307 was digested to completion withHpal as described in Aii except that the final concentration of the reaction buffer was 20mM Tris HCl, lOmM MgC12, lmM DTT, pH 7.5. After digestion theDNA was precipitated from ethanol as in Aiii and resuspended in 30 ul buffer containing 20mM Tris HC1, lOmM MgCl2, lmM DTT, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.5. To this was added 10 units of EcoRi and the digestion monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis to completion see A ii . The DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in A iii . iii Ligation of pATl53 and P307 0.5 ug of cut vector pAT153 from B i and 1.5 ug of cut insert from B ii were added to 100 ul of ligation buffer and ligated according to the procedure described in A iv . iv Bacterial Transformation The DNA mixture derived as described in Bi iii was used to transform NCIB 11933. The transformatior procedure was as described in A vii except that the selective medium was L agar containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. The successful tetracycline resistant transformants were each plated onto L agar containing ampicillin at 100 ug ml and those found to be sensitive to ampicillin were tested as follows. v Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids A small scale plasmid preparation was made of each of the tetracycline resistant, ampicillin sensitive transformants as described in A viii . A number of transformants were isolated which contained hybrid plasmids i.e. a combination of pAT153 vector plus an inserted fragment from P307. vi Assay of LTA Activitv Cell free extracts were made of each of the transformants identified in B v according to the method given in A ix . Each extract was assayed for LTA activity by measuring toxin stimulation of adenyl cyclase Tait, R.M., B.R. Booth and P.A. Lambert 1980 Biochem.Biophys. Res. Comun. 96 1024 1031 . One such extract was found to contain a high level of LTA activity.This activity was encoded by the NCIB 11933 transformant containing the hybrid plasmid GpELTA 6. A large scale plasmid preparation of GpELTA 6 was made as described in A i C Isolation of a derivative of Gp ELTA 6 encoding a non active LTA protein. i Chemical Mutagensis of GpELTA 6 The reaction mixture 400 ul contained 6 ug of plasmid GpELTA 6 from B vi in 100mM sodium phosphate, lmM EDTA, 400mM hydroxylamine, pH 6.0. The mixture was incubated at 650C for 4 hr under mineral oil, followed by dialysis against 10 volumes of 50mM CaC12 at 40C. After 4hr this dialysis was repeated. ii Transformation with Mutagenised GpELTA 6 Following hydroxylamine mutagenesis the GpELTA 6DNA was used to transform a culture of NCIB 11933 as described in A vii . The selective medium wasL agar containing 25 ug ml tetracycline. iii Assay of LTA Activity Cell free extracts were made of each of the transformants isolated in C ii and assayed for LTA activity as described in B vi . A number of transformants were isolated that did not produce active LTA. These mutants were analysed further as follows. iv Analysis of Mutants by in Vitro Transcription Translation Large scale plasmid preparations were made from each of the mutants having no LTA activity fromC iii as described in A i . The protein products of the plasmids were analysed using an in vitro transcription translation system Yang H.L., HellerK., Geller M and Zubay G. 1979 Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 75 3304 3308 followed by SDS polyacrylamide 15 gel electrophoresis Laemmli, U.K. 1970 Nature 227, 680 685 . The gel was dried and exposed to a film of Kodak AR5 overnight followed by its development. From the results three mutants were chosen for further analysis. The plasmids from these mutants were each found to encode a protein from the LTA gene that was indistinguishable in size from the native LTA protein. The mutants in NCIB 11933 contained the plasmids designated GpELTA 6ml 6m2 and 6m3. v Determination of Nucleotide Sequence for the LTA Protein and the Three Mutants The LTA gene in GpELTA 6 and the three mutated plasmids GpELTA 6ml, GpELTA 6m2 and GpELTA 6m3 were sequenced using either the dideoxynucleotide method Sanger, F., S. Nicklen and A.R. Coulson 1977 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci USA 74 5463 5467 or the chemical cleavage technique Maxam, A.M. and W. Gilbert. 1977 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 74 560 564 . The sequences and positions of the mutations are shown in Fig. 1.D Construction of Hybrid Plasmid Encoding Whole Toxin Toxoid The hybrid plasmids encoding whole toxin toxoids were constructed in accordance with the teaching of Example A i ix . i Digestion of GpELTA 6 with EcoRl The plasmid GpELTA 6 5 ug from B iv was digested with EcoRl to completion as described inA ii except that the final concentration of the reaction buffer was 20mM Tris HCl, lOmM MgC12, lmMDTT, 100mM NaCl, pH7.5. The digested DNA was dephosphorylated, extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in A iii . ii Digestion of GpELTA 6ml, GpELTA 6m2 and GpELTA 6m3 with EcoRl. A large scale plasmid preparation of each of the plasmids GpELTA 6ml, GpELTA 6m2 and GpELTA 6m3 from C iv was prepared as decribed in A i . Each plasmid was digested with EcoRl, dephosphorylated, extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in D i . iii Digestion of GpELTB l0 with EcoRl A large scale plasmid preparation of GpELTB10 from A ix was made as described in A i . 5ug of this plasmid was digested with EcoRl to completion, extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in D i . iv Ligation of LTB coding fragment with GpELTA 6 and its Derivatives 0.5ug of cut vector, GpELTA 6 from D i or one of each of the three GpELTA 6 mutants from D ii and 1.Sug of cut insert from D iii were added to 100ul of ligation buffer and ligated according to the procedure described in A vi . v Bacterial Transformation Each of the four ligation mixtures from D iv were used to transform NCIB 11932 as described inA vii . The selective medium was L agar containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. vi Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids A small scale plasmid preparation of each of the tetracycline resistant transformants from the four ligation mixtures was made as described inA viii . Using this analysis a number of transformants were identified which contained a hybrid plasmid i.e. a combination of GpELTA 6 or one of its three mutant derivatives and an insert fragment from GpELTB 10, known to encode the LTB gene. vii Assay for LTB Activity As the cloning of the LTB encoding fragment could be in either of two orientations it was necessary to determine that LTB is expressed when cloned into the LTA encoding plasmid. The isolated transformants identified inD vi were each assayed for LTB activity as described in A ix . A transformant from the GpELTA 6 GpELTB 10 plasmid ligation mixture that expressed a high level of activity of LTB was selected. The hybrid plasmid was termed GpENT 2. Similarly, a transformant was isolated from each of the other ligation mixtures that expressed a high level of activity of LTB.These hybrid plasmids were termed GpENT 2ml, GpENT2m2 and GpENT 2m3. viii Purification of LT Toxin Toxoid Cell free extracts were prepared as described in A ix from bacterial strains containing GpENT 2,GpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2 and GpENT 2m3. Each cellfree extract 8 ml was applied onto a column of agarose A 5m 35x1.4 cm equilibrated with TEAN at 40C. TEAN was applied to the column until theOD280 of the effluent had returned to baseline level. The LT, which at this stage was bound to the column, was eluted by the application of 0.2M D galactose in TEAN. The eluted fraction was found to be highly purified for LT usually about 95 and was stored at 40C until further analysis. The purified toxin, from GpENT 2 and the three toxoids from GpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2 and GpENT2m3 were collected and their gross structure was studied further. ix Structure of Toxin Toxoids The purified toxin toxoids from D viii were analysed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 15 Laemmli U.R. 1970 Nature 227 680 685 .The results show that for the toxin and each of the three toxoids there are two protein components corresponding to the size of LTA and LTB. Furthermore analysis by densitometry tracing shows that theLTA to LTB ratio is the same for the toxin and each of the toxoids. The results show that each of the mutated LTA molecules is capable of associating with theLTB molecules in a manner indistinguishable from the native LTA. This result has further been confirmed by immunoprecipitation of toxin toxoids from cellfree extracts of strains containing GpENT 2, GpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2 and GpENT 2m3 using LTB specific antisera. x Testing in vivo Activity of the Toxin toxoids Cell free extracts of bacterial strains containing GpENT 2, GpENT 2ml, GpENT 2m2, GpENT 2m3 were tested in the rabbit ileal loop test. Evans,D.G., D.J. Evans, Jr. and n.F. Pierce 1973 Infect.Immun. 7 873 880 . It was demonstrated that none of the three mutants had appreciable activity when compared with the natural toxin. In fact it has not been possible to detect toxic activity of any kind from the extract of GpENT 2ml even when used at a 2000 fold excess of the toxin level required to produce a positive response. Using the above technique eight further toxoids were prepared, namely 4 11 as shown in the Table hereinbefore. These too have been shown to lack the toxicity of the natural toxic component.Example 2Production of an LT toxoid by Oligonucleotide Insert ion Inactivation of LTA gene by Oligonucleotide Insertion The presence of the Xbal site in the LTA gene Fig.4 allows for the mutation of the gene by the insertion of a synthethic oligonucleotide at this site. The nucleotide sequence and corresponding protein sequence in this region of LTA is shown in Fig. 7. A synthetic oligonucleotide adaptor, 12 nucleotides in length, is shown in Fig. 7 and in this same figure it can be seen how the insertion of this oligonucleotide results in the 1. changed gene sequence 2. correspondingly altered protein sequence 3. loss of the Xbal site 4. acquisition of an SstII site.A Synthesis of the Oligonucleotide d CTAGTCCGCGGA i Column Drying The polydimethyl acrylamide Rieselguhr support functionalised with 5 dimethoxytrityl N benzoyl2 deoxyadenosine 53.7 mg , in a small glass column was treated with pyridine and stirred briefly to remove any air bubbles.

The pyridine flow was stopped and phenyl isocyanate 0.1ml in pyridine 0.9ml was injected over a period of 5 min and the column then left for 4 min. ii Deprotection and Coupling Reactions The polydimethylacrylamide Rieselguhr support functionalised as above was washed successively with pyridine 5 min flow rate 1 ml min and 1,2dicholoroethane 3min . The dimethoxytrityl group was removed by washing with 10 trichloroacetic acid in 1,2 dichloroethane 3 min . The resin was then washed successvely with dimethylformamide 5 min and pyridine 5 min . The flow was stopped and 5 dimethoxytrityl N isobutyryl 2 deoxyguanosine 3 2 chlorophenyl phosphate triethyl ammonium salt 37.5mug, in pyridine 0.4ml containing 1 mesitylene sulphonyl 3 nitro 1, 2, 4 triazole 45 mg was injected into the column over a period of 3 min and then left for 45 min at RT. The resin was washed successively with pyridine 5 min and then 1,2 dichloroethane 3 min . The dimethoxytrityl group was removed as before by treatment with 508 trichloroacetic acid in 1,2dichloroethane 3 min . The resin was then washed successively with dimethyflormamide 5 min and pyridine 5 min . The next nucleotide 40 umol in pyridine 0.4ml containing i mesitylene sulphonyl 3 nitro 1,2,4 triazole 45mg. was injected via the septum port over a period of 3 min and left at RT 45 min . This procedure was repeated using the appropriate protected nucleotide, namely either 5 dimethoxytrityl N isobutyryl 2 doexyguanosine 3 2 chlorophenyl phosphate triethyl ammonium salt or 5 dimethoxytrityl N benzol 2 deoxycytidine 3 2 chlorophenyl phosphate triethyl ammonium salt or 5 dimethoxytrityl N benzoyl 2 deoxyadenosine3 2 chlorophenyl phosphate triethylammonium salt or 5 dimethOxytritylthymidine 3 2 chlorophenyl phosphate triethylammonium salt until the desired sequence had been assembled. iii Deprotection When the assembly has been completed the resin was washed with pyridine 10 min and 1,2dichloroethane 5 min . The resin was removed from the column and washed with ether 5 x 10 ml . The resin was treated with a solution of syn 2 nitrobenzaldoxime 140 mg in dioxan water 1 1 2 ml containing 1,1,3,3 tetramethylguanidine 0.1 ml . After 18 hr the mixture was filtered, the residue washed with water 2 ml and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in concentrated ammonia solution 5 mL and heated at 600C. After 3 hr, the solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue treated with acetic acid water 4 1 5 ml . After 30 min the solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved in water 3 ml and extracted with diethylether 5 x 10 ml . The aqueous liquors were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue dissolved in water 1.2 ml . iv Purification The crude material was purified by anion exchange HPLC on partisil 10 SAX at 400C using A 0.001M potassium dihydrogen phosphate in formamidewater 6 4 pH 6.3 and a gradient of 0.07 B 0.03 potassium dihydrogen phosphate in formamidewater 6 4 pH 6.3 over a period of 45 min. In a typical preparative run a sample 150 ul of crude oligonucleotide solution was injected.A gradient of 0.70 eluent B was run over a period of 45 min. The eluate after ca 40 min containing the desired material as indicated by a W detector set at 270 nm was collected. The remaining material was purified in a similar manner. The purified material was combined 1Sml and desalted in two portions by passage through a Biogel P2 column void volume 60 ml eluting with ethanol water 1 4 . The eluate at the void volume was combined 40 ml and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water 0.Sml .Yield of d CTAGTCCGCGGA 9 O.D. 260 nm . This material was analysed by reversed phaseHPLC on bondapak and spherisorb S.O.D.S. columns using a 0.1M ammonium acetate at pH 6.3 and a gradient of 0.10 0.1M ammonium acetate in acetonitrilewater 4 1 at pH 6.3 over a period of 25 min.This protocol was not used preparatively as further purification proved unnecessary.B Insertion of Oligonucleotide Adaptor into theXbal Site GpELTA 6 i Phoshorylation of Oligonucleotide Adaptor A 1 ug sample of the synthetic oligonucleotide d CTAGTCCGCGGA from Example 2 A in a total volume of 5 ul 50mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5 was heated to 650C for 5 min. When cooled the DNA solution was added to 50 ul of reaction buffer containing 50mM Tris Hcl, 5mM DTT, O.lmM spermidine, 0.lmM EDTA, 4 mM ATP, pH 7.5. 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase 10 units ul was added to the reaction mixture which was incubated at 370C for 30 min. The mixture was extracted with phenol as described in Example 1 A iii . 1 ul of a solution of tRNA E. coli 10 mg ml was added to the mixture and the DNA precipitated from ethanol as described in Example a. A iii .The precipitate was dissolved in 5 ul 10mM Tris HCl, 0.lmM EDTA, pH 7.5. ii Digestion of GpELTA 6 with Xbal 5 ug of GpELTA 6 was digested to completion with Xbal as described in Example B except that the final concentration of the reaction buffer was 20mM Tris HC1, 10mM Mg C12, lmM DTT, 100mMNacl, pH 7.5. The DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in Example 1 A iii . iii Ligation of GpELTA 6 and the Synthethic Ol igonucleot ide 100 ng 5 ul of the phosphorylated oligonucleotide from B i and 1 ug of the digested GpELTA 6 from B ii were ligated in 100 ul of reaction buffer as described in Example 1 A vi . The mixture was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in Example 1 A iii . The precipitate was resuspended in S ul of l0mM Tris HC1, 0.1mM EDTA, pH 7.5. iv Digestion of GpELTA 6 OligonucleotideHybrid with Sst II The DNA from B iii was digested to completion with Sst II as described in Example 1A ii . The mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G50 column 0.9 x 15 cm equilibrated in 50mM Tris HCl, l0mM Mg Cl2, 20mM DTT, 0.lmM ATP pH 7.8 and the DNA eluting in the void volume was collected in 100 ul. 5 ul of the bovine serum albumin solution 10 mg ml was added followed by 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase 1 ul and incubated for 12 hr at 120C. v Bacterial Transformation The DNA mixture from B iv was used to transformNCIB 11933. The transformation procedure was as described in Example 1 A vii except that the selective medium was L agar containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. vi Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids Small scale plasmid preparations were made of the tetracycline resistant transformants fromB v as described in Example 1 A viii . However, following ethanol preciptation the DNA was resuspended in 60 ul of 20mM Tris HCl, 10mM Mg C12, lmM DTT, 50mM NaC1, pH 7.5. This DNA solution was divided into three aliquots one was treated with 1 unitXba 1 1 unit ul the second with 1 unit Sst LI lunit ul while the third remained untreated.These DNA solutions were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in Example 1 A ii . A transformant was identified that contained hybrid plasmid which had no Xba 1 site but a single Sst II in its place. This plasmid was GpELTA 6s5 and had the oligonucleotide adaptor d CTAGTCCGCGGA inserted into the unique Xbal site in the LTA gene of plasmid GpELTA 6.C Analysis of Toxoid Encoded by the GDELTA 6sS Plasmid i Assay of LTA ActivityA cell free extract was made of the transformant containing Gp ELTA 6sS as described in Example 1 A ix . The extract was assayed for LTA activity as described in Example 1 B vi . The extract was found to lack LTA activity. A large scale preparation of GpELTA 6sS was made as described in Example 1 A i . ii Analysis of GpELTA 6sS by in VitroTranscription Translation GpELTA 6sS was used as a template for the in vitro transcription translation process described in Example 1 C iv . Following SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography it was found that the LTA gene with the oligonucleotide insert in GpELTA 6sS encoded a protein that was larger than LTA by about a molecular weight of 500. This was accounted for by the extra 4 amino acids coded within the inserted oligonucleotide.iii Construction of a Toxoid Encoding Plasmid The method used was as described in Example 1 D i , iii vii except that GpELTA 6sS was substituted for GpELTA 6. A hybrid plasmid was identified that contained both the LTB gene and the LTA gene with the oligucleotide insert. This plasmid wasGpENT 2sS. iv Determination of in Vivo Activity of the Toxoid A cell free extract of NCIB 11933 containingGpENT 2s5 made as described in Example 1 A ix was tested in the rabbit ileal loop test as inExample 1 D x . No measurable toxic activity was observed even when used at a 2000 fold excess of the toxinlevel required to produce a positive response. The bacteria containing the LT toxoid products of Examples 1 and 2 may be freeze dried and stored.Example 3Production of an LT Toxoid by Site Directed Oligonucleotide Mutagenesis A mutant LTA can be constructed by changing the codon TCC encoding a serine at amino acid position 79 for TTC which encodes a phenylalanine.A Construction of an M13mP10 LTA Hybrid PhageDNA i Digestion of M13mplO with EcoRl andXbal S ug of M13mplO was digested to completion with EcoRI and Xbal as described in Example 1 A ii except that the final concentration of reaction buffer was 20m Tris HCl, 10 mM MgC12, lmM DTT, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.5. After digestion the DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as in Example 1 A iii . ii Digestion of GpELTA 6 with EcoR1 andXbal 5 ug of GpELTA 6 from Example 1 B iv was digested to completion with EcoRl and Xbal as described above in A i . iii Ligation of LTA Fragment into M13mp10 0.5 ug of cut vector from A i and 0.5 ug of insert DNA from A ii were added to 100 ul of ligation buffer and ligated according to the procedure described in Example 1 A vi . iv Bacterial Transformation The ligation mixture from A iii was used to transform E.coli as described in Example 1 A vii except that strain JM103 was used as the competent host. The selective medium was L agar contained 0.3mM isopropyl ss D thiogalactopyranoside and 0.03 w v 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl ss D galactoside. After plating the transformants, the plates were overlayed with 3ml of L broth containing 0.7 w v agar previously melted and stored at 500 to which had been added 10 ul of an exponentially growing culture of JM103 OD550 0.7 . A transformation event can be observed by the presence of a viral plaque on the JM103 lawn . These plaques are of two types, blue and colourless, dependent on the reaction with the selective medium constituents. v Analysis of Hybrid Phage Constructs A small scale preparation of extracellular single stranded phage DNA of each colourless plaque was made as follows. The plaque was picked from the plate with a sterile toothpick and added to an exponentially growing culture of JM103 in Lbroth 2ml at an OD550 of approx 0.2. This culture was grown at 370 for 6 7 hr. 1.Sml of culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min. A 20 ul sample of supernatant was mixed with 4 ul of running dye and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in Example 1 A ii . Using this analysis a number of plaques were identified which contained hybrid phage i.e. a combination of M13mplO and the area of the LTA gene between the EcoRl and Xbal restriction sites.One such transformant was designated as M13mplOLTA. The nucleotide sequence of the LTA fragment of this hybrid was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide method described in Example I C v . vi Large Scale Preparation of ExtracellularSingle Stranded Phage DNA of M13mplO LTA A colourless plaque of M13mplO LTA was picked from a plate using a sterile toothpick and added to l0ml of L broth. 10 ul of exponentially growingJM103 OD550 0.7 was added and the culture incubated at 370 for 8 12 hr. l.Sml of culture was pelleted by centrifugation at lO,OOOg for 10 min. The top 0.8ml of supernatant was removed and to this was added 200 ul of a solution containing 20 w v polyethylene glycol, 2.5M NaCl. This mixture was incubated at 200 for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 100 ul of a solution containing 20mM Tris HCl, 50mM NaC1, O.lmM EDTA, pH 7.5.The resulting solution was extracted with phenol and the DNA precipitated from ethanol as described in Example 1 A iii . The DNA was resuspended in 25 ul of a solution containing 20mM Tris HCl, 50mM NaCl, O.lmM EDTA, pH 7.5.B Mutagenesis i Synthesis of the Oligonucleotide d TGTTTTCACTTCTCTTAG The oligonucleotide primer d TGTTTTCACTTCTCTTAG was synthesised, purified and analysed using the methods described in Example 2 A. ii Phosphorylation of Oligonucleotide Primer A 1 ug sample of synthetic primer from B i was phosphorylated as described in Example 2B i . iii Digestion of Extracellular Single StrandM13mplO LTA DNA with Sau3A To eliminate trace levels of double strandedDNA from the material produced in A vi , 5 ug of this DNA was digested to completion with Sau3A as described in Example 1 A ii . After digestion the DNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as in Example 1 A iii . iv Annealing of M13mp10 LTA Template and the Synthetic Oligonucleotide Primer 0.5 ug of Sau 3A digested M13mplO LTA template from B iii and lOng of phosphorylated oligonucleotide primer from B ii were dissolved in 10 ul of a solution containing 20mM Tris Hcl, lOmM MgC12, 50mM NaCl, lmM DTT, pH 7.5 and heated to 550 for 5 min. The reaction mixture was chilled at 230 for 5 min. followed by the addition of 10 ul of a solution containing 20mM Tris HCl, lOmM MgC12, lOmM DTT, lmM dATP, lmM dCTP, lmM dGTP, lmM TTP, lmM ATP, pH 7.5. 5 units of DNA ligase 10 units ul and 2.5 units of Large Fragment DNA polymerase 5 units ul were added to the mixture which was then incubated at 150 for 16 hr. v Bacterial Transformation The ligation mixture from B iv was used to transform JM103 as described in A iv . Transformants were observed as colourless plaques on selective medium. vi Analysis of Transformants Nucleotide sequencing of the extracellular single strand phage DNA from the colourless plaques from B v was determined as described in A v .A plaque was identified in which the codon for amino acid 79 of the LTA gene was TTC, thus encoding a phenylalanine at this position and not TCC encoding serine as in the native protein. This change had been affected by oligonucleotide induced site directed mutagenesis. The mutant with this codon change was designated M13mplO SDMl.C Construction of Toxoid Producing Plasmid i Preparation of MI3mplO SDM1 RF DoubleStrand DNA A colourless plaque of M13mplO SDMl was picked from a plate using a sterile toothpick and added to lOml of L broth. 10 ul of exponentially growing JM103 OD550 0.7 was added and the culture incubated at 370 for 7 hr. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000g for 5 min. and the supernatant discarded.

Following 5 min. incubation at 40 120 ul of 20mM Tris SC1, 50mM NaCl, O.lmM EDTA, pH 7.5 containing 2 v v Triton X 100 was added and the incubation continued a further 10 min.The solution was subjected to centrifugation at 30,000g for 30 min. The supernatant approx. 0.15ml was removed and extracted with phenol and precipitated from ethanol as described in Example 1 A iii . ii Digestion of M13mplO SDMI RF DNA withPstl and EcoRi 5 ug of M13mplO SDMI RF DNA from C i was digested to completion with Pstl and EcoRl as described in Example 1 A ii . iii Digestion of pAT153 with Pstl and EcoR1 5 ug of pAT153 from Example 1 A i was digested to completion wtih Pstl and EcoRI as described in Example 1 A ii . iv Ligation of pAT153 and M13mplO SDMI RF DNA 0.5 ug of cut vector from C iii and 1.5 ug of cut insert from C ii were added to 100 ul of ligation mixture and ligated according to the procedure described in Example 1 A vi . Bacterial Transformation The DNA mixture from C iv was used to transformNCIB 11933 as described in Example 1 A vii . The selective medium was L agar containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. vi Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids A small scale plasmid preparation was made of each of the tetracycline resistant ampicillin sensitive transformants from C v and analysed as described in Example 1 A viii . One such transformant, GpELTA SDMI, was identified as containing the Pstl EcoRl fragment from M13mplO SDMI RF in the Pstl EcoRl sites of pAT153. A large scale plasmid preparation of GpELTA SDMI was made as described in Example 1 A i . vii Elimination of the 58bp HindIII fragment from GpENT 2 A large scale plasmid preparation of GpENT2 from Example 1 D vii was made as described inExample 1 A i . 5 ug of this plasmid was digested with HindIIf to give partial digestion as described in Example 1 B i . 0.5 ug of this cut plasmid was ligated according to the conditions described in Example 1 A iv and used to transform NCIB11933 as described in Example 1 A vii on selectve medium containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. Following analysis by small scale plasmid preparation as described in Example 1 A viii a transformant was identified which had lost the 58bp HindIII fragment and thus the EcoRl site located on it but was otherwise the same as GpENT 2. This plasmid was designated as GpENT 3.A large scale plasmid preparation of GpENT 3 was made as described in Example 1 A i viii Digestion of GpENT 3 with EcoRl andXbal 5 ug of GpENT 3 from C vii was digested with EcoR1 and Xbal as described in Example A i . ix Dephosphorylation of Digested GpENT 3 2 ug of digested GpENT 3 from C viii was dephosphorylated as described in Example 1 A iii . x Digestion of GpELTA SDMI with EcoRl and Xbal 5 ug of GpELTA SDMI from C vi was digested with EcoR1 and Xbal as described in A i . xi Ligation of GpENT 3 and GpELTA SDMI 0.5 ug of dephosphorylated cut vector GpENT3 from ix and 1,5 ug of cut GpELTA SDMI were ligated according to the method described in Example 1A vi . xii Bacterial Transformation The ligation mixture from xi was used to transform NCIB 11933 as described in Example A vii . The selective medium was L agar containing tetracycline at 25 ug ml. xi ii Analysis of Hybrid Plasmids A small scale plasmid preparation was made of each transformant and analysed as described in Example 1 A viii . A number of transformants were identified which had the same molecular weight as GpENT 3. Nucleotide sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide method described in Example 1 C v of one such mutant confirmed that the LTA gene had the same sequence as the native gene except that the codon encoding the amino acid at position 79 had been mutated from TCC to TTC corresponding to a change in the amino acid at this position of a serine to a phenylalanine. The pasmidcarrying this mutation was designated GpENT 3SDMI.D Testing the Site Directed Mutation Derived Toxoid i Assay for LTB Activity The transformant containing GpENT 3SDMI was tested for LTB activity as described in Example 1 A ix and was found to produce LTB. ii Assay for LTA Activity The same transformant was tested for LTA activity as described in Example 1 B vi . No LTA activity was observed. iii Structure of Toxoid The toxoid produced by this transformant was purified as described in Example 1 D viii and analysed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 15 . Laemmli, U.K. 1970 Nature 227 680 685 . The results confirmed that this mutated, inactiveLTA molecule is capable of associating with LTB in a manner indistinguishable from the native LTA. iv Testing in vivo Activity of the Toxoid The toxoid was tested for activity in the rabbit ileal loop test as described in Example 1 D x . No toxic activity was detected using the site directed mutation derived toxoid.Example 4Fermentation for the production of LT toxoidStrain The strain, a genetically engineered derivative of E.coli NCIB 11933 was constructed as described in the previous examples and has been given the nomenclature NCIB 11933 GpENT 2mlInoculum development stages i Ampoule ii Slope iii Shake flask florence flask stage i Ampoules of the freeze dried strain were prepared from a slope and stored at room temperature.ii Slope stage 0.2 ml sterile LPSG or nutrient broth NB medium was added to an ampoule of the bacteria. The contents were asceptically transferred onto nutrient agar NA containing 25 ug ml tetracycline and incubated overnight 16 h at 370C. 5 ml sterile EPSG medium were added to the slope and 0.1 ml portions of this suspension were used to inoculate slopes of NA agar medium containing 25 ug ml tetracycline. The slopes were incubated overnight 16 h at 370 and then stored at 40C for a period not greater than 1 month after which this process was repeated.iii Shake flask Florence flask stage 5 ml sterile LPSG or NB medium was added to a slope and a suspension of the surface growth made. This suspension was then used to inoculate a florence flask. 5 ml of the slope suspension was used to inoculate 400 ml of LPSG or Glycerol Holme medium in a 2 litre florence flask. The flask was incubated overnight 16 24h on a rotary shaker 250 rev min with a 2 throw with the temperature being controlled to 370C.Fermentation Stage The florence flask grown culture was used to supply 400 ml 1 v v of inoculum for the fermentation stage. This was carried out in a 70 L vesel containing 40 litres of LPSG or Glycerol Holme medium which had been sterilized at 1210C for 45 mins. The culture was agitated at a speed of 500 rev min using 3 x 6 bladed, 12 cm diameter turbing impellers. A constant temperature of 370C was maintained and sterile air was supplied at a rate of 40 L min.
