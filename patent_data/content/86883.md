## Description
OSTEOSCOPE FOR CARRYING OUT THE NAILING OF THE FRACTURES The present invention refers to an osteoscope for carrying out the nailing of the fractures which are not in the openithrough endoscopic control. Inspite of recent progress in the therapeutics of fractures electrical stimulation of the bones consolidation, use of functional plasters based on a hydrostatic principle or on a uniform compactness, biocompression principles, control of consolidation through detectors, investigation with bio materials and notwithstanding the increasing distrust towards the efficiency of the metallic osteo synthesis compression plates the intramedullarl nailing of K 1ntacher remains an indiscussed method for treating of diaphysial fractures, especially of those having a cross direction or a short skew one, localized at the level of the third portion of the femur and in lesser cases of the tibia and of the humerus. The intramedullaryfastening with pegs with flexible stems sheaf of Hackental, nails of Ender get day after day a larger diffusion in the treatment of humerus and femur neck fractures. Other fastenings with pegs ulna, radius are more rarely used, but remain valid in the treatment of the forearm bone fracturesssin the case of children. These forms of ostesynthesis of intramedullae type have reached their maximum prestige level now that it is possible to carry them out under closed sky , viz. without opening the fracture focus, I.e. by introducing the nails or pegs from an inlet point placed at a certain distance slipped into1 away from the fractured fragments1 through a radioscopic control The technique called under closed sky1, reduces the risks of infections because it does not expose directly the bone fragments and improves the conditions of consolidation with respect to the direct surgery intervention into the fracture focus thus sparing the periosteum circulation. The intramedulla nailing under closed sky of the diaphysial fractures was described by Gerald KÃ¼ntacher in 1940 but the notable radiation risks involving the surgeons , the ancillary personnel and to a lesser extent the patients themselves let us remind that radiations are accumulative limited the diffusion of the method, till the advances in electronics allowed the putting tn the market of the image intensifiers which allow the radioscopic vision with the help of lower radiations with respect to the conventional X ray tubes. The radiations received by surgical personnel may however border on dangerous limits considering the frequency in the use of intensifiers due to the lower risks involved and to the increase in the number of operations under closed s2r . In principle severe measures of radiological protection should be sufficient for avoiding the radiation risks but the heavy lead aprons and the difficulties connected with a systematic dosimetry make it difficult to respect strictly the radioprotective regulations. In order to expose the action on a human body we report textually some sections dealing with long term effects of radiation of the Treaty of Internal Medicine of Harrison The radiation alters the information system of the somatic and germinal proliferant cells . In this way the tissues which perpetuate the blood, the gastroenteric apparatus, the skin, the crystalline, the gonads and other structures transmit to the progeny a bad and inadecuate information which entails, after a long time, a somatic illness, e.g.cancer, cataracts, degenerations or an unspecified shortening of life. It was possible to measure the degree of leucemia produced through radiations in groups of human beings it is supposed, although not proven, that there is no threshold and that production of leucemia increases with the dose. However the increased exposure of public to the danger derives from the medical application od different types of radiation especially for X ray diagnosis . If the previous assertion is correct , this use of radiations should be responsible for the increase of the chances of leucemia and other diseases. Qhis implies for the ND an extreme caution in effecting radio logical examinations on his patients, unless there exists a clear indication for carrying out a diagnosis. There is no doubt that radiation can produce mutations in genes, which are structures forming the centres of information and transmission for heredity. Not all the mutations are prejudicial, but there are enormous probabilities that the change might be detrimental to the species. Not all the mutations imply immediate effects.The problem consists not only in the probability of an increase in the number of deformed creatures or of creatures evidencing lesions, but also in the probability of changes entailing undesired characteristics, like the shortening of life, the decrease in fertility, the general increase of abysical and mental diseases and also the augmentation of abortions and dead born children. Besides the strictly biological effects, the use of radiations aisdinvoives psychological factors, and also factors connected with working activities and economical ones, which are all to be added to the previous ones,when considering the employing of radioscopic operations as a necessary evil in the field of traumatology and orthopedy . It would be without any doubt a progress to avail ourselves of the method of osteosynthesis in intramedullaryfield thus avoiding risks and drawbacks mentioned hereinbefore. TD this basic scope we conceived an osteoscope through which it is possible to carry out the procedure of nailing the fractures under closed sky through an endoscopic control, which, eis expounded hereinafter Endoscopy as technique for observing different organs of the human body represents today a routine technique in most of world hospitals and has reached a notable degree of technological development with various aprlications, i.e. bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, laparatoscopy, just as some instances. The first stwxctUStes attempts to visualize osteo articular, were made by Takagi 1913 and Bircher 1921 .As a matter of factarthroscopy began to be used in clinical field as from 1970, having then at its disposal the arthroscope of Estenabe, who published with Takeda andIkeuchi the first Atlas of Arthroscopy in 1957. In the last years and according to new optical techniques incorporation of cold light sources, luminous fibres etc. and to miniaturization, the method further advanced and the field of utilization was broadened and reached practically the stage of endoscopic surgery . Today one performs operations with direct vision using special instruments introduced along the endoscopes. Until now and in the domain of traumatology and orthopedy endoscopy was only used for carrying out observations and operating procedures on articulations. The basis of the nailing procedure consists in the utilization of the principles of endoscopy in order to visualize directly the medulla cavity of long bones. From a theoretical viewpoint, the difficulties of the realization of osteoscopy of the intra medullary type consist iin the following The diaphysial cavity is occupied by bony medulla. The medullary cavity has no natural inlet orifice. The bones are rigid structures with curves. These difficulties can be overcome through the design of the osteoscope and the procedure of utilization which is to be recorded. The subject of the invention consists therefore in an osteoscope for the realization of the nailing of bony fractures formed by a semi rigid structure allowing the fitting to the shape of the bone. Inside said semi rigid shell the following basic components are housed A channel for optical fibres for lighting scopes, A channel for optical fibres for visual scopes A channel for drainage A channel for introducing instruments and guiding pegs. To meet the miniaturization requirements and a peculiar use of the osteoscope, some of these channels can be eliminated.For instance a single channel can be used in subsequent stages for draining, sucking and instruments introduction. Dimensions and shape of the osteoscope itself and the relevant channels thereof can vary according to the bone to which it will be applied, The end portion of the osteoscope is equipped with a head element to which the different channels are connected and which connrizes a lens with different characteristics connected in turn with the channel for visual fibres, and lenses for the illuminating channel. Between the arm of the osteoscope or a portion thereof which is being introduced into the bone and the head portion there is an articulated system which allows its mobility. As far as the main axis of the osteoscope, the same is formed by the channels used for the introduction of instruments and guiding pegs It ends with a steering wheel which makes easier the handling. As far as the optical, illuminating, draining and sucking systems are concerned, they leave laterally the axle of the apparatus and end in a box containing mechanisms from which starts the visual device containing connections for sources of cold light, vacuum, and fluid under pressure. The visualising system can be foreseen for its connection with a closed circuit television, permitting the simultaneous observation by the whole surgical team, avoiding in this way the risks of contamination of the apparatus due to the direct contact with the eye. Finally it must be said that the ancillary instrumentation of the osteoscope is composed by a stiff sheath through which the arparatus can be slipped , thus permitting the manipulation of the bony fragments for specific applications, and a guiding peg with moving head, which can be angled with respect to its longitudinal axis for some specific applications. These two basic elements of instrumentation stiff sheath e and guiding peg with moving head can be integrated by an endo scopic spoon for the cleaning of the fracture focus and by a rod or an endoscopic brush. In order to better understand the range of the invention, we enclose a set of drawings with some figures describing visually the osteoscope and its application . On such drawings we have On figure la aschematic view of the osteoscopeJbuilt in accordance with the invention. On figure 2a the use of the osteoscope in a process of intra medullary nailing sunder closed sky with endoscopic control. On the mentioned figures the digital references correspond to the following parts and elements 1. Osteoscope 2. Head piece 3. Arm of the osteoscope 1 4. Collar 5. Main aXiS of the osteoscope 1 6. Steering wheel 7. Case with mechanisms 8. Visor or visual evince 9. Connections 10. Guide 11, Stiff sheath 12. Moving head of the guide 10 13. Main trocanter 14. Visual field 15. Visual fibres 16. Fragments of broken bone 17. Fragments of broken bone By looking at the above mentioned figures and with practical reference to figure la, one can observe the osteoscope 1 itself, formed by a semi rigid shell crossed by channels one for optical fibres, serving for illumination one for visual optical fibres one for drainage one for sucking and one for the introduction of instruments and guiding pegs . The front end portion of the osteoscope 1 is composed by a head 2 equipped in its front part by lenses in connection with the channels containing visual fibres and illuminating ones as well as orifices into which disembogue remaining channels, whilst its back portion is connected with the arm 3 or branch located between the head 2 and the collar 4 , it being planned that such connection can be realized through a system of articulations not appearing on the drawing permitting to the head piece 2 to assume an angular position in regard to the main axis of the apparatus 5 , materialized by the channel used for the introduction of instruments and guiding pegs.The osteoscope is finally completed by a steeting wheel 6 which makes easier its manipulation or handling, whilst in a divergent position with respect to the axis or axle and protruding upwards in backward directionsthere is a case with mechanisms 7 from which the visor 8 is projecting , said case containing the connections 9 for the sources of cold light, of vacuum and of fluid under pressure. The osteoscope 1 is completed with ancillary instruments comprizing. a stiff sheath ii through which the instrument can be slipped , allowing its handling, a guiding peg 10 which ends frontally into the moving head 12 which is articulated in order to allow the angulation of the moving head 12 . In order to illustrate better the use of the above described osteoscope we select as example the nailing of a femur fracture, so that slight modifications may permit its utilization for other long bones, such modifications occurring in technical and instrumental fields. To better clear up the matter and in order to prove the advantages offered by the osteoscope, we shall describe before all the conventional procedure for nailing under closed sky under radioscopic control. The original description by C.K ntscher of the technique of nailing under closed skyn includes many further sections but can be summarized essentially as follows 1 Placing the patient inside an adequate equipment in order to effect the traction of the fracture and to position correctly the image amplifier, thus obtaining radioscopic projections of orthogonal typelmade in sequence, of the fracture focus. 2 Incision on the main trocanter. Perforation and magnification of an orifice on the upper rim thereof, in order to be able to reach the medullary cavity. 3 Introduction through the orifice of a wire guiding into the medullary cavity. 4 Radioscopic control of the correct introduction of the guide inSthe fragment located nearby, 5 Reduction of the fragments of the fracture through external steps. 6 Introduction of the guide inEthe distal fragment of the fracture. 7 Radioscopic control of the proper positioning of the guide through two projections. 8 Magnification of the medullary cavity through the use of flexible grooved miller, evidencing an increasing diameter, lead along the guiding peg. 9 Introduction of the previously selected intra medullary nail. 10 Extraction of the guiding wire. The point of paramount importance of the above quoted procedure is the introduction in a correct way of the wire, which threads both fragments and guides the other instruments of the equipment. We shall now describe the nailing sunder closed sky under endoscopic control , using the osteoscope forming the object of the present invention 1 Preventive ischemia for stopping patient s bleeding.Putting the patient in an adecuate position. i 2 Incision on main trocanter 13 . Perforation with punch of an orifice on the upper rim thereof. Sr 3 Amplifying same through the use of a rasp in the direction of the medullary channel, digging a channel in the spongy trocanter tissue. The outflow through the orifice of blood and drops of grease shows that the medullary cavity has been reached. 4 Cleaning of the medullary cavity through the use of a spoon with long handle or of the medullary brush. 5 Introduction of a probe or sound till the fracture focus. Sucking of the fracture hematoma. 6 Introduction of the stiff sheath 11 of the osteoscope 1 into the proximal fragment. The portion of such a sheath protruding from the operation wound , permits to move the proximal fragment. 7 Progressive introduction of the osteoscope 1 through the sheath 11 , till reaching, under visual control, the fracture focus please observe on figure 2a the visual field 14 corresponding to the shadowed zone, as well as the visual fibres 15 . 8 By handling the sheath 11 the medullary orifice of the distal frag ent is looked for. Washing and sucking the residuals of the hematoma in the fracture focus. The introduction of the endoscopic spoon shall allow more efficiently the cleaning of the coagulated blood or of detrital elements of the tissue which were not moved by pressure washing. 9 Introduction of the guiding peg 10 under direct ,visual control through the osteoscope. The possibilty ing the head 12 of the guide 10 in angular positions facilitates this. The vision through a closed circuit television permits to an assistant to collaborate in the process through an external manipulation in the lining up of the fragments, bearing the numbers 16 17 . 10 Introduction of the osteoscope 1 inithe distal fragment by slipping along the guiding peg. Washing and sucking the intramedullary grease or use of the endoscopic brush if necessary. Going forward of the osteoscope till tubercles of the spongy bone of the distal epiphysis of the femur becomes visible. The length of the introduced osteoscope determines the size of the nail. 11 Extraction of the guiding peg and replacement of same by a conventional guide . Progressive extraction of the osteoscope till it reaches the level of the fracture focus, Endoscopic control of the correct reduction of the fracture. 12 Extraction of the osteoscope. After this the process continues in a conventional way. According to what expounded , the advantages of the osteoscope can be summarized as follows 1. Radioscopic examination appears no longer necessary so that radiation risks are diminished This concerns a The surgeons and the personnel of the operating team, b The patient himself or herself. Under normal con editions radiation absorbed by the patient is not dangerous for t his or her health, but can damage the embryo in case of pregnant women. 2. Permits a tridimensional vision of the fracture focus, whilst the amplifier permits only flat images, This will facilitate the fracture reduction a 3. The sucking of the bony medulla and the emptying of the diaphysis cavity probably diminishes the intra medullary pressure and the risk of fat embolism. 4. The positioning of the patient in the conventional procedure is difficult to achieve and complex, due to the need to be in conditions to turn the tube of the amplifier of images without obstacles or interpositions, in order to obtain orthogonal projections. These drawbacks are avoided by using our procedure and the relevant improvements connected with it. 5. Although the technique was conceived initially for the treatment of diaphysis fractures, it can be applied to other cases like observation of tumours and pathological processes of intra medullary kind or other forms of intra diaphysial surgery.
