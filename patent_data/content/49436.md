# Process for producing highly stereoregular alpha olefin polymers.

## Abstract
A process for producing highly stereoregular α olefin polymers which comprises polymerizing α olefins in the presence of a catalyst system comprising A a solid catalyst obtained by contact reaction between a a solid product prepared by reacting an organo magnesium compound with at least one of halogenated silicon compound I and halogenated aluminum compound, and b a titanium compound having both titanium aryloxy and titanium halogen linkages, and B an organometallic compound of a metal in Groups I to III of the periodic table as an activating agent.
