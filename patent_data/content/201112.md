## Description
DESCRIPTIO The invention relates to an apparatus for automatically replacing the electrode in a welding machine for electric motor rotors.In traditional welding machines used for welding the ends of armature windings to the respective comniutators, the welding operation takes place as follows.The armature is positioned under a welding head, and a device which rotates the armature stepwise through angles equal to the angle between the adjacent commutator hooks to which the armature wires are to be welded then causes the armature to undergo a first zeroing rotation which moves the first commutator hook into a position corresponding with the electrode. In order to facilitate the connection between the wire and the commutator hook, the welding head undergoes a short vertical movement to force the electrode against the hook, thus mechanically deforming it crimping . This operation makes the electric circuit and a high intensity current begins to pass through the tungsten electrode and the earth electrode, thus heating the commutator bar and consequently the wire, to remove its insulating covering and create contact between the wire and commutator hook.The same hot upsetting operation is carried out on each successive hook after rotating the armature through an angle equal to the angle between one hook and the next. During the welding operation, which takes place at the rate of one every 0.8 seconds, the tungsten electrode, by virtue of its mechanical action and the heating which it undergoes, loses sharpness at its tip and thus loses its welding efficiency, and consequently has to be replaced by a sharpened one. This replacement, which may have to be done as often as every two hours of operation, is currently carried out generally by replacing the electrode holding block which is fixed by screws to a support, and this is always done manually.It is therefore apparent that these operations involved in replacing the electrode result in undesirable and too frequent interruptions in the welding machine operating cycle, and also require the presence of an operator who intervenes manually on the machine every two hours in order to replace the electrode by an operation which requires a time which is too long with respect to the machine working rate.The object of the invention is to provide a device for the programnled automatic replacement of worn electrodes, which are repeatedly replaced by sharpened electrodes withdrawn automatically from a magazine in the machine. This concept avoids the need for continuous manual intervention, by limiting it to a single operation when all the magazine electrodes have been used. In addition, the idle times during the replacement of each electrode are considerably reduced in that this is done automatically by the machine without any manual intervention, which would inevitably lead to considerable lengthening of such idle time.These and further objects which will be more apparent hereinafter are attained according to the invention by a machine for welding the ends of the armature winding of an electric motor rotor to the commutator bars, of the type constituted by a welding electrode which can translate repeatedly between a rest position and a welding position for the ends of the winding when the armature is rotated stepwise in order to bring all the ends of its winding into a position corresponding with the electrode and with the armature onto which the electrode welds them, characterised in that the electrode is mounted on a revolving turret provided with further electrodes disposed on its periphery at constant angular distances apart said revolving turret being mobile in order to determine said alternate rest and welding positions of one of its electrodes programmable mechanical means also being provided for rotating the revolving turret through angles equal to the angular distance between two adjacent electrodes, to repeatedly replace a worn electrode with a new one as each electrode completes a predetermined number of welds.The apparatus according to the invention is described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partly sectional side view of a welding machine provided with the automatic electrode replacement device according to the invention Figure 2 is a front view of the automatic replacement device of Figure 1.In a fusion support 10, which supports all the welding head devices, there is slidably mounted a vertical shaft 11 to which the tungsten electrode 12 for welding the wires 13 onto the hooks 14 of the commutator 15 of the armature 9 is connected in the manner described hereinafter. The copper earth electrode 16 is carried by a support 17 to which the current carrying braid and the cooling water piping are connected. As the support 17 is of a type known to the expert of the art, it is not described in terms of its constructional details.According to the invention, a revolving turret 18 in which a plurality of electrodes 12 are inserted is connected to the shaft. These electrodes are cylindrical in the part which enters the turret, and comprise two flat facets on the tip, where contact is made with the co mutator hook. When the electrode is inserted into the turret, it rests on the grub screw 19,wtiich is axially adjusted such that the electrode tip is always at the same distance from the centre of rotation of the turret, and is still the case when the electrode has been sharpened several times. The grub screw 28 serves to retain the electrode axially and to angularly position its two facets. All these operations involving the positioning of the electrodes in the turret are carried out away from the machine on a suitable fixture.The revolving turret 18 rotates about its centre 20 on a shaft 27 securely screwed to the support 17, and has a toothed periphery 21 which engages with a rack 22 rigid with a piston 23 comprising adjustable stops 32 to enable it to undergo a stroke which is exactly equal to the angle between one electrode and the next. Strong contact is attained between the turret 18 and support 17 by virtue of the pressure exerted by an air chamber 25 provided inside the turret. The pressure is obtained in the following manner Air from the compressed air system enters the support 17 through the bore 29, to reach the chamber 25 through the longitudinal and transverse bore 33 in the shaft 27. The turret is thrust against the support 17 by the reaction against the disc 31, provided with suitable seals 35, which rests against the ring nut 30 which is screwed onto the shaft 27. The ring nut 30 can be unscrewed manually when the entire turret is to be replaced. The shaft 11 is connected to the support 17 by four screws 34.When in the position shown in Figures 1 and 2, the electrode 12 facing the armature 9 is ready to make the weld. The shaft 11 is now driven downwards to cause the electrodes 12 and 16 to weld the wire 13 onto the hook 14. During this stage, the support 26 for the piston 23 and rack 22 remains fixed as it is rigid with the support 10. In contrast, the turret 18, which is rigid with the mobile support 17 and consequently with the shaft 11, translates with this latter. The toothed wheel 21 disengages from the rack 22, and the electrode 12 facing the armature 9 makes the weld.The number of welds which an electrode can make before becoming worn will have already been set on the machine electronic control system, and thus the electrode will repeatedly weld, at the rate determined by the control system, all the wires of the armature rotating stepwise below it through angles equal to the angular distances between its hooks 14, followed by all those of all the other armatures 9 which alternate automatically below the electrode, until the number of welds for which that electrode has been programmed is reached. At this point, the machine stops, discharges the last completed armature without loading others into it, and begins the electrode replacement operation in accordance with the following stages.At the commencement of the replacement operation for the electrode 12, the mobile shaft 11 is in its raised position, and the rack 22, which engages with the toothed wheel 21 of the revolving turret 18, is in the position shown in Figure 2, ie to the right when viewing the machine face. The pressure is removed from the air chamber 25 to release the turret 18 from its engagement against the support 17, and the piston 23 is moved to the left shown by dashed lines inFigure 2 to cause the turret to undergo one indexing movement, ie a rotation equal to the angular distance between two adjacent electrodes 12. A new electrode 12 will therefore lie in the position previously occupied by the worn electrode.Pressure is again applied to the air chamber 25, to restore the rigid connection between the turret 18 and support 17, and the mobile shaft 11 is then driven downwards to drag the turret 18, so releasing its toothed wheel 21 from its engagement with the rack 22. The piston 23 is reset, ie it again moves the rack 22 to the right shown by full lines in Figure 2 , to again attain the waiting position for the next electrode replacement. The shaft 11 finally returns to its raised position for commencing the new weld, which is made when a new armature 9 has been fed into the position of Figure 1. These electrode replacement operations are repeated exactly as heretofore described until the electrodes in the turret have all become vorn, after which the machine is stopped so that the operator can manually replace the turret with another containing new electrodes pre positioned in a manner similar to the preceding.
