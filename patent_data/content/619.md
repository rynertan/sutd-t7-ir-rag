# Liquid dielectric composition.

## Abstract
A liquid dielectric composition obtained as a result of a process which comprises reacting benzene with ethylene in the presence of an alkylation catalyst to obtain an alkylation product containing largely unreacted benzene, ethylbenzene, polyethylbenzenes, 1,1 diphenylethane and heavier products, separating benzene, ethylbenzene, polyethylbenzenes and 1,1 diphenylethane from said alkylation product and thereafter recovering from said heavier products a fraction having a boiling point in the temperature range of about 275 to about 420 C., preferably about 280 to about 400 C., as said liquid dielectric composition.
