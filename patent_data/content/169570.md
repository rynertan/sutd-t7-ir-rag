# PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF REINFORCED FALSE TWIST YARNS

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of reinforced false twist yarns comprising two conventional acrylic fiber rovings 10,11 led to braking rolls 12,13 by means of a guide 24 and further to pulling rolls 16,17 , whereas these two sets of rolls turn at different speeds, so that the roll situated in the position nearest the input of the respective rovings have a lower speed than the output roll which works as puller. Between the said two sets of rolls there is a pair of drawing bands 14,15 which simultaneously guide and draw the roving to obtain the said yarn.
