# Fastener and method of mounting the same.

## Abstract
A fastener with poygonal rim 40 cooperates with an axially projecting section 24 to define a recess 48 in which sheet material 12 is forced to hold the fastener 10 against rotational and axial movement relative to the sheet material 12 . The gripping action between the fastener 10 and the sheet material 12 is improved first, that the sheet material 12 is stretched by a tool 92 which extends through the center of the fastener 10 , and second by resiliently compres sing the center section 24 of the fastener 10 with the die 34 . The center section 24 springs outwardly to decrease the size of the recess 48 and grip the sheet material 12 . In addition, the rim 40 is resiliently deflected radially outwardly by the die 34 . The holding action between the fastener 10 and the sheet material 12 is increased by providing the recess 48 with identations 84 which project into the rim 40 and center section 24 .
