# ELECTRODE AND OR INTERCONNECTION

## Abstract
An electrode and or interconnection formed by a single crystalline metal or alloy film is disclosed. In comparison with conventional electrodes and or interconnections formed by polycrystalline metal or alloy, the short or open fault of the electrode and or interconnec tion resulting from electromigration is by far less likely to occur. The electrode and or interconnection of the present invention is particularly effective for improving the reliability of miniature electrodes and or interconnections whose line width is up to about 3 Âµm.
