## Description
ItbROVED LOCKING MEANS FOR BASKET STYLE CARRIERS This invention relates to a bottle carrier and in particular to a basket style bottle carrier which is assembled in collapsed condition and which is provided with a special locking feature for maintaining the carton erect and for reducing the amount of outward bowing of the carrier base so that the carrier can sit square, once erected, ready for loading. It is well known for such basket style bottle carriers to incorporate locking means to support the ends of the bottom of the carrier thereby to maintain the carrier in set up condition for loading. Of the more recent examples of the art, U.S. PatentNo. 3,997,051 Graser et al utilizes conventional locking tabs provided at each end of the carton and adapted to engage into adjacent locking notches provided at each end of the bottom panel. It is also known to provide a locking projection which locks into a locking hole provided in the carrier bottom panel spaced inwardly from the end edge thereof. For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,783,916 Hodapp shows such an arrangement where the locking projection and cooperating locking hole are positioned centrally of the carrier base.Furthermore, U.S. Patent No. 3,997,051 previously referred to includes a similar arrangement where the locking projection and cooperating locking hole are positioned centrally of the carrier base and used in combination with conventional end locking tabs and notches. Another type of known construction is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,857,483 Wood in which a locking projection and cooperating locking hole are positioned adjacent one end of the carrier whilst a conventional locking tab and notch are provided at the opposite end of the carrier. The primary need for providing locking means at both ends of a bottle carrier as opposed to one end , regardless of the particular arrangement adopted, is in connection with those carriers suitable for use in the softdrink industry. For economic reasons most soft drink bottle carriers are intended for use with returnable bottles and hence the carriers are re used on a number of occasions.These returnable use carriers are stored in collapsed condition during the off season in the trade. As is well known, the carriers can be collapsed in either of two directions and consequently the paperboard is apt to develop a set or bias, particularly under the influence of ambient moisture, against being erected into a squared up condition. It is therefore extremely desirable to provide for the carrier to be locked at either one of its ends so that it is unnecessary to ensure that collapsing for storage is limited to a particular direction of collapse. In contrast, carriers for use in the beer industry are required for a one time use only. Consequently, there is no necessity to provide locking means at both ends of the carton since the problems arising from collapsed storage do not arise. As a result the vast majority of carton erecting devices are adapted to cause engagement of locking means at only one end of the carton. This normally is achieved by use of the over travel technique in which, during carton set up, the carton end walls are caused to be displaced past their squared up position so that the locking tab can be mated with the cooperating notch by inward pressure applied to the carton base, whereafter the displacement force is relieved so allowing the carton to return to a square set up condition with the locking means engaged. However, there is a marked mbvement in some segments of the beer industry, using in line loading, towards higher bottling and carton line speeds. High speed operation has given rise to a greater necessity to ensure that the carton sits squarely on the line conveyor ready for loading. High speed operation also leads to the problem of some cartons being inadvertently collapsed prior to loading by striking hard against one another and so disengaging the locking means. The known locking arrangements are not able adequately to overcome these problems while at the same time remain suitable for use with standard carrier erecting devices. For compatability with such devices the requirement is for a single carrier lock adjacent one end of the carrier which can be engaged by the over travel technique.Thus the invention seeks to solve the problems relating to high speed bottling operations and which at the same time provides a carton suitable for use with existing machinery. The locking projection and cooperating locking hole arrangement formed on the carrier disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,857,483 is capable of producing a carrier which exhibits adequate stability when set up. However, in order to prevent inadvertent collapse of the carrier, a tab and notch locking means additionally is required at the opposite end of the carrier. This arrangement is necessary since the firstmentioned locking projection is constructed to prevent disengagement from its cooperating locking hole in only one direction. When end force is applied to the carrier in a direction which displaces the engaged peripheral portion of the locking hole outwardly from the throat of the locking projection, it is the opposite end lock which functions to prevent further displacement which would otherwise result in collapse of the carrier. The single locking projection disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 2,783,916 although capable of arresting displacement caused by an end force applied to either end of the carrier, is not shaped nor positioned so as to be suitable for use with normal over travel type erecting devices.The lock disclosed is engaged by causing the projection to be forced through the locking hole. This invention provides a basket style carrier comprising a pair of spaced side walls, a pair of end walls joining the ends of the side walls, a center section extending between the end walls parallel to the side walls, a bottom panel attached to both the side walls and having a locking hole formed therein, and a locking projection depending from the center section for engagement with the locking hole, the locking projection and the locking hole being located intermediate a notional transverse center line of the bottom panel and an end edge thereof when the carrier is in set up condition, said locking projection including a first locking edge which engages a first peripheral edge part of the locking hole adjacent said transverse center line, and a second locking edge which engages an opposed second peripheral edge part of the locking hole remote from said transverse center line, characterized in that the maximum longitudinal dimension of the locking projection is greater than that of the locking hole and in that the distance between said first and second locking edges is substantially equal to the distance between said first and second peripheral edge parts, whereby displacement of the carrier walls and bottom panel relative to said center section is arrested in one direction by engagement between said first locking edge and first peripheral edge part of the locking hole and in the opposite direction by engagement between said second locking edge and second peripheral edge part of the locking hole. For a better understanding of the invention, reference is now made to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a basket style carrier in collapsed condition with portions of one side wall broken away to show the locking projection associated with the interior center section Figure 2 is a view of the underside of the carrier while being erected and showing the bottom panel locking hole posi tioned for engagement with the locking projection andFigure 3 is a view of the underside of the same carrier after the locking operation has been completed. In the drawings, the numeral 1 designates the bottom panel of a basket style carrier, the bottom panel being hinged to one of the carrier side walls 2 and joined to the opposite carrier side wall 3 by means of a glue flap 4 hinged thereto. The bottom panel 1 has a central fold line 5 along which the bottom panel is folded into two overlapping sections when the carrier is in its collapsed condition as shown in Figure 1. As is well known in the art, the carrier has a medial partition or center section 6 extending between the end walls parallel to the side walls. The opposite ends of this center section 6 are preferably hinged to end walls 7 and 8, respectively, and, when the end walls are formed from two abutting panels, may be integral with the interior end edges of such end wall panels. The center section 6 is provided at its lower end with a locking projection A . Locking projection A comprises an inwardly facing toe portion 9, an opposed heel portion 10 and a throat portion 11 located intermediate the toe and heel portions and above said toe portion. In the preferred embodiment, toe portion 9 points in a direction opposite to the direction in which the carrier collapses. The throat portion 11 is formed by a recessed part of the center section 6.The lowermost edge of the center section 6 between the toe and heel portions provides a foot 12 of locking projection A . The length of the foot 12, that is, the length between the extremities of the locking projection A as measured longitudinally of the carrier is designated by reference character b . The internal edge of throat portion 11 which is adjacent heel portion 10 constitutes a first locking edge 13 of the locking projection A . A second locking edge of the locking projection A is provided by the heel portion 10. As shown this second locking edge 10 is stepped up sharply at right angles to the foot 12 and is, in the set up carrier, disposed substantially at right angles to the plane of the bottom panel 1. The distance between the first locking edge 13 and the second locking edge 10 is designated by reference character c . In order to cooperate with the locking projection A so as to maintain the carrier in a squared set up condition, the bottom panel 1 of the carrier is formed with a subs tan tially deltoid locking hole 14. The locking hole 14 is positioned intermediate a notional transverse center line x x Figures 2 and 3 of the carrier and the end edge 15 of bottom panel 1. Preferably the apex 16 of the locking hole 14 faces away from the transverse center line x x , i.e. toward the end edge 15. This orientation of the locking hole gives greater stiffness in the strip of material designated numeral 17 than would be the case if the apex 16 faced away from the end edge 15. The edge 18 opposite the apex of locking hole 14 provides a first peripheral edge part for engagement with the first locking edge 13 of the locking projection A , and the edge 19 at the apex of the locking hole 14 provides a second peripheral edge part for engagement with the second locking edge 10. The distance between the first and second peripheral edge parts is designated by reference character d .Preferably the deltoid locking hole 14 together with the locking projection are located closer to the end wall 8 than to the transverse center line x x . In the embodiment shown, the position of the locking projection is limited by the amount of material available at the lowermost edge of the center section. It is an important aspect of this invention that the dimensional relationships between the locking projection A and locking hole 14 are met. The required relationships to ensure correct and secure locking, allowing of course for accepted manufacturing tolerances, are as follows b d c In other words, the maximum longitudinal dimension of the locking projection A is to be greater than that of the locking hole 14 while the distance between the first and second locking edges is to be substantially equal to the distance between the first and second peripheral edge parts. The locking of the bottom panel 1 to the locking projection A is effected during the setting up procedure of the carrier as follows As the collapsed carrier is expanded by moving side walls 2 and 3 apart from each other, pressure is applied to end wall 7 so that the latter is displaced inwardly somewhat past its squared up position. As best seen in Figure 2, this displacement causes the center section 6 and the locking projection A associated therewith to move relative to the bottom panel 1, so that the edge part 18 of locking hole 14 will clear the end edge of toe portion 9. Inward pressure is then applied to the bottom panel 1 adjacent edge part 18 to cause that portion of the bottom panel 1 to be displaced inwardly past the toe portion 9.Immediately thereafter, the force against end wall 7 is relieved so that the carrier is relaxed whereby locking edge 18 is received in the throat portion 11 such that the first locking edge 13 of locking projection A abuts the first peripheral edge part 18 of locking hole 14. At the same time, the second locking edge 10 of locking projection A is engaged with the second edge part 19 of locking hole 14.Once the loclcing projection and locking hole are mated, the strip of material 17 between apex 16 and bottom panel edge 15 is seated in the U shaped recess 20 formed in the lower edge of the center section 6 Figure 1 between locking edge 10 and the end wall 8. This feature reduces the stress applied to the strip 17 compared to the situation in which the strip is flush with the lowermost edge 21 of end wall 8 and ensures that locking edge part 19 is effectively positioned with respect to the vertical locking edge 10. As a result of the arrangement described above, displacement of the carrier walls and bottom panel relative to the center section is arrested in direction Y by engagement between first locking edge 13 and first peripheral edge part 18 and in the opposite direction Z by engagement between second locking edge 10 and second peripheral edge part 19 Figures 2 and 3 .
