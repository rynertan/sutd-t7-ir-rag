# IMPROVED PARTIALLY FLUID LOCKED DRIVE TRAIN

## Abstract
Improved partial locking for a fluid locked planetary gear train is provided by loosely mounting planet gears 110, 111, 60, 61 for movement within the chambers 100 103 which closely surround the partially locked planet gears. The driving and reaction forces on the loosely mounted planet gears per mit the planet gears to move so that their peripheral ends come into close engagement with the walls of the chambers in which the gears are mounted to further increase the fluid resistance to movement of the gears. To obtain similar partial locking characteristics in either a forward or a reverse direc tion, the planet gear pairs and their corresponding chambers are reversed in their relative positions.
