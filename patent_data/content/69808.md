# Thin sheet heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A thin sheet heat exchanger 8 is provided which facilitates the transfer of heat between two flowing streams of gas 70, 80 . The heat exchanger 8 is formed of a packing of rectangular heat exchange plates 10 positioned by the method of the present invention separately and parallelly to one another. The packing realizes a crossflow channel pattern for the two gas streams 70, 80 . The heat exchange plates 10 which compose the bulk of the heat exchanger 8 are, by the method of the present invention, folded at two opposite sides 17a, 17b . The plates 10 are stacked as prescribed by the method of this invention, and sealed along the folded sides of each pair of consecutive plates 10 , thus forming individual gas channels. Also by the method of the present invention gasket sealing surfaces 25 and flange mounting surfaces are realized by the said folds of the said heat exchange plates 10 . A heat exchanger system can be constituted by a plurality of said heat exchangers assembled, by the method of the invention, to realize a desired combination of flow patterns.
