## Description
Process for the preparation of l isopropylamino 3 4 2 methoxy ethyl phenoxy 2 propanol This invention relates to a new process for the preparation of l isopropylamino 3 4 2 methoxyethyl phenoxy 2 propanol or metoprolol I and the acid addition salts thereof.EMI1.1 Metoprolol is a therapeutically valuable so called 13 adrenergic blocker. Most of the 3 blockers have the drawback of blocking in addition to the 13 receptors of the heart also the 13 receptors of the blood vessels and the lungs. Contrary to this,metoprolol is heart specific and thus an important drug in the therapy of heart diseases.The preparation of metoprolol is known from e.g. the Swedish patent No. 354 851, in which 12 processes for its preparation are described. These processes all relate to methods for the synthesis of the isopropylamino side chain.As starting material in the present invention is used the known and easily prepared sodium salt of 4 methoxyethanoyl phenol it . EMI1.2 This is reduced in the first step to 4 1 hydroxy 2 methoxyethyl phenol III .EMI1.3 By heating a mixture ofthis hydroxyphenol III and methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst 4 1,2 dimethoxyethyl phenol IV is formed. At corresponding conditions in ethanol is formed 4 1 ethoxy 2 methoxyethyl phenol V .EMI2.1 When the methoxyphenol IV and the ethoxyphenol V are reacted at alkaline conditions with epichlorohydrine 1,2 epoxy 3 4 1,2 dimethoxyethyl phenoxylpropane VI and 1,2 epoxy 3 14 1 ethoxy 2 methoxyethyl phenoxy propane VII are obtained.EMI2.2 When the methoxyepoxide VI and the ethoxyepoxide VII are reacted with isopropylamine 1 isopropylamino 3 4 1,2 dimethoxyethyl phenoxy 2 propanol VIII and l isopropylamino 3 4 1 ethoxy 2 methoxyethyl phenoxy 2 propanol IX are formed.EMI2.3 In the last step methoxymetroprolol VIII and ethoxymetopropol IX are reduced to metopropol I , which after this can be converted to e.g. the tartrate salt. Hydroeenation of the benzyl group is in itself a known reaction see e.g. Organic Reactions 7 1953 263 , but never before an alkoxy or aryloxy group was removed from an a alkylsubstituted alkyl or arylbenzylether by catalytic hydrogenation. The following reaction was thus not known before EMI3.1 OR wherein CH is an ether group.In the art, however, one case was known, in which a cyclic ether, substituted in the 2 position with a phenyl group, was hydrogenated as follows J. Am. Chem. Soc. 70 1948 1490 EMI3.2 This case differs very much from the case of the invention already because of the ether being cyclic.In addition to this some reactions are known in the art, in which an alkoxy group was removed from an a,a dialkyl alkyl benzylether by catalytic hydrogenation as follows J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89 1967 4233 and Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 43 1970 2143 EMI4.1 These two cases differ from the case of the invention primarily because the benzyl carbon is disubstituted, while it is monosubstituted in this invention. In addition to this Raney nickel and palladium hydride have been used as catasts in the above mentioned cases rather than a palladium catalyst, which is preferred for the present invention.The new process of the invention for the preparation of l isopropylamino 3 4 2 methoxyethyl phenoxy 2 propanol or metoprolol I thus also provides a new process for removing the alkoxy group from an d alkylsubstituted alkylbenzylether by catalytic hydrogenation.The intermediates of the invention are new compounds, except the hydroxyphenol III , which has been described in the Finnish application 792950.The above described two reaction series, the methoxy and the ethoxy route, are preferably performed all the way to the methoxy and ethoxymetoprolol VIII and IX without isolation of intermediates, which makes the practical accomplishment of the reaction series very easy and simple. Both reaction series also succeed with good yields. The reaction series canJif desired also be carried out so, that each intermediate or part of the intermediates are isolated. This is of course a much more laborious way than a reaction series without isolation of intermediates, especially on a technical scale. The reduction of the ketophenolate II to hydroxyphenolate III is preferably performed with sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent. e.g. water, but preferably inan alcohol because of the succeeding reaction. The reduction is carried out at a temperature of about 30 90 C, which also depends on the solvent used. If one wants to proceed using the methoxy route, it is most practical to carry out the reduction in methanol.By adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture after the reduction to the acid side with a suitable acid, e.g. concentrated sulfuric acid, and refluxing the reaction mixture after this, the methoxyphenol IV is directly obtained without isolation of the hydroxyphenol III . The methanol, used as solvent, hereby reacts with the hydroxyphenol. If the intention is to proceed using the ethoxy route, it is most advantageous to perform the reduction in ethanol and thereafter reflux the mixture correspondingly as above, in order to arrive directly at the ethoxyphenol V . Then the reaction mixtures are filtered. The methanolic solution is neutralized with e.g. sodium methoxide and the ethanolic solution correspondingly with sodium ethoxide.In the following step the methoxyphenol IV is reacted with epichlorohydrine at alkaline conditions, preferably in the presence of potassium carbonate, in methanolic solution without isolation of the above obtained methoxyphenol IV . The reaction is performed at the boiling point of the mixture or at a lower temperature. The ethoxyphenol V is reacted in a corresponding way in ethanolic solution. The methoxyepoxide VI in methanolic solution and the ethoxyepoxide VII in ethanolic solution are then preferably reacted with isopropylamine without changing the solvent either at the boiling point of the mixture or at a lower temperature.Methoxymetoprolol VIII and ethoxymetoprolol IX are then formed, and these are advantegously purified by extraction at this stage. In the final step the benzylethers, methoxy and ethoxymetoprolol Cviii and IX , are reduced primarily by catalytic hydrogenation to metoprolol I . The hydrogenation is preferably performed with a palladium on carbon catalyst in acetic acid in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. hydrogen chloride. The reaction proceeds with sufficient speed already at room temperature, and even at 1000C the reaction succeeds. It was very surprising that the reaction occurred so easily at elevated temperature and even more so at room temperature. At last the product can be converted to e.g. the tartrate salt.The invention is illustrated in more detail by the following examples.
