## Description
This invention relates to high strength alumi num products, and particularly to methods for increasing the toughness of such products without substantial loss of strength. High strength aluminum alloys and composites are required in certain applications, notably the air craft industry where the combination of high strength, high stiffness and low density is particularly important. High strength is generally achieved in aluminum alloys by combinations of copper, zinc and magnesium, and high stiffness is generally achieved by metal matrix compos ites such as those formed by the addition of silicon carbide, boron carbide or aluminum oxide particles to an aluminum matrix. Recently, aluminum lithium alloys containing 2.0 2.8 lithium by weight have been devel oped. These alloys possess a lower density and higher elastic modulus than conventional non lithium containing alloys. The preparation and properties of aluminum based alloys containing lithium are widely disclosed, notably in J. Stone Company, British Patent No. 787,665 December 11, 1957 Ger. Offen. 2,305,248 National Research Institute for Metals, Tokyo, January 24, 1974 Raclot, U.S. Patent No. 3,343,948 September 26, 1967 and Peel et al., British Patent No. 2,115,836 September 14, 1983 . Powder metallurgy techniques involving the blending of powdered constituents have been disclosed for a variety of purposes, notably by Fujitsu, Ltd., Japanese Patent No. 53 75107 1976 Giorgi et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,713,898 January 30, 1973 and Reen, U.S. Patent No. 3,713,817 January 30, 1973 . It is also well known that alloys can be made by mixing elemental powders and heating the mixture to a temperature high enough to cause diffusion to take place and form an alloy of uniform composition. See Unfortunately, high strength aluminum mater ials are frequently characterized by low toughness, as evidenced by impact tests on notched specimens e.g., Charpy tests and by fracture toughness tests on fatigue precracked specimens where the critical stress intensity factors are determined. It has now been discovered that high strength and high toughness can be achieved simultaneously in a single aluminum based metallic product by dispersing particles of a high toughness aluminum based metal through a matrix comprised of a high strength aluminum based metal. The dispersion is most conveniently achieved by powder metallurgy techniques. In some cases, the result is a compromise between strength and tough ness. The overall result, however, is a combination of strength and toughness which is a substantial improve ment over prior art composites and alloys. The present invention is applicable to high strength aluminum based metallic materials of a wide range of composition, including both alloys and high strength composites having a yield strength of at least about 30ksi thousand pounds per square inch , prefer ably at least about 50ksi, when heat treated to the highest level. This includes such alloys as those con taining lithium, copper, magnesium or zinc as the pri mary alloying element, notably alloys of the 2000, 5000, 7000, and 8000 Aluminum Association series. Examples are the alloys 2014, 2018, 2024, 2025, 2090, 2218, 2618, 7001, 7039, 7072, 7075, 7079, 7178 and 8090. The term primary alloying element is used herein to designate any element which amounts to about 1 or more by weight of the alloy, preferably 2 or more. High strength composites to which the present invention is applicable include a wide range of products wherein aluminum matrices are reinforced with particles, whiskers or fibers of various materials having a high strength or modulus. Examples of the reinforcing phase include boron fibers, B₄C coated boron, SiC coated boron, B₄C whiskers and particles, SiC whiskers and particles, carbon or graphite fibers, fused silica, alumina, steel, beryllium, tungsten and titanium. The alloys are gen erally preferred. The high toughness component of the present invention may be an aluminum based alloy or composite with an impact toughness of at least about 20 foot pounds, preferably at least about 50 foot pounds, or aluminum itself. The term impact toughness as used herein designates a value determined by conventional impact techniques, notably the Charpy test technique, a standard procedure established by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Straight aluminum having a maximum impurity level of about 0.5 by weight is pre ferred. Commercially pure aluminum will generally suf fice. The composite of the present invention may be formed by blending particles of the two components in the desired proportion. The particle size is not criti cal and may vary over a wide range. In most applica tions, particles ranging in diameter from about 10 to about 1,000 microns, preferably from about 50 to about 500 microns, or having a volume of about 0.0001 to about 0.01 cubic centimeters each, will provide the best re sults. It is preferred that the particles of both com ponents have approximately the same size range. The relative amounts of the components may also vary widely, depending upon the composition of each component and upon the desired properties of the ultimate product. Composites containing from about 2 to about 40 by weight of the high toughness component, preferably from about 5 to about 25 by weight, will generally provide the best results. The particles themselves may be formed accord ing to conventional techniques, including pulverization, ribbon and splat techniques. Once the powders are formed and sized and appropriate amounts selected, blending is achieved by conventional means. The blended powders are then consolidated, again by conventional means, to form a billet which can be further processed into the ultimate product. Consol idation may be achieved by unidirectional compaction including canister techniques , isostatic compaction both cold and hot , rolling, forging, sintering, or other known methods. Consolidation preferably includes compaction to at least about 85 full density, more preferably at least about 95 . It is particularly pre ferred that the consolidation and compaction processing steps include the removal of substantially all bound water from the surface of the particles prior to the achievement of full density. This is generally achieved by purging the particle mixture with an inert gas and or degassing the particles either prior to consolidation or after partial compaction, involving the use of reduced pressure and elevated temperature, preferably not exceed ing about 1100 F 593 C . In many cases, the increase in toughness will be accompanied by a loss in strength. In general, the former will more than compensate for the latter, result ing in a product which is improved in overall properties. The following examples are offered for purposes of illustration, and are intended neither to define nor limit the invention in any manner. A composite product was prepared as follows. A powdered aluminum lithium alloy containing 2.41 Li, 1.21 Cu, 0.73 Mg and 0.11 Zr designated herein as 1611 was prepared by a conventional powder metallurgy technique, involving melting and combining the component metals at 1700 F 927 C and atomizing the melt in an inert gas. The resulting particles were sized to 100 mesh U.S. Sieve Series . The particles were then blended for 2 hours at room temperature in a rotating V shaped blender with similarly sized particles of commercially pure aluminum minimum purity 99.5 , the latter comprising 10 of the total mixture. The mixture was then heated to 900 F 482 C , degassed and consolidated by compaction to full density in a canister. The billet was then removed from the canister and extruded at 850 F 454 C at a 29 to 1 ratio, followed by solution heat treatment, stretching in the direction of extrusion to a 5 length increase and aging for 16 100 hours. Different samples were aged at different temperatures. Tensile properties and impact toughness values were then measured on specimens from the samples as well as samples prepared in the identical manner but without the inclusion of the pure aluminum powder. The tensile tests were performed on round specimens 0.25 inch 0.64cm in diameter with a gage length of 1.0 inch 2.54cm , taken from the extrusion edge of the sample, using standard ASTM testing procedures. Longi tudinal tests were performed on both center and edge samples, the latter representing the short transverse edges of the extrusion. Table 1.1 below lists yield strengths and elongations measured in the longitudinal direction for the various aging temperatures, most entries indicating several trials. An average value for each aging temper ature is shown graphically in FIG. 1 edge results and FIG. 2 center results , where the 300 F values are for 16h aging time. It is evident from these figures that some loss in strength resulted from incorporating the pure aluminum, while the elongation on the average was approximately unchanged. Table 1.2 lists yield strengths and elonga tions measured in the transverse direction for the same aging temperatures. Samples from two different locations were taken for each aging temperature, as shown in the table. Averages for each pair are shown graphically in FIG. 3. Once again, a loss of yield strength is observed while elongation is generally unchanged. Impact values were determined in the longitu dinal direction by Charpy impact tests, using lOmm square, V notched specimens at ambient temperature, the notches running transverse to the direction of extrusion. Multiple specimens from both the center and edge of the extruded samples at the extrusion edge were tested. The results are shown in Table 1.3. Averaged values are shown graphically in FIG. 4, where the 300 F values are for 16h aging time. It is clear from these figures that the impact tough ness is consistently higher in the samples containing the added unalloyed aluminum. Fracture toughness values K The samples containing the added unalloyed aluminum are consistently superior. Stress corrosion cracking thresholds were determined in the same manner, except that the speci mens were subjected to controlled drips of 3.5 aqueous sodium chloride solution during the test, which lasted three weeks. The thresholds at various aging tempera tures are shown in Table 1.5. Again, the results for the samples containing the added unalloyed aluminum are consistently higher. While the data above indicate an increase in toughness at the expense of strength, FIGS. 6 and 7 demonstrate that the overall result, i.e., the combi nation of strength and toughness at both center and edge of the extrusion, measured longitudinally, is su perior for the product containing the added unalloyed aluminum. The values for the points in these graphs are given in Tables 1.6 and 1.7, each of which cover a range of aging conditions in terms of both temperature and time. The ranges extend from mild conditions through optimum conditions resulting in peak properties and beyond into overaging with detrimental effects. Since overaging is both detrimental and wasteful of both energy and processing time, the results plotted for comparison in the figures are those corresponding to aging conditions increasing to and including the opti mum but not beyond. In FIG.6 and Table 1.6, the opti mum is generally between 300 F at 40 hours and 340 F at 100 hours, whereas in FIG. 7 and Table 1.7, the opti mum is 300 F at 40 hours. The figures show a general improvement in the combination of strength and toughness for both center and edge up to these conditions, for the product containing the unalloyed aluminum. A composite product was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1, using, however, an aluminum lithium alloy containing 3.49 Li, 1.25 Cu, 0.74 Mg and 0.12 Zr designated herein as 1614 . The test procedures of Example 1 were applied. Tensile properties measured in the longitudinal direc tion at the center of the extrusion for different aging temperatures are listed in Table 2.1 below and shown graphically in FIG. 8. Tensile properties measured in the longitudi nal direction at the side edge of the extrusion are listed in Table 2.2 and the averages shown graphically in FIG. 9. Tensile properties measured in the transverse direction are listed in Table 2.3 and the averages shown graphically in FIG. 10. Charpy impact test results, following again the procedure of Example 1, are listed in Table 2.4 and the averages shown graphically in FIG. 11. Collectively, the data in these tables and figures indicate a consistent large improvement in toughness in the samples containing the added unalloyed aluminum, with only a small decrease in strength, and in some cases, no decrease at all. That the overall result is an improvement is confirmed by FIG. 12, which is a plot of data taken from Tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. To demonstrate that the toughness increase in these alloys is not simply a result of the decreased lithium content when unalloyed aluminum is added, the Charpy impact values are plotted as a function of lith ium content in FIG. 13 for the four alloys covered by Examples 1 and 2. These values all represent the data from aging at 250 F for 16 hours. While toughness does decrease with increased lithium content, the plot demon strates that at the same lithium level, the products containing the added unalloyed aluminum are tougher than those composed of the straight alloys. This is evidenced by the vertical distance between the dashed and solid lines. Similarly, a given lithium content in a composite product containing added unalloyed aluminum produces the same toughness as a straight alloy with a higher lithium content compare alloy 1611 with the composite of alloy 1614 and 10 added aluminum hori zontal distance between dashed and solid lines . Plots of the data for the other aging temperatures show the same types of differences. The foregoing description is offered for il lustrative purposes only. Numerous modifications and variations of the procedures and materials described above, while still falling within the spirit and scope of the invention, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
