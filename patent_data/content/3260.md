# Integrated injection logic digital to analog converter employing feedback regulation and method therefor.

## Abstract
A digital to analog converter circuit suitable for implementation as an integrated circuit in integrated injection logic form, and a method for regulating the collector current in a plurality of integrated injection logic transistors are disclosed. A plurality of switching transistors 25 29 are connected to digital input terminals 20 23 and the currents conducted by the plurality of switching transistors are summed to yield an analog output current. An injection bar 35 shared by each of the switching transistors provides drive current to the plurality of switching transistors. The injection bar is also shared by one or more reference transistors 36 39 , the current in which is determined by a current source 51 . A feedback circuit 45 is used to regulate the bias of the common injection bar such that the current conducted by each switching device corresponds to the current conducted by each reference device.
