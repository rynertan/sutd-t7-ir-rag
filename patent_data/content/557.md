# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A novel semiconductor laser device in which a longitudinal and transverse mode is stabilized and in which any excess optical noise for a modulated signal is not generated by mode competition is provided. The fundamental construction of the semiconductor laser device comprises at least a structure wherein a first semiconductor layer 3 is sandwiched between second and third semiconductor layers 2, 4 which are greater in the band gap and lower in the refractive index than the first semiconductor layer. That region of at least one of the second and third semiconductor layers 2, 4 which is remote from the first semiconductor layer 3 is made a semiconductor layer which corresponds substantially to a radiation region and which serves as a light non absorptive region in the shape of a stripe 9 . A semiconductor layer 1 is disposed which has portions lying on both sides of the semiconductor layer 9 remote from the first semiconductor layer 3 and which makes an effective complex refractive index for laser light discontinuous at both the ends of the semiconductor layer remote from the first semiconductor layer 3 . Periodic corrugations 8 which intersect orthogonally to the lengthwise direction of the stripe shaped light non absorptive region are formed in at least one interface of the aforecited semiconductor layers in a manner to include at least a region corresponding to the light non absorptive region.
