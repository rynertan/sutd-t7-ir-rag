# A METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING MULTILAYERED COATINGS

## Abstract
A workpiece 7 is coated in an ion plating vacuum chamber 1 with material. A reactive gas, such as oxygen, is introduced into the chamber and reacts with the basic coating material to form a different coating layer. By varying the introduction of reactive gas, possibly mixed with an inert gas, such as argon, layers of material of differing composi tions may be sequentially laid on the workpiece.
