## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to thermally stable, high surface area inorganic oxide gels, their preparation and use as hydrocarbon conversion catalysts. In particular, it relates to the thermal stabilization and formation of mixed titanium oxide gels, or co gels.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART Inorganic oxide gels have been known and used for many years for various purposes, e.g., as adsorbents, catalyst supports, and catalysts. Few of these gels, in the relative sense, however, have been used as catalyst supports because only a handful have sufficient surface area and adequate pore volume, particularly at present day process conditions. Thus alumina A1203 , silica SiO2 , silica alumina SiO2 A1203 , and crystalline silica alumina SiO2 A1203 such as the zeolites, represent the preponderance of the inorganic oxide gels which have been commercially used as catalyst supports, or catalysts in the petroleum, chemical and related industries.These inorganic oxide gels, which are the exceptions among the inorganic oxide gels, can be prepared in forms which have high surface area and adequate pore volume, and they are stable in most environments at high temperatures.Most other inorganic oxide gels, even if they can be prepared in form having adequate high surface area and pore volume, are not stable at high temperatures. For example, titanium oxide TiO2 can be prepared in high surface area form, but at normal hydrocarbon processing temperatures, i.e., about 7500F to about 9300F, and higher, titanium oxide loses its surface area. Con sequentially, titanium oxide is unsuitable as a catalyst carrier or catalyst at normal hydrocarbon processing conditions. The preparation of titanium oxide gels is disclosed, e.g., in U.S. 2,682,242 U.S. 2,553,402 U.S. 2,584,286 and U.S. 3,092,457. Particular reference is made to this latter reference, i.e., U.S 3,092,457 which discloses the preparation of a titania gel of good purity with reasonably high surface area.In accordance with the teaching of this patent, titanium isopropoxide was acetolyzed with glacial acetic acid, and the resulting solution then hydrolyzed with water to form a clear sol which gelled overnight.The hydrolyzed gel was then dried, calcined and the gel ground to a small particle size to provide particles of surface area ranging from 75 to 125 m2 g. Certain classes of expandable clay minerals, or smectites have been used as adsorbents, but very little has been reported in the literature regarding the use of these materials as catalysts. The adsorption of aromatics such as benzene and phenol from aqueous solution on smectites such as montmorillionite has been reported but these materials also lack thermal stability. Most of the literature in the last few years has dealt mainly with the preparation and physical properties of these materials. However, two recent publications by J. Shabtai et al, viz.J. Shabtai, R. Lazar A. Obead Tokyo CatalysisCongress 1980 Preprints, and J. Shabtai, R. Lazar BR N. Frydman J. Chem. Soc. 1977 pg. 660, do disclose the catalytic activity of montmorillionites in cracking and esterification reactions. A hydrogenation catalyst is reported by T. Pinnavaia using hectorite. Reference is made to W. Quayle T. J. Pinnavaia, Inorg. Chem.18, 10, 2840, 1979. Stable pillared interlayered clay compositions which possess considerable micropore volume and have useful adsorbent and catalytic properties are prepared, as described in U.S. 4,176,090 by reacting smectite type clays with polymeric cationic hydroxy metal complexes of metals such as aluminum, zirconium, and or titanium. The use of smectites as catalysts, however, is quite limited due to their low surface area and their insufficient thermal stability in high temperature processes. It is accordingly a primary objective of the present invention to obviate these and other prior art deficiencies and, in particular, to provide the art with improved oxide catalyst supports or catalysts having improved surface area, particularly titania oxide catalyst supports or titania oxide catalysts which significantly retain their surface area at relatively high temperatures and methods for making such improved oxide catalyst supports or catalysts as well as their use in hydrocarbon conversion processes. A specific object is to provide a new and improved process for the preparation of a titanium oxide co gel with relatively high surface area which can be thermally activated at relatively high temperatures without significant loss of surface area, the titanium oxide co gel being suitable as a catalyst support or catalyst for use in high temperature hydrocarbon conversion reactions. These objects and others are achieved in accordance with the present invention embodying a process for co gelling a smectite with a Group IV B metal oxide of the Periodic Table of the Elements E. H.Sargent Co., Copyright 1962 Dyna Slide Co. , e.g., titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, and the like and other metal oxides such as an oxide of thorium, uranium, silicon, aluminum, and the like particularly an inorganic metal oxide which is unstable with respect to retaining a high surface area, to produce a co gel of high surface area which has good retention of surface area at high temperatures. Suitable smectites for the practice of this invention are hectorite, chlorite, montmorillionite, beidellite, or admixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, a titanium dioxide gel is stabilized against thermal desurfacing by co gelling said titanium dioxide gel with a smectite.The resultant co gel is one having a surface area higher than the original titanium oxide gel, or smectite, and the co gel has good surface area retention at high temperatures such as is required in processing hydrocarbons. A titania gel is first prepared by the acetolysis of an organo , or hydrocarbyl titanium compound, or salt, by a conventional method as disclosed in U.S. 3,092,457, supra, herewith incorporated by reference. An organo , or hydrocarbyl titanium compound, suitably an organic ester of titanic acid, e.g., tetraisopropyl titanate, is reacted with glacial acetic acid in solution, suitably e.g., an alcohol water solution, and reaction continued until acetolysis is complete. To this solution, after completion of acetolysis, is then added the smectite gel, and water, suitably as an aqueous solution of the smectite gel, to hydrolyze the reaction product resultant from the acetotysis. On setting, a co gel of the titanium oxide gel and smectite is formed. The co gel is separated from the solution, dried and calcined. The composition which is produced possesses a greater surface area than either of its components as inorganic oxides, and has a greater thermal stability toward loss of surface area. The resultant composition is useful for effecting catalytic conversions either alone or when supported on a carrier, and with or without the additional presence of other catalytically active components therewith or dispersed thereon as supported metals. The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples, and demonstrations, which illustrate its more salient features. All terms are given in terms of weight except as otherwise specified.EXAMPLES I In accordance with the teachings ofU.S. 3,092,457, supra, 274.5 g. of titanium isopropoxide was acetolyzed with 250 cc of glacial acetic acid. Instead of hydrolyzing with water as taught in the U.S. patent, 80.0 g. of Bentonite Curtin technical grade was dispersed in 500 cc deionized water to which 300 g. of H20 ice was added. When the ice was melted, the Bentonite gel was added to the titanium containing solution with a high rate of stirring to facilitate co gel formation. An additional 1000 cc of water was added to the gel to facilitate stirring. This procedure was repeated reversing the order of addition, that is instead of adding the water to the titanium oxide precursor, the titanium oxide precursor was added to the aqueous gel. This procedure is referred to as reverse addition whereas the former is referred to as forward addition. For purposes of comparison, a TiO2 was prepared by a conventional method as also disclosed inU.S. 3,092,457. All of the gels were calcined for at least 4 hours at 4000C to remove water and to establish the gel structure. In addition, the Bentonite was also calcaned for 4 hours at 4000C for purposes of comparison.Samples of all the materials so prepared were then calcined for an additional 4 hours at various temperatures ranging from 400 5500C. The surface areas of the materials calcined at various temperatures were determined by the B.E.T. method, and are presented inTable I.

In addition, the data also show that forward addition is preferred to reverse addition in terms of creating more surface area in the gel, although both techniques improve the thermal stability.For the case of forward addition, there is no loss of surface area with increasing cal cination temperature. For the case of reverse addition, the surface area loss on calcination is much less than would be expected on the basis of simple ratios.Reference is made to Table II.

The quantities used in the preparation of the two Bentonite Ti02 co gels would give weights corresponding to a physical mixture of 80.0 g. Bentonite and 80 g. TiO2.Using surface areas of 45.2 m2 g for the Bentonite and 97.9 m2 g for theTiO2 gel and the weight ratio of the mixture used in the preparations, i.e., 80 45.2 80 87.9 71.55 80 80 a surface area of 71.55 m2 g would be expected for the co gel. Instead, depending on the order of addition, surface areas of 204.0 and 191.6 m2 g were obtained at the same calcination conditions. Reference is made toTable 3.

The following data show that the titanium dioxide bentonite co gel compositions possess catalytic cracking activity, to wit II 8.70 gms of titanium dioxide bentonite co gel 1 1 by weight which had been calcined for four hours at 4000C and recalcined for four hours at 5500C was weighed out. Ceric ammonium nitrate in an amount of 0.69 gms was weighed out and dissolved in 5 cc of deionized water. This solution was added to the co gel by the method of incipient wetness. The preparation was dried in vacuo at 860C for three hours, subsequently calcined at 4000C for two and one half hours, and the catalyst then tested for catalytic cracking activity in a micro activity test MAT essentially similar to ASTM D3907 80. Conversion obtained was 35.1 volume percent, and the hydrogen yield was 0.8878 weight percent based on feed. III To 50.06 gms of the co gel described in II was added 18.33 cc of deionized water solution which contained 0.83 gm of ammonium hydrofluoride,NH4Hf2, by the method of incipient wetness. After drying, the catalyst was calcined at 5000C for five hours. This catalyst was also given a micro activity test for catalytic cracking activity. Conversion obtained was 38.2 volume percent and the hydrogen yield was 0.5342 weight percent on feed. IV The acidic character of the co gels of this invention can be increased by compositing an acidic crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, or more than one crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite with said co gel. Suitably, such a composite can contain up to about 50 percent of said crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, or crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, and preferably contains from about 2 percent to about 25 percent, or more preferably from about 3 percent to about 10 percent of a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, based on the weight of the total composition. A catalytically active metal, or metals, can be deposited on either the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite composite, or the co gel component, or both.The composite catalysts can also be constituted of the co gel and zeolite components, and if desirable, a binding component, or components, and a metal or metals and additional components. Such composites are useful as catalysts in petroleum and petrochemical processing. Composite catalysts containing USY zeolite at both 5 wt. and 10 wt. levels, respectively, were made from the thermally stable titanium dioxide bentonite co gel and USY zeolite. The zeolite was dispersed in aqueous bentonite gel used to hydrolyze the acetolyzed titanium alkoxide. The aqueous bentonite gel was alkalized with aqueous ammonia solution to provide a buffered pH during co gel synthesis to protect the zeolite from the hydrolytic effects of the acetic acid used to acetolyze the titanium alkoxide. These catalysts were each charged to a reactor and two separate runs made by passing a gas oil feed over each in standard MAT tests. MAT is a microactivity test.
