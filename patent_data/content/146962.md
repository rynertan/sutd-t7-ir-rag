# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE HAVING HETERO STRUCTURE

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a semiconductor device having a first semiconductor layer and a second semiconductor layer that are arranged to form a hetero junction, a band gap of said first semiconductor layer being smaller than that of said second semiconductor layer, and having a source and a drain that are electronically connected to said first semicon ductor layer, and further having a gate electrode, wherein there exists at least a region containing impurities at a concentration of smaller than 10¹⁶ cm ³ between said source and said drain, and said drain region is not separated away from an end of the gate by more than the thickness a depletion layer. This enables the breakdown voltage to be increased between the drain and the gate, and the tolerance to be increased in the manufacturing steps.
