# HIGH SPEED RESIDUE CALCULATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Residue calculation included in an RSA encipherment op eration process is carried out at a high speed by a simple hard ware arrangement, such that a multiple of a predetermined divisor more than two orders in magnitude larger than the divisor is stored in a memory 105 or that a partial residue relative to the divisor in each section defined by splitting an optional dividend into given unitary digit figures is stored in a memory, thus performing residue calculation of the given div idend while referring to the content of the memory 105 .
