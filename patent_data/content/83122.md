# A NOZZLE REACTOR AND METHOD OF USE THEREOF IN ATOMISING AND MIXING FLUID REACTANTS

## Abstract
A spray mixing nozzle and a method for reacting an acidic fluid and a basic fluid by using the spray mixing nozzle. The nozzle includes a central channel, at least one intermediate annular channel surrounding said central channel, an outer annular channel and a mixing chamber having a generally cylindrical upper section, a generally conically shaped lower section and an axially aligned discharge orifice. The acidic fluid and the basic fluid are directed through the central channel and the intermediate annular channel into the upper section of the mixing chamber at relatively low velocities and a pressurized gas is simultaneously directed through the outer annular channel into the upper section of the mixing channel at a relatively high velocity. The high velocity gas acts to strip apart and at least partially atomize the acidic fluid stream and the basic fluid stream in the upper section of the mixing chamber. The gas and the partially atomized fluids are then subjected to a high degree of turbulence in the lower section of the mixing chamber and thereby substantially completely atomized and mix the fluids. The mixed and atomized fluids then begin to react and form a powdery or highly viscous paste product which is discharged from the discharge orifice.
