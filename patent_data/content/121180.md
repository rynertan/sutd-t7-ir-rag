# Vacuum interrupter.

## Abstract
A vacuum interrupter of more inproved large current interrupting capability and dielectric strength is disclosed. The interrupter has a pair of separable contact electrodes 5, 6 , a vacuum envelope 4 electrically insulating and enclosing the pair therewithin, a contact making portion 14 of material of 20 to 60 IACS electrical conductivity being a part of one contact electrode 6 of the pair, a magnetically arc rotating portion 13 of material of 2 to 30 IACS electrical conductivity secured to the contact making portion 14 so as to be apart from the other contact electrode 5 when the contact electrodes 5, 6 are into engagement, and means, which include a plurality of slots extending radially and circumferen tially of the magnetically arc rotating portion 13 and being apart from each other, for magnetically rotating arc estab lished between the contact electrodes 5, 6 on an arcing sur face of the contact electrode 6 .
