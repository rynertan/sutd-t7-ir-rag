# Digital, electromagnetic nuclear reactor control rod position indicator with compensation.

## Abstract
A digital rod position indicator having discrete coils spaced along the travel path of an elongated magnetically permeable member stores in digital form compensation signals for automatically adjusting the location relative to the coils at which the digital output signal representative of the position of the end of the elongate member transitions from one code to the next. The appropriate compensation signal is addressed using the digital output signal and a correction factor which takes into account the direction of movement including reversals.
