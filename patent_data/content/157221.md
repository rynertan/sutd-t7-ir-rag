# Laser shielding device.

## Abstract
A laser shielding device comprises two spaced apart lay ers 30, 31 of shielding material defining a sealed chamber 33 between the two layers. At least one layer will degrade in the presence of an impinging laser beam, creating a hole through the layer. Flow of gas into or from said chamber 33 , which may be detected by a pressure switch 42 , or which may be detected by a sniffer , is sensed and signalled to a machine controller to activate an alarm and or to stop the lasing operation.
