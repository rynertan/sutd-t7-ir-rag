# Process for producing spherical graphite castings.

## Abstract
A process for producing spherical graphite cast iron characterized by arranging a required amount of sphering alloy blocks 13 in the hollow part 15 for making a product of a casting mold and then pouring a melt into the casting mold. A process for producing compound castings consisting of spherical graphite cast iron and ordinary cast iron character ized by arranging a required amount of sphering alloy blocks in the hollow part for making a product and requiring the strength of the product of a casting mold and pouring an ordinary cast iron melt into the casting mold.
