## Description
A Dispenser for Paper The subject invention concerns a dispenser designed to hold paper in the form of a continuous web which is arranged to be withdrawn from the dispenser through at least one opening formed in the dispenser bottom wall and then be torn off. The dispenser comprises a housing in the form of a section which may be displaced relative to the rest of the dispenser in order to allow supply of additional paper into the dispenser.The paper web may be in the form of a roll or a pleated paper web. The paper web may be intended for household use, kitchen paper, toilet paper, cleaning paper in workshops and garages, petrol stations or the like. One example of a dispenser of the kind referred to is described in SE 389 086. This dispenser is common in workshops, garages, petrol stations and the like. The dispenser comprises a bottom section which is formed with a downwardly directed annular tear off edge, and with a lid which is arranged to be positioned on the bottom portion to enclose a paper roll supported thereon. The paper roll is arranged to be wound off from within the roll.This construction has certain disadvantages. One is that the dispenser is formed in two separate parts which may be removed from each other. This is particularly disadvantageous when the dispenser is used and mounted outdoors, for instance in petrol stations where it is exposed to the risk of being wilfully destructed. Preferably, dispensers used in these and similar public applications should be sturdy and able to withstand rough handling. The purpose of the subject invention is to provide a dispenser which is functional and sturdy and is able to withstand vandalism and similar destruction. This purpose is achieved in a dispenser in accordance with the subject invention which is characterized therein that it is provided at least along part of its lower edge with a tear off edge and in that the dispenser housing is arranged to be folded upwards to a position in which it may be locked by latch means. Further advantages and characteristics of the invention will become apparent from the following description and the dependent claims. The invention will be described in closer detail in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a dispenser in accordance with the invention, Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view through the dispenser, and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a dispenser in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention. The drawings show two different embodiments of the dispenser in accordance with the invention, viz.a first embodiment, which 3s illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 and which is intended to hold one single paper roll and a second embodiment which is illustrated in Fig. 3 and is intended to hold two rolls the paper webs of which are tied together. The dispenser designated generally by numeral 10 comprises according to Figs. 1 and 2 an attachment bracket or rear plate 12, a bottom wall 14 attached thereto and a housing 16 which is pivotally mounted to the bracket 12. The housing is mounted on the bracket 12 by means of a pivot shaft 18 at the upper edge of the bracket. The bracket 12 consists of a rear wall 20 from which project forwards two lateral flanges 22. The housing 16 consists of a front wall 24, lateral flanges 26 and a lid 28. The lateral flanges 26 of the housing 16 enclose the lateral flanges 22 and form the side walls of the dispenser. In the outwards folded position of the housing 16 the inner lateral flanges serve as guide members guiding a paper roll 28 supported in an upright position inside the dispenser. The paper roll is of the kind the paper web of which is wound off from within. The paper roll 28 is positioned on the bottom 14 in which is formed an opening 30 through which paper may be withdrawn in the form of a paper web 32 from the roll 28. At its lower edge the housing is provided with a serrated tear off edge 34. The latter extends along the front 24 of the housing and along part of the lateral flanges 26 up to the front edges of the inner side flanges 22. The tear off edge 34 is positioned some distance from the opening 30 so that when a length of the paper web 32 has been torn off a piece of the paper web 32 is left depending from the opening 30. This depending piece of paper web may be easily grasped to pull out a further length of paper. The housing 16 is provided with a locking mechanism 36 comprising a pivotable plate 38 which may be pivoted to a position in which it catches behind a flange 40 which extends downwards from the bottom plate 14. When the plate 38 is pivoted away from the locking position the housing 16 may be moved away to allow a fresh paper roll to be deposited inside the dispenser. Fig. 3 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention. The dispenser according to this embodiment is designed to hold two paper rolls the paper webs of which are tied together to form one continuous paper web. The tying together is effected in such a manner that the trailing end outer end of the web on one roll is tied together with the starting end inner end of the web On the other roll. The double dispenser, designated generally by numeral 42, is designed in a manner identi cal to that of the single roll dispenser 10 and comprises an attachment bracket 44, a bottom wall 46 attached thereto and a foldable housing 48 which may be locked to the bottom wall 46 when in its downwards folded position. The width of the dispenser obviously is adjusted to accommodate two rolls 28.The bottom wall is formed with an opening 50 which extends essentially intermediate the centres of the two rolls and since the winding off of the paper web takes place from the inner part of the roll the centres of the rolls coincide with their windingoff points. The opening 50 is provided with guide rails 52 which are open in the direction facing the middle of the opening 50 to guide the paper web 32 in such a manner that the latter will be withdrawn at the centre of the opening 50, irrespective of whether it is being unwound from the first or from the second roll. The two embodiments of the dispensers 10, 42 in accordance with the invention have slits 54 formed in their respective housing 16, 48 for inspection purposes. The slit makes it possible to establish by visual inspection when the supply of paper on the rolls 28 inside the dispenser 42 needs replenishing. When this occurs a fresh roll is placed on the empty space and the inner or starting end of the paper web of the fresh roll is tied to the outer or trailing end of the remaining roll.I n this way the double dispenser 42 will never be empty. The housing 16, 48 may be latched in its upwards folded position in the manner appearing from Fig. 3, viz. by the provision of a spring biased latch pin 56 provided at each inner side flange. To fold the housing 6, 48 downwards, the latch pins 56 are pushed inwards. A partition 58 is provided inside the dispenser 42 to support the rolls 28. The embodiments of the invention described in the aforegoing are to be regarded as examples only and a number of different embodiments are possible within the scope of the appended claims. It lies within the scope of the invention to provide the double roll dispenser 42 with two openings, one underneath each roll 28 instead of with a single opening 50. In this case the tied together paper web must be passed through both openings to ensure that withdrawal of the second roll will be effected through the associated opening upon shifting over from one roll to the other.
