# CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ALCOHOL SOLUTION

## Abstract
A process for the continuous conversion of a starch containing biomass to an alcohol containing liquor suitable for distillation or other means of alcohol separation and the concomitant production of distiller grains and distillers solubles, which comprises cooking the starch containing biomass, slurrying the cooked biomass with water, breaking down the starch molecules in the slurry, pasteurizing the starch slurry at a temperature of from 71 C to 99 C to form starch dissolved and suspended in water, and spent biomass solids, separating the solids from the dissolved and sus pended starch solution by countercurrent separation, recov ering the separated solids as distillers grains, converting the dissolved and suspended starch solution to a glucose solution, fermenting the glucose to an alcohol containing liquor and post fermentation solids, and recovering the post fermentation solids as distillers solubles.
