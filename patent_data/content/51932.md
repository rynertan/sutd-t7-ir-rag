# Point focus radiation concentrator.

## Abstract
A point focus radiation concentrator 38 using two linear echelon surfaces 40, 42 crossed at approximately 90 degrees with the two linear echelon surfaces 40, 42 having a generally cylindrical shape with a radius of curvature 52 approximately equal to the focal distance 10 . The two echelon surfaces 40, 42 may be formed on separate sheets positioned in close proximity to each other or may be formed on opposite sides of a single sheet. The cross section of the curved concentrator sur face may be circular or other aspherical shape, such as parabolic, ellipsoid and hyperbolic.
