# Electrically conductive silicone rubber compositions.

## Abstract
Cured electrically conductive silicone rubber products exhibiting bleed out of a silicone oil at a controlled rate are prepared from compositions containing carbon black and a curable polyorganosiloxane wherein 90 mol of the silicon bonded hydrocarbon groups are methyl. The silicon oil is a liquid polyorganosiloxane containing at least 1 mol , based on the total number of hydrocarbon radicals present in said silicone oil, of silicon bonded halogenated hydrocarbon radicals and the silicone oil is incompatible with the cured silicone rubber product.
