# Acoustic microscope.

## Abstract
In an acoustic microscope wherein a piezoelectric transducer 10 disposed on one face 21 of an ultrasonic wave focusing lens 20 radiates an ultrasonic wave into the lens and also converts into an electric signal a wave reflected from a specimen 50 arranged on the side of the other face 30 of the lens, the wave reflected from the interface of the lens and the wave reflected from the spec imen are caused to interfere with each other.
