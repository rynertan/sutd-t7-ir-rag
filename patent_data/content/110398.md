# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus equipped with a first and second supporting frames 102, 104 connected to each other for relative pivotal movement between an open position and a closed position. The first supporting frame 102 has pro vided therein a rotatably mounted interlocking input gear 336 and a first power transmission system 310 drivingly connect ed to the interlocking input gear 336 . The second supporting frame 104 has provided therein a drive source 308 , a sec ond power transmission system 312 drivingly connected to the drive source 308 and a rotatably mounted interlocking output gear 332 drivingly connected to the drive source 308 . A pivot member 378 mounted pivotally about the axis of rotation of the interlocking input gear 336 or the interlock ing output gear 332 and elastically held at a predetermined angular position by a spring means is provided in the first or second supporting frame. An interlocking linking gear 334 is rotatably mounted on the pivot member 378 . The interlocking linking gear 334 is drivingly connected to the interlocking in put gear 336 or the interlocking output gear 332 rotatable over a slight angular range. When the first and second support ing frames 102, 104 are relatively pivoted and brought to the closed position, the interlocking linking gear 334 comes into engagement with the interlocking output 332 or input gear 336 .
