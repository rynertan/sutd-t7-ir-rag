# Monitoring system using redundant electro optical modulators.

## Abstract
A monitoring system having redundant logic channels 18a, 18b for maintaining electrical and physical isolation between channels. The separate redundant logic channels each include an electro optic modulator 24a, 24b connected by a fiber optic link, with system condition sensors 14a, 14b coupled to the respective electro optic modulators to control the light transmission characteristics of the electro optic modulators 24a, 24b in response to a predetermined system condition. A light source 28 is connected by input fiber optics 30 to the logic channels 18a, 18b , and output fiber optics 34 connect the logic channels to a light detector means 32 .
