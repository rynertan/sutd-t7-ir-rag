# IMPROVED METHOD FOR REDUCING A BINARY IMAGE

## Abstract
An improved method of reducing a binary digital image in size by a factor F by storing the image in bit sequence removing one or more rows of bits along the vertical axis of the image to convert i rows of bits to j rows of bits where 0.5i j i modifying a line adjacent to each line discarded to preserve selected information from the discarded line re peating the steps of removing and modifying a predeter mined number of times to achieve a reduction by a factor F1 along the vertical axis rotating the image in a first direction by ninety degrees removing one or more rows of bits along the original horizontal axis of the image to convert i rows of bits to j rows of bits where 0.5i j i modifying a line adjacent to each line discarded to preserve selected information from the discarded line repeating the steps of removing and mod ifying a predetermined number of times to achieve a reduc tion by a factor F2 along the original horizontal axis rotating the image back to its original orientation storing the reduced size image generated by the above steps.
