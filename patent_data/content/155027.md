# Continuous process and an apparatus for the catalytic treatment of hydrocarbon oils.

## Abstract
A continuous process for the catalytic treatment of a hydro carbon oil and an apparatus for carrying out such process, by passing said oil through one or more catalyst beds 10, 25 within a reactor 1 wherein catalyst is withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor 1 and fresh catalyst is supplied via the top thereof, said catalyst being withdrawn through a discharge funnel 26 con tained in the bottom of said reactor 1 , which funnel 26 allows for separation of product from the catalyst via a screen 16 located in the funnel 26 upstream of the exit end 7 of said funnel 26 , the withdrawal of product being effected via a product outlet 6 , in which process use is made of a further screen 17 forming part of the discharge funnel system, located between the main screen 16 of the funnel 26 and the product outlet 6 and having a larger mesh size.
