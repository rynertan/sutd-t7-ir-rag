# Reductive smelting of sulfides and a burner therefor.

## Abstract
A burner and method for smelting metallic sulfide concentrates in a reverberatory furnace. The concentrates are passed through a central feed bore 14 of a burner. A blanketing shield of fuel is fed through a conduit 18 and envelopes the feed and thereby separates it from an oxygen containing gas fed through a further conduit 22 prior to combustion. By shielding the feed from the oxygen, oxidation of sulfidic sulfur to sulfur dioxide is minimized.

## Description
DEDUCTIVE SMELTING OF SULFIDES AND A BURNER TRERKFOR TECHNICAL FIELD The instant invention relates to the pyronietallurgical processing of metal sulfide ores or concentrates in general and, more particularly, to a more efficient method and burner apparatus that minimize the generation of sulfur dioxide SO2 in a reverberatory smelting vessel. BACKGROUND ART In the course of recovering nickel and or copper from sulfidic materials such as concentrates containing chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, etc. the first pyronietallurgical step is the oxidation of iron which ultimately leads to its extraction via slag removal. This process results in a matte rich in nickel, copper and other desired metallic values. One such smelting method that accomplishes this end utilizes a reverberatory furnance. Briefly, in current reverberatory furnaces, a fossil fuel coal, oil or gas is burned separately from the material being smelted. The furnace is a long rectangular structure with burners arranged at one end. Flames from the burners are played over the bottom of the furnace hearth wherein a large portion of the heat in the combustion gas radiates directly to the charge lying on the hearth below.Simultaneously, a remainder of the heat from the burners is radiated from and reflected off the roof and walls hence it Wreverberatesfl in the furnance. Although quite versatile, reverberatory smelting requires large quantities of fuel and results in the formation of nitrous oxides NO , The charge fed into the furnace is the sulfide containing calcine feed eminating from a roaster. The charge is fed through a series of vertical fettling pipes that pass through the roof and dropped along the sides of the furnace. As it melts, the charge flows into the hearth and forms the characteristic slag and matte. A silicious flux to bind up the ironoxide formed in the roaster is added as necessary.The slag rich in undesirable iron containing compounds floats above the mattte rich in desirable nickel, copper and other metallic compounds .The slag and matte are separated by appropriate tapping procedures for further treatment in convertors. An improved variation on this theme is the oxy fuel reverb furnace. In this embodiment, a plurality of burners, essentially parallel to inner walls are mounted in the roof. Pure oxygen is mixed with the fuel to cause combustion. The resultant flame impinges directly on the charge below. This configuration increases furnace throughput and decreases fuel consumption. The feed is independent of the burners. A great difficulty posed by the pyrometallurgy of sulfide ores is that substantial quantities of sulfur dioxide are liberated as a byproduct. In view of a heightened awareness concerning the release of sulfur dioxide, it has become imperative that sulfur dioxide emissions be subtantially reduced whenever and wherever possible. Accordingly, it is often desirable to produce sulfuric acid as a by product. In any event, it is always desirable to improve furnace throughput, decrease expensive fuel consumption and reduce SO2 emissions. SUMMARY OF TKE I ENTlON Accordingly, there is provided a process and a burner adapted therefor wherein a nickel andlor copper sulfide concentrate is passed through the central bore of a burner extending into a oxy fuel reverberatory furnace and is contacted with a gaseous fuel rather than oxygen prior to combustion. More specifically, the sulfide concentrate may be a mixture of nickel or copper sulfide concentrate and roasted nickel or copper concentrate calcines or it may be partially roasted nickel or copper concentrate. This flame smelting technique minimizes the oxidation of sulfidic sulfur to SO2 in the smelting vessel and improves fuel efficiencies and throughput without being deleterious to the refractories lining the vessel walls. In addition, NO formation is reduced. x BRIEF DESCRIFTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a cross sectional elevation of an embodiment of the invention. Figure 2 is a partial cross sectional view taken along line 2 2 in Figure 1. PREFURED MODE FOR eAlRylNG OUT TEE INVENTION Referring to Figures 1 and 2 there is shown a burner 10 adapted for installation into a reverberatory furnace not shown . The burner 10 includes feed inlet 12. The inlet 12 intersects central bore 14 which extends through the burner 10 to combustion zone 16. Fuel conduit 18 circumscribes the bore 14 and includes inlet 20. Oxygen conduit 22 circumscribes the fuel conduit 18 and includes inlet 24. Cooling jacket 26 circumscribes the oxygen conduit 22. Cooling fluid usually water is introduced through inlet 28 wherein it courses through the jacket 26 before exiting from outlet 30. Mounting plate 32 serves as a mounting surface to affix the burner 10 to the furnace. Inspect ion port 34 permits visual observation of the burner and flame.The burner 10 is ignited in a casual fashion. It is proposed that flame smelting, that is, feeding the sulfide containing calcine material through the burner 10 into the flame increases the smelting efficiency of a reverberatory vessel. In this fashion, the individual particles are wore fully exposed to the high temperature of the flame. The much improved heat transfer conditions permit increased throughput without any detriment to refractory life.Moreover, the fuel itself partially acts as a temperature depressant by decreasing the flame temperature and thus reducing the formation of NO x It should be noted that by simply introducing the feed through the central bore 14 of the burner 10, excessive sulfur elimination as S02 would occur because the feed is not protected from the oxidizing oxygen stream used for combusting the fuel. Therefore, the burner 10 initially reduces the exposure of the feed to the oxygen by channeling the fuel between the oxygen and the feed. The fuel shields and insulates the feed from the oxygen thas minimizing the oxidation of sulfudic sulfur to S02 in the furnace. Protection of the sulfide containing calcine feed is particularly important in those cases in which smelting is preceeded by fluid bed roasting with thAe objective of capturing part of the sulfur of the metal concentrate in a continuous, strong gas stream which can be fed to an acid plant. Minimization of sulfur evolution as SO2 in the smelting vessel permits maximizing sulfur elimination in the roaster. Optimum operating conditions towards this objective are proposed in the roast reduction smelting process described in Canadian Patent 1151430. In this process, the nickel concentrate is partially roasted and the calcine with a reductant are fed to an electric furnace. A sulfur deficient matte all of the Fe and part of the Ni, Cu and Co in the matte are metallized is produced, thus making sulfur elimination during the succeeding converting operation very small. In view of the teaching in the aforesaid Canadian patent partial reduction smelting mattes with only partial metallization ofFe can also be practiced in a reverberatory furnace. Feeding of the partially roasted calcine and reductant through the burner 10 protects both the sulfide feed from excessive sulfur elimination as S02 and the solid reductant. ExNPIES A small pilot plant electrical furnace 5 ft. 1.5 m I.D. X 5 ft. 1.5 m high was modified by removing the electrodes and inserting the burner 10. The feed was projected down the central bore 14 in both tests described hereafter. The results are given in Table I below. InRun 1 the oxygen and fuel were dispatched through conduits 18 and 22 respectively whereas in Run 2 the fuel was injected into conduit 18 and the oxygen was fed into conduit 22. The velocity of the feed and gas are on the order of 20 25 meters second. This results in somewhat of a three ring concentric laminar flow as the various components emerge from the burner 10 into the combustion zone 16. The oxygen, shielded from the feed by the fuel, sees the fuel and is consumed during the resulting combustion reaction before it has the opportunity to oxidize the feed. The close proximity of the feed to the heat generated by the combustion reaction greatly increases the efficiency of the process while reducing the need for fuel.

This shows that injecting the gas or other fuel next to the partially roasted concentrate helped prevent the oxidation of the sulfides by the oxygen used for the combustion and is a superior arrangement to achieve the desired objective. Note also that the combination. of increased coke in the feed through the burner plus the natural gas injection next to it give a superior reduction of the slag, i.e. the nickel in the slag is substanially lower. Thus both the sulfuric sulfur and the coke were protected by the burner 10.
