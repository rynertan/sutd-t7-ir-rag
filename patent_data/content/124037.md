# Method for preparing composite ceramic powder.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for preparing a composite ceramic powder comprising the steps of adding a carbon pow der and an aluminum nitride powder to a methylsilicic acid powder or a precursor of the methylsilicic acid and mixing them and then subjecting the resulting mixed powder to a heat treatment in an atmosphere including an inert gas or a carbon component containing gas in order to coat the aluminum ni tride powder with silicon carbide. This invention permits to obtain a chemically stable com posite ceramic powder and a sintered body obtained by em ploying the composite ceramic powder has a good thermal conductivity.
