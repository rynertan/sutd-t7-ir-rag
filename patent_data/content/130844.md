## Description
The present invention relates to improvements in and relating to an interconnection apparatus for wiring harnesses particularly those in which a large number of branch conductive paths are formed by the arrangement of a busbar and are connected to the cables of a wiring harness to construct desired branch circuits. Wiring harnesses heretofore used for the interior wiring of automobiles require a large number of branch circuits in the midst of the wiring harness and an interconnection apparatus for wiring harnesses hereinafter simply referred to as an interconnection apparatus is known in the art in which the corresponding branch conductive paths to the branch circuits of the wiring harness are concentrically formed on a wiring board by the arrangement of a busbar and the cables of the wiring harness are connected to the branch conductive paths thereby concentrically constructing the desired branch circuits. However in order to ensure the functioning of these branch circuits, e.g., a flasher relay, etc., it is necessary that the control element, e.g. a relay and functional components such as diodes and capacitors required for each branch circuit, are arranged, and their electronic circuit is incorporated, in the branch circuit. Thus, there is a marked tendency toward further increasing the complexity of such electronic circuits. In order to make the interconnection apparatus having these tendencies more compact and smaller in size, the applicant has proposed in Japanese Patent Application No. 57 194851, Laid Open No. 59 83374 , a novel interconnection apparatus comprising in combination a wiring board including the desired branch conductive path group formed by the arrangement of a busbar and a plurality of printed circuit boards having concentrically and densely arranged thereon the required functional component group for the branch circuit group of a wiring harness whereby the printed circuit boards are detachably mounted on the wiring board and the terminals provided at the side edges of the printed circuit boards are cdnnected to the ends of the busbar of the wiring board thereby incorporating and connecting the functional component circuits of the printed circuit boards to the branch conductive paths. An interconnection apparatus according to the pre characterising part of claim 1 is described in US A 4218724. According to the present invention, there is provided an interconnection apparatus for wiring harnesses comprising An embodiment of the present invention enables one to make smaller and more compact an interconnection apparatus of the type including simple circuitry and functional component assembly for two wheeled vehicles, for example. More specifically, the present invention permits a novel construction in which a busbar pattern including branch conductive paths formed by the arrangement of a busbar and a printed wiring pattern including a functional component group arranged densely, and its functional components circuits formed by printed wiring, are formed on a single layer insulating board thereby incorporating and connecting the functional component circuits in the branch conductive paths. Thus, the desired branch conductive path group and functional component circuits are formed on a single layer insulating board and are interconnected thereby making the interconnection apparatus considerably smaller and more compact than previously. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The present inveniton will now be described in a greater detail with reference to an embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figs. 1 to 7 which show this embodiment, an interconnection apparatus of the invention includes a wiring board 1 comprising a single layer insulating board 1 and a cover 2 placed over the wiring board 1. In Fig. 1, the left hand part of the wiring board 1 includes a busbar pattern A including the desired branch conductive path group formed by a busbar 3 and the right hand part includes a printed wiring pattern B including a group of functional components 7 arranged densely on the insulating board 1 and printed conductive paths 15 see Fig. 2 on the back forming the circuits of the functional components 7 by printed wiring. More specifically the busbar 3 of the busbar pattern A forms the desired branch conductive paths on the single layer insulating board 1 and the busbar 3 is provided with downwardly projected mounting pieces 3 which are fitted in mounting holes 16 of the insulating board 1 for positioning the busbar 3 and tab contact members 5 vertically arranged at its end portions. After the mounting of the cover 2 which will be described later, a fuse 11 is fitted on the tab contact members 5 through intermediate terminals 10 and connectors 12 at the end of bundles of cables 13 are fitted on the tab contact members 5. The printed wiring pattern B includes tab terminals 4 and 6 arranged vertically on the insulating board 1 and connected to the printed conductive paths 15 on the back of the insulating board 1 and the tab terminals 4 and 6 are adapted for connection with the connectors 12 to incorporate and connect the functional component circuits provided by the printed conductive paths 15 in the branch circuits of a wiring harness. On the other hand, the printed conductive paths 15 of the functional components 7 associated for example with the fuse are connected to the busbar 3 so that the functional component circuits provided by the printed conductive paths 15 are incorporated and connected to the branch conductive paths of the busbar 3. More specifically, as shown at C in Fig. 1, each tab terminal 4 includes a plate base portion 21, a tab contact portion 20 formed by bending one end of the base portion 21 through 90 , a window 19 cut out of the base portion 21 and a conductive piece 22 provided by forming the cutout material into a leg shape. Also, as shown at D in Fig. 1, each tab terminal 6 includes a plate base portion 21, a tab contact portion 20 and a leg conductive piece 22 which is formed by bending the end of the base portion 21 in the opposite direction through 90 . Each tab terminal 4 or 6 is vertically arranged on the wiring board 1 and the conductive piece 22 is fitted into the mounting hole 16 of the insulating board 1 and soldered at its forward end to the printed conductive path 15 on the back of the insulating board 1 as shown in Fig. 5. The busbar 3 is connected to the printed conductive paths 15 by inserting the mounting pieces 3 projecting downwardly from the side edges of the busbar 3 into the mounting holes 16 of the insulating board 1 and soldering the forward ends of the mounting pieces 3 to the printed conductive paths 15 as shown in Fig. 4. The cover 2 which is placed over the above mentioned wiring board 1, is made of a thin sheet of resin material which is mounted to shield and enclose the busbar 3 and the functional components 7 on the wiring board 1 and thereby insulate and protect them. Arranged on the upper surface of the cover 2 are fuse mounts 8 and connector mounts 9 in frame form and the connector mounts 9 are provided with holes 17 through which are inserted the tab contact portions 5 and the tab contact portions 20 of the tab terminals 4 and 6. Also, a large number of press pieces 14 are arranged at suitable positions on the inner side of the cover 2 so that when the cover 2 is mounted on the wiring board 1, each of the press pieces 14 contacts and presses from above the busbar against the base of a tab contact member 5 or the base portion 21 of a tab terminal 4 or 6 as shown as Fig. 6 or 7. It is to be noted that the cover 2 is adapted to cover the wiring board 1 so as to accommodate its peripheral edges and it is provided, though not shown, with locking pawls or the like on the inner side of the peripheral edges so as to lock the cover 2 in its mounted position and thereby prevent it from being removed easily. Also, if necessary, the cover 2 is provided with a locking mechanism which locks and unlocks the cover 2 as desired. In use of the interconnection apparatus of this invention constructed as described above, after the cover 2 has been mounted, locked and assembled to the wiring board 1, the fuse 11 is fitted in the fose mount 8 through the intermediate terminals 10 and the connectors 12 are connected to the connector mounts 9 thereby forming the desired branch circuit group in the midst of the wiring harness and incorporating and connecting the required functional component circuits in the respective branch circuits. As described hereinabove, by virtue of the fact that both the busbar pattern A and the printed wiring pattern B are formed on the same single layer insulating board 1 and the busbar pattern A and the printed wiring pattern B are interconnected without each requiring such mechanical contact means as terminals, intermediate terminals, etc., the apparatus is greatly reduced in size, made considerably more compact and greatly reduced in weight. By making the apparatus so compact, it is possible to reduce the number of component parts and thereby reduce the cost and improve the quality, reliability, etc. Further, by virtue of the fact that the apparatus includes the press pieces 14 and the tab terminals 4 and 6 which are designed as mentioned previously and the mounting of the cover 2 on the wiring board 1 causes the press pieces 14 to press down the busbar 3 forming the bars of the tab contact members 5 and the base portions 21 of the tab terminals 4 and 6, when the connectors 12 and the fuse 11 fitted on the tab contacts 5 and 20 are removed, the external force due to the removing resistance is borne by the cover 2 which is locked to the wiring board 1 and thus there is no danger of any undesired external force being borne by the tab contact members 5 and the conductive pieces 22 of the tab terminals 4 and 6. As a result, there is no danger of deforming the tab contact members 5 and causing derangement of the busbar 3 and there is no danger of causing damage to the soldered portions of the conductive pieces 22 of the tab terminals 4 and 6 so that their current conducting performance is maintained. From the foregoing description it will be seen that both the branch circuits and the functional component circuits are so simplified and made compact that they are well suited for use for example with two wheeled vehicles.
