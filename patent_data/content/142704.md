# Microtube adapter having a holding and uncapping apparatus.

## Abstract
An adapter 10 for a swinging bucket centrifuge rotor includes a slide plate 52 having a retaining lip 64 and a cam surface 66 thereon. Movement of the plate in one direction to a holding position disposes the lip to hold above the rim R of a microtube T to hold the same in place. Movement in an opposite direction introduces a cam surface between the rim of the tube and a flange F on a closure C to thereby uncap the same.
