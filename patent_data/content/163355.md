## Description
The present invention relates to a static emulsifier for the production of stable mixtures of water, coal and oil. In the present state of the art, no static emulsifiers exist for use for mixtures of coal and oil. It is however known an emulsifying device suitable to produce stable emulsions of water in fuel oil. For the description of such a device we avail ourselves of hereto attached fig. 1. Such a device is constituted by a convergent conical duct 1 , followed by a short length of cmstant section duct 2 ending into a plenum chamber 3 of cylindrical section in communication with a discharge duct 4 . The mixture to be emulsified 5 delivered under pressure to the convergent duct runs, at high speed,through the short duct of constant section and enters then the plenum chamber inside this chamfer the emulsifying of the mixture occurs, the emulsified mixture leaving 6 the device through the discharge duct. The device operates cn the basis of the superimposition of a plurality of physical phenomena whose effect is of notably reducing the size of water drops, thus originating a homogeneous emulsion. Said device is poorly suitable to stabilize mixtures of coal, fuel oil and water. A static equipment suitable to homogenize above all mixtures of coal, oil and water has been found, which allows a stable mixture to be obtained. The equipment which is the object of the present invention comprises a feeding duct in communication with a duct of convergent ore frustum shape, which continues into a duct of constant section, leading to a chamber chamber a whose transversal dimensions are greater than those of the constant section duct, wherein the chamber a has a volume which can be varied as requir ed by means of a movable adjustable bottom and is pro vided in its lateral wall with a set of holes, said holes placing the chamber a in communication with a discharge chamber chamber b annular and coaxial with the chamber a . The angle between the greater base and the lateral surface of the cone frustum shaped duct is preferably comprised between 50 and 700 and more preferably is in the region of 600. The chamber a , plenum chamber1 is preferably cf cy lindrical shape The feeding duct, the convergent cone frustum shaped duct and the constant section duct can be provided in z single metal block or in two or more metal blocks. The diameter of the chamber a and the diameter of the constant section. duct are so selected as to obtain between the inlet of the constant section duct and the chamber a a drop of mixture pressure greater then 3 bar, more preferably of about 5 bar. For slmpleness sake in equipment construction, it can be preferable to select the diameter of the plenum chamber equal to the diameter of the feeding duct. The equipment being the object of the present inven tron shall be now illustrated with reference to hereto attached fig. 2 which represents an embodiment thereof, which is not tQ be considered as a limitation of the in vention. The mixture of coal, oil and water 1 enters, delivered under pressure, the equipment, runs through the feed ign duct 2 , then through the convergent cone frustum shaped duct 3 , subsequently at high speed through the duct of constant section 4 , and penetrates then into the chamber 5 chamber a , called plenum chamber, of cylindrical shape with movable adjustable bottom 6 , go ing to collide with the Jame bottom of said chamber. Because of the collision of the mixture with the bottom of the chamber a fine suddivision occurs of the components of the mixture, the homogenizing of the same mixture being thus obtained. The mixture, after having been homogenized, passes from the plenum chamber through a plurality of holes 7 uniformly distributed in te later al wall 8 of said chamber into the discharge chamber 9 annular and coaxial to the said plenum chamber and leaves 10 the device. The discharge chamber is bounded by the outer wall of the plenum chamber and by a cylindrical manifold 11 .The feeding duct, the cone frustum shaped duct and the duct of corstant section are made in two blocks 12 and 13 . The movable adjustable bottom allows the length and obviously the volume of the plenum chamber to be varied above all on the basis of the flow rate and of the composition of the mixture. There is schematically shown with 14 a nut for the locking of the movable bottom of the plenum chamDer, with 15 the angle comprised between the major base and the lateral wall of the cone frustum shaped duct. An example is now reported having the purpose of illustrating the use of the equipment which is the object of the invention. Example A coal has been ground down to the following granulometry 100 100 mesh 80 200 mesh 40 325 mesh The ground coal has been mixed first with an amount of water of about 22.2 by weight relatively to the coal and then with heavy fuel oil the mixture formed has been homogenized by stabilization in the equipment described in fig. 2. The most representative dimensions of the equipment are diameter of the constant section duct 2 mm length of the constant section duct 10 mm diameter of cone frustum shaped duct major base 12,4 mm length of the eone frustun shaped duct 3 mm diameter of the holes 5 mm length of the plenum chamber 35 mm diameter of the plenum chamber 15 mm angle between the major base and the lateral wall of the cone frustum shaped duct 60 The diameter of the plenum chamber and the diameter of the constant section duct have been so selected, as to obtain Ã¢ 5 bar drop in mixture pressure between the inlet of the constant section duct and the plenum chamber. A stable mixture with the following composition has been obtained fuel oil 45 by weight coal 45 by weight water 10 by weight
