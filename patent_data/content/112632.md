# Use of 8 substituted guanine derivatives in the manufacture of a medicament.

## Abstract
Compositions and methods for their use in modulating animal cellular responses are disclosed. The compositions include as an active agent an effective amount of an 8 sub stituted guanine derivative bonded 9 1 to an aldose having 5 or 6 carbon atoms in the aldose chain. The composition in cludes a diluent amount of a physiologically tolerable car rier. The guanine derivative is free of electrically charged functionality, while the 8 substituent has an electron with drawing inductive effect greater than that of hydrogen and contains fewer than about 15 atoms. Animal cellular re ponses are modulated by contacting the cells with a com position of this invention.
