## Description
PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR PREPARING 11 ALKOXY AND ALKYLMERCAPTO 3 OXOALKYL 2,6 METHANO 3 BENZAZOCINESt DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3 R1 7 , 8 , 9 or 10 hydroxy 11 ax R3 6 eq R4 11 eq CH2CH2CO CH2 n X Alk 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydro 2,6 methano 3 benzazocines having the formula EMI1.1 where R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl lower alkyl, phenyl lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or lower alkynyl three ofR2, R2 , R2 and R2 are hydrogen and the fourth is hydroxy R3 and R4 are each hydrogen or lower alkyl, or R3 and R4 together are divalent lower alkylene, ICH2 Z, where m is one of the integers 3 and 4 n is one of the integers 2 4 X is oxygen or sulfur O or S and Alk is lower alkyl, and is an improvement in the process described in Belgian Patent 864,950. As used herein, the term lower alkyl means saturated, acyclic groups which may be straight or branched containing from one to about seven carbon atoms as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl or heptyl. As used herein, the terms lower alkenyl and lower alkynyl mean monovalent groups of from three to seven carbon atoms containing one double or triple bond as illustrated for example, by 2 propenyl, 2 butenyl, 4 pentenyl, 3 methyl 2 butenyl, 1 methyl 2 propenyl, 2 methyl 2 propenyl, 2 propynyl, 2 butynyl, 4 pentynyl, 2 hexynyl and the like. As used herein, the term cycloalkyl means saturated carbocyclic groups containing from three to seven ring carbon atoms as illustrated, for example, by cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 2 methylcyclobutyl, 4 ethylcyclohexyl and the like. According to the process of the present invention, the compounds of Formula I are prepared by heating, in an acid medium, for example with formic acid either alone or in an organic solvent, for example toluene, xylene or mesitylene, at a temperature from 100 150 C., or with a benzyldi lower alkylammonium formate or a tri lower alkylammonium formate at a temperature from 120 1500C., a lower alkyl 1R1 3 Alk X CH2 n CO 4a alpha R3 5 alpha R4 6 , 7 , 8 or 9 methoxy methoxy 1,2,3,4,4a,5,10,10a octahydro 2,5 methanobenzo oc quinoline 3 carboxylate having the formula EMI2.1 where three of R2, R21, R2 and R2 are hydrogen and the fourth is methoxymethoxy R1, R3, R4, n, X and Alk have the meanings given above and Alk is lower alkyl. Under the acid conditions present during the heating of the compounds of Formula II in formic acid or formate solution, the compounds of Formula I where one of R2, R2 , R211 and R2. is hydroxy are produced from the compounds of Formula II where the corresponding group is m2thDymeflxey CH3ocH2O by simultaneous ring opening of the compounds of Formula II between the 2 and 3 carbon atoms, decarbalkoxylation of the resulting 2,6 methano 3 benzazocine moiety and cleavage of the methoxymethoxy group. The above described process for the preparation of the compounds of Formula I via the compounds of Formula II represents a substantial improvement over the known process for preparing the compounds of Formula I described inBelgian Patent 864,950, because the present process combines in one step, i.e. the ring opening decarbalkoxylation and simultaneous ether cleavage, the conversion of the compounds of Formula II to the compounds of Formula I, whereas according to the known process, compounds corresponding to FormulaII where three of R2, R2 , R2 , and R21 are hydrogen and the fourth is lower alkoxy are heated in an acid medium to effect ring opening decarbalkoxylation to the corresponding ethers corresponding to Formula I which are then cleaved in a separate step to the corresponding hydroxy compounds i.e. the compounds where three of R2, R2 , R2 and are hydrogen and the fourth is hydroxy . The starting compounds of Formula II wherein one of the indicated radicals is methoxymethoxy are readily obtained by the process described above from the corresponding hydroxy compound. The related lower alkoxy substituted starting materials employed in the prior art reaction are obtained from the corresponding hydrcxy substituted compound by the Williamson synthesis, which process is no more efficient and probably less efficient than the process for obtaining the methoxymethoxy compound. The compounds of Formula II where one of R2 R2 R2 and R2 11 is methoxymethoxy are prepared by reaction of the corresponding compounds where the subject group is hydroxy with dimethoxymethane in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid in an inert organic solvent. The reaction is carried out by refluxing a solution of the reactants in the chosen solvent, for example chloroform, methylene dichlotide, ethylene dichloride and the like, under a Soxhlet extractor containing molecular sieves having a pore size sufficient to trap and hold molecules of methanol.In this way the methanol produced in the reversible reaction is removed from the reaction mixture as it is formed, and the reaction proceeds to completion. It has been found that 4A molecular sieves have a porosity of the proper size for this purpose. The compounds of Formula II where one of R2, R2 , R211 and R, is methoxymethoxy are particularly useful as intermediates for preparing the compounds of Formula t where the subject group is hydroxy and which contain acid sensitive groups elsewhere in the molecule, for example the compounds of Formula I where R1 is cycloalkyl lower alkyl where cycloalkyl is cyclopropyl, since as indicated above the med m2thDxy group is readily cleaved under mild acid conditions. The compounds of Formula II are prepared according to the procedure described in U.S. Patent 4,119,628 which comprises reacting a lower alkyl l R1 4aa R3 5a R4 6 , 7 , 8 or 9 methoxymethoxy l,2,3,4,4a,51l0110a octa hydro 2 , 5 methanobenzo g guinoline 3 carboxylate having the formula EMI4.1 where three of R2, R2 , R2 and R2 are hydrogen and the fourth is methoxymethoxy and R1, R3, R4 and Alk have the meanings given above with an alkali metal amide, and reacting the resulting alkali metal salt with an appropriate acid halide, Alk X CH2 n CO Hal, where Alk, X and n have the meanings given above, and Hal is halogen. The compounds of Formula III and the method for their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,100,164. Due to the presence of a basic amino grouping, the free base form represented by Formula I above reacts with organic and inorganic acids to form acid addition salts.The acid addition salt forms are prepared from any organic or inorganic acid. They are obtained in conventional fashion, for instance either by direct mixing of the base With the acid or, when this is not appropiate, by dissolving either or both of the base and the acid separately in water or an organic solvent and mixing the two solutions, or by dissolving both the base and the acid together in a solvent.The resulting acid addition salt is isolated by filtration, if it is insoluble in the reaction medium, or by evaporation of the reaction medium to leave the acid addition salt as a residue. The acid moieties or anions in these salt forms are in themselves neither novel nor critical and therefore can be any acid anion or acid like substance capable of salt formation with the base. Representative acids for the formation of the acid addition salts include formic acid, acetic acid, isobutyric acid, alpha mercaptopropionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, succinamic acid, tannic acid, glutamic acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, pyromucic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, gluconic acid, saccharic acid, ascorbic acid, penicillin, benzoic acid, phthalic acid, salicylic acid, 3,5dinitrobenzoic acid, anthranilic acid, cholic acid, 2 pyridinecarboxylic acid, pamoic acid, 3 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, picric acid, quinic acid, tropic acid, 3 indoleacetic acid, barbituric acid, sulfamic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, isethionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, butylarsonic acid, methanephosphonic acid, acidic resins, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, arsenic acid, and the like. The compounds of Formula I can exist in enantiomeric forms separable into enantiomers. If desired, the isolation or the production of a particular enantiomeric form can be accomplished by application of general principles known in the prior art. In the nomenclature employed for the compounds of Formula I herein, ax stands for axial and eq for equatorial, and the configurations are given with reference to the hydroaromatic ring. Thus, the 6tes , 11 ax substituents of Formula I are in the cis configuration, whereas the 6 eq , ll eq substituentsare in the trans configuration. In the nomenclature employed for the compounds of Formulas II and III, again configurations are given with reference to the hydroaromatic ring, and the designation ss indicates the cis configuration relative to the 2,5 methano bridge of the compounds of Formulas II and III. nConversely, the designation cur indicates the trans confi guration relative to the same group. In standard pharmacological test procedures, the compounds of Formula I and the acid addition salts thereof have been found useful as depressants of the central ner vous system, and more particularly have been found useful as analgesics and as antagonists of strong analgesics such as phenazocine, meperidine and morphine. The compounds of Formula I can be administered in the same manner as known analgesics and antagonists of strong analgesics, i.e. parenterally or orally in any of the conventional pharmaceutical forms, as for instance so lutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, and the like. The useful properties of the compounds of Formula I were demonstrated by standard pharmacological procedures readily carried out by technicians having ordinary skill in pharmacological test procedures, so that the actual de termination of numerical biological data definitive for a particular test compound can be ascertained without the need for any extensive experimentation. The test procedures used to detemine analgesic and analgesic antagonist activities of the cpppOunds of Formula I have been described in detail in the prior art and are as follows The acetylcholine induced abdominal constriction test, which is a primary analgesic screening test designed to measure the ability of a test agent to suppress acetylcholine in duced abdominal constriction in mice, described by Collier et al., Brit.

Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 143, 141 1964 . The structures of the compounds of Formula I were established by the mode of synthesis, by elementary analyses and by mass, infrared and nuclear mangetic resonance spectra. The course of reactions and homogeneity of the products were ascertained by thin layer chromatography.
