# Video signal emphasis circuit.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a circuit for emphasizing a video signal e₁ in the vertical direction of a television picture for minimizing noise appearing during reproduction. In the circuit, a signal obtained by delaying an input video signal e₁ by one horizontal scanning period 1H is positively fed back through a feedback circuit 2, 3 to the input of the input video signal. An amplitude difference signal e₄ between the video signal e₂ after being fed back through a positive feedback loop and the delayed video signal e₃ is produced and added 7 to the input video signal e₁ to provide an output video signal e₀ .
