# Reconstituted tobacco smoking material and method for its production.

## Abstract
A method for employing tobacco dust in the prepara tion of reconstituted tobacco, by a paper making process comprises mixing tobacco dust with a bonding material to form a mixture, treating the mixture to form agglomerated particles, mixing the agglomerated particles with a tobacco parts slurry, forming the slurry into a sheet by means of a paper making process, and drying and shredding the resul tant reconstituted tobacco sheet. The bonding material may be a film forming material, a cross linking agent or a cal cium sequestering agent. The smoking material obtained by such method may be mixed with natural leaf tobacco.
