## Description
The invention relates to an apparatus for simul taneously encapsulating a plurality of electronic com ponents which are fastened by their connection points to the conductors of a strip which is subsequently to be divided into separate parts, said apparatus consisting of a heatable mould comprising a top half and a bottom half and being adapted to receive at least one strip contain ing one or more electronic components, and further con sisting of an injection unit which is placed along the long side of the mould and has a plurality of hydraul ically controllable plungers adapted to be moved towards and away from the mould cavity sprues leading into the side wall of the mould, a number of chambers for receiv ing pellets of the plastics material used for the encap sulation, the number of chambers being equal to the num ber of plungers and said chambers being situated between the plungers in their retracted position and plunger cavities, corresponding to the diameter of the plungers, in the mould. An apparatus of this kind is described in Dutch Patent Application No. 8205253. According to this patent application the encapsulation of the electronic com ponents placed in a mould is first effected with the aid of injection means connected to the side edge of the mould and consisting of hydraulic cylinders which operate separately for each mould cavity and which when operated press a pellet or pill of plastics material, preheated in any manner, into the mould cavity. It is thus already known herefrom to use a separate plunger for each pellet, which is of great importance because the advantage over the prior art is now achieved that the pellets do not need to have accurate dimensions. The differences in dimensions of pellets are now compensated by the sprue, which because of its lateral action is Electronic components, particularly integrated circuits, are generally soldered to the conductors of the strip with the aid of particularly thin gold wires. The encapsulation with plastics material must be effected in such a manner that the connections are not broken, that is to say the gold wires must not be broken or detached from the soldered joint by the liquid plastics material flowing at high speed. A hydraulic pressure cylinder presses the liquefied plastics material under pressure, and consequently at varying speed, into the mould cavity, which may give rise to the breaking of con nections. The invention seeks to provide an apparatus with which this shortcoming does not occur. According to the invention this aim is achieved in that each plunger is mounted for sliding in a carrier frame which in turn is adapted to be moved away from and towards the mould by means of a mechanism which is adap ted to move the carrier frame at a controlled speed that each plunger is connected to a pressure means adapted to exert a constant pressure on the plunger that each plun ger has a heating element, and that each plunger carries a signal means and that all the signal means of all the plungers are connected to the operating circuit of the driving mechanism, in such a manner that on the softening of the pellets subjected to pressure and heated by the plungers the driving mechanism moves the frame towards the mould as soon as all the signal means have operated. It is thereby ensured that all the plungers as sociated with the various pellets can be placed under a relatively light pressure with the aid of the plungers heated by the heating element. As soon as a pellet is now softened the respective plunger will move slightly through the action of the pressure applied to it, and thereby close a signal means, such as an electronic con tact. When all the signal means have given the signal, thereby indicating that all the pellets have reached the desired temperature, that is to say have been softened, the carrier frame of the plungers moves towards the mould at a predetermined and naturally controllable speed, for example a constant speed, so that all the mould cavities can likewise be filled at a controllable speed of flow. The driving mechanism used may be a hydraulic driving mechanism, such as hydraulic cylinders, because when a controlled volume flow is provided the movement of the piston in the cylinder is possible at for example a controlled optionally constant speed. The plungers may each be coupled to a hydraulic operating cylinder. These cylinders are connected to a hydraulic circuit whose pressure can be brought to two preadjustable levels by means of hydraulic pressure controllers, this circuit including if necessary an accumulator and containing a gaseous medium under pressure. These controllers then supply the force for applying the heated plungers against the pellets and thus ensure the application of pressure. The invention will now be explained more fully with the aid of the drawings. The drawings show a mould comprising a top half 1 and a bottom half 2, between which are formed a row of mould cavities 3 with sprues 4 and a plunger cavity 5. Next to the mould is disposed a strip 6 having chambers 7 for holding pellets 8. At 9 is situated a horizontally movable carrier frame which is coupled to two hydraulic cylinders 10. This carrier frame carries a number of plungers 11, which at 12 are guided for sliding in the frame and which are provided with a head 13 whose diameter is such that this head will fit accuraterly into the plunger cavity 5 of the mould. Each head is provided with a heating element 14. In the frame 9 are fastened hydraulic cylinders 15 which are connected to a circuit 16 under constant pressure, the piston rods 17 of said cylinders lying at 18 against the plungers 11. Each plunger carries a contact 19 cooperating with a counter contact 20. Instead of the signal device consisting of these contacts, other signal means are also conceivable. Figure 2 shows the starting position in which the mould 1, 2 is closed and a pellet 8 is disposed in front of each opening 5. The carrier frame 9 is now moved with the aid of the cylinders 10 from the position shown in Figure 2 to the position shown in Figure 3, in which the heads 13 of the plungers 11 have entered the plunger cavities 5 and have thus pushed the pellets 8 in front of them and pressed them into the plunger cavity as a consequence of this movement the plungers have been slightly pressed back, that is to say the hydraulic circuit 15, 16 has been slightly tensioned so that the distance indicated at 21 in Figure 3 is formed between the contacts 19 and 20. After adequate heating of the switched on heating element 14 in each head 13 the respective plunger will slide further into the plunger cavity 5, because the pel let will have been softened by the heat. This condition is shown in Figure 4, and has the consequence that the contacts 19, 20 are closed. When all the contacts have now been closed, which will occur more or less simultaneously, the hydraulic cylinders 15 are brought to a higher controlled pressure, so that the carrier frame 9 slides further in the direc tion of the mould, while the heads 13 of the plungers now penetrate as far as possible into the plunger cavities 5 and press the plastics material into the mould. Since each plunger is subjected to pressure be forehand and gives the signal only when the pellets are sufficiently heated, differences in the volumes of the pellets are no longer of importance. Since the carrier frame moves all the plungers simultaneously at a predetermined controllable speed, the filling is effected in the required careful manner. The stroke of the cylinders 10 can be accurately limited, because before the carrier frame is moved for the purpose of filling the mould cavities, each plunger has already been brought into a position which takes into account any slightly different dimensions of the pellets in relation to one another. In view of the ready flowability of the plastics material once it has been melted, it may in this connec tion be sufficient to do nothing in respect of the pres sure of the hydraulic circuit 15, 16 acting on the plun gers. If however it is desired to achieve a fixed loca tion for the position assumed by the plungers before they press the plastics material into the mould cavity, this can be done by increasing the level of the pressure at the moment when all the signal devices give the desired signal to the cylinders 10. Instead of the cylinders 10, any other mechanism which can ensure a controlled speed may be used, for example a threaded spindle mechanism driven by an elec tric motor. The side view shown in Figure 6 of the strip 6, which is shown in top plan view in Figure 1, with the chambers 7 for the pellets 8, enables it to be seen that the chambers are formed by recesses 21 which are open at the top and have a cylindrical bottom 22. The width of this strip, which resembles a toothed rack, corresponds to the horizontal thickness, shown in this Figure, of the pellets 8 viewed in the direction of the transverse axis of the recess 7. Between the recesses 21 this strip has inclined surfaces 23. At 24 is shown a magazine provided with a discharge passage 25 containing cylindrical pellets 8 one above the other. The strip 6 is movable from the position shown to the right in Figure 6, as indicated by the arrow 26. The recesses 21 are then filled one by one with pellets. On further movement in the direction of the arrow 26 the strip then reaches the position shown in Figure 1. The magazine is then locked. After the injection of the plastics material into the mould cavities, the strip moves back towards the maga zine for refilling.
