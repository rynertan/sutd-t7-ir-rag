# Process and catalyst for the conversion of oils that contain carbon precursors and heavy metals.

## Abstract
An improved process and catalyst for economically converting carbo metallic oils to lighter products. This process is practiced in accordance with effective metals management, carbon management and catalyst activity management combined with feed atomization vaporization, efficient stripping of carbonaceous material from the coked catalyst, exothermic and endothermic removal of hydrocar bonaceous material to effectively maintain the RCC unit in heat balance. This reduced crude cracking process is prac ticed with a new and improved catalyst composition identi fied as RCCC 1 Special that is characterized by the following composition at least 30 wt rare earth exchanged Y faujasite crystalline zeolite with a silica to alumina ratio of at least 5 of a high lanthanum to cerium ratio and residual sodium content less than 0.30 wt , is provided with a pore volume greater that 0.35 cc gm and comprises a clay matrix material that may or may not be acidic with pore size openings in the range of 500 to 2,000 angstroms. The RCCC 1 Special can contain metal promoters to catalyze the en dothermic removal of coke and the partial removal of hydrogen present in the carbonaceous material with carbon dioxide. In addition, metal additives to passivate and immo bilize vanadium is comtemplated.
