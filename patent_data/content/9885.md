# Method for applying coatings to substrates.

## Abstract
A process for producing coated substrates having con trollable surface texture. The coating composition is depo sited on a carrying web 200 to which the coating will not adhere e.g. polyester film . The substrate 100 to be coated e.g. paper is subsequently brought into contact with the coated web material and the laminate 201 passed through a curing station 7 where the coating composition is polymer ized and cured. Upon removal from the curing station the substrate with the coating adhering to it can be released from the carrying web. The web can, if desired, be reused in the process.
