# Cylindrical grinding machine.

## Abstract
A cylindrical grinder 10 is disclosed for effecting stock removal from a cam surface 14 on a workpiece 12 , the cam surface including portions having differing radii of curvature and being disposed at differing distances from the axis of rotation of the cam. Means are provided for defining a selected velocity profile for each revolution of the cam, the velocity profile having a plurality of acceleration deceleration segments whereby the velocity of the surface of the cam at the grinding location is selectively varied. Stock removal means are also provided, which includes a grinding wheel and grinding wheel feed control means. The grinding wheel feed control means includes a Rough Feed Control having means for infeeding the grinding wheel at a plurality of sequentially operable feeds, a Finish Feed Control having means for infeeding the grinding wheel at a plurality of sequentially operable feeds, a Selected Point Sensor for sensing the presence of a selected point on the cam surface at a predetermined angular location, a Grinding Wheel Feed Control for actuating one of the Rough and Finish Feed Controls at the first of the plurality of feeds when the selected point is sensed and for sequentially actuating each of the remaining plurality of feeds when the selected point is sensed each of the next remainder of the same plurality of revolutions.
