# Monitoring arrangement for a gas turbine spark ignition system.

## Abstract
The monitoring arrangement is used with a spark ignition system 10, 13 in which the spark discharge current oscillates at a known frequency, and includes a sonic sensor 30 accoustically coupled to the spark igniter 13 , a detector cir cuit 33, 35, 37, 38 responsive only to signals from the sensor 30 which have a frequency substantially equal to that of the spark discharge current, and an indicating device 43 respon sive to an output signal from the detector circuit 33, 35, 37, 38 .
