# Glass melting furnaces.

## Abstract
In a glass melting furnace 10 , electrodes 30, 130, 130 and other devices may be protected from degrada tion by oxygen above an oxidation temperature thereof by immersion into the glass 12, 112 . In such a glass melting furnace 10 , electrodes 30, 130, 130 are in serted through the batch 20, 120 in symmetrical lo cations spaced from sidewalls 14, 114 of the furnace 10 . Melting and refining takes place in relatively narrow bands below the batch 20, 120 .
