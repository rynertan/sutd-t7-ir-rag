# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A VALVE AND LID ASSEMBLY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LATTER

## Abstract
A process for producing a valve and lid assembly con sisting essentially of a lid and a valve body, comprises the steps of A producing, in finished condition, the said lid with a collar portion having a shoulder or a rim about a central opening, B producing separately, in finished condition, the said valve body having an upper body portion preferably bearing a dowel portion, and on the latter a valve stem bearing at its free end a valve head of enlarged diameter, C mounting the valve body on the mandrel of a piston movable in a pressure cylinder aligned with the central axis of the valve and lid assembly, or placing it loosely in said collar portion above said central opening, D striking the mandrel with sufficient force, e.g. preferably 15 to 25 kilopond, to drive the same together with the valve body abruptly through the collar portion of the lid and to pass the valve head out of the said central opening with stretching or bending the valve stem or an adjacent part of the valve body, so that, upon withdrawel of the mandrel, a rearward face of the valve head sealingly engages the shoulder or rim about the central opening The self closing valve and lid assembly which can be produced by this process is adapted for closing the open top end of the interior of a container fillable with pressurized product and comprises a lid having a dome part and a collar portion on the latter, as well as a valve body mounted in the hollow interior of the dome part and being of elastically flexible material. The valve body has a head bearing an annular contact zone which sealingly engages a similar contact zone on an annular indentation or inner annular shoulder of the dome part. One of the annular contact zones of the inner wall surface of the dome part and of the valve head is located in a conically tapered surface on one of the two last mentioned parts with the central assembly axis as cone axis, and the other annular contact zone is a substantially circular edge on the other one of the two last mentioned parts, opposite the said conically tapered surface.
