## Description
This invention relates to a numerical control method comprising specifying a three dimensional curve of an article to be machined and, more particularly but not exclusively, to a method of specifying a three dimensional curve that is ideal for the creation of an NC tape required for the numerically controlled machining of a three dimensional metal mold or the like. A curved surface of a three dimensional metal mold or the like on a design drawing is generally expressed by a plurality of section curves, but no profile data is shown for the shape of the area lying between a certain section curve and the next adjacent section curve. In numerically controlled machining it is essential that machining be carried out so as to smoothly connect these two section curves despite the fact that the profile between them is not given. In other words, this means that machining must be performed by generating the curved surface between the two section curves from such data as that indicative of the section curves, recording on an NC tape the data concerning the generated curved surface, and carrying out machining in accordance with commands from the NC tape. To this end, the applicant has proposed in U.S. Serial No. 266,284 see Japanese Patent Application No. 55 78247 , and has put into practice, a method of creating curved surfaces, comprising generating a plurality of intermediate sections and finding a section curve intermediate section curve on a curved body, based on the intermediate sections, in accordance with predetermined rules, from section data specifying given sections of a three dimensional curved body and from data specifying section curves in said sections, and generating the curved surface of the three dimensional body based on the plurality of generated intermediate section curves. This prior art method will be described with reference to Fig. 1. The method includes giving section curves 11a, 12a in two sections 11, 12 and a reference curve 21a in a reference section 21, moving the first section curve 11a of the two given section curves 11a, 12a along the reference curve 21a while the curve is being transformed so as to be superposed on the second section curve 12a, and creating a curved surface, which is formed owing to said movement, as an assemblage of a plurality of intermediate section curves. In generating the intermediate section curves, the first and second section curves 11a, 12a are brought into uniform correspondence with each other in their entirety. Specifically, when each of the section curves is partitioned into M segments, i th i 1, 2, ... partition points P However, since the prior art method is adapted to generate a curved surface by giving the reference curve 21a in the reference section a plane , curved surface generation cannot be performed in a case where a reference curve 31a is a three dimensional curve, as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, numerals 11, 12 denote sections, 11a, 12a section curves, 41 an intermediate section, and 41a an intermediate section curve. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a three dimensional curve specifying method whereby a three dimensional curve can be specified in a simple manner, and which is well suited for application to curved surface generation in cases where a reference curve is a three dimensional curve. According to the present invention there is provided a numerical control method comprising specifying a three dimensional curve of an article to be machined, by the steps of entering data specifying first and second curves which are the projections of the three dimensional curve onto two mutually orthogonal planes e.g., an XY plane and a YZ plane in a rectangular coordinate system, partitioning the first curve into a number of line segments and finding coordinate values a Fig. 1 is a view for describing a conventional method, Fig. 2 shows an example of a three dimensional curved surface and is useful in describing a drawback of the conventional method, Fig. 3 is a view for describing the outline of the present invention, Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a three dimensional curve generating apparatus for practicing the method of the present invention, Fig. 5 is a flowchart of processing for generating a three dimensional curve according to the present invention, and Fig. 6 is a view for describing a method of specifying a curve in a plane. Processing for specifying a three dimensional curve according to the present invention is broadly classified into the following processes a d , with reference being had to Fig. 3 Each of the foregoing process steps will now be described in conjunction with Fig. 3, a block diagram of a three dimensional curve creating apparatus shown in Fig. 4, and a processing flowchart shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 4, numeral 101 denotes a keyboard, 102 a three dimensional curve generating apparatus, and 103 a curved surface generating unit which receives created three dimensional curve data as an input. The three dimensional curve generating apparatus 102 includes a RAM 102a, processor 102b, a ROM 102c, a working memory 102d, and a data memory 102e for storing three dimensional curve data.
