# Improvements in or relating to composite materials.

## Abstract
The invention relates to composite materials containing immobilized biological active species. A method for the preparation of a composite material containing an immobilized biological active species is dis closed. In carrying out the method a gel precursor containing a particulate biologically active species is applied to a support material and gelled to form a composite material comprising a support material, a permeable gel and, immo bilized in the gel a particulate biologicallt active species. The rheological properties of the gel precursor are selected to facilitate the application to the support material. The rheolo gical properties are also selected to facilitate retention of the gel precursor on the support material prior to and during the gelling, and or to inhibit the sedimentation of biologically active species prior to, and during gelling. At least some of the permeable gel is enmeshed with the support material.
