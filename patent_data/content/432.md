# A process for effecting catalytic isomerization of monocyclic methyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbon compounds.

## Abstract
A process for vapour phase catalytic isomerization of monocyclic methyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbon compounds of from 8 to 10 carbon atoms contained in a feedstock also containing ethylbenzene. The catalyst for the process comprises a zeolite having a constraint index of 1 to 12. The improvement in the process comprises treating the catalyst with one or more basic nitrogen compounds or precursors thereof.
