# Electronic flash apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a light source apparatus which compri ses a flash discharge tube 258 , a switching element 262 connected in series with the flash discharge tube 258 ,a light receiving circuit 100, 132, 134, 136 for photo electrically converting light reflected by a foreground subject to produce a signal corresponding to the dose of light emitted from the flash discharge tube 258 and decision circuit 140, 244, 246, 260 for producing an interruption signal for rendering the switching element 262 non conductive according to the output signal of the light receiving circuit 100, 132, 134, 136 . In the light source apparatus a correction circuit 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 124, 126, 128, 130, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216, 218, 220, 222 for producing a correction signal in accordance with a preset film sensitivity is further comprised, the light receiving circuit 100, 132, 134, 136 photoelectri cally converts light reflected by the foreground subject according to the output signal of the correction circuit and the decision circuit 140, 244, 246, 260 produces the interruption signal when the difference between the output signals of the correction circuit and light receiving circuit is reduced to zero.
