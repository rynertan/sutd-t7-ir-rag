# Freewheel mechanism.

## Abstract
In a freewheel mechanism with a number of blocking members 11 arranged between raceways on two elements 9, 10 , one raceway is arranged on a body 12 which is co operating with one of the elements 9 and is turnable thereon. The circumference of the body 12 is variable for varying the distance between the raceways. The variations can take place because the body 12 is elastically deform able radially and by tightening and releasing a threaded portion between the body 12 and the element 9 , the thread flanks thereby acting as wedges. The purpose of the arrangement is to avoid jamming of the freewheel by the blocking members upon reversal of the direction of rotation when the blocking members and in blocking position. The unwanted torque developed during jamming of the free wheel releases the tightened thread joint between the body 12 and the element 9 , whereby the circumference of the body 12 and the distance between the raceways of the freewheel is increased so that the blocking members 11 are released.
