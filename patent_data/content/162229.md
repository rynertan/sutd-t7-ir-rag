# Preformed polyurethane roadway marking strip which is highly conformant to road surface roughness.

## Abstract
A roadway marking material is described of the pre formed strip type. Said roadway marking strip material sub stantially comprises a polyurethane resin layer or film and an adhesive film associated therewith. The main polyure thane layer is of a composition selected so as to be suffi ciently wear resistent in conjunction with the adhesive layer , and to accomodate anti skid elements and elements capable of enhancing the marking capability of the material, such as light reflecting or catadioptric elements, pigments and fillers. More particularly, the polyurethane layer is selected to have properties of high elongation, high permanent deformation, high tearing resistence and low elastic return. The relatively adhesive film has the function to attach the marking strip to the roadway surface, and, at the same time, to contribute to overall traffic wear resistence of the strip material to gether with the polyurethane film. It has been found in the novel road marking strip material the polyurethane resin layer if appropriately chosen is ca pable of functionally replacing the composite structures of the prior art consisting of a supporting layer of calendered elastomer and a top anti wear layer more particularly the polyurethane layer of the novel structure due to its intrinsic mechanical properties can supply the required support func tion without having to use a special support layer of calen dered elastomer. The required thickness of the polyurethane layer of the novel structure, while providing both the support and the anti wear and marking function, can be considerably less than that of the calendered elastomer layer of the prior art structures, whereby the road marking strip material can be manufactured with significantly reduced overall thickness and hence increased conformance to road surface irregular ities. The adhesive film can either be a self adhesive film or a heat respondant adhesive material. In both cases, the novel road marking material, due to its overall consistency, is read ily removable and therefore, apart from being useful for per manent road markings of high service life, is also particularly adapted for temporary application such as in connection with temporary deviations or detours.
