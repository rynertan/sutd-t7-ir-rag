# Optical fibre splicing.

## Abstract
Apparatus for locally abstracting light from the core of a buffer coated optical fibre, especially a buffer coated single mode optical fibre, suitable for use when monitoring the fusion splicing of optical fibres comprises a body 31 of perspex having at least three faces, an arcuate contact face 32 adapted to bear against a smoothly curved length of buffer coated optical fibre F, an exit face 33 through which light entering the body through the contact face can emerge and a reflecting face 34 which will reflect light entering the body through the contact face in a direction towards the exit face. Light emerging from the smoothly curved length of buffer coated optical fibre and passing through the contact face 32 into the body 31 will be directed and reflected towards the exit face 33 from where it can pass into a light detector P.
