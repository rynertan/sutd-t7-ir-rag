# Fuel controller for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In a fuel controller which comprises a venturi portion 4 formed in an air intake path 2 adapted to feed air to an inter nal combustion engine a throttle valve 3 installed on the downstream side of the venturi portion an auxiliary throttle valve 10 and a fuel injection portion 11 provided between the throttle valve and the venturi portion a bypass air path 5 opened at the venturi portion and at the upstream side thereof a hot wire type air flow sensor 6 provided in the bypass air path for detecting an amount of air passing therethrough and a proportional electromagnetic device 27 which controls the amount of air passing through the bypass air path at a constant level with an air needle valve provided therein and which con trols an amount of fuel passing through a fuel path correspond ing to an amount of air passing through the air intake path with a fuel needle valve provided in the fuel path communicating with the fuel injection portion, the auxiliary throttle valve and the throttle valve are operated interlockedly through a link me chanism 15 .
