# Distillation apparatus.

## Abstract
Distillation apparatus which comprises first and second distillation columns 2 and 16 a compressor 27 and first and second heat exchange means 5 and 19 means for supplying a feed to about the mid point of the first distillation column 2 means for passing a portion of the bottoms from the first distillation column 2 to towards the top of the second distillation column 16 means for circulating a portion of the bottoms from the first distillation column 2 to one side of the first heat exchange means 5 means for circulating bottoms from the second distillation column 16 to one side of the second heat exchange means 19 means for passing an overhead from the second distillation column 16 to towards the bottom of the first distillation column 2 means for removing a high boiling component from the bottom of the second distillation column 16 means for removing, as purified product, an overhead from the first distillation column 2 means for circulating an overhead from the first distillation column 2 , via the compressor 27 , to the other side of the first heat exchange means 5 and means for supplying hot water or steam to the other side of the second heat exchange means 19 .
