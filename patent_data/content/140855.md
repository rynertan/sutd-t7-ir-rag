## Abstract
Method and arrangement for varying a d.c. voltage oc curing between electrodes of an electrostatic dust separator, said voltage being generated by a number of frequency related pulses together forming a pulse train. A mains volt age 50 Hz is fed via valve organs 8, 8a controlled by a control circuit 7 to a transformer T , the current pulses of which are full wave rectified 9 and are connected to elec trodes 10 of the dust separator. The control circuit 7 is so arranged as to extinguish an even number, being two, four or more, of pulses from the mains voltage between two consec utive pulses supplied to the electrodes of the dust separator. The control circuit 7 is also so arranged as to regulate the number of extinguished pulses and or the pulse form of the individual pulse, so that with each pulse that is trans ferred to the electrodes there is also transferred to the filter that quantity of energy which is the maximum possible with out producing flash over or reverberation, in addition to which the control circuit 7 must be so arranged as to mini mize the energy supply by controlling the length of the period between two consecutive pulses and by making this period as long as possible in relation to a limit value allocated to an opacimeter or similar.
