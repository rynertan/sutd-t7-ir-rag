# Injection moulding machine.

## Abstract
In a machine for the continuous and automatic produc tion of a succession of small components from synthetic plas tics material by injection moulding, the mould 18a, 18b and injection unit 19, 20, 21 are operatively connected to a com mon actuating device 1 through two separate transmission mechanisms which both include an element 10, 13 reciproc able along the longitudinal axis of the machine and are so interconnected that the injection unit cannot operate until the mould has been closed.
