## Description
A ALER UP CIRCUIT FOR SEQUENTIAL LOGIC DEVICESThis invention relates to an electronic circuit for a logic device. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved power up circuit for a sequential logic device to provide a high noise threshold before reactivation of the power up circuit.It is often desirable to steer or set sequential logic circuits such as used in registers into a known state during power up sequences. This can prove very useful in avoiding unwanted state vectors from occurring in a system design prior to an initial clock pulse when power is first applied to a circuit. For example, if multiple register outputs are connected to a common data bus, then bus contention problems could arise if more than one register powers up in the active or enabled state.This can occur since sequential logic circuits, by definition, are a function not only of inputs, but of previous state information. However, since there is no previous state during a power up sequence, such a logic circuit will power up in an undefined state unless some other circuit means is implemented to overcome this problem.Preferably, it is desirable to provide a circuit for defining the state of the logic circuits when power is applied which is independent of all other inputs since other inputs may also not be initially defined during the power up sequence. Typically, in the prior art, the solution to this problem has been the addition of some combinational logic to an otherwise sequential logic design to provide the necessary control signal during powerup to steer the sequential logic into the desired state. An initialize or INIT signal is generated when Vcc, the normal operating voltage which is typically 4.5 to 5.5 volts for TTL circuits, reaches an initial turn on or enable threshold voltage V1. However, to insure that the INIT pulse does, indeed, set the flip flop, the INIT signal must remain on until Vcc has subsequently reached a level V2 to permit the flip flop to become latched.Furthermore, the INIT signal must become disabled at some yet higher voltage V3 prior to Vcc reaching its minimum operating voltage and then stay disabled.as long as Vcc stays within its operating range, i.e., as long as the system is on. V2 must, therefore, be higher than V1, but lower than V3.Such power up circuitry can present problems, however, due to noise in the power supply line in the form of negative voltage spikes because the V3 INIT disabling voltage level is, of necessity, higher than the threshold voltage V2 needed to set the flip flops, yet lower than the normal operating voltage. Thus, an unwanted INIT signal could be accidently initiated during normal operations if a negative voltage spike resulted in Vcc dropping below V3. In essence then, the addition of such power up circuitry results in the normal logic circuits becoming more noise sensitive, due to this higher threshold, than they would be normally if there were no power up circuitry. Ideally, then, it would be desirable to provide circuitry to initialise or steerthe sequential logic without reducing the noise margin of the circuit with respect to noise in the power supply.The present invention provides a power up circuit to initialise one or more sequential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialised characterised by an initial high cut off voltage for the power up circuitry and means for lowering this cut off voltage during normal operations.The present invention also provides a powEr up circuit to initialise one or more sequential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialised characterised by an initial high cut off voltage for the power up circuitry and means for lowering this cut off voltage during normal operations comprising an SCR latch type circuit which provides a saturation loop to lower the threshold voltage for reinitiation of the power up circuit.The present invention also provides a power up circuit to initialise one or more sequential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialised comprising a first transistor which is activated to provide a steering signal to said logic circuits when said operating voltage rises to a first predetermined level, and second and third transistors having their respective bases coupled to the collector of the other to form an SCR loop which will provide a saturation or feedback loop to shut off the first transistor and lower the threshold voltage for reinitiation of the initialisation signal. The invention may provide power up circuitry to initialise one or more sequential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialised by providing an initial high cut off voltage for the power up circuitry and means for subsequently lowering this cut off voltage during normal operations.The invention may provide power up circuitry to initialise one or more sequential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialised by providing an initial high cut off voltage for the power up circuitry and means for subsequently lowering this cut off voltage during normal operations by using an SCR latch type circuit as a part of the power up circuit.The invention may provide power up circuitry to initialise one or more se quential logic circuits without reducing the noise margin of the logic circuit being initialized by providing an intial high cut off voltage for the power up circuitry and means for subsequently lowering this cut off voltage during normal operations comprising an SCR latch type circuit as a part of the power up circuit wherein a saturation or feedback loop disables the power up circuit and lowers the threshold voltage for reinitiation of the power up circuit.These and other features of the invention will be apparent from the following description and appended drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1 is a schematic view of a prior art powerup circuit.Figure 2 is a schematic view of a basic embodiment of the power up circuit of the invention.Figure 3 is a graph depicting the voltage levels during power up and normal operations.Figure 4 is a schematic view of an alternate embodiment of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAs previously discussed, the use of prior art power up circuits could result in an increased noise sensitivity due to the high threshold voltage used to disable the power up circuit. Figure 1 shows such a prior art circuit wherein the operating voltage Vcc causes a transistor Q1 to conduct and thus provide the power up voltage labelledINIT in figure 1 when Vcc reaches V1, i.e., the forward bias potential of one P N junction.Transistor Q1 continues to conduct as Vcc continues to rise through voltage V2 which allows the flipflops in the sequential logic circuits being initialized to become latched. However, when Vcc reaches voltage level V3, which in the illustrated circuit is equivalent to 3 times a single P N junction voltage plus the voltage drop across resistor R2, transistor Q2 is forward biased to con duct which turns off transistor Q1 and thereby disables the INIT signal. Vcc then continues to rise until it reaches the operating voltage of 4.5 to 5.5 volts. In this prior art circuit, however, if Vcc should subsequently drop, for example, due to a negative voltage spike from a noisy power supply, transistorQ2 will cease to conduct and transistor Q1 will then begin to conduct again to provide an unwantedINIT signal. This threshold or cut off voltage,Vth or V3, can be represented as Vth Vbe Q2 Vbe Dl Vbe D2 Vbe Q2 R2 R3The above equation assumes a sufficiently high DC current gain for the transistors used in the illustrated circuit such that the base currents can be neglected for threshold calculations, and this assumption will be employed throughout this description.The term Vbe as used herein is the base emitter voltage drop across a particular transistor or diode and is, therefore, intended to represent a voltage equivalent to the approximate voltage drop across 1 P N junction.The term INIT or initialize can be defined as a steering signal which may, upon power up, either set or reset each flip flop depending on the de signer s choice.Turning now to figure 2, the power up circuitry of the invention is illustrated. Transistor Q1 is again initially biased to conduct when Vcc reaches a voltage level of 1 P N junction. In the circuit of the invention, however, transistor Q2 is replaced by two transistors Q3 and Q4, which have their respective bases connected to the collector of the other transistor to form an SCR circuit providing a hysteresis threshold loop. As Vcc continues to rise, transistor O3 turns on which subsequently turns on transistor Q4 causing a saturation loop to form thus shutting off transistor Q1 because the voltage drops to approximately zero at point 50 caused by the saturation of transistor Q4.In order to turn transistor Q4 on, though, Vcc must first reach a level that forward biases the emitter base junction of transistor Q3 which, in the example, will occur when Vcc reaches 3 Vbe, i.e. , 3 times the P N junction voltage, since the base of transistor Q3 is at 1 Vbe and diode D1 is in series with the emitter of transistor Q3. At this point transistor Q3 begins to supply collector current to resistor R3.Transistor Q4 will not turn on yet, however, until its base potential reaches 1 Vbe. Thus the Vcc threshold at which transistor Q4 turns on is further boosted by 1 Vbe times the ratio of resistorR2 to resistor R3. This is represented by the equation Vth Vbe Ql Vbe Q3 Vbe Dl Vbe Q4 R2 R3When this threshold is reached and transistor Q4 is turned on, the circuit becomes an SCR type latch and transistor Q4 is driven into saturation. Due to the nature of the SCR circuit, the circuit will remain in a latched state until Vcc drops low enough to turn off the emitter base junction of transistor Q3. Since transistor Q4 is now saturated, this threshold is now lower than the turn on threshold of transistor Q4 by the difference between 1 Vbe and the saturated voltage of transistorQ4.Since this difference represents almost a full base emitter drop, since Vsat Q4 approaches 0, the noise margin of the power up circuit is increased by that amount which should lower its noise threshold below that of the sequential logic that it drives.In comparing this with the equation for the prior art threshold voltage Vth, it will be seen that the prior art threshold voltage was the equivalent of 3Vbe plus the voltage drop across resistor R2 while Vth above is the equivalent of approximately 2 Vbe plus the voltage across resistor R2, thus providing 1 Vbe of hysteresis in the threshold loop.Figure 3 graphically illustrates the operation of the invention. As the operating voltage, Vcc, begins to rise during power up, it first reaches V1 at which time the INIT signal used to steer the flip flops to a preferential state is turned on.Vcc then reaches V2 where the flip flops will then become latched. Vcc continues to rise to V3 where the INIT signal is disabled prior to Vcc reaching its operating level of 4.5 to 5.5 volts. At theVcc voltage level of V3 where the INIT signal is turned off, the SCR circuit is activated to satu rate the SCR transistors Q3 and Q4 as previously described.This lowers the voltage at point 50 shown in figure 2 thus lowering the turn off voltage for the INIT signal from V3 to a new level V3t. The new voltage threshold Vth V3 in the graph of figure 3 can thus be expressed as Vth Vsat Q4 Vbe Q3 Vbe D1 Vbe Q4 R2 R3This lowering of the threshold from V3 to V3 , in turn, considerably increases the noise margin as shown in the graph to a point where the controlling lower limit is the voltage level V2 below which the flip flops will not latch, i.e., the noise margin before introduction of the power up circuitry.The circuit configuration of the invention shown in figure 2 may be further modified to provide even greater amounts of hysteresis in the turn on and turn off thresholds of the SCR latch. As shown in figure 4, a diode D1 could be added between point 50 and the base of transistor Q1 and diode D1 eliminated. This embodiment would allow lowering of the Vth threshold to Vth while maintaining the same Vth. This would, however, raise the turnon voltage, V1, for the INIT signal by 1 P N junction. The equation for the new threshold voltage is Vth Vsat Q4 Vbe Q3 Vbe Q4 R2 R3In addition, the turn on threshold of the SCR circuit may be varied by adding or removing series diodes in the emitter circuit of transistor Q3 and by varying the ratio of resistors R2 to R3. Other minor modifications to the illustrated circuitry will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the teachings of the invention that an SCR circuit can be used to provide an initial high turn off or cut off of the power up signal which, upon activation of the SCR hysteresis loop, drops to a lower turn off theshold thus lowering the threshold voltage at which the INIT signal would be reactivated.Thus the invention permits the use of a power up circuit in sequential logic circuits without increasing the risk of loss of data due to an inadvertent reactivation or turn on of the power up circuit during operation due to a low voltage spike from a noisy power supply.Having thus described the invention, what is claimed is
