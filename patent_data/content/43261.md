# Glass mould lubrication.

## Abstract
Apparatus for spraying lubricant onto the blank moulds of an IS glass forming machine has static spray heads 20,21 above the open positions of the mould halves 14, to spray downwardly onto them when the mould halves are open. Electrical and pneumatic equipment in a separate cabinet causes metered quantities of lubricant to be delivered after a predetermined number of machine cycles. The neck rings 18 may also be sprayed by a further static spray head 36 which is positioned above the mould halves 14 and sprays through the space between them when they are open.
