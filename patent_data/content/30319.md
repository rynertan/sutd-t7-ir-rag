Conventionally, there are various constructions of radiator grills for covering the radiator of the automotive vehicles. For the radiator grill, one of the important factor being required thereto is appearance thereof, Also, the radiator grill is required to effectively introduce atmospheric air to effectively cool the radiator. In the various constructions of the conventional radiator grills, there has been known a kind having ornamental notching on every surface viewed from the outside. Generally the intake air flows through the surfaces of the radiator grill provided thereon the ornamental notching to be interfered flowing therethrough.Therefore, in such kind of conventional radiator grill has relatively low efficiency for introducing the atmospheric air therethrough by providing the ornamental notching. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiator grill which permits the intake air smoothly flowing therethrough without interfering of air flow and also without degrading the appearance thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved radiator grill having smooth opening to introduce the intake air with the same ornamentally notched appearance as the conventional one. According to the present invention, there is provided a radiator grill formed of semitransparent material and having smooth surface with an ornamentally notched appearance where is subject to air flow. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the radiator grill comprises a frame member and a cross bar member extending along the lateral portions of the frame and placed intermediate therebetween.On the frame member and the cross bar member where are not subject to the intake air flow, portions giving ornamentally notched appearance are provided. Both of the frame member and the cross bar member are formed of semitransparent material so that the portion giving the ornamental notched appearance can be seen through a plan smooth surface to which intake air subject.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereafter and from the accompanying drawings of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, which, however, should not be taken as limitative to the present invention but for elucidation and explanation only. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a radiator grill, showing one of the typical conventional construction thereof to which the improvement effected by the present invention has been directly directed Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the radiator grill of Fig. 1 taken along line II II of Fig. It Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the radiator grill according to the present invention, which is viewed at the same point as that ofFig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a sectional view of the radiator grill of Fig. 3 and taken along line IV IV of Fig. 3.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A preferred embodiment of a radiator grill according to the present invention will be illustrated and described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, particularly to Figs. 3 and 4. Before illustrating the preferred embodiment of the present invention, hereinafter given slightly detailed description of the typical construction of the radiator grill of the prior art, to which the improvement accomplished by the present invention has been directly directed. Figs. 1 and 2 shows the conventional radiator grill 10 which comprises a frame member 12 which is substantially rectangular shaped configuration in front elevation, a cross bar member 14 and a plurality of vertical member 16 supporting the cross bar member 14 in parallel relationship with the lateral portions 18 and 20 of the frame member 12. On the front surface of the upper lateral portion 18 and vertical portions 22 of the frame member 12 are formed with substantially saw tooth shaped notchings 24 in the purpose of grading the appearance. For the same purpose, on the upper surfaces of the cross bar member 14 and the lower lateral portion 20 of the frame member 12 are formed with substantially saw tooth shaped notchings 24.As seen from Fig. 2, the shape of the notchings 24 are substantially the same configurations extending along the horizontal or lateral edges of the upper and lower lateral portions 18 and 20 of the frame member 12. It will be appreciated that the shape of the frame should be adapted to the front end opening of the vehicle body and may not be limited to the specific form illustrated herewith. Also the number of the cross bar member is not always one but it can be provided some.Therefore, the improvement effected to the conventional radiator grill specifically illustrated hereabove should not be understood to limitative of the specific shape thereof. Returning to Fig. 2, the radiator grill 10 as illustrated above encountered some drawback or disadvantage to be improved. Namely, as shown in Fig. 2, the atmospheric air introduced into the interior of the engine room is interfered flowing by the notching. By interference of the atmospheric air flow, voltex of intake air is generated to decrease efficiency of air intake. As the result of this, radiator cannot be cooled so effectively by the intake air as required thereto. On the other hand, it will be advisable for better understanding of the advantageous accomplished by the present invention, that, for the automotive vehicle, the appearance thereof is one of the important factors, particularly, the front view of the automotive vehicle is the most important. Therefore, upon improving the abovementioned drawback remained in the conventional radiator grill, the matter concerning the appearance should be carefully taken into account. The present invention has been, therefore, proposed for improving the abovementioned drawback in the conventional construction of the radiator grill without degrading the appearance thereof and thus without degrading the appearance of the vehicle. Now, referring to Figs. 3 and 4, there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the radiator grill according to the present invention. It should be noted that, for simplification of the description given hereafter, features corresponding to the features of the foregoing example are represented by the same reference numerals. In Fig. 3, the radiator grill 10 comprises the frame member 12, cross bar member 14 and a plurality of the vertical members 16. The frame member 12, cross bar member 14 and the vertical members 16 are made of synthetic resin or the like, and are formed integrally. The upper and lower lateral portions 18 and 20 and the cross bar member 14 is inclined up toward the respective inner ends thereof.The upper lateral portion is provided with a vertically bent portion extending downwardly from the outer end thereof. The lower lateral portion 20 and the cross bar member 14 is inwardly turned portions to form substantiallyU shaped ends at the outer ends thereof. The whole parts of the radiator grill 10 is colored semitransparent so that respective opposite surface can be viewed therethrough. On the inner surfaces 30 of the upper lateral portion 18 of the vertical portions 22 of the frame member 12 is formed with substantially saw tooth shaped notchings 24. Likewise, on the lower surfaces of the lower lateral portion 20 of the frame member 12 and the cross bar member 14 are formed with substantially saw tooth shaped notchings 24 of the same configuration as the same formed on the upper lateral portion and vertical portions of the frame member 12. As seen from Fig. 3, the notchings 24 thus formed can be viewed from the front side of the vehicle through the each parts of the radiator grill 10 of semitransparent. The radiator grill thus constructed is secured to the front end of the vehicle by a known securing means such as a screw or bolt passing through a bracket 32 protruding on the upper surface of the frame member 12. The radiator grill according to the present invention can permit smoothly flowing the intake air therethrough without interfering air flow and generating voltex of air thereabout. In addition, according to the present invention, since the radiator grill is made into semitransparent form, the notching provided on each part of the radiator grill where the air flow does not subject, the appearance of the radiator grill can be kept as the same as the conventional ones. While the present invention has been shown and described with respect to the specific embodiment, various modifications could be made to the form and the material to embody the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should be understood to include all the possible modifications without departing from the principles of the invention.
