# Tryptophan overproducer mutants of cereal crops.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to the production of novel plant genotypes or lines which produce increased free tryptophan levels and are resistant to inhibition by analogs which normally inhibit the activity of the enzyme anthranilate synthase before alteration. This invention further relates to genes encoding such enzymes, and to processes for utilizing these novel genes and enzymes. Further products of the invention include plants, plant tissues and seeds which exhibit resistance to such analogs and overproduce tryp tophan resulting from expression of genes encoding analog resistant anthranilate synthase enzyme.
