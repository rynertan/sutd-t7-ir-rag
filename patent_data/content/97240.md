# Process for removal of sulfur oxides from hot gases.

## Abstract
A process for the removal of sulfur oxides from two gas streams containing the same. One gas stream is introduced into a spray dryer zone and contacted with a finely dispersed spray of an aqueous medium containing an absorbent for sulfur oxides. The aqueous medium is introduced at a controlled rate so as to provide water to the gas in an amount to produce a cooled product gas having a temperature at least 7 C. above its adiabatic saturation temperature and from about 125 300 of the stoichiometric amount of absorbent required to react with the sulfur oxides to be removed from the gas stream. The effluent from the spray dryer zone comprises a gas stream of reduced sulfur oxide content and contains entrained dry particulate reaction products including unreacted absorbent. This gas stream is then introduced into a particulate removal zone from which is withdrawn a gas stream substantially free of particles and having a reduced sulfur oxide content. The dry particulate reaction products are collected and utilized as a source of absorbent for a second aqueous scrubbing medium. Concur rently the other gas stream is introduced into an aqueous scrubbing zone and contacted with the second aqueous scrubbing medium containing unreacted absorbent for the sulfur oxides. An effluent gas stream is withdrawn from the aqueous scrubbing zone and comprises a water saturated gas stream of reduced sulfur oxide content and substantially free of particles. The effluent gas streams from the particu late removal zone and the aqueous scrubbing zone are combined in such proportions that the combined gas stream has a temperature above its adiabatic saturation tempera ture.
