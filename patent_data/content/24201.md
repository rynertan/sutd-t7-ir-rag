# Stabilized alkali metal percarbonate bleach compositions and process for manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
Powder bleaching compositions comprising sodium per carbonate are known and are desirable for textile treatment. However, sodium perborate tends to be used in many instances despite its cost and hazards in view of the relatively poor storage stability of sodium percarbonate. Various treat ments to improve the stability of sodium percarbonate have been partially successful but have given rise to problems such as undesirable insoluble laundry residues, in the case of many coating treatments, and component separation on stor age handling, in the case of separate stabilizing additives. The invention overcomes the prior art instability problems without these drawbacks by providing a bleaching composi tion in the form of particles of a mixture comprising sodium percarbonate and a phosphate compound stabilizer for the percarbonate. The percarbonate usually is present in suffi cient quantity to provide 1 to 6 wt. available oxygen and the phosphate normally amounts to at least 2 wt.
