## Description
This invention relates to a topical pharmaceutical formulation suitable for use in treating virus infections of the skin and mucosa, and in particular it relates to topical formulations containing 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine, otherwise known as acyclovir, and hereinafter referred to as such. Acylovir and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof are known to have antiviral activity against various classes of DNA and RNA viruses both in vitro and in vino, see UK patent No 1 523 865. in particular the compound is active against herpes simplex virus which causes herpetic keratitis in rabbits, herpetic encephalitis in mice, and cutaneous herpes in guinea pigs. Acyclovir suffers from the disadvantage that it has a low solubility in water and is almost totally insoluble in hydrophobic solvent systems. It is accordingly difficult to produce a topical formulation containing a sufficient dissolved concentration of active ingredient for it to exert its full effect and also to optimise the flux of the compound into the skin. In addition to ease of release it is also important that any formulation of a pharmaceutically active compound should be stable for long periods of time, should not lose its potency, should not discolour or form insoluble substances or complexes, and also should not be unduly irritating to the skin or mucosa. In example 26 of UK patent No 1 523 865 there are listed the constituents of an oil in water cream containing 5 w w acylovir, amongst which constituents is 5 wlw propylene glycol. The function of the propylene glycol in the formulation of example 26 is to act as an humectant, i.e. a hygroscopic ingredient, which should improve the cosmetic feel of the product and also limit dehydration during storage. In animal experiments this formulation and a formulation of aqueous cream B.P. British Pharmacoepia containing acyclovir did not provide a particularly rapid cure probably because of insufficient active ingredient in solution and poor penetration of the active ingredient into the skin. In view of the lipid nature of the skin surface, especially the stratum corneum, it has long been thought that to achieve good transdermal penetration the active ingredient in an emulsion should be located in the oil phase so that it can partition into the lipid components of the skin. It has now been found that, in order to optimise the release of acyclovir from topical formulations, the maximum solubilised concentration of drug should be in the external phase of an oil in water emulsion preparation, i.e. in the aqueous phase. Further it has been found that by using a high concentration of a polyhydric alcohol as a cosolvent in the aqueous phase, for example at least 50 v v of that phase, an increased concentration of solubilised acyclovir can be attained, leading to enhanced activity and efficacy of such formulations.Such a high concentration of a polyhydric alcohol also dispenses with the necessity of including a preservative as an additional ingredient in the formulation. Such topical formulations also satisfy the criteria of adequate stability, maintenance of potency and are not unduly irritating to the skin or mucosa and have the advantages over the prior art formulation of penetrating skin more effectively and in greater concentration with the result that a rapid, complete cure of the infection is achieved. According to the present invention there is provided an oil in water topical pharmaceutical formulation for the treatment of virus diseases of the skin or mucosa of a mammal comprising a dispersed oil phase and a continuous aqueous phase containing therein water, at least 30 of a water miscible poly hydric alcohol by weight of the formulation and solubilised acycl√≤JvlM. VreMeZaMly the formulation contains a maximum of 50 water. Such a topical formulation may contain 0.075 to 10 w w acyclovir or a salt or an ester thereof, from 30 to 60 w w of a polyhydric alcohol, from 15 to 50 w w water and an oil phase. Hereafter references to acyclovir should be understood to include also its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. In a preferred aspect the formulation comprises from 1 to 10 w w acyclovir, from 30 to 50 w w of a polyhydric alcohol, from 20 to 40 w w water together with an oil phase, whilst the most preferred formulation comprises from 2 to 5 w w acyclovir, from 35 to 45 w w of a polyhydric alcohol, from 25 to 40 w w water together with an oil phase. The formulation should preferably contain about 40 w w of a polyhydric alcohol. A polyhydric alcohol is an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups.Polyhydric alcohols suitable for incorporation into the topical formulation of the present invention include glycols and macrogols such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3 diol, polyethylene glycol and glycerol, propylene glycol being the preferred alcohol. When at least 50 v v of a polyhydric alcohol is used in the aqueous phase of a formulation of the present invention, the maximum concentration of acyclovir at ambient temperature rises from 0.15 w w, that being the maximum aqueous solubility of acyclovir, to 0.3 w w. Thus if aqueous phase concentrations of greater than 0.3 w w acyclovir are incorporated into a formulation the amount of active ingredient in excess of 0.3 will be in suspension and act as a reservoir of drug. The amount of acyclovir present in the formulation should be at least sufficient to be antivirally effective and to be non toxic. The water used in the formulation is preferably purified water, purified that is according to the standards of the British Pharmacopoeia. The oil phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier otherwise known as an emulgent , it is desirably comprised of a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, as explained in more detail below, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier s with or without stabiliser s make up the so called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and or fat make up the so called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oil dispersed phase of the emulsions. Oil in water topical formulations may be formulated in a number of ways, all of which depend primarily on the alignment of the emulgent or emulsifying agent and emulsion stabiliser at the oil water interface, with the nonpolar or lipophilic groups soluble in the oil phase and the polar or hydrophilic or lipophilic groups in the aqueous or continuous phase. Thus the more polar hydrophilic emulgents result in oil in water emulsions. This principle has been systemised in the idea of a hydrophilic lipophilic balance H.L.B. Griffen, W. C, 3. Soc. Cos. Met. Chem., 1954, 5, 249 and the various emulgents have been allocated H.L.B. numbers from which their behaviour with constituents of the aqueous and oil phases to which are applied theoretical required H.L.B. figures may be predicted. It is a well established theory of oil in water emulsion formulation that the combination of a lipophilic emulgent with a hydrophilic emulgent of the same chemical type may be used in varying proportions to give the requiredH.L.B. value. With the high concentration of polyhydric alcohol required to maximise acyclovir release from the formulation of the present invention an H.L.B.value of from 3.5 to 10.0, preferably 4.0 to 8.0, most preferably about 5.5, is desirable, compared with the accepted H.L.B. range for mineral oil in water emulsions of 8 to 18. Emulgents and emulsion stabilisers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate polysorbate 60 , sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan mono oleate, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono stearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. One preferred combination of emulgents is cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl sulphate in a ratio of from 3 1 to 30 1 preferably from 6 1 to 20 1, most preferably from 9 1 to 15 1. In addition, the formulation may optionally contain other emulgents such as poloxamers in an amount of from 0.1 to 3 w w, preferably 0.3 to 2 w w, most preferably about 1 w w of the formulation. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of acyclovir in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non greasy, non staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono or dibasic alkyl esters such as di isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2 ethylhexyl palmitate or a mixed ester of 2 ethyl hexanoic acid with a blend of butyl or stearyl alcohols known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being the preferred esters. These may be used singly or in combination depending on the properties required.Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used. The present invention further provides a method for the preparation of a topical pharmaceutical formulation, as hereinbefore defined, which comprises mixing the combination of acyclovir, polyhydric alcohol and water with the oil phase. The manner of formulating the emulsion will of course vary according to the amount and nature of the constituents, but nevertheless follows known techniques in emulsion technology see The Pharmaceutical Codex, London,The Pharmaceutical Press, 1979 . For example the acyclovir may be initially incorporated wholely in the aqueous portion where it may form a solution alone, or a mixed solution suspension, and then emulsified with the ointment base.Alternatively where high concentrations of acyclovir are being used, a part of the aqueous portion may be formulated as an emulsion, and the balance of the water, polyhydric alcohol and acyclovir added to and dispersed into the emulsion. In another technique the acyclovir may be included in the emulsifying ointment prior to emulsification with the aqueous portion. In using these procedures, it is preferable to heat the aqueous portion and the ointment base to about 40 to 800C, preferably 50 to 700C, prior to emulsification which may be achieved by vigorous agitation using for example a standard laboratory mixer. Finer dispersions of the oil phase may be obtained by homogenising or milling in a colloidal mill. A topical formulation of the present invention may be used in the treatment or prevention of viral infections caused for example by Herpes zoster,Herpes varicella and Herpes simplex types 1 and 2, which cause diseases such as shingles, chicken pox, cold sores and genital herpes. The formulation should desirably be applied to the affected area of skin from 2 to 6 times daily, preferably from 3 to 4 times.
