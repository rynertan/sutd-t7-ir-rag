# Novel imidazophenoxazines, preparation thereof and use thereof in electrochromic recording systems.

## Abstract
4 N Acylamino 8 N R¹ N R² amino imidazophenoxa zines useful as color formers, particularly in electrochromic re cording systems, are prepared by the interaction of the cor responding 1,3 diamino 7 N R¹ N R² amino phenooxazinium halide with a reducing agent to obtain the corresponding leuco compound and subsequently interacting the leuco compound with at least two molecular proportions of an acylating agent.
