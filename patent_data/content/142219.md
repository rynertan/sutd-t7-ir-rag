## Description
1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION i Field of the Invention This invention relates to a system and method for the protection of pumps by electrochemical means. More particularly, it is directed to a method and apparatus for protecting, from corrosion, stainless steel pumps used to pump agressive solutions in bleach plants or kraft pulping liquor lines. ii Description of the Prior Art Stainless steel is known to be generally resistant to corrosion due to a build up thereon of passive films.However, such passive films are susceptible to localized breakdown, and this susceptibility is greatly enhanced in the presence of specific ions. The filtrate used in bleach plant washers generally contains oxidants, e.g., chlorine C12 , chlorine dioxide C102 , or hypochlorite OC1 together with a considerable amount of chloride ions. Such filtrate can bring about localized passive film failure. The loss of protection leads to various modes of localized corrosion, the principal ones being crevice corrosion and pitting corrosion. The corrosion environment in the chlorine and chlorine dioxide stages of a bleach plant is generally acidic, with a pH in the range of 1 to 7. Stainless steel pumps are therefore used to pump such liquids. The most common alloys of construction are 316L and 317L stainless steel or their equivalents. The corrosion environment in the hypochlorite stage of bleach washers is generally alkaline, with a pH in the range of 8 11. Stainless steel pumps are therefore used to pump such liquids. The most common alloy of construction is 316L or equivalent stainless steel. It would be preferable to use 304L or equivalent stainless steel since it is much cheaper than 316L stainless steel.However, 304L stainless steel has been largely unsuccessful for this use because of severe chloride crevice corrosion. The corrosion environment in alkaline pulping liquor systems generally has a pH above 12 and may contain unsettled solids, e.g. carbonates and general dirt and debris from the wood chips. Both stainless steels and carbon steels are common materials of construction however, it is most common to use 316L stainless steel for liquor pumps. These pumps suffer from erosion corrosion brought about by the combined action of corrosive pulping liquor and erosion due to unsettled solids. It would be beneficial to control the corrosion component of this attack, thereby extending the life of alkaline liquor pumps. Electrochemical corrosion control would seem to offer a solution to the widespread problems of crevice and pitting corrosion of stainless steels in the pumps used for pumping the corrosive solutions used in the aforesaid pulp mill environments. Many patents teach the concept of corrosion control, either by inducing passivity in the metal by anodic polarization techniques, or by cathodic polarization. Amongst the prior patents dealing with the anodic polarization are United States Patents Nos. 3,371,023 issued February 7, 1968 3,375,183 issued March 26, 1968 3,378,472 issued April 16, 1968 3,379,629 issued April 23, 1968 3,409,526 issued November 5, 1968 UnitedStates Patent No. 1,576,581 issued March 16, 1926, to Elmore et al United States Patent No. 3,442,779 issuedMay 6, 1969 to Hoey United States Patent No. 4,018,647 issued April 19, 1977 to Poyser and United States PatentNo. 4,036,716 issued July 19, 1977 to Hulthe. Amongst the prior patents which relate to the application of cathodic protection of metal surfaces including precise control of the impressed current are UnitedStates Patent No. 2,435,937 issued February 17, 1948 toMacTaggart et alt United States Patent No. 3,634,222 issued January 11, 1972 to Stephens, Jr. United StatesPatent No. 3,692,650 issued September 19, 1972 to Kipps et al and United States Patent No. 4,080,272 issuedMarch 21, 1978 to Ferry et al. A further improved electrochemical corrosion protection technique was taught in United States Patent No.4,285,787 issued August 25, 1981 to A. Garner andL.H. Laliberte. That patent taught a method of electrochemical protection by cathodic polarization of a stainless steel member subjected periodically to varying concentrations of corrosive, oxidizing chloride ions, e.g., a partly submersed, rotating, stainless steel drum in a vat containing a corrosive oxidizing chloride containing bleach liquor. That method taught the essential step of impressing a protective potential to the stainless steel member, e.g., the drum, at a predetermined voltage in the range of 600 to 400 mV g AgC1 the predetermined voltage being sufficiently low to draw the stainless steel into a passive corrosion protection zone but not sufficiently low to draw it into a zone of uniform corrosion.Yet the application of this protection method to a stainless steel pump would not serve to provide corrosion protection to the pump.2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION i Statement of Invention This invention now provides a pump for pumping an aqueous agressive chloride ion containing liquid. The pump includes a stainless steel casing, an inlet limb either made of stainless steel and electrically isolated from the stainless steel casing, or of glass fibre reinforced plastic , which is connected to the stainless steel casing, and, an outlet limb either made of stainless steel and electrically isolated from the stainless steel casing or of glass fibre reinforced plastic , which is connected to the stainless steel casing. Means are included for electrically connecting the stainless steel casing to a source of DC voltage, thereby to induce the stainless steel casing to act as a cathode or anode. At least one reference electrode is secured within, and is electrically isolated from, the inlet limb and or outlet limb.At least one counter electrode is secured within and is electrically isolated from the same inlet limb and or outlet limb. Means to electrically connect the counter electrode to the source of DC voltage. Finally, control means are provided for impressing a protection potential to the stainless steel casing at a predeter mined voltage of 800 mV mVAg AgCl or more positive. Such predetermined voltage is sufficient to draw the stainless steel casing into a passive corrosion zone, but is not sufficiently low to draw the stainless steel casing into a zone of uniform corrosion. ii Other Features of the Invention Because of the shape of the pump casing, it has been found that it is necessary to provide a working electrode i.e., the pump with two separate sets of reference electrode and counter electrode. One reference electrode and counter electrode set is placed at the pump inlet and the other reference electrode and counter electrode set is placed at the pump outlet. The exact combination of reference and counter electrodes used depends upon the aggressiveness of the solution being pumped. Successful protection is provided whether or not the system is in its pumping mode, and no damage occurs when the system is not in its pumping mode. The invention also provides a pump and a method of protecting a pump comprising any novel feature or novel combination of features disclosed herein. 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There are various types of reference electrodes which may be used. Two types of the screw in type, or of the breech type holder. The reference electrode may be an Ag AgCl insert which is epoxy potted, with a silicone seal, in titanium, nickel base alloy, stainless steel or synthetic plastic material, or it may be a saturated calomel electrode. Similarly, the counter electrode may be of various types. Two such types are of the U bend form, or of the cantilever form with a blow out preventer. The counter electrode may be platinized niobium on copper, or it may be 316L stainless steel. The pump is preferably provided with two coverplates, one on the suction side, the other on the pressure side. The coverplates may be of stainless steel, nickel base alloy or titanium, or of synthetic plastic material. If the coverplate is made from a synthetic plastic material, it is preferred that the coverplate be provided with a stainless steel backing plate. The coverplates may be situated on small side arms set into the main process piping, preferably where the side arms are of the T or Y type. The invention also provides a method of protecting a pump having a stainless steel casing, an inlet limb and an outlet limb, comprising the steps of electrically connecting said stainless steel casing to a source of DC voltage, thereby to induce the stainless steel casing to act either as a cathode or anode securing at least one reference electrode within at least one of said inlet limb and said outlet limb securing at least one counter electrode within the same limb selected from said inlet limb and said outlet limb and impressing a protection potential to said stainless steel casing at a predetermined voltage of 800 mV or more positive, said Ag AgCl predetermined voltage being sufficient to draw the stainless steel casing into a passive corrosion zone, but ndt being sufficiently low to draw said stainless steel casing into a zone of uniform corrosion, in situations where such corrosion is possible. Experiments were conducted to investigate pump protection in both bleach plant, and chemical pulping, environments. A 316L type stainless steel laboratory pump was used, and experiments were carried out using simulated chlorine stage and chlorine dioxide stage bleach solutions1 and a simulated white liquor. In each case, the protection obtained was assessed by measuring potentials within the pump casing at various locations by means of salt bridges. Two reference electrode counter electrode sets were used, one at the pump inlet and one at the pump outlet. A potentiostat was used, with the reference electrode at the pump inlet being employed as the control electrode. Chlorine stage tests were carried out with chlorine concentrations ranging from 0 to 125 ppm. Typical results are shown in Table I. Without protection, potentials across the pump casing were in the range 370 to 600 mVAg AgCl When protection was applied with a 250 mVAg AgCl set point, the potentials were depressed into the range 250 to 100 mVAg AgCl, the value depending on exact location within the pump and the chlorine concentration. The results in Table I indicate that, as the chlorine concentration increased, the potentials within the protected pump became more positive. Even for very high C12 concentrations, however, potentials within the pump were kept at, or below 100 mVAg AgCl.

Results of tests done with the pump in chlorine dioxide stage conditions are shown in Table III. Without protection, potentials within the pump casing lay in the range 380 to 600 mV mVAg AgCl. When protection was ap plied with a 250 mVAg AgCl set point, these potentials fell until they were in the range 250 to 310 the exact value depending on pump casing location and chlorine dioxide concentration.Table 3.

Results are shown in Table IV. It should be noted that the tests are concerned only with Type 317L or equivalent stainless steel, as this is generally the minimum grade used in bleach plants for chlorine dioxide stage pumps.

Comparison of this data to that in Table III shows that significant protection of a 317L type pump casing will be achieved, even though the net change in potential at the impeller housing position is relatively small. A third set of experiments was carried out using a synthetic white liquor. Results are shown in Table V.With no protection, potentials within the pump casing were at about 860 to 890 mVAg AgCl. With and for a 800 mVAg AgCl set point, potentials lay within the range of BOO to 790 Table V.

These results show that the corrosion rate was reduced by almost two thirds by the application of protection to the pump. 4.
