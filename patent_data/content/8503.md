# Temperature control apparatus and a missile including such apparatus.

## Abstract
A solid state temperature gradient cooling system in which thermal energy is, under a first condition, carried from a heat source to a heat storage device 20 and under a second condition is carried from the heat source and storage device 20 to a heat dissipator 2 . The change in conditions is responsive to changes in the temperature of the heat dis sipator above and below a predetermined value. Bimetallic disc elements 16 are employed, which respond to tempera ture changes about the predetermined temperature, and snap from a first condition concave, convex surface configuration to a second condition convex concave configuration. The disc elements 16 are supported about their outer peripheries so that the change in configuration will cause the centre of the disc 16 to move along on axis normal to the disc. This movement is used to respectively open and close a low resis tance thermal path 10, 12 ,8 between the heat dissipator 2 and a first thermal conducting path 24, 10, 22 defined to transmit thermal energy between the heat source and the heat sink 20 .
