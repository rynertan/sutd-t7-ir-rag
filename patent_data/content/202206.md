# Robot.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a robot comprising a positioning head 7 which is moved to the desired position with the aid of setting devices 1 which can be lengthened or shortened. Each setting device 1 is secured via a first joint 4 in a fixed frame 5 , enabling each setting device 1 to pivot freely in relation to the frame. Each setting device 1 is attached via a second joint 6 to the movable positioning head 7 . An arm 8 extending from the positioning head 7 is located between the setting devices and extends through the central opening of a universal joint 11 supported by the frame 5 . The arm is movable in axial direction in relation to the joint and is controlled thereby in radial direction. It can also be set at different angles to the frame 5 .
