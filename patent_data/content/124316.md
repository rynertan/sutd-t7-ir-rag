## Description
FREQUENCY DISCRIMI5JATORS This invention relates to frequency disciminators, particularly for use in obtaining the A.F. signal from an incoming frequency modulated R.F. signal in an F.M. radio receiver. With the desire in the electronics industry for the miniaturisation of components and circuits, a frequency discriminator which uses a minimal number of components and capable of operation at low voltage is clearly of interest. We have now devised such a circuit, which is suitable for use in a miniature F.M.radio receiver. According to the invention, we provide a frequency discriminator comprising a frequency filter, means for enabling a frequency modulated input signal to be provided to said filter, means for obtaining from the filter a signal whose phase relative to said input signal varies as a function of frequency, a differential peakzdetecting transistor for receiving said input signal and the phase variant signal, for detecting said phase variation and for providing an output signal characteristic of the modulation of said input signal, and means for stabilising the peak detecting transistor by feedback from the output signal. Various types of filters may be employed in the circuit to provide the phase variable signal either high, low or bandpass type filters. The filter should however preferably provide a constant amplitude signal across its range of operating frequencies. The filter may be an RC or LC circuit, or a quartz resonator. We prefer to employ ceramic filters since, inter alia, these are very compact. The input F.M. signal and the phase variant signal from the filter are supplied directly to a differential peak detector whose bias is stablised by direct current feedback. The advantage of feedback is to provide low output impedance and increased gain. Preferred features of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing, which illustrates a circuit diagram of an embodiment for use in an F.M. radio receiver. The frequency modulated R.F. signal is applied to the circuit at 2, and to one pole 4 of a ceramic two pole bandpass filter 6. The input signal 2 also is supplied to the base of a transistor 14, biassed with a voltage Vbb. The emitter of the transistor 14 is connected to the second pole 10 of the filter and which provides the phase variant signal. The collector of the transistor 14 is connected to a second transistor 16 which acts as a low frequency amplifier.The A.F. output signal is obtained from the collector of transistor 16 whereas a feedback to the emitter of transistor 14 is provided by line 18 to stabilise the bias on the latter transistor. In use, Vbb biasses the base of transistor 14 at about 0.7 volts onto which is applied the incomingR.F. signal. The signal seen at the pole 10 or filter 6 varies in phase from 0 to 1800 relative to the R.F.signal at pole 4 depending on the frequency of the latter signal. The filter is selected such that at one extreme of the input frequency range the phase shift is small and correspondingly a small output signal results whilst at the other extreme of the input frequency range the phase shift is close to 1800 and hence maximum output is obtained. the condition if no modulation exists results in an approximately 900 phase shift A central output value results. Modulation causes the output to swing about this central value. In a further embodiment, which is a variation of that shown in the drawing, the two pole ceramic filter 6 is replaced by a single pole ceramic filter connected between the base and emitter of transistor 14.
