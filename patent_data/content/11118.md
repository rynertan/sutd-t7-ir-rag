# Apparatus and method using an air preheater for maintaining a preselected level for the temperature of a flue gas.

## Abstract
In a pulverized fuel fired steam generator, a steam air heater 22 is disposed in the air inlet duct to the main air heater 10 . Steam from an auxiliary in plant source or from the boiler itself is passed through the steam air heater 22 thereby increasing the temperature of the air entering the main air heater 10 . The flow rate of steam passed through the steam air heater is regulated to maintain the flue gas temperature entering dust collection equipment 14 located in the flue gas stream downstream of the main air heater 10 above the dew point of water vapor and the condensation point of sulfuric acid during start up and low load operations.
