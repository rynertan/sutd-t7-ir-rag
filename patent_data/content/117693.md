# ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOASSAY, ASSAY KITS AND PAIR BINDING COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
An immunoassay, for measuring the amount of a ligand present in a medium, uses a luciferase labelled binding pair member selected from a ligand and a receptor, in which the luciferase is linked to the binding pair member via its reactive sulfhydryl group and is thereby reversibly inactivated. A kit, for use in an immunoassay to determine the presence of a ligand in a medium, which comprises a plurality of con tainers, a first container containing luciferase labelled receptor or ligand a purified version of the ligand to be assayed and a second container containing receptor which may be immo bilised. New compounds have a reactive group which can react to cause reversible inactivation of luciferase and a group which can react with one or more sites on a binding receptor or ligand.
