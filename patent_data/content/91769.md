# Oxidative afterwash treatment for crease resisting fabrics.

## Abstract
The level of released formaldehyde in a durable press treated fabric is significantly reduced or eliminated altogether by an oxidative aftertreatment process in which the fabric 10 , after treatment with a formaldehyde based durable press finishing agent 13 and curing to impart durable press properties, is contacted with an oxidizing agent to destroy formaldehyde releasing moieties present in the fabric. Preferably, the treatment of the durable press fabric with the oxidizing agent is carried out by impregnating the fabric with a solution 16 containing the oxidizing agent and then providing the fabric 10 a residence time in contact with the oxidizing agent to allow for reaction of the oxidizing agent with the formaldehyde releasing moieties.
