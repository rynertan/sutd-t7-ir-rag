# Pump less paint spray booth.

## Abstract
A spray booth 10 incorporating an air cleaning system for removing overspray paint particles from the air consist ing of a water curtain 20 from behind which ducts 40 extend upwardly from above a lower water reservoir 38 . An air flow produced by a centrifugal blower 30 passes through the water curtain 20 and up through the ducts 40 entraining water. On entering the plenum 46 , adjacent to the ducts 40 , the flow velocity is reduced such that the entrained water is released and flows to an upper water reservoir 52 . A splash plate 47 interposed between the ducts 40 and the plenum 46 creates sufficient turbulence 22 to wash the particles from the air and to prevent water from being exhausted along with the air.
