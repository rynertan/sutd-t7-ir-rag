## Description
ORBITAL HYDRAULIC MOTOR WITH FRONTAL DISTRIBUTION AND HYDROSTATICGAP COMPENSATIONOrbital hydraulic motors are known comprising a motor unit constituted by a stator element having n flutes, for example 7, and a lobed rotor which rolls inside said stator element and has n l cusps , for example 6. Variable volume chambers are thus defined between said two elements.With this motor unit there is associated a distributor unit comprising a bored cylindrical member which rotates together with the rotor, and a fixed bored cylindrical member, these connecting the hydraulic fluid inlet and outlet ports to the motor unit chambers which are in the expansion stage and contraction stage respectively.Moreover, such known motors are provided with a transmission shaft which is inclined to the longitudinal axis of the respective motor and which comprises at its ends two toothing sections with curved generating lines. One of these sections is engaged with corresponding internal toothing of the lobed rotor and the other is engaged with internal toothing provided on the motion output shaft, so that said transmission shaft functions as a double Cardan shaft.In addition, in the aforesaid orbital motors the distributor unit is at the opposite end of the motor unit to the motion output shaft.The widespread use of such known motors has disclosed the drawbacks described hereinafter. A first drawback consists of the excessive oil seepage which occurs between the mobile and fixed parts in spite of the precision machine finish to which the respective contacting surfaces are subjected, with a consequent drastic reduction in volumetric efficiency. This latter continues to decrease as the motor life increases, because of the inevitable wear suffered by said members.Furthermore, the fact that in known designs these gaps, whether due to assembly or to wear by friction, are difficult to compensate or take up means that unbalance occurs between the axial forces acting between the various facing zones of said fixed and mobile members, so that the rotating part of the distributor unit tends to become misaligned or inclined to the motor unit, with the result that the hydraulic fluid distribution becomes out of phase, leading to consequent fluctuation or pulsation of the torque on the output shaft, which in certain industrial applications is inadmissible. In addition, said misalignment increases the power loss by friction, thus reducing the motor efficiency, the aforesaid drawbacks being even more serious when the corresponding motor is made to rotate alternately in the two opposing directions.Again, in many industrial applications these orbital motors must not only have a determined power but must also be of limited overall dimensions, particularly in the longitudinal direction, and which because of the position occupied by the distributor unit is difficult to obtain in known motors without prejudicing the essential requirement which has to be satisfied by the transmission shaft.This requirement is that saw transmission shaft must be of such a length that it becomes only slightly inclined to the longitudinal axis of its motor. Thus in order to reduce said longitudinal dimension it is necessary to shorten the transmission shaft, thus increasing its inclination and causing it to assume an unacceptable working position which lowers the motor efficiency and lead9a more rapid wear of the toothing. The present patent provides and protects a hydraulic motor able to obviate the aforesaid by means of a simple and rational constructional design.This is attained according to the invention by locating the distributor unit between the motor unit and the output shaft. Said distributor unit comprises two annular members which embrace the transmission shaft and are provided circumferentially with longitudinal bores arranged to communicate with the chambers of said motor unit by way of a header, these bores defining, at the opposite end to this latter, two annular chambers which collect the inlet and outlet fluid respectively, and which are faced by thrust surfaces of said two annular members which are of greater area than thrust surfaces which face the motor unit.In this manner the distributor elements are constantly pressed tightly together against the header, ie towards the motor unit, leading to automatic compensation or take up of all gaps, whether deriving from construction or assembly, or due to wear by friction.Thus, oil seepage is eliminated in practice to the total advantage of the volumetric efficiency, and higher operating pressures can be used for the motor with resultant particularly high volumetric efficiency, even without precise surface finishes. 9 This constructional design also provides a motor which is extremely compact and relatively light, without it being necessary to shorten the transmission shaft.Furthermore, according to the invention there are also provided elastic members such as springs between the motor casing and the distributor unit, these aiding the hydraulic fluid in pressing together the said elements and, in particular, ensuring that these elements remain pressed together when the motor is stationary, with consequent improved operation of this latter at its next start. In addition, on that face of the header which s in contact with the rotating element of the distributor unit, there is provided a series of impressions or cavities which are intercalated with the passages leading to the motor unlit, and which enable an almost perfect balance of the hydrostatic thrusts acting between the header and said rotating ring to be obtained, so that this latter is kept coaxial and parallel to the header, with consequent distribution regularity.According to the invention, the proposed positioning of the distributor unit is made possible by using, between the drive shaft and the rotating ring of the distributor, a coupling comprising a bush which at its opposing ends has two pairs of diametrically opposing prolongations, the front ones being rotated through 900 relative to the rear ones, and which are arranged for insertion into respective internal conjugate seats of the motion output shaft and of the rotating ring of the distributor. These and further constructional characteristics and merits of the invention will be more apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter with reference to the figures of the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a section on the line I I of Figure 2 Figure 2 is a front view of the invention, ie looking at the end comprising the motion output shaft Figure 3 is a plan projection of the preceding figure Figure 4 sheet II 3 is a section on the line IV IV of Figure 3.Said figures, and in particular Figure 1, show that the invention comprises a metal casing 1 on the front of which there is fixed, by screws 3, a head piece 2 which in a sealed manner centrally receives the terminal part of the motion output shaft 4. This latter is mounted rotatable relative to the casing 1 by means of two robust rolling bearings 5 of roller type, which are kept in their correct working position by a retention shoulder visible inFigure 1, together with an interposed spacer 6. The elements 5 and 6 are axially locked by means of a metal split ring 7 held in a respective circumferential groove in the shaft 4.Compared with the known prior art, which provides for the use of a ring nut mounted on the shaft 4, this type of locking is free from the risk of slackening, and is also more economical, less bulky and simpler to dismantle and reassemble.As clearly shown in Figure 1, the inner terminal part of the shaft 4 has a blind coaxial cavity in which internal circumferential toothing 8 is provided, with which there engages corresponding toothing provided on the front widened head of a transmission shaft 9.Said end toothing has curved generating lines in order to enable the transmission shaft 9 to swivel and rotate in known manner about the longitudinal axis of the motor without leading to damaging jamming between the teeth.In addit4on, on the base of said blind cavity there is a ring 10 for the correct positioning of the shaft 9. The opposite or rear end of this latter is configured in the same manner as the end heretofore described, and fts external toothing engages with the internal circumferential toothing 11 of a normal lobed rotor 12.Said rotor comprises six arms or cusps, and is received in a stator 13 provided with seven flutes.Variable volume chambers are thus defined in known manner between said rotor 12 and stator 13, and are fed with pressurised oil as described hereinafter.On one and the other side of said motor unit 12, 13 as heretofore defined, there are provided an end piece 14 and a header 15 which are clamped in a sealed manner against the motor unit 12, 13 and against the casing 1 by robust screws 16 Figures 1, 3 and 4 .The header 15 has a central bore for the passage of the transmission shaft 9, and, as also shown in Figure 4, is provided circumferentially with seven equidistant longitudinal passages 17, of which those mouths facing the motor head piece 2 have a rectangular profile with rounded corners, and with a radially disposed longitudinal axis.In Figure 4 these mouths are shown with thick dashed lines, but the mouths can also assume a different shape from that shown.On the same face of the header 15 there are seven impressions 18 having the same profile and dimensions as said mouths and intercalated with these latter, they being shown in Figure 4 with thin dashed lines.Against the front face of the header 15 there rests a rotating coaxial ring of the distributor 19, which is provided internally with two diametrically opposing seats 20 Figure 4 holding respective end appendices of a coupling 21 which torsionally connects the rotating ring 19 to the motion output shaft 4 Figure 1 .As can be clearly seen, said coupling 21, which is commonly known as an Oldham coupling, is constituted essentially by a bush which comprises at its opposing ends two pairs of diametrically opposing longitudinal appendices or prolongations, the front ones being rotated through 900 relative to the rear ones. The coupling 21 is inserted into and torsionally locked to the output shaft 4 in the same manner as described for the rotating distribution ring 19.In contact with this latter there fs a fixed distribution ring 22 which embraces the Oldham coupling 21 and is sealed to the casing 1, with which it defines a torojdal hydraulic fluid outlet inlet chamber 23, according to the direction of rotation of the motor. Between the rings 19, 22 and the casing 1 there is also provided a second toroidal inlet outlet chamber 24 for the same fluid. Said two chambers communicate with respective connection ports 25, 26 provided in a raised portion 27 of the casing 1 Figures 1, 2 and 3 .In Figure 1 it can be also seen that the correct angular operating position of the fixed distributor ring 22 is determined by an elastic pin 28 fixed to the casing 1. This latter also comprises circumfe rentially equidistant blind bores which open into the toroidal chamber 24, and which house compression springs 29 arranged to keep the distributor unit 22, 19 pressed together tightly against the header 15 when the motor is stationary.The connections between the toroidal chambers 23, 24 and the respectively contracting and expanding variable volume chambers of the motor unit 12, 13 are made as follows.On the side associated with the toroidal chamber 23, the fixed ring 22 is provided with equidistant longitudinal bores 220 which open into a circumferential slot 221 provided in the opposite face of the fixed ring 22. Said slot 221 is disposed in front of a circumferential slot 190 in the rotating ring 19, this second slot being slightly wider than the preceding.From said slot 190 there extend six bores 191 which open into six cavities 192 provided in the opposite face of the rotating ring 19, their purpose being to successively cover the passages 17 and the impressions 18 in the header 15. As clearly shown fn Figure 4, these cavities are of isosceles trapezium configuration with their height disposed radially, and practically equal to the length of the elements 17 and 18, and having an average circumferential extension which is practically double the width of said elements.With the aforesaid six cavities 192 there are intercalated a further six cavities 192 from which there extend respective inclined bores 193 opening into the toroidal chamber 25 as shown in Figure 1. As stated, those thrust surfaces of the rings 22 and 19 which face the head piece 2 have an area which is greater than the area of those thrust surfaces which face the end piece 14, so that during the operation of the invention the distributor unit is constantly pressed tightly against the header 15.Finally, from the support seat for the motion output shaft 4 there extend at least two ducts 33, each of which is provided with a ball valve 34, and which open into the outlet and inlet ports 25, 26, their purpose being to discharge or recover any oil seepage in the direction of said seat, so as to prevent the seat coming under pressure, which would lead to imaginable damaging consequences.The described invention attains all the stated objects as is apparent from the aforegoing and from a simple examination of the accompanying figures.
