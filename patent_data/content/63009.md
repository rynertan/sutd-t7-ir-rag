# Skin or film packaging machine.

## Abstract
A skin packaging machine having a mechanism for raising and lowering the film frame. The mechanism in cludes a single vertical post 20 , a vertical shaft 25 alongside the post, a carriage assembly slidably mounted on the vertical shaft. A laterally projecting arm 35 and slide block 38 cooperate with a slide rail 44 on the vertical post to prevent the swivelling or rotating of the assembly as it rides up and down the shaft. A chain 55 passing around upper and lower sprockets is driven by a reversible alternat ing current motor 62 . The chain is preferably connected to the carriage assembly through two series connected springs 57, 58 . The springs serve as chain tensioners as well as shock absorbers in the event that the assembly, including the frame engages an object during its upward or downward excursion.
