# Full wave rectifier.

## Abstract
A full wave rectifier includes an operational amplifier 22 having an inverting terminal 36 connected to the emitter of a transistor 30 . A first resistor 32 is connected between a first power source VCC and the collector of the transistor 30 . A second resitor 34 is connected between a second power source VEE and the emitter of the transistor 30 . When the first and second resistors have an identical value and first and second power sources have same absolute voltage but oppo site polarity, the voltage on the transistor collector represents the rectification of the voltage VIN applied to the non inverting input 24 of the operational amplifier 22 .
