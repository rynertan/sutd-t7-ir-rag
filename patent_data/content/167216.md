# Rotary engine cooling system.

## Abstract
A rotary engine has a substantially trochoidal shaped housing cavity 24 in which a rotor planetates. The cooling system for the engine directs coolant through the housing along a path consisting of series connected groups of passages. Coolant enters near the engine air intake port 34 , passes downwardly and axially through the cooler regions 62 of the engine, then passes upwardly and axially through the hotter regions 74 near the spark plug. By first flowing through the coolest regions, coolant pressure is reduced, thus reducing the saturation temperature of the coolant and thereby enhancing the nucleate boiling heat transfer mechanism which predominates in the high heat flux region of the engine during high power level operation. The coolant flows in the opposite direction to rotor rotation, and flows downwardly through the coolest regions and upwardly through the hottest regions, the coolant inlet 36 and outlet 38 being together at the top of the housing.
