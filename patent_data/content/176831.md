# Fast response, high rate, gas diffusion electrode and method of making same.

## Abstract
Disclosed are gas fed, porous electrodes capable of steady, high current density operation for practical periods of service, e.g. as oxygen cathodes in metal air batteries. The subject electrodes feature at least two bonded composite layers, one of which is a form stable, conductive wetproofing layer while the other is an unusually thin active layer containing active carbon particles predominantly between about 2 and about 20 micrometers and having a high internal surface area, e.g. a B.E.T. surface area of over 1000 mÂ² gram. A simple and highly successful method of preparing such electrodes is also disclosed, which avoids the necessity of separately forming and handling the thin active layer.
