## Description
Cyanine Dyes For Sensitizing Silver Halide Emulsions To Infrared Radiation And Photographic Elements Including Them Field of Invention The present invention relates to photography and particularly to sensitizing dyes for use with photographic emulsions and elements which are to be sensitized in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum approximately 700 to 900 nm . Particularly, the present invention relates to dyes useful in sensitizing silver halide emulsions for photographic elements to be exposed to infrared radiation in the region near 800 nm. Background Of The Art Dyes for sensitizing gelatin silver halide emulsions to be included in photographic elements for exposure to infrared rays are known in the art. They normally include two heterocyclic nuclei linked to each other by a long conjugated methine chain, having, for example, 7, 9 or 11 carbon atoms. Each of the two heterocyclic nuclei are attached at the ends of such a methine chain, particularly through a carbon atom attached to an alkyl substituted nitrogen atom. One sensitizing dye of this kind can be described as including a resonance chain of the amidinium ion type, as described in Mees and James, The Theory Of The Photographic Process , third edition, 1966, p. 201. Such a resonance chain or resonance system is made of two nitrogen atoms alkyl group substituted at the ends of a conjugated methine chain, one of which is positively charged. Such a conjugated methine chain is partially within the skeleton of said nitrogen containing heterocyclic nuclei. When speaking in the art, however, about conjugated methine chains between two heterocyclic nuclei, having 7, 9 or 11 carbon atoms, the methine groups of the chain within the heterocyclic nucleus skeleton are not considered in the counting of methine groups they are normally present as one group, as in benzothiazole and 2 pyridine dyes, or two groups, as in 4 pyridine dyes .The above numbers 7, 9 or 11 thus indicate only the carbon atoms of the conjugated methine chain skeleton which bridges said two heterocyclic nuclei. It is assumed that the point of attachment of the chain to the heterocyclic nucleus is at a carbon atom directly or indirectly attached to the nitrogen atom of the amidinium ion resonance chain, indirectly meaning attached only through a sequence of two conjugated carbon atoms. As known, the nature of the atoms, which form the heterocyclic nucleus, as well as the nature of the substituents attached thereto and the alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom itself, and the length and nature of the methine chain between said heterocyclic nuclei have affects on such resonance and on various characteristics of the resulting dyes. It is known, for example, that heavier heterocyclic nuclei as well as longer chains cause a bathochromic effect on sensitization peaks. It is further known that such long chains may be associated with lack of stability unless they are rigidized by substituting the 2nd through 4th or 3rd through 5th methine groups in with carbon atoms respectively to form a 6 or 5 membered carbon ring. Reference can be made to U.S. Patent No. 2,734,900 describing chains rigidized on a 6 membered ring and to U.S. Patent Nos. 3,482,978 and 3,758,461 and GB 1,188,784 describing chains rigidized on a five membered ring. Such heterocyclic nuclei linked together through said methine chain may be chosen among those 5, 6 or 7 membered heterocyclics comprised of C, N, S, 0 and Se ring atoms which may also have fused on benzene or naphthalene rings known in the art such as, for example, thiazole, benzothiazole, 1,2 d naphthothiazole, 2,1 d naphthothiazole, oxazole, benzoxazole, selenazole, benzoselenazoline, 1,2 d naphthoselenazole, 2,1 d naphthoselenazole, thiazoline, oxazoline, selenazoline, 2 quinoline, 2 pyridine, 3,3 dialkyl indolenine, 4 quinoline, 4 pyridine, imidazole and benzimidazole. Various substituents can be attached to each of them in their various reactive positions as known in the art.Such substituents and their position can be chosen to introduce desired variations into the characteristics of the dyes and their sensitization properties, such as stability, solubility and sensitization peak. In spite of the many experiments made in the art, however, the capability of such dyes to sensitize the silver halide emulsions to the infrared rays still remains unsatisfactory. Summary Of The Invention Cyanine dyes including two heterocyclic nuclei linked to each other by a rigidized methine chain, having 7, 9 or 11 carbon atoms, are very good for sensitizing silver halide emulsions included in photographic elements for exposure to infrared radiation, if one of said heterocyclic nuclei is 5 methyl 6 methoxy benzothiazole. Detailed Description Of The Invention Efforts to obtain dyes for infrared sensitizing of photographic silver halide gelatin emulsions and improving the sensitivity of emulsions, as well as an improved sensitivity to fog ratio, to manufacture photographic elements for exposure to infrared radiation have led to the preparation of new dyes which showed unexpected good properties when sensitizing silver halide emulsions.Such dyes are a novel subclass of the general type known in the art which includes two heterocyclic nuclei linked to each other by a conjugated methine chain to form what is called an amidinium ion resonance system. Such dyes are particularly good according to the present invention if they include a benzothiazole nucleus having both a 5 methyl and a 6 methoxy substituent attached thereto. It has been found, in fact, that the combination of a long rigidized chain with a 5 methyl 6methoxy benzothiazole nucleus with or without additional substitution provides stable dyes having a high sensitizing power in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum for silver halide emulsion grains associated therewith.It has been also found that photographic elements including such emulsion grains associated with the dyes of the present invention, dispersed in a gelatin layer, give very good results concerning sensitivity to fog ratio when exposed and conventionally processed. The present invention thus refers to cyanine dyes including two nitrogen containing heterocyclic nuclei linked to each other through a rigidized conjugated methine chain to form an amidinium ion resonance system characterized by the fact that such chain has 7, 9 or 11 carbon atoms and at least one of said nuclei is a 5 methyl 6 methoxybenzothiazole nucleus. The present invention particularly refers to dyes including such 5 methyl 6 methoxy benzothiazole nucleus combined with another heterocyclic nucleus chosen within those of the thiazole series, benzothiazole series, 1,2 d naphthothiazole series, 2,1 d naphthothiazole series, oxazole series, benzoxazole series, selenazole series, benzoselenazole series, 1,2 d naphthoselenazole series, 2,1 d naphthoselenazole series, thiazoline series, oxazoline series, selenazoline series, 2 quinoline series, 4 quinoline series, 2 pyridine series, 4 pyridine series, 3,3 dialkyl indolenine series wherein alkyl has a meaning known to those skilled in the art including alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms , imidazole series and benzimidazole series. More particularly and preferably, the present invention refers to dyes of the type above indicated in which both heterocyclic nuclei are of the benzothiazole series. Still particularly, the present invention refers to the dyes above in which the rigidized methine chain has 7 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the present invention refers to sensitizing dyes as described above in which one heterocyclic nucleus is a 5 methyl 6 methoxy benzothiazole and the other is unsubstituted benzothiazole. Particularly, the present invention refers to the above dyes in which part of said rigidized chain is included in a rigidizing nucleus structure made of 5 or 6 carbon atoms. More preferably, said chain rigidizing nucleus is a cyclohexene nucleus substituted or not .Still more preferably, said chain rigidizing nucleus is an exocyclic nitrogen substituted cyclopentene nucleus, wherein said nitrogen bears two substituents attached thereto which may form a further ring attached to said pentene nucleus, as hereinafter illustrated by structural formulae and by a more detailed description. The present invention refers to photographic emulsions including gelatin and silver halide grains dispersed therein, characterized by having said grains associated with the above sensitizing dyes to make them sensitive to infrared radiation. The present invention also refers to photographic elements for exposure with infrared radiation sources, especially those of about 800 nm, including a support base and a gelatin emulsion layer containing silver halide grains in sensitizing association with the above dyes. Most of the dyes of the present invention can be usefully described by making reference to the following structural formulae EMI6.1 wherein R and R1 can be a substitued alkyl group or a non substituted alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, benzyl, octyl, carboxy methyl, carboxyethyl, sulfopropyl, carboxypropyl, carboxy butyl, sulfoethyl, sulfoisopropyl and sulfobutyl groups X is any acid anion such as, for example, chloride, bromide, iodide, perchlorate, sulfamate, thiocyanate, p toluenesulfonate and benzensulfonate Z and Z1 are independently the non metallic atoms necessary to complete an aromatic heterocyclic nucleus chosen within the group of those known in the art to make sensitizing dyes including an amidinium ion resonance system, as already indicated, particularly those of the described series including proper substituents attached thereto as known in the art with the proviso that at least one of the formed nuclei is a 5 methyl 6 methoxy benzothiazole nucleus Z2 are the atoms necessary to complete a six carbon nucleus, particularly a nucleus of the following type EMI7.1 as understood, such Z2 nucleus has to include conjugated methine groups within the dye resonance methine chain with the exclusion of groups or bonds which can interfere with such chain, for example by substracting electrons m is 1, 2 or 3 and n or r are each 0 or 1 andEMI7.2 wherein R, R1, m, n, r, Z and Zl have the same meaning as before A is a carbon atoms substituted with a disubstituted N atom,EMI7.3 such substituents R2 and R3 each preferably being a substituted alkyl group or non substituted alkyl having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, dodecyl an alkoxycarbamyl alkyl group including no more than 12 carbon atoms such as methoxycarbamylmethyl, ethoxycarbamylethyl an aryl group such as substituted phenyl group and non substituted phenyl as, for example, m or p tolyl, m or p chlorophenyl, m or p alkoxyphenyl, wherein the alkoxy group contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as m propoxyphenyl, m butoxyphenyl, p methoxyphenyl, p ethoxyphenyl, p propoxyphenyl, p butoxy phenyl.Such N substituents, taken together, may be the non metallic atoms necessary to complete a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic nucleus such as pyrrolidyl, piperidyl, morpholylgroups or N substituted piperazinyl groups, the nitrogen atom thereof being preferably substituted with a substituted alkly group or non substituted alkyl as described before for R2 and R3 substituents and Z3 means the carbon atoms necessary to form a 5 carbon rigidized nucleus each of them having attachedR4 and R5 groups each representing hydrogen, alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, ethylethoxy, propyl, isopropyl and butyl, halogen such as chlorine or bromine, alkoxy groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy and butoxy groups.The preferred 5 carbon rigidized nucleus of formula II including both A and Z3, as described, can be represented by the following formula EMI8.1 wherein the respective meanings of R2, R3, R4 and R5 have been given above It is to be noted that with dyes of structure formula I , the Z nucleus is not equivalent, or symmetrical, with respect to the Z1 nucleus, Z1 is linkd to Z2 by only one methine group, included therebetween, while there are at least 3 methine groups between Z and Z2.Preferred compounds within this invention have Z1 equal to 5 methyl 6 methoxy benzothiazole, as described hereinabove. With reference to the substituents present in Z and Zl nuclei, they are well known to those skilled in the art both in general and with particular reference to the considered nucleus series. They are to be chosen as to introduce desired characteristics to the molecule, as known in the art, to meet particular objectives of interest. The above, of course, is true also for the various substituents of the dye molecule and for the choice of the heterocyclic Z, Zl Z2 and Z3 nucleus configuration, the choice of Z and Z1 which we will call resonant heterocyclic nuclei to distinguish them from other heterocyclic nuclei present in the dye molecule being particularly important in determining the sensitizing region of the dyes themselves.The present invention will be particularly described with reference to individual problems. The first desired photographic element, for example, was to be a conventional black and white silver halide photographic element for exposure to infrared radiation at about 800 nm and processible, after exposure, in conventional black and white developer and fixer baths. In elements of this type, it is not absolutely required that the dyes are completely washed away from the element during processing. Accordingly, there were no reasons to manufacture dyes having R and R1 including solubilizing groups such as carboxy and sulfoxy groups. It is not excluded, however, that other photographic elements might require such water solubility. That is the normal case in color photographic elements where said silver halide emulsion grains dispersed in gelatin are associated with color forming couplers to form dyes upon color development with p phenylene diamine developers as well known in the art .
