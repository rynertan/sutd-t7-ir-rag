## Description
BIPHENYLS AND THEIR USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF LIQUID CRYSTAL MATERIALS Liquid crystal materials which are of the type known in the art as chiral nematic materials generally consist of one or more chiral nematogenic compounds which are optically active compounds exhibiting the property or tendency of forming liquid crystal phases. These materials may be used for example in various kinds of electro optical device employing appropriate effects, eg the so called phase change effect. They may also be used in various temperature sensing applications involving the selective reflection of radiation of different wavel,engths dependent on temperature. For such temperature sensing applications the selective reflection preferably. occurs in the visible spectral region. According to the present invention in a first aspect a novel fluorobiphenyl suitable for use in the preparation of chiral nematogenic compounds has a formula EMI1.1 Formula I whereinEMI1.2 represents a 4 biphenylyl radical carrying a fluorine substituent in at least one lateral position R1 is an optically active alkyl group cH3.C112.CH CH3 CH2 n where n is an integer in the range 0 to 6. Preferably, the compound is a separate optically active isomer. Preferably n is the range 1 to 6, desirably n 1. The symbol indicates an optically active group showing a positive optical rotation angle. Preferably, fluorine is present in the 2 or 2 position the group R1 being in the 4 position . Although laterally fluorinated 4 alkylbiphenyls are known such compounds have not hitherto been suggested in a form in which the terminal alkyl group is a chiral group, ie contains an optically active centre. According to the present invention in a second aspect there is provided the use of a compound of Formula I in the preparation of chiral nematogenic compounds suitable for use in chiral nematic liquid crystal materials. Examples of chiral nematogenic compounds which may be prepared from the biphenyls of Formula I are the compounds ofFormula II as follows EMI2.1 Formula II wherein R2 is n alkyl, and X and Y are selected from H and F, at least one being F. Liquid crystalline compounds synthesised from compounds of Formula I unexpectedly can have advantageous properties, eg can show selective reflection of light at room temperature as exemplified below. Compounds of Formula I may be produced by the route EMI3.1 Examples of the preparation and properties of compounds of Formulae I and II given above will now be described by way of example.
