# Electromagnetic surveying of pipes and cables.

## Abstract
Apparatus for locating or monitoring the condition of an inaccessible conductor 10 comprises an antenna for receiv ing electrical signals due to an alternating current in the conductor. The antenna comprises at least two transducer assemblies AB, CD each comprising two horizontal, prefer ably mutually perpendicular, transducers A and B C and D preferably ferrite cored coils . The signals induced in the transducers A D can be processed to give information about the current in the conductor 10 indicative of its con dition or its depth, independently of the antenna orienta tion. Use of more assemblies A F can give better sensitiv ity. Assemblies including a vertical transducer X, Y can avoid the need for the antenna to be over the conductor.
