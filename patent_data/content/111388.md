# Therapeutic compounds of platinum and palladium and their preparation.

## Abstract
Platinum and palladium compositions for use as antitry panosomal and antitumour agents in mammals are made by bonding cis platinium II and cis palladium II moieties having amine substituents to anionic macromolecular en tities. The more highly complexed compositions are insolu ble in water and particularly adapted for in situ implantation into tumourous masses.
