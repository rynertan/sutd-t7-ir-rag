## Description
POLYETHYLENE COMPOSITIONS OF HIGH IMPACT STRENGTH The present invention relate. to polyethylene compositions of high impact strength and especially to compositions of polyethylene with certain ethylene copolymers in which the ethylene copolymers are present as discrete particles within the matrix of polyethylene. Polyethylene, for example homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and higher alphaolefins, are used in large volumes for a variety of end uses, e.g. in the form of film, fibres, moulded or thermoformed articles, pipe, coatings and the like. In some instances, the articles fabricated from the polyethylene must exhibit impact resistant properties such articles are usually fabricated using injection moulding or thermoforming processes, or the like. One method of altering the properties of polyethylene is to blend the polyethylene with a second polymer0 For instance, it is disclosed in U.R. Patent 582 093 of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, which was accepted 1946 November 05, that copolymers of ethylene and organic vinyl esters may be incorporated into polyethylene to improve the properties of the polyethylene. Compositions of polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate are also disclosed in Canadian Patents 823 715 of H.R.Larson et al., which issued 1969 September 23, and 837 709 of B.P. Holladay et al., which issued 1970 March 24. A process of rotationally moulding objects of high stress crack resistance and compatibility from compositions of high density polyethylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3 784 668 of W.K. Neidinger, which issued 1974 January 08. It has now been found that compositions of polyethylene and certain ethylene copolymers exhibit high impact strength. Accordingly, the present invention provides a melt fabricable composition comprising a blend of A 60 to 90 by weight of the composition of a polyethylene selected from the group consisting of homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and at least one C4 C10 hydrocarbon alpha olefin, and mixtures thereof, said polyethylene having a density of at least 0.935 g cm3 and a melt index in the range of 0.5 to 60 dg min., and B 10 to 40 by weight of the composition of an ethylene copolymer selected from the group consisting of copolymers of ethylene with at least one of vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, alkyl esters of acrylic acid and alkyl esters of methacrylic acid, said copolymer having a comonomer content of 18 to 40 by weight and a melt index in the range of 2 to 30 dg min0, with the proviso that the shear viscosity of the polyethylene, as measured at 2200C and at a shear rate of 400 sec l, is 0.5 to 2.0 times the shear viscosity of the ethylene copolymer, the ethylene copolymer being in the form of discrete particles in a matrix of the polyethylene, said particles having an average diameter of 0.1 to 3.0 pm, said composition having a notched Izod impact strength as measured by the procedure of ASTM D 256 of at least 3.0 times that of said polyethylene in the absence of ethylene copolymer and a flexural modulus as measured by the procedure of ASTM D 790 of at least 550 MPa, said composition having a snake flow in the range of 16 to 40 cm. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ethylene copolymer is an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer0 The present invention also provides a process for forming a melt fabricable composition comprising the steps of i feeding to an extruder A 60 to 90 by weight of the composition of a polyethylene selected from the group consisting of homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and at least one C Clo hydrocarbon alpha olefin, and mixtures thereof, said polyethylene having a density of at least 0.935 g cm3 and a melt index in the range of 0.5 to 60 dg min0, and B 10 to 40 by weight of the composition of an ethylene copolymer selected from the group consisting of copolymers of ethylene with at least one of vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, alkyl esters of acrylic acid and alkyl esters of methacrylic acid, said copolymer having a comonomer content of 18 to 40 by weight, a melt index in the range of 2 to 30 dg min., with the proviso that the shear viscosity of the polyethylene, as measured at 220etc and at a shear rate of 400 sec l, is 0.5 to 2,0 times the shear viscosity of the ethylene copolymer, ii intensively mixing the blend so obtained at a temperature in the range of 180 to 2600C to produce a composition that, when cooled to ambient temperature, a has the ethylene copolymer in the form of discrete particles in a matrix of polyethylene, said particles having an average mean diameter of 0.1 to 3.0 pm, b has a notchedIzod impact strength as measured by the procedure of ASTMD 256 at 230C of at least 3.0 times that of said polyethylene in the absence of ethylene copolymer and a flexural modulus as measured by the procedure of ASTMD 790 of at least 550 MPa, and c has a snake flow in the range of 16 to 40 cm, and iii extruding the molten composition in the form of a shaped article. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, the shaped article is in the form of pellets, granules or the like. The polyethylene of the composition may be a homopolymer of ethylene and or a copolymer of ethylene and at least one C4 C10 hydrocarbon alpha olefin, for example a copolymer of ethylene and a minor amount of butene l, hexene l and or octene l. Techniques for the manufacture of such polymers are known in the art in an embodiment the homopolymers and copolymers are linear polymers manufactured by polymerization of monomer in the presence of a coordination catalyst. The polyethylene has a density of at least 0.935 g cm3, especially in the range of 0.935 to 0.965 g cm3 and in particular in the range of 0.945 to 0.965 g cm3. In addition, the polyethylene has a melt index in the range of 0.5 to 60 dg min, especially 10 to 40 dg min. Melt index is measured by the procedure of ASTM D 1238 Condition E . The density and melt index of the polyethylene will depend in particular on the intended end use of articles melt fabricated from the compositions. If the polyethylene is a polymer of narrow molecular weight distribution, it is preferred that the melt index of the polyethylene be at least 10 dg min. The compositions contain 60 to 90 , by weight of the composition, of polyethylene, preferably 70 to 85 by weight and especially 75 to 85 by weight of polyethylene. Conversely, the compositions contain 10 to 40 , by weight of the composition, of ethylene copolymer, preferably 15 to 30 and especially 15 to 25 by weight of ethylene copolymer. The ethylene copolymer of the composition is a copolymer of ethylene with at least one of vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, alkyl esters of acrylic acid and alkyl esters of methyacrylic acid. The preferred copolymer is a copolymer of ethylene with vinyl acetate. The copolymers have a comonomer content of 18 to 40 by weight, especially 20 to 30t by weight, and a melt index in the range of 2 to 30 dg min, especially 5 to 25 dg min. The polyethylene and the ethylene copolymer should have shear viscosities that are similar under the melt conditions used, in the extruder, during the formation of the compositions of the present invention. The temperature used in the extruder will normally be in the range of 180 to 2600C and the shear rates in the extruder will normally be about 200 to 600 sec lt as used herein the shear viscosities of the polyethylene and of the ethylene copolymer are measured at a temperature of 220 C and a shear rate of 400 sec1. The ratio of the shear viscosity of the polyethylene to that of the ethylene copolymer should be in the range of 0.5 to 2.0, especially in the range of 0.75 to 1.33 and in particular in the range of 0.9 to 1.11. In the compositions of the present invention, the ethylene copolymer is in the form of discrete particles ih the matrix of the polyethylene. Such particles may be observed in cross sections of the composition when viewed with, for example, a scanning electron microscope at magnifications of about 5000x or above. The particles of ethylene copolymer have an average mean diameter of 0.1 to 3.0 um and especially 0.2 to 2.0 um. As is illustrated hereinafter, compatible blends of polyethylene and ethylene copolymers that do not have discrete particles of ethylene copolymer in a polyethylene matrix, exhibit inferior impact strength as measured by notched Izod impact strength.Notched Izod impact strength is measured by the procedure of ASTn D 256. In preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention have a notched Izod impact strength, as measured at 230C, of greater than 3.2 Joules cm and especially greater than 5.0 Joules cm. Moreover, the notched Izod impact strength of the composition is at least three times that of the polyethylene in the absence of ethylene copolymer in the oomposition. In addition, the compositions have a flexural modulus of at least 550 MPa and especially at least 650 MPa. Flexural modulus is measured by the procedure of ASTM D 790. The compositions of the invention have a snake flow in the range of 16 to 40 cm. As used herein, snake flow also known as grid flow number is determined using anS shaped flow mould of substantially rectangular crosssection, having a channel depth of 0.1 cm and a channel width of 1.25 cm. The mould has a surface finish of ASA 16 on the fixed side and ASA 4 on the polished cavity. The length of the flow path is measured from the gate of the mould. Steps should be taken to obtain optimal uniformity in the determination of snake flow, especially of temperature of the polymer. The snake flow specimens were moulded using the mould described above and an Engel injection moulding machine at a melt nozzle temperature of 2200C using the following cycle inject and hold 6 seconds , cool 16 seconds , open 1 second and eject and close 1 second .Snake flow is reported as an average of ten measurements. The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by feeding the polyethylene and ethylene copolymer to an extruder adapted to intensively mix the resulting blend of polymers. In the extruder, the blend is intensively mixed at a temperature of 180 to 2600C. While it is possible to use a single screw extruder equipped with a mixing screw and a suitable hoLd up time, it is preferred that twin screw extruders or other high fluxing mixers be used in the preparation of the compositions of the present invention. The intensively mixed compositions of the present invention are then extruded into shaped articles.The shaped articles will usually be pellets, granules or the like, although other fabricated articles may be made directly from the molten composition. If the compositions are intended for moulding processes, especially injection moulding processes, the compositions would normally be extruded in a comminuted form and subsequently subjected to the moulding process. The compositions of the present invention may be formed using concentrates. For example, a concentrate of ethylene copolymer in polyethylene having a ratio of polyethylene ethylene copolymer of at least 4 6 by weight may be prepared e.g. by admixing the polyethylene and ethylene copolymer under melt conditions and extruding the resultant concentrate in the form of pellets or the like. The concentrate is then blended with additional polyethylene to form a composition of the invention. If the compositions are prepared using a concentrate, the melt processing apparatus subsequently used e.g. an extruder, should be capable of mixing the concentrate and polyethylene to form a composition of uniform properties. The compositions of the invention may additionally contain stabilizers, pigments and other additives known for polyethylene compositions. The compositions of the present invention may be used in the melt fabrication of articles intended for a variety of end uses. For instance, the compositions may be injection moulded or rotationally moulded to form articles having a high impact strength. An example of such an article is a grass catcher, for a lawn mower, where impact resistance to propelled objects is an important property. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples Example I Compositions were prepared from SCLAIR 2909 ethylene homopolymer, having a density of 0.960 g cm3 and a melt index of 13.5 dg min, and an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer using a Wilmod single screw extruder. The screw speed used was 100 rpm and melt temperatureUs were 180 to 2200C. The ethylene copolymer viz. ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, had a vinyl acetate content of 258 by weight, a melt index of 19 dg min and a flexural modulus of 18 MPa.The ratio of shear viscosities, measured at 2200C and A00 sec 1, for polyethylene copolymer was 1.6 1. denotes trade mark The resultant compositions were tested as follows a particle size of the copolymer in the polyethylene matrix was measured with a scanning electron microscope b notched Izod impact strength was measured at 23 C and 40 C using the procedure of ASTM D 256. The bars used, which were injection moulded at 220eC, had a thickness of 0.32 cm.The letters shown in brackets in Table I hereinafter describe the type of break as follows C complete break, H hinge break, P partial break,NB no break c flexural modulus was measured at 230C using the procedure of ASTM D 790 d snake flow was measured by the method described above and e dart drop was measured according to the procedure of ASTM D 3029 82a using a dart having weight of 2724g and a diameter of 2.54 cm. The thickness of the sample used was 0.25 cm. The samples passed the dart drop test when there was no penetration of the dart through the sample. The results, which are given in Table I, show the improvement obtained with compositions of the present invention. The effect of processing temperature is also shown. Example II The procedure of Example I was repeated using an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate content of 28 by weight, a melt index of 6 dg min and a flexural modulus of 14 MPa. The ratio of the shear viscosities, measured at 2200C and 400 sec l, for polyethylene copolymer was 1.3 1. The results obtained are given in Table II, Runs 9 to 12. Example III The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate content of 28 by weight, a melt index of 25 dg min and a flexural modulus of 10.3 MPa. The ratio of the shear viscosities, measured at 2200C and 400 sec l, for polyethylene t copolymer was 2.6V1. The results obtained are given in Table II, Runs 13 to 16. These results, especially notched Izod impact strength at 23 C, are inferior to those of Example II thus showing the effect of the more closely matched melt viscosities of the components of the compositions of Example II. Example IV As a comparison, the procedure of Example I was repeated using an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate content of 9t by weight, a melt index of 7 dg min and a flexural modulus of 86 MPa. The ratio of the shear viscosities, measured at 2200C and 400 sec l, for polyethylene t copolymer was 1.5 1. The results obtained are given in Table III, Runs 17 to 20. The notched Izod impact strength at 230C was substantially inferior to that obtained in, for example,Example II in which particles of copolymer were present in the polyethylene matrix. Example V As a further comparison, the procedure of ExampleI was repeated using an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate content of 9 by weight, a melt index of 20 dg min and a flexural modulus of 130 MPa. The ratio of the shear viscosities, measured at 2200C and 400 sec1, for polyethylene copolymer was 2.0 1. The results obtained are given in Table III, Runs 21 to 24. The notched Izod impact strength at 23 C was inferior to that obtained in, for example, Example II. Example VI To show effects of differences in the mixing of the components of the composition, a composition of 80 by weight of SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene and 20 by weight of the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer of Example III was prepared using different mixing equipment. Further details and the results obtained are given in Table IV. The notched Izod impact strength obtained for compositions prepared on twin screw extruders were superior to those for compositions prepared on a single screw extruder. The composition prepared by physical blending only gave substantially poorer results. Example VII A series of compositions of SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene and the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer of Example II were prepared at a melt temperature of 2200C using a twinscrew extruder. The results in Table V show the effects of composition on the notched Izod impact strength.

Example IX A series of compositions were prepared using polyethy lenes having different densities but the same melt flow properties. viz. all of the polyethylenes were classified as having snake flows of 17.8 cm. The polyethylenes used were as follows SCLAIR 2912 .... density 0.960 g cm3, melt index 30 dg min SCLAIR 2712 .... density 0.950 g cm3, melt index 33 dg min SCLAIR 2512 .... density 0.940 g cm3, melt index 31 dg min The ethylene copolymer was copolymer C of Example VI II. The results for SCLAIR 2712 and 2512 are reported in Table VII, and the results for SCLAIR 2912 are reported as Runs 42 45 in Table VI. The shear viscosities of the polyethy lene and ethylene copolymer are believed to be similar.

Example X A concentrate of SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene 60 by weight and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer 40 by weight was prepared using a Welding Engineers twin screw extruder the ethylene copolymer was copolymer B of Example VIII. The resultant concentrate, in pellet form, was blended in a ratio of 1 1 with additional SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene. As a comparison, a composition containing SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene 80 by weight and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer 20 by weight i.e. the same as the composition above after blending, was prepared using the WeldingEngineers twin screw extruder. Notched Izod impact strength and flexural modulus were measured on the blend and on the composition. The results obtained were as follows Run No. Sample Notched Izod Flexural Modulus Joules cm MPa 230C 40 C 58 Blend 5.3 0.64 715 59 Composition 5.6 0.53 718 The properties of the blend and composition are believed to be equivalent within experimental error, thereby illustrating that compositions of the invention may be prepared from concentrates. Example XI A series of compositions of the invention were prepared by blending SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene with ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer that contained 20 of methyl acrylate comonomer the copolymer had a density of 0.942 g cm3 and a melt index of 6 dg min. The compositions were prepared by blending the polyethylene and ethylene copolymer viz. ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer, in a WeldingEngineers twin screw extruder at melt temperatures of 2200C or 2500C.

The particles had a diameter of about 1 micron, or less. Example XII A series of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, having different amounts of vinyl acetate comonomer, were blended into SCLAIR 2909 polyethylene. Each blend contained 80t by weight of polyethylene and 20 by weight of ethylene copolymer. The resultant compositions were subjected to flexural modulus and notched Izod impact tests and also studied using a scanning electron microscope.

The composition having the 15 vinyl acetate copolymer exhibited a notched Izod impact strength superior to compositions of lower vinyl acetate content but inferior to compositions of higher vinyl acetate content, and is believed to represent the transition zone between these two types of compositions. The scanning electron microscope showed significant differences in the compositions. Compositions formed with copolymers having 18 28 vinyl acetate copolymer showed particles of ethylene copolymer in the polyethylene matrix whereas compositions with 9 and 12 vinyl acetate copolymer did not. The composition with 15 vinyl acetate copolymer did not appear to have particles of ethylene copolymer in the polyethylene matrix but the micrographs obtained from the scanning electron microscope were different in appearance to those obtained with the compositions of lower vinyl acetate content this may be evidence of a transition zone in the structure of the composition. Example XIII Using the procedure of Run 25 of Example VI, compositions of SCLAIR 2906M6 polyethylene and an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a density of 0.951 g cm3, a melt index of 3.0 dg min and a vinyl acetate content of 28 by weight were prepared. The polyethylene had a density of 0.960 g cm3, a melt index of 0.75 dg min, a snake flow of 15.2 cm and a broad molecular weight distribution.
