# SURFACE TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A thermally insulating layer 23 is applied to the inner surface of a mold wall 10 to control the heating and cooling of the mold. Its thickness and thermal properties are chosen so that at least half the temperature drop across the mold wall is in the surface layer. To increase the thermal insula tion hollow spheres 24 are included in the layer. Graphite fibres 25A provide reinforcement against cracking due to thermal cycling. In the case shown they form a conductive mat for electrical resistance heating of the layer but the layer is also useful when the heat comes from the material in troduced into the mould. A thin fibrous paper layer 26 can be included in addition.
