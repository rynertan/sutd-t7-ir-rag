## Abstract
There is described a process for for neutralizing halogen and or acids released during processing of polymeric materi als having thermally releasable acidic components and or additives, which may release halogen and or acids during processing to final products. The composition of matter is selected from a genus of multimetallic compounds having a hydroxyl content.
