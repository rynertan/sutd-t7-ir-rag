# Burnable neutron absorbers.

## Abstract
A neutron absorber body for use in burnable poison rods in a nuclear reactor. The body is composed of a matrix of Al₂O₃ containing B₄C, the neutron absorber. Areas of high density polycrystalline Al₂O₃ particles are predominantly encircled by pores in some of which there are B₄C particles. This body is produced by initially spray drying a slurry of Al₂O₃ powder to which a binder has been added. The powder of agglomerated spheres of the Al₂O₃ with the binder are dry mixed with B₄C powder. The mixed powder is formed into a green body by isostatic pressure and the green body is sintered. The sintered body is processed to form the neutron absorber body. In this case the B₄C particles are separate from the spheres resulting from the spray drying instead of being embedded in the sphere.
