# A semiconductor device comprising an alpha rays shielding layer.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device containing an α rays shielding resin layer 7 on at least active portion 12 of a semiconduc tor element 5 , said α rays shielding resin being a special poly imide resin, is excellent in thermal resistance at the time of sealing the semiconductor element 5 , adhesion of the α rays shielding layer 7 to the semiconductor element 5 , and α rays shielding ability.
