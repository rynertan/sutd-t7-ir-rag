# Filter cigarette.

## Abstract
A filter cigarette 10 is provided which comprises a tobacco rod which includes a charge of tobacco 12 wrapped in cigarette paper 13 , an integral, axially aligned wrapped cylindrical filter plug 14 , and tipping paper 20 . The filter plug is divided into first 18 and second 19 segments with the first segment being rotatable with respect to the second segment. Rotation of the first segment with respect to the second segment causes axial movement of the first segment which serves to vary the air dilution value of the cigarette by uncovering a permeable region 26 in the plug wrapping 15 .
