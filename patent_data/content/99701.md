# Process and apparatus for converting olefins into gasoline and distillate.

## Abstract
The economics and thermal efficiency of a process for converting olefins into gasoline and distillate over a zeolite catalyst is improved by separating the effluent product into gas and liquid phases, cooling the gas phase to form additional liquid and heat exchanging that additional liquid with the overhead gas from the separator.
