# Ultrasonic injection nozzles.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic fuel injection nozzle 1 includes an ultraso nic vibration generating means 100 , an elongated vibrating element 12 connected at one end to said vibrating element 12 , and having an edged portion 26 at its other end composed of steps of decreasing diameter for atomizing fuel at the circular edges thereof, and a liquid fuel feeding means 38, 36, 34, 32, 28 for feeding liquid fuel to said edged portion 26 . A solenoid valve 38 controls the flow of fuel independently of its pressure.
