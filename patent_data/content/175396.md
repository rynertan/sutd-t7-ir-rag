# Outlet construction having talus protecting properties for tube ducts, in general, and drain ditches, in particular.

## Abstract
A talus protecting outlet construction consisting of three parts for tube ducts whereby the tube part can be connected in a tensile resistant manner with the drain tube 2 , opens out in a talus, and is surrounded through the combination of a ball hinge head 10 and a talus gutter 9 so that the talus cannot be affected by the discharging water, whilst a swallow tail shaped sectional area of the gutter 9 has a self fixing effect on the entire gutter length and the spherical ball hinge head allows an angular turn between the gutter and the tube.

## Description
Outlet construction having talus protecting properties for tube ducts, in general, and drain ditches, in particular. The invention relates to a tube outlet drain consisting of three parts, talus protecting and being practically mountable on the actual drainage methods completely surrounding the tube in a manner such that the talus will in no way be affected by the draining water, lying sunk self fixing in the talus so that mowing the talus vegetation and cleaning of the water gutter will not be hindered, whilst a ball hinge head connects the talus gutter with the drain tube so that a limited angular turn in all directions of the tube is possible and a firm entity is obtained. Such constructions are known as talus end tubes of the typeKleverskerke, type De Haan and the like, all having, however, the disadvantage that the gutter is not self fixing and that the angular turn both in the talus slope and in the inset direction are not or hardly possible. The Dutch Patent Application 7614163 describing Protection of tube outlets in talus serving plate body provides an excessively expensive construction and application and the region of use will be limited to large tube diameters. The Draining ditch headwall unit described in European Patent Application 0000788 had the purpose of providing a non hindering talus protection, the disadvantage of which is the expensive structure and the application will take very much time, whilst for any angular turn various manipulations will be required.This means that the construction will not be suitable for a general use of drain outlets. The invention has for its object to provide a protection of talus at drain tube outlets of water courses, in which in an advantageous manner a great number of practical problems are solved and all disadvantages are obviated. This is achieved in that the talus gutter having a swallow tail shape section and remaining self fixing when arranged in a correct manner in the talus is coupled with a nonperforated end tube as a component of the construction provided with a normalised click sleeve for a tensile strength connection with the drain tube by means of a ball hinge head so that a large angular turn with respect to the talus gutter is possible and ensures in addition a firm joint with the talus gutter, so that removal afterwards is not possible without any more. The invention relates to the most frequent drain tube diameters, all of them of the same system. The construction is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a water draining ditch with draining outlets. Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken on the line A A in Fig.1 of a draining outlet embodying the invention. Fig. 3 is a detailed cross sectional view of the self fixing talus gutter embodying the invention. Fig. 4 shows the same talus gutter normal to the talus. Fig. 5 is a detailed sectional view taken on the line A A of the adaptation of the ball hinge head in the talus gutter on the conventional talus slope, Fig. 6 shows the same as Fig. 5 on a steep talus 60 . Fig. 7 illustrates the angular turn in a lateral direction. Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken on the line A A of the ball hinge head in the real size. Fig. 9 is a front view in the direction C Fig. 8 of the ball hinge head also in the real size. Fig. 1 shows a drain ditch 1, in which two drain tubes 2 are debouching. The draining grooves 3 are set at an angle 4. The set angle 4 is preferably 90 , but in dependence on the shape of the region to be drained it may be different. The slope of the talus 5 is in freshly dug ditches 1 1h, which means that the angle 6 is about 33 .In existing water courses or in special cases the angle 6 can become larger. Fig. 2 shows the complete talus protecting outlet construction in which the sleeve 7 connects the drain tube 2 with the end tube 8, said end tube flowing the drain water away the talus gutter 9. This talus gutter is held at the correct place by means of the ball hinge head 10. Fig. 3 shows the self fixing talus gutter 9 in a cross sectional view. The upright edges 11 are at an angle of about 80 inwardly whilst the bent over rims 12 provide additional rigidity. After the ground of the talus is deposited against the upright rims 11 a permanent fixation is ensured, whilst the depth of the gutter is sufficient to guard, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the ball hinge head 10 surrounding the end tube so that with respect to mowing and cleaning of the talus no hindrance occurs. Fig. 4 is a front view of the talus gutter 9, which has a circular recess 13, the section of which is slightly smaller than that of the ball of the hinge head 10. Fig. 5 is a detailed sectional view on the line A A in Fig.1 of the ball hinge head 10 fitting to the circumference of the recess 13 of the talus gutter 9 at the normal talus slope of an angle 6 of about 33 . Fig. 6 shows the same at an angle of 60 . From Figs. 5 and 6 it is apparent that for mounting purposes the talus gutter can pivotally move along the spherical surface of the ball hinge head 10, which movement may be illustrated by a tangential plane 14 drawn imagineraly through the circular recess 13 on the spherical surface 15 of an imaginary ball having the same centre of the ball hinge head 10. The limitation of a pivotal possibility is formed, inter alia by the parts 8a and 8b of the end tube 8 projecting from the ball hinge head 10. Fig. 7 shows that owing to the possibility of lateral pivoting the setting of the draining duct 3 at an angle 4 is enabled. The outlet construction need not be distorted and the talus gutter 9 can be dug in in a normal manner, whilst also owing to the trapezoidal sectional area of the talus gutter the drain water is not discharged in a talus eroding way. Fig. 8 is a sectional view on real size of the ball hinge head 10, in which the centre 16 of the ball of said ball hinge head 10 is located at a given distance 17 above the centre line 18 of the bore or end tube 8 Figs. 5 and 6 . The cylindrical part has such a height 19 that the pivotability has a limitation on all sides. The fixed connection with the end tube 8 is formed by a plurality of toothshaped lugs 20 having dimensions such that the ball hinge head 10 can be manually forced onto the end tube 8 in the direction C, but it will not recede itself. Fig. 9 is a front view of the real size in the directionC Fig. 8 , in which the bore holds the lugs 20.
