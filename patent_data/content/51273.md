# Trialkylamine sulfur dioxide catalyzed sulfenylation of carbamates.

## Abstract
An improved process is disclosed for sulfenylating carbamates in the presence of a solvent and acid acceptor, in which the reaction between a carbamate and a sulfenyl halide is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a complex of a lower alkylamine and sulfur dioxide. Several methods for preparing and utilizing the complex in the reaction are disclosed and exemplified.
