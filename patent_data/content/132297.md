# CHIP TOPOGRAPHY FOR A MOS DISK MEMORY CONTROLLER CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An improved chip topography for a disk memory con troller circuit is provided which includes electrical interface circuitry disposed around the periphery of the chip and forming an approximately quadrilateral framework sur rounding the remainder of the circuitry, a read only memory ROM disposed in one corner of the interface framework a microcontroller disposed adjacent to the ROM and along part of a first side of the interface framework read data processing circuitry disposed adjacent to the microcontrol ler and within a second corner of the interface framework and along part of a second side thereof error checking circuitry disposed adjacent to the read data processing circuitry and along part of the second side of the interface framework the microcontroller also being disposed adja cent to the error checking circuitry and along part of the second side of the interface framework write data process ing circuitry disposed adjacent to the microcontroller along the second side of the interface boundary, within a third corner of the interface framework and along a part of a third side of the interface boundary the microcontroller also being disposed adjacent to the write data processing cir cuitry and along the third side of the interface framework input output I O buffer latch circuitry disposed adjacent to the micro controller along the third side of the interface framework, which is also disposed within the fourth corner and along a part of the fourth side of the interface framework, the microcontroller also being disposed adjacent to and between the I O buffer latch circuitry and the ROM along the fourth side of the interface framework and task registers disposed between the microcontroller and the I O buffer latch circuitry.
