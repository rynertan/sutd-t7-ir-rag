# Ring opened dimethylnorbornene and isopropylnorbornene copolymers.

## Abstract
Dimethylnorbornene, isopropylnorbornene or a mixture thereof is copolymerized by ring opening with 1 at least one acyclic monoolefin or nonconjugated acyclic olefin and 2 optionally, dicyclopentadiene. The copolymers are thermoplastics which can be calendered and thermoformed, for example, to make rigid automotive goods such as glovebox covers, hubcaps and the like.
