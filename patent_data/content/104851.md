# Bi directional driver system for electrical load.

## Abstract
A bi directional driver system for an electrical load 11 operable in response to two independent logic command signals provides a means for selecting the direction of current flow in the load 11 when driven by the external command. A bridge circuit employs inputs 1,2 to dual transistor switches Q1, Q2 operating in the saturated mode in series with the electrical load 11 , cooperating with common emitter transistor linear amplifiers Q3, Q4 and diodes CR1, CR2 , and biased by the input logic signal so as to drive the load current in a predetermined direction. The circuit provides protection from undesired power supply current surges when logic command signals are applied to both inputs 1,2 , and from transients due to failure of a saturated transistor switch Q1, Q2 at one input to cease conducting before the application of a command signal to the second input. Embodiments for inductive loads and annunciator lamps are described.
