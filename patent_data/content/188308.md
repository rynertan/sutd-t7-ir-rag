# Liquid disposal mechanism.

## Abstract
The irrigator shown has a rotatable boom 1 at the ends of which are angled regions 2. The angled regions 2 are directed on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the boom 1 to cause rotation therein when effluent or water is pumped to the boom 1. The regions 2 may have rubber or the like nozzles 3 chosen so that larger pieces of effluent can be pumped therefrom. The boom 1 may be two lengths of galvanised or PVC 50mm pipe joined at the centre by a T junction 4. The boom 1 is supported by an upper part 5 of an upstand 6. The upper part 5 can rotate relative to the wheeled frame 7 on which it is supported. The part 5 has on the periphery thereof at least one cam surface 8. In the example a single cam is shown. If varying traveling speeds are required then two cams on opposite sides of the part 5 can be included to increase the number of times the cam means operates per revolution of the boom 1 or the teeth on the ratchet wheel can be changed to adjust the speed of revolution of the boom.

## Description
LIQUID DISPOSAL MECHANISM The invention relates to liquid dispersal and more particularly to an irrigator or liquid waste disposable mechanism of the type which travels under its own power. At present in certain industries there is a need to disperse relatively small quantities of liquids for example, effluent onto the ground where it degrades into the earth as a fertilizer. For example, the effluent fran meat works is often dispersed over the ground. In addition there is a need for a small scale irrigator for use in confined spaces, for example, parks, golf courses or on small farms. An object of the invention is to provide a small scale irrigator or liquid waste disposable mechanism. Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description which is given by way of example only. According to the invention there is provided a liquid disposable mechanism including a boom, a wheeled chassis, a winch drum, a ratchet wheel, a ratchet lever, a connecting rod, an upstand, a cam means, a hose connection and dispersing means, the arrangement being such that the wheeled frame supports transversely thereon the winch drum with its axis horizontal, and supports the upstand at the lower end on which is the hose connection, an upper portion of the upstand having the cam means on the periphery thereof and being rotatable relative to the wheeled frame, the tcp of the upper portion supporting the boom at either end of which is the dispensing means which are directed to throw water or effluent out on opposite sides of a longitudinal axis of the boom so that, in use, with water or effluent being fed by a flexible hose to the connection and up the upstand, along the boom and from the dispensing means which causes the boom to rotate so that the cam means on the upstand moves the ratchet lever which in turn rotates the ratchet wheel which operates the winch drum to pull in a cable to thereby pull the wheeled frame along the cable. The boom may be a length of about 50mm pipe mounted by aT junction at the top of the upstand. The boom may be about 2m to 6m in length. The wheeled frame may be generally T or V shaped in plan and constructed of box section metal tube with a palr of wheels on the ends of the transverse bar. Further aspects of the invention which should be considered in all its novel aspects will become apparent from the following examples which are given as examples only. Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 shows a perspective view from the side of an effluent irrigator according to the invention Fig. 2 shows a side elevation of a drive mechanism for the irrigator shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows a plan view of the drive mechanism shown inFig. 2 Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of part of a second erribodiment. Fig. 5 is a schematic view in perspective of a device to ensure disengagement of drive at the end of a run Fig. 6 is a schematic elevational view of a drum and wire guide according to the invention Fig. 7 is a schematic plan view, to a smaller scale thanFig. 6, of the drum and wire guide of that figure and Figure 8 is a schematic side elevational view of a back stop device. The examples will be described with reference to effluent disposal and it is to be appreciated that with minor modifications the invention can be adapted to irrigate artesian or the like water pumped to the irrigator via a flexible trailing hose. Referring to Figs. 1 3, the irrigator has a rotatable boom 1 at the ends of which are angled regions 2. The angled regions 2 are directed on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the boom 1 to cause rotation therein when water is pumped to the boom 1. The regions 2 may have rubber or the like nozzles 3 chosen so that larger pieces of effluent can be pumped therefrom.The boom 1 may be two lengths of galvanised or PVC 5 rn pipe joined at the centre by a T junction 4. The boom 1 is supported by an upper part 5 of an upstand 6. The upper part 5 can rotate relative to the wheeled frame 7 on which it is supported. The part 5 has on the periphery thereof at least one cam surface 8.In the exanple a single cam is shown. If varying travelling speeds are required then two cams on opposite sides of the part 5 can be included to increase the number of times the cam means operates per revolution of the boom 1 or the teeth on the ratchet wheel can be changed to adjust the speed of revolution of the boom. The bottom of the upstand 6 which is hollow or has a passage therethrough is connected to a water connection 9 at the rear of the wheeled frame 7. The wheeled frame 7 may be generally T or V shaped with a transverse member 10 supporting at its ends a pair of wheels 11.The longitudinal arms 12 of the frame 7 may support a front wheel not shown or a skid 13 as shown. The forward end 14 may support a tube 15 through which a cable 16 passes. One end of the cable 16 is fixed to a winch drum 17 mounted on the frame 7 while the other end is fixed to a post or spike driven into the ground at the end of the area over which the effluent is to be dispersed. The winch drum 17 is mounted with its axis transversely mounted and horizontal as shown. In the example one end flange 18 is a ratchet wheel in contact with the teeth on the periphery of which is a ratchet lever 19. me e axle 20 supporting the winch drum 17 may include a cranked handle 21 for manual winding in of the cable 16. The ratchet lever 19 is supported by a connecting rod 22 which moves arcuately. The connecting rod 22 or the end of the ratchet lever 19 has a wheel 23 which runs on the cam surface 8.The lower end 24 of the rod 22 has a biasing means 25 attached thereto. The biasing means 25 is adapted to hold the wheel 23 in contact with the cam surface 8 and the surface of the upper part 5. In use with a supply of effluent pumped via a flexible polyethylene pipe to the connection 9 it flows through the upstand and out along the boom 1 to cause rotation of the boom 1 as it exits from the nozzles 3. The rotation of the cam surface s 8 in the upstand pivots the rod 22 about 24 against the action of the biasing means and thus cause s the ratchet lever 19 to engage the ratchet wheel 18 to rotate the winch drum 17. The length of cable drawn in is varied by the number of cam surfaces 8 or by adjusting the number of teeth engaged on the ratchet wheel. The operation of the irrigator across an area is halted by a block on the line contacting the tube 15. When this occurs the member 26 is released and a cable 27 to the biasing means 25 releases the tension therein so that the wheel 23 moves away from the cam surface 8 under the bias of the spring 28. This thereby stops movement of the frame 7. Referring now the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the effluent irrigator 100 is similar to that shown in Figs. 1 3, except that the cam 101 is a double cam, and there is a means in the form of an adjustable stop 102 which determines whether connecting rod 103 allows the ratchet 104 to be retracted a greater or lesser extent, and so determines the speed of the irrigator 100 over the ground. The stop 102 carprises a rod mounted in a tube into which it can be retracted and from which it can be extended, as by being screwed when they are screw threaded. The rod has a head 105 against which rod 103 abuts. Adjustment of the rod 102 may be so that the ratchet 104 is retracted 4 teeth of the wheel 105, for fast travel, or say one 1 tooth of the wheel 105 for slow travel.The adjusting means 102 suitably provides four different forward speeds, and the clearance between the two parts of the cam 101 is half the spacing between the teeth of wheel 105 so as to provide a non jaming arrangement on rotation. In each case, the irrigator 100 has a frame similar to that shown in Figs. 1 3, and includes extending tranversely thereof and forwardly, in use, of the upstand 107, a journal in the form of a rod 108 which extends right across the frame for mounting and providing a con axis of rotation for a device 109 to ensure disengagement of the drive at the end of a run, a wire guide 110, and a back stop device 111.The device 109 corprises a counterbalance weight in the form of a plate 112 mounted on the lower in use end of rod 103 on the side of the rod or journal 108 remote from ratchet 104 by a support 113. A spring 114 equivalent to the spring 25 of the first embodiment is connected to the plate 112.The plate 112 acts at the end of a run to disengage the drive by pivoting the support 113 clockwise as viewed in Fig. 5 when the tension of spring 114 is released, so ensuring that the rod 103 and hence ratchet 104 also pivot about rod or journal 108 out of the range of the cam 101 for total disengagement. The ratchet 104 slides forwardly over the teeth of wheel 105 but out of driving engagement with them.The back stop device 111 Fig.8 is used at the start of an irrigation run to ensure that the driving gear, that is wheel 105 and ratchet 104 are properly engaged. The device 111 ccnprises a toggle lever 115 journalled for rotation on the rod or journal 108. One arm 116 of the lever 115 carprises a ratchet or pawl and the other 117, a weight. A pull rod 118 is pivoted to the pawl 116 and has a stop 120 which can be received in a slat or stirrup 121 on the upstand 107. A spring 122 is connected between the lever 115 and the upstand 107 and normally acts to urge the pawl 116 into engagement with wheel 105. In use the pull rod 118 is released normally by lifting from the seat 12, or stirrup to release stop 120 so that the spring 122 urges the pawl 116 into engagement with the teeth of the wheel 105.This provides a stop for the wheel so that the ratchet 104 is properly engaged therewith at the start of the run when paying out a cable like that 16 Fig. 1 to overcome resistance caused by grit or other obstructions in the apparatus.The wire guide 110 comprises a round section bar 123 Fig. 6 held by a frame 124 pivotally mounted on the rod or journal 108 under adjustable spring pressure 125, the end of the spring 125 remote from the bar 123 being secured by a threaded rod and nut arrangement in a part of the frame of the irrigator to provide the adjustment. The bar 123 is situated between the side flanges 105, of the drum 105 , and is spaced from each flange 105,125 by a distance less than the diameter of the wire or cable 16. The distance between the curved surface of the rod 123 and the surface of the drum 105 is just sufficient to enable the wire or cable to pass through and be wound onto or unwound from the drum 105 .The drum 105 itself has formed in its surface a thread like groove 126 each turn of which is equal to or just slightly greater in width than the diameter of the wire or cable 16. In use, like cable 16 is passed between the rod 123 and drum 105 and wound round the drum from one end. When irrigation starts and the irrigator 100 begins to move across the land being irrigated, the bar 123 guides the cable 16 evenly across the drum because it is under a greater tension from spring 125 than the tension of the wire.The wire lays itself in the thread 126 as it traverses the drum 105 when it reaches the end opposite that from which it started, it effectively has nowhere to go except back across the drum in a reverse traverse, the layer of wire already laid down effectively providing the thread . The extra thickness of wire pushes the bar 123 away against the spring 125 pressure so that the rod still acts as a guide. In this way the wire is guided to and fro across the drum as the irrigator makes its full traverse of the land being irrigated. The wire or cable is thus evenly laid up on the drum and is therefore readily wound and unwound without snagging or kinking, and therefore the irrigator operates smoothly over its run.The spring 125 is adjustable to provide for different diameters of wire or cable.The cam.101 is contoured as shown in Fig. 4 to give a firm even push, via a curved part 128, to the ratchet 104 and to provide via a flat part 129 a slow release of the ratchet over the first three teeth of wheel 105 in a four teeth driving section before the gap or concave curved part 130 which provides a clean or rapid disengagement of the ratchet as it falls away from the teeth, prior to engagement by the next curved part 128 to start the next drawing action. The cam 101 acts on the ratchet and therefore in the fast setting of the adjustable means 102, one revolution of the upstand can move eight teeth.There is also a seal of oil inpregnated nylon or similar suitable plastics material where the boom 106 rotates in the upstand 107, to provide smooth rotation, and which is inert and does not became corroded by the highly corrosive effluent. The angle of the nozzle at each end of the boom is in the range 45 30 preferably 450 to the longitudinal axis of the boom. The dispersal of effluent using a mechanism 100 according to the invention is shown in the following results of runs, on which four 4 teeth refers to the setting of the ratchet to produce a fast travel over the ground and the one 1 tooth refers to the slowest travel over the ground RUN 1 5 collecting trays each of area 2254 cm52 were set out across a 20 m width of field.
