## Description
APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR TREATING CELLS WITH RADIATIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of treating cells with radiation and specifically relates to the extracorporeal treatment OL blood cells with U.V.radiation.Background of the InventionIt is well known that a number of human disease states may be characterized by the overproduction of certain types of leukocytes, including lymphocytes, in comparison to other populations of cells which normally comprise whole blood. Excessive lymphocyte populations result in numerous adverse affects to the patients including the functional impairment of bodily organs eventually resulting in fatality.U.S. Patent No. 4,321,919 to Edelson describes a method for treating whole blood whereby such populations may be decreased. In general, the method comprises treating the whole blood with dissolved psoralen of a type capable of forming photoadducts with DNA in the presence of U.V.A.radiation in the range of about 320 to 400 nanometers.The covalent bonding that results between the psoralen and the lymphocyte nucleic acid results in lymphocyte metabolic inhibition of the thusly treated cells. These cells are then returned to the patient.Although this system promises to provide great relief to those patients in life threatening situations, numerous practical problems are yet to be solved. In particular,Edelson fails to provide for a suitable apparatus for applying, in an economical manner, the radiation to the cells.It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for the practical coupling of radiation to cells which are provided extracorporeally.It is a related object, that the present invention be simple to produce, and be capable of use by persons having a minimal level of training.Conventional techniques have relied on a plurality of devices including flasks, columns, spectrophotometer cuvettes, and petri dishes. The sample to be irradiated has been placed in these containers and the container placed adjacent to the radiation source. Such systems are limited in that often the radiation wavelengths of particular usefulness fail tQ penetrate to all of the cells contained within the container due to self blocking effects and absorption at the outer layers. Further, the systems tend to be batch limited thereby adversely affecting throughput, an important consideration in the clinical environment.It is an object of the, present invention to avoid reliance upon such devices and further, to provide a device and methods for its use which allow continuous treatment and circulation of the cells to be irradiated.In another class of devices, the sample is passed around a plurality of fibers which optically relay the radiation from radiation source. In order to be effective, however, these devices require that the fiber optics function very poorly so that the radiation is lost through the walls of the fibers thereby irradiating the cells. Further, such systems are characterized by inefficient energy coupling thereby requiring very large and expensive radiation sources.It is an object of the present invention to obviate the need for such expensive light sources by providing a comparably far more efficient source to cell energy coupling device.Summary of the Invent ionIn accordance with the objects of the present invention, there are provided devices for coupling the radiation provided from commercially available light sources such as the so called black light fluorescent tubes. In one embodiment, the fluorescent black light source, typically of tubular shape, is coaxially mounted in a tube of larger diameter, the ends of said outer tube being sealed with the radiation source. The outer tube is also provided with an inlet for receiving the cells to be irradiated and an outlet for discharging irradiated cells. In a preferred embodiment, a second outer tube of even larger diameter is coaxially mounted on the previously described device, its ends also in sealing communicating with the first outer tube. The second tube further comprises inlet and outlet means for receiving and discharging respectively cells to be irradiated.In the second embodiment, the chamber formed by the inner tube in sealing arrangement with the radiation source serves as a cooling chamber for reducing the heating effects of the bulb.In the most preferred embodiment, a plurality of the previously described tubes are arranged to form a cassette which is preferably disposable. Flow takes place serially through each of the described tubular arrangements, preferably in a serpentine manner whereby each tubular apparatus is preferably held vertically and the predominant blood flow therethrough is in a vertical fashion whereby air bubbles and the like are efficaciously flushed out.The embodiment further provides for an inlet and outlet of blood at one end of the cassette and specifically, provides for blood inlet to be ideally positioned at the bottom most portion of the first tubular apparatus. Thus, the blood outlet advantageously communicates with the top of the last most cylindrical irradiating apparatus.Thus, body cells to be treated by irradiation with the aforedescribed device are removed from the body, passed through the chamber surrounding the radiation source, and then returned to the body. Such treatment may also involve contacting the cells to be irradiated with a compound, such as those available in the psoralen class, which is activated upon radiation from the light source.Activated as used herein means that the compound has substantially no effect prior to irradiation, and following irradiation affects the treated cells in a distinguishable and detectable manner. Such a distinguishable and detectable manner may include for instance, the disruption of membrane integrity, the alteration of DNA within the cell, and the like resulting in the substantial loss of effectiveness or viability of the thusly treated cell.Brief Description of the DrawingsFurther understanding of the present invention may be had by reference to the drawing wherein FIGURE 1 graphically depicts the preferred embodiment FIGURE 2 shows an exploded view of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 depicts another embodiment having a single r chamber and FIGURE 4 depicts the most preferred embodiment of the cassette.FIGURE 5 depicts the instrument in which the Figure 4 apparatus is used.Detailed Description of the Drawings and Best ModeAlthough a number of U.V. activated compounds in the psoralen class are known, 8 methoxy psoralen is the compound of choice. An effective radiation for this compound, and many psoralens in general, is the ultraviolet spectrum in the range of approximately 320 to 400 nanometers. A light source which provides such a spectrum U.V.A. is the Sylvania F8TS BLB 8W Black tightT5 Blue Bulb. Substantial equivalents are also available from other manufacturers such as General Electric. These bulbs traditionally come in the small fluoreScent1 type tube arrangement for which suitable electrical sockets and power supplies are readily available. With reference to FIG. 1, such a light source 10 is shown with tubes 11 and 13 coaxially mounted thereon. With additional reference to FIG. 2, it may be readily appreciated that the inner tube 11, is preferably provided with spacer rings 16 mounted on the end thereof in order to maintain coaxial alignment with tube 10. Permanent sealing connection may be made by application of a suitable sealing or cementing material such as the class of epoxy adhesives or solvents such as methylene chloride, particulary useful for welding various classes of plastics together. The inner tube is provided with orifices 12 permitting the free flow of convection currents through the chamber thereby cooling the light source 10.Depending on the ambient conditions in which the device is operated, one may find it desirable to increase air flow through the chamber by any suitable means such as forced air and the like.In the most preferred embodiment, inner tube 11 is made from a substantially U.V. transparent material such as acrylic, cellulose triacetate or a suitable rigid PVC Based on cost and availability, as well as U.V. tranparency, acrylic tends to be the most preferred material and accordingly, is ideally employed in the best embodiment.With further reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, an outer tube 13 is coaxially mounted onto the inner tube 11 advantageously by means of spacers 15. The mounting with the spacers 15 is accomplished in a sealing fashion typically by the application of a suitable solvent for chemically welding the outer tube 13, the spacer 15, and the inner tube 11 together. Outer tube 13 has further mounted thereon inlet and outlet 14 for receiving and discharging respectively the fluid sample to be irradiated. In a preferred embodiment, these inlets 14 are Luer type connectors.It may be further noted that spacers 15 have a protruding finger type projection which is preferably disposed on the opposite wall from the inlet 14 and outlet 14. Such a projection advantageously reduces stagnant fluid volumes which would otherwise accumulate in that location. Clearly, such a projection may take the form of virtually any shape and, if desired, may be eliminated all together.FIG. 3 depicts another embodiment of the instant invention wherein a single chamber is used formed by the tube 11 in coaxial orientation with bulb 10 with the ends thereof sealed with a suitable material such as epoxy 17.Suitable in this case would be defined as a material capable of sealingly adhering to the glass of light source 10 and the material 11, and having no substantive interactions with the sample containing cells to be irradiated. Tube 11 is outfittedfwith inlet and outlets 14 for receiving and discharging the fluid sample. Orientation of flow within the chamber is snot important and may be in either direction, however, if a plurality of devices of either the type shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 3 are employed such as shown in FIG. 4, they are preferably aligned in a vertical fashion and flow is arranged to proceed from bottom to top. Even if a single device is employed, this is the preferred flow arrangement for eliminating air bubbles which might otherwise become trapped in an alternative arrangement.FIG. 4 shows the most preferred embodiment referred to herein as a cassette. The cassette employs a plurality of irradiating chambers 20 each of which is substantially similar in structure to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.The ideal arrangement has six such irradiating chambers 20, however, more or less such chambers may be employed, subject only to the constraints of practical construction and ease of handling. It will be readily understood, of course, that increasing the number of irradiation tubes and forcing the blood to flow through each of them, accordingly increases the amount of irradiation to the fluid flowing therethrough.In the cassette shown in FIG. 4, blood is communicated to the irradiating chamber 20 through inlet 21 which may be either a Luer lock or simply an inlet pipe to which a tubing set may be attached by any suitable means such as solvent welding and the like. The fluid to be irradiated then flows in a generally upward direction and then downwardly through cross connecting means 22 which may comprise a flexible or inflexible tubing connecting chamber outlet 23 to chamber inlet 24 of the next irradiation chamber. This process produces a serpentine flow in the direction indicated by the arrows which has been found to be more effective in evacuating air bubbles and the like. Clearly, the reverse directions may be also employed, as the flow of the fluid through the irradiation chamber 20, is equally effected by the illumination from lamps 25 irregardless of flow.Finally, the fluid reaches outlet 23 of the last irradiation chamber 20 and is emitted from the cassette through the cassette outlet 27.In FIG. 4, this outlet is shown to be at the same side as the cassette inlet 21 via outlet connecting tubing 28.This arrangement facilitates connection and handling as all such connections are made from one end of the cassette. Alternately, the cassette outlet 27 may be in a form similar to cassette inlet 21 directly at the last chamber outlet 23. Each irradiation chamber 20 has tabs 29 holding the irradiation lamp 25 in place within the irradiation chamber. The openings between tabs in combination with inner wall 26 allow the formation of an air space surrounding the lamp 25 which freely communicates with the atmosphere thereby providing cooling in much the same manner as obtained from the interior cooling chamber formed by tube 11 in FIG. 2.It will be readily understood that although individual cross connecting tubing means 22 are shown in FIG. 4, suitable molding processes may be used whereby such means become an inherent portion of the cassette itself. Such an arrangement would be advantageous from the point of view that fewer connections would have to be made in such instance thereby reducing the opportunity for inadvertent leakages.FIGURE 5 depicts the preferred embodiment of the blood treatment center 30 which employs the cassette of Figure 4 in sliding drawer 37. The flow of heparin or other clot preventing solution through pump 31 via a tubing set not shown and the flow of blood through pump 32 from centifuge 33 is controlled by clamps 36A, B and C in turn controlled by control panel 39. The centrifuge 33 is a continuous flow type whereby the operator, by viewing through port 34, determines when a leukocyte rich portion of whole blood is obtained. All solutions are collected in bags not shown which hang beside internal access panels 38. After treatment, treated and nontreated blood portions are hung on drip stand 35 and reinfused into the patient.Example 1A device as that depicted in FIG. 3, having ends sealed with a combination 0 ring and epoxy material was employed with a Sylvania F8TS BLB Lamp. A simple recirculating system was constructed comprising a flexible bag for holding the blood and communicating with inlet located at the bottom of the vertically arranged device. The blood was permitted to flow around the lamp, up through the chamber out the exit orifice whereupon it was returned to the bag. Connections were by means of a flexible tube Tygon tubing which was run through a roller bearing type pump. Circuit volume was 150 ml of diluted fresh human blood containing 62 ng ml of 8 methoxy psoralen. The erythrocyte concentration was 6.7 x 108 per ml and the leukocyte concentration was 1.4 x 106 per ml. The priming volume of the device was 25 ml with a blood film thickness of 0.070 inches i.e., the distance between the bulb and the inner surface of the surrounding jacket or tube was 0.07 inches. Blood flow rate was maintained at 50 ml per minute. A pretreatment sample was taken prior to anyU.V. exposure and then one sample was run through a circuit such as that described having one device therein and the sample irradiated with 63 joules per ml. An identical system was set up except that 3 tubes in series were employed flow through each tube being from bottom to top such that 190 joules per ml of irradiation was delivered. The leukocytes were observed for viability over a 4 day period. Viability was determined by treatment with trypsan blue dye and microscopic examination in a manner well known by those skilled.The results obtained are presented below in Table 1.

Example 2Three devices similar to that shown in FIG. 1 were arranged vertically and connected in serial fashion.Connections were made from the output to a Fenwall 350 cc transfer pack with the inlet thereof running through a blood pump and into the first device s inlet. The blood pump maintained flow at 50 ml per minute. The radiation source was a Sylvania F8T5 BLB lamp. Surrounding the lamp was an inner, U.V. transparent tube having a 7 8 outer diameter. The outer polycarbonate tubing had a 1 outer diameter. The test circuit was primed for 20 minutes with phosphate buffered saline PBS and then drained. The sterilized circuitry containing three devices shown inFIG. 1 was primed with 175 cc of leukophoresced blood from a patient who had orally ingested 8 methoxy psoralen two hours prior to being leukophoresced. The cellular concentrations on this phoresced blood sample were 2.8 x 108 rbc ml and 3.8 x 106 wbc ml. The blood was permitted to circulate through the system for 20 minutes at 50 ml per minute without the lamps being turned on. A pretreatment sample To was taken. The lamps were turned on and the blood circulated for 1 hour and 25 minutes at which time sample T1 was taken.Thereafter, the transfer pack was removed from the circuit the venous and arterial lines were connected together and the blood solution allowed to circulate for another 1 hour 20 minutes at which time sample T2 was obtained.The effective surface area per cell was calculated to be 163 cm2, the effective length 23.5 cm, the priming volume per cell 28 ml, the blood film thickness approximately 1.6 millimeters and the average power per cell 5.5 milliwatts per cm2. Sample T1 represented cells irradiated with 94 joules per ml and T2 represented cells irradiated with 190 joules per ml.Viability of the cells was observed from Day 0 to Day 4.The cells were maintained in vitro by addition of growth medium at a 1 1 proportion of cells to growth medium.Growth medium contained foetal calf serum 30 and 70 RPMI, a well known tissue culture media. Results obtained are presented in Table 2 below.

It will become readily apparent to those skilled that the thickness of the chamber containing the fluid sample, the flow rate of the sample therethrough, lamp power output and cellular concentrations will be advantageously designed in order to afford the desired application of energy to the fluid sample in order to obtain the effects required. Accordingly, the present invention also contemplates the use of any type of radiation source and is not to be limited to the broad band U.V. spectrum employed in the examples.
