# Method of producing a preform wire, sheet or tape for fibre reinforced metals, and an ultrasonic wave vibration apparatus.

## Abstract
A preform wire for FRM consisting of a metal silicon car bide fiber composite material is light in weight and excellent in strength and elasticity, and can be easily obtained by im pregnating a silicon carbide fiber bundle 2 with a molten metal which is kept vibrated by means of an ultrasonic wave vibration apparatus 9 having a cooling means.
