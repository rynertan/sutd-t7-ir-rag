# GRIPPING UNIT

## Abstract
A gripping unit 1 intended by means of mechanical contact to be caused to interact with an object 2 for the purpose of maintaining a gripping surface 3 belonging to the gripping unit in a fixed position relative to the object, said gripping unit including on the one hand a number of gripping elements 4 and on the other hand a gripping element support 5 connected to the gripping elements, in which the surface 3 of the gripping unit facing the object is in the form of one or more hard, gripping elements 4 . Each gripping element 4 is joined directly to the gripping element support 5 by a metallurgical atomic bond. The material used for the gripping element support 5 is selected so as to exhibit considerable elastic rigidity, having the same or essentially the same modulus of elasticity as the material used for the gripping element 5 .
