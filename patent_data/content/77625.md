# Controlled rectifier bridge converter.

## Abstract
A rectifier system in which the harmonic content of the A.C. current is reduced in a particularly efficient manner. Two or more 3 phase thyristor bridges are connected in parallel to the A.C. supply, and to the DC output by way of interphase transformers. For the positive thyristors, and for the negative thyristors separately, the conduction transitions within each bridge are staggered from one bridge to the next so that the total conduction on each phase follows a stepped character istic approaching a sine wave and thus having a smaller harmonic content than a comparable arrangement having uniform firing angles from bridge to bridge.
