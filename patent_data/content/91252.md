# Two step catalytic hydrodewaxing hydrodesulfurization process.

## Abstract
A high pour point, high sulfur content gas oil is processed in a combination process wherein the gas oil is first catalytically dewaxed and then hydrodesulfurized in a cascade system which enables the two operations to be integrated through a common hydrogen system and where by substantial quantities of thermal energy are recovered for reuse resulting in significant energy conservation.
