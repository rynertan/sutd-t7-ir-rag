# Production of low cholesterol casein.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of precipitating casein from skim milk, which casein has a significantly reduced cho lesterol content. The method involves maintaining the pH of the milk at a value of from about 6.0 to about 6.9 while treating it with pancreatic lipase for a time sufficient to dis sociate the casein from cholesterol contained therein and coagulating the casein by enzymatic means.
