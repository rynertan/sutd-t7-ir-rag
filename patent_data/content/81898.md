# AN ADJUSTMENT MEANS

## Abstract
A housing 20 is fixed on an adjustable member 18 and supports the same for sliding movement on a portion of a support member 15 . Notches 44 are spaced vertically along the upper portion of the support member and a pawl 32 is pivotally supported on the housing and includes a ratchet finger 35 movable between an operative position with the ratchet finger in engagement with the notches and an inoperative position with the ratchet finger out of engagement with the notches. A spring 40 is associated with the pawl and is operable to selectively maintain the ratchet finger in either the operative or inoperative positions. When the adjustable member is moved in a first direction to one end of its adjustment limit, the pawl is switched to the inoperative position and the adjustable member may be freely moved to the other end of the adjustment limit in preparation for a subsequent adjustment in the first direction.
