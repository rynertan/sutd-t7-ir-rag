# Trace vapour detector.

## Abstract
A detector for trace quantities of chemical species in the atmosphere includes a pump 7 for drawing an atmospheric sample through transfer means 1 which transfer species molecules present in the sample to a dry carrier gas circulating in a closed gas flow circuit including the transfer means 1, an ion mobility type detector 12, filters 16 and 26 and a circulating pump 20 the filters remove water molecules and species molecules from the carrier gas. The carrier gas may be air. The arrangement inhibits water vapour reaching the detector 12 and reducing its sensitivity to the chemical species.
