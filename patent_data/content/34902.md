# WELDING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
This relates to a method and apparatus for welding thin walled sheet steel tubular members of the type primarily intended for use as container bodies. The sheet steel may be provided with a suitable coating, such as tin plating, and is preferably heated by induction heating. The heated edge por tions of a rounded tubular member are initially pressed together to effect bonding or welding, after which they are engaged by forge rolls to reduce the thickness of the resultant seam. The pressing together of the edge portions to initiate bonding is preferably effected between two coated surfaces, such as ceramic, with the pressure being applied by one of the members in the form of a spring loaded pin. When the electri cal energy is induced into the edge portions, there is provided a secondary coil having a bore therethrough through which the rounded tubular member passes with the coil serving to size and guide the tubular member. The coil has associated therewith a core structure for effecting the concentration of the electrical current in the overlapped edge portions.
