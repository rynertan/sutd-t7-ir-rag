# TAPER MACHINING CONTROLLING METHOD AND CONTROL SYSTEM FOR WIRE CUT DISCHARGE MACHINING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A taper machining controlling method and system for a wire cut discharge machining apparatus for machining the taper due to an electric discharge at a work WK by moving the work WK relative to a wire WR and applying a voltage between the work WK and the wire WR . When a relative movement instruction for the work WK and the wire WR and a movement instruction for an upper guide UG of the wire WR are applied from a machining instruction, an interpolated distance between the upper guide UG and the lower guide DG of the wire WR and the interpolated distance at the predetermined plane of the work WK are calculated from the machining instruction. Then, the moving speed of the upper and the lower guides UG and DG are obtained to move the wire WR relative to the work WK at the instructed speed and to simultaneously start and finish the movements of the upper and the lower guides UG and DG with the interpolated distance and the instructed speed, thereby moving both guides UG and DG .
