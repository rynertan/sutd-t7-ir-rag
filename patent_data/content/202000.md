# Aromatisation of paraffins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for converting a C₂ C₆ paraffin feedstock to aromatics over a gallium loaded xeolite catalyst. The feature of the invention is to bring the ethane in the feed with a fresh or freshly regenerated catalyst first and thereafter to bring the residual catalyst from this step into contact with the remainder of the C₃ C₆ feedstock. The present process has the advantage of maximising the yields of aromatics from a mixed feedstock using a single reactor and a single charge of catalyst.
