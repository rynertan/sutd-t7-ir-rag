# Melamine group containing acrylates and or methacrylates, polymerizable and curable composition thereof, molded article made of the polymerized and cured composition and resin molded article coated with the composition.

## Abstract
The invention involves a novel melamine group containing meth acrylate, e.g. hexakis 2 acryloyloxypropyl melamine, hexakis 2 acryloyloxyethyl melamine, etc., and its polymer. Said meth acrylate has excellent reactivity and storage stability, and said polymer has excellent dimensional stability, durabilities especially water resistance and moisture resistance and sur face hardness, and is useful as a molded product and a coating layer of a molded resin article. For example, a polyester film coated with said polymer has excellent adhesivity, flexibility and dimensional stability as well as high abrasion resistance, and can be used to a wide variety of uses as an abrasion resistant film.
