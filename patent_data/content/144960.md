The same compound can also be described by the name N,N 1,10 decanediyldi 1 4H pyridyl 4 ylidene bis 1 octaneamine dihydrochloride, whose hypothetical free base form has been given the generic name octenidine. In oral use the bis 4 substituted amino 1 pyridinium alkane salts subgenerically and specifically described by U.S. Pat. 4,206,215, for example, the dihydrochloride salt of octenidine, have an extremely bitter taste and a lingering bitter metallic aftertaste. Attempts have been made to formulÅate antiplaque TM dentifrices and one such product is CORSODYL Dental GEL containing 1 by weight of chlorhexidine gluconate manufactured by Imperial Chemical Industries Limited,Pharmaceuticals Division, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England , but these attempts including CORSODYL Dental Gel have been generally unsuccessful due to the problem of comç bining antiplaque activity, good taste, good foaming ability and good polishing ability in a single formulation.The presently described and claimed invention overcomes this problem and provides such a formulation. In one aspect the invention deals with an antiplaque dentifrice comprisingA an effective dental plaque inhibiting, reducing or preventing amount of the saccharin salt of an amino or quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agent which is a a compound having the structural formulaEMI3.1 Formula I wherein R taken alone is phenyl substituted by alkyl, alkoxy, nitro or halo, p 2,2 dichlorocyclopropyl phenyl, alkyl having from 6 to 16 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl or polycyclic alkyl having 5 or more carbon atoms or lower alkyl cycloalkyl or cycloalkyl lower alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in lower alkyl R taken alone is hydrogen R and R taken together are 3 azabicyclo 3,2,2 nonyl and n is an integer from 3 to 9 b a compound having the structural formulaEMI3.2 Formula II or EMI4.1 Formula III wherein R1 is long chain alkyl or aralkyl R2 is short chain alkyl, long chain alkyl or aralkyl, benzyl or part of an aromatic system or non aromatic system R3 and R4 are shortchain alkyl or part of an aromatic ring system or non aromatic ring system and Z is a carbonhydrogen chain or c a compound having the structural formulaEMI4.2 Formula IV wherein Y is alkylene containing from 4 to 18 carbon atoms and separating the two 4 R amino l pyridinium groups by from 4 to 18 carbon atoms R is the same in both occurrences and is alkyl containing from 6 to 18 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl containing from 5 to 7 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenyl substituted by methylenedioxy or one or two substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, nitro, cyano and trifluoromethyl andR1 is the same in both occurrences and is hydrogen or lower alkyl B a polishing agent or thickening agent which is silicon dioxide, silicic acid, silica, amorphous silica, precipitated silica, hydrated silica, silica hydrate, silica gel, silica xerogel or hydrous silica gel andC a foaming agent which is N alkanoylsarcosine orN alkenoylsarcosine or an alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salt thereof, wherein alkanoyl or alkenoyl has from 8 to 18 carbon atoms or alkanolamine has from 2 to 9 carbon atoms. The compounds of Formula IV as defined above are novel and represent a further aspect of the invention. The compounds of Formula IV can also be described as N,N alkanediyldi 1 4H pyridin 4 ylidene bis l R amino disaccharin salts having the structural formulaEMI5.1 Formula V wherein Y, Rand R1 have the same meanings set forth above for Formula IV. The compounds of Formula IV or V are useful as antimicrobial agents and are particularly useful as agents for inhibiting, reducing and preventing dental plaque in dentifrices. One can inhibit, reduce or prevent dental plaque by contacting the dental plaque itself or the natural or artificial teeth or oral cavity of a living person with an effective dental plaque inhibiting, reducing or preventing amount of the above described antiplaque dentifrice. The non saccharin salts corresponding to the compounds of Forrmlas I IV are generally and particularly described by the above cited prior art, which in some instances also describes the saccharin salts. Those saccharin salts of Formulas I IV which are not described by the prior art are prepared by reacting in an aqueous solvent a corresponding relatively soluble non saccharin salt with saccharin or a soluble salt of saccharin and separating the relatively insoluble saccharin salt. The novel compounds of Formula IV can be prepared by reacting in an aqueous solvent a corresponding relatively soluble bis 4 R amino L pyridinium alkane non saccharin salt with saccharin or a soluble salt of saccharin and separating the relatively insoluble bis 4 R amino l pyridiniumi alkane disaccharin salt. The aqueous solvent can be water alone, which is the preferred solvent, or a mixture of water and one or more water miscible organic solvents selected from the alcohols, ketones, acids, amides, nitriles and sulfoxides and multifunctional and mixed functional solvents. Since sax arin is only slightly soluble in water, a soluble salt, for e ple, an alkali metal salt, is preferably used. SaoSrin sodium salt is most preferred. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperah e in the range of 0 1000C., most preferably 20 600C. A preferred saccharin salt of Formulas I IV is the compound of Formula I wherein R is p chlorophenyl, R is hydrogen and n is 6, which is the saccharin salt of chlorhexidine and is described by the above citedChemical Abstracts abstract of Japanese Patent 4891.Another preferred saccharin salt of Formulas I IV is the compound of Formula IV wherein R is octyl, R1 is hydrogen and Y is 1,10 decylene, which is the saccharin salt of octenidine and is prepared from molar equivalent quantities of octenidine dihydrochloride salt and saccharin sodium salt in water m.p. 820C. . The effective dental plaque inhibiting, reducing or preventing amount of the saccharin salt of FormulasI IV is generally in the range of 0.1 108 and most generally of the order of 1 by weight of the dentifrice. Silicic acid, silica, amorphous silica, precipitated silica, hydrated silica, silica hydrate, silica gel, silica xerogel and hydrous silica gel are all forms of silicon dioxide SiO2 differing in the method of formation and extent of hydration. Of these hydrous silica gel hydrated silica is most preferred. Different grades of hydrated silica are available for polishing and thickening.The dentifrices of the invention preferably contain both a polishing grade and a thickening grade of hydrated silica.The amount of polishing agent and thickening agent is generally in the range of 5 508 by weight of the dentifrice. In N alkanoylsarcosine and N alkenoylsarcosine alkanoyl and alkenoyl having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms can be branched or unbranched. Unbranched alkanoyl having an even number of carbon atoms is preferred, especially lauroyl having 12 carbon atoms. Preferred alkanolamine salts include the monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine salts. The alkali metal salts include the lithium, sodium, and potassium salts. Sodium salts are preferred. The most preferred foaming agent is sodium N lauroyl sarcosinate.The amount of foaming agent is generally in the range of 0.1 10 and most generally of the order of 1 by weight of the dentifrice. In addition to the above described components the dentifrices of the invention generally also contain one or more humectants, for example, sorbitol, glycerin or a polyethylene glycol, for example, PEG 6 32, which is an adopted name for a mixture of the polyethylene glycol having 6 ethylene oxide units and the polyethylene glycol having 32 ethylene glycol units caries reducing, inhibiting or preventing fluoride salts, for example, sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate or stannous fluoride sweeteners, for example, free saccharin in addition to the bound saccharin of the above described saccharin salts, cyclamate or aspartame flavors colorants acids or bases to adjust the pH desirably about 7 , for example, hydro chloric acid or sodium hydroxide and water. The following is an example of the preparation of a novel compound of Formula IV. EXAMPLE I A warm 500C. solution of N,N 1,10 decanediyldi 1 4H pyridin 4 ylidene bis l octanamine octenidine dihydrochloride salt 623 g., 1.00 mole in deionized water 6 1. was added with stirring during 15 minutes to a warm 500C. solution of saccharin sodium salt 520 g., 2.00 mole in deionized water 2 1. . Stirring was continued for two hours, then the mixture was filtered.The solid was washed with hot deionized water 3 1. and dried at 600C. under vacuum, affording N,N 1,10 decanediyldi l 4H pyridin 4 ylidene bis 1 octanamine octenidine disaccharin saccharin salt molecular weight 917.1, 890 g., 97 yield, m.r. 82 85 C. . In preparing the dentifrices of the invention the saccharin salts of Formulas I IV can be formed in situ, but use of preformed saccharin salt is preferred.To ensure maximum possible antiplaque effect the preformed saccharin salt is added as the last ingredient of the dentifrice formulation. A typical order of addition of the remaining ingredients of a typical formulation is water, fluoride salt, humectants, sweetener, foaming agent, flavors, colorant, acid or base to adjust pH, and polishing and thickening agents. Accordingly the following examples were prepared.

Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10558 and Actinomyces viscosus M 100 were used as plaque forming microorganisms and were stored prior to use in a frozen or lyophilized state. Working stock cultures were maintained by twice monthly passage in fluid thioglycollate medium containing 20 w v meat extract and excess calcium carbonate. For plaque formation the medium of Jordan et al. J. Dent. Res., vol. 39, pp. 116 123, 1960 supplemented with 5 w v sucrose was used. All cultures were adapted to this growth medium by at least one growth cycle prior to use in the tests. The substrates were cleaned, sterilized ceramic hydroxylapatite durapatite slabs approximately 1 4 x 1 2 x 2 in size, which were manipulated during transfer and brushing with sterile clamps hemostats . Brushing was done with a wetted medium bristle toothbrush and one inch strips of the dentifrice on all sides of the slab for one minute. The slab was then rinsed in running tap water for one minute with manipulation to ensure removal of all visible dentifrice Plaques were developed on the slabs by daily passage through the supplemented Jordan et al. medium 20 ml. in culture tubes. Only the initial culture tube was inoculated with the plaque forming microorganism at least 0.3 ml. of a late log phase culture . Subsequent tubes were not directly inoculated.Thus, only the most adherent microorganisms were carried over, thereby permitting formation of strongly adherent plaques. After three successive daily transfers the slabs were brushed with the dentifrice, rinsed and immersed in fresh growth medium containing a pH indicator bromocresol purple .The culture tubes were incubated for 24 hours at 370C.under an anaerobic atmosphere. A once daily brushing regimen was thus simulated. Alternatively the slabs were brushed twice daily and the incubation periods were 6 and 16 hours in duration. Growth and metabolic activity acid production were subsequently assessed, and the treatment and incubation s were repeated. The slabs were brushed daily until the cultures failed to yield acid end products and ideally yielded viable bacteria. Metabolic activity M.A. was measured 12 and 36 hours after final treatment and scored acid production and turbidity increase , no acid shift but noticeable turbidity increase or no acid shift and minimal evidence of turbidity increase . Plaque was measured following staining with erythrosin and scored 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or F1 flecks or microcolonies . The following results were obtained from duplicate brushings twice daily for three successive days with only water and no dentifrice, a placebo dentifrice the composition ofExample 2 and 3 wherein the antimicrobial agent was replaced by an equal amount of sorbitol solution and the compositions of Example 2 and 3.

Although CORSODYL Dental Gel showed good antiplaque activity against preformed S. mutans plaque on durapatite slabs in vitro after one brushing per day on three successive days, it does not have the other three attributes in good measure when compared with the dentifrice of Example 2. Comparison of the taste of the dentifrice ofExample 2 with that of CORSODYL Dental Gel showed that CORSODYLTM Dental Gel had a bitter taste whereas the dentifrice of Example 2 did not have a bitter taste. The following test was carried out to compare the foaming ability of the dentifrice of Example 2 with that of CORSODYLTM Dental Gel. Each of the test formulations 0.5 g. was placed in a 50 ml. graduate cylinder together with human salvia which had been passed through a 100 mesh screen 10 ml. and a toothbrush whose handle had been cut off so that it would fit into the cylinder Abco reazers w Inc. 350100 cut to a length of 1 1 2 inches . More saliva was added to make the total volume 20 ml. The cylinder was securely stoppered and rotated end over end at a constant rate of about 34 revolutions per minute.Foam volumes were read after 25, 50, 75 and 100 revolutions.Seven cylinders were used and mean foam volumes and standard errors were calculated for each formulation. The following results were obtained. Mean Foam Volume ml. Number of CORSODYL Dentifrice ofRevolutions Dental Gel Example 2 25 20 0.2 22 0.3 50 21 0 24 0.3 75 22 0.2 25 0.3 100 22 0 26 0.3 overall Mean 21 0.1 24 0.3The mean foam volume values for the dentifrice of Example 2 T are significantly greater than those of CORSODYL M Dental Gel p 0.05 . Due to the presence of the polishing agent the dentifrices of the invention have good polishing ability. CORSODYLTM Dental Gel, on the other hand, appears to contain little or no polishing agent and thus to have little or no polishing ability. This is shown by the fact that CORSODYLTM Dental Gel has a very small residue after combustion 0.05 , 0.06 in two determinations compared with the dentifrices of Example 2 19.9 and Example 3 19.3 Antimicrobial Properties of the Compounds of Formulas IV and V The utility of the compounds of Formula IV or V as antimicrobial agents has been shown by determining the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of a sample of the compound of Example 1 prepared as described above using distilled water instead of deionized water and without heating m.r. 71.5 730C. . A solution of the compound in propylene glycol 6.4 pM. ml. was prepared and tested against one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes representing the gram positive bacteria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomcnas aeruginosa representing the gram negative bacteria, and Aspergillis niger, Candida albicans andTrichophyton mentagrophytes representing the fungi. The cultures of S. aureus, the five gram negative strains andC. albicans were grown in tryptose phosphate broth.S. pyogenes was grown in brain heart infusion broth with 10 normal horse serum. These eight cultures were adjusted to an optical density of 0.10 650 nm., B Spectronic 20 , then diluted in double strength culture medium to 2x105 cells ml. A. niger and T. mentagrophytes were maintained as spore suspensions and diluted in double strength maltose peptone num 3 broth to 2x105 spores ml. as determined previously by plate count. Serial twofold dilutions of the propylene glycol solution of the test compound were prepared in sterile distilled water in test tubes. Each dilution was inoculated with an equal volume of each of the diluted microbial cultures and incubated, the bacteria for 18 20 hours at 370C. and the fungi for five days at 25BC. The lowest concentration of the test compound which prevented visible growth of the microorganism is the minimum inhibitory concentration, whose values are shown in the following table.
