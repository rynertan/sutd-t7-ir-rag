# METHOD OF OPERATION OF A FUEL CELL

## Abstract
Present invention relates to a method of operation of a fuel cell, in which method the fuel cell is operated so that a stoechiometric excess amount of fuel is present at the anode relative to the amount of oxidant in the cathode chamber s , in which method the anode is connected with the cathode within the fuel cell through one or more electrical conduc tors, the arithmetic product of the total electrical resistance between the anode and the cathode electrically conductive connected therewith within the fuel cell in Ω and the active area of the cathode in m² lying between 10 ⁴ and 10 Ωm², and in which method subsequently the external current drain is stopped and also the oxidant supply at least virtually is stopped, one or more electrically conductive connections being maintained between the anode and the cathode within the fuel cell after the external current drain from this fuel cell having been stopped and also the anode chamber s being left filled with fuel.
