# Compositie polyolefin based containers having improved gas barrier properties.

## Abstract
A polyolefin container having improved gas barrier properties is fabricated from particles of a solid material having low permeability to gases, the solid material being coated with an olefin polymer by polymerizing an olefin monomer in the presence of the solid material.
