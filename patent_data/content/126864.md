# Thin film magnetic transducer head and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A film transducer head is formed on a substrate 10 where the first yoke layer 13, 15 and electric terminal strip 19 that connects the coil center pad to the head exterior are formed at the same time followed by successive layers that form the transducer gap 16 , coil insulation 23 , coil 22 , coil insulation 24 and the second yoke layer 14 . This sequence allows the coil to be tested immediately after deposition of the coil material and at a time in the fabrication sequence when it can be reworked or replaced if a discon tinuity open or shorted turn s is are identified.
