## Description
ROTARY FORMING TOOL AND SPINDLE THEREFOR TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a rotary forming tool and spindle therefor for forming workpieces with splines, teeth, or threads, etc. during use. BACKGROUND ART The United States Patent of Anderson 4,045,988, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, discloses a rotary forming machine including a pair of spaced rotatable tool spindles each of which supports three rotary forming tools. Upon coordinated rotational driving of the spindles, opposite sides of a round workpiece located therebetween are engaged by partially circular forming faces of an associated pair of the tools on the two spindles to provide forming of the workpiece. Each tool has an elongated shape between leading and trailing ends of the partially circular forming face thereof on which forming projections are provided to form the workpiece. A flat base mounting surface of each tool extends between the leading and trailing ends thereof and is mounted on a flat base mounting surface of the associated spindle. With such a three tool spindle construction, the diameter of the workpiece which can be formed for any given radius of the tool forming faces is limited by the maximum 120 degree angle available for each tool while also allowing some circumferential space between the tools sudh that workpieces can be loaded and unloaded between the forming operation performed by each associated pair of the tools. United States Patents 713,219 1,017,400 and 1,357141 each disclose rotary spindles on which tools or molds having flat base surfaces are mounted with partially circular forming faces extending between the ends of the tools and facing outwardly with respect to the associated spindle. United States Patents 186,905 and 524,547 each disclose a rotary machine including tools having partially circular mounting surfaces mounted on conjugate mounting surfaces of associated spindles for use. Each tool also has an outwardly oriented forming face of a partially circular shape. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Objects of the present invention are to provide an improved rotary forming tool and an improved tool spindle having a tool holder for mounting a pair of the rotary tools. A rotary forming tool constructed in accordance with the present invention comprises a tool body of a generally C shape and having a rotational axis about which the tool is adapted to rotate in a mounted relationship on an associated tool spindle. The tool body has a partially circular forming face extending about the rotational axis for an angle less than 180 degrees facing outwardly with respect to the axis and also has leading and trailing ends between which the forming face extends. Fcrming projections are positioned along the forming face between the ends of the tool body to provide forming of a workpiece. The leading and trailing ends of the tool body include flat end support surfaces that are coplanar with each other to provide mounting of the tool on the spindle. An inner side of the tool body has a concave shape facing inwardly toward the rotational axis of the tool.A flat intermediate support surface on the inner side of the tool body extends parallel to the coplanar end support surfaces and cooperates therewith to provide mounting of the tool body on an associated spindle. Forming projections of the tool are disclosed as forming teeth for pressure forming teeth or splines in a workpiece or for burnishing splines or teeth on a preformed workpiece. Also, the forming projections can be in the form of threads for threading a workpiece. Both the leading and trailing ends of the tool body also include locating surfaces that oppose each other in a parallel relationship. Each locating surface has a right angle junction with the adjacent end support surface. A pair of curved connecting surfaces on the inner side of the tool body respectively extend between the intermediate support surface and the locating surfaces and have concave shapes facing inwardly toward the rotational axis. Side walls of the tool body extend between the forming face and the inner side thereof in a parallel relationship to each other and in a perpendicular relationship to both the end and intermediate support surfaces. A rotary tool spindle constructed in accordance with the invention is adaptable to mount a pair of the rotary tools and is used in cooperation with another like spindle in a spaced relationship to each other. A workpiece positioned between the spindles is formed upon coordinated rotational driving thereof as the forming projections on one tool of each spindle engage the workpiece at the opposite side thereof as the tool on the other spindle. The rotary tool spindle comprises a tool holder having a rotational axis and a symmetrical shape about a central plane thereof through the rotational axis.A pair of tool mounts of the holder are respectively located on opposite sides of the central plane to provide mounting of a pair of the rotary tools on the spindle. Each mount includes a pair of flat end mounting surfaces that are coplanar with each other extending parallel to the central plane of the spindle on opposite sides of a perpendicular to the central plane through the rotational axis. Each tool mount also includes a flat intermediate mounting surface located between the associated end mounting surfaces radially outward therefrom extending parallel thereto and to the central plane of the spindle. Upon mounting of each rotary tool on the spindle, the end support surfaces of the tool body respectively engage the associated end mounting surfaces of the tool holder and the intermediate support surface of the tool body engages the associated intermediate mounting sur face of the tool holder so as to cooperate with the end support and mounting surfaces in mounting the tool. Each tool mount of the spindle holder includes a pair of locating surfaces that face away from each other respectively adjacent the associated end mounting surfaces. Engagement of the locating surfaces on the tool holder with the locating surfaces on the tool body at the ends thereof locates the tool with its forming face concentric with the rotational axis of the spindle. Each locating surface on the spindle is preferably flat and has a right angle junction with the adjacent end mounting surface in a conjugate relationship to the locating and end support surfaces of the associated tool body. Each tooi mount of the spindle holder includes a pair of flanges respectively defining its end mounting surfaces. The flanges of each tool mount are spaced from the flanges of the other tool mount on the spindle on opposite sides of the central plane about which the spindle is symmetrical. Each tool mount also includes a support wall located between the end mounting surfaces thereof on one axial side of the associated intermediate mounting surface. Engagement of one side wall of the tool body with the associated support wall on the spindle axially locates the tool along the rotational axis. A central hub of the tool holder provides support thereof about the rotational axis in the preferred construction and has the pair of flanges of each tool mount projecting outwardly therefrom to define the flat end mounting surfaces that mount the associated tool.The support wall of each tool mount also extends outwardly from the hub located between the flangesfthereof on one axial side of the associated intermediate mounting surface. Threaded studs and nuts secure the ends of the tool body to the flanges of the associated tool mount on the spindle and threaded bolts secure the tool body to the associated support wall. A machine disclosed utilizes a pair of the tool spindles each of which mounts a pair of the rotary tools with one tool on each spindle cooperating with one tool on the other spindle to engage and form a round workpiece therebetween upon coordinated rotational driving of the spindles. The diameter of the workpiece which can be formed for any given radius of the tool forming faces is much greater than heretofore possible due to both the tool and the spindle constructions.Any tool or an associated pair of the tools on the tool spindles can be replaced independently of the other tools when necessary due to damage or wear. As such, the tool and spindle constructions are. thus much more economical than would be the case with a single unitary tool having a pair of forming faces. The objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best mode for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is a front elevation view of a rotary forming machine including rotary forming tools and spindles therefor constructed in accordance with the present invention FIGURE 2 is an elevation view taken generally along line 2 2 of FIGURE 1 with the machine illustrated in phantom line representation and the tool spindle and tools shown illustrated in solid line representation and FIGURE 3 is a front elevation view of the tool spindle and tools taken along line 3 3 of FIGURE 2. BEST DIODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to FIGURE 1 of the drawings, a machine generally indicated by reference numeral 10 utilizes rotary forming tool 12 constructed in accordance with this invention and includes spindles 14 that are constructed to mount the tools 12 in accordance with the present invention. A lower base 16 of the machine 10 includes slideways 18 that mount a pair of tool spindle housings 20 for movement to the left and the right with respect to each other. Each spindle housing 20 supports the associated tool spindle 14 about a rotational axis A parallel to the rotational axis of the other tool spindle. An upper housing 22 of the machine is mounted on the lower base 16 and rotatably supports a round workpiece spindle 24 about a rotational axis B parallel to axis A so as to enable a workpiece 26 to be mounted thereby and formed by a pair of tools 12 on the two tool spindles 14 upon coordinated rotational driving thereof and concomitant rotation of the workpiece 26 on its spindle 24. Machine 10 preferably includes the type of drive mechanism disclosed by United States Patent 4,045,988 for rotatively driving the tool spindles 14 and the workpiece spindle 24 during the forming operation. This drive mechanism has provisions for allowing movement of the tool spindle housings 20 toward and away from each other to permit the forming of workpieces 26 having different diameters. Upper housing 22 of the machine 10 shown in FIGURE 1 includes a pair of cast end brackets 28 having lower legs 30 supported on the lower machine base 16 and secured thereto by bolts 32 and associated keys 34. Vertical legs 36 of the brackets 28 extend upwardly from inner ends of the lower legs 30 and have upper ends 38 that extend inwardly toward each other. Upper housing 22 of the machine also includes a connector 40 extending horizontally between the two end brackets 28 and having downwardly extending legs 42 secured to the upper ends 38 of the vertical bracket legs 36 by bolts 44. Pushpull bolt assemblies 46 extend between the end brackets 28 and the spindle housings 20 and have outer wrench ends 48 that are rotated to provide the impetus for moving the spindle housings 20 toward or away from each other. Wedge block assemblies 50 are positioned between the vertical legs 36 of the end brackets 28 and the spindle housings 20 to provide support of the tool spindles in any adjusted position. Each wedge block assembly 50 shown in FIGURE 1 includes one wedge 52 fixedly mounted on the associated tool spindle housing 20 and a vertically movable wedge 54 slidably engaged with a plate 56 on the vertical leg of the adjacent end bracket. A threaded bolt adjuster 58 of each wedge block assembly 50 extends between the vertically movable wedge 54 thereof and the upper end 38 of the adjacent bracket leg 36 and has a wrench end 60 for providing rotation that adjusts the relative position between the two wedges so as to provide support of the tool spindle housings 20 in any adjusted position.Scales 62 on the spindle housings 20 and markers 64 on the lower machine base 16 provide a reference for adjustment of the spindle housings and the tool spindles supported on the housings. As seen in FIGURE 2, each tool spindle housing 20 mounted on the associated base slideway 18 includes an integral rear wall 66 and a separate front wall 68 that is secured by bolts 70 only one shown at a location spaced forwardly from the rear wall. Rear and front antifriction bearings 72 and 74 rotatably mount a spindle drive shaft 76 on the rear and front walls 66 and 68 of the spindle housing along the associated rotational axis A of the spindle. Spindle 14 is fixed on the drive shaft 76 between the rear and front walls 66 and 68 so as to support the pair of rotary tools 12 thereon for rotation about axis A during operation of the machine. As seen by reference to FIGURE 3, each rotary forming tool 12 constructed in accordance with the present invention comprises a tool body 78 of a generally C shape that is preferably rough cast from a suitable tool steel and then finish ground with the construction hereinafter described. Each tool body 78 has a rotational axis along the spindle axis A about which the tool rotates in its mounted relationship on thespindle 14 A partially circular forming face 80 of each tool body 78 extends about the rotational axis A for an angle less than 180 degrees and faces radially outward with respect te the rotational axis so as. to perform forming of the workpiece with the spindle mounted on a machine in the manner previcusly described. The forming face 80 of each tool body extends between leading and trailing ends 82 and 84 thereof and includes forming projec tions 85 positioned therealong in the partially circular shape of the forming face. The leading and trailing ends 82 and 84 of each tool body 78 include flat end support surfaces 86 and 88 that are coplanar with each other and located on one side of the rotational axis A of the tool body. An inner side 90 of each tool body has a concave shape facing inwardly toward the rotational axis A and includes a flat intermediate support surface 92 that extends parallel to the coplanar end support surfaces 86 and 88. The construction of the rotary tool 12 permits rotary forming of larger diameter workpieces than heretofore possible while still permitting replacement of any tool or tools independent of each other tool. Thus, if one of the rotary tools 12 mounted on one of the two tool spindles 14 as shown in FIGURE 1 becomes damaged, the damaged tocl can be replaced independently of the other tools with a consequent savings in the tooling cost. Similarly, either pair of cooperative tools 12 on the two tool spindles can be replaced independently of the other pair which may still have significant useful life so as to likewise provide savings in the tooling cost. As seen in FIGURE 3, the forming projections 85 on the forming face 80 are disclosed as teeth forforming or burnishing teeth or splines on a workpiece and may extend either parallel or helically with respect to the rotational axis depending upon the configuration of the workpiece formations to be formed. Likewise, the forming projections 85 may also be configured to form threads on a workpiece. As seen in FIGURE 3, the leading and trailing ends 82 and 84 of each tool body 78 include locating surfaces 94 and 96 that oppose each other in a parallel relationship. Each of the locating surfaces 94 and 96 has a right angle junction with the adjacent end support surface 86 and 88, respectively. A pair of connecting surfaces 98 of the inner side 90 of each tool body respectively extend between its intermediate support surface 92 and the locating surfaces 94 and 96 at the leading and trailing ends 82 and 84 of the tool body. These connecting surfaces 98 have concave shapes facing inwardly toward the rotational axis A. As illustrated at the leading end of the upper rotary tool body 78 shown in FIGURE 3, a threaded hole 100 at each end support surface 86 and 88 receives a threaded stud 102 for mounting the tool on the associated spindle 14 in cooperation with an associated nut 104. In addition, lateral holes through the tool body receive threaded bolts 106 that are threaded into the associated tool spindle 14 to cooperate with the stud and nut connections 102,104 in mounting the tools as is more fully hereinafter described. With combined reference to FIGURES 2 and 3, each tool body 78 includes a pair of side walls 108 extending between the forming face 80 and inner side 90 thereof in a parallel relationship to each other and a perpendicular relationship to the support surfaces 86, 88, and 92. The rear side wall 108 engages the tool spindle 14 in the mounted condition to locate the tool axially with respect to the rotational axis A. With reference to FIGURE 3, each rotary tool spindle 14 comprises a tool holder 110 having a rotational axis A concentric with the shaft 76 that provides the impetus for driving the spindle. The tool holder 110 has a symmetrical shape about a central plane 112 thereof through the rotational axis A and includes an associated tool mount 114 on each side of the central plane. Each tool mount 114 includes a pair of flat end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 for respectively mounting the leading and trailing end support surfaces 86 and 88 of the associated rotary tool. The end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 of each tool mount 114 are coplanar with each other and extend parallel to the central plane 112 of the tool holder 110 on opposite sides of a perpendicular to the central plane through the rotational axisA. Each of the tool mounts 114 also includes a flat intermediate mounting surface 120 for mounting the intermediate support surface 92 on the associated rotary tool.The intermediate mounting surface 120 of each tool mount is located between the end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 thereof and is positioned radially outward from the end mounting surfaces extending parallel thereto and to the central plane 112 about which the tool holder 110 is symmetrical. As seen by continuing reference to FIGURE 3, each tool mount 114 also includes a pair of locating sur faces 122 and 124 that face away from each other respectively adjacent the end mounting surfaces 116 and 118.Locating surfaces 122 and 124 are each flat and have a right angle junction with the adjacent end mounting surface so as to cooperate therewith in locating the associated rotary tool upon mounting. A pair of flanges 126 and 128 of each tool mount 114 respectively define the end mounting surfaces thereof for mounting the leading and trailing ends of the associated rotary tool. Flanges 126 and 128 of each tool mount 114 are each spaced from the adjacent flanges 128 and 126, respectively, of the other tool mount a sufficient distance to permit the threaded nuts 104 to be received by and detached from the associated threaded studs 102 upon attachment or removal of the tool from the tool holder 110. A support wall 130 of each tool mount 114 on the tool holder 110 is located between the end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 on the flanges 126 and 128 as seen in FIGURE. 3 and engages the rear side wall 108 of the mounted tool 12 as illustrated in FIGURE 2 with the bolts 106 providing a detachable connection of the tool to this wall. The tool holder 110 of each tool spindle 14 as illustrated in FIGURE 3 has a central hub 132 that is secured by a plurality of bolts 134 to an axial face of a flange 136 on the spindle drive shaft 76 and is also rotationally fixed with respect to the shaft by a key 138 such that the hub has a rotational axis A. Both flanges 126 and 128 of each tool mount 114 project outwardly from the central hub 132 to define the associated end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 for supporting the opposite ends of each rotary tool 12. The i,ntermediate support surface 120 of each tool mount 114 is also defined on the central hub 132 as are the locating surfaces 122 and 124 respectively adjacent the flanges 126 and 128.It will be noted that the location of the support wall 130 between the flanges facilitates machining of the end mounting surfaces 116 and 118 and the locating surfaces 122 and 124 by allowing a straight pass with a milling cutter or a grinding wheel to machine these surfaces. While the best mode for practicing the invention has been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the present invention as defined by the following claims.
