# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF UREA

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide at an elevated temperature and pressure in first and second reaction zones, and the removal of non converted ammonium carbamate from the urea synthesis solution in first and second stripping zones, wherein the first reaction zone is adapted such that the contents thereof are in indirect heat exchange with the contents of the first stripping zone. Ammonia and carbon dioxide are at least in part reacted to form ammonium carbamate and the ammonium carbamate is in part con verted to urea in the first reaction zone, and the resulting effluent is introduced into the second reaction zone wherein further urea formation is effected to form a urea synthesis solution containing non converted ammonium carbamate. A portion of the urea synthesis solution is introduced into the first stripping zone and another portion is introduced into the second stripping zone wherein the respective portions are heated and stripped to decompose at least part of the ammonium carbamate and form a gas mixture containing ammonia and carbon dioxide. The gas mixture thus formed in the second stripping zone is condensed in the first reaction zone in a manner such that the heat of condensation therein produced is exchanged with the urea synthesis solution in the first stripping zone so as to provide at least a portion of the heat required for the ammonium carbamate decomposi tion.
