# Information processor having an interruption operating function.

## Abstract
An information processor has at least one interface unit by which the processor is coupled to a peripheral equipment. The interface unit can selectively generates either a first mode signal or a second mode signal when the processor performs an interruption operation according to request from the peripheral equipment. When the processor per forms the interruption operation in response to the first mode signal, a stack operation for saving information necessary to restart a program execution which is stopped by the interruption to a stack memory is performed before start of the interruption operation. While the processor can perform the interruption operation in response to the second mode signal without the stack operation, whereby an improved processor with less overhead can be provided.
