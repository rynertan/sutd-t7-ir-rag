# Apparatus for digitally controlled calibration of frequency response of amplifiers.

## Abstract
A system for tailoring the frequency response of the amplifier of an AC volt meter during calibration, comprising an adjustable filter 22 consisting of a primary resistor 12 and a number of differently valued capacitors 24 27 connected together through a corresponding number of switches 28 31 within an array. During a calibration mode, a test voltage is applied to the input of the amplifier, and the microprocessor switches different values of the capacitors in circuit with the amplifier. The combination of capacitors that causes the frequency response of the amplifier to match most closely with a predetermined response is selected for calibration.
