# SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A silver halide photographic light sensitive material is described, comprising a support, at least one light sensitive silver haiide emulsion layer on the support, and at least one light insensitive top layer provided on the emulsion layer, wherein at least one of the emulsion layer and other consti tuent layers contains a compound represented by the gen eral formula I R¹ NHNH G R² I wherein R¹ is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, R² is a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group, or a substituted or unsubstitut ed aryloxy group, and G is a carbonyl group, a sulfonyl group, a sulfoxy group, a phosphoryl group, or an N substi tuted or unsubstituted imino group and wherein said at least one light insensitive top layer is hardened so as to have a melting time at least 50 seconds longer than that of the emulsion layer. This material enables the formation of a ne gative image having super contrast with a stable processing solution.
