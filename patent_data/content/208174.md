# Novel inertance loop construction for air sweep fluidic oscillator.

## Abstract
A fluid oscillator for issuing a sweeping jet of air has a continuous inertance loop which has a section passing through the power nozzle of the fluidic oscillator. The continuous inertance loop is essentially coplanar with the plane of the fluidic oscillator so the basic oscillator element can be two identical molded parts which snap fit together.
