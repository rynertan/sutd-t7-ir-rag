# Method and apparatus for veryfying personal identification numbers and checking stored number series in identification media.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for verifying a personal identification number and checking a number series put onto an identification medium, containing machine readable, information in the form of a card or account number and permanent information in the form of a permanently in scribed number, include a first unit 2,4,22,6,8,10, 12,14,16,18,20 for encryption of the card or account number PAN with an algorithm defined by a first key. The first unit includes means 6,8,10,12,14,16,18 for forming the first key of the personal identification number PIN in combination with a first key number K1 . The apparatus further contains a second unit 30,32,42,34,36,12,14,40,38 for generating a personal check number PCN by decryption of coded information obtained from the first unit with the aid of an algorithm defined by a second key. A third unit 44,46,49,24,70,66,68,80,82,64,76 is further adapted for en crypting the card or account number with the aid of the algorithm defined by the first key, and a fourth unit 44,48,52,24,70,72,72,74,82,64,88 is adapted for encrypting the personal check number with the aid of the algorithm defined by the second key. A comparison circuit 58 , connected to the outputs from the third and fourth units, compares the coded card or account number and the coded personal check number for determining whether these numbers have a predetermined relationship. The second and fourth units include means 42,34,36,12,14,40,38 72,74,82,64,88 for forming the second key from the perma nent number FN in combination with a second key number K2 .
