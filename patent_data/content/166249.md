# Interlocking building blocks and system for using the same.

## Abstract
A family of interlocking polyurethane foam building blocks configured similarly to conventional concrete building blocks. Tongues 62, 64 and grooves 66, 68 are formed on the end faces 54, 56 of a universal block 40 in such a manner that the end faces of two identical blocks will engage with one an other when the blocks are longitudinally aligned and the end faces are in abutment. The tongues and grooves are config ured so that the building blocks may be rotated about any axis of the block and still interlock with an identical block. The upper and lower surfaces 50, 52 of the universal block 40 are formed with projections 70, 72 and recesses 74, 76 con figured to engage with the projections and recesses on an abuting surface of an identical block that is longitudinally offset by one half the length of the block. The projections and re cesses are configured and arranged to allow the universal block to be rotated about any axis of the block and still inter lock with an identical block. A corner block, half block, three quarter block, pilaster block, and bond beam block constitute the rest of the family of building blocks. These blocks are con figured to interlock with the universal block and allow con truction of a walled structure using conventional concrete block building techniques.
