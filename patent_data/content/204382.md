# High pressure sodium discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure sodium dis charge lamp intended to be operated in conjunction with an external starter or with an internal starter without a glow discharge. The lamp has an outer bulb which is provided with a lamp cap and encloses an evacuated space in which a discharge vessel is arranged. According to the invention, the space enclosed by the outer bulb further accommodates a closed holder, whose wall mainly comprises glass forming constituents and which contains at least helium. Thus, it is achieved that the lamp has a strongly reduced increase in lamp voltage during the life.
