# Stabilized poly arylene sulfide composition, process for melt extruding such composition and use of organotin stabilizers in poly arylene sulfide resins.

## Abstract
The heat stability of arylene sulfide resins, such as poly p phenylene sulfide resin, is improved by the addition of cure re tarders comprising certain organotin compounds such as the dialkyltin dicarboxylates. The resin compositions of the inven tion are particularly applicable for reducing gel formation dur ing melt extrusion.
