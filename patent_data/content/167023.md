# An improved method for converting a bit map of an image to a run lenght or run end representation.

## Abstract
A method for converting an image from a bit map to a run end or run length representation includes the steps of storing the image as a bit map representation accessing for each byte in an image by a look up table a selected routine, corresponding to such byte, from a number of routines for converting bit strings to run representations, wherein the look up table accessed is selected in accordance with a color value of a preceding pixel binary bit and executing the selected routine on the current byte to convert the bit string to a run representation storing in a run representation buffer, as a count value, each run representation repeating the above steps of accessing and executing for each byte and storing for each run of continuous color to the end of the image.
