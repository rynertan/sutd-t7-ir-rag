# A NOVEL HYBRID INTERFERON SPECIES

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel hybrid interferon species that comprises a chain of 161 and or 162 amino acids. The hybrid is novel not only for its new structure, but also because the hybrid comprises a shortened or truncated segment of alpha interferon and hence is an entirely new interferon species that does not occur in nature. The invention further provides pharmaceutical composi tions containing said novel interferons DNA sequences coding for said novel interferons vectors containing and capable of expressing said DNA sequences hosts transformed with said vectors and methods for producing these products.
