# Method and device for the compaction of soil.

## Abstract
When compacting soil a vibration mass bearing on the ground is caused to vibrate, wherein the vibration process is controlled in dependence on the behaviour of the mass spring system, part of which being constituted by the soil. Tests have shown that in comparison with fall weights soil can be compacted up to the same extent in a shorter period of time or can be compacted to a greater extent in a same period of time.
