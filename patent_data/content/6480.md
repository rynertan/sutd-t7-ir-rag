# Method and apparatus for generating error locating and parity check bytes.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a method and apparatus for generating error locating and parity check bytes for a block of data bytes each consisting of k bits. The data bytes are presented in series to a data reg ister 10 and fed in parallel to three channels 21, 22 and 23 . Each channel has a random access memory including three registers and a memory address circuit operated, under the control of control means 20 , to address the three registers cyclically. The first data byte is combined with the output from the first register of each random ac cess memory, the second data byte with the output from the second register and the third byte with the output from the third register whereupon the cycle is repeated. The result is to generate three parity check bytes in the channel 21 , three error locating check bytes in channel 22 and three error locating check bytes in channel 23 corre sponding respectively to three interleaved subsets of the block of data bytes. The check bytes for each subset of data bytes can be used to locate and correct any one data byte in error in the subset. However, the check bytes of all three subsets taken together can be used to locate and correct an error spanning a series of adjacent data bytes including one data byte from each subset.
