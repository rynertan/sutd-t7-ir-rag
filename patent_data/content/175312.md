# Process for preparing optically active hydantoins.

## Abstract
A process for preparing optically active hydantoins hav ing the general formula II The present invention provides a process for an optical resolution with a high efficiency which can be used for the synthesis of S 6 fluoro spiro chroman 4,4 imidazoli dine 2 ,5 dione USAN Sorbinil , which is an optically ac tive hydantoins attracting public attention as a preventive or a remedy for the particular chronic symptoms of diabetes such as cataract and neuropathy, and S α methyl 3,4 di hydroxyphenylalanine L methyldopa , which is an optically active amino acid widely used as antihypertensives. Fur ther, the present invention provides a novel finding that N carbamoyl α amino acid having no hydrogen atom on its α carbon atom can be biochemically converted into hydan toins by an enzymatic cyclization reaction.
