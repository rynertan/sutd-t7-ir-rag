# A recuperative heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A recuperative heat exchanger for gas gas heat exchange at a temperature above 700 C, comprising a refractory lined vessel having a vertically extending steel shell 2 closed at top and bottom by respective ends 3,4 , wherein the space within the vessel is divided into respective top and bottom end cham bers and a heat exchange chamber therebetween by top and bottom apertured refractory plates and the end chambers are connected by a plurality of substantially vertical tubes of refrac tory ceramic material extending between said plates. To provide good contact of the second heat exchange medium with the tubes, connections 5, 6 for respectively supply and discharge of a first one of the heat exchange media are provided in said ends, and on one side of said steel shell there are a plurality of connections 10 for supply of the second of the heat exchange media distributed over a region extending both vertically and circumferentially and on the other side of the steel shell there are a plurality of connections 15 for discharge of the second medium also distributed over a region extending both vertically and circumferentially. The connections 10, 15 for supply and discharge of the second medium being connected via respective manifolds 9, 14 to main supply and discharge conduits respec tively.
