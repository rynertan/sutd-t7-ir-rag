# ROOFLIGHT

## Abstract
An arch shaped or barrel rooflight comprises several jux taposed arch shaped glazing panels 1 interconnected along their edges by glazing bars 4 . In a single glazed case the glazing bars comprise upper and lower bar members 21 and 22 supported on a receiving frame 7 on an upstand from a roof. The two bar members grip the edges of the panels but are themselves spaced apart to avoid a thermal bridge. The bar members are held together by means of the tension gen erated in the upper by an axial bolt 36 fixed to the receiving frame. A complementary compression is induced in the lower bar member.
