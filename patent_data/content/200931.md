# Air pollution control system method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A pollution control system includes a condenser and filtering unit for removing vaporized organic solvents and particulate matter. The condenser includes baffles that de fine vertical flow paths, and hot exhaust gases are directed from above to alternate flow paths to flow downward while atmospheric air is directed upwardly through the remaining flow paths to cool the exhaust gases and the heated air is used to maintain the atmospheric air above a selected temperature. The filter unit includes a horizontal movable filter which is automatically replaced with a new filter sec tion when the pressure differential across the filter exceeds a certain level.
