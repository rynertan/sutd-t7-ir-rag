# Resonator for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A resonator for internal combustion engines, having an enclosed chamber of predetermined volumn connected to an intake duct by a tubular connecting member which is composed of an external member and an internal member. The internal member is disposed within the external member and moved by an actuator which is controlled by an electrical signal corresponding to a resonant frequency calculated by a computer in synchronism with engine rotational speeds. The resonator thereby functions to absorb resonant noises from the engines by appropriately changing the length and or cross sectional area of the tubular connecting member.
