## Description
The present invention relates to novel diamine derivatives useful in the treatment of arrythmias. The compounds claimed by the present invention are novel and have not been reported in literature. Antiarrythmics currently used in clinical applications include lidocaine, disopyramide and procainamide. Lidocaine is suitable for intravenous or intramuscular administration British Medical Journal, Procainamide is known to have the disadvanage of exhibiting anti cholinergic and amyocardiac activities and causing hypotension Medicina, vol. 20, No. 7, p. 1115, 1983 and Gekkan Yakuji, vol. 26, No. 5, p. 155, 1984 . The present inventors made concerted efforts to develop drugs that have minimum side effects while exhibiting potent antiarrythmic activity. As a result, they found that the compounds claimed by the present invention are free from all the defects of the existing antiarrythmics described above. The compound of formula I of the present invention may be prepared by reacting a chloroalkylanilide derivative of formula II with a diamine derivative of formula III in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. The reaction scheme may be represented as follows Although a solvent useful for the reaction of a chloroalkylanilide II with a diamine III includes solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, etc. which are usually used in a reaction similar to the above reaction, benzene, toluene and xylene are preferable. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent used for about 3 to 24 hours while stirring the reaction system. Although a base useful for the reaction includes organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine and the like, and inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and the like, the organic bases are preferable. Stated more specifically, R₁ and R₂ in formula I may be a methyl or ethyl group, with methyl being preferable R₃ may be a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, with hydrogen being preferable R₄ and R₅ may be a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, an iso propyl group, a n butyl group, an iso butyl group, a tert butyl group, a n hexyl group or a cyclooctyl group, with methyl, ethyl, iso propyl and iso butyl being preferable m may be an integer of 2 to 5, with 2 or 3 being preferable n may be an integer of 2 to 7, with 2 or 3 being preferable.

The compounds of the present invention exhibit a marked antiarrythmic activity with reduced side effects. The following are the results of experiments conducted to demonstrate the advantages of these compounds which were used in the form of corresponding salts unless otherwise noted. The following procedures were substantially in accordance with the method of Erker and Baker Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., Selected compounds suspended in 3 gum arabic were administered in various doses to the rats either intraperitoneally i.P. or perorally P.O. 30 minutes prior to treatment with chloroform. The percent prevention of ventricular fibrillation was determined for each rat. Only a 3 gum arabic solution was administered to the control group. The results are shown in Table 2. Using Sprague Dowley male rats 9 10 wk. old, two animals per group weighing about 350 g on average, the following experiment was conducted substantially in compliance with the method of Vargftig et al. Europ. J. Pharmacol., The animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 1 g kg of urethane. A polyethylene cannula was inserted into both the femoral artery and vein of each animal the drug was administered through the femoral vein while the blood pressure was measured at the femoral artery. While the aconitine solution was continuously infused into the vein at a rate of 1 µg kg min, a selected compound was administered intravenously at 5 minute intervals. In order to prevent the aconitine induced dyspnea from interfering with the experimental results, 0.2 mg kg of d tubocurarine was administered intravenously to each animal, which then was subjected to artificial respiration through a cannula inserted into the trachea 80 breathings min, with 4 ml of air supplied by a single ventillation . Identification of arrythmia was made by the ECG in the second induction period the appearance of a QRS complex with sharply downward deflections was used as an indication of ventricular arrythmia and observation was continued until ventricular fibrillation appeared. The results are shown in Table 3 in terms of the times required for ventricular extrasystole and ventricular fibrillation to occur. Hartly male guinea pigs 5 6 wk. old, two animals per group weighing about 350 g on average were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 1.2 g kg of urethane. A polyethylene cannula was inserted into both the cervical vein and the carotid artery the drug was administered through the cervical vein while the blood pressure was measured at the carotid artery. A selected test compound was administered 5 minutes before the sustained intravenous infusion of the ouabain solution 5 µg kg min as described in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., SD Slc male rats 10 mo. old, four animals per group were clubbed dead and their ilea were immediately extracted. The ilea were suspended under a load of 1 g in a Krebs Henseleit solution oxygenated with a mixture of 95 O₂ 5 CO₂ at 27 C, and the ileal reaction was measured isotonically. The anti cholinergic activity of each of the compounds tested was determined in terms of percent inhibition against the contractive reaction of 10 ⁶M of acetylcholine causing 60 70 of the maximum contractive reaction of acetylcholine . The results are shown in Table 5. Beagle dogs were anesthetized by intravenous administration of pentobarbital 35 mg kg . The following experiment was conducted in accordance with the method of Sato et al. Tohoku J. Exp. Med., One minute before the acetylcholine administration, 100 g 0.1 ml of a selected compound was administered intra arterially and its ability to inhibit saliva excretion was examined. The results are shown in Table 6. A selected compound of the present invention was administered perorally to ddY Slc male rats 5 6 wk. old, 10 animals per group in an amount of 50 or 100 mg kg. One hour later, 2.5 mg kg of hexobarbital was administered intraperitoneally to each animal, thereby causing the loss of orthogonal reflex. The time required for the recovery of orthogonal reflex was measured for each animal. As comparative drugs, 50 or 100 mg kg of disopyramide and 5 mg kg of diazepam were administered perorally. The results are shown in Table 7. After starving SD Slc male rats body weight, 250 g 6 animals per group overnight, 20 µl blood samples were drawn from the tail vein of each rat while it was not anesthetized. Records were taken of the sugar level in each blood sample. A selected compound of the present invention was suspended in 3 gum arabic and the suspension was administered perorally to each rat in an amount of 50 or 200 mg kg. At 2, 4 and 6 hours of the administration, blood samples were taken and their blood sugar levels were measured. Measuremetns of blood sugar levels were conducted with a New Blood Sugar Test Boehringer, Mannheim . To the control group, a 3 gum arabic solution was administered, and diisopyramide was adminstered as a comparative drug. The results are shown in Table 8. As is demonstrated by the experimental results shown above, the compounds of the present invention have a broad spectrum of effectiveness for the treatment of arrythmias originating in both the ventricle and atrium. In particular, the compounds exhibited a sustained anti arrythmic activity over a prolonged period. They have no such side effects as anti cholinergic activity, central nerve depressant activity and the blood sugar reducing activity which is undesirable in the treatment of arrythmias. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention have potential for use as highly safe and effective antiarrythmic agents.
