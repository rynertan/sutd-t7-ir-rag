# Television transmission system.

## Abstract
A high definition colour television transmission system in which wide band luminance information Y, is utilised to produce a first luminance information portion comprising lower frequency 0 to 3.8 MHz and middle frequency 3.8 to 5.5 MHz components and a second luminance information portion comprising the middle frequency 3.8 to 5.5 MHz and upper frequency 5.5 to 8.8 MHz components. The first lumin ance information portion Y1, is transmitted by way of a first transmission path together with a colour subcarrier f The two transmissions may be jointly received for the pro vision of a high definition display but the invention has the dis tinct advantage that the signal of te first transmission path may be received alone by currently manufactured television receiv ers for reproduction of a display of a quality which is accepted as normal.
