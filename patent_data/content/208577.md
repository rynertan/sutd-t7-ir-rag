# Method of controlling dopant diffusion and dopant electrical activation.

## Abstract
A method for preparing semiconductor components hav ing a structure with sharply defined spatial distributions of dopant atoms with control over the degree of electrical activa tion of the dopant atoms. Control of spatial distribution and the degree of electrical activation of dopant atoms is achieved by implantation of dopant atoms along with rare gas atoms and another type of dopant atom within substantially the same preselected depth boundaires of a silicon or germanium substrate.
