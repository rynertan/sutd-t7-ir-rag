## Description
SHOCK ABSORBER IN A CAR SUSPENSION DescriptionThe present invention is directed to a shock absorber in a suspension for vehicles and in particular, to a suspension in motor cars.As is known, a shock absorber for a car suspension, commonly called the McPherson type, generally comprises a cylinder piston unit with its relative rod, and a spring coaxial to the cited group.In these applications, there are verified some drawbacks, arising from the existence of forces transversal to the shock absorber, that tend to bend the rod.In fact, the ground reaction transmitted to the wheel multiplied by the lever arm existing between the wheel and the lower connection to the wheel hub of the shock absorber, originates a torque whose direction is such, as to cause the cited bending of the rod.In its turn, the bending of the rod can give rise to crawlings in the shock absorber, a wearing out of the gaskets inside the cylinder and, in general, prove to be negative for having a correcting functioning of the shock absorber.According to a known solution, it was endeavoured to overcome the cited drawback by having recourse to an opportune inclination of the metallic helicoidal spring disposed around the shock absorber.As a matter of fact, it was found through the choice of an opportune angle of inclination for said spring, that it was possible to oppose said originating of bending in the rod. However, said solution can result as being unsatisfactory because the pre selected angle of inclination is not always such as to compensate the thrusts transversal to the shock absorber.What is more, there are some applications that require a certain amount of space for allowing said inclination of the helicoidal spring, and not always is the space available sufficient enough for this purpose.Moreover, there also exist some particular applications which require the use of a phneumatic spring commonly known as an air spring, and these pnuematic springs cannot be inclined, with respect to the axis of the rod so as to obtain the cited balancing of the thrusts transversal to the rod.Hence, what constitutes the object of the present invention is a shock absorber in a suspension for vehicles, that comprises in between the hub and the chassis of the vehicle, a cylinder piston unit with its relative rod, and a spring coaxial to said unit, the said shock absorber being characterized by the fact of comprising means for balancing the thrusts acting in the direction transversal to the rod.The present invention will be better comprehended from the following detailed description made solely by way of non limiting example, with referring to the figures of the attached drawing TABLES, wherein FIG. 1 shows a design of a shock absorber, according to the invention, FIG. 2 shows an elargement of a detail in FIG. 1.FIG. 2 shows a top view of FIG.2. FIG. 3 shows, in a transversal section orthogonal to the axis of the shock absorber, an asymmetrical elastomeric block apt for compensating the transversal thrusts on the shock absorber.FIGS. 4 and 5 are transversal sections at diverse heights of FIG. 2, taken along the lines IV IV and V V.FIG. 6 shows a design of a solution in the state of the art.FIG. 7 shown a variation of the invention.FIG. 8 shows a part of FIG. 7.In FIG. 1 the numeral 1, indicates a shock absorber for a vehicle suspension, and, in particular, a suspension for a motor car.The shock abosorber 1 comprises a cylinder piston unit 2 with its relative rod 3. The unit 2 is associated, in a known way, to the hub 4 of a wheel 5.Between the rod 3 and the chassis 6 of the motor car, there is interposed a special block 7 made of an elastomeric material for example natural rubber having a hardness that can be comprised within the range of a minimum value of 450 Shore A to a maximum value of 750Shore A.More particularly, as can be seen in FIG.2, at the extremity of the rod 3 and around it, against the ledge 8 of said rod, there are superimposed from bottom to top , a rigid cylindrical cup shaped container 9, a rigid lamel 10, a roller bearing or ball bearing 11 that allows for the rotation of the system during the steering phase of the vehicle, a rigid slab 12 with a hollow seat apt for receiving the bearing 11. The slab 12, in one example, is realized with a surface that is first conical 13 and then cylindrical 13 .The lower surface of the elastomeric block 7 is fixed on the surface of the slab 12, through a rubber to metal bonding.The various superimposed elements are locked at the extremity of the rod 3, through the means of a screw nut 14.The elastomeric block is fixed, through a rubber to metal bonding, to surfaces that are made solidal with the chassis and the slab 12.Around the lateral surface of the container 9, there is disposed the upper extremity 15 of an air spring 16 of the known type such as that used in some applications relative to the McPherson suspensions.The air spring 16 is locked stably, in its furthermost position, to the rigid container, through an indeformable ring 17. As can be seen in FIG. 2, the elastomeric membrane of the spring 16, comprises the beads 16 in abutment on the lamel 10.Next, the lower end of the air spring 16 is fixed to a rigid annular element 18 made of resin or metal, resting on a rigid bracket 18 fixed around the cylinder.Between the rigid element 18 and the external part of the cylinder there is interposed an elastomeric sealing ring 19 made, for example, of natural rubber having a Shore A hardness comprised between 450 and 750. The main characteristic of the bonding between shock absorber and chassis, consists in the special configuration of the elastomeric block.As can be seen in FIG. 2, on the drawing plane, the blocks present an asymmetrical configuration with respect to the axis of the rod.In practice, the quantity of elastomeric material in the block 7 on the part opposite the wheel 5, as with respect to the rod axis, is greater than the remaining portion of elastomeric material.It has been found convenient, for the purpose of the invention, to realize a block 7, that is distributed with a first portion along an arc of a circle subtended from centre angles between 900 and 2700, with a greater radial thickness than that of the remaining second annular portion of the block itself. In a particular realization, the block at mid height in a transversal cross section, orthogonal to the rod axis, can present FIG. 3 a radial thickness for example, for an arc of a circle subtended by a centre angle of 2700, that is double the thickness of the remaining annular portion of the block.In other solutions, the block as can be seen in FIG. 2, and in the transversal cross sections orthogonal to the rod axis of FIGS. 4 and 5 , in the zone having a lesser elastic reaction, gradually varies the radial thickness from a maximum value at the lower extremity to a minimum value practically null at the opposite extremity.In practice, in all the solutions adopted, there is a tendency to render the reaction of the block to be asymmetrical i.e. there is a tendency to cause the right hand portion of FIG. 2 of the block, to react more than the left hand portion. With the above cited realization, a compensating is obtained of the thrusts transversal the shock absorber, which would have tended to bend the rod.These undesirable solutions are determined, as is known, by the reaction T FIG. 1 due to the ground force transmitted to the wheel and the consequent mechanical torqure Z origiated by the result of said force T for the arm b, between the wheel and the point where the shock absorber is bonded to the wheel hub.With the present solution, in the presence of the thrustF, on the shock abosrber applied to the center of the block, it is so had that the same block FIGS. 2 and I react more in the right hand part of FIG. 2 than on the left hand part, with determining a torque F x a, that contrasts the torque that would have the tendency to bend the rod. All this is obtained through a simple an opportune II 1W calibrating of the lever arm a The solution of the invention that was described above solely by way of non limiting example, relative to a shock absorber that comprises an air spring disposed around a cylinder, can likewise be applied to a shockabsorber that comprises a helicoidal spring disposed around the cylinder.In this case, the helicoidal spring results as having its central axis aligned with the axis of the rod.Therefore, the present solution is clearly distinguished from those of the past whereby the compensation of the thrusts transversal to the rod, were actuated by inclining the helicoidal spring with respect to the rod axis, at angles comprised between 50 and 120, subtstantially as is shown schematically in FIG. 6. In FIG. 7, there is shown still another variation of the invention wherein the compensation of the transversal forces, that would tend to bend the rod, is obtained through a balancing thrust that acts directly on the cylinder i.e. instead of on the rod.Said solution again comprises a shock absorber 20 with a cylinder piston unit 21 and the relative rod 22.The cylinder is connected to the wheel hub 23 and the upper extremity of the rod is, in its turn, connected to the chassis.Around the rod, there is disposed an air spring 26 that is connected, by its upper extremity 27, to parts made solid with the rod, and by its lower extremity through a rigid element 28 disposed around it, to parts made solid with the cylinder.The rigid element 28, is fixed to the edges of the lower membrane and has a substantially cylindrical inner surface and a substantially conical outer surface.The rigid element 28 rests upon an elastomeric block 29 that, in its turn, is connected through a rubber to metal bonding, to a bracket 30 which is solidly connected to the outer wall of the cylinder.Between the lateral surface of the rigid element 28 and the outer wall of the cylinder, there is interposed an elastomeric sealing ring 31. The elastomeric block 29 has an asymmetrical configuration with the same characteristics of form and of distribution as was already described with reference to the elastomeric block of FIGS. 1 and 2.The asymmetry of the elastomeric block 29 is chosen in such a way as to create an asymmetrical reaction. In practice, when the elastomeric block 29 is loaded, it reacts upon the left hand portion of the shock absorber axis, with a force R that is prevalent with respect to that upon the right hand side of the same axis FIG. 8 .The effect of the force R is, in practice, that of generating a moment W that would tend to press the portion of the elastomeric sealing ring 31 at the left hand side of the cylinder.The torque W, as shown in FIG. 8, depends upon the result ofK x c where c is the lever arm between the ring 31 and the rigid bracket, and K is the force transmitted to the cylinder.The ring reacts to this torque W, with a force that originates a moment having an opposing direction, in such a way as to compensate the moment which the ground transmits through the wheel, to the lower extremity of the shock absorbing cylinder.As an alternative to the previously given solution, a metallic helicoidal spring can be foreseen, in the place of the air spring, with in this case, avoiding the inclination of the helicoidal spring for compen sating the transversal thrusts acting on the shock absorber. In particular, the solution of FIG. 7 presents the advantage of acting directly on the cylinder with hence, avoiding stresses, of any whatseover type, on the rod.In general, what has also to be emphasized, is how the realizations shown in the figures of the present invention, result as being indispensible for all those cases requiring the position of the air spring around the shock absorber i.e. those cases where, as stated, for compensating the transversl thrusts, it is not possible to incline the air springs. Although some particular forms of particularly advantageous realizations of the invention have been described here, what has also to be kept in mind is that, within the ambit of protection for this patent, there are also included all those alternative variations derived from the above given inventive principle, which are available to one skilled in the art.
