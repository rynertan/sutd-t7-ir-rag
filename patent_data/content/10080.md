# Overspeed safety device.

## Abstract
In a pneumatically powered grinding machine pro vided with a flyweight operated speed governor there is incorporated an independently operating overspeed safety device which in case of malfunction of the speed governor is intended to obstruct further motive air supply to the motor of the machine. The overspeed safety device com prises an annular valve disc 40 having two centrifugal weights 41 which together with a suspender plate 43 form a latch means by which the valve disc 40 is kept in open position at motor speeds not exceeding a predeter mined level. In its open position, the valve disc 40 is elas tically bent about a diameter line as a result of the latch engagement between the centrifugal weights 41 and the suspender plate. When the predetermined speed limit is reached, the valve disc 40 is released from the suspender plate to occupy, while resuming its original flat shape, an air supply obstructing, closed position. The safety device is not resettable without dismantling the machine.
