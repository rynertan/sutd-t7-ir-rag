# Heat shield arrangements.

## Abstract
A heat shield arrangement for strip material employs insulating panels 20, 22, 24 that include an upper series 20 displaceable upwardly by power actuation means 48 to avoid damage by buckled or lifting material. Protective elements 40 projecting below the upper panels 20 are associated with sensing means 51, 51a to actuate the raising of the upper panels 20 and are on mountings 42 able to have a limited displacement before the raising of the upper panels 20 is actuated. The power actuation means 48 act on said mountings 42 to determine the minimum force from the material that causes raising of said panels 20 . To lead in deformed stock there is an increased height entry region comprising a reinforced upper structure, possibly followed by upper and lower insulating panels at decreasing heights from each other to merge into a main region of limited height. The panels may have heating means to give the strip a more uniform transverse temperature profile.

## Description
THEME SHIELD ARRANGEMENTS This invention relates to heat shield arrangements and is concerned particularly, but not exclusively, with heat shields for use in metal processing plant, s ch as hot strip mills. It has previously been proposed to conserve heat of hot stee strip in its passage through a hot rolling mlll by providing a shield of heat insulating panels adjacent the strip British Patent 1 . 1 040 420 , especially at the delay table of the rill. Although it has also been proposed to arrange such panels so that they are displaceable towards and flay from the strip in order to control their shielding effect, it is desirable to arrange that such panels are capable of being positioned as close to the strip as possible in normal operation, so that they exercise a more uniform effect over the width of the strip. The reduction of the gap between the strip and the panels, is liml ted, however, by the need to allow for introduction o he strip past the panels and then to allow for deflections and transient displacements of the strip transverse to its travel direction. The panels, if they are to be both efficient and economical, will have a relatively thin walled construction and they are therefore susceptible to damage if struck by the metal strip as it moves along its travel path. This damage is particularly likely to occur to tne upper panels, because the roll table itself offers some protection for the lower panels. To protect the upper panels it is possible to provide sensors below the surface of the upper panels but above the usual position of the strip material these sensors will then detect any lifting of the material and can actuate raising means to lift the upper panels clear of the material. however, there may be no resultant advantage in this, because there is the disadvantage that the sheet material will itself be adversely affected by the uncontrolled cooling that occurs when the upper panels are raised.There will be many instances when the rolling process has been interrupted unnecessarily, with consequent increase of costs and delay, because the lifting of the strip material would not have caused damage to the panels. According to the present invention, there is provided a heat shield arrangement for a heated length of strip material e.g. a slab or sheet comprising heatinsulating panels arranged adjacent to a travel path for the material and including a series of upper panels extending over said path, displacenent means comprising power actuation means for raising said upper panels away from said path being actuablè,by sensing means responsive to lifting or upward deformation of the strip, said power actuation means influencing the operation of the sensing means to determine the magnitude of the upwards force from the strip at which the sensing means responds, whereby the panels are maintained in operative lowered positions in normal operating conditions until said determined force is exceeded. Preferably, protective bumper or fender elements project below the upper panels. These elements may be fixed relative to the upper panels but preferably they are carried by mounting means that permit some displacement relative to the panels. The sensing means may similarly be fixed relative to the upper panels but preferably comprise elements also mounted in a relatively displaceable manner, advantageously on said protective element mounting means. The invention makes it possible to provide a relatively restricted vertical spacing between the upper and lower panels without disturbing that spacing except in case of need. Problems can arise, however, because although during rolling the main extent of a slab or strip will usually be relatively flat, its ends can be turned up i.e. curved upwards or downwards to a certain degree because of the forces applied to each end portion as it passes unsupported through a set of rolls, and the effective height of the material may be increased thereby to many times the material thickness.This effect is particularly marked when a strip is rolled in a semicontinuous mill having reversing roughing roll stands through which the initial slab is passed forwards and backwards repeatedly to reduce its thickness, but in a continuous mill the leading end of the strip will also be deformed in a similar way. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a heat shield arrangement with heatinsulating panels arranged adjacent to a travel path at least an intermediate region longitudinally of said path where upper and lower series of panels are disposed with a limited vertical spacing between them to form a travel path of restricted height, and wherein at an entry region of the arrangement an increased height passage is prodded for the introduction of a turned up strip material, said entry passage decreasing in height to lead into the limited vertical spacing of said intermediate region. This measure can be employed with particular advantage in combination with the displacement means operable in dependence on the force of the lifted material, as aforesaid, since the entry region may offer sufficient resistance to reduce the turn up of the leading end of the material and so help to minimise the vertical spacing between the upper and lower insulating panel in the intermediate part of the heat shield arrangement. The employment of an increased height entry section is, however, also of value if the aforesaid displacenent means are not provided. It is possible for the entry region, especially if relatively short, to comprise a relatively robust bar or frame structure with little heat insulating effect if any, but it will be preferred, particularly if it is required to provide a relatively large maximum height entry, that at least a part of the entry region is composed of upper and lower heat insulating panels the vertical distance between which panels is progressively reduced along the length of the material path towards said intermediate region. In an arrangement in which the main or intermediate path of the channel path has a relatively uniform insulating effect due to the closeness of the upper and lower panels, the benefit of this may be partly lost where the panels must be more widely spaced apart, for example at an increased height entry region. In such cases, to obtain the desired degree of uniformity of heat insulation it may be preferred to provide panels at the sides of the strip travel path, with heating elements disposed on or within at least some of said side panels. In this way it is possible to counteract the greater heat loss from the edges of the material due to the additional surface area, and especially at the ends of the heat shield arrangement where in addition to any increased spacing of the upper and lower panels, the panels may themselves not be close to the heated material temperature. In any event, the panels are preferably so arranged that they provide an enclosure. that substantially completely surrounds the material path. Alternatively, it may be sufficient to arrange that there is substantially no straight line path for heat radiation from the strip past the panels transverse to the travel path of the strips As a further measure to avoid damage to the insulating panels, protective bumper or fender elements may project from the inner surfaces of said panels towards the material path below and at the sides of the panels and are preferably connected directly to a rigid supporting structure. The invention will be described in more detail by AJ8y of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is an isometric view of a heat shield arrangement having upper panel displacement means according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a fluid control diagram for the panel displacement means of the arrangement in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a schematic side view of a heat shield arrangement according to the invention between successive roll stands in a continuous rolling mill, Sig. 4 shows to a larger scale a detail of the entry end of the heat shield arrangement of Fig. 3, Fig. 5 is a schematic side view of a heat shield arrangement according to the invention between successive roll stands in a semi continuous rolling mill, Fig. 6 is a sectional view on the line X X inFig. 7, Fig. 7 is a schematic illustration to explain the manner in which different heat loss rates occur over the width of a hot strip, and Fig. 8 is a diagrammatic sectional view of a heat shield arrangement having side insulating panels with heating means according to the invention. Pig. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a heat shield arrangement in the form of a self contained module that can be fitted into an existing rolling mill installation. The module comprises top, bottom and side panels 20, 22, 24 respectively supported on a rigid frame 26 having mounting flanges 28. Elongated slots 30 are formed in the side members 32 of the frame to allow clearance for the mill roller table rollers not shown . The bottom panels are mounted on cross bracing sub frames not shown which increase the stiffness of the frame 26. Also mounted on the cross bracing sub frames are longitudinal bumper or fender bars 34 projecting above the bottom panels to protect them from damage by the hot strip.he bars also help to guide the leading edge of the strip 2 om roller to roller, and when the arrangement is to form tart of the original equipment of a rolling mill installation the guidance offered by the bumper bars allows the roller vsble to be designed with the rollers to be spaced more widely apart than has hitherto been the practice so that there is a corresponding increase of the heat insulating ta el area. The side panels are protected by bumper or fender elements in the form of upwardly extending bolsters 36 fixed rigidly to the main frame 26. The spacing between the bolsters will be determined by the anticipated measure of sideways movement of the hot strip but generally two bolsters per side panel will be sufficient. In the design of the bolsters a compromise must be reached between mechanical strength and resistance to thermal stresses, as it will be appreciated that there will be large thermal gradients within them. To minimise the generation of thermal stresses a series of slots or grooves 38 can be formed in the exposed or hot face of each bolster to allow the hot face to expand s d contract relatively freely.Thermal stress relieving hooves not shown may also be used in the hot faces of the tovton bumper bars and the further bumper bars 40 that are provided for the top panels. Although sported through the rigid frame, the top panels 20 are mounted in a displaceable manner so that they can be lifted away from the roller table. Already mentioned this may be needed, for example, to prevent damage to the top panel if te hot strip lifts from the roller table but it is arranged that minor disturbances will not cause the top panels to lift and they are swung away from the roller table only if excessive upward forces occur on the bumper bars 40. nhus it has been found that the front end of a hot steel strip can often bounce from roller to roller as it is feeding though the roller table, and it will then strike the bumper bars as it bounces, but not with any very great f orce. It is therefore an advantage to ensure that the heat shield arrangement remains undisturbed by these relatively minor disturbances, although protective action is needed if excessively large upward forces occur. In the preferred arrangement shown, the top panel bumper bars 40 are mounted separately from the top panels 20 themselves, on a carrier frame 42 mounted on pivot blocks 44 on the main frame 26, the blocks defining a longitudinal pivot axis at the side of the roller table.Pairs of top panels are mounted each on a separate frame to that is also attached to the main frame and that surrounds the associated carrier frame 42. The panel mounting frames are pivoted on the same longitudinal axis as the carrier frames and are capable of relative rotation thereto to a liied extent. In the closed or operative position of the top panels, as shown by the foremost pair in Fig. 1, each bumper bar carrier frame 42 is held down with a positive holding force by displacement means in the form of fluid pressure rams 48 and bears on adjustable stops 49 mounted on that side of the frame 26 nearer the pivot axis. In the closed position the panel mounting frames are supported se rately from the carrier frames, each panel mounting frame having a side flange 50 that can then rest upon the fixed frame 26. The hold down force exerted by the rams 48 on the carrier frames will be chosen in dependence upon the type of material being rolled, its temperature, width and thickness. The arrangement is such that if the strip strikes the bars 40 with a force less than the selected level their carrier frame 42 remains in position, but if a higher force is experienced the carrier frame will lift against the pre loading force and activate a limit switch 51 to switch the pressure connections to the rams, so that the rams are extended and instead of holding down the bumper bars they lift the carrier frame LL2. As the carrier frame rises it engages with brackets 52 the associated panel mounting frame and the mounting frame, with the anels mounted on it, are then lifted together with the carrIer frame. Go ensure positive entrainment of the panel mounting frame by the carrier frame in the downward closing movement, particularly if they are arranged to move to near to or past a vertical position, brackets 53 secured to each carrier frame overlap a portion of its associated panel mounting frame. In the fully lowered position of each carrier frame, a specific clearance is provided between the brackets 52 and the associated panel mounting frame bg virtue of the independent support of the mounting frame on its side fBnge 50. In this way, while the carrier frame 42 remains in its lower position, the impact loads on its bumper bars are not trSnsmitted to the panels or their mounting frame due to the independent support arrangements of the carrier and support frames.The bumper bars 40 therefore act as part of an independent cushioning system until a preset lifting force is experienced, so protecting the panels until the disturbing force is so great that it displaces the bumper bars sufficiently to raise both carrier and mounting frames, and with them the panels. As an alternative or an addition to the limit switch already referred to for triggering movement of the bumper bar carrier frame, an inertia switch 51a may be attached to the frame to switch the rams when required. Since the inertia switch 51a will respond in dependence upon the magnitude of the upwards force applied to the bumper bar, before the bar has been displaced significantly by the force, this can provide a more rapid response. itig. 2 shows an example of the control circuit that may be employed to operate the rans in the manner already described. A pneumatic control circuit is shown but it will be appreciated that a corresponding hydraulic circuit could be employed for hydraulic rams or indeed an electrical drive and control arrangement could be similarly substituted. In the circuit shown, a compressed air supply 60 is fed through an electrically operated isolation valve 62, a filter 64, a zcisture trap 66, a pressure regulator 68 and a pilot ope rted diverter valve 70, to a manually controlled valve 72 having alternative open and closed positions, the oten position shown placing the circuit in its normal operating state. Pressure air can pass through the open manual valve 72 to a series of solenoid valves 74a, 74b, and 76a, 76b which control the air flows to and from the rams.When the solenoid valves are energised the rams are contracted to lower the top panels, but they are illustrated in their de energised state, so that pressure air is foe directly through lines 77 at full pressure to the underside of the ram pistons to extend the rams 48 from the contracted state shown and raise the panels rapidly while the ram cylinder s ces above the pistons are exhausted through lines 78 and the solenoid valves. When the solenoid valves are energised and switched to the opposite positions to those shown, if permitted by the state of pressure control valves 80, pressure air flows through the lines 78 to contract the rams. Flow control valves 82 in the lines 78 and the lines 77 to the underside of the ran pistons control the rate of contraction of the ams 48 and therefore limit the speed at which the panels are lowered. They operate only in this direction of flow and therefore do not limit the speed of movement of the rams when the panels are being raised.The pressure control valves 80 can be adjustably set, and by regulating the supply essure to the upper sides of the ram cylinders can determine the reload that the rams apply to the upper bar support frame. It will be understood from the foregoing description that the limit switch previously referred to controls the operation of the solenoid valves, so that actuation of the limit switch changes the valves over from a normally energised state. Spring loaded shuttle valves 86 are provided in the supply lines 77 to the undersides of the rams and are shown in their normally biased positions. If required in an emergency, the solenoid valves can be overridden by switching the manual valve 72 from the position shown. The main supply pressure is then applied to the shuttle valves to switch them over and allow the pressure air to flow directly to the undersides of the rams to lift the panels. In the event of loss of main supply pressure, the pilot operated valve 70 automatically reverses to isolate the mains supply line and to connect to the control circuit a back up supply such as from a compressed air bottle 88.This back up supply is fed through a further pilot operated valve 90 which remains operative only if the back up supply is pressurised. If the back up pressure falls the valve 90 closes and TATith both pilot operated valves then closed the control circuit is isolated. The control of the solenoid valves may be by means of electrical circuits from sequence switches mounted on a remote control panel not shown . Automatic override signals initiated by switches such as 51 and 51a on the panel bumper bars or their mountings, or from separate detector means such as a detector not shown mounted upstream of the heat shield arrangement that will be operated by bent or buckled stock entering the mill roller table, can cut off the electrical supply to the solenoid valves by means of cut out switches not shown that may be re set from the control panel. Additionally, if the manual override valve 72 is switched to raise the rams directly as already described, pressure air is then also fed to a switch 92 which in turn activates said cut out switches to isolate the electrical circuits and prevent remote control of the rams in this condition. Fig 1 shows the upper and lower panels at a uniform and relatively close vertical spacing, but this ay not be possible at the entry region of the heat shield arrangement. Fig. 3 shows a section through a continuous rolling mill in which the material being rolled passes continuously through roughing stands 102, along the roller table 104 to the finishing stands 106. In this process it is not uncommon for the nose end of the slab or strip S to acquire a turn up or set so that it is raised from the roller tablè,to such an extent that it would not be able to ester the small spacing between the series cf upper and lower panels 108,110.To overcome this problem and to ensure that quite large turn ups can be accommodated, the arrangement has,an entry region provided with guide means 112 that form an entry passage of increased height. As Fig. 4 shows in more detail, the guide means comprise a robust base frame 114 that is clamped to the side walls of the existing roller table or is fixed rigidly to the mill foundations. Vertical members 116 of the frame support a transverse pivot bar 118 to which the leading end of a nose entry guide member 120 is attached. The guide member can thus pivot with the bar 118 but it normally rests upon adjustable bottom stops 122 at its rear end. The guide ember takes the form of a reinforced frame or plate structure and includes a central spar 124 that extends under the main bumper bar of the first upper panel of the heat shield arrangement. In use, the guide member will normally remain in its illustrated position under tne combined action of its own weight and the hold down force that is being applied to the bumper bar. The enter sheet material, if above the height of the bl1mper bar, will strike the guide member and be urged downwards to below the level of the bumper bar.If the turn up or deformation of the enterinSmaterial is such as to be able to force te entry guide member upwards, this will also displace its acQoining bumper bar and, as previously described, if the force is sufficient the panel raising mechanism will be operated. On the other hand, since the entry member can be of a very robust construction it is possible to arrange that it oilers considerable resistance to displacement and thereby partially corrects any turn up of the entry material. In other types of rolling mill the above described entry guide means may not be sufficient. For example, in semi continuous mills the material is reduced from slab form by consecutive passes backwards and forward through reversing roughing stands. In this process there are considerably greater variations in turn up or lift of the material than in a continuous rolling process and a much greater entry height must be permitted. In that case, to employ entry guide means with little or no heat insulating effect, as shown in Fi 3 and 4, may ake it difficult or impossible to provide an effective heat shield arrangement and an arrangement such as is illustrated in Fig. 5 may be required. In this arrangement, an increased height entry section 130 continues over part of the extent of the heatinsulating panels themselves, and this may occupy up to some 409 of the length of the roller table 104. The guide means 112 itself is generally similar to that already described with reference to Fig. 4, but is of course disposed at a higher level. As before it co operates with the bumper bar associated with the leading upper panel 108a. Where it is necessary te have a substantial vertical spacing between the upper and lower insulating panels, a further difficulty may arise, as will now be explained with reference to Fig. 7, which shows in schematic form a part of a transverse cross section of a hot strip S as on a rolling mill delay table between mills, with heat shield panels 142, 144 above and below the strip respectively.In the central part of its width at portions such as P1 and P2 of the strip, most of the heat radiated from the hot strip will effectively go to heat up portions. of corresponding width of the heat shield panels. Some fall of temperature will result, to a similar extent for all such portions in the central region of the strip width. At the edges of the strip, however, conditions are no longer uniform. Because a large proportion of the energy radiated from a marginal portion such as the edge width P3 will fall on parts of the heat shield panels which are beyond the width of the strip, this marginal portion of the strip gives up more heat to the panels so that there will be a greater fall in the temperature of the strip at its lateral margins. This effect will be increased by heat loss to the sides between the top and bottom panels of the shield, where the energy radiated from the strip over an angle a will be directly lost. The direct radiation loss can be reduced by increasing the width of the shield relative to the strip, but then there is a greater energy loss from the hot strip to heat the marginal portions of the heat shields panels that w ll be particularly marked during start up. Fig. 8 illustrates one form of hot strip rolling mill arrangement according to the invention in which in addition to upper and lower heat insulating panels 142, 144 heat insulating side panels 146 are mounted at the outer edges of the upper and lower panels to form a heat shield surrounding the path of the hot strip . It will be clear from the preceding explanation with reference to Fig. 7 that blocking off direct leakage of radiant energy from the edges of the strip in this manner will be advantageous under steady state conditions, but the side panels will themselves act as a heat sink when cold and the situation may only be improved slightly during start up conditions. To overcome this problem, the side panels are provided with heating means 148, which may be either contained within the panels, immediately behind an inner cover plate as illustrated, or be mounted over the inward face of the panels. In general it will be found that electrical heating elements provide the most convenient method of giving te flexibility of operation that is required, but other forms of heating such as radiant tube gas or oil burners can be used. Although not shown in detail in the drawings, each of the heat insulating panels may comprise a thin walled casing containing a core of one or more layers of heat insulating material. Temperature sensors 150 are located at convenient intervals along the length of the side panels 146 to monitor the inner surface temperature and the sensor signals are utilised by a controller 52 and voltage regulator 154 to provide a stepped power input to the heating elements of side panels for controlling the surface temperature. In operation the apparatus may be controlled in the following manner. The desired side panel surface temperatures are first selected on the controller 152 and if the sensed values are below these teerstures the controller actuates the voltage regillator so that a controlled power supply is fed to the heating elements. Instead of relying on voltage regulation the control may operate by on off switching of the heating elements. An interlock arrangement 156 prevents the heating 0 the side panels being switched on unless the finished stands R of the mill are ready for production.Once steady state conditions are reached and the control system switches of the side panel heaters, the panels of course continue to uction as part of a passive heat shield arrangement. it will be understood that in particular installations it may be required to also have heating means associated with the upper and or lower panels and these may then be opereted in a similar manner. it will be clear that the provision of such side heating means can be of particular advantage in the heat shield arrangement shown in Fig. 5, where there is a considerable distance between the upper and lower panels in the entry region of the roller table. As indicated by Fig. 6, therefore, the heating weans as already described with reference to Fig. 8 can be e 1 oyed over the increased height entry region. It will be understood that the use of such side heating means can be employed elsewhere in heat shield arrangements according to the invention, and may even be provided along the complete length of the heat shield arrangement if required.
