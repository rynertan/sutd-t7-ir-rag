## Description
COMPONENTS FOR ASSEMBLING A FLOWER VASE The present invention relates to a vase for flowers and in particular to components for assembling such a vase1 It is common practice for bouquets of flowers to be sent to patients in hospltals and other institutions, and very often vases are not available to accommodate bouquets. Also, when flowers are being shown at flower shows, competitors have to transport vases for showing the flowers. Meny of these vases are large as well as being easily damaged. The present invention provides components for assembling a vase comprising a frame member adapted to be assembled to an erect condition to define a support for a water container, and an outer sleeve adapted to fit over the erected frame to secure the frame member in its erected condition. Advantageously, the components include a water container in the form of a bag, the bag being adapted to be located in the erected frame and havlng its open end between the frame and the sleeve1 Advantageously the frame member comprises a base to which are attached a plurality of side walls, and the outer sleeve comprises an equivalent number of complementary side walls, the frame member and outer sleeve being foldable from a substantially flat tondittion to an erect condition. Preferably, the vase when assembled has a base of greater cross sectional area than the mouth of the vase. An example of such a vase is a vase of a generally trunca ted pyramidal construction. The vase may be four sided and may also be provided with a square basle, Conveniently, the frame member comprises a pair of blanks, each blank comprising d base element and two side walls foldable from a flat condition to an erect condition, the two base elements being pivotally secured together so that said blanks may be In an overlying relatDnship when the vase is in the unassembled mode. Advantageously, the outer sleeve is provlded with fffiaps at its lower edge, said flaps being foldable to engage with the frame member. The flaps may be provided with an adhesive backing. The outer sleeve may also be provided with retaining means for a greetfng card. Conveniently the frame member and the outer sleeve are manufactured from card. Preferably, the components include a bag for use as a watertight membrane. The bag may be of a plastics material, such as polyethylene. If desired, a block of flower holding material such as urea formaldehyde foam, may be provided within the vase. The invention will hereinafter be described more particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example only. a preferred embodiment thereof. In the drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of a vase assembled from components according to the invention Flgure 2 is a perspective exploded vlew of the vase showing a frame member, bag and outer sleeve and Ftgure 3 is a plan view of the frame member in a flat condition. Referring to the drawings, the vase 10 comprises a frame member 12, a polyethylene bag 13 and an outer sleeve 14. The frame momber 12 comprises a pair of blanks 16, each of which has a base element 17 two side walls is and fold lines 19. The two blanks 16 are connected together by a rivet 21, to enable the blanks to be rotated from a position in which one lies upon the other, to the position in which the blanks lie generally at right angles to one another, as shown in Figure 3.From the cruciform position as shown, the four side walls 18 may be folded upwardly along the fold lines 19 to define a generally truncated pyramidal container. The outer sleeve 14 comprIses a single piece of material and has four side walls 22. The generally truncated pyramidal form is secured by means of the adhesive backed flap 23. Four adhesive backed flaps 25 are provided at the lower edge of the outer sleeve 14.When the outer sleeve 14 is positioned over the frame member 12 the adhesive flaps 25 are folded along the fold lines 26 and secured in position to the base 17 Of the frame member 12. The outer sleeve 14 is also provided with a slot 27 for accommodating a greetlng card. A vase is formed by erecting a frame member 12 as described, inserting into the frame member a polyethylene bag 13, the mouth of the bag being folded outwardly and over the sidle walls 18 of the frame member, then bringing the outer sleeve 14 downwardly over the frame member, so as to secure the bag in position, and finally securing the adhesive flaps 25 to the base of the frame member. It will be appreciated that the primary components of the vase, namely the frame member 12, the bag 13 and the outer sleeve 14 may be delivered to the potential user in a compact, flat conditton which can readily be erected when required. A block of flower holding material, such as urea formaldehyde foam, not shown. may be provided within the vase. This block further enhances the flexib111ty of the.vase in flower arranging. The vases, when assembled, may be placed on a vacuum formed tray also not shown . The trays provided with a plurality of wells each of which is adapted to support a vase. The under side of each tray is provided with a number of sponge pads which operate as non slip elements and a frame is provided about the rim of the tray to act as a reinforcement. The tray facilitates delivery of prepared flower arrangements to hospitals and other institutions.
