# SYSTEM FOR DIGITALLY CONTROLLING AN INDUCTION MOTOR.

## Abstract
A system for digitally controlling an induction motor, which corrects the difference between the real speed of the induction motor and a specified speed in such a manner that the real speed follows the specified speed, and which has a current negative feedback loop. The system comprises means 9 for obtaining an exciting current from the real speed of the induction motor and a torque instruction of the difference means 10 for obtaining a secondary current which is a load current from the torque instruction of the difference means 12 for obtaining a primary current am plification and a current phase based upon the exciting cur rent and the secondary current means 11 for obtaining a slip frequency from the real speed and the torque instruction means 13 for obtaining an exciting phase of the rotational magnetic field from the slip frequency and the real speed means 15 for obtaining a current instruction of each of the phases relying upon the amplitude of the primary current and the current phase means 16 21 for obtaining voltage instructions relying upon current deviation between the cur rent instruction of each of the phases and the feedback cur rent from the current negative feedback loop means 29 for generating an electromotive force for correcting a counter electromotive force based upon the exciting current and means 22 24 for superposing the electromotive force on said voltage instruction to correct the counterelectromotive force based upon said exciting current. In a range on the upper side of the ground speed, the counterelectromotive force of the induction motor is maintained constant by signals formed by outputs from a means 9 which obtains an ex citing current from the real speed of the induction motor and a torque instruction of the difference, from means 11 which obtains a slip frequency from the real speed and the torque instruction, and from means 29 which generates an elec tromotive force for correcting the counterelectromotive force based upon the exciting current.
