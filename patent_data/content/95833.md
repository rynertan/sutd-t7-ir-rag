# METHOD OF PREVENTING INFECTION BY VIROPEXIS PENETRATING VIRUSES

## Abstract
The class of weakly basic molecules which are at least partially soluble in water, and which are at neutral pH 7 to 7.5 partially or totally under basic form, electrically neutral, gaseous or liposoluble, and which have a pKa greater than the lysosomal pH 5 to 5.5 and which are neither virucidal nor generally cytotoxic provide an important new class of antiviral agents which are capable of inhibiting the pene tration of viropexis penetrating viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus VSV , into the cytoplasmic matrix of target cells which are contacted with the anti viral agent, prefer ably before the cell is contacted with the virus. These anti viral agents do not have any anti viral effect on fusion pene trating viruses and, therefore, these anti viral agents pro vide a valuable tool for screening viruses by their cell pen etrating mechanisms as well as for their own potential ther apeutic value.
