# Improvements in drilling equipment.

## Abstract
A drill string for drilling deep wells is provided with a device 16 for providing a pulsating flow of the pressurized drilling fluid to the jets of the drill bit 20 to enhance chip removal and provide a vibrating action in the drill bit 20 itself thereby to provide a more efficient and effective drilling operation. The device 16 includes a rotating valve 56 on a rotor 36 driven by turbines 52 rotated with respect to a stator 34 by the drilling fluid as it passes through the device 16 on its way to the drill bit 20 . The pressure pulses thus generated rise to peaks in excess of the mean pump pressure without requiring an increased pumping capacity.
