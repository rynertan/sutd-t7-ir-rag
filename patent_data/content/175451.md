# Flexible multiple layer packaging film and packages made from such film.

## Abstract
A flexible polymeric multilayer packaging film permits an easy opening package to be produced by heat sealing two layers of film together. The film has at least five layers, namely a heat sealable layer 712 , a central gas barrier layer 716 and a moisture resistant layer 720 , plus two adhesive layers 714,718 respectively located between the heat seala ble layer and the central layer, and between the latter and the olefinic layer. The package is formed with a heat seal between two confronting heat sealable layers 712 , the seal having such strength that the layers 712 are effectively inseparable. If the two layers of film are subjected to oppositely directed pulls arrowed , ply separation occurs at an interface between layers other than the heat sealable layers 712 , following a partial tearing of the film. As shown, tearing is through a heat sealable layer 712 and the associated adhesive layer 714 adjacent the heat seal and ply separation occurs between the latter layer 714 and the central layer 716 and propagates through the area of the seal to open the package.
