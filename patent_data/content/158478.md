## Description
This invention relates to a methacrylic resin molding material and to a method for the production thereof, and more particularly to a methacrylic resin molding material for the manufacture of a cross linked shaped article and to a method for the production thereof. Description of Prior Art Generally, the methacrylic resin formed preponderantly of methyl methacrylate enjoys excellent weatherability and outstanding transparency and, because of this salience, finds utility in applications to covers for lamps, parts for automobiles, signboards, ornamental articles and sundry goods. Since the aforementioned methacrylic resin is a linear polymer, however, it has some disadvantages that it is deficient in resistance to heat, resistance to solvents, resistance to shocks, and surface hardness. Regarding the resistance to heat, for example, the methacrylic resin withstands heat up to about 100 C at most and, therefore, falls short of satisfying the needs arising from various applications for which resistance to heat is a requisite. In the case of parts for automobiles, the methacrylic resin cannot be used in covers for head lamps. In the case of tail lamps, since the volume of heat generated is growing because of increase in lamp size and increase in illuminance and the wall thickness of cover is decreasing to permit desired cost cut, the necessity of the covers of the lamps acquiring improved heat resistance is finding approval. The methacrylic resin is expected to find growing utility in applications to parts such as covers for meters on automobiles and two wheelers motorcycles and covers for water heaters using solar energy which by nature experience great elevation of temperature under direct exposure to the sunlight. Thus, the development of a methacrylic resin composition capable of withstanding heat above the boiling point of water is longed for. For the purpose of conferring improved heat resistance upon the methacrylic resin, there have been proposed numerous methods, e.g. a method resorting to copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with α methyl styrene U.S. Patent No. 3,135,723 , a method resorting to copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with α methyl styrene and maleic anhydride Japanese Patent Publication Nos. SHO 45 1970 31,953 and SHO 49 1974 10,156 , and a method resorting to copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with α methyl styrene and maleimide Japanese Patent Laid Open No. SHO 48 1973 95,490 . Indeed these methods are invariably capable of improving the methacrylic resin in heat resistance. Some of them, however, suffer from notably slow rate of polymerization or insufficient increase of conversion and, consequently, fail to obtain high conversion. Others, though capable of efficiently producing polymers rather quickly, suffer their products to assume color heavily and acquire transparency, weatherability, surface hardness and mechanical strength at levels lower than normally tolerated. Combining both merits and demerits, the conventional methods fall far short of being commercially feasible and have not been reduced to practice. It is generally conceivable that introduction of a cross linked configuration enables a polymer to acquire enhanced resistance to heat and to solvents. Since a cross linked polymer has already formed a three dimensional structure, it no longer can be molded by injection molding, extrusion molding or transfer molding. When the cross linked polymer is molded by cast molding, it is liable to give rise to voids and bubbles. Thus, the cast molding of this cross linked polymer fails to produce molded articles of complicate shape and suffers from inferior productivity. Kodama et al., in their report inserted in Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 27, No. 297, p. 65, offer a statement, reading As one approach to the improvement of moldability of the cross linked polymer, a method which comprises selecting a monomer having functional groups separated by a long distance from each other, setting this monomer polymerizing and terminating the first stage of polymerization while a fairly large proportion of the monomer still remains unaltered above 90 of conversion , molding the first stage polymer in a given shape, and thereafter performing the second stage polymerization of the molded polymer until completion of the polymerization is conceivable. Despite this suggestion, they offer no working example of this method. In our repetition of the method described by Kodama et al., when the product of the first stage polymerization was compression molded at elevated temperature in a metal die, the sample solidified and failed to flow and finally converted into a powder, this showing absolutely no moldability. The term molding as used by Kodama et al. in the aforementioned statement means a very simple process of bending. It is not essentially synonymous with the molding process involving fluidity as aimed at by this invention. An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a novel methacrylic resin molding material and a method for the production thereof. Another object of this invention is to provide a methacrylic resin molding material for manufacture of cross linked molded articles and a method for the production of the resin material. A further object of this invention is to provide a methacrylic resin molding material for manufacture of cross linked molded articles excelling in physical properties such as heat resistance and resistance to solvents without any sacrifice of transparency and a method for the production of the molding material. Still another object of this invention is to provide a methacrylic resin moulding material of excellent storability for manufacture of cross linked moulded articles excelling in physical properties such as heat resistance and resistance to solvents without any sacrifice of transparency and a method for easy production of the moulding material. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for the production of a methacrylic resin moulding material formed of a partially cross linked polymer gel, which comprises partially polymerising a mixture comprising a resin raw material A , and a cross linking monomer B in the presence of a polymerisation initiator the resin raw material A consisting of one or more monomeric C₁ C₄ alkyl methacrylates, and or an α, β ethylenically unsaturated monomer mixture formed preponderantly in terms of moles of C₁ C₄ alkyl methacrylates, and or a syrup containing at least one of these monomers, C₁ C₄ alkyl methacrylate being preponderant in terms of moles, and at least one of their polymers the cross linking monomer B being present as 4 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin raw material A allowing the polymer content of the resultant polymer gel to be increased by 4 62 by weight over the polymer content of the mixture and preventing the total polymer content from exceeding an upper limit of 62 by weight. The invention also extends to a methacrylic resin moulding material made by such a method. The invention also extends to a method of preparing a shaped article by moulding such a moulding material. The various aspects of the invention referred to above may include, individually or collectively, anyone or any combination of the following features The monomers usable as the resin raw material A in the present invention include alkyl methacrylates in their unadulterated form and mixtures of such alkyl methacrylates with α,β ethylenically unsaturated monomers copolmerizable therewith. In the case of such monomer mixtures, the alkyl methacrylate content is desired to exceed 50 mol , preferably to exceed 60 mol . Examples of the alkyl methacrylate include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, n propyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, n butyl methacrylate, sec butyl methacrylate and tert butyl methacrylate. Among other alkyl methacrylates, methyl methacrylate proves particularly desirable. Examples of the copolymerizable monomer include alkyl methacrylates as such alkyl methacrylates 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate and cyclohexyl methacrylate other than alkyl methacrylate used as the main component methyl methacrylate, for example , alkyl acrylates such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and lauryl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, hydroxy alkyl acrylates such as 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate and 2 hydroxy 3 chloropropyl acrylate, hydroxyalkyl mehacrylates such as 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl methacrylate and 2 hydroxy 3 chloropropyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylates such as neodymium acrylate, lead acrylate, and boron acrylate, methacrylates such as neodymium methacrylate, lead methacrylate, and boron methacrylate, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide, styrene, α methyl styrene, vinyl toluene and maleic anhydride. The syrup containing the polymer of the alkyl methacrylate or of the monomer mixture formed preponderantly of alkyl methacrylate is generally a monomer solution having viscosity in the range of 1 to 1000 poises at 25 C and containing the polymer in a concentration in the range of 3 to 40 by weihgt, preferably in the range of 6 to 20 by weight. The cross linking agent B to be used in the present invention is a monomer containing at least two meth acryloyl groups in the molecular unit thereof and having not more than 10 atoms along the main chain interposed between any two of meth acryloyl groups, preferably a monomer represented by any of the following three general formulas wherein R₁ denotes H, CH₃, C₂H₅ or CH₂OH R₂ denotes H, CH₃, where R₄ denotes H or CH₃ or CH₂OH R₃ denotes H or CH₃ R₁, R₂ and R₃ do not denote a hydrogen atom all at the same time and M A denotes a methacryloyl group or an acryloyl group, wherein n denotes either 1 or 2. Typical examples of the monomer include 1,3 propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4 butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate, 1,3 butylene glycol dimethacrylate, dimethylol ethane dimethacrylate, 1,1 dimethylol propane dimethacrylate, 2,2 dimethylol propane dimethacrylate, trimethylol ethane tri meth acrylate, trimethylol propane tri meth acrylate, tetramethylol methane tri meth acrylate, tetramethylol methane dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol di meth acrylate and diethylene glycol di meth acrylate. The amount of the cross linking agent B to be used is in the range of 4 to 150 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin raw material A . If this amount is less than 2 parts by weight, the molded article finally produced fails to show any discernible improvement in heat resistance. If this amount exceeds 250 parts by weight, the finally obtained molded article is too brittle to withstand impacts experienced during actual use. The methacrylic resin molding material according to this invention is a gel partial polymer which is obtained by heating the mixture of the resin raw material A and the cross linking agent B in the presence of a polymerization initiator thereby setting the mixture polymerizing and terminating the polymerization while the whole amount of the monomers present in the mixture is not completely polymerized and part thereof still remains unaltered. In this case, the content of polymer present in the methacrylic resin molding material which is the gel partial polymer is required to be such as to exceed the polymer content of the mixture of A the resin raw material selected from the group consisting of alkyl methacrylate monomers, α,β ethylenically unsaturated monomer mixtures formed preponderantly of alkyl methacrylates, and partial polymers thereof and B a cross linking agent by 4 to 62 by weight, more desirably by 10 to 62 by weight, and most desirably by 20 to 62 by weight, though invariably not to exceed the upper limit of 62 by weight. If the polymer content increased as mentioned above is less than 4 by weight, the product of the partial polymerization fails to acquire the form of gel and does not permit easy handling. If the polymer content exceeds the polymer content of the aforementioned mixture by more than 62 by weight, the produced molding material fails to exhibit satisfactory fluidity during the molding work. Thus, any deviation of the polymer content from the aforementioned range results in failure to fulfil the objects of this invention. The polymer content of the partial polymer can be determined by the extraction method. As the polymerization initiator, various substances are available for the polymerization contemplated by this invention. When a polymerization initiator active at low temperatures and a polymerization initiator active at elevated temperatures are used as combined, the reaction for the formation of the gel partial polymer can be effected by the action of the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures and, during the subsequent course for the molding of the gel molding material in a desired shaped article by application of heat, the final polymerization can be effected by the action of the polymerizaion initiator active at elevated temperatures. It is naturally permissible to use only either of the polymerizaiton initiator active at elevated temperatures and the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures. As the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures, it is advantageous to use a radical polymerization initiator formed of a peroxide and an azo compound of which the decomposition temperature for obtaining a half life of ten hours, for example, is not more than 50 C. With a view to enhancing the storability of the molding material, the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures is desired to be eliminated as thoroughly as permissible during the polymerization for the production of the molding material. In the respect, the decomposition temperature is desired to fall in the range of 26 to 45 C, preferably 26 to 41 C. The amount of the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures to be used in this case is required to fall in the range of 0.002 to 1 by weight, preferably 0.005 to 0.1 by weight, based on the total weight of the resin raw material of A and the cross linking agent of B . Examples of the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures so used in the present invention as described above include I acetyl cyclohexylsulfonyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, cumyl peroxy neodecanoate, diisopropyl peroxy dicarbonate, di n propyl peroxy dicarbonate, dimyristyl peroxy dicarbonate, diallyl peroxydicarbonate and 2,2 azobis 4methoxy 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile , II di 2 ethoxyethyl peroxy dicarbonate, di methoxyisopropyl peroxy dicarbonate and di 2 ethylhexyl peroxy dicarbonate, and III di 3 methyl 3 methoxybutyl peroxy dicarbonate, t butyl peroxy neodecanoate and 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile . In all the compounds of the three groups enumerated above, those of the groups I and II are more desirable and those of the group I are most desirable. As the polymerization initiator active at elevated temperatures it is advantageous to use a polymerization initiator of a peroxide having decomposition temperature in the range of 60 to 220 C. For the purpose of improving the molding cycle and ensuring high storability, the decomposition temperature of this polymerization initiator is desired to fall in the range of 90 to 170 C, preferably 120 to 170 C. The amount of the polymerization initiator active at elevated temperatures to be used in this invention is required to fall in the range of 0.02 to 2.0 by weight, preferably 0.05 to 2.0 by weight, based on the total weight of the resin raw material of A and the cross linking agent of B . Examples of the polymerization initiator active at elevated temperatures include IV t butylcumyl peroxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, di t butyl peroxide, p menthane hydroperoxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexyl 3,1,1,3,3 tetramethylbutyl hydroperoxide, 2,5 dimethylhexane 2,5 dihydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t butylhydroperoxide and 1,2,2,2 tetraphenyl 1,2 ethane diol, V 1,1 bis t butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane, 1,1 bis t butylperoxy cyclohexane, t butyl peroxymaleic acid, t butyl peroxylaurate, t butylperoxy 3,5,5 trimethylhexanoate, cyclohexanone peroxide, t butyl peroxyisopropyl carbonate, 2,5 dimethyl,2,5 di benzoylperoxy hexane, 2,2 bis t butylperoxy octane, t butyl peroxyacetate 2,2 bis t butylperoxy butane, t butylperoxy benzoate, n butyl 4,4 bis t butylperoxy valerate, di t butyl diperoxy isophthalate, methylethyl ketone peroxide, , bis t butylperoxyisopropyl benzene, dicumyl peroxide, and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane, VI t butyl hydroperoxide, m toluoyl peroxide, t butyl peroxy isobutyrate, 2,3 dimethyl 2,3 diphenyl butane, octanoyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, stearoyl peroxide, propionyl peroxide, succinic acid peroxide, acetyl peroxide and 1,1 azobis cyclohexane 1 carbonitrile . In the compounds of the three groups enumerated above, those of the groups IV and V are more desirable and those of the group IV are particularly desirable. As described above, the methacrylic resin molding material of the present invention is produced by heating the mixture of the resin raw material of A and the cross linking agent of B in the presence of the polymerization initiator thereby setting the mixture polymerizing. This polymerization reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 10 to 80 C, preferably 35 to 65 C, for a period of 10 to 200 minutes, preferably 20 to 150 minutes. When the two polymerization initiators, one active at low temperatures and the other active at elevated temperatures are used as combined, the former polymerization initiator is substantially consumed and the latter polymerization initiator remains almost unchanged because of its incapability of decomposition at the reaction temperature. The latter polymerization initiator so surviving the reaction is consumed during the subsequent course of molding of the resultant molding in the prescribed shape. In accordance with the present invention, when the polymerization reaction is stopped as by sudden cooling of the reaction system, there is obtained the gel partial polymer of desired conversion. Further in accordance with the present invention, the methacrylic resin molding material which is the gel partial polymer can be easily obtained in a desired conversion by adding a specific regulating agent in a specific amount during thermal polymerization of the mixture of the resin raw material A and the crosslinking agent B in the presence of the polymerization initiator. Examples of the specific regulating agent usable for this purpose include 1,4 8 p menthadiene, 2,6 dimethyl,2,4,6 octatriene, 1,4 p menthadiene, 1,4 cyclohexadiene and α methyl styrene dimer. The regulating agent is added in an amount falling in the range of 0.0001 to 0.5 by weight, more desirably 0.001 to 0.2 by weight, and most desirably 0.005 to 0.1 by weight, based on the total amount of the aforementioned resin raw material A and the cross linking agent B . If the amount of the regulating agent so added is less than 0.0001 by weight, then the effect of the addition of the regulating agent is not manifested. If this amount exceeds 0.5 by weight, the polymerization is retarded too much to proceed to a desired conversion. By the method of this invention, the desired conversion is attainable by selecting adequately the amount of the regulating agent, the amount of the radical polymerization initiator active at low temperatures, and the temperature of polymerization. For example, as the amount of the polymerization initiator active at low temperatures is decreased, the rate of polymerization is notably slowed at a low conversion. The rate of polymerization is slowed at a low conversion and the time required for the polymerization to reach the desired conversion is prolonged in proportion as the amount of the regulating agent is increased. In accordance with the method of this invention, the gel partial polymer can be obtained at a desired conversion by suddenly cooling the polymerization system while in progress and thereby stopping the polymerization reaction or by controlling the amount of the polymerization initiator thereby slowing the rate of polymerization velocity in the desired conversion range. By the second method of this invention using a regulating agent, the gel partial polymer can be obtained at a desired conversion with high reproducibility by a simpler procedure. This method also permit the gel partial polymer to be obtained with improved storability. Optionally, the mixture prepared as the raw material for the partial cross linking polymerization aimed at the production of the gel partial polymer may incorporate various additives such as chain transfer agent, coloring agent, and filler and other resin as well. Examples of the chain transfer agent include n alkyl and t alkyl mercaptans having 11 or 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group thereof, thio glycolic acid, and thio glycolic alkyl esters having 11 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl group thereof. As the coloring agent, any of the conventional dyes and pigments can be used. Examples of the filler include glass fibers, calcium carbonate, silica, aluminum hydroxide, glanular carbon, carbon fibers, mica flakes, calcium phosphate, barium sulfate, magnesium oxide and tin oxide. The methacrylic type molding material according to this invention is not sticky and possesses shape retaining property and, therefore, can be conveniently handled in any desired form such as, for example, sheet, rod, block, flakes and pellets. By the application of shear stress at normal room temperature or at elevated temperatures, the molding material is enabled to flow. Thus, it can be molded even in the complicated shape not attainable by the cast polymerization. The methacrylic resin molding material according to present invention can be molded to produce a molded article of a desired shape by the compression molding, extrusion molding injection molding, or transfer molding method, for example, performed at a temperature in the range of 90 to 180 C, preferable 100 to 150 C, for a period of 1 to 30 minutes, preferably 3 to 15 minutes. For the sake of convenience on molding, kneading may be conducted prior to molding or fillers or other additives may be incorporated, if necessary. Now, the present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to working examples. In the working examples cited below, the polymer content in the partial polymer was determined by the following procedure. In a constant temperature water bath kept at 50 C, a Soxhlet extractor containing 150 ml of dichloromethane having 1,000 ppm of hydroquinone monomethyl ether dissolved therein and holding a 15 g strip of given gel partial polymer inserted in a tubular filter paper for extraction is left standing for 20 hours to effect reflux extraction. At the end of the extraction, the extract is placed in 1,200 ml of methanol to separate the polymer component. The polymer so separated and the polymer retained in the tubular filter paper are combined and dried under a vacuum at 55 C until a constant weight. The polymer so obtained is weighed. The following abbreviations are used in the working examples. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.

The gel partial polymer was found to have a polymer content of 31.7 . In a metal die designed, to produce a pen tray measuring 69 x 208 mm² in top area, 54 x 194 mm² in bottom area, 18 mm in depth, and 2.5 mm in wall thickness, 70 g of the gel partial polymer was press molded.
