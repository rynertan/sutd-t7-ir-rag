## Abstract
There is disclosed a cutting means magazine 10 for a sterile docking device for forrning a connection between two thermoplastic tubes comprising a casing 8 , a stack 22 of disposable cutting means 23 therein, and spring means urging the stack 22 against a wall of the casing 8 . The casing 8 has an exit slot 20 for ejection of the uppermost cutting means and a slot 17 for an ejector, the latter slot 17 having upstream and downstream access openings 18, 19 . The upstream access opening 18 a has an ejector aligning surface 7 with a rise of at least about 0.25 mm and a slope of up to 45 and b being from about 50 100 of the cutting means thickness. The downstream access opening 19 is from about 10 80 greater than the cutting means thickness.
