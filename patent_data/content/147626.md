# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING BIPOLAR AND MOS TRANSISTORS, AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a bipolar transistor 48, 152 formed in a monocrystalline silicon region 6 which is epitaxially grown from a silicon substrate 1, 41 , and an MOS transistor 47, 154, 156 formed in each of silicon regions 22 , 23 which are epitaxially grown on an insulating layer 2, 3 provided on the silicon substrate. The silicon regions on the insulating layer are treated as follows. When one principal surface of the silicon substrate, that is, the principal surface including the monocrystalline silicon region 6 and the silicon regions 22 , 23 is heated from the outside, heat produced in the monocrystalline silicon region 6 is rapidly conducted to the silicon substrate, but heat produced in the silicon regions 22 , 23 is hard to dissipate. That is, the silicon regions on the insulating layer are melted and then recrystallized. Thus, the silicon regions can be transformed into approximately monocrystalline layers, on each of which the MOS transistor is formed. Further, a vertical power transistor can be formed by providing the collector electrode of the bipolar transistor on the other principal surface of the silicon substrate.
