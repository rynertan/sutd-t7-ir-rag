# Process for preparing polyarylates in two steps.

## Abstract
Described herein is a process for preparing crystalline polyarylates which comprises a forming a crystalline polyarylate prepolymer having a reduced viscosity of from 0.05 to about 0.4 dl g by reacting at least one diester deriva tive of a dihydric phenol with at least one aromatic dicarbox ylic acid in the presence of a solvent, at a temperature of from about 250 to about 300 C, and b heating the prepolymer so formed below its melting point to form a crystalline polyary late having a reduced ivcosity of from about 0.45 to about 1.2 dl g.
