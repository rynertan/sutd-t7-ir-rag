# Bulk material container with a door movable over a rectilinear path.

## Abstract
A bulk material container with an opening has a door arranged to move over a rectilinear path for the opening and the closing of the opening. For moving the door over a rectilinear path to either open or close the opening, a threaded shaft is journalled for rotation within the container and is aligned axially with the center of the door. Means on the threaded shaft engage the door so that the door is moved over the rectilinear path by the rotation of the threaded shaft. A gasket surrounds the opening at the time of closure by the door. Continued rotation of the shaft for the closure of the door will cause the gasket to be compressed against the plate surrounding the opening. Rotation of the door is inhibited while the gasket is being compressed.
