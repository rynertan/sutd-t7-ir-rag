## Description
This invention relates to a frothable thermosetting polyurethane composition, a process for producing a curable froth from said composition, a process for applying the curable froth to a substrate and a cured cellular polyurethane produced from the curable froth. There are a number of processes known in the art for the manufacture of polyurethane foam. One process of manufacture involves mechanical froth foaming.Another method uses a chemical blowing agent.Still another method of foam manufacture is dependent upon CO2 gas being emitted from the reaction of isocyanate and water to effect blowing. Heretofore, all chemical procedures which have been employed in the manufacture of polyurethane foam have involved expansion of the chemical mixture which contains a curable polyurethane. This expansion is a product of the reaction of isocyanate with moisture causing CO2 to be generated which foams the resin. Alternatively, expansion occurs by using a volatile blowing agent which expands the urethane into a cellular structure. In the typical case of manufacture of polyurethane foam, one or more of the aforementioned techniques are employed. In almost all instances some expansion occurs as a result of blowing the foam by virtue of COo generation.This occurs because during the foaming operation, there is enough residual moisture either in the foam or present in the atmosphere to cause reaction of water with free isocyanate which generates the production of at least some CO. The production of CO2 results in an expanded surface which is difficult to control in terms of foam thickness. For example, if one wishes to produce a sheet of urethane foam having a uniform thickness, it is necessary to utilize at least two surfaces within which to introduce the foamable composition and which confine the degree of expansion of the polyurethane foam on curing.Removal of one of the surfaces from the cured foam will leave behind a relatively uniform sheet of polyurethane foam in which the surface which receives the expanded foam has a skin which is thicker than any of the walls of the cells in the interior of the foam. Therefore, in producing a polyurethane foam from an expanding mass of materials, the thickness of the cured foam is difficult to control and if confinement by a mold is employed to control that thickness, at least one of the surfaces of the cured foam will have a thick skin thereon. Thus, any cured foam heretofore made by a chemical process would have a surface skin, the interior calls would be essentially flat and or the product would possess an uneven surface. Froth foam is a well developed technology.Polyurethane foaming froths have extensive utility for foam backing for carpeting and fabrics. These froths can contain a polyurethane polymer and an organosilicon surfactant. For example, U.S. Patent 3,772,224 describes a process for the production of a polyurethane foam from a heat curable froth. Inert gas is incorporated into the liquid phase of a polyurethane polymer and surfactant, to provide a froth having a density, at ambient atmospheric pressure, of less than about 45 percent of the density of the liquid phase prior to frothing. The froth is cured attempentures above 700C to form a cured polyurethane foam. This patent describes that a catalyst may be used to cure the mixture and the catalyst should have substantial activity in curing the mixture above 700C. .. Additionally, the patent states that there is substantially no chemical expansion and that only thermal expansion takes place during heat curing. However, one feature of the process which is not often given consideration is the fact that the foaming process is carried out in the presence of a moisture laden atmosphere. The moisture from the atmosphere can enter the foam. As a result, this water reacts with the isocyanate generating urea linkages , and liberating CO2, which causes expansion of the froth foam, evep. though such expansion is not designed into the formulation. As a result, a relatively non uniform urethane foam is obtained, but it is more uniform in thickness than would be obtained by employing a chemical blowing agent. However, even though this expansion is acceptable for carpet backing purposes, such a foam is not necessarily acceptable for many other purposes.The inability to control the thickness of the froth foam on cure is a serious problem in those areas of use in which one is attempting to place the foam into a cavity and control the surface thereof such that it creates a monolithic appearing surface. Moreover in the mixtures shown in U.S. Patent 3,772,224, the cured foam density is invariably lower than the uncured froth density. This is a result of both thermal expansion due to elevated temperature cure, and to post expansion caused by small amounts of entrained water reacting with the isocyanate. In the present invention, curing takes place at ambient temperature which precludes thermal expansion and with an essentially moisture free froth which minimizes CO2 formulation and the resultant post expansion. Thermosetting polyurethane resins are crosslinked materials. As previously discussed, in the manufacture of polyurethane foams they can cross link and expand. The product is expanded upon cure through the action of a chemical blowing agent, or by having the isocyanate react with water whereby carbon dioxide is generated which forces expansion of the polyurethane upon cure. In the technique of forming a froth foam, air is whipped into a polyurethane forming composition. One would expect that such a froth polyurethane foam would actually shrink upon curing due to the natural shrinkage which occurs as the result of cross linking. Actually, the froth polyurethane foam expands because moisture present reacts with isocyanate present and the two result in the formation of a urea bond and the generation of carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas plays the same role as the chemical blowing agent in that it causes the polyurethane to expand rather than contract4 The degree of expansion of such a froth polyurethane foam is obviously dependent upon the amount of free isocyanate and the amount of available water.In most cases, there is enough water present to effect a substantial degree of reaction with isocyanate and significant amount of expansion in the cured product. This expansion, as pointed out above, creates a limitation on the utility of the resulting cured product. One limitation that it imposes is that it is difficult to control the eventual density of the foam. Secondly, there is considerable difficulty in controlling the uniformity of thickness of the resulting cured foam. Last, but not least, there is considerable difficulty in controlling the surface smoothness of the skin of the unrestrained portion of the foam during the curing cycle. Thus, a froth foam mixture poured into a container and allowed to cure will undergo a significant amount of expansion. U.S. Patent 3,821130 describes flexible polyurethane foams prepared from inert gas frothed mixtures of a polyether polyol end capped with at least 2 moles of ethylene oxide per active hydrogen atom, a polyisocyanate containing material and a catalyst for urethane formation. The polyether polyol and polyisocyanate are employed in quantities so as to provide an NCO OH ratio of from about 0.85 1 to about 2.0 1. The flexible polyurethane foams produced have densities below about 15 lbs. 3 ft. This patent states that the foams do not require the use of a volatilizing blowing or foaming agent or a silicone oil cell control agent. The foams of the patent are prepared by mechanically inducing the inert gas into the urethane forming composition producing a froth which is or can be dispensed into a suitable mold or onto a suitable substrate whereupon the frothed mixture sets into a cellular polyurethane product. The patent states that the conventional froth resulting from the mechanical introduction of inert gas into the urethane forming mixture does not undergo any subsequent significant expansion other than that caused by any thermal expansion of the inert gas employed which is very small, i.e., less than about 1 percent by volume. The patent, in column 3, describes the various methods of preparing the froth. These methods include mechanically whipping or blending air or other inert gases into the mixture of urethane forming components with a mixer fitted with a blade designed to mechanically whip the air into said mixture. Another method comprises feeding a stream composed of a mixture of the urethane forming components or separate streams of the urethane forming components and a stream of air into a froth generator mixer where the frothed composition which emerges from the mixer is directed into a mold or onto a substrate where the frothed composition thermosets into a flexible polyurethane foam.Still another method described in the patent is to feed the inert gas and all of the urethane forming components, except for the catalyst, into the froth generator mixer and subsequently mix the catalyst with the resultant froth in a mixer, such as a static mia r, and then direct the froth into a mold or onto a subs rate. In Examples 1 to 130f the patent, the polyether olyol and isocyanate containing compound are placed into ç Hobart mixer equipped with a blade for whipping air intt the mixture and whipping at a high rate of speed for a . me sufficient to provide a froth, usually two minutes. After the whipping is complete, a catalyst is added and the resulting froth mixed for an ndditional 45 seconds and then poured into an open container to cure. The patent states that it may be desireable in some instance to use about 1 to 20 parts by weight per hundred parts of the active hydrogen containing component of a blowing agent such as a volatile liquid or from about 0.1 to about 5 parts by weight of water. Use of such slowing agents is inconsistent xvit , tne desire to minimize postfoam which is the object of the present invention. The frothed compositions produced in the patent are stated to be suitable for application to carpets, paper, and natural textile fabrics. However, upon revealing the procedure to pro duce a froth, and the resulting cured polyurethane, accord ing to that described in U.S. Patent 3,821,130, specif ically, Example 9 therein , it was found that the froth postfoamed upon curing See Comparative Example A, infra .This is contrary to the following statement in column 2 of the patent The conventional froth resulting from the mechanical inducing of inert gas into the urethane forming mixture does not undergo any subsequent significant expansion other than that caused by any thermal expansion of the inert gas employed which is very small, i.e., less than 1 percent by volume . In many applications postfoaming is determined where the frothed composition is applied, for example, to the joint formed when two wall boards, are placed in abutting relationship to one another. Any postfoaning in such an application will not provide for a monolithicappear ing wall. Another important embodiment of the instant invention is that the size of the cells which form the surface of the polyurethane foam, have a dimension which is essentially equivalent to the size of the cell in the mid interior of the polyurethane foam. This means that from surface to surface, the size of the cells of the polyurethane foam, exclusive of those cells which are adhesively bonded to a substrate and are contiguous thereto, are essentially uniform. Such uniformity is reflective of the average uniformity that one would find in the mid section of such a polyurethane foam. British Patent 1,333,088 describes a process for producing a cellular polyurethane by mixing an inert gas with a liquid polyurethane intermediate composition containing a surfactant, whipping the intermediate polymer composition to form a stable froth and subsequently mixing into the froth a curative for the polyurethane intermediate polymer by static mixing means. Specifically, the examples of this patent show the formation of a prepolymer by reacting a diol and an isocyanate. A silicone surfactant is then added. The prepolymer composition is then pumped to the head of an Oakes mixer where air is beaten into the composit ion at a particular rate. The back pressure in the head is adjusted to 651bs. i 2andthe froth fed through a flexible pipe 30 ft. in length to a static mixer.The frothed prepolymer stream meets with a stream of the liquid curative. The curative is described as a polyfunctional amine or alcbhol. When a polyfunctional alcohol curative is used,a conventional polyurethane catalyst, such as a metal salt, i.e., stannous, stannic or lead salt, or an amine is employed with the curative. The materiel emerging from the mixer is poured into molds and cured at temperatures cf from 60 75 C. The cellular polyurethane formed is described as preferably having a closed cell structure with a density substantially not less than half the density of the solid polyurethane. The cellular polyurethanes are rigid and are stated to be useful as substitutes for solid rubber compositions such as in shoe soles. However, the foamatle composition,as well as the resultant cellular polyurethane formed in the British patent, are completely different from the foamable composition and the cellular product formed in this invention. An important component of the foamable composition of the instant invention is a thixotrope. The british patent does not describe the use of a thixotrope. An attempt to produce a cellular polyurethane according to the procedure described in said British patent using a thixotrope was not successful. The composition of theBritish patent cannot be made thixotropic because the isocyanate alone is fed through the continuous mixer.Thixotropy is obtained by the addition of hydroxylcontaining com oullJs which are reactive with the isocyanate.This leads to premature cross linking of the isocyanate.Thus, the thixotrope can no longer effectively perform its intended function. THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a frothable thermo setting polyurethane forming composition, a process for pro ducing a curable froth from said composition, a process for applying the curable froth to a substrate and a cured cellular polyurethane produced from the curable froth. THE COMPOSITION The composition of this invention comprises a frothable thermosetting polyurethane forming composition in which the density of the cured foam therefrom is essentially the same as the density of the froth composi tion, when cured such that at least one surface of the froth is exposed to the atmosphere, which composition comprises a a polyol, b a polyisocyanate, c a thixotroping agent, d an inert gas, e an amount of moisture available for reaction with the polyisocyanate that is less than that amount which would cause the composition to cure to a cellular polyurethane having a density which is not essentially the same density as that of the frothed composition. The composition can optionally include one or more of the following a catalyst, a surfactant, a moisture absorbing material, a filler, a flame retardant, a dye, a pigment, or any other ingredient which would introduce an insignificant amount of moisture into the composition. The composition of this invention does not include a chemical blowing agent. In the preferred embodiment of this invention the composition includes a catalyst as defined , infra. The composition of this invention is preferably used in the form of three 8 packages , i.e., a polyol package which contains the polyol, thixotrope and one or more of the optional ingredients an isocyanate package which contains the isocyanate and a catalyst package which contains a catalyst which catalyzes the urethane forming reaction, and a solvent for the catalyst.However in another embodiment of this invention, the catalyst nay be onitted or it may be in the polyol packag. and thus only two packages are required, i.e., the polyol package and the isocyanate package. An inert gas is added to produce a froth. Preferred polyols or mixtures of polyols useful in the present invention have the following characteristics an average hydroxyl number as low as possible and not greater than about 300 a viscosity at 25 C of less than about 5000, and preferably less than about 2000 centipoise a functionality of greater than or equal to 2, preferably greater than or equal to 3 a hygroscopicity the percent weight gain of a 30 gram sample in a 2 5 8 X 7 8 inch circular metal dish placed in a humidity chamber at 90 percent rel ive humidity at 260C, for 24 hours of less than about 7, preferably less than about 1.

A preferred class of polyether polyols employed in this invention can be represented generally by the following formula R OCnH2n zOH a wherein R is hydrogen or a polyvalent hydrocarbon radical a is an integer e.g., I or 2 to 6 to 8 equal to the valence of R, n in each occurrence is an integer from 2 to 4 inclusive preferably 3 and z in each occurrence is an integer having a value of from 2 to about 200, preferably from 15 to about 100.

The preferred polymers of cyclic esters have a reduced viscosity value of from about 0.3 to about 10. These polymers are homopolymers or copolymers characterized as containing units of the formula EMI14.1 wherein each Rl,individually, is hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy wherein A is an oxy group where x is an integer from 1 to 4 wherein c is an integer from 1 to 4 wherein b is an integer of zero or one the sum of x c b is at least 4 and not greater than 6 and the total number of Rlgroups include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, secbutyl, t butyl, hexyl, chloro, bromo, iodo, methoxy, ethoxy, n butoxy, n hexoxy, 2 ethylhexoxy, dodecoxy, and the like. It is preferred that each 1 individually, be hydrogen, lower alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isobutyl, and or lower alkoxy, e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, n butoxy, and the like. It is further preferred that the total number of carbon atoms in the Rlsubstituents does not exceed eight. In one embodiment, preferred polymers of cyclic esters contain both recurring structural Unit 1 and units of the formula EMI14.2 wherein each R , individually, is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or chloroalkyi, or in which the two Rl vari ables together with the ethylene moiety of the oxyethylene chain of Unit II form a saturated cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon ring having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, desirably from 5 to 6 carbon atoms and w is an integer of 1 or more, preferably 1 to 10. It is preferred that recurring Unit II contain from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. Illustrative R variables include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, t butyl, the hexyls, the dodecyls. 2 chloroethyl, phenyl, phenethyl, ethylphenyl, cyclopentyl, cycxohexyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.It is preferred that R be hydrogen lower alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, chioroalkyl, e.g., 2 chloroethyl and the like. The aforedescribed recurring Unit I is interconnected through the oxy group. O j of one unit with the carbonyl groupEMI15.1 of a second unit, i.e., the interconnection does not involve the direct bonding of two carbonyl groups.EMI15.2 On the other hand, the relatively low molecular weight cyclic ester polymers, e.g., those having reduced viscosity values below about 0.3 are characterized by end groups which can be hydroxyl or carboxyl. Cyclic ester polymers having an average molecular weight of about 500 to about 2000 are preferred for use herein. The preparation of the cyclic ester polymers is well documented in the patent literature as exemplified byU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,021,309 through 3,021,317 3,169,945 and 2,962,524. Briefly, the process involves the polymerization of a mixture containing at least one cyclic ester monomer with or without a functional initiator there for such as the polyols described hereinbefore and in the patents mentioned above, and a suitable catalyst, the choice of which will depend on the presence or absence of added initiator. Suitable cyclic ester monomers which can be employed in the manufacture of the cyclic ester polymers are best illustrated by the following formula EMI16.1 wherein the R1, A, x, c, and b variables have the signifi cance noted in Unit I supra.Representative cyclic ester monomers which are contemplated include, for example deltavalerolactone epsilon caprolactone, zeta enantho lactone the monoalkyldelta valero lactones, e.g., the monomethyl , monoethyl , monohexyl , delta valerolactones, and the like.In the absence of added functional initiator, the polymerization process is desirably effected under the operative conditions and, as notes in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,021,309 to 3,021,317, in the presence of anionic catalysts. When reacting a mixture containing cyclic ester monomer and func tional initiator which possesses at least one active hydrogen substituent, e.g., carboxyl or hydroxyl, it is desirable to use the catalysts noted in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,878,236, 2,890,208, 3,169,945 and 3,284,417 under the under the operative conditions discussed therein. Suitable polyol initiators and polycarboxylic acid initiators are those listed in U.S. Pat. 3,169,945 and others of the patents enumerated herein as well as those polyols and polycarboxylic compounds listed hereinbefore. Polymers of cyclic esters can also be manufactured via the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,962,524. Cyclic ester alkylene oxide copolymers can also be prepared by reacting a mixture comprising cyclic ester and alkylene oxide monomers, an interfacial agent such as a solid, relatively high molecular weight poly vinylstea rate or lauryl methacrylate vinyl chloride copolymer reduced viscosity in cyclohexanone at 30 C. of from about 0.3 to about 1.0 , in the presence of an inert, normally liquid, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon vehicle such as heptane and phosphorus pentafluoride as the catalyst therefor, at an elevated tempature, e.g., about 800 C., and for a period of time sufficient to produce such cyclic ester alkylene oxide copolymers. When the cyclic ester polymers are prepared from a mixture containing the cyclic ester monomer and minor amounts of cyclic comonomer which is copolymerizable therewith, e.g., cyclic carbonates and cyclic ethers such as alkylene oxide, oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, etc. the polymeric chain of the resulting copolymeric product will be characterized by both recurring linear Unit I, supra,as well as the recurring linear Unit II which would represent the alkylene oxide comonomer polymerized therein and or by a recurring linear unit which would correspond to the additional polymerizable cyclic comonomer in the monomer mixture. When the comonomer is an alkylene oxide, the resulting copolymeric product will contain both recurring linear Unit I and recurring linear Unit II in the copolymeric chain thereof.The interconnection of linear Unit I and linear Unit II supra does not involve or result in the direct bonding of two oxy groups, i.e., In In other words, the oxy group OO of recurring linear Unit II is interconnected with the carbonyl croup EMI18.1 of recurring linear Unit I supra or with the alkylene moiety of a second oxyalkylene Unit if . PoLymers of cyclic esters as described above are useful in producing polyurethane articles having comparatively high strength and elongation. As mentioned previously, the polymers of cyclic esters which are contemplated are expressed in terms of their reduced viscosity values. As is well known in the art, reduced viscosity value is a measure or indication of the molecular weight of polymers. The expression 1,reduced viscosity is a value obtained by dividing the specific viscosity by the concentration of polymer in the solution, the concentration being measured in grams of polymer per 100 milliliters of solvent. The specific viscosity is obtained by dividing the difference between the viscosity oS the solution and the viscosity of the solvent by the viscosity of the solvent.Unless otherwise noted, the reduced viscosity values herein referred to are measured at a concentration of 0.2 grams of polymer in 100 milliliters of solvent e.g., cyclohexanone, benzene, chloroform, toluene, or other common organic solvents at 300 C. Another type of active hydrogen containing materials useful in this invention are the polymer polyol compositions obtained by polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers in a polyol as described in British Pat.No. 1,063,222 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,351, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable monomers for producing such compositions include acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride, styrene, butadiene, vinylidene chloride and other ethylenically unsaturated monomers as identified and described in the above mentioned British patent and U.S. patent. Suitable polyols include those listed and described hereinabove and in the British patent and U.S. patent. The polymer polyol compositions can contain from about 1 to about 70 weight percent, preferably about 5 to about 50 weight percent, and most preferably about 10 to about 40 weight percent monomer polymerized in the polyol.Such compositions are conveniently prepared by polymerizing the monomers in the selected polyol at a emperature of 40 C. to 1500 C. in the presence of a free radical polymerization catalyst such as peroxides, persulfates, percarbonates,perborates and azo compounds.Further details of the compositions and methods of making same are described in the above mentioned British patent and U.S. patent.

Any thixotrope can be used in the composition of the present invention such as colloidal silica, hydrogenated castor oil, bentonite clays. The preferred thixotrope is hydrogenated castor oil. The thixotrope is used in amounts of from about 1 to about 15, and preferably, from about 2 to about 10, parts per 100 parts of polyol s by weight. When a catalyst is used in the composition a wide variety of urethane forming catalysts can be used. Preferabfy, the catalyst has the following characteristics a high activity for the reaction of isocyanate and organic hydroxyl groups low activity for the reaction of isocyanate and water high solubility in polyols the ability to delay the viscosity increase in bulk after the catalyst is mixed into the froth its catalytic effect being delayed for a brief time period in the temperature range of about 5 to about 400C delay time of about 30 seconds to about 120 seconds is preferable high solubility in the diluent. These catalysts include dialkyl tin carboxylates, such as dibutyl tin dilautate, dioleate, diacetate, or di 2 ethylhexoate, and the like dimethyl tin dithiolaurate, stannous octoate, stannous oleate, potassium octoate, potassium acetate, phenyl mercuric propionate, iron 111 acetyl acetonate, copper II acetyl acetonate, zinc octoate, zinc acetate, cobalt II acetate, manganese II acetate, isopropyl titanate, triacryl isopropyl titanate, lead naphthanate, cobalt naphthanate, bismuth nitrate, ferric III chloride, sodium silicate, aluminum acetyl acetonate, zinc acetyl acetonate, nickel 11 acetyl acetonate, methyl titanate and zinc stearate. Particularly effective catalysts are those with tin sulfur bonds and include, for example, dibutyl tin sulfide, and the like, and dialkyl tin dithiodialkylidene diesters of the following formula EMI25.1 therein R2 and R3 are independently alkyl, arylalkyl, and alkylaryl containing l to about 20 carbon atoms, and d is an integer of 1 to 8 and d is an integer of from 1 to 10. Preferably, R2 and R3 is alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms and d is an integer of 1 to 4. Also, tertiary amines may be used as the catalyst. These tertiary amines can be illustrated by the following formula EMI25.2 wherein R6, R7, and K8 are independently selected from the group consisting of aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl radicals wherein the aryl, alkylaryl and arylalkyl radicals contain from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, the alkyl radicals contain from 6 to 18 carbon atoms, the alkenyl radicals contain from about 3 t6 18 carbon atoms, and saturated 5 and 6 membered heterocyclic radicals containing from one to three nitrogen atoms, a is an integer of from 1 to 5.EMI26.1 Wherein R9, R19 and R11 are idependently sel ected from N R12 or monofunctional optionally substi R13 tuted hydrocarbon radicals, with the proviso that at least one of Rg, R10 or R11 is a CH2 e N R 12 radical R 13 wherein Rg and R10 are selected from Cl to C6 alkyl,C2 to C6 hydroxyalkyl and e is 0 to 10 As examples of optionally substituted hydrocarbon radicals there may be mentioned morpholinoalkyl piperidinoalkyl, alkylamino alky I hydroxyalkyl alkoxyalkyl and alkylcarbonyloxyalkyl. These triazine containing compounds are known in the art as shown for example in U.S. Patent 3,884,917. The amines suitable for use herein include triethylene diamine, N,N dimethylcyclohexylamine, triethylamine, N ethylmorpholine, N methyl 2,2 dialkyl 1,3oxazolidines, N alkylpiperadines, N,N dialkylpiperazines, tetramethyl 1,3 butane diamine, dimethylethanol amine, bis dimethylamino diethyl ether, imidazole, N,N ,N tris 3 dimethylaminopropyl S hexahydrotriazine. Also, mixtures of the above catalysts can be used. The catalyst is used in amounts of as little as 0.01 parts by weight, to about 0.50 parts by weight, based on the weight of the polyol s . The amount of catalyst used depends upon the froth temperature into which the catalyst is injected, the amount and alkalinity of any fillers present, the reactivity of the polyol s and the temperature of the substrate to which it is being applied. For example, a catalyst such as a dialkyl tin dithioalkylidene diester is used only in amounts of about 0.1 part when the froth temperature is about 40 C, and the substrate temperature of a wall panel, for example is about 250C.When the froth temperature is lower than about 400C, and the substrate temperature is lower than about 25 C, then more than 0.1 part and as much as 0.50 parts by weight of the catalyst per 100 parts of polyol s can be used. The catalyst is generally added in a solvent.This solvent may be selected from a wide variety of materials. The solvent may be a polyol, or a polyamine, for example, those described, supra, or a surfactant as described infra, or a plasticizer such as a dialkyl phthalate.Generally, the catalyst is dissolved in from about 10 to about 100 parts of solvent per part of catalyst. The catalyst can be mixed with the solvent and this mixture added to the froth foam and mixed with the froth foam. When the catalyst is added in this manner it is dissolved in solvent. This represents the preferred method of adding the catalyst. Alternatively, relatively large amounts of catalysts which are insoluble in polyols, such as bismuth and silicate containing catalysts, specifically Bi N03 3 and Na2SiO3, can be mixed with said polyol s and solubilized by the subsequent addition of simple glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerin, or mixtures thereof. Since the catalyst is not soluble in the polyol no gelation occurs in the hose dispensing the froth. If the catalyst were soluble in the polyol, and it was added to the polyol package, in said large amounts, gelation would in fact occur in the dispensing means and plug it. The composition of this invention may optionally contain one or more of the following ingredients surfactant, water scavenger, filler, flame retardant, dyes, pigments, and the like. The surfactant is preferably an organosilicon copolymer as described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,772,224 and 4,022,722. Another organosilicon surfactant is a partially cross linked siloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymer and mixtures thereof, wherein the siloxane blocks and polyox yalkylene blocks are linked by silicon to carbon, or by silicon to oxygen to carbon, linkages. The siloxane blocks are comprised of hydrocarbon siloxane groups and have an average of at least two valences of silicon per block combined in said linkages. At least a portion of the polyoxyalkylene blocks are comprised of oxyalkylene groups and are polyvalent, i.e., have at least two valances of carbon and or carbon bonded oxygen per block combined in said linkages. Any remaining polyoxyalkylene blocks are comprised of oxyalkylene groups and are monovalent, i.e., have only one valence of carbon or carbon bonded oxygen per block combined in said Linkages. Additionally, conventional Organo polysiloxane poly,oxyalkylene block copolymers such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,834,748, 2,846,458, 2,868,824, 2,917,480 and 3,957,901 can be employed. A further surfactant which can be used herein is a high molecular weight linear non hydrolyzable AB siloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymer as described inU.S. Patent 4,022,722, which is incorporated herein by reference. These block copolymeric as described in V.S.Patent 4,022,722 have the following average formula EMI29.1 wherein Rl4 and R 14 independently represent a monovalent hydrocarbon radical free from aliphatic unsaturation, n is an integer of from 2 to 4 inclusive C is an integer of at least 6 f is an integer of at least 4 g is an inteer of at least 4 3 represents a divalent organic group attached to the adjacent silicon atom by a carbon to silicon bond and to the polyox ialk lene block by an oxygen atom,with the proviso that cne Y group is present in the formula the average molecular weight of each siloxane block being from acout 500 to acout 10,000 t e average molecular weightof each polyoxyalkylene block being fron about 300 to about 10,000 said siloxane blocks constituting from about 20 to about 50 weight percent of the copolymer the polyoxyalkylene blocks constituting about 80 to about 50 weight percent of the copolymer and the block copolymer having an average molecular weight of at least about 30,000. The surfactant can be used in amounts of fron 1 to about 10, and preferably, from about l to about 4 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . The moisture absorbing materials which can be used in this invention include nolecular sieves of the zeolite type, silicates, such as ethyl silicates, oxazolidines carbodiimides, inorganic materials such as magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride and any other inorganic salts capable of hydrating with water. Molecular sieves are preferred. The moisture absorbing material can be used in amounts of from about 1 to about 15, and preferably, from about 3 to about 7 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . Suitable fillers which can be used include, for example, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, alumina trihydrate, and the like. Preferably, the filler has low adsorbed moisture. The filler may have a catalytic effect in this invention. The fillers can be used in amounts up to about 250, and preferably from about 100 to about 200 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . When it is desired to prepare cured polyurethane foams having fire retardant properties, fire retardant compounds may be added to the composition. Suitable fire retardant compounds include alumina trihydrate, phosphoruscontaining compounds including, for example, tricresyl phosphate and the like, halogenated phosphates including, for example, trisdichloropropyl phosphate. In the practice of this invention the uncured froth has a density of from about 18 to about 45 lbs. ft.3.The density of the froth is approximately equal to the density of the cellular polyurethane formed. The ingredients of the composition are so chosen so that the amount of moisture in the composition is less than that amount which would cause the composition to cure to a cellular polyurethane having a density which is not essentially the same density as that of the frothed composition. The composition of this invention forms a cellular polyurethane wherein there is essentially no postb low. The amount of moisture in the composition can be controlled to be as low as possible by having the ingredients introduce an insignificant amount of moisture into the composition. This is accomplished by, for example, choosing a polyol with an average hydroxy number as low as possible a low hygroscopicity and choosing an isocyanate which is capable of curing with the polyol inas short a time period as possible. A urethaneforming catalyst may be added to effect a faster curing rate. If a polyol is chosen which has a high hydroxyl number or a high hygroscopicity, then a moisture absorbing material may be added to the composition. Thus, it can be seen that by correlating the various ingredients, a composition containing a minimum amount of moisture can be achieved. THE PROCESS The curable froth foam is prepared by mixing air or other gaseous substance with the polyol including thixotrope and one or more optional ingredients , and the isocyanate. Preferably the catalyst,when used, is added to the foam produced by mixing the gas, polyol including thixotrope and one or more optional ingredients and isocyanate. Suitable gaseous substances which are employed in the present invention include any gaseous element, compound, or mixture thereof which exists in the gaseous state under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, i.e., 250C and one atmosphere, including for example, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and air, or mixtures thereof, provided such do not react with or significantly dissolve into any of the urethane forming components. Dry nitrogen or dry air is the preferred gas. Specifically, in preparing the curable foam, the isocyanate, and the polyol.containing thixotrope, and one or more of the optional ingredients described, supra, are metered separately and in fixed nroportions into a mixer, preferably an SKG or Oakes continuous mixer. The gaseous material under pressure may be metered into either the polyol or isocyanate stream or into both or it may be metered directly into the mixer containing the polyurethane forming components. A dense froth is formed in the mixer under a pressure which is above atmospheric pressure and from about 40 to about 150 psig. The froth is then fed from the mixer into a delivery tube. The froth expands in volume i.e. decreases in density as the entrained air bubbles expand with decreased pressure as the foam proceeds towards the outlet of the delivery tube.Preferably, catalyst is injected into the froth at a point downstream in the delivery tube and dispersed by passing the foam catalyst mixture through an in line mixer. The catalyzed froth is then directed onto a substrate. Zn order to describe more definitively many of the embodiments of the process of this invention, reference is made to Figure I which schematically depicts a flow diagram of a desirable embodiment of this Invention and Figure 2 which depicts a side view of vessels 29 and 30 of Figure 1. In discussing Figures 1 and 2 the descriptions are purely illustrative and are not intended to be in any sense limiting. To those skilled in the art to which this invention relates, many changes in construction and different embodiments will suggest themselves without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In the process of this invention the polyol package the polyol package will hereinafter and for purposes of this discussion be referred to as the polyol contained in vessels 29 and 30, isocyanate contained in vessel 28 and catalyst contained in vessel 27 are pumped to mixers by pumps 34, 33 and 32, respectively. These pumps are driven by a motor 35. The utilization of a single motor to drive the pumps assures a fixed, constant, ratio of the materials from vessels 27, 28, 29 and 3O, since all pumps are of a positive displacement type. The polyol is drawn from vessels 29 and 30 and pumped at a constant rate by pump 34 whose output is fixed to the drive motor speed.The pump may be a Moyno unit manufactured by Robbins andMeyers Corporation . The output may vary from about 100 to about 200 grams or more per minute bv varying the drive speed and sizing the components. Isocyanate is drawn from tank 28 through line 55 and optionally, through filter 57 which removes any impurities or previously reacted material. Pump 33 may be a gear type unit manufactured by Zenith Corporation, whose output of 30 to Sn g min. or more is determined by the speed of drive motor 35. This output is carried through lines 59, 61 and 64 and valve 62. At various times during the froth generation process it may be desirable to discontinue isocyanate flow without interrupting the flow of the other systems.This capability is embodied in valves 62 and 66 and lines 67 and 65. By blocking flow through valve 62the output of pump 33 reaches a pressure of about 100 psi which causes check valve 66 to open passing fluid through line 65. This fluid is then recirculated through filter 57 and pump 33 until the drive motor 35 is stopped or valve 62 is reopened. Similarly, catalyst is drawn from tank 27 through line 77, to be pumped and metered by the single piston pump 32. The output flow of from about 0,5 to about 5 gamin. may be recirculated by closing valve 81 which causes flow through lines 84 and 83, when output pressure causes check valve 85 to open automatically. The chemical supply tanks 27, 28, 29 and 30 are pressurized to minimize the possibility of contamination and reduce the power output requirement of motor 35. This is accomplished by introducing gas from tank l through a set of pressure reducing valves 5 and 9 and a control valve, ll, through line 20 to the top of each tank. The chemical fluids thus reach the same pressure as line 20, about 60 psi, to facilitate fluid flow through the inlet lines to each pump thus minimizing the posse billy of cavitation and unreliable metering. Froth generation is accomplished mechanically by a mixer 47, driven by motor 48. Air is drawn from tank 1, through valves 5, 18, 70 and 73 and lines 17, 68 69, 72 and 74, such that a constant flow rate is maintained. This air and the polyol are introduced into the mixer via line 46. Isocyanate is added via line 64 and the polyol and air is mixed and whipped into a froth.Line 64 is of a small diameter to maintain a high fluid velocity and minimize any backs low of reactive material which could cause a blockage. The urethane froth is delivered by line 75 to a catalyst injector 76. Catalyst flows via line 82 to the catalyst injector. Line 82 is of a small diameter to minimize elastic effects of the line and fluid, enhancing consistent system operation. The froth with catalyst passes into a static mixer, 86, which blehds said components to a uniform homogeneous state. The curable froth may be applied directly to a substrate or may be applied with an applicator 87, whose purpose is to distribute the froth into a preferred configuration. Specifically, with reference to the Figure 1, vessel 1 is a source of dry gaseous material, which is preferably dry nitrogen or dry air. Gas from vessel 1 passes through lines 2 and 4 at a pressure of about 2700 psig and then through pressure reducing valve 5 where it is reduced to about 200 psig. A portion of the gas passes via lines 6 and 7 to pressure reducing valve 9 which reduces the pressure to about 60 to 70 psig. The other portion of the gas passes via lines 6 and 17 to pressure reducing valve 18 which reduces the pressure to about 100 to 150 psig. Pressure switch 8 monitors the gas supply level. Gage 3 displays the gas pressure. The gas from pressure reducing valve 9 passes via line 10 to direction control valve 11, then via lines 12 and 20 a portion goes via line 26 to form pressure on the contents of vessel 27 a portion via line 25 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 28 a portion via lines 21 and 22 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 29 and a portion via lines 21 and 24 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 30. In an optional embodiment, gas passes from valve 11 via lines 12 and 14 through pressure reducing valve 15 where it is reduced to about 5 psi and flows through line 16 where it exerts a pressure on the contents of vessel 93.The contents of vessel 93 comprise a cleaning or flushing solvent. When the process is started polyol contained in vessels 29 and or 30, isocyanate contained in vessel 28 and catalyst contained in vessel 27 are pumped to mixers by pumps 34, 33, and 32, respectively, which mixers are driven by motor 35. Specifically, polyol contained in vessels 29 and 30 pass via lines 36 and 31, respectively, then through lines 37, 38 and 4L, through pump 34 and line 42 to mixer 47 which is driven by motor 48. Polyol in vessels 29 and 30 can be used concurrently or sequentially. In á preferred embodiment vessels 29 and 30 contain floating pistons 52 and 53. These pistons help completely empty the vessel especially when a viscous polyol is used. Additionally, the piston cuts off the supply of polyol when a vessel becomes empty so that flow from the second vessel can commence.Pressure switch 54 detects a difference in pressure to indicate that both tanks are empty. Vessel 40 is a reservoir for polyol. It is a one quart bladder accumulator. When the pumping process is started, the polyol from either vessel flows into accumulator 40 and fills it. when both vessels 29 and 30 are empty of polyol, pressure switch 54 is activated and polyol from vessel 40 flows at reduced pressure into pump 34 and into mixer 47 as previously described, to prevent cavitation during the shutdown sequence. Isocyanate is pumped into mixer 47 by passing from vessel 28 via lines 55 and 56 optionally through filter 57,via line 58 through pump 33via lines 59 and 61, valve 62 and lines 63 and 64. At times, it may be desirable to discontinue the isocyanate flow without stopping the flow of the other components. In this optional system, flow is discontinued by closing valve 62 which causes the output of pump 33 to reach a pressure of about 100 psi which causes valve 66 to open and allows isocyanate to pass through line 65. The isocyanate is then recirculated through filter 57 and pump 33 until motor 35 stops or valve 62 is reopened. Air is supplied to mixer 47 to produce a froth.Air is supplied from tank 1 to mixer 47 by passing via li nes 2 and 4, valve 5, lines 6 and 17, pressure regulator 18, lines 68 and 69, direction control valve 70, line 72, flow regulator 73, line 74 where the air meets with the polyol from line 42 at tee 43, then both materials pass through line 46 into the mixer 47. At the same time isocyanate is flowing into mixer 47, as described, suPra. The froth formed is delivered from mixer 47 to catalyst injector 76 via line 75. The catalyst. is delivered to catalyst injector 76 by passing it from vessel 27 through lines 77 and 78 through pump 32, via lines 79 and 80, through valve 81 and via line 82. In an optional embodiment, the catalyst may be recirculated by closing valve 81 which causes flow through valve 85 and lines 83 and 78 when the pressure causes valve 85 to open automatically, The preferred catalyst injector is described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. D 12,699 , titied Apparatus for Mixing Chesicat Components 1, filed on the same date as this application by B. Pinkston, and assigned to the same assignee as this invention. The appar atus described in said Application Serial No. D 12,699 is an apparatus for producing a mixture of chemical components which comprises an elongated housing containing a a tube extending there through having at least one inlet means for supplying at least one component into said tube whereby said components flow from said inlet means to outlet means at the other end of said tube b inlet means for supplying at least one component either reactive with one or more components of a or catalyzing the reaction of two or more components of a , said inlet means in communication with an annular groove within a conical member which receives said component s , c means for distributing said compon ent s from the annular groove to a plurality of grooves in said conical member, said grooves directing the component s into the flow of the component s of a in said tube. Static mixer 86 mixes the catalyst and the froth.The froth can then be deposited onto a substrate by an applicator 87. Applicator 87 can arrange the foam in a preferred configuration. In an optional embodiment of this invention, a solvent may be used to flush the following mixer 47 line 64 carrying materials from the isocyanate vessel line 75 which carries roth from nixer 47 catalyst injector 76 mixer 86 and applicator 87. Air is passed to vessel93 , to pressurize the solvent therein, from regulator 11 through line 12, tee 19, line 14, regulator 15 which reduces the pressure to about 5 psi as required through line 16 to create a pressure on the contents of vessel 93. To prepare the solvent flush system for use, air from line 101 is directed by valve 103 into line 104, filling and pressurizing cavity 94 in cylinder 105 Cylinder 105 has a 2 inch bore . This causes piston rod assembly 95 to move and hence increasing the volume of cavity 96 in cylinder 108. Cylinder 108 has a 4 inch bore. As that volume is increased, solvent is drawn via line 88, check valve 90 and line 107 filling cavity 96. This system is ready to flush. When it is desired to flush the system valve 103 is electrically driven to its other position such that the air from line 101 now passes into line 102 to fill and pressurize cavity 97.The pressure exerted in 97 then decreases the volume of cavity 96 causing the solvent contained therein to pass through line 109 through check valve 110 and lines Ill and 64 into mixer 47 which flushes out the reactive materials therein cleaning the mixer and down stream components ultimately existing through applicator 87.Preferred solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, or ketones such as acetone or methylethylketone. The total motion for piston rod assembly 95 from end to end is 3 inches. Figure 2 is a side view of a vessel, depicted as 29 and 30 in Figure I which is used to hold the polyol package. Tank cylinder 201 is a seven gallon aluminum cylinder containing a top 207 to which handle 208 is attached. Tne to can te removed and the polyol added thereto. Crings 205 provide a seal to prevent materials from leaking out between the top and sides of the cylinder. Air inlet 203 receives air under pressure and creates a pressure on piston 206 forcing it against the contents of the vessel and causing the contents to be forced through suction tube 207 through outlet 204 and into the systen. When the cyl inder has been emptied of its contents, piston 206 is in position A, and seals the system by sealing suction tube 202. It has been found in the process of this invention that when the catalyst is injected into the froth and then mixed with the froth in a mixer, the time to cure the froth is greatly reduced. This represents the preferred method of adding the catalyst. Using this technique of catalyzing the froth the major portion of the cure can take place in about 90 seconds in mass and in about 30 to about 50 minutes in a thin layer. Additionally, besides accelerating cure, said catalyst addition preserves the working life of the froth in the hose precluding gelation or building up of highly viscous or gelled material on the wall of the hose. The hose carries the froth from the mixer to the substrate on which it is deposited.Further, it has been found by adding the catalyst post expansion of the froth is minimized after it has been spread over a substrate, such as a joint formed by the abutting relationship of two wallboards, for example. When isocyanate reacts with noisture producing C02, ost foaming occurs resulting in an uneven surface. The catalyst addition, as described, results in an accelerated cure as the froth passes through the hose and is applied to the substrate, so that post foaming is essentially eliminated when polyol s with sufficiently low hygroscopicity are used. If a catalyst soluble n polyot is acted to the polyol package, it has been found that there is a build up of viscous or gelled material on the hose wall which necessitates that the hose be changed after only a relatively short period of operation, such as from 30 to 60 minutes, which will vary depending on the amount of catalyst added. It has further been found that if certain catalysts insoluble in the polyol are added to the polyol package, they can be solubilized by the addition of a simple glycol injected into the froth resulting in a process where no gelation can occur in the hose dispensing the froth prior to glycol addition. This represents another embodiment of this invention. The process is carried out at ambient temperatures of from about 0 to about 400C. The froth as it emerges from the dispensing hose is structurally stable and easily workable at ambient temperatures. The consistency of the froth closely resembles the consistency of aerosol dispensed shaving cream. The uncured froth has a density of from about 18 to about 45 lbs. ft.3, and preferably, from about 20 to about 35 lbs. ft.3. The density of the froth is approximately equal to the density of the cured foam. The cell size of the uncured catalyzed froth is dependent upon, for example, froth density the speed of the mixer which mixes the isocyanate, polyol and gas the viscosity of the system and the type and amount of surfactant in the formulation. The froth is preferably produced in the apparatus described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. D 12,684 titled Apparatus for Producing Foam , filed on the same date as this application by B. Barth et al. and assigned to the same assignee as this invention. The apparatus described in said Application Serial No, D 12,684 is an apparatus for the continuous production of a curable polyurethane froth, which apparatus comprises separate sources of a polyol, an isocyanate, a catalyst and an inert gas, means Ir.r ucing separate conduits for feeding said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas separately and under pressure at controlled flow rates from said sources to a mixing device containing inlet openings to receive said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas, means for mixing said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas to produce a froth, and an outlet opening for the resulting froth, means for delivering the froth from said mixing device to a second mixing device, a conduit for feeding the catalyst under pressure at a controlled flow rate to the second mixing device, and means for mixing the froth and catalyst, said mixing device containing inlet openings to receive the froth and catalyst and an outlet opening for the resulting catalyzed froth and means for delivering the catalyzed froth from the mixing device onto a substrate. The froth foam produced from the composition of this invention and by the instant process has utilitv as, for example, an adhesive for bonding panels to framing, particularly for bonding dry wall panels to wooden framing a flame retardant insulating material insulating material around doors and windows patching wood patching concrete patching cinder blocks it can be formed into a temporary walkway or road over soft ground a highway medium divider post hole filler material to eliminate contact of the post with the earth since it provides almost instant support covering, protecting and insulating wrap for buried piping a packing material repair holes, dents in vehicles a dry wall joint sealer. Thus, the instant invention concerns an article comprising at least one surface and a surface containing a plurality of materials having an essentially monolithic appearance, one such material at such surface being a polyurethane foam as cured at such surface. The catalyzed froth is preferably used as a joint sealer to seal the joint formed by placing panels, particularly dry wall panels, into an abutting relationship with one another. In the construction of buildings with so called dry walls, it is conventicnal to apply a compound to the joints of wallboard panels to conceal the joints to present a monolithic appearing surface. A drying tyDe compound typically composed of calcium carbonate, polyvinyl acetate latex, and water is most often used. Problems associated with use of this type of compound are long drying time and shrinkage,which commonly necessitate the application of three coats of compound with an overnight drying period between each coast. These problems are especially acute with the major prefabricated production builders who can erect a house in one day starting with prefabricated panelized units. The need to devote three additional days to seaming the joints is partiularly vexing. An improved seaming material that can be applied rapidly and smoothly in one day 5 time, that does not shrink, and sets to a paintable surface overnight has been discovered herein. The froth, as described, when applied to the joints of wall board panels to conceal the joints cures rapidly and in an essentially dimensionally stable manner in thin and thick sections its cure is relatively independent of ambient conditions, i.e., it can be applied over a range of temperatures and relative humidities it has good adhesion to the wallboard it is sag resistant, it is trowelable it has a smooth surface. Upon cure, it is resilient, easily sanded and readily decoratable. When the froth cures it does not essentially expand or contract, thus it provides a monolithic appearing wall. The froth foam may be applied to the substrate by any conventional means. In the case of applying the froth foam to conceal the joint formed by abutting dry walls, the foam can be applied by means of an applicator to fill the joint. In other applications, the froth may be allowed to fill a cavity, etc. to the extent desired. THE CURED FROTH The cured cellular polyurethane of this invention has an essentially closed cell structure. The cells are essentially spherical and less than about 300 microns in diameter. The cell diameter ranges from about 5 to about 300 microns. The site of the cell which forms the skin surface of the polyurethane foam has a dimension which is essentially equivalent to the size of the cell in the mid interior of the foam. Thus, from surface to surface, the size of the cells of the polyurethane foam, exclusive of those cells which are adhesively bonded to a substrate and are contiguous thereto, are essentially uniform. Such uniformity is reflective of the average uniformity that one would find in the mid section of such a polyurethane foam. The density of the cured foam is approximately equal to the density of the froth prior to curing. The cured polyurethane is resilient, sandable and can be easily decorated. EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A This Example essentially duplicates Example 9 of U.S. Patent 3,821,120 to Barron et al. 360 grams of the reaction product of glycerine with propylene oxide end capped with about 5 moles of ethylene oxide per OH group and having an OH equivalent weight of about 1600, 40 grams of diethylene glycol, and 164 g of a polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate having an average functionality of 2.6 and an NCO equivalent weight of about 134 were placed into a Hobart mixer equipped with wire agitator for whipping air into the mixture and whipped at high speed for 2 minutes to provide a froth. After the whipping was completed, the catalyst, 1 gram of a 33 percent solution of triethylenediamine in dipropylene glycol, was added and the resultant froth mixed for an additional 40 seconds. The froth was poured into 4 x 2 x 3 8 inch molds formed by cutting out 4 x 2 inch cavities in a 3 8 inch gypsum board and gluing to a second piece of gypsum board. Note The froth was liquid so that the mold had to be placed horizontally. Thus, the formulation could not be applied in a vertical manner. After filling the molds, the surfaces were evened off by drawing a flat steel blade across the surfaces of the molds and the froth. Two samples were made with the formulation. One sample was cured under ambient laboratory conditions of 260C and 60 percent relative humidity the other cured in an environmental chamber at 26 C and 90 percent relative humidity. The density of the froth was measured before adding the catalyst and found to be 22.5 lbs. ft.3. This is contrary to the density of 8.95 lbs. ft.3 reported in the Barron patent which was measured on the cured product. Postblow was recorded as the difference in thickness tetween the cured froth and depth of the mold.Nominal mold depth was 375 mils. The postblow of the cured froth was determined by measuring the thickness in mils of the cured froth in the mold and subtracting the depth of the mold cavity. Postblow was found to be 81 96 mils for the sample cured at 60 percent relative humidity and 84 91 mils for 90 percent relative humidity. This is contrary to the following statement in column 2, lines 16 to 22 of the Barron et al. patent The conventional froth resulting from the mechanical inducing of inert gas into the utethane forming mixture does not undergo any subsequent significant expansion other than that caused by any thermal expansion of the inert gas employed which is very small, i.e., less than about 1 percent by volume. The following Examples l to 5 illustrate systems which result in an excessive amount of postblow. EXAMPLE 1 A polyol package was prepared by mixing in a closed 3 gallon container under a blanket of nitrogen, 80 parts by weight of a polyol comprising a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl number of 240, 20 parts by weight of a polyol of a propylene oxide adduct of an 80 20 mixture of sorbitol and propylene glycol, which polyol has a hydroxyl number of 490, 5 parts by weight of a thixotrope, hydrogenated castor oil, 1 part by weight of F 40 weight percent solution of a surfactnt which is of the formula AB wherein A is a block of dimethyl silicone units, B is a block of oxyalkylene units and n is greater than 20 hereinafter referred to as surfactant A in undecylbenzene and 5 parts by weight of 3A molecular sieves.The ingredients were mixed until the temperature reached 60 C at which point they were allowed to cool under nitrogen. The resultant formulated poo package was pumped through a pipe at 136.6 grams minute to the head of a 3 inch SKG continuous mixer where it was mixed with 65.8 grams, a stoichiometric amount i.e., NCO OH L.O , of polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate, and sufficient nitrogen to produce a froth with a density of 30 lbs. ft. 3. The isocyanate was delivered to the mixer by means of a Zenith metering pump at the rate of 80.8 grams minute through a 0.25 inch pipe. The resulting froth was fed through 8 feet of a 1 2 inch internal diameter vinyl hose to a static mixer 22 inches long, 3 4 inch nominal internal diameter polypropylene tube containing five 3 4 inch nominal outside diameter plastic mixing elements each 4.2 inches in length. The static mixer is sold under the trade name Stata tube by TAH Indust iPs, Inc., Imlaystown, New Jersey . At the entrance to the static mixer a 10 percent solution of a catalyst which is a dialkyl dinercaptide carb oxylic acid ester of the formulaEMI49.1 wherein R2 and R3 are CH3, n equals 2 and m is an integer of from 1 to 10. UL 24 sold by Witco ChemicaL Company hereinafter Catalyst A in a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl number of 240 was introduced into the froth at a rate of 3.1 grams minute using a micrometering pump and a tube such that the concentration of Catalyst A in the total formula was 0.25 parts per 100 parts based on polyol. The rate of catalyst addition was controlled to produce a froth that showed the initial signs of gelling in 80 seconds after filling an 8 ounce paper cup.The froth was deposited onto 18 inch long x 15 inch wide sections of dry wall containing a recessed joint and spread over the joint with one pass of a steel blade to form an initially smooth seam. No sagging of the froth occurred when held in a vertical position. The set time was 40 minutes. The set time is the time for a 30 mil film of the froth to reach the stage where it is not lifted from the dry wall substrate when lightly contacted with a 3 32 inch wooden dowel. A 4 x 2 x 0.07G inch casting was made of tne froth and placed Jn an environmental chamber at 260C and 90 percent relative humidity. After 24 hours, the thickness of the casting was determined to obtain a quantita tive measurement of the degree of postblow, by determining the amount by which the casting exceeded the original 70 mil thickness after curing in the environmental chamber. Thé postblow was 152 172 mils. Also, the seamed joint was qualitatively assessed by determining whether the surface was smooth or swollen. The surface was swollen. The results are summarized in Table I. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 1 was exactly repeated except that a 1 percent solution of catalyst was used and it was added to the froth at a rate of 3.8 grams minute such that the concentration of Catalyst A in the total formula was 0.31 parts per 100 parts based on polyol.

Also, postblow can be affected by changes in the structure of the polyol whether or not a significant change in hygroscopicity occurs. Comparison of Examples 6 and 7 with Example 4 illustrates this. While hygroscopicity of the polyols in Examples 6 and 7 is higher than the polyol used in Example 4, the amount of postblow is significantly less. Example 13 The following ingredients made up the polyol package 57.7 pounds of castor oil 14.4 pounds of a propylene oxide adduct of of an 80 20 mixture of sorbitol and propylene glycol, which polyol has hydroxy number of 490 4.3 pounds of hydrogenated castor oil 3.6 wound of 3A nolecular seives 0.7 pounds of surfactant A 72.1 pounds of alumina trihydrate 7.2 pounds of flame retardant A. The polyor package was charged to a 20 gallonMyers mixer. The air space in the mixer was flushed with nitrogen and the mixer sealed. The mixer was actuated and the ingredients mixed until a temperature of 60 C was reached which took about 20 minutes. The material was then discharged into three five gallon containers. The material was then fed to an SKG continuous mixer along with nitrogen under pressure about 30 70 psi back pressure . The nitrogen was fed into the polyol pipe just prior to the stream entering the continuous mixer. A stoichiometric amount of liquid polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate was also pumped into the continuous mixer by means of a Zenith metering pump through another pipe. The resulting froth was pumped through an 8 foot long by 1 2 inch internal diameter hose to a motionless mixer Stata Tube 20 65, 3 4 inch nominal diameter, 22 1 2 inch long . Immediately prior to the motionless mixer 5 weight percent of Catalyst A in a polyol comprising a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl nunber of 24 was injected by neans of a micro metering pump at a rate to provide 0.1 parts of catalyst per 100 parts by weight of polyol.The catalyst was dispersed in the froth by passing through the motionless mixer. The catalyzed froth was deposited onto a wall board joint and spread over the joint with a steel blade to form a smooth seam. The froth density was 32 lbs. ft.3. The seamed joint was cured vertically at 260C, and 90 relative umidity. No sagging or postfoaming of the seam occurred. It reached a gelled stage within 33 minutes and within 45 minutes a blade could be drawn over the surface without marring it. Example 14 The procedure of Example 13 was repeated except that the polyol package was made up of the following ingredients 5400 grams of a polyol comprising a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl number of 30 capped with ethylene oxide to give a hydroxyl number of 27 600 grams of ethylene glycol 300 grams of hydrogenated castor oil 300 grams of 3A molecular sieves and 60 grams of surfactant A. The froth was produced by the procedure described in Example 10. The froth was deposited Onto a wall board joint and spread over the joint with a steel blade to form a smooth seam. The froth density was 32 lbs. ft. . The seamed joint was cured vertically at 26 C and 90 relative humidity a No sagging or postfoaming af the seam occurred.The froth reached a gelled stage within 28 minutes and within 50 minutes a blade could be drawn over the surface without marring it. EXAMPLES 15 TO 22 General ProcedureI. Polyol Package master batch The ingredients making up the polyol package were combined in a 1 2 gallon container and mixed using a Cowles model 1 VG mixer under a blanket of nitrogen gas until the temperature reached 50 C. The container was tightly sealed and stored until use.II. Froth forming and testing The quantities of master batch and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate, indicated in Table II were added with mixing to a one pint jar so as to fill the jar to the 2 3 level. Mixing was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using a Mixmaster mixer set at the Beat whip setting maximum RPM s and containing the standard beaters supplied with the unit. The ingredients were mixed for 10 minutes. IfCatalyst A described in Example 1 was used, it was added to the froth at this point with a syringe, and the ingredients hand mixed for 30 seconds with a wooden spatula. The froth was transferred to a one ounce wax lined paper cup. The density of the froth was calculated and its gel time was measured. A portion of the froth was applied to a mold to determine post blow. The mold consisted of a 1 4 inch wide and 3 8 inch deep gap formed by two pieces of gypsum board attached to a plywood base. The postblow was measured in,a dry box, at room temperature humidity conditions as shown in Table II and in an environmental chamber at 26CC and 93 percent relative humidity. Post tlow was measured usinga micrometer and expressed in percent expansion of the cured froth over the depth of the original gap with 30 expansion the most acceptable amount of postblow. At about 30 expansion, however, the test samples are essentially monolithic to the naked eye.The other examples which show higher than 30,. expansion in the Table could be made accept able by use of more catalyst and or molecular sieves. It is recognized, however, in doing so the gel times would become very short and these situations would not be preferred.

However certain polyols are much more prone to the post blowing situation than others. Thus the tendency of the polyol to absorb water as measured by its hygroscopicity is also an important factor as can be seen by comparing Example 15 with 18 at a given humidity. Catalysis is also an important factor as can be seen by comparing examples 19 with 20 and 21 with 22. Post blow is decreased when catalyst is present because the gel times are correspondingly decreased which therefore decreases the time that the moisture sensitive isocyanate is present to react with water leading to the blowing reaction. Another way to decrease post blow is to include a moisture scavenger such as molecular sieves in the system.However we find that molecular sieves also exert a catalytic effect on the gelation reaction which would also be expected to reduce post blow. These e ffects are evident in combination by comparing the post blow data of Examples 15 with 16 and 17. Thus, Example 15 shows relatively high post blow even though catalyzed in the nventsnal manner because of the high polyol hygroscopicity and lack of moisture scavenger. Example 16 contains molecular sieves but less conventional catalyst than Example 15. In spite of the lower catalyst level Example 16 shows reduced post blow and a reduced gel time as well over Example 15. Example 17 also contains molecular sieves but a higher conventional catalyst level than Example 16. Post blow and gel time are reduced even further. The post blow values in Table II are higher than those shown in Table I because the samples were cured under conditions that maximize the post blowing phenomena. This was done to accentuate more clearly the differences between high and low post blow. A major reason for observing the higher post blow values shown for the Examples in Table II is that the molds used were constructed of gypsum board and wood which themselves contain water that is available for the post blowing reaction.
