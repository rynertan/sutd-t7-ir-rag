# Semiconductor integrated circuit devices.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device has memory cells 2 and decoder circuitry 3 disposed centrally thereof. A ground line 7 extends around the memory cells 2 and the decoder cir cuitry 3. Control circuits 41 to 46 are disposed beneath or outwardly of the ground line 7 . Signal lines 5 for connecting the control circuits to one another are disposed outwardly of the control circuits 41 to 46. A power line 6 is in turn disposed outwardly of the signal lines 5 . This layout can provide for a reduction in the number of bridges required.
