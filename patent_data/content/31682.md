# SLURRY CAST DOUBLE BASE PROPELLANTS

## Abstract
A slurry casting process is described capable of produ cing crosslinked double base propellant having improved burn ing rates and high specific impulse. Such propellants can be formulated to be smokeless. Improved burning rates are achieved by incorporating into a slurry of double base compo sition, casting powder granules containing 20 to 75 by weight of small particle ammonium perchlorate. The casting powder granules substantially retain their identity in the cured propellant matrix. The casting powder granules have a high burning rate and are uniformly distributed throughout the propellant. The granules are responsible for increasing the burning rate of the entire crosslinked double base propellant composition of the invention.
