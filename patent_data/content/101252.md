# A punch and winding machine.

## Abstract
An axial flux induction electric motor and method and apparatus for the production thereof, said motor 100 having a rotor 105 and stator 106 , each formed of a core 107, 113 consisting of metal strip 14 having holes 15 punched therein at longitudinally spaced locations so that holes 14 on the core 107, 113 form radially extending slots on a radial face of the core, and wherein said core 107, 113 has the radially inner two coils and the radially outer two coils fixed together by deformations 136, 134, 129, 130 thereby preventing unwinding of the core.
