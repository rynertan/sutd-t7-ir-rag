# Apparatus for the treatment of a gas, in particular air.

## Abstract
A method for the treatment of contaminated and preferably heated air, so that it obtains a purity necessary for re use and also a predetermined temperature and a predeter mined relative humidity, simultaneously making possible a diminution of heat consumption. The air A is conducted against and about a first contact surface 5 while injecting water 6 , as the case may be admixed with some additive, thereby separating out contaminations carried by the air and applying to the air a relative moisture of substantially 100 . The temperature of the air is lowered or raised by cooling or heating, respectively, via said contact surface, whereby the air attains a controlled temperature value B . Then, said controlled temperature value is adjusted to a final value at the passage by a dry but properly heated contact surface 11 , said air attaining the desired properly relative humidity C .
