# Optical system for ceiling mounted passive infrared sensor.

## Abstract
A ceiling mountable passive infrared intrusion detection system is disclosed having a mirror assembly providing a first protective curtain which is relatively narrow in the horizontal plane and which substantially encompasses the vertical space of a protected facility, and providing a second protective curtain which is relatively narrow in the vertical plane and which substantially encompasses 360 of horizon tal space of a protected facility. A temperature stabilized and shock insensitive infrared detector is disposed along the optical axis and at the focal point of the system to provide electrical signals in response to received radiation from the field of view of the protective curtains. The electrical signals are electronically processed to provide an output indication of intruder presence when in motion about both the floor area and the space between the floor area and the ceiling of a protected facility.
