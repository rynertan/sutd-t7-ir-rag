# Hinge connections for articulated vehicles.

## Abstract
A hinge connection 16 for an articulated vehicle having a front section 12 provided with two longitudinally spaced non driven axles 18, 20 and a rear section 14 provided with a single driven axle 26 includes a pair of hinge members 32, 34 which, together with a linkage mechanism 54 64, are con nected to a transversely extending shaft member 36 so as to provide angular movement of each section of the vehicle about a pair of mutually perpendicular axes while ensuring that the longitudinal center axis of the shaft member always bisects the angle between the front and rear sections when the vehicle is in a turn.
