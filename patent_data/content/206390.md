## Description
The present invention relates to an enzymatic detergent composition. More particularly it relates to an enzymatic detergent composition which contains a lipolytic enzyme. Enzymatic detergent compositions are well known in the art. Enzymes of many types have been proposed for inclusion in detergent compositions, but the main attention has been focussed on proteases and amylases. Although lipases have been mentioned as possible enzymes for detergent compositions, there is relatively little prior art directly concerned with lipases for detergent compositions in general. Thus, our British Patent Specification 1,372,034 discloses the use of lipases produced by microorganisms of the In British Patent Specifications 1,442,418 and 1,442,419 a two stage laundering process is described wherein a soaking step with a lipase containing liquor is followed by a washing step with a detergent containing wash liquor. In specification 1,442,419 the lipase containing liquor consisted of the claimed lipase s and a water soluble borax salt. Optional inclusion of conventional detergent surfactants or builders was mentioned but effectiveness in the presence of surfactants and builders was not demonstrated. In specification 1,442,418 the lipase containing liquor consisted of the claimed lipase s plus borax and Ca or Mg ions. Surfactants were again mentioned but again no evidence relating to effectiveness in surfactant solutions was provided. Builders which bind Ca and or Mg ions were specifically excluded in these pre wash liquors. Overall, the wash process described by these specifications needed two separate formulated products it was cumbersome and it would be of limited applicability in practice. In a more recent article in Journal of Applied Biochemistry, A recently published European patent application, N US A 3 950 277 Procter Gamble describes laundry pre soak compositions comprising lipase enzyme and isopropyl , methyl or butyl naphthalenesulphonate as lipase activator. Lipases from various mammalian, microbial and fungal sources are mentioned. DE A 19 32 981 Toyo Jozo KK describes a lipase from FR A 2 362 399 Eastman Kodak describes processes for hydrolysing triglycerides combined with proteins or as phospholipids, especially as these occur in biological fluids such as serum, and for the purposes of clinical chemistry, in the presence of surfactants. The above prior art thus teaches use of certain specific lipases in detergent compositions, or the formulation of specific detergent compositions and or washing steps including lipases therein. It is an aim of the present invention to provide lipase containing detergent compositions which have improved overall detergency performance and which show significant detergency improvements by the inclusion of lipases therein. We have now found that by including lipase from a certain class of lipases in a detergent composition which contains an anionic and a nonionic detergent active material, improved overall detergency can be achieved. In contrast with the above prior art, complete, lipase containing detergent compositions are provided by the present invention with which a normal washing process can be carried out, also at lower temperatures, whereby the benefits of the lipases are obtained without having to resort to special carefully selected deteregnt compositions or special washing or soaking steps, or without having to treat the fabrics for long periods with the lipase containing composition. The class of lipases to be used according to the present invention embraces lipases which show a positive immunological cross reaction with the antibody of the lipase producible by the micro organism The preparation of the antiserum is carried out as follows The serum containing the required antibody is prepared by centrifugation of clotted blood, taken on day 67. The titre of the anti Amano P lipase antiserum is determined by the inspection of precipitation of serial dilutions of antigen and antiserum according to the Ouchterlony procedure. A 25 dilution of antiserum was the dilution that still gave a visible precipitation with an antigen concentration of 0.1 mg ml. All lipases showing a positive immunological cross reaction with the Amano P antibody as hereabove described are lipases according to the present invention. Typical examples thereof are the Amano P lipase, the lipase ex Preferably, the lipases of the present invention should also show a positive immunological cross reaction with the antibody of one of the the following lipases lipase ex Typical examples of such lipases showing such further cross reaction are Amano P, Amano B, Amano CES, lipases ex The lipases of the present invention are included in the detergent composition in such an amount that the final detergent composition has a lipolytic enzyme activity of from 100 to 0.005 LU mg, preferably 25 to 0.05 LU mg of the composition. A Lipase Unit LU is that amount of lipase which produces 1µmol of titratable fatty acid per minute in a pH stat. under the following conditions temperature 30 C pH 9.0 substrate is an emulsion of 3.3 wt. of olive oil and 3.3 gum arabic, in the presence of 13 mmol Ca² and 20 mmol NaCl in 5 mmol Tris buffer. Naturally, mixtures of the above lipases can be used. The lipases can be used in their impurified form, or in a purified form, e.g. purified with the aid of well known adsorption methods, such as a phenylsepharose packed column technique. The detergent composition incorporating the lipases of the present invention contains as active detergent material a mixture of one or more nonionic synthetic detergent active materials and one or more anionic synthetic detergent active materials. Both types of detergent active materials are well known in the art, and suitable examples are fully described in Schwartz, Perry and Berch, Surface Active Agents and Detergents, Vol. I 1949 and Vol. II 1958 and in Schick, Nonionic Surfactants, Vol. I 1967 . In general, the weight ratio of the nonionic to the anionic detergent varies from 12 1 to 1 12, preferably from 8 1 to 1 8, and particularly preferably from 4 1 to 1 4. The amount of nonionic and anionic detergent active material together in the detergent composition ranges from 1 to 30 , usually 2 to 20 and preferably 6 to 16 by weight. Detergent materials of other types, such as soaps, cationic and zwitterionic detergents, may also be included. The detergent composition may furthermore include the usual detergent ingredients in the usual amounts. They may be unbuilt or built, and may be of the zero P type i.e. not containing phosphorus containing builders . Thus, the composition may contain from 1 45 , preferably from 5 30 by weight of one or more organic and or inorganic builders. Typical examples of such builders are the alkali metal ortho , pyro and tripolyphosphates, alkali metal carbonates, either alone or in admixture with calcite, alkali metal citrates, alkali metal nitrilotriacetates, carboxymethyloxysuccinates, zeolites, polyacetalcarboxylates and so on. Furthermore, it contains e.g. from 1 35 of a bleaching agent or a bleaching system comprising a bleaching agent and an activator therefor. In this respect it has been surprisingly found that the lipases of the present invention often are significantly less affected by the bleaching agent or bleaching system in the composition than other lipases, not according to the invention. The compositions may furthermore comprise lather boosters, foam depressors, anti corrosion agents, soil suspending agents, sequestering agents, anti soil redeposition agents, perfumes, dyes, stabilising agents for the enzymes and so on. They may also comprise enzymes other than lipases, such as proteases, amylases, oxidases and cellulases. In this respect it has surprisingly been found that, although the lipases of the present invention rapidly lose activity in the presence of proteases in clean model systems, under practical wash conditions in washing machines a substantial benefit is still delivered by the lipases in the presence of proteases. The compositions of the present invention can be formulated in any desired form, such as powders, bars, pastes or liquids. As said before, the compositions of the present invention show an improved overall detergency performance, particularly at lower temperatures. It is surprising that fully formulated detergent compositions incorporating the lipases of the present invention do show such an improved overall performance, when the prior art hitherto has indicated that lipases would only give some effect under particular conditions. The invention will now further be illustrated by way of Examples. With the following particulate detergent composition, washing experiments were carried out with several lipases The lipases tested were Amano P as described heretofore, furthermore SP 225, a lipase producible by The washing experiments were carried out under the following conditions The number of soil wash cycles was 4, and after the fourth wash the reflectance of the test cloths and the residual percentage of fatty material on the test cloths were determined. The reflectance was measured in a Reflectometer at 460 nm with a UV filter in the light pathway and the fatty matter by extracting the dried test cloths with petroleum ether, distilling off the solvent and weighing the resulting fatty matter. The following results were obtained These results show that the lipase of the present invention Amano P is superior to the other two prior art lipases. Replacing Amano P by Diosynth as heretofore described in Example I gave similar results. The lipase stability of various lipases in a bleach containing detergent composition 5 g l containing 3 TAED, 8 sodiumperboratemonohydrate and 0.3 Dequest was compared at 30 C in water of 22 GH. The balance of the formulation was equal to the one as described in Example VIII no Savinase or other proteolytic enzyme was present. The stability of the lipases was tested in clean wash liquors, using the detergent formulation of Example V with and without the bleaching system and or proteolytic enzymes. The water hardness was 22 GH. The following results were obtained The stability of lipases of the invention in bleach containing detergent formulations is further demonstrated. In these clean detergent solutions the sensitivity of the lipases to proteolytic attack is also shown. The performance in washing machines of Amano P in the presence of strong bleach 6 12 TAED perborate and high levels of a proteolytic enzyme Savinase 30GU ml was determined. The formulation of Example I was used at a water hardness of 8 GH and using the wash conditions given in Example I. Following results were obtained after the fourth wash These results showed that In the same manner as described in Example I, the lipase Amano P was compared with a lipase producible by The following results were obtained The lipase according to EP A 0130064 had a lipolytic activity of 90 LU mg, but also showed a proteolytic activity of 120 GU mg. Amano P does not show any detectable proteolytic activity. Although the effects of lipase ex Comparing in the manner as described in Example I the lipase Amano P with a lipase of the same manufacturer, not according to the invention, Amano CE, and with two otherlipases according to the invention, Amano B and Amano CES gave the following results The Amano CE lipase had an activity of 17 LU mg, but also showed a proteolytic activity of 16 GU mg. Amano P, Amano B and Amano CES had comparable LU mg activities, but do not show any detectable proteolytic activity. Again the good result on R ₄₆₀ but not on FM of Amano CE are explained by its contaminated proteolytic activity. With the following particulate detergent composition, furtherwashing experiments were carried out to show compatibility with bleach and proteolytic enzymes during the wash process. The washing experiments were carried out under the following conditions The following results were obtained after the fourth wash A similar experiment as in Example VIII was done using lipase according to the invention with different resistance against proteolytic enzymes as shown in Example IV. Lipase concentration was 5 LU ml. Residual activities in the wash liquor after the 30 minutes wash process Detailed comparison with Example IV shows that in the realistic, practical wash conditions used in this Example lipases of the invention are substantially less sensitive to attack by proteases such as Savinase used in detergent products. The test of Example 1 was repeated, but using 4 g l of the detergent composition and using lipases in an amount of 1 LU ml. The following results were obtained In the same manner as in Example I, washing experiments were carried out, using either 5 g l of the detergent composition of Example VIII water hardness 22 GH or 4 g l of the detergent composition of Example I water hardness 8 GH . The lipases were used at 1 and 3 LU ml. The test cloths were either polyester cotton P C mixed fabrics, or pre washed cotton PWC . The following results were obtained with the composition of Example I Repeating Example I, using the detergent composition of Example I at 4 g l in water of 8 GH, or the detergent composition of Example VIII at 5 g l in water of 22 GH, at various temperatures gave the following results In the manner as described in Example I, the following detergent compositions were tested. The following results were obtained
