# BRAKE ASSEMBLY FOR DENTAL TRAY SUPPORT ARM

## Abstract
A fluid actuated brake assembly 110 for use with a parallelogram linkage on a dental tray support arm 22 is described. Floating brake shoes 112,156 positioned on opposite sides of one member 26 of the parallelogram linkage with one of the brake shoes 112 pivotably and slidably attached to the other member 46 of the parallelo gram linkage provides a braking and locking effect between the two members 26,46 of the parallelogram linkage to provide an efficient brake for a dental tray support arm. Upon fluid actuation of the brake assembly, the brake shoes grip one member 26 of the parallelogram and form a rigid connection with the other member 46 of the parallelogram to prevent relative movement of the parallelogram linkage members.
