# Three dimensional integrated circuit.

## Abstract
In order to minimize the interconnections, there is prov ided a three dimensional integrated circuit fabricated on a semi insulating substrate of compound semiconductor mat erial comprising a first compound semiconductor layer formed on the surface of the semi insulating substrate and electrically connected to a variable voltage source, a second compound semiconductor layer formed on the surface of the first compound semi conductor layer opposite in conductivity type thereto and providing an electric device together with the first compound semiconductor layer, an undoped compound semiconductor layer epitaxially grown on the surface of the second compound semiconductor layer and formed with a plurality of doped regions for providing interconnections of the three dimensional integrated circuit, one of the inter connections providing an electric connections to the electric device formed with the first and second compound semi conductor layers, a doped compound semiconductor layer formed on the surface of the undoped compound semi conductor layer and capable of providing a current path es tablished therein, and a conductive layer formed on the sur face of the doped compound semiconductor layer and provid ing a gate to control the current path in the doped compound semiconductor layer, the conductive layer and the doped compound semiconductor layer forming parts of a field effect transistor which in turn forms part of the three dimensional integrated circuit together with the electric device.
