# Flame sprayed ferrous alloy enhanced boiling surface.

## Abstract
A porous boiling surface and method of making, which surface comprises a flame sprayed matrix of ferrous alloy powder on a metal substrate, the matrix being characterized by having irregularly spaced, angled micropores which extend partly through the thickness of the matrix and which improve the boiling performance of the surface.
