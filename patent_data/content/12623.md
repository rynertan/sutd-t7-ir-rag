# Colour reactive transfer material.

## Abstract
A transfer material comprising a carrier sheet, one face of which is provided with a coating of a composition comprising a colourless colour former and a waxy material in which the colour former is at least substantially soluble, an oily or fatty substance forming a transfer agent or mobiliser for causing transfer of the colour former from the carrier sheet to the face of a second or acceptor sheet caused to abut there against. By the application of mechanical pressure, the carrier sheet is pressed against such adjacent face, which latter is provided with an electron absorbing substance, so as to form a coloured marking. The transfer agent or mobiliser is wholly or partially encapsulated in micro capsules, the encapsulated transfer agent being provided on either one of, or both, said coated faces. Hence, at worst, the transfer agent is only minimally absorbed by the carrier sheet.

## Description
COLOUR REACTIVE TRANSFER ViATERIAL The present invention relates to colour reactive transfer materials of the type which comprises a carrier sheet coated on its rear face and containing a substantially colourless colour former which is adapted to react, under mechanical pressure with a so called colour acceptor which forms part of the front face coating of an adjacent second sheet located therebelow so as to form a coloured image of the latter. The rear face coating of the first sheet further comprises a waxy base layer which is solid at room temperature and oily and or fatty substances, which are known as transfer agents or mobilisers. In conventional transfer materials of this type, the colour former is generally dissolved in oil and encapsulated in microcapsules. By so doing, during storage and handling undesired reactions of the colourless colour former with the colour acceptor on the abutting sheet are prevented. Micro capsules are, however, somewhat expensive to prepare and use. In order, therefore, to avoid the use of such microcapsules, it is aiready known to use colour formers which are soluble in the wax components of the composition applied to the rear face layer of the carrier sheet, but which are insoluble in the oily or greasy components thereof. This is disclosed inGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. P 2747899.5. This proposal effectively prevents undesired colour reactions from occurring.However, in colour transfer materials of this type, there is a tendency for the oily components the transfer agents or mobilisers to be absorbed into the carrier sheet due to the limited oil retention capacity of the wax components. This, in turn, delays the transfer caused by the application of pressure to the backing layer and hence the colour reaction between the colour former and the acceptor. The present invention seeks to provide a transfer material of this general type in which the disadvantages mentioned hereinbefore are minimized. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a colour reactive transfer material comprising a sheet or web of carrier material, one face of said sheet or web being provided with a coating comprising a colourless colour former which is capable, by the application of mechanical pressure thereto, of forming a coloured marking on the face of a second or acceptor sheet or web caused to abut thereagainst the second sheet or web having, on said abutting face, a surface coating of a colour acceptor including an electron accepting material or substance, the coating on the carrier material further comprising a waxy material which is solid at room temperature and in which the colour former is at least substantially soluble, a transfer agent being provided for causing the transfer of the colour former from the backing sheet or web to the second sheet or web characterised in that the transfer agent is at least partially encapsulated in pressure sensitive micro capsules, the encapsulated transfer agent being provided on either one of, or both, said coated faces.By so doing, the migration of the transfer agent or mobiliser into the first or carrier sheet is at least substantially reduced compared with known systems and may even be completely prevented. The number of micro capsules required is much lower than in conventional transfer materials in which both the colour former and the mobiliser are enclosed in micro capsules. Because of the separation of the colour former from the transfer agent or mobiliser achieved by using a transfer material in accordance with the present invention, the transfer agent or mobiliser may, if desired, also constitute a solvent for the colour former. In such.a case, an acceleration of the reaction speed occurs and or if desired, a reduction in the number of micro capsules required per unit area or both of these effects may be produced. If, as is one possibility according to the present invention, the encapsulated transfer agent is provided in the coating of the second or acceptor sheet, a further improvement of the speed of reaction between the colour reactants after the pressure has been applied and a prevention of migration of the transfer agent into the base material usually paper , can be achieved. This is because part of the transfer agent is isolated from the rest of the transfer agent. In such a case, the portion of the encapsulated transfer agent in the second sheet is prevented from migrating into the base material and the separation of the encapsulated transfer agent from the colour former makes it possible to use an organic solvent for the colour former and or the colour former containing waxy material as a constituent of the transfer agent.This will again result in an increased reaction rate between the colour reactants or in a further reduction of the number of micro capsules required per unit area, or both of these effects may be produced. We have found that if the coating of the second or acceptor sheet contains 5 4o by weight, preferably 10 15 ó by weight, of transfer agent encapsulated in microcapsules and or organic solvent clearly improved transfer properties compared with known wax based transfer materials are achieved. The micro capsules are relatively small, that is to say, they desirably have a size of from 4 to 8 microns. They preferably comprise resins such as polyacrylates or polyamides.The capsules may be produced from an aqueous medium and, in such a case, may be made ready for use in powder form by, for example, spray drying.
