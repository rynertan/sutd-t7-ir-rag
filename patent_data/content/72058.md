# Multiple compartment syringe.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a syringe for injecting two or more injection liquids which may not be in contact with each other for a longer period of time, comprising a barrel having a piston, a needle on the front side of the barrel, a sealing stopper in the barrel on the front and one or more separating stoppers which, before use of the syringe, keep the injection liquids separated from each other. The needle is connected to the front of the barrel by means of a needle holder comprising a collar to connect the needle holder to the barrel, a neck to connect the injection needle, and a hollow shaft between collar and neck, in which a passage is formed in the inner wall of the shaft and the rear face of the neck, past which passage the injection liquids can reach the cannula when during use of the syringe the stoppers are moved into the shaft of the needle holder.
