# A SPHERICALLY SHAPED SWITCH ASSEMBLY OAND APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FORMING SAME

## Abstract
A spherically shaped membrane switch assembly 10 for attaching to generally spherical surfaces such as cathode ray tubes 12 is disclosed. Also disclosed are a method and apparatus for forming layers of flexible film used in the assembly 10. The assembly is comprised of two layers 20, 22 of transparent film having spaced apart conductors 28 on the internal surfaces 24, 26 of both layers 20, 22 . The internal surfaces 24, 26 are separated by spacing means 32 , the spacing means 32 being discontinuous at the switch sites 30 . The conductors 28 on the two layers 20, 22 cross and are spaced apart at the switch sites 30 . The layers of the assembly 10 are spherically formed to the same radius as the spherical surface on which the assembly 10 is to be mounted. The assembly layers are formed by placing at least one film layer between two parallel retaining layers 122, 124 of thermoplastic film. The retaining layers 122, 124 are held between convex and concave surfaces while heat is applied to at least one of the retaining layers until the assembly layer attains the desired spherical shape. The assembly 10 mounts flush to the spherical surface and conforms uniformly to its surface thus reducing distortion and parallax.
