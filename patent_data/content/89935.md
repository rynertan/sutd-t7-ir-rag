## Description
AN APPLICATOR DEVICE. The present invention relates to an applicator, preferably for in line labelling of objects transported by a conveyor system. Modern handling of goods, for instance in packing lines, necessitates components and sub systems of high performance type in the handling system. Frequently, it is called for an easy adjustment to various package sizes, an easy but reliable operation, an easy maintenance, etc. Of course, at the same time it is called for a reasonable cost. An essential unit of the goods handling system frequently is some kind of marking device which by applying a label provides the goods, the packages, etc. with visual and or machine readable information related to contents, weight, price, etc. There is a great variety of label applicator devices, but to day there is lacking at an optimum simple and reliable device that allows in line labelling of objects of various sizes. In order to obviate said lack the present invention suggests an applicator of the actual type which is characterized by a device that supports an applicator head for movement from and to a position for fetching a second object, for instance a label, said device being such that it provides an applicator head movement comprising a component of movement in the transport direction of the objects as well as in the opposite direction, and allows an automatic object related hight positioning of the head above the actual transport plane. For this object the applicator preferably is supported in a pendulum arm which allows swinging movement in a plane oriented in the transport direction and generally perpendicular to the transport plane, in a direction generally perpendicular to the transport direction as well as in the transport direction. Preferably, the applicator head by two arms pivoted in a joint is supported for swinging movement around a fixed point of suspension of the pendulum arm system. The driving of the pendulum arm system suitably is accomplished by a crank web pivoted in the arm between the applicator head and said joint and fixedly mounted to a rotatable disc. In order to accomplish the automatic hight positioning, the movement of the crank web is arranged to follow automatically the height positioning of the applicator head. The applicator head hight positioning related adjustment of the crank web is realized by arranging the rotatable disc displaceable, preferably pendulum displaceable with a vertical component of movement. The vertical pendulum displacement of the disc is accomplished by a slewing bracket connecting the disc to a fixed joint. Via the crank web and the arm pivoted thereto, the slewing bracket preferably maintains the applicator head in a position corresponding to a minimum height of the objects via biasing means, for instance a tension spring, positively acting on the slewing bracket. In said position the rotatable disc suitably is maintained positively in its lowest vertical position, for instance by abutment against a stop of the end of the slewing bracket journalled in the disc. The rotatable disc preferably is driven via a transmission from a driving device which gives the applicator a motion in synchronism with the objects, for instance by a sensor controlling the driving device in terms of the speed of the conveyor. The relation between the lenghts of the lever arms and the position of the joint joints is such that the applicator head is given a horisontal movement of sufficient lenght for the actual purpose the path of movement might broadly conform to an ellipse having a horisontal major axis. The means for driving of the applicator suitably also accomplish a movement such that the movement of the appli cator head to and from the fetching position will be timed relative the other object in said position such that said other object already is located in the fetching position when the applicator arrives. The invention will now be exemplified and elucidated further in the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, whereFigure 1 schematically shows part of a line where the app licator according to the invention is included,Figure 2 shows the basic diagram of movement of the appli cator, andFigure 3 shows a practical embodiment of the elements for accomplishing the movement. The reference numeral 10 generally denotes a conveyor system comprising an input conveyor 101 to a weighing machine 102 provided with a weighing conveyor 103 and an output conveyor 104. In a position above the conveyor system 10, which in the present case is oriented horisontally, there is a label printing and label output device 105. In Figure 2 it is shown how a label 14 is located in an output position corresponding to the fetching position of an applicator head 13. The applicator head is supported in a pendulum arm system 11, 12 which allows a composite swinging movement 17, 18 in a plane generally perpendicular to the transport plane 16, along which the parcels, packages 26 are forwarded horisontally in the direction of the arrow 15. The plane of the swinging movement is oriented in the transport direction 15, and a first swinging movement 17 is possible along the arc that has been indicated, while a second swinging movment is indicated by the positions 18 of the applicator head . The pendulum system is arranged such that there is a fixed fulcrum 19 and a movable joint 20 between the two pendulum arms 11, 12. A disc for instance a cog belt wheel 22 has a crank web 21 fixed thereto. The crank web is journalled in the arm 12. The disc is rotatable by a transmission 25 driven by a driving motor. The applicator head describes the swinging movement 18 under the action from the crank web 21 the end of which moves along the broken circle periphery 36 and the movable joint 20 gives the swinging movement 17. The reference numeral 32 indicates that the disc 22 is displaceable with a component of movement in the vertical direction. Said displacement is automatic and is obtained positively by the contact of the applicator head with a parcel, package, etc. A more complete and practical embodiment of the suspension system of the applicator head appears from Figure 3.The pendulum arm 11 is here a fork arm journalled in the horizontal shaft 19. The fixed attachment of the crank web 21 to the disc cog belt wheel 22 is accomplished through a further fork arm or slewing bracket 29 journalled onto a fixed horisontal shaft 28. The pendulum arm 12 is located between the two arms of the fork 29. In the embodiment disclosed, the disc 22 is a cog belt disc driven by a cog belt 25 from a motor 27 via a transmission gear 34. The fork arm 29 is kept in a starting position bottom position by a spring 30 and in this position the arm 29 abuts a stop 31. As an alternative to a tension spring vacuum assistance might be possible. The length of the horisontal phase of movement is selected by a feasible relation between the length of the pendulum arms and the location of the joints. The driving speed of the motor 27 is adjusted automatically to the speed of the output conveyor, for instance by a sensor not shown that senses the conveyor speed and controls the speed of the motor in relation thereto such that the speed of the applicator head coincides with the conveyor speed. Preferably, the label 13 is lifted against the applicator by the blower ortpiece 35. The timing of the supply of labels is such that a label 13 already might be in the fetching position when the return stroke of the applicator head 13 is terminated. This gives the system a high capacity potential without extreme mechanical speeds.
