## Description
The present invention relates to a decubital ulcer remedy which contains ubidecanorene as an effective or active ingredient. Namely, this invention is directed to a novel utility of ubidecanorene as a pharmaceutical product. It is useful for the treatment of decubitus ulcer in the therapeutic field. Decubitus ulcer is ischemic necrosis of the skin or subcutaneous tissue caused at a projected bone area due to continuous pressure. It is a problem annoying many patients who suffer from chronic diseases, especially, such as patients of cancers and lesions of cerebral vessels. Depending on causes, decubitus ulcer may be roughly divided into paralytic decubitus ulcer and non paralytic decubitus ulcer. The former is induced by damage to the spinal cord, ulcer, infection or degenerative disease. The latter is developed in aged patients confined to their beds over long periods of time, and also from chronic anemia and malnutrition, or compression from a plaster after a fracture. For the prevention or treatment of decubitus ulcer, it is practiced to change the position of a patient or to release one or more pressed areas of the patient from pressure so that his skin is protected from continuous compression. It is also practiced to use a special bed making use of a good hygroscopic cushioning material and to effect rigorous skin cleaning and wiping, thereby ensuring to keep the skin dry for the prevention of secondary infection. Furthermore, it is also practiced to improve and control the nutrition or to treat anemia with high protein and high calorie diet. Where the condition of decubitus ulcer is extremely serious, surgery is effected to resect the decubital part and then to restore the resulting lost part by sutured minification, adjacent flap or distant flap. Decubitus ulcer however still remains as a hardly curable and difficult skin disease, resulting in long and severe pain to patient. With the foregoing in view, the present inventors have carried out various investigations with a view toward achieving the treatment of decubitus ulcer by administration of drugs. As disclosed in the following publications 1 and 2 , the present inventors previously used ubidecanorene on a trial basis for the treatment of radiation dermatitis or radiation ulcers, leading to recognition of the superb effectiveness of ubidecanorene. It was of course impossible to foresee if ubidecanorene would show similar significant effects to decubitus ulcer, because decubitus ulcer is different in cause and condition from radiation dermatitis or radiation ulcers. The present inventors have proceeded with further investigations. As a result, it has been found that significant curative results can be obtained by direct coating application of ubidecanorene to areas affected by decubitus ulcer, leading to completion of this invention. This invention thus provides a decubital ulcer remedy suitable for cutaneous administration, which comprises ubidecanorene as an effective ingredient. The decubital ulcer remedy of this invention, which may preferably take the form of a cream, lotion or ointment, is effective in reducing decubitus related severe pain and restoring the tissue damaged by decubitus ulcer. The above and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claim. The term decubitus ulcer as used herein should be interpreted in a broad sense. Described in brief, it means ischemic necrosis of the skin or subcutaneous tissue caused at a projected bone area due to continuous pressure. Ubidecanorene is also called ubiquinontene or coenzyme Q₁₀ . Ubidecanorene which has conventionally been used as a therapeutic agent for congestive heart failure is also used in the present invention. Ubidecanorene is extracted from the mitochondria of bovine heart muscle and is known to take part in the electron transport system. Ubidecanorene can therefore improve the percent oxygen utilization in heart muscle and hence maintain the ATP yielding function at a high level even if the heart muscle is in an ischemic state. As a result, ubidecanorene is known to reduce the damage, which the ischemic cardiac muscular tissue undergoes, and to improve the diastole of the heart construction function. However, the fact that decubitus ulcer can be effectively cured with cutaneously applied ubidecanorene has been unknown to date. It has been found for the first time by the present inventors. Ubidecanorene is crystalline powder of a yellow or orange color, the melting point of which is 48 52 C. It is oil soluble but is scarcely soluble in water or methanol. As described above, it has been orally administered in order to improve various symptoms of congestive heart failure. For the sake of reference, its subacute toxicity and chronic toxicity upon its oral administration are as follows Subacute toxicity Ubidecanorene was continuously and orally administered to male and female Wistar rats at doses of 40, 200 and 1,000 mg kg day for 5 weeks and to male and female rabbits at doses of 60 and 600 mg kg day for 23 days. Neither rats nor rabbits developed any difference compared with their respective controls in general conditions, blood test, urine test and morphological observation both visual and histological . Ubidecanorene was forcedly and orally administered to male and female Wistar rats at doses of 6, 60 and 600 mg kg day for a period of 26 weeks. The present invention features cutaneous administration of ubidecanorene to an area where decubitus ulcer, defined as described above in the present invention, has been developed. Upon cutaneous administration, ubidecanorene may be applied directly. It is however desirable to apply it as a preparation suitable for skin coating if possible. Ubidecanorene may be administered along with one or more other drugs, for example, cytchrome c or urokinase. It should however be borne in mind that the present invention is not necessarily limited to or by such a combined administration. As the content of ubidecanorene in the remedy of this invention, there may be recommended 0.05 5.0 with 0.1 2.0 being preferable. The remedy may be coated in an amount suitable depending on the size and severity of each decubitus affected area. Ubidecanorene shows good stability upon its cutaneous administration and gives low irritation to the skin. Table 1 shows, by way of example, results of various tests of ubidecanorene on primary cutaneous irritation, cumulative irritation, blepharo irritation, phototoxicity, challenge and optical challenge as well as results of its patch test. To form ubidecanorene into a preparation suitable for its cutaneous administration, one or more suitable low irritant bases may be chosen as ingredient s other than ubidecanorene and then mixed with ubidecanorene. For example, glycerin, squalane, cetyl alcohol, yolk phospholipid or the glyceryl ester of a fatty acid may be chosen. They may then be formulated into a preparation for cutaneous administration by a method known Having generally described this invention, a further understanding caN be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purpose of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. The above proportioned ingredients were mixed by a method known The above proportioned ingredients were mixed by a method known The above proportioned ingredients were mixed by a method known The above proportioned ingredients other than the purified water were formed into a homogeneous solution while heating same. The resulting solution was maintained at about 60 C, and was then poured with stirring into the purified water which had beforehand been heated to the same temperature. They were stirred into an intimate mixture and then cooled to room temperature, thereby preparing a ubidecanorene containing lotion as a remedy of this invention. The above proportioned ingredients were mixed by a method known Effects of this invention will hereinafter be described by certain case reports. The effectiveness of the present invention was tested with respect to patients who had been admitted to the Radiology Department or the Circulatory Organ and Internal Department and were unable to change their positions by themselves due to their exhaustion from terminal cancers or severe lesions of cerebral vessels. Their life prognoses were absolutely hopeless. As a matter of fact, three out of the four cases resulted in death in 2 3 days or 4 months subsequent to the test. As a sample remedy of this invention, an ointment containing 0.5 of ubidecanorene was used. The treatment was effected by sterilizing each decubitus ulcer affected area with Hibiten or Pyrozosin and then coating the ointment there. 37 Years old male. After surgery of a right seminoma, it transferred to the brain and orchiectomy was performed. The seminoma contained embryonal cells and was hence a high malignancy seminoma from the morphological viewpoint. In spite of postorchioctomical radiation, the cancer transferred subsequently to the peritoneum, lungs and brain. Acute decubitus ulcer occurred in the course of radiotherapy of the metastasized brain. He was unable to change his position by himself because he was also suffering from disturbance of consciousness. Decubitus ulcer developed at the sacrum. In three days after the initiation of treatment with the ubidecanorene ointment, severe pain and erythema were both reduced and crust was formed, in other words, a promising sign of cure was observed. Three days later, the decubitus ulcer was cured completely. 69 Years old male. Due to recurrence of kidney cancer after its surgery, no further operation was feasible although its intraperitoneal dilatation was confirmed by celiotomy. Radiotherapy was applied in order to lighten severe pain at the lumboabdominal area. Infiltrated stomach wall was also confirmed as a result of a stomachal endoscopic test. His clinical conditions aggravated due to hematemesis and fast, followed by development of decubitus ulcer at the sacrum. Immediately, its treatment was started by applying the ubidecanorene ointment there. The curing effect was remarkable and a promising sign of improvement was recognized shortly. However, the patient died 3 days later due to the original disease. 84 Years old male. After radiochemotherapy of esophagus cancer, the cancer transferred to the right cervix area. The right cervix area was subjected to radiochemotherapy which employed hyperthermia in combination. One year later, ulcer was formed at the right cervix area. Although it was not cancer in nature, he believed that it was recurrence of the cancer. In despair, he became apositic. Since decubitus ulcer was developed at the sacrum, coating of the ubidecanorene ointment was started. It was steadily improved to complete cure. 84 Years old male. He developed disturbance of consciousness subsequent to cerebral infarct. Upon an elapsed time of half a year after the cerebral infarct, decubitus ulcer concentrating in the lower right back was observed. In spite of its treatment through coating of conventional therapeutic agents over 3 months, the condition was not improved. When treatment was started by using the ubidecanorene ointment of this invention, a deep ulcer had already been formed and necrosic skin fragments remained as crust. When its treatment was started by coating the ubidecanorene ointment there, supply of blood took place promptly to start curing the ulcer. It was however observed that tissue components of necrosic skin fragments still remained there, coupled by Decubitus ulcer is necrosis of a tissue caused by a hemokinetic disturbance. As demonstrated in the above case reports, the reduction of severe pain and restoration of tissue can be both obtained by coating with the ubidecanorene ointment. It has thus been found that the ointment, cream or lotion therapy, which makes use of ubidecanorene, exhibits superb effects. The following three advantages may be mentioned as major advantages of the ointment, cream or lotion therapy. The above mentioned three features have extremely important significance for the treatment of decubitus. Namely, when decubitus ulcer is induced, hemokinetic disturbance is generally associated with it. Corollary to this, remarkable curing effects are usually unavailable even when its treatment is attempted by way of hemokinesis, for example, by oral administration or injection of a therapeutic drug. Oral administration is by itself difficult to perform especially when decubitus ulcer has been developed in the course of long term treatment of a disease accompanied disturbance of consciousness. It is here that ubidecanorene has the important significance, because the treatment of decubitus ulcer can be achieved by a simple external application of ubidecanorene. The outstanding clinical usefulness of this invention can be readily appreciated when one takes into consideration the fact that more and more patients of terminal cancers or neuraxial disorder are suffering from decubitus ulcer reflecting the increase in actual number of such patients. It has also been confirmed through an additional investigation that the present invention can also exhibit sufficient preventive effects by its application when erythema has been induced and decubitus ulcer is about to occur. Accordingly, the usefulness of the present invention has also been confirmed in connection with prevention of decubitus ulcer. It has also been found preferable to perform effective disinfection or sterilization to the affected skin, to use a histolytic agent in combination and or to resect the affected skin, since skin infection, especially, skin necrsis with remaining myofilaments gives adverse influence in drawing the curing effects of ubidecanorene.
