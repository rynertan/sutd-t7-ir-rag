## Description
CORE MEMBER FOR PLATEN ROLL The present invention relates to a core member for a platen roll used for instance in an office printer, copier, typewriter, or the like. Recently, along with the development of hard aluminium alloys and progress in the extrusion forming art for such alloys, it has been possible to produce platen core members both of a light weight and a high degree of core accuracy. As an example, such a platen roll is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,453,848. Such a known form of platen core member comprises a hub part of circular cross section, an outer tube part, and three equi spaced webs extending between the hub and tube parts, so defining three hollow spaces. The core member is cut to an appropriate length, and then the outer tube part and webs are cut away to expose lengths of the hub part at each end, which are then machined as required to form supporting axles. When such a roll is used, it has the disadvantage that it is rather noisy. Each time the roll is struck, the sound generated reverberates within the hollow spaces bound by the hard smooth extruded aluminium alloy, and so such a construction is not particularly favoured. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a platen roll which is significantly less noisy in use than the construction described above. According to this invention therefore, a platen roll core member comprising an axle hub, an external tube part concentric with the axle hub, and webs interconnecting the hub and tube parts is characterised by the provision of a plurality of projections extending in the axial direction on one or both of the outer circumferential surface of the axle hub and the inner circumferential surface of the tube part. It will be appreciated that the provision of axially extending projections within the hollow spaces of the platen roll core member serves greatly to damp the reflections of sound waves within those spaces, so reducing the noise generated when a platen incorporating such a core member is used. The reflections of sound may be reduced or damped further by providing fins of an appropriate shape on the webs. Further improvements in noise reduction may be achieved by appropriate selection of the material from which the core member is made, and such a selection may also give rise to economic advantages, too. Preferably, the core member is made from an aluminium alloy or a sintering material, such as alumina or the like, though the core member could be made from a synthetic resin or a compound material such as a synthetic resin reinforced with materials such as carbon fibres or the like. By way of example only, certain specific embodiments of this invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows part of a known design of platen roll construction Figure 2 shows a cross section through the platen roll of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a side view of an embodiment of a core member of a platen roll according to the present invention Figure 4 is a cross sectional view taken through the roll of Figure 3 and Figures 5, 6, 7 a and 7 b are all cross sectional views of different embodiments of core member, all according to the present invention. Figures 1 and 2 show a platen roll of the prior art, and this as shown in Figure 1, and this comprises a platen roll core member 1 formed by extruding a hard aluminium alloy, and a rubber cover layer 2 which lies over the external circumferential surface of the core member 1. In cross section, the shape of the platen roll core member has an axle part 1a, an external tube part 1b and three equi spaced webs 1c which interconnect the external tube part 1b and the axle part 1a. The external tube part 1b and the webs 1c at the ends of a length of the core member 1 are cut away and removed, to expose the axle part 1a at both ends, these then being machined to form an assembly axle part 3. In this way, the platen roll shown in the drawings is produced. Since the platen roll core member 1 having its external tube part 1b, the axle part 1a and the webs 1c formed integrally beforehand by an extrusion forming process, it has the advantage that accuracy is enhanced and yet the weight thereof can be reduced as it is made of hard aluminium alloy. On the other hand, it has the drawback that a platen roll having such a core member 1, is very noisy in use. This is because the sound generated on striking the outer surface of the roll reverberates within the hollow regions of the core member. Figure 3 is a side view of an embodiment of a platen roll core member according to the present invention, and Figures 4 to 7 show various possible cross sections for that platen roll core member, all in accordance with the present invention. The platen roll core member 10 is formed by extruding a sintering material such as alumina, or the like, thus forming a core body 11 of a tubular shape. After completing the extrusion, axle parts 12 are fitted at both ends and the core member is completed by sintering. Each design of platen roll core member 10 is integrally formed in such a manner that its core body 11 comprises axle hub 13 having an axle hole 13a, an external tube part 14 concentrically formed with the axle hub 13, and webs 15 which connect the external tube part 14 with the axle hub 13 at three equi spaced positions. In the platen roll core member 11 of the embodiment shown in Figure 4, there is a number of projections 16 each of a trapezoidal cross sectional shape and extending in the axial direction, these being integrally formed around the inner circumferential surface of the external tube part 14 with uniform spacings therebetween in the circumferential direction.In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, projections 17 of a triangular shape and extending in the axial direction are also integrally formed around the circumferential surface of the axle hub 13, with uniform spacing therebetween in the circumferential direction. The embodiment shown in Figure 6 has the above mentioned projections 16 formed in a triangular shape, rather than the trapezoidal cross sectional shape of Figure 3, and also has the projections 17 formed as arcuate projections. It will be appreciated that the above mentioned projections 16 and 17 are not limited to the particular shapes illustrated in the drawings. Also, as shown in Figures 7 a and 7 b , fins 18 may be integrally provided on the webs 15. As has been explained above, the platen roll core member body 11 according to the present invention has a plurality of projections extending in the axial direction and integrally formed on either both of or one of the external surfaces of the axle hub 13 and the internal surface of the external tube part 14. As a result, striking sounds generated as the platen roll core member is struck externally make irregular reflections within the cavity of the core member 10, by virtue of the above mentioned projections, and so are absorbed or damped. When fins 18 are provided on the webs 15, as shown in Figure 7, the irregular reflections of the striking sounds are increased, thus further improving the sound reducing effect. Furthermore, when the core member 10 is formed from a porous sintering material, the sound reducing effect is even yet further improved. A further advantage is that by forming the platen roll core member 10 using a sintering material such as alumina, or the like, and then assembling the axle parts 12 to be integrally connected at both ends of the member body 11 upon sintering to complete the body, such secondary fabrications as cutting and so on become unnecessary. The core member thus is economical to manufacture. While the core member body 11 and the assembled axle parts 12 are integrally formed in the above mentioned embodiment, separate axle part 12 formed for instance of steel or aluminium, may be inserted into both ends of the core member body 11, after the body has been sintered. The core member 10 of the above mentioned embodiment has been described as being made using a sintering material such as alumina, as the raw material, to secure a sound damping effect by virtue of the material itself, and to reduce the unit cost of production. However, synthetic resins such as polyacetal, polycarbonate, polymide, fluororesin, or the like may be used to form a platen roll of this invention, for example by an injection moulding process. Alternatively, a platen roll core member may be formed from a compound material which combines such synthetic resins and a reinforcing material as metallic fibres, carbon fibres or the like. With a platen core member according to the present invention, the striking sounds generated as the core member of the platen roll is externally struck are damped by the projections, so that a sound prevention effect is obtained, by the absorbtion or damping of the sound. Also, the use of an inexpensive sintering material, synthetic resin or compound material combining a synthetic resin and a reinforcing material can be used as the raw material for the core member, leads to the reduction in the cost of the product.
