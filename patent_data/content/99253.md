# Micro electrodes and the production thereof.

## Abstract
An improved micro electrode comprises a tapering capillary tube in which the wide end is preferably of outside diameter 2 mm or less, a conductive filament, preferably of outside diameter 50 Âµm or less, an outer lead wire and an insulating resin filler which is packed into the cavity of the capillary tube. There is a direct connection between the conductive filament and the outer lead wire in the cavity of the capillary tube. The production method may include the step of threading the conductive filament into the tapering capillary tube so that the tip of the filament projects from the thin end of the capillary tube after filling at least part of the cavity of the capillary tube with a volatile solvent to facilitate such threading.
