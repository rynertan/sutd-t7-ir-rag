# MODIFIED POLYPROPYLENE FOR FILM

## Abstract
An improved polypropylene blend for biaxial orientation into thin films is made by combining low melt flow polypro pylene, a nucleating agent, and linear low density polyethy lene in a pelletizing extruder. Preferably, the low melt flow polypropylene is formed by cracking a lower melt flow poly propylene with a peroxide agent.
