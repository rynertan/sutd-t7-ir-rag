# Protective covering for magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
Magnetic recording medium protected by an ultra thin, composite low surface energy covering provided by an inner layer of insoluble polymer and an outer layer of insoluble poly mer which are made by in situ polymerization. The inner layer is made from two monomers such as a hydantoin hexacrylate and alpha methyl styrene. The outer layer is made from poly merizable perfluoropolyether monomer having ethylenicaly unsaturated polymerizable groups. The composite low surface energy covering is especially useful for providing lubricity and corrosion resistance to a metallic thin film magnetic recording coating.
