# Clutch release mechanism.

## Abstract
A clutch release mechanism permitting a center fulcrum type release fork to be installed or removed under such condi tion that a clutch housing is fixed to a cylinder block, so as to simplify installation of the release fork in a production step and also simplify subsequent exchange of the release fork. The clutch release mechanism comprises a release fork having a pair of forked arms and adapted to be inserted from a fork inser tion hole formed through a part of a clutch housing and mount ed to a bearing hub of a clutch release bearing in a direction per pendicular to an axis of the bearing hub so as to be interlocked with the bearing hub, a fulcrum pin fixed to base portions of the forked arms of the release fork at both ends thereof, and a fork support fixed to an inside wall of the clutch housing for rotat ably supporting the fulcrum pin.
