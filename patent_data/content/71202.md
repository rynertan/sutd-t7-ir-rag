# Method and apparatus for optically inspecting a moving web of glass.

## Abstract
An automatic optical inspection of a moving web of glass for defects is provided by transversely scanning a moving web of glass 20 with a light beam 14 which is internally reflected within the glass and travels towards the edge of the glass when the scanning light beam 14 strikes defects within the web. The light leaving the edges of the glass as a result of internal reflection is captured on opposite edges of the web. The captured light is detected and converted to electrical signals which are utilized to determine whether defects are present in the web. An apparatus 10 is provided for the inspection method which includes edge detectors 30 having a mouthlike construction fitting over the edges of the web and collecting internally reflected radiation from the edges of the web, only, and applying it to photomultiplier tubes which are cooled. The edge detectors are enslaved mechanically so as to follow the movements of the web.
