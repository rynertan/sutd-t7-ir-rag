# Fluid handling devices such as filters and lubricators and containers therefor.

## Abstract
A fluid container, e.g. in an air filter or lubricator, has a metal bowl 10 with a sight glass comprising a light transmitting member 12 of elongate tapered form. The sight glass member 12 is slidable into a complementary tapered slot or recess 24 defined by a flange 20 inte gral with the bowl and overlying a flat wall portion 16 provided with apertures 38, 40 the main volume of the bowl and the space between said wall portion and the member 12 adjacent top and bottom regions of the mem ber respectively. The container depends from a body 2 of the filter or lubricator and is releasably attached thereto by lugs 48 on the bowl 10 resting upon lugs 50 on the body. Projections 66, 68 on the lugs 48 determine direction and extent to which the bowl 10 can be rotated relative to the body 2 when attaching or detach ing it, and prevent relative rotation when the filter or lubri cator is in use.
