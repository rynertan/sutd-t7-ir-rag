# Pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A pressure transducer for providing an output signal having a value determined by an input pressure differential includes a capacitance manometer 10 having a first input 24 for receiving a first input pressure and a second input 25 for receiving a second input pressure, the capacitance manometer 10 having a capacitance determined by the difference between the first and second input pressures, and an output circuit connected to the capacitance manometer 10 for providing an output signal having a value dependent upon the capacitance.
