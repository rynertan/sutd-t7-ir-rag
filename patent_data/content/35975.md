# Sheet material guiding means.

## Abstract
An apparatus for storing or processing sheet material is described. There are present in the entry chute several pairs of wheels of equal circumference mounted fixedly on free running axles which are transverse to the path of travel of the sheet material. The rims of the wheels are covered in rubber. As the sheet material comes into contact with the wheels, the wheels guide the film sheet in a straight path.
