## Description
LOW STEAM CONSUMPTION PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF UREA The invention concerns a process having a low steam consumption for the manufacture of urea. Improvements to urea manufacturing plants have allowed, until now, to lower the steam consumption from 1500 to 1000 kg per ton of urea or, in the most efficient case, 550 600 kg t U.S patent 4,208,347 deals with a new, double loop process I.D.R. process , but describes only the high pressure loop and does not take into account the final, low pressure, unit the so called finishing . The Applicant see New process gives urea with less energy Hydrocarbon Processing, Nov. 1982 . has later described an I.D.R.complete manufacturing line, finishing included, comprising a high pressure loop reactor, two subsequent isobaric strippers and a carbamate condenser and a finishing comprising I a medium pressure still 20 30 ata , the vapors of which are condensed within a vacuum concentrator, substan tially at 0.35 ata see item II , thus realizing a multiple effect evaporation, and a low pressure still, working substan tially at 5 ata atmospheres, absolute II a two step vacuum concentration section respectively and approximately at 0.35 and 0.05 ata and one unit for the recovery of NH3 from the reaction waters and from the scrub ber waters coming from the washing of the synthesis vent. The steam consumption of the complete I.D.R. line is slightly lower than 600 kg t and the Applicant has foreseen a further decrease to 500 kg t. The present invention concerns an improved process for the manufacture of urea, which process allows to lower considerably, in a new and original way, the steam consumption of said I.D.R. line i.e. the high pressure loop and the finishing unit of the present invention were matched in an original way, so as to improve synergistlcally and therefore surprisingly the whole I.D.R. line, while lowering the outside steam requirement to unexpected levels. In its most general forum see figure 1 the invention concerns anI.D.R. process for the manufacture of urea, comprising two subsequent loops, wherein A in the first high pressure loop the solution coming from the synthesis zone contains, after the first isobaric strip per of.said I.D.R. process El , a strong NH3 excess NH3 C02 6 by moles and a low C02 percentage C02 urea s 25 b.w. and contains, before the second isobaric stripper E2 of said I.D.R. process, an amount of ammonium carbamate CBE lower than the amount of carbamate CBU contained in the solution leaving the same E2 stripper, wherein the conse quent overproduction of carbamate in E2 releases an amount of heat sufficient to displace a major proportion of the residual NH3 excess contained therein, which allows a reduc tion of the steam wasted in E2 B in the second low pressure loop, the solution leaving E2 is flashed at 20 30 ata and enters a first medium pressure still E3 , heated Indirectly and completely by low pressure recovery steam, coming from the isobaric condensation in E8 of the vapors leaving the top of E2 , said recovery steam having such a thermal level to decompose at least said overproduction of carbamate, originated in E2 C the solution leaving E3 is flashed substantially at 5 ata and enters a second low pressure still E4 and then a vacuum concentrator E5 , wherein the heat of the vapors leaving the head of E3 , rich in NH3 and CO2, is exploited for the working run of E4 and E5 . DETAILS The pressure of the high pressure loop is usually comprised from 120 to 250 kg cm2. The temperature of the solution leaving the first isobaric strip per El is normally from 150 to 2300C. Said NH3 C02 molar ratio of the solution leaving the first iso baric stripper El a6 by moles concerns the total amounts of NH3 and CO2, not only chemically bound e.g. as ammonium carbamate , but also for the amounts bound in the form of urea. Said second isobaric stripper E2 see European patent appli cation 83 105592.6 is a falling film tube bundle heat exchanger, where the solution to be stripped meets a countercurrent stream of CO2, injected from outside, the pipes being heated by condensing steam only in their uppermost portion. Said recovery steam coming from E8 is at a pressure 26.5 abso lute. atmospheres. The usual working pressure of the process side of said vacuum concentrator E5 is approximately 0.35 absolute atmospheres.Because of the high yields of the I.D.R. process, the ratio between the fresh CO2, fed to the second isobaric stripper CO2 inj. , and the carbamate CBE entering the same stripper attains a very high level in general CO2 inj. CBE 2 by moles According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the solution leaving E5 must be further concentrated in E6 as an optional and advantageous way of carrying out the invention exploiting the heat of the recovery steam herein above and the resulting concentrated solution urea 90 95 b.w. is transferred to the final vacuum concentrator E7 the vapors leaving the vacuum concentrators ES, E6 and E7 , containing a certain amount of NH3 and C02, are then condensed in a usual way and a recovery tower C3 allows to obtain a recovery stream to be condensed in Ell , together with the vapors coming from said still E4 . The resulting condensate is recycled to said E4 still shell side the condensed vapors leaving E5 are recompressed by pump PC1 and recycled to the high pressure loop. The first isobaric stripper El of the I.D.R. process can be advantageously a vertical heat exchanger having a tube bundle and being selected from the group comprising the so called falling film and upflow exchangers. The supply of steam at 18 30 ata to said second isobaric stripper E2 may be also lowered to zero, thereby performing a purely adiabatic stripping. The determination of the size of said second E2 stripper is one of the most delicate problems of the whole process the ratio R uppermost surface of the pipes, heated by condensing steam remnant portion of the surface of the pipes should be R 1 and preferably from 1 2 to 1 4 i.e., the uppermost surface of the tubes should be from 1 2 to 1 5 preferably from 1 5 to 1 3 of the total surface. The residence time of the urea solution, in fact, in said uppermost portion of the exchanger must be very short, i.e. equal to or lower than 3 s preferably 2.5 and even better from 1.5 to 2.5 s , the ratio residence time in the lowermost portion residence time in the uppermost portion thus being 1 pref. a2, even better a4 furthermore, the ratio between the exchanging surface ScO of said stripper E2 and the exchanging surface SNH of said stripper El must be preferably greater than one, namely SCO2 SNH3 1 According to a narrower form of the invention, it is advanatageous to carry out a process in which a the urea synthesis is performed at 150 250 C and 170 220 bar b the temperature of the solution entering said second stripper E2 is from 190 to 220 C c the temperature of the solution leaving the bottom of the same stripper E2 is comprised between 150 and 1900C, preferably between 160 and 1900C and advantageously between 160 and 175 C d the temperature of the CO2 carbon dioxide , injected as a stripping agent into the same stripper E2 , is 80 140DC e the solution leaving said first stripper El and entering said second stripper E2 contains such a low amount of CO2 that CO2 urea s 22 b.w. f the NH3 C02 molar ratio, in said solution entering said second stripper E2 , is equal to or higher than 10. The condensation pressure in E5 , and consequently also in E4 , of the heating vapors coming from E3 is very low therefore the pressure of the solution to be distilled in E3 can be lowered to such a level that the heating of the same still E3 can be carried out very advantageously by means of recovery steam at 6.5 9 ata coming from condenser E8 . The lowest temperature of the whole low pressure loop about 900C is registered at the inlet of the first vacuum concentrator E5 , whereafter the temperature gradually increases with the degree of concentration of the final urea solution this is the reason why the condensation temperature on the shell side of said concentration E5 is also very low 115 120 C and this is why, consequently, the pressure of the whole low pressure loop can be kept at a lower level. The basic idea of the new process resides in the transfer of a portion of the thermal load from said second stripper E2 to the first medium pressure still E3 , this latter apparatus, because of the lower working pressure, being very advantageously heated by recovery steam all this is the counterbalance of the fact that the very satisfactory stripping of ammonia in said stripper E6 is bound to the parallel formation of carbamate, the amount of which carbamate, at the outlet of stripper E2 , is greater than at the inlet. The improvement according to the invention is satisfactory, not only when performed within an I.D.R. process, defined in a narrow sense, but also when performed in those double stripping processes in which the second stripper E2 in countercurrent with CO2 is working at a pressure slightly different several tens of atmospheres from the pressure of the first stripper El see e.g. Italian patent publication 24357 A 80. In a narrow sense it is meant that the two strippers El and E2 are isobaric with each other and with the synthesis reactor, apart from the pressure drops bound to hydraulics and similar . As it is known, according to the equation EMI6.1 300 kg of water are by produced per ton of urea and such water is removed, for the most part, within two groups of vacuum concentrators, working at a different degree of vacuum. Until now, the vapors coming from said concentrators, containing 5 76 b.w. NH3 and 2 3 b.w. CO2, were condensed and pumped to a recovery tower C3 in figure 1 , so as to recover the NH3 contained therein in order to lower the amount of residual NH3 in the waste waters at least to 100 200 ppm, while obtaining, from the head of the same tower C3, vapors containing 25 30 b.w. NH3 depending on the working pressure and these vapors were condensed and recycled the steam required by such a recovery unit was approximately 120 kg t of urea. The new low pressure loop of the present invention see figure 2 is an advantageous alternative, with respect to the old kinds of process, in that said steam consumption 120 kg t can be completely suppressed. According to said alternative and to figure 2 , the vapors coming from the vacuum concentrator E6 are condensed within a water cooled apparatus E13 , into which is also conveyed a portion of the vapors 15 coming from the final vacuum concentrator E7 previously compressed in EJ2 , the remnant portion 25 being fed, as a liquid phase, to the recovery tower C3 the basis of such an alternative resides in that said C3 tower contains a vertical falling film tube bundle, heated by the vapors 11 coming from said low pressure still E4 , and in that the vapors 26 , containing NH3 and coming from said C3 tower, are also condensed within said water cooled apparatus E13 , whereafter the liquid condensate 27 leaving said apparatus E13 is recycled to said tower C3 , the bottom of which tower, practically free from NH3 and usually at 70 720C, is partially wasted line 30 and partially line 29 utilized for the scrubbing of the synthesis vent 22 . The vapors rich in recovered NH3 leaving said apparatus E13 see line 31 in figure 3 are treated in a usual way they can be precondensed in E14 , compressed, for instance, by a vacuum pump PV1 e.g. at 1 1.5 kg cm2, absolute and then condensed in E15 , further compressed by pump PC2 , cooled in E16 , together with the scrubbing liquid 35 from tower scrubber C2 . The steam consumption is thus suppressed, while there is a slightly higher power need, approximately 2 Kwh per t of urea . The performance of said apparatus E13 can be surprisingly improved, when using, as shown in figure 3, a vertical exchanger, containing a tube bundle, wherein the cooling medium, e.g. H20 flows within the bundle pipes, said exchanger being characterized in that the vapors to be at least partially condensed enter the lowermost portion of the shell and leave the same shell in its uppermost portion, thus flowing in countercurrent to the liquid condensate, which falls downwards, at least partially along the outer surface of the pipes, and which leaves the lowermost portion of said shell, in a lower position, with respect to the inlet of the vapors. The following examples illustrate the invention without however limiting in any sense the scope thereof.EXAMPLE 1 Operative conditions and composition of the process lines are recorded on Table 1. According to figure 1, the effluent 3 , coming from reactor R1, was transferred to the first falling film stripper El , isobaric with said reactor, in countercurrent to a NH3 stream 2 . It is incidentally noted that this stripper E1 can obviously also work in a purely thermal way, namely without ariy injection of NH3 from outside furthermore, the falling film apparatus can be replaced by an up flow apparatus, like the one indicated in figure 4. The solution leaving E1 flowed into the second falling film isobaric stripper E2 , in countercurrent to a C02 stream 24 . The solution 6 leaving E2 was flashed from 195 to 25 kg cm2 absolute and flowed to the medium pressure falling film still E3 and the solution 8 leaving the bottom of E3 was in turn flashed to 5 kg cm2 absolute and transferred to the low pressure falling film still E4 . The steam condensates coming at about 2250C from El and E2 were used for heating part of the NH3 feed at 2000C , while the remnant portion of NH3 was pre heated at 150 1600C by means of recovery steam. The vapors 9 leaving the head of E3 supplied, while condensing within the shell side, all the heat required by said still E4 and by the first vacuum concentrator E5 , working at about 0.35 kgicm2 absolute , where the solution was concentrated up to about 85 b.w. of urea a further vacuum concentrator E6 , also working at 0.35 kg cm2, and the final vacuum concentrator E7 , working at 0.05 kg cm absolute , brought the concentration up to 99.7X b.w., whereafter the molten urea 13 was ready to flow to a final trilling section P or to other treatment or use, of quite current nature. The vapors 14 and 15 leaving the head of the vacuum concentrators E6 and E7 were condensed within a usual condensation system and were transferred, in the liquid state, to the recovery column C3 , from which a recovery vapor 20 was obtained, that was condensed in Ell , together with the head vapors 11 of the still E4 the resulting condensate 21 entered the shell side of the same E4 still. The condensed vapors 23 leaving E5 were recompressed from 25 to 195 kg cm2 absolute and then conveyed in part, namely about 90 to the high pressure isobaric condenser E8 , by means of ejector EJ1 the remnant about 10 was used as a scrubbing liquid for the vent coming from the reactor tower C1 in figure 1 . The steam balance is recorded on table A as the urea output was 43,863 kg h, the medium pressure steam waste at 25 kg cm2 was 13,158 43,863 x1000 300 kg t of urea and the low pressure steam waste at 8 kg cm2 was only 40,120 36,845 43,863x1000 75 kg t. In other words, the process was nearly self supporting as to the low pressure steam requirement and the medium pressure steam consumption was limited to 300 kg t, which was indeed new and surprising. These results can be moreover improved by further decreasing the low pressure steam consumption in particular, a new recovery system i.e. recovery of NH3 from the reaction waters , allowed to suppress completely the low pressure steam. The basic idea of such a new system was the evaporation of said waters at the same pressure of the first vacuum concentrator E5 , the heat being supplied by a partial condensation of the vapors coming from E4 said new system is described in detail hereinafter in Example 2.EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated, while replacing the recovery operations of figure 1 hatch area by the operations shown in figure 2 data and results were recorded on Table 2 and the steam balance on Table A. According to said figure 2, to said Table 2 and to the preceding figure 1, said vapors 14 coming from E6 were condensed within said apparatus E13 , and said vapors 15 coming from E7 were condensed for the most part first in the water cooled apparatus E17 and then in E13 , after a pressure Increase, by means of ejector EJ2, driven by low pressure steam. A condensated portion 25 of said vapors 15 left the E17 cooler and entered the recovery tower C3 , consisting of a vertical falling film tube bundle, heated by the vapors 11 coming from the still E4 .Also the vapors 26 coming from the C3 tower entered said apparatus E13 , whereafter the liquid condensate 27 leaving same apparatus E13 was recycled to said tower C3 , the bottom of which tower, practically free from NH3 and about at 70 C, was partially wasted line 30 and partially line 29 utilized in C2 , namely in the scrubber of the vent gases 22 . Said waste 30 to disposal practically corresponds to the synthesis water plus the amount of steam used for the driving of ejector EJ2. The vapors 31 , rich in recovered NH3 and leaving the head of E13 , were partially condensed within the E14 cooler the condensate through pump PC7 and the residual vapors through vacuum pump PV1 were transferred to a condensation system E15 working at about 1.5 kg cm2 absolute .The condensate herefrom was transferred, through pump PC2 , to the final condensation system E16 , working at 5 kg cm2 absolute , to which also flowed the condensing mixture 28 coming from tower C3 , the cooling medium being the fresh NH3 of the feed, which was thus pre heated to 70 C. The solution 34 thus obtained joined solution 35 coming from abatement scrubber C2 and the mixture flowed to the shell side of the low pressure still E4 . Such a recovery cycle allowed to remove all the synthesis water, while using recovery steam the steam requirement from outside for the distillation stills E3 and E4 and for the first vacuum concentrator E5 was therefore zero, while the power requirement for the vacuum pump PV1 was merely about 2 Kwh t of urea. With respect to example 1, we registered the output of an excess of low pressure steam at 8 kg cm2, absolute , that can be calculated as follows seeTable A 36,845 34,406 43,863x1000 55 kg t. EXAMPLE 3 Example 2 was repeated, while modifying the first isobaric stripper El , which was an up flow equicurrent apparatus, instead of the former falling film countercurrent exchanger see figure 4 no stripping gas was injected from outside, as a coadjuvant agent. Furthermore, the working of the second isobaric stripper E2 was adiabatic no indirect heat namely no condensing steam was supplied to E2 and the displacement of the NH3 excess was merely bound to the parallel formation of carbamate and to the self cooling of the solution.Moreover, a portion 36 of the vapors leaving the head of said second stripper E2 was recycled directly to the synthesis reactor R1 , because of the thermal balance in a point higher than the inlet of the vapors coming from said first stripper eel . Within said reactor the NH3 C02 molar ratio was 4.5, the H20 C02 molar ratio was 0.4 and the carbamate conversion per pass was 73 . Data and results are on Tables 3 and 4 the NH3 recovery cycle from the synthesis waters is still the cycle of example 2 and the steam balance is recorded on Table A. The reduction of the medium pressure steam consumption to 150 kg t see Table A allows to approximate considerably the exciting threshold of a zero steam requirement, namely the thermal independence. EXAMPLE 4 Example 3 was repeated, apart from the differences hereinafter more heat was supplied to the E3 by means of an increase of the recovery steam coming from E8 , namely more than the heat required by E4 and E5 the consequent excess of heat was recovered by cooling the vapors 9 leaving E3 , rich in NH3 and C02, within a proper exchanger ElO bis , which pre heated the NH3 fresh feed see figure 5 . Such a new exchanger was connected in series with E4 and E5 and was fed not only by vapors 9 described herein above but also by a liquid phase 21 in order to speed up the condensation of the same vapors 9 see figure 5 . The steam balance was recorded on Table A.Should the exchanger ElO bis be connected in parallel, results would be nearly the same.
