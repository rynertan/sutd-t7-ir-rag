# Method for production of composite material using preheating of reinforcing material.

## Abstract
A method of producing a composite material from porous reinforcing material and molten matrix metal. First the porous reinforcing material is heated to a temperature substantially above the melting point of the matrix metal. Then the molten matrix metal is infiltrated into the porous structure of the reinforcing material under a substantial pressure. Then the combination of the reinforcing material and the matrix metal infiltrated thereinto is cooled down to a temperature below the melting point of the matrix metal, while maintaining the above mentioned substantial press ure. Optionally, the reinforcing material may be charged into a case and, again optionally, the case may have one opening only, and a vacant space may be left between another part of the case and the reinforcing material charged in the case, with the reinforcing material interrupting com munication between the opening and the vacant space. The case can be made of stainless steel, or of a refractory material such as porous brick. Alternatively, the reinforcing material may be restrained by ties or tapes clamped on it. Possible materials for the reinforcing material include fibres of alumina, carbon, boron, or stainless steel, and possible materials for the matrix metal include aluminium and magnesium.
