# Granular fertilizer composition having controlled release and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Fertilizer composition in granular form having a regulated release of water soluble fertilizer agents such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium compounds. Each granule has a core comprising fertilizer substances having a known pH value, and a coating encapsulating the cord. The coating is based on dicyclopentadiene and either linseed oil or a soy bean oil alkyd. The coating serves as a pH regulator, so that for a core having a pH value below 6.0, the pH of the coating is regulated to be in the range of 6.0 to 9.0, while for a core having a pH value higher than 6.0 the coating includes a mixture of trace element compounds and has a pH value lying between 4.5 and 9.0.
