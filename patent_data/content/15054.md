# Bus connection systems.

## Abstract
A bus connection system in which a central processing unit 14 is connected to each of a plurality of buses 20, 21 via respective drivers 15, 17 and receivers 16, 18 . Peripheral circuits 22 to 25 are connected each to one only of the buses 20, 21 . Data can be passed between the central processing unit 14 and a peripheral circuit 22 to 25 via the appropriate bus by control of the drivers and receivers 15 to 18 by control signals c, d, e, f from the central processing unit 14 . The central processing unit 14 and the peripheral cir cuits are mounted on respective printed circuit boards 19, 22 to 25 and a back panel 26 carrying all of the buses 20, 21 connects the printed circuit boards.
