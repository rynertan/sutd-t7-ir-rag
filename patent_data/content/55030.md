# Electrographic method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described wherein an infor mation bearing charge pattern is applied to an insulating imag ing member by styli in contact with the insulating imaging member, the force of the styli on the imaging member being below the triboelectric threshold. Preferably, the force of the styli on the imaging member is also the imaging treshold, whereby voltage signals applied to the styli produce on the imaging member a latent image of information to be recorded.
