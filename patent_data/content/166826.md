# Gas pressure regulator.

## Abstract
The regulator employs a cartridge through which gas flows from right to left to a low pressure chamber past a poppet 43 when the poppet is lifted off a seat 45 . On the high pressure side the poppet has a shaft 49 sliding in a bush 54 and surrounded by a seating spring 53 . On the low pressure side a smaller diameter centering shaft 47 protrudes through the seat to bear against a conventional diaphragm which is acted upon differentially by the low pressure and an adjustable regulating spring. In order to eliminate destructive and noisy vibrations, the centering shaft 47 slides through a protruding portion 59 on the low pressure side of the seat 45 . The protruding portion is provided with 3 to 6 preferably 4 equally spaced slots for gas flow.
