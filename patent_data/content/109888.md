# Subsurface Zener diode.

## Abstract
A novel zener diode is formed which is suitable for use either as a discrete zener diode, or as one element of an integrated circuit device. In one embodiment, a zener diode is fabricated utilizing an additional introduction of dopants in the zener diode, while forming other devices without this additional dopant introduction. Thus, the zener diode is formed having a large channel width, and therefore low series resistance and high parasitic JFET pinchoff voltage, while the remaining devices are formed having the desired current gains. In another embodiment, the zener diode is fabricated wherein the PN junction of the zener diode located at portions near the surface of the device are specifically fabricated to have higher zener breakdown voltages than the zener breakdown voltage of the zener diode PN junction located beneath the surface of the zener diode, thereby providing improved zener diode characteristics as compared with certain zener diodes of the prior art where the zener breakdown occurs at the surface of the device.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to semiconductor devices and more particularly for zener diodes for use either as discrete devices or in integrated circuits. Descrintnon of the Prior Art Zener diodes are well known in the prior art and serve to provide a stable reference voltage and thus zener diodes must exhibit both short term i.e. on the order of minutes and long term i.e. on the order of many hours zener voltage stability, low zener noise fluctuations in zener breakdown voltage from a nominal value , minimum series resistance and a highly reproducible zener breakdown voltage among a plurality of devices. When zener diodes are formed as one component within an integrated circuit, the zener diode must be fabricated in a manner which allows the zener breakdown voltage to be varied during fabrication without affecting other devices within the same integrated circuit, and which allows the zener diode to be fabricated with the same process as is used to form the other devices within the integrated circuit. One such prior art zener diode is shown in the crosssectional view of Figure 1, and is described, for example, in an article by Kennedy and O Brien entitled AvalancheBreakdown Characteristics of a Diffused P N Junction , IRETransactions on Electron Devices, November 1962, pages 478 483, which is hereby incorporated by reference. As shown in Figure 1, a transistor comprising N type collector region 11, P type base region 12, and N emitter region 13 is formed in a semiconductor substrate. Of importance, when this transistor is utilized as a zener diode, the collector 11 is not connected to a voltage potential, and the PN zener diode is formed by P type base 12 and N emitter 13. Such so called emitter base zener diodes are easily fabricated utilizing well known processes for fabricating bipolar transistors.Such emitter base zener diodes are highly reproducible, thereby providing a substantially equal zener breakdown voltage in a plurality of devices, due to the high degree of control of dopant concentration in P type base region 12 which, in integrated circuits, is required to provide the desired sheet resistance for base regions of the bipolar transistors which are formed simultaneously with the formation of the emitterbase zener diode. Rowever, the zener breakdown voltage of such emitter base diodes is unstable, with drift in the zener breakdown voltage often greater than approximately 30 millivolts in the first few minutes of operation of the device.Furthermore, the zener noise of such emitter base zener diodes is very high and not predictable, and the long term zener breakdown voltage stability is poor because the zener breakdown occurs in part at that point of the emitter 13 base 12 junction which is on the surface of the device i.e., adjacent to oxide layer 14 , where a rather high concentration of so called surface states are present. Such surface states are described in the text byA.S. Grove entitled Physics and Technology of SemiconductorDevices , John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1967, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Another prior art zener diode is a so called isolation emitter subsurface zener diode shown in the cross sectional view in Figure 2 and described in an article by Dobkin entitled Monolithic Temperature Stabilized Voltage Reference with 0.5 pom 0 Drift , 1976 IEEE International SolidState Circuits Conference, February 19, 1976, pages 108 109, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The isolation emitter zener diode of Figure 2 includes P type isolation region 23 formed in N epitaxial layer 22. Contact to the P isolation region 23 is made by means of P type base region 24. N emitter 25 is formed as shown, and the subsurface zener diode is formed at the junction of P isolation region 23 and N emitter region 25.Of importance, the entire junction between P isolation region 23 and NC emitter region 25 is located beneath the surface 28 of the integrated circuit, thus providing substantially increased zener breakdown voltage stability as compared with the emitter base zener diode of Figure 1. However,P isolation region 23 is typically rather large, thus providing a very large zener junction between PC isolation region 23 and Ne emitter region 25, thus providing a very high zener diode noise level. Furthermore, in order to provide a highly controllable zener breakdown voltage, the dopant concentration of the P isolation region 23 must be tightly controlled.This is a distinct disadvantage when fabricating integrated circuits, because the dopant concentration of the P isolation region 23 is not generally tightly controlled because it is not necessary to do so when the P isolation region 23 is used solely for isolation and not for forming part of a zener diode. However, even with tight control of the isolation region 23 dopant concentration, the zener breakdown voltage between devices may vary by as much as one half v olt. Furthermore, the P type base region 24 which provides electrical connection to PC isolation region 23 forms a parasitic P channel junction field effect transistor JFET as shown in Figures 3 and 4. As shown in the more detailed cross sectional view of Figure 3 and the corresponding schematic diagram of Figure d, PC isolation region 23 forms the drain of JFET 30, NC region 25 forms the gate of JFET 30, the portion of P region 24 located beneath N region 25 forms the channel of JFET 30, and the portion of P type region 2t which is electrically connected to other devices forms the source of JFET 30.As previously described, P isolation region 23 forms the anode of subsurface zener diode 31 and NC emitter region 25 forms the cathode of subsurface zener diode 31. In a similar manner P region 24 forms the anode of the so called surface zener diode 32, and NC region 25 forms the cathode of the surface zener diode 32. Accordingly, the channel resistance of the JFET 30 is always connected in series with subsurface zener diode 31, thus providing an undesirably high series resistance. More importantly, however, is that if the pinchoff voltage of JFET 30 i.e., that drain voltage above which JFET 30 turns off is less than the zener breakdown voltage of the subsurface zener diode 31,JFET 30 will remain off and zener diode 31 will never receive the voltage to be clamped from terminals 35.In this case, only surface zener diode 32 will clamp the voltage on terminals 35. This clamping by surface zener diode is undesirable because surface zener diode 32 is susceptible to all of the disadvantages of the emitter base zener diode previously described. The pinchoff voltage of JFET 30 is defined as VP KW2chPch 1 where Vp is the pinchoff voltage K is a constant Wch is the channel width as shown in Figures 2 and 3 and Pch is the impurity concentration of the channel region 24.In order to provide that the pinchoff voltage of JFET 30 is greater than the zener breakdown voltage of subsurface zener diode 31, the channel width Wch and or the iopant concentration ch of the channel 24 must be rather high. Because, in an integrated circuit, transistordevices not shown are formed simultaneously with the formation of the zener diode of Figure 2, with the base regions of the transistor devices being formed simultaneously with region 24 of Figure 2, a rather large channel width Wch and dopant concentration Pch of region 24 will provide a rather large base width and base region dopant concentration, thus providing an undesirable low current gain, or beta , for transistors formed in the remainder of the integrated circuit. Yet another prior art zener diode is described byKwan in a research paper entitled Ion Implanted Sub SurfaceMonolithic Zener Diode submitted to the Department ofElectrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 1978 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The Kwan structure is shown in the crosssectional view of Figure 5. The structure of Figure 5 provides a zener diode having extremely low zener noise due to the very low zener junction area, and highly reproducible and stable zener breakdown voltage. However, the Kwan structure of Figure 5 requires two diffusion steps, two masking steps, and two dopant implants in addition to the standard processing steps used to fabricate bipolar devices.Using this approach, the structure of Figure 5 is fabricated substantially independently from the process steps required to fabricate the bipolar devices not shown which are formed simultaneously in the remainder of the integrated circuit, thus resulting in a rather complex and expensive fabrication process. Furthermore, the structure of Figure 5 utilizes an ion implantation to form the interconnection region 81 between the zener junction 93 and the P type electrical contact 94, thus providing an undesirable high resistance in series with the zener diode, thus degrading the ability of the zener diode to clamp the voltage applied to the zener diode to a selected value over a wide range of current. SUERRY In accordance with the teachings of this invention, a novel zener diode is formed which is suitable for use either as a discrete zener diode, or as one element of an integrated circuit device. In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, a zener diode is fabricated utilizing an additional introduction of dopants in the zener diode, while forming other devices without this additional dopant introduction.Thus, the zener diode is formed having a large channel width, and therefore low series resistance and high parasitic JFET pinchoff voltage, while the remaining devices are formed having the desired current gains. In accordance with another embodiment of this invention, the zener diode is fabricated wherein the PN junction of the zener diode located at portions near the surface of the device are specifically fabricated tc have higher zener breakdown voltages than the zener breakdown voltage of the zener diode PN junction located beneath the surface of the zener diode, thereby providing improved zener diode characteristics as compared with certain zener diodes of the prior art where the zener breakdown occurs at the surface of the device.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a prior art zener diode Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of another prior art zener diode Figure 3 is a more detailed view of the prior art zener diode Figure 2 Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of the structure ofFigure 3 Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of yet another prior zener diode Figure 6a is a cross sectional view of a zener diode constructed in accordance with one embodiment of this invention Figures 6b 6g depict one fabrication process used to construct the zener diode of Figure 6a Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of a zener diode constructed in accordance with another embodiment of this invention Figure 8 is a more detailed cross sectional view of a portion of a zener diode of Figure 7 Figures 9a through 9g depict one fabrication process used to form one embodiment of the zener diode of this invention simultaneously with the formation of other semiconductor devices.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The cross sectional view of Figure 6a shows one embodiment of a zener diode constructed in accordance with this invention. The presence of P type region 29, by increasing the channel width Wch to approximately 8 microns, as compared to the channel widths of prior art devices typically 1 to 2 microns raises the pinchoff voltage of the parasitic JFET previously described in reference toFigure 4 to a value much in excess of the zener breakdown voltage, significantly reduces the effect of the parasiticJFET formed by regions 23, 24 and 25, while leaving unchanged the zener diode characteristics. One technique for manufacturing the subsurface zener diode of Figure 6a and simultaneously fabricating bipolar transistors will be described in conjunction with figures 6b through 6g. As shown in Figure 6b, a P type silicon substrate 11 having a conductivity within the range of approximately 5 to 20 ohm cm in a crystal orientation 111 is utilized. Oxide layer 12 is formed on the surface of substrate 11 to a thickness of approximately 1.3 microns, for example, by oxidation in wet oxygen at approximately 11000C for approximately 60 minutes.Oxide layer 12 is then patterned, for example utilizing well known photolith graphic and etching techniques, to define openings for the formation of N buried collector regions 13a and 13b.These openings within oxide layer 12 are formed, for example, by etching with buffered hydrofluor ic acid. The NC buried collector regions 13a, 13b are then formed, for example by first depositing either arsenic or antimony dopant to provide a sheet resistance of approximately 25 ohms square, such as from an antimony trioxide Sb203 source at approximately 12700C for approximately 60 minutes.When antimony dopant is used, it is then diffused into substrate 11, for example, during the formation of oxide layer 14. The formation of oxide layer 14 and the diffusion of the antimony dopant are performed, for example, by subjecting substrate 11 to dry oxygen at approximately 12700C for approximately 360 minutes, thus forming oxide 14 to a thickness of approximately 4000 angstroms. The thickness of oxide 12 is increased somewhat during this step, although this is unimportant. Buried collector region 13a will serve as the anode of the to be formed zener diode la, and buried collector region 13b will serve as the collector of the to be formed NPN transistor Ib. Oxide layers 12 and 14 are then removed, for example, by etching with hydroflouric acid. A layer of N type epitaxial silicon 15 is then formed on P substrate 11, as shown in Figure 6c. This layer of epitaxial silicon 15 is formed to a thickness of approximately 18 microns, for example by using SiC1, at approximately 11500C for a sufficient time to provide the desired thickness of epi taxial silicon 15. Epitaxial silicon 1S has a dopant concentration within the range of approximately I x 1014 to 5 x 1015 atoms 3 and a conductivity within the range of approximately 1 to 5 ohm cm.The combination of substrate ll and epitaxial silicon layer 15 will hereinafter be referred to as a wafer. Referring to Figure 6c, a layer of oxide 16 is then formed on the surface of epitaxial silicon 15. Oxide 16 is formed to a thickness of approximately 13,000 angstroms, for example, by oxidation in wet oxygen at approximately 11000C for approximately 120 minutes. Oxide layer 16 is then patterned, for example utilizing well known photolithographic and etching techniques to define the locations ofP isolation regions 17. Exposed portions of oxide layer 16 are etched, for example, with buffered hydrofluoric acid, thereby exposing the regions within epitaxial silicon layer 15 in which P isolation regions 17 are to be formed.As shown in Figure 6c, P isolation regions 17 are then formed, for example by introducing boron dopant into the exposed regions of epitaxial silicon 15 to provide a sheet resistance of approximately 6 ohms square, for example, by utilizing a B203 source at approximately 11000C for approximately 30 minutes. After this boron deposition into regions 191 the wafer is again masked to open an additional region 22 around that portion of region 17 which is to form the zener diode.The wafer is again introduced to a second boron deposition of higher sheet resistance, for example, using a BN source at approximately 9650C for approximately 20 minutes to give a sheet resistance of approximately 50 ohms square. The boron dopant which has been deposited through the openings of oxide 16 into the to be formed P isolation regions 17 and into the to be formed region 22 is then diffused, for example during the formation of oxide layer 18. Oxide layer 18 is formed and the boron dopant is diffused, for example, by subjecting the wafer to dry oxygen at approximately 12000C for approximately 4 hours, thus forming oxide layer 18 to a thickness of approximately 6000 anstroms, and diffusing the P dopants to form PC isolation regions 17 and region 22 as shown in Figure 6c.During tne formation of oxide 18, the thickness of oxide layer 16 is increased slightly, although this is unimportant. As shown in Figure 6d, N contact 19b is formed to provide electrical connection to NC buried collector region 13b. To form NC contact region l9b, oxide layer 16 is patterned, for example utilizing well known photolith ographic techniques, in order to define the locations of N contact region 19b. The exposed portions of oxide layer 16 are then etched, for example with buffered hydro fluoric acid, thereby exposing the surface of epitaxial silicon layer 15 in the location of the to be formed N contact region 19b.N type dopants are then deposited in the exposed regions of epitaxial layer 15. This deposition is performed, for example, by the introduction of phosphorus dopant to provide a V I characteristic of approximately 2.2 such as by using a POCl3 source at approximately 11000C for approximately 1 hour. The N type dopant is then diffused, for example, by subjecting the wafer to dry oxygen at approximately 12000C for approximately ISO minutes, thereby diffusing the NC dopant to form N contact 19b which makes contact with NC buried collector region 13b. During this diffusion, oxide layer 20 is formed to a thickness of approximately 3000 angstroms.During this formation of oxide layer 20, oxide layers 16 and 18 are also increased slightly in thickness, although this is unimportant. Of importance, N contact region 19b needs only be formed if it is desired to reduce the saturation resistance of the transistors or other diodes formed simultaneously with the zener diode formed in accordance with this invention. As shown in Figure 6e, oxide layers 16 and 18 are then patterned to form openings 21a and 21b for the formation of P type zener diode region 23a which overlaps region 22 previously former, and P type transistor base 23b, respectively. In this step, oxide layers 16 and 18 are patterned, for examcle, by using well known photolithographic techniques, and the exposed portions of oxide layer 16 are removed, for example by etching with buffered hydrofluoric acid.P type dopants are then introduced into the exposed portions of epitaxial silicon layer 15, for example by exposing the surface of the wafer to a BN source at approximately 900 10000C for approximately 35 minutes, thereby introducing dopants into the exposed portions of epitaxial layer 15 to provide a sheet resistance within the range of approximately 40 to 60 ohms souare. These P type dopants are then diffused, for example by exposing the wafer to wet oxygen at approx imately 11500C for approximately 90 minutes, thereby forming an oxide layer 56 Figure 6f over the P type regions 23a, and 23b to a thickness of approximately 5000 angstroms.The thickness of oxide regions 16, 18, and 20 are increased slightly during this step, although this slight increase in thickness is unimportant. Referring now to Figure 6f, the locations of N regions 25a, 25b, 25c and 25d are now defined, for example by utilizing well known photolithographic techniques. The exposed portions of oxide layer 56 are then removed, for example by etching with buffered hydrofluornc acid, thereby exposing those portions of epitaxial silicon layer 15 where N regions 25a through 25d are to be formed. NC regions 25a through 25d are then formed, for example by depositing phosphorus dopant to provide a V I characteristic within the range of approximately 4 to 6 ohms square into the exposed portions of epitaxial silicon layer 15 for example, by using a POCl3 source at approximately 10200C. These phosphorus dopants are then diffused to form NC regions 25a through 25d, for example, by subjecting the wafer to wet oxygen at approximately 10700C for approx imately 30 minutes, thereby forming oxide layers 57 to a thickness of approximately 2200 anstroms. The thicknesses of oxide layer 16, 18, 20, and 56 are also increased slightly during this time, although this slight increase in thickness is unimportant. Region 25a serves as the cathode of the zener diode la and must overlap the diffused edge of region 17. Region 25b serves as the emitter ofNPN transistor lb. Region 25c serves as a contact to collector region 13a and region 25d serves as a contact to collector region 13p. As shown in Figure 6g, electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30 4 are then formed, if desired. These electrical interconnects are formed by first patterning the oxide layers 16, 18, 20, 56 and 57 to expose those regions formed within epitaxial silicon layer 15 which are to be connected to electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30 4.This definition of oxide layers 16, 18, 20, 56 and 57 is performed, for example, by well known photolithographic techniques and etching the exposed portions of the oxide layers with buffered hydro fluoric acid. with the selected regions formed within epitaxial silicon layer 15 exposed by the removal of appropriate portions of the oxide layer, a layer of electrically conductive material, such as aluminum, an alloy of aluminum, or doped polycrystalline silicon, is then formed on the surface of the wafer in a well known manner and patterned utilizing well known photo lithographic etching techniques in order to form the plurality of electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30 4. The completed structure is thus shown in figure 6g. A cross sectional view of another embodiment of this invention is shown in Figure 7. Formed on silicon substrate 11 is N type epitaxial silicon layer 50. Within N type epitaxial region 50 is formed P type region 51 which forms the anode of the zener diode constructed in accordance with this embodiment of my invention. Formed withinP type region 51 is N region 52, which forms the cathode of the zener diode. N type region 54 is formed as shown within P type region 51. The surface of the substrate is covered with an insulation layer 53 through which openings are formed and electrical contacts 55 and 56 are formed to provide electrical interconnection to P type region 51 and N region 52, respectively.An expanded view of a portion of the structure of Figure 7 is shown in the cross sectional view of Figure 8, with corresponding regions labeled with corresponding numbers. The zener breakdown voltage of region A of the struc ture of Figure 8 is the plane Junction breakdown voltage of the junction between N type region 54 and P type region 51. For the PN junction of region A, which may be con sidered to be a symmetrical step junction since the dopant concentrations are substantially equal although of opposite conductlvity types on each side of the junction, the avalanche electrical field i.e., the electric field required to cause avalanche across a PN junction is about 2.5 x 105 volts cm.The zener breikdowe voltage of region A is defined by the following equation V Ea2 Esi qN 9.77 volts where N the concentration of donor atoms or acceptor atoms 4 x 1018 atoms cm3 ESi the dielectric constant of silicon lo 12 farads cm E a the critical electric field at breakdown q the magnitude of the charge of an electron 1.6 x 10 19 coulomb and V the zener breakdown voltage of region A. The zener breakdown voltage of the PN junction of region B of Figure 8 is dependent on the radius of curvature of the PN junction of region B. In order for the radius of curvature of the PN junction to have a significant effect on the zener breakdown voltage, the radius of curvature of the junction must be less than the width of the depletion layer during avalanche. The depletion width Wd is defined as Wd f NAt NDi Ea where N A The concentration of acceptor atoms and N The concentration of donor atoms. Accordingly, it has been found that if the PN junction of region B is located in excess of approximately 0.2 microns from the surface 99 of the device, the radius of curvature of the PN junction of region B will not significantly reduce the zener breakdown voltage of the PN junction of region B below the zener breakdown voltage of the PN junction of region A. This is desirable in order to eliminate the effects of the surface zener diode formed in region B. The zener breakdown voltage of the PN junction of region C is merely the subsurface zener breakdown voltage of the emitter base junction of conventional PN diodes.For the PN junction of region C, the zener breakdown voltage is typically on the order of approximately 6 volts. The zener breakdown voltage of the PN junction of region B is substantiahly higher than that of regions C and D since the dopant concentration of region 54 is much less than the dopant concentration of region 52. Region D will have a higher zener breakdown voltage than region C because the dopant concentration of region 51 within region D is lower than the dopant concentration of region 51 within region C due to the resultant dopant redistribution effects caused by the curvature of the PN junction within region D. The portion of region C nearest region D thus has the highest dopant concentration of both regions 51 and 52, and thus the portion of region C nearest region D has the lowest zener breakdown voltage of regions A, B, C and D. The PN junctions of regions A, B, C and D act together in order that the zener breakdown voltage of the device as a whole will be dominated by that portion of region C nearest region D, because all other regions have higher breakdown voltages than this portion of region C. Accordingly, the dopant requirements necessary to fabricate a zener diode in accordance with this embodiment of my invention are as follows. First, the dopant concentration of N type region 54 must be at least slightly greater than the dopant concentration of P type region 51 at surface 99, in order to provide within region 54 a greater concentration of N type impurities than P type impurities, thereby causing region 54 to be a lightly doped N type region.Secondly, the dopant concentration of N type region 54 must be lower at least by a factor of ten and preferably by a factor of one hundred than the dopant concentration of N region 52 at surface 99 in order to provide an N type dopant concentration of region 54 within region A which is substantially equal to the P type dopant concentration of region 54 within regions A and B, thus causing regions A and B to act as symmetrical junctions having higher zener breakdown voltages than zener breakdown voltage of regions C and D. The thicknessT1 of N type region 54 is preferably much less than the thickness T2 of P type region 51 in order to minimize the series resistance of P type region 51. Preferably, the thickness of region 54 at most is ten percent of the thickness of region 51.Finally, the thickness T1 of N type region 54 must be much greater preferably by at least a factor of ten than the width of the depletion region not shown during zener breakdown. The depletion region width during zener breakdown is approximately 0.0 with the depletion region width being greater on a curved junction e.g. within regions B and D due to electric field crowding than along the substantially straight junction of region A. With the thickness of region 54 greater than the width of the depletion region during zener breakdown, the curvature of the PN junction within region B has little effect on the zener breakdown voltage of region B, thereby maintaining the zener breakdown voltage of region B greater than the zener breakdown voltage of region D, thus preventing zener breakdown from occurring within region B. It is also desirable, although not necessary, that the dopant concentration gradient between N type region 54 and P region 51 be less by at least a factor of 10 and preferably by a factor of 100 than the dopant concentration gradient between P type region 51 and N region 52, in order to insure that the zener breakdown voltages of regions A and B are greater than the zener breakdown voltage of region D. The zener noise of a zener diode constructed in accordance with this embodiment of my invention is similar to the zener noise of the Kwan structure previously described due to the small area in which zener breakdown occurs i.2., the small portion of region C nearest region D . In addition, the contribution to the zener noise due to series resistance is lower than in the Kwan structure due to the lower resistance of region 51 Figure 8 as compared with Kwan s region 81 Figure 5 . One technique for manufacturing the subsurface zener diode constructed in accordance with this invention and simultaneously fabricating bipolar transistors will be described in conjunction with figures 9a through 9g. As shown in Figure 9a, a P type silicon substrate 11 having a conductivity within the range of approximately 5 to 20 ohm cm and a crystal orientation 111 is utilized. Oxide layer 12 is formed on the surface of substrate 11 to a thickness of approximately 1.3 microns, for example, by oxidation in wet oxygen at approximately 11000C for approximately 60 minutes. Oxide layer 12 is then patterned, for example utilizing well known photolithographic and etching techniques, to define openings for the formation of N buried collector regions 13a and 13b.These openings within oxide layer 12 are formed, for example, by etching with buffered hydrofluoric acid. The NC buried collector regions 13a, 13b are then formed, for example, by first depositing either arsenic or antimony dopant to provide a sheet resistance of approximately 25 ohms square, such as from an antimony trioxide Sb203 source at approximately 12700C for approximately 60 minutes. When antimony dopant is used, it is then diffused into substrate 11, for example, during the formation of oxide layer 14.Oxide layer 14 and the diffusion of the antimony dopant is performed, for example, by subjecting substrate 11 to dry oxygen at approximately 12703C for approximately 36t minutes, thus forming oxide 14 to a thickness of approximately 4000 angstrcms. The thickness of oxide 12 is increased somewhat during this step, although this is unimportant. Buried collector region 13a will serve as the anode of the to be formed zener diode la, and buried collector region 13b will serve as the collector of the to be formed NPN transistor Ib. Oxide layers 12 and 14 are then removed, for example, by etching with hydrofluoric acid. A layer of N type epitaxial silicon 15 is then formed on substrate 11, as shown in Figure 9b. This layer of epitaxial silicon 15 is formed to a thickness of approximately 18 microns, for example by using SiCla at approximately 11500C for a sufficient time to provide the desired thickness of epitaxial silicon 15. Epitaxial silicon 15 has a dopant concentration within the range of approximately 1 x 1014 to 5 x 1015 atoms cm3 and a conductivity within the range of approximately 1 to 5 ohm cm. The combination of sub strata 11 and epitaxial silicon layer 15 will hereinafter be referred to as a wafer.1 A layer of oxide 16 is then formed on the surface of epitaxial silicon 15.Oxide 16 is formed to a thickness of approximately 13,000 angstroms, for example, by oxidation in wet oxygen at approximately 11000C for approximately 120 minutes. Oxide layer 16 is then patterned, for example utilizing well known photo lithographic and etching techniques to define the locations of P isolation regions 17. Portions of oxide layer 15 are etched, for example, with buffered hydrofluoric acid to expose the regions within epitaxial silicon layer 15 in which P isolation regions 17 are to be formed. P isolation regions 17 are then formed, for example by introducing boron dopant into the exposed regions of epitaxial silicon 15 to provide a sheet resistance of approximately 6 ohms square, for example, by utilizing a B203 source at approximately 1100oC for approx imately 30 minutes. The boron dopant which is deposited through the openings of oxide 16 into the to be formed PC isolation regions 17 is then diffused, for example during the formation of oxide layer 18.Oxide layer 18 is formed and the P isolation dopant is d ffused, for example, by subjecting the wafer to dry oxygen at approximately 12000 for approximately 4 hours, thus forming oxide layer 18 to a thickness of approximately 6000 anstroms, and diffusing the P dopants to form P isolation regions 17 as shown inFigure 9b. During the formation of oxide 18, the thickness of oxide layer 16 is increased slightly, although this is unimportant. As showy in Figure 9c, N contact l9b is formed to provide electrical connection to NC buried collector region 13b. To form N contact region l9b, oxide layer 16 is patterned, for example, utilizing well known photolith graphic techniques, in order to define the locations ofN contact region 1sub. The exposed portion of oxide layer 16 is then removed, for example, by etching with buffered hydrofluoric acid, thereby exposing the surface of epitaxial silicon layer 15 in the location of the to be formed N contact region l9b. N type dopants are then deposited in the exposed regions of epitaxial layer 15.This deposition is performed, for example, by the introduction of phosphorus dopant to provide a V I caracteristic of approximately 2.2 such as by using a POCK3 source at approximately 11000C for approximately I hour. The N type dopant is then diffused, for example, by subjecting the wafer to dry oxygen at approximately l2000C for approximately 180 minutes, thereby dl using the NT dopant to form NC contact 19b which makes contact with NC buried collector region 13b. During this diffusion, oxide layer 20 is formed to a thickness of approximately 3000 angstroms.During this formation of oxide layer 20, oxide layers 16 and 18 are also increased slightly in thickness, although this is unimportant Of importance, NC contact region I9b need only be formed if it is desired to reduce the saturation resistance of the transistors or other diodes formed simultaneously with the zener diode formed in accordance with this invention. As shown in Figure 9d, the location 21a where the zener diode is to be formed is then defined, for example, by well known photolithographic techniques. The exposed portion of oxide layer 16 which indicates where the zener diode is to be formed is removed, for example, by etching with buffered hydrofluoric acid An N type region 22 is then formed, for example, by the ion implantation of arsenic into reexposed portion of epitaxial layer 15.This arsenic implant is performed, for example, by well known ion implantation techniques utilizing an energy level of approximately 150 REV to a dosage within the range of approximately 2x101 to l0x1014 atoms cm2. This dosage is adjusted to optimize the zener diode characteristics in accordance with the dopant concentration of the to be formed P type region 23a Fig. 9e . During this ion implantation, oxide layers 16, 18, and 20 serve as a mask, thereby preventing the implantation of arsenic into regions other than region 22 where the oxide layer 16 has been removed. As shown in Figure 9e, oxide layer 16 is then patterned to form openings 21z and 21b for the formation of P type zener diode region 23a and P type transistor base 23b, respectively. In this step, oxide layer 16 is pattermed, for example, by using well known photolithographic techniaues, and the exposed portions of oxide layer 16 are removed, for example by etching with buffered hydro fluoric acid.P type dopants are then deposited in the exposed portions of epitaxial layer iS, for example by exposing the surface of the wafer to a BN source at approximately 900 1000 C for approximately 35 minutes, thereby introducing dopants into the exposed portions of epitaxial layer 15 to provide a sheet resistance within the range of approxImately 40 to 60 ohms square. These P type dopants are then diffused, for example by exposing the wafer to wet oxygen at approximately IlSOaC for approximately 90 minutes, thereby forming an oxide layer 56 Figure 9Î over the P type regions 23a and 23b to a thickness of approximately 5000 angstroms.The thickness of oxide regions 16, 18, and 20 are increased slightly during this step, although this slight increase in thickness is unimportant. If it is desired to modify the zener breakdown voltage from the value which will be provided by the dopants and concentration given by the above described process steps, without affecting the operation of other transistors and diodes being formed simultaneously with the formation of the zener diodes, a masking step to expose only that portion of epitaxial silicon layer 15 where region 24a is to be formed i.e., and not region 23b is utilized, and an additional dopant implantation used which, after diffusion, provides region 24a Figures 9e 9g . If such additional implant is made with a P type dopant such as boron , the zener voltage will be reduced while if it is made with anN type dopant such as phosphorus , the zener voltage will be increased.Such adjustment of the zener breakdown voltage is capable of providing an adjustment of approximately 30 of the nominal zener voltage of zener diodes. Referring now to Figure 9f, the locations of NC regions 25a through 25d are now defined, for example by utilizing well known photolithographic technicues. The exposed portions of oxide layers 56, 16 and 20 then removed, for example by etching with buffered hydrofluoric acid, thereby exposing those portions of epitaxial silicon layer 15 where N regions 25a through 25d are to be formed. NC regions 25a through 25d are then formed, for example by depositing phosphorus dopant to provide a V I characteristic within the range of approximately 4 to 6 ohms square into the exposed portions of epitaxial silicon layer 15, for example, by using a rOC13 source at approximately l0200C. These phosphorus dopants are then diffused to form N regions 25a through 25d for example, by subjecting the wafer to wet oxygen at approximately 10704C for approxi mately 30 minutes, thereby forming oxide layer 57 to a thickness of approximately 2200 anstroms. The thicknesses of oxide layer 16, 18, 20, and 56 are also increased slightly during this time, although this slight increase in thickness is unimportant. Region 25a serves as the cathode of the zener diode la, and region 25b serves as the emitter of NPN transistor lb. Region 25c serves as a collector contact to collector region 13a and region 25d serves as a collector contact to collector region 13b. As shown in Figure 9g, electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30 are then formed, if desired. These electrical interconnects are formed by first patterning the oxide layers 16, 18, 56 and 57 to expose those regions formed within epitaxial silicon layer 15 which are to be connected to electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30To. This definition of oxide layers 16, 18, 56 and 57 is performed, for example, by well known photolithographic techniques and etching the oxide layers with buffered hydrofluoric acid. With the selected regions formed within epitaxial silicon layer 15 exposed by the removal of appropriate portions of the oxide layer, a layer of electrically conductive material, such as aluminum, an alloy of aluminum, or doped polycrystalline silicon, is then formed on the surface of the wafer and patterned utilizing well known photolithographic etching techniques in order to form the plurality of electrical interconnects 30 1 through 30 4.

Numerous other embodiments of my invention will become readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of the specification.
