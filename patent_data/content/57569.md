# Apparatus for measuring neutrons and gamma rays.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring neutrons and gamma rays is disclosed in which after pulses generated by neutrons are dis criminated from pulses generated by gamma rays, two diffe rent counted values are obtained 24, 26 for either the pulses generated by neutrons or the pulses generated by gamma rays to control a discriminating circuit between the pulses by neu trons and the pulses by gamma rays so that a ratio between the different counted values is kept constant, and further two different counted values are obtained for either the pulses by neutrons or the pulses by gamma rays in a manner 24, 30 same as the above mentioned to control the output of a detec tor 10, 12 so that a ratio between the counted values is kept constant.
