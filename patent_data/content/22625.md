# Short path liquid junction structure for electrochemical electrodes.

## Abstract
A short path liquid junction structure 16 is defined through a porous ceramic layer 28 coated circumferentially on an electrochemical electrode glass body 12 by an elastomeric O ring sealing member 30 circumferentially engaging the ceramic layer 28 in an annular line contact seal. The length of the liquid junction path is the short distance through the porous ceramic layer 28 around and past the line contact seal.
