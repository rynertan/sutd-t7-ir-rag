# Apparatus for feeding tobacco.

## Abstract
Apparatus for feeding tobacco pneumatically into a ciga rette making machine comprises a duct 10 defined on one side by a wall 10B whose width i.e. in cross section in creases along the length of the duct from an inlet end 10A to an outlet end 10B , is concave in longitudinal section so that centrifugal force on the tobacco will urge the tobacco against that wall of the duct, and carries a splitter member 14 ar ranged to split the tobacco stream 12 flowing along the said wall into separate streams 12A, 12B passing along opposite sides of the splitter member, and to spread apart the two streams. From the outlet end of the duct, the air and tobacco pass into an air separator 22 from which the tobacco passes via a rotary seal 70 into the hopper of a cigarette making ma chine. The rotary seal may have special provision for prevent ing tobacco being trapped and crushed between the rotary part and the surrounding housing of the seal.
