# ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR

## Abstract
A thin layer electrochemical cell for rapid detection of toxic chemicals and chemical agents has a large area thin film sensing electrode 14 in contact with a very thin layer 17 of nonaqueous aprotic organic based electrolyte solu tion, and has a reference electrode 16 on the same surface 13 of a polymer membrane 11 . A counter electrode 22, 23 is positioned in a different plane beyond the edge of the large area sensing electrode.
