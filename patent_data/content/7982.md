# Method of manufacturing a self sealing pneumatic tire and a self sealing pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a self sealing pneumatic tire 10 with puncture sealing properties and a method of manufacturing such a tire. The puncture sealant properties of the self sealing tire are provided by a layer 15 com prised of a blend of a crosslinked polymeric material and an irradiation degraded polymeric material. The method of this disclosure comprises providing a layer 15 of rubber compound with a blend of polymeric materials, one of which degrades upon exposure to irradiation and another which crosslinks either on exposure to irradiation, by chemical reaction at vulcanization temperature, or both, assembling the layer into an unvulcanized tire in situ with the poly meric materials unaltered, vulcanizing the tire without alter ing the degradable polymeric material and irradiating the tire whereby the degradable polymeric material is degraded to a low viscosity to form a tacky material and the cross linkable polymeric material is crosslinked to form an elastic matrix for the degraded polymeric material, whereby the layer has puncture sealing properties.
