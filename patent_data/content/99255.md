# METHOD FOR TRANSFORMING PLANT CELLS

## Abstract
A method for transforming a plant cell in vitro with a Ti plasmid. The method involves inoculating the plant cell with a strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, containing the Ti plasmid, in the presence of an opine metabolite, that is normally synthesized only by a plant cell which has already been transformed by the Ti plasmid, or in the presence of the precursors of the opine metabolite. However, the opine metabolite or its precursors, which are used, must also be able to induce conjugative activity of the Ti plasmid.
