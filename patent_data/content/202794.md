A more preferred group of compounds occurs when Z is a group of the formulaEMI32.2 and especially so when R1 is a carboxy protecting group. One series of compounds worthy of note in the above more preferred group occurs when R2 iS hydrogen and furthermore when either R5 or R6 is hydrogen and the other is t butoxycarbonyl, and Y is 4 methylphenyl.Another series of compounds of note occurs when R2 is methylthio, and especially so when R1 is t butyl, R5 orR6 is hydrogen and the other is t butoxycarbonyl, and Y is 4 methylphenyl. The second of the two preferred groups of compounds of the compounds of Table 1 are the 7 S compounds, in other words, compounds of Formula 1 represented by the formula EMI33.1 A preferred group of the 7 S compounds is when either R5 or R6 is hydrogen and the other is an amino protecting group. The group of amino protected compounds contains a preferred group of compounds wherein R2 is a group of the formula COR8, and especially so when Y is phenyl or substituted phenyl and R3 and R4 are each hydrogen. A more preferred group of compounds occurs when Z is a group of the formula EMI33.2 wherein R1 is a carboxy protecting group. Especially desirable 7 S compounds in the group of above preferred compounds occurs when R7 is an acetyl group, i.e., when R8 is methyl, and especially so when R1 is an allyl group, either R5 or R6 is hydrogen and the other is t butoxycarbonyl, and Y is a phenyl group. The 7 substituted 2, 3 dihydro bicyclic pyrazolidinones of Formula I can be synthesized with a 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The cycloaddition reaction is represented by Scheme 1 Scheme 1EMI34.1 ylide ethylene IIn Scheme 1, R1, R2, R3, R4 R5, R6, Z and Y are as defined for Formula I, except that R5 and R6 of the ylide are not both hydrogen. In conjunction with the above process, it is preferable to derivatize with protecting groups any acidic groups on the ylide, ethylene, or bicyclic pyrazolidinone ring system ofFormula I represented by R1, R2, R3, R4 or Y. One such acidic group is the carboxyl group. The reaction in the above Scheme 1 is carried out in aprotic, preferably polar solvents. Examples of such solvents are the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl or aromatic cyano solvents. A preferred solvent for the above reaction is 1,2 dichloroethane. The temperature for the reaction is not critical. It is preferred that the reaction be carried out between about room temperature to about the reflux temperature of the solvent. A more preferred temperature is approximately the reflux temperature of the solvent. The reaction usually requires a period of about 1 to about 168 hours. The optimal reaction time can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction by conventional means such as chromatographic techniques thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or column chromatography , spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass spectrometry , or a combination of the two methods. The usual stoichiometry for the reaction in the above Scheme 1 is a 1 1 ratio of ylide to ethylene reactant. Of course, an excess of either reactant is permissible. The order of addition of either reactant is not critical. The regiospecificity of the above cycloaddition reaction is such that the 3 sulfonyl regioisomer is the predominant product. Selected examples have shown that the E vinyl sulfone isomer of the formulaEMI35.1 preferably Y is phenyl and R2is acetyl, enhances the yield of the 3 sulfonyl adduct. The stereospecificity of the reaction at C2 and C3 of the bicyclic pyrazolidinone is unpredictable.The reaction usually produces a mixture of stereoisomers at these positions. The stereospecificity of the cycloaddition at C7 of adduct Formula I is determined by the stereochemistry of the C4 position of the ylide.Thus, if a 4 S ylide is the starting material, the cycloadduct Formula I has 7 S stereochemistry. The compounds of Formula I can be converted to 7 substituted bicyclic pyrazolidinone antimicrobials and the corresponding intermediates according to the elimination reaction set forth below in Scheme 2 Scheme 2EMI36.1 I unsaturated system In the above Scheme 2, R1, R21 R3, R4, R5, R6, Z, and Y are as defined for Scheme 1. Again, it is preferred that acidic groups at R1, R2, R3, R4 and Y be derivatized with a protecting group. An example of such an acidic group is a carboxylic acid. For the above elimination reaction, the preferred solvent is dichloromethane. The elimination is conducted at a temperature from about 780C to about room temperature. A non nucleophilic base, such as 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.Oiundec 7 ene DBU , 1,5 diaza bicyclo 4.3 .0 non 5 ene DBN1, , triethylamine, orN methylmorpholine, is used to eliminate the elements of alkyl or aryl sulfinic acid. An excess of the nonnucleophilic base in relation to the saturated system is normally used. The preferred base is N methylmorpholine, as it does not racemize the C 7 position of either the saturated cycloadduct Formula I or the unsaturated system of Scheme 2. The compounds produced by the reaction inScheme 2 unsaturated system are intermediates to antimicrobial compounds. In order to convert the intermediates to the corresponding antimicrobial compounds, it is necessary to replace the amino protecting group at either R5 or R6 with an acyl group derived from a C1 to C30 carboxylic acid. The acyl groups employed are typically those used to achieve the same purpose when bonded to the 6 amino group of a penicillin or a 7 amino group of a cephalosporin. The first step for the acylation of a 7 protected amino bicyclic pyrazolidinone compound 7 protected amino nucleus products of Scheme 2 is the removal of the amino protecting group. The conditions for the removal of these groups are well known in the cephalosporin and penicillin arts. For example, the trimethylsilyl protecting group is removed by simple hydrolysis, the t butoxycarbonyl group is removed by acidic hydrolysis or acidolysis trifluoroacetic acid or a mixture of hydrochloric acid in acetic acid respectively and the allyloxycarbonyl group is removed as a palladium complex. Removal of the acid labile amino protecting groups usually yields the 7 amino nucleus as a salt.The salt of the nucleus is neutralized by conventional procedures before acylation. For instance, the removal of the t butoxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid leaves the trifluoroacetate salt of the resultant 7 amino nucleus. The salt is taken up in tetrahydrofuran and bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide is added to yield the corresponding neutralized 7 compound. The neutralized compound can be isolated or acylated in situ. The removal of the t butoxycarbonyl group with a mixture of hydrochloric acid in acetic acid yields the hydrochloride salt of the nucleus. The hydrochloride salt may be taken up in water and acetonitrile and a solution of K2HPO4 added to give the amino nucleus. The methods for the acylation of the neutralized 7 amino nucleus with the acyl side chain are similar to the methods for the acylation of 6 aminopenicillanic acid, 7 aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid and 7 aminocephalosporanic acid. One method is to simply combine the 7 amino nucleus with an acid chloride or acid bromide. The acid chloride or acid bromide may be formed in situ. Another method is to combine the 7 amino nucleus with the free carboxylic acid form of the side chain or its acid salt and a condensing agent.Suitable condensing agents include N,N disubstituted carbodiimides such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N diethylcarbodiimide, N,N di n propyl carbodiimide, N,N di iso propyl carbodiimide, N,N diallylcarbodiimide, N,N bis p dimethylaminophenyl carbodiimide, N ethyl N 4 ethylmorpholinyl carbodi imide and the like. Other suitable carbodiimides are disclosed by Sheehan in U.S. Patent No. 2,938,892 and by Hofmann et. al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,065,224. Azolides, such as N,N carbonyldiimidazole and N,N thionyldiimidazole, may also be used as condensing agents.Dehydrating agents such as phosphorus oxychloride, the alkoxyacetylenes and 2 halogenopyridinium salts such as 2 chioropyridinium methyl iodide, 2 fluoropyridinium methyl iodide, and the like may be used to couple the free acid or its acid salt with the 7 amino nucleus. Another acylation method entails first converting the free carboxylic acid form or the corresponding salt of the acyl side chain to the active ester derivative which is in turn used to acylate the nucleus. The active ester derivative is formed by esterifying the free acid form with groups such as p nitrophenol, 2,4 dinitrophenol, trichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol, N chlorosuccinimide, N chloro maleic imide, N chlorophthalimide, 2 chloro 4, 6 dimethoxy triazine, l hydroxy lH benzotriazole or l hydroxy 6chloro lH benzotriazole. The active ester derivatives can also be mixed anhydrides, formed with groups such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, iso butoxycarbonyl, trichloromethylcarbonyl or iso but 2 ylcarbonyl and the carboxylic acid form of the acyl side chain. The mixed anhydrides are formed by acylating the carboxylic acid function of the acyl side chain. Alternatively, the 7 amino nucleus can be acylated with the N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline EEDQ derivative of the acyl side chain. In general, the free acid form of the acyl side chain and EEDQ are reacted in an inert, polar organic solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, etc. . The resultant EEDQ derivative is used in situ to acylate the 7 amino nucleus. Once the 2,3 unsaturated bicyclic pyrazolidinones are acylated with the appropriate acyl group derived from a C1 to C30 carboxylic acid, they are converted to the corresponding antimicrobial final product form by removing any remaining amino, hydroxy and or carboxy protecting groups on the molecule. As discussed above, such removal methods are well known in the cephalosporin, penicillin and peptide arts. Once the carboxy groups are deprotected, the non toxic, metabolicallylabile ester forming group oral ester may be put in place on the desired carboxy groups at R1, R2, and R3 or R4. The methods for making the oral ester derivatives are well known in the cephalosporin and penicillin art. The pyrazolidinium ylide starting materials for the above cycloaddition reaction in Scheme 1 are synthesized according to the process depicted below inScheme 3. The process yields a mixture of C4 enantiomers of the ylide. Scheme 3EMI41.1 protected serine tosyl serine diazolidine yl ide The above Scheme depicts the synthesis of an enantiomeric mixture 4 t butoxycarbonylamino ylide starting materials. Ylide starting materials with different amino protecting groups are obtained from serine derivatized with a carboxy protecting group other than t butoxycarbonyl. The first step in the synthesis of the enantiomeric mixture of ylide starting materials, represented by Reaction 1 in the above Scheme, is the tosylation of the hydroxy group of the protected serine derivative. The serine derivative is tosylated in methylene chloride with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine and greater than one equivalent of pyridine. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. The tosylated serine obtained is cyclized to give the diazolidine. The cyclization, represented byReaction 2, entails adding the tosyl serine to a solution of 97 hydrazine in methylene chloride under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for approximately five hours. The final reaction in the synthesis of the enantiomeric mixture of pyrazolidinium ylide starting materials comprises the condensation of an aldehyde with a diazolidine. When Rs and R4 are different those skilled in the art will recognize that this final reaction will produce a mixture of E and Z isomers.The unsubstituted ylide when Ra and R4 are hydrogen is synthesized by combining the diazolidene reagent and 37 aqueous formaldehyde in methanol and stirring the mixture for twenty minutes at room temperature. The stereospecific synthesis of the pyrazolidinium ylides of Formula I is diagramed below in Scheme 4.Scheme 4EMI43.1 Protected serine acyl hydrazide N Trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazideChiral 1 Trifluoroacetyl diazolidine a hydroxide ionEMI43.2 Chirai diazolidineChiral yl Ide The above Scheme depicts the synthesis of chiral 4 5 t butoxycarbonylamino ylide compounds.Ylide compounds with the 4 R configuration are synthesized by starting with the protected D serine acyl hydrazide instead of the L isomer depicted above. Both 4 R or 4 S compounds with amino protecting groups other than t butoxycarbonyl are synthesized from the corresponding serine enantiomer substituted with an amino protecting group other than t butoxycarbonyl. The protected serine acyl hydrazide precursor of Scheme 4 is synthesized in a procedure analogous to B. Iselin and R. Schwyzer, Helv. Chim. Acta, 44, p.169 1961 . The precursor is then acylated with the trifluoroacetyl moiety, as set forth in Reaction 4 in the Scheme. The hydrazide precursor is acylated with an excess of ethylthio trifluorothioacetate ET TFA in ethanol. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 65 hours. The N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide obtained from Reaction 4 is cyclized with triphenylphosphine TPP and diethyl azodicarboxylate DEAD , as depicted above in Reaction 5. The stoichiometry of the cyclization ofReaction 5 has the N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide, phosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate reagent present in at least approximately a 1 1 1 molar ratio. The reaction will proceed in the presence of molar excesses above this ratio of any of the reactants. The cyclization is initiated by first combining in any order the solvent, the N trifluoroacetyl acyl hydrazide and the phosphine, and secondly adding the azodicarboxylate reagent. The temperature of Reaction 5 is not a critical parameter. The cyclization can be carried out at a temperature from approximately the freezing point to approximately the reflux temperature of the solvent.The preferred temperature is approximately room temperature. The duration of Reaction 5 can be from approximately five minutes to approximately twenty four hours. The progress of the cyclization can be monitored by standard methods e.g., thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, etc. The process is stopped when the monitoring method demonstrates that the reaction is substantially complete. The solvents for the cyclization are aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylenes ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or 1,4 dioxane chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, or chlorobenzene amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide and other solvents such as hexamethylphosphoramide. Tetrahydrofuran is the preferred solvent. It is also desirable, but not essential, to dry and deoxygenate the solvent before use in the process. While Reaction 5 in the above Scheme depicts the use of diethyl azodicarbonylate, the dimethyl and di iso propyl azodicarboxylate analogs can also be used in the reaction. The chiral l trifluoroacetyl diazolidine obtained from Reaction 5 is deacylated with dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The deacylation is repre sented as Reaction 6 in the Scheme. The deacylation entails generally suspending the chiral l trifluoroacetyl diazolidine in water and adding at least two equivalents of a dilute aqueous solution of either sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. For instance, a two fold excess of 1M sodium hydroxide solution can be used. It is preferred to have the initial pH of the solution from between about 11 to about 12. The resultant solution can be stirred from about 10 minutes to about 3 hours at a temperature from about 100C to about 250C. When the reaction is substantially complete the reaction solution is neutralized by the addition of dilute acid, such as 1N hydrochloric acid. The optimal reaction time for the deacylation can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction with conventional chromatographic techniques thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, or column chromatography , or spectroscopic methods, such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and mass spectrometry or a combination of both methods. A preferred time period is from between about 30 minutes to about 1.5 hours. The final reaction of Scheme 4, wherein the chiral diazolidines are converted to the chiral pyrazolidinium ylides, is carried out using the conditions described for the analogous reaction Reaction 3 in Scheme 3. The synthesis of the above diazolidine and pyrazolidinium ylide starting materials are further described by L.N. Jungheim and R. E. Holmes, European Patent Applications Nos. and references X 6711A and X 6739A respectively, filed this even date, herein incorporated by reference, which applications are related to U.S. Patent ApplicationNos. 728,734 and 728,733 respectively filed April 30, 1985. Those skilled will appreciate that amino protecting groups other than t BOC could be used in the above seguence. The ethylene starting materials in Scheme 1 are made by methods known in the art and or commercially available. The synthesis of some ethylene starting materials are also described in the Experimental Section below. The 2,3 unsaturated bicyclic pyrazolidinone antimicrobial compounds in Scheme 2 unsaturated system inhibit the growth of certain organisms pathogenic to man and animals. The antimicrobial compounds of the unsaturated system are compounds wherein the various amino, hydroxy and or carboxy protecting groups have been removed. The antimicrobial activity can be demonstrated in vitro using standard tube dilution techniques.The in vitro tests demonstrate that, in general, the 7 S isomers have better antimicrobial activity than the corresponding 7 R isomers or a mixture of the two isomers. Representative pathogens which are sensitive to the antimicrobial compounds include Staphylococcus aureus Xl.l, Streptococcus pyogenes C203, Streptococcus pneumoniae Park, Hemophilus influenzae 76 ampicillin resistant , Escherichia coli N10, Escherichia coli EC14, Escherichia coli TEM b lactamase producer , Klebsiella pneumoniae X26, Klebsiella pneumoniae KAE B lactamase producer , Klebsiella pneumoniae X68, Enterobacter aerogenes C32, Enterobacter aerogenes EB17, Enterobacter cloacae EB5 non p lactamase producer , Salmonella typhiX514, Salmonella typhi B35, Serratia marcescens X99,Serratia marcescens SE3, Proteus morganii PR15, Proteus inconstans PR33, Proteus rettgeri C24, Citrobacter freundii CF17, and the like.
