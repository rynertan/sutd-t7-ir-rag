# Heat treatment of steel rod.

## Abstract
A process for heat treatment of steel rod is disclosed in which steel rod is deposited on a conveyor in overlapping rings and subjected, while on the conveyor, to intermittent cooling and reheating. The objective of this treatment is repetitively to reverse the direction of heat flow paths associated with the overlapped rings such that the greater heat flow out of the more exposed places during the cooling phase is matched by greater heat flow in, at those same places, during the reheat phase. Apparatus suitable for carrying out the heat treatment process is also disclosed.
