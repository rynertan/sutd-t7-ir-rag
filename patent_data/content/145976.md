# HIGH SPEED MULTIPLYING DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER

## Abstract
A high speed four quadrant multiplier is current con trolled and uses a high speed differential output current digital to analog converter. Independent adjustment of the multiplying factor without changing the DC offset is accom plished. Also a true zero input signal will cause a true zero output signal and the operation of the multipler is extremely fast. The analog throughput of the multiplier is independent of the speed of the digital to analog converter.
