## Description
Improvements in or relating to Flowmeters This invention relates to flowmeters of the type comprising a cylindrical chamber having a rotor vane mounted therein for rotation about the axis thereof, an inlet port for inducing a vortex in said chamber so as to cause rotation of the rotor vane and sensing means for detecting rotation of the rotor vane. British Patent Specification No. 529615 discloses a flowmeter of the foregoing type. However, such flowmeters tend to be inaccurate when measuring a pulsating flow or if the flow stops suddenly because the rotor has a tendency to overrun and thus give a high reading. It is an object of the invention to provide a flowmeter which is not subject to this disadvantage. According to the invention, a flowmeter comprises a cylindrical chamber having a rotor vane mounted therein for rotation about the axis thereof, an inlet port for inducing a vortex in said chamber so as to cause rotation of the rotor vane, an outlet port and sensing means for detecting rotation of the rotor vane, one end wall of the cylindrical chamber being provided with at least one stator vane. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a transverse cross sectional view of a flowmeter in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view taken on the line 2 2 in Figure 1 and showing the line 1 1 on which the crosssection of Figure 1 is taken, Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken on the line 3 3 in Figure 1, Figure 4 is a diagram of an electrical circuit for use with the flowmeter shown in Figures 1 to 3, and Figure 5 is a diagram of an alternative electrical circuit for use with a flowmeter having a coil with a single winding. Referring to Figures 1 to 3, a flowmeter comprises a cylindrical chamber 10 having a Savonius rotor 12 mounted in bearings 14 and 16 for rotation about the axis of the chamber 10. The lower bearing 16 is a very loose fit and communicates with a sediment well 18. The effect of this is that, if any particles of sediment escape the various filters through which the incoming fluid passes and settle on the upper surface of the bearing 16, such particles drop through into the sediment well 18 rather than increasing the friction at the bearing. An inlet tube 20 is connected, via a tapering nozzle 22 to a port 24 in the cylindrical wall of the chamber 10.The port 24 is disposed near the bottom of the chamber 10, as viewed in Figure 2, and oriented so as to direct the fluid flow in an upwardly spiralling helical path towards an outlet port 26 which is connected to a correspondingly oriented outlet pipe 28. The foregoing orientation of the pipes 20 and 28 not only has the advantage of assisting in the production of the required helical flow within the chamber 10, but also allows the free ends of the pipes 20 and 28 to diverge, enabling the ports 24 and 26 to be disposed in closer proximity to one another than would otherwise be possible. A coil comprising two axially spaced windings 30 and 32 separated by an electrically conductive screen 34, is mounted surrounding the chamber 10 with the axis thereof in the plane of the screen 34 and perpendicular to the axis of the coil. Thus, when the rotor vane 12 is oriented in the plane of the screen 34, it acts as a single shorted turn secondary while, when it is out of the plane of the screen 34, it has a reduced effect on the windings 30 and 32. Four stator vanes 36, 37, 38 and 39 are located at the lower end of the cylindrical chamber 10. These stator vanes 36, 37, 38 and 39 have a braking effect on the rotor 12. This reduces any tendency of the meter to read high when measuring pulsating flow, due to the rotor 12 continuing to rotate during the intervals between pulses. It also reduces the possibility of the rotor overrunning if fluid flow stops suddenly. Turning now to Figure 4, the winding 30 is connected to the collector circuit and the winding 32 in the base circuit of a transistor 40 forming part of an oscillator 42. A capacitor 44, connected in parallel with the winding 30 determines the frequency at which the oscillator 42 operates, the remainder of the circuit thereof providing the required bias levels.The output of the oscillator 42 is connected, via an emitter follower circuit 46 to a capacitor resistor integrator 48 having a time constant significantly longer than the period of the oscillator 42 but significantly shorter than the maximum period of rotation of the rotor vane 12 when the flowmeter is in use. The output of the integrator 48 is connected to a feedback comparator 50. In use, as fluid flows from the inlet port 22 to the outlet port 24, the vane 12 rotates at a rate dependent on the volume rate of the fluid flow. The oscillator has two periods of alternate operation and non operation for each revolution of the vane 12 as the rotor moves from a position in which it acts as a shorted secondary to a position in which its effect on the windings 30 and 32 is minimal. For each such period of operation, the comparator 50 produces an output pulse. The output of the comparator 50 may be connected to a counter not shown or other data processing or recording equipment as required. Alternatively, instead of the outlet port 24, an outlet port may be provided in the end wall 52 of the chamber 10, Although this complicates the design of the bearing 14, it may be advanta,eous in some circumstances. The use of a Savonius rotor is not essential although it has been found to give better starting than a flat vane. The rotor may also have more than two blades, in which case a greater number of output pulses per revolution is produced by the comparator 50. The screen 34 between the windings 30 and 32 reduces the effect of other metal components in the viciniy,of the flowmeter. It may be omitted if the flowmeter is to be used in a location remote from other metal parts or where it is totally screened from such other metal parts. Figure 5 illustrates an alternative electrical circuit for use with a flowmeter in which the sensing coil has a single winding in place of the two windings 30 and 32. This single winding 60 is connected to the collector circuit of a transistor 62 forming part of an oscillator 64. The operating frequency of the oscillator 64 is determined by the coil 60 and two capacitors 66 and 68 connected in series, the necessary feedback being provided by a link between the interconnection between the capacitors 66 and 68 and two serially connected resistors 70 and 72 forming the emitter circuit of the transistor 62.The output of the oscillator 64 is connected to a detector circuit 72 which operates in the same manner as the detector formed by the circuits 46 and 48 of Figure 4. The output of the detector 72 may be connected to a comparator not shown similar to the comparator 50 of Figure 4. With either of the circuits shown in Figures 4 and 5, the coupling between the rotor vane 12 and the windings 30 and 32 or the winding 60, may be such that the oscillators 42 and 64 have alternate periods of operation and non operation, as already described. Alternatively, rotation of the vane 12 may be arranged to merely amplitude modulate the output of the oscillator in each case. The entire flowmeter is preferably housed in a metal enclosure which both serves as a magnetic screen and protects the meter from mechanical damage. If the cylindrical chamber itself is moulded in plastics material, the metal enclosure will also serve to contain the fluid should the flowmeter be subjected to a sufficiently high temperature to melt the plastics material, for example in a fire.
