# Method of preparing a polymeric coating composition.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a storage stable one part reactive liquid thermal curing polymeric coating composition from an isocyanate functional polymeric compound which has a substantial portion of its isocyanate groups masked with an isocvanate masking agent, and a crosslinking agent which is substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents. These liquid compositions are homogeneous even when free of solvents. Preferably the crosslinking agent is a crystalline polyol. The method involves the synthesis of a solubilizing oligomer which is formed by the partial reaction of the crosslinking agent and the unmasked isocyanate functional polymeric compound. The thermal curing of these compositions results in polymeric coatings which possess superior physical properties. These cured coatings are particularly useful in the manufacture of retroreflective sheeting.

## Description
METHOD OF PREPARING A POLYMERIC COATING COMPOSITIONTechnical Field This invention relates to a novel method of synthesizing storage stable, one part reactive, thermal curing, liquid homogeneous polymeric coating compositions.This invention particularly relates to the synthesis of such homogeneous liquid coating compositions from an isocyanate functional polymeric compound which has a substantial portion of its isocyanate groups blocked or masked with an isocyanate blocking or masking agent, and a crosslinking agent which is substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents and is preferably a crystalline poyol. This invention further relates to the coating compositions prepared according to this method, and to the cured pclymeric coatings which result from the thermal curing of these coating compositions.Background Art Polyurethane coating compositions prepared frond blocked polyurethane compounds are disclosed in numerous patents including U.S. Patent Numbers 3,583,943 3,846,378 3,248,371 3,267,078 3,694,389 3,711,571 4,046,7 4 3,993,849 3,857,818 3,621,000 and 3,926,875.However, all of the polyurethane coating compositions of the prior art suffer from at least one of the following defects They are moisture unstable and thus have poor shelf stability and short coating lives they are required to have solvent contents of greater than about 40 percent they cure to coatings which are unstable at temperatures greater than about 1000C and or are inflexible at temperatures below about OOC or they produce cured coatings which are inelastic, have poor tensile strengths, or are lacking in surface hardness. Additionally, another serious problem encountered with many of the cured polyurethane coatings provided by the prior art is that they have poor weatherability and yellow when used in exterior environments. The coatings prepared according to the method of the present invention, from blocked isocyanate functional polymeric compounds and insoluble crosslinking agents, preferably, crystalline polyols, have improved physical and chemical properties over the polyurethane coatings of the prior art. Such properties include high temperature stability, high tensile strength, impact resistance, resistance to degradation and abrasion upon exposure to exterior environments, and reduced tendency to yellow in exterior applications. Crystalline polyols have heretofore not been useful in preparing cured polyurethane films since they are substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents, which are necessary solvent systems for urethane manufacture. For example, tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate, a preferred crystalline polyol crosslinking agent, has been used as a crosslinker for urethane foams U.S 4,031,040 , but has not been used to any extent in urethane films or com osS tions due to its very limited solubility in aprotic solvents. While J. E. Pregler in Flexible Urethane Resins and Coating Materials Development , Contract No.N0019 700 C 0309, Naval Air Systems Command, Department of the Navy March 1971 disclosed the use of tris 2 hydroxy ethyl isocyanurate as a crosslinker for high performance urethane coatings, the systems disclosed were limited to one part moisture curing formulations which have the disadvantage of poor shelf stability, short coating lives and limited curing conditions. Additionally, since tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate has such limited solubility in common urethane solvents, a complex solvent system had to be devised. Moreover, the insolubility of the tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate limited the solids levels of these compositions to less than 60 percent by weight. The method of the present invention overcomes the problem of the limited solubility of crystalline polyol crosslinkers in aprotic solvents and allows these crosslinkers to be used in the synthesis of coating compositions, including polyurethane coating compositions.Disclosure of Invention The present invention provides a method of preparing a storage stable, one part reactive, thermal curing liquid polymeric coating composition, which is homogeneous even when free of solvent, from an isocyanatefunctional polymeric compound which has a substantial portion of its free isocyanate groups blocked with isc cyanate blocking groups, and a crosslinking agent which is substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents the method comprising the steps of a providing an isocyanate functional polymeric compound which has a substantial portion of the isocyanate groups masked by agents that can be removed by heating b adding a crosslinking agent to the masked isocyanate functional polymeric compound and alin o the crosslinking agent and the masked isocyanate functional polymeric compound to react at an elevated temperature for a period of time which is suffic nt to unmask no more than about one third of the masked isocyanate functional polymer, in order to partFal ly react the crosslinking agent and the unmasked isocyanate functional polymer so as to form an oligomer in which the unreacted portion of the crosslinking agent and the polymer are soluble anC c maintaining the reaction at the elevated temperature until a homogeneous liquid solution results. The method of the present invention allows coating compositions, such as polyurethane coating compositions, to be synthesized using crosslinking agents such as crystalline polyols, which are substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents. This is due to the fact that the reaction of the partially unmasked isocyanate functional polymer and the crosslinking agent creates an oligomer comprising the unmasked polymer with partial crosslinker functionality. This oligomer acts as an effective solubilizing agent for the balance of the crosslinking agent. The mixture is allowed to react at the elevated temperature until all of the crosslinking agent is dissolved. The resultant homogeneous liquid solution may be cooled to room temperature and stored, or sold as a storage stable, nonmoisture reactive polymeric coating composition.This coating composition may be thermally cured by further heating to provide a polymer having urethane or urea linkages. The thermally cured films or coatings thus produced possess an unusual balance of desirable physical and chemical properties such as, high tensile strength, low temperature flexibility and high temperature stability, exterior durability, superior elongation properties, solvent resistance, and a reduced tendency to yellow when exposed to exterior environments. The method of the present invention does not require the presence of solvents. Thus, the coating compositions prepared by this method are capable of comprising up to about 100 solids. This is extremely important in applications where it is desired to keep the level of hydrocarbon emissions at a minimum to meet pollution standards. Additionally, this factor becomes increasingly important as the cost of solvents increases. The coating compositions prepared by the method of the present invention are nonmoisture reactive and thus, are storage stable for long periods of time, i.e., greater than 3 to 4 years. Additionally, they enable manufacturing costs to be reduced since they don t require a moisture controlled environment in order to cure. The thermally cured films and coatings prepared from the coating compositions of the present invention can be formulated to have all of the following properties high impact resistance low temperature flexibility, i.e., a glass transition temperature Tg of less than 0 C, and preferably less than 1500C, with high temperature stability, i.e., at temperatures greater than 1000C and preferably at temperatures greater than 1500C tensile strengths greater than 150 kg cm2, and preferably greater than 200 kg cm2 superior elongation properties, ire., greater than 100 elongation and preferably greater than 150 elongation solvent resistance to even such harsh solvents as tetrahydrofuran and methylene chloride resistance to degradation and abrasion upon exposure to exterior environments and optical clarity with a resistance to yellowing upon exposure to exterior environments.Detailed Description The first step in the method of the present invention is the synthesis of an isocyanate functional polymeric starting compound.Preparation of the Isocyanate functional Polymeric Starting Compound Preferably the isocyanate funct ional polymeric starting compound is an isocyanate terminated polyurethane compound. Commercially available isocyanate terminated polyurethane compounds include polymers of polyoxytetramethylene glycol and toluene diisocyanate, available asAdiprenee L 100 from E. I. du Pont De Nemours and Company,Inc., and polymers of polyoxytetramethylene glycol and methylene bis 4 cyclohexyl isocyanate , available as Adiprene0LW 520 from E. I. de Pont De Nemours and Company,Inc. Alternatively, the isocyanate terminated polyuretl2ane may be prepared by methods well known in the art. For example, U.S. Patents 4,211,804 3,933,725 and E.N. Doyle in The Development and Use of Polyurethane Products, McGraw eill, Inc. 1971 , at pages 93 124, describe procedures for the preparation of isocyanate terminated polyurethanes. Generally, the preparation of polyurethanes involves the reaction of a polyol, polyether polyol, hydroxyl terminated polyester, acrylic polyol, polyester amide, or other polyfunctional active hydrogen compound with a diisocyanate or other polyisocyanate, preferably using an excess of the polyisocyanate. An extensive description of some of the useful techniques for preparing polyurethanes can be found in J. H. Saunders and K. C.Frisch, Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technologir,n PartII, Interscience New York 1964 , especially on pages 8 to 49, and in the various references cited therein Polyols useful in preparing the isocyanateterminated polyurethane compound are diols, triols, and combinations thereof. Such polyols include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,583,943 3,846,378 4,046,744 and 3,248,371. Other useful polyols are taught by E. N. Doyle in The Development and Use of Polyurethane Products, McGraw Hill, 1971. Preferred polyols include hydroxyterminated linear polyols prepared from oxiranes and lactones. These preferred polyols are exemplified by polyoxyethylene diols, polyoxypropylene diols and 2 oxepanone polymers of 2,2 oxybisethanol known as polycaprolactone diols. Useful polyisocyanates are those commonly employed in polyurethane synthesis, among these being aliphatic and cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, trimethyThexamethylene di iso cyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 4,4 methylenedicyclo hexyl diisocyanate, and the like aromatic diisocyanates such as toluene diisocyanates and 4,4 methylenediphenyl diisocyanate and higher polyisocyanates such as a triisocyanate, for example, the buiret of 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, commercially available as Desmodure N fromMobay Chemical Company. Other polyisocyanates which are useful for forming the isocyanate terminated polymer are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,846,378 3,621,000 3,926,875 3r993r849 4,046,744 and 3,694,389.Still other useful polyisocyanates are taught by Doyle in TheDevelopment and Use of Polyurethane Products, supra. It has been found that in order to produce cured polyurethane films which have optimal low temperature flexibility, exterior durability, and a reduced tendency to yellow, it is preferred to use linear dicls and aliphatic diisocyanates to prepare the isocyanate terminated polyurethane polymer. A particularly preferred linear diol is polycaprolactone having a formula weight of between about 500 and 2,000, preferably between 500 and 1,000.Particularly preferred aliphatic diisocyanates include 4,4 methylene dicyclohexyl diisocyanate, cyclohexane 1,4 diisocyanate, hexamethylene l ,6 diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, trimethyl hexamethyiene diisocyanate, methyl cyclohexyl diisocyanate, and tetramethylene 1,4 diiso cyanate. The most preferred aliphatic diisocyanate is 4,4 methylene dicyclohexyl diisocyanate, due to its ability to provide cured polyurethane films which have optimal exterior durability and tensile strength.4,4 Methylene dicyclohexyl diisocyanate is also most preferred due to its commercial availability, its low volatility, and the fact that each of its isocyanate groups are equally reactive. The equivalent ratio of polyisocyanate to polyol may vary between a slight excess of polyisocyanate to a large excess of polyisocyanate, i.e. from an equivalent ratio of about 1.01 1.00 NCO OH, to an equivalent ratio of about 4.00 1.00 NCO OH. Preferably the equivalent ratio of NnO OH is 2 1. Additionally, it is preferred that a typical urethane synthesis catalyst be used to prepare the isocyanate terminated polyurethane polymer. Exemplary catalysts are disclosed by Dole in The Development andUse of Polyurethane Products, supra. Preferred catalysts are those which do not promote trimerization of the diisocyanate such as tin, zinc, manganese, cobalt and zirconium compounds. Tertiary amines may also be used if they meet the nontrimerization requirement. Metal catalysts of tin and zinc are particularly preferred, with a combination of zinc 2 ethylhexoate and dibutyl tin dilaurate being most preferred. It is preferred that the urethane synthesis catalyst be present in a range from about 0.01 to 2.0 by weight based on the solids content of the formulations, with the concentration of 0.05 by weight being more preferred. For optimum physical strength of the cured polyurethane films it is most preferred to use a catalyst which is a combination of 0.05 by weight tin and 0.15 by weight zinc. If desired, a solvent which is inert to the reaction, such as benzene, toluene, xylene or similar unreactive hydrocarbons may be present in the reaction mixture in a concentration of up to about 50 parts by weight of solids. The inclusion of a nonreactive solvent is, of course, not desired where a composition having 100 solids is to be prepared. If a solvent is used it should be sufficiently low boiling so that it will vaporize when coated onto a surface in a thin film. Preferred solvents include 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, 2 2 ethoxy ethoxyethyl acetate, 2 butoxyethyl acetate, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, other similar esters ketones, chlorinated solvents, nitroaliphatic solvents, dioxane, and the like. In addition, to isocyanate terminated polyurethane compounds, other isocyanate functional polymers, such as isocyanate functional acrylic, may be utilized as the polymeric starting compound. The preparation of isocyanate functional acrylics is well known in the art, and is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,301,257 4,291r632j 3,929,744 and in the Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 20, paged 3305 3311 1976 , all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, polymers which can, by known reaction techniques, be converted to isocyanate functional polymers are also usefully employeed as the polymeric starting compound.For example, aminefunctional polymers can be converted into isocyanatefunctional polymers by the methods described in theEncyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York 1981 , Vol. 13, at pages 799 807, incorporated herein by reference. Masking or Blocking Agents A substantial portion of the isocyanatefunctionalities of the polymeric starting compound are either blocked, masked or joined to groups or moieties that can be removed by heating. By a substantial portion it is meant that more than about 70 percent of the isocyanate groups are masked or blocked, preferably more than 99 percent, and most preferably more than 99.9 percent. Isocyanate blocking agents are well known in the art. For instance, there can be used known blocking agents of the phenol type, lactam type, active methylene type, alcohol type, mercaptan type, acid amide type, imide type, amine type, imidazole type, urea type, carbonate type, imine type, oxime type and sulfite type. Blocking agents of the phenol type, oxime type, lactam type and active methylene type are used especially advantageously. Specific examples of blocking agents which may be utilized in the practice of this invention are as follows a Phenol type blocking agents Phenol, cresol, xylenol, nitrophenol, chlorophenol, ethylphenol, t butylphenol, hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid esters, 2,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxytoluene, etc. b Lactam type blocking agents E Caprolactam, 6 valerolactam, y butyrolactam, ss propiolactam, etc. c Active methylene type blocking agents Diethyl malonate, dimethyl malonate, ethyl acetoacetate, methyl acetoacetate, acetylacetone, t butylacetoacetate, etc. d Alcohol type blocking agents Methanol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, t butyl alcohol, n amyl alcohol, t amyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, methylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, methoxymethanol, glycolic acid, glycolic acid esters, lactic acid, lactic acid esters, methylol urea, methylol melamine, diacetone alcohol, ethylene chlorohydrin, ethylene bromohydoin 1,3 dichloro 2 propanol, hydroperfluoro alcohol, acetocyanohydrin, etc. e Mercaptan type blocking agents Butylmercaptan, hexylmercaptan, t butylmercaptan t dodecylmercaptan, 2 mercaptobenzothiazole, thiophenol, methylthiophenol, ethylthiophenol, etc. f Acid amide type blocking groups Acetoanilide, acetoanisidide, acetotoluide acrylamide, methacrylamide, acetamide, stearylamide, benzamide etc. g Imide type blocking agents Succinimide, phthalimide maleimide, etc. h Amine type blocking agents Diphenyl amine, phenylnaphthyl amine, xylicine, n phenylxylidine, carbazole, aniline, naphthy amine, butyl amine, dibtyl amine, butyiphenyl amine, etc. i Imidazole type blocking agents Imidazole, 2 ethylimidazole, etc. j Urea type blocking agents Urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, ethylene thiourea, 1,3 diphenylurea, etc. k Carbamate type blocking agents Phenyl N phenylcarbamate, 2 oxazolidone, etc. 1 Imine type blocking agents Ethyleneimine, etc. m Oxime type blocking agents Formaldoxime, acetaldoxime, acetoxime, methylethylketoxime, diactyl monoxime, benzophenone oxime, cyclohexanone oxime, etc. n Sulfite type blocking agents Sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, etc.Additional isocyanate blocking agents are taught by Doyle in The Development and Use of Polyurethane Products, supra. The choice of which blocking agent to use is largely dependent upon the intended use of the resultant coating composition. For example, volatile blocking agents, i.e., blocking agents which volatilize at temperatures between about 90 and 2600C are preferred when preparing tough films and coatings for exterior applications. Volatile blocking agents will result in a cured coating having maximum crosslink density since the volatile blocking agent will volatilize and will not be available for competition with the crosslinking agent for available isocyanate groups. However, nonvolatile blocking agents, i.e., blocking agents which volatilize at a temperature which is higher than about 2600C are advantageous when the blocking isocyanate functional polymer is to be cured between two air impervious layers.Volatile blocking groups would cause blisters or voids to fonn in the cured composition. Preferred blocking agents for making tough, durable polymeric coatings and films are oximes or active methylene type blocking agents. The most preferred blocking agents are 2 butanoxime, also commonly known as methyl ethyl ketoxime, ethyl acetoacetate, and t butylacetoacetate. The equivalent ratio of blocking agent to isocyanate equivalent present in the isocyanate functional polymer is preferably between about 0.7 to 1.5, and most preferably between 1.0 to 1.1. If the blocking agent is not present in a concentration of more than about 0.7 equivalents blocking agent to isocyanate equivalent yellation will prematurely occur upon mixing the polymer with the crosslinker. Generally the blocked isocyanate functional polymer is prepared by mixing the blocking group and the isocyanate functional polymer as is described by Saunders and Frisch in Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technology, supra, or by Doyle in The Development and Use ofPolyurethane Products, supra, incorporated herein by reference. Additional references which describe the manufacture of blocked isocyanate polymers include U.S.Patents, 4,242,248 4,2û0,944 and 3,830,785, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. If desired, a solvent which is inert to the reaction, such as benzene toluene, xylene or similar unreactive hydrocarbons may be utilized. However, the use of a solvent is not required and is, of course, not desired where a composition containing 100 solids is to be prepared. Again, if a solvent is used it is preferred that it be sufficiently low boiling that it will vaporize when coated onto a surface in a thin film. Alternatively, commercially available blocked isocyanate polymers such as Adiprene B 16, available fromE. I. du Pont De Nemours and Co., may be employed. As an alternative to employing well known blocking agents to block the isocyanate functionality of the polymer, polymeric materials may be utilized which inherently contain masked isocyanate functionalities, which can be unmasked by heating. For example, cyclic nitrile adducts containing two or more cyclic nitrile functional groups enter into a ring opening addition reaction in the presence of heat and crosslinking agents to result in cured polymers containing urethane and or urea linkages. The preparation of cyclic nitrile adducts is described in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,531,425 3 652,507 3,702,320 and 4,049,007, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Crosslinking Agents The second step in the process of the present invention is the addition of a crosslinking agent, which is substantially insoluble in aprotic solvents, to the blocked or masked isocyanate functional polymer. By substantially insoluble it is meant that the crosslinking agent is less than 5 percent, preferably less than 1 percent, and most preferably less than 0.1 percent by weight soluble in aprotic solvents. The crosslinking agent and masked or blocked isocyanate functional polymer are allowed to react at an elevated temperature which is sufficient to unmask or unblock no more than about one third of the isocyanate functionalities The elevated temperature at which the reaction is allowed to occur is preferably about the minimum dissociation temperature for the particular isocyanate blocking or masking agent.The minimum dissociation temperature is the t mperature at which greater than about 0.1 percent of the isocyanate groups of the polymeric compound are unblocked or unmasked. This temperature for any particular isocyanate masking or blocking agent can be found by determining the temperature at which an isocyanate group absorbtion appears in the infrared spectrum of an isocyanate functional polymer which has substantially all, i.e., more than about 99.9 , of its free isocyanate groups blocked or masked by the particular blocking or masking group.Generally the minimum dissociation temperature will be between about 90 and 260 C. While temperatures higher than the minimum dissociation temperature may be used, at higher temperatures the reaction is more difficult to control and may result in premature gellation of the polymer. The reaction may take place in the presence or absence of an inert organic solvent. However, where a coating composition having 100 solids is desired, no solvents are present. After the reaction mixture becomes homogeneous, the reaction is allowed to continue at the elevated temperature for a period of time sufficient to insure that a quantity of the solubilizing oligomer is formed which is sufficient to dissolve the remainder of the unreacted crosslinking agent. Usually heating for about 20 to 90 minutes, depending on the temperature, is sufficient to insure that enough of the solubilizing oligomer isFormed. The homogeneous solution is then cooled to room temperature and may be stored or sold as a stable polymeric coating composition.If an insufficient quantity of solubilizing oligomer has been formed, the crosslinking agent will precipitate upon cooling to form a heterogenous mixture. This problem can be corrected by heating the mixture as indicated above until a sufficient quantity of solubilizing oligomer has been formed. Preferred crosslinking agents are crystalline polyols having three or more active hydrogen groups. The crystalline polyol crosslinking agent may possess amine, carboxylic, or mercapto functionalities or any combination thereof, such that the total number of active hydrogen groups per molecule is greater than or equal to 3. The crosslinking agent may be a liquid or solid. While the method of the present invention relates particularly to the use of crosslinking agents which are insoluble in aprotic solvents, it is also useful with crosslinking agents which are soluble in aprotic solvents. Particularly preferred insoluble crosslinking agents are low molecular weight, i.e., less than about 500, crystalline polyols because they provide cured coatings having the most desirable physical properties. In particular, cured coatings crosslinked by tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate, pentaerythritol, trimethylol propane and trimethylol ethane are mc L e resistant to yellowing when exposed to external environments, are more durable, and are more extensible than any of the crosslinked polymeric urethane or urea coatings known to the prior art. Other useful low molecular weight crystalline polyols include isocyanurates such as tris hydroxy methyl isocyanurate, tris 2 hydroxy 3 chloropropyl isocyanurate, and tris 2 hydroxy propyl isocyanurate.Additionally useful low molecular weight polyols are triols produced by the substitution of lower alkyl C1 C8 groups on the second carbon atom of glycerol. Such triols include trimethylolethane, etc. While they are not particularly preferred, higher molecular weight, i.e., above 500, crystalline polyols are useful crosslinking agents. Useful higher molecular weight crosslinking agents are triols produced through the addition condensation of lactones and oxiranes to glycerol or isocyanurate triols. Included among these triols are polycaprolactone polyols, and polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene derivatives of hydroxyalkyl isocyanurates. The equivalent ratio of isocyanate group both blocked and unblocked to active hydrogen of the crosslinking agent is preferably within the range of about 0.8 1.0 to 2.0 1.0, and is most preferably about 1.0 1.0. All of the crosslinking agent may be added to the blocked isocyanate functional polymer at the time of preparing the homogeneous coating composition. Optionally, only a portion, for example, 2 to 10 , need be added at this stage, with the remainder being added to the coating composition at the time of curing. To obtain a cured polymeric coating the homogeneous coating composition is subjected to a standard cure by heating to a temperature which is at least equal to the minimum dissociation temperature for the particular blocking group used. This temperature will normally be between about 100 and 1600C. The time required for curing is dependent upon the curing temperature and is normally between about 10 minutes and 16 hours. It is preferred when preparing a polyurethane coating that a typical urethane catalyst be added to the coating composition before curing. The preferred catalyst is a combination of 0.13 percent by weight dibutyl tin laurate and 0.17 percent by weight zinc 2 ethylhexoate. The heat curable compositions of this invention are extremely useful in all types of applications where the article may be baked after application of the coating. A few of the most important uses for this type of coating include coatings for metals, paper, textiles, leather, wood, ceramics, brick, plastic, rubber, stone and concrete services. smile it is preferred to use the coating compositions in a 100 percent solids form, the viscosity of such high solids coatings may be too high for some coating processes. The viscosity of the coating composition may be adjusted by addition of an inert or relatively volatile protic solvent to achieve the appropriate viscosity range for the particular coating process. Such solvents include lower alcohols such as butanol, 2 methoxy ethanol, 2 ethoxy ethanol, and 2 butoxy ethanol.For most coating operations the solvent content need not be greater than about 50 percent by weight and is preferably between about 10 and 40 percent by weight. The heat curable coating compositions made according to the method of the present invention are extremely useful in the manufacture of retroreflective sheeting, in particular, embedded lens retroreflective shceting. Methods of Inaking embedded lens retroreflective sheeting are well known in the art, and are taught by U.S. Patent No. 2,407,680 to Palmquist et al. As discussed hereinabove, cured polymer coatings made according to the method of the present invention, particularly those crosslinked with low molecular weight crystalline polyols, possess superior physical properties including impact resistant, low temperature flexibility and high temperature stability, superior elongation properties, external durability, and resistance to yellowing. Exterior durability and resistance to yellowing upon exposure to exterior environments are essential to the performance of retroreflective sheeting, particularly when used in exterior applications. Additionally, the polymers of the present invention are most advantageously used as the bead bond layer of retroreflective sheeting. The invention is further illustrated but is not intended to be limited by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example 1 Preparation of a storage stable, heat curable polyurethane coating composition The isocyanate 4,4 methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate 150 grams, 1.14 equivalents was combined with 86.0 grams of 2 2 ethoxy ethoxyethyl acetate and 0.35 grams of dibutyl tin dilaurate in a reaction vessel.Polycaprolactone, formula weight 530, commercially available as Niax polyol PCP 0200 from Union Carbide 160.0 grams, 0.605 equivalents was dissolved in 86.0 grams of 2 ethoxy ethyl acetate. The polyol solution was then added to the isocyanate solution under a nitrogen atmosphere with rapid agitation while maintaining the reaction temperature at from about 40 to 450C. This temperature was maintained until a free isocyanate content NCO of 3.5 was achieved.Methylethyl ketoxime 43.2 grams, 0.496 equivalents was then added to the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature at from 40 to 450C until the isocyanate NCO absorption in the infrared spectrum disappeared. Trist2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate 42.3 qrms, 0.4B , c auivalents was then a kls 3 to the reaction mixture as a solid powder. The temperature was increased to 1150C and held at this temperature for 30 minutes. A homogeneous liquid polyurethane coating composition resulted which had a viscosity of 9,400 centipoise, a solids content of 66.4 by weight, and a free isocyanate content of less than 0.1 . Example 2 Preparation of a solventless, heat stable, heat curable polyurethane coating composition The materials and quantities used in Example 1 with the exception of solvents, were used to prepare a solventless coating composition by the following method.The 4,4 methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate and the tin catalyst were charged to the reaction flask and the molten polycaprolactone was added at a rate so that the reaction mixture was maintained at 65 750C. Methylethyl ketoxime was added at a rate which allowed the reaction mixture to reach 900C. When the isocyanate absorption in the infrared spectrum disappeared, tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate was added as a dry powder in a single charge. The reaction temperature was raised to 115 1200C and held at this tem perature for 20 minutes to achieve a homogeneous liquid solution. The resulting solventless liquid coating composition had a viscosity of 1500 cps at 1150C. The solventless solution was a very viscous semi solid at 200C, but was flowable and processable at 650C. Example 3 Preparation of a heat curable polyurethane coating composition from a partially blocked polyurethane and a crosslinking agent The isocyanate terminated polyurethane compound was prepared as in Example 1. Methylethyl ketoxime 29.0 grams, 0.334 equivalents was added as in Example 1 while maintaining the temperature at 40 450C for 2 hours. Solid tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate was then added and the temperature of the mixture was increased to 800C until a homogeneous liquid solution was obtained. When the infrared spectrum showed no isoyanate peak the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. This solution required that 31.6 grams 0.323 equivalents of tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate be dissolved in it by heating to 1000C in order to achieve a heat curable liquid coating composition. Example 4 Evaluation of crosslinking agents Blocked polyurethane compounds were prepared as in Example 1. Crosslinking agents were later added and the mixture was heated to 1150C to achieve a homogeneous liquid polyurethane coating composition. The crosslinkers were evaluated as shown in Table 1, by coating the heat curable solutions onto an alkyd coated release paper to form 0.05 millimeter dry films, and curing for ten minutes at 1500C.

Example 6 Ethyl acetoacetate as a blocking group An isocyanate terminated polyurethane was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1. Zinc 2,4 pentanedionate 0.061 gm was then added to the polyurethane followed by the dropwise addition of ethyl acetoacetate 64.5 ginks, 0.496 equivalents . The reaction mixture was maintained at between 90 950C for 2 hours, and then allowed to cool to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. An infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture evidenced a small percentage of isocyanate groups which were not blocked. The reaction mixture was then heated to 650C and trisC2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate 42.3 gms., 0.485 equivalents was added as a dry powder. An exothermic reaction occurred, reaching a temperature of 79 C. The temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to 90 C for 1 hour to obtain a homogeneous liquid solution. Upon cooling a liquid polyurethane coating composition was obtained which had a viscosity of 35,000 cps and a solids content of 80.8 percent by weight. When coated as a film and thermally cured at 1500C for 10 minutes a cured polyurethane film was formed which had an elongation value of 310 , and a tensile strength value of 185 kg cm2.
