# Electrode for use in electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
An electrode, for use in an electrolytic cell, which elec trode is associated with a reference electrode adjacent to a sur face of said electrode, in which the electrode comprises at least two spaced apart members, at least one of which is foraminate and which comprises an operative electrode surface, and in which the reference electrode is positioned between and spaced apart from said members. A reference electrode may be associated with an anode, and a reference electrode may be associated with a cathode, and the potentials associated with various cell parameters may be monitored, for example over potentials at the anodes and cathodes.
