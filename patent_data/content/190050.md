# Method for preparing small vesicles using microemulsification.

## Abstract
A method is provided for preparing small less than 2000 Ã… lipid vesicles in commercial quantities by mic roemulsifying lipid compositions using very high shear forces generated in a homogenizing apparatus operated at high pressures at a selected temperature. These vesicles are suitable for various biological applications including target ing of tumors in a body for diagnosis and treatment.
