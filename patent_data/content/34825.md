# REMOVAL OF RESIDUAL ACRYLONITRILE MONOMER

## Abstract
Concentration of residual acrylonitrile monomer is reduced in acrylonitrile copolymers or water in which acrylonitrile is polymerized to a level of less than about 100 ppm by reacting therewith ammonia or ammonium hydrox ide, thioalcohols, hydrogen sulfide and its salts, and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, phosphates, and silicates.
