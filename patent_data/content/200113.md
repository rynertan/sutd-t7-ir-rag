# A METHOD OF SOLID PHASE NUCLEIC ACID HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY INCORPORATING A LUMINESCENT LABEL

## Abstract
A method of solid phase nucleic acid hybridization assay which incorporates a first fragment of nucleic acid bound to a solid carrier comprising water insoluble particles and a second fragment of nucleic acid bound to a luminescent label. Hybridization occurs while the solid carrier is sus pended and the luminescence is measured after the solid carrier is concentrated by microfiltration.
