# Annular corrugator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for forming annular corrugations in a metal tube 11 . The tube is advanced through a series of annular dies 30 min 40 min having helical ribs 30 sec 40 sec formed therein, each die engaging only part of the circumference of the tube. As the tube rotates the dies rotate also to maintain the ribs therein in contact with a deepening wall corrugation 11a 11f . The dies are desirably arranged in pairs contacting opposite sides of the tube. Downstream dies can form new corrugations between those produced by upstream dies.
