# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A SUPPORT FOR A PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER AND THE SUPPORT PRODUCED BY THE PROCESS

## Abstract
A process for producing a support for photographic pa per is described, having a layer hardened by irradiation with electron beams on at least one surface of the paper support, comprising coating a mixture of an organic com pound capable of being hardened by irradiation with elec tron beams and a white pigment on a shaping face, harden ing the layer by irradiation with electron beams in that state, adhering the resulting coated layer to a base paper by an adhesive, and then peeling off the base paper having the coated hardened layer from the shaping face. A support for photographic paper is produced by the process. The support has superior properties with respect to the surface configuration and good whiteness.
