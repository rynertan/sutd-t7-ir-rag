# ASEXUAL PROPAGATION OF PINE TREES

## Abstract
A method is provided for asexually propagating pine trees, preferably loblolly pine, by vegetative propagation. According to this method, pine seedlings are hedged by severing the main stem and detaching the branches so that only one lateral branch is left intact and attached to the remaining main stem. The hedged seedlings are maintained under conventional growth conditions at least until elon gated shoots having juvenile characteristics are obtained at the cut end of the main stem. The elongated shoots are then severed from the main stem and rooted by conventional means.
