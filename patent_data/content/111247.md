# Photovoltaic device.

## Abstract
A PIN junction photovoltaic device using a P type or N type semiconductor having an optical band gap of not less than about 1.8 eV and a dark conductivity of not less than about 10 ⁸ Ω.cm ¹ at 20 C. in the layer positioned on the opposite side to incidence of light. The photovoltaic device has an improved efficiency.
