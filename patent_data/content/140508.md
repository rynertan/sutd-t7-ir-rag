# Method of coalescing laser beams.

## Abstract
A method of coalescing two or more laser beams employs an optical merging element such as a polarization beam splitter 7 to make the laser beams substantially merged into a single laser beam of multiplied power. In the merged laser beam, however, the original laser beams cannot easily be perfectly aligned with each other. In order to have the laser beams perfectly mingled or coalesced at the position where they are focused on an object to be processed or an original to be read out or a recording medium 25, the original laser beams substantially merged into a single laser beam are collimated so that the collimated laser beams may be directed to the same focusing position on the object. To collimate the original laser beams in the merged beam, a part 8a of the merged beam 7a is split out and passed through a converging lens 9 to cause the original laser beams to be focused to points on a pinhole plate 10, and the direction of the original laser beams are corrected to make the laser beams focused to the same point on the pinhole plate or coincide with the pinhole 10a. By making these laser beams coincide with the pinhole, these laser beams are consequently collimated so that they can be focued to the same point on said object, whereby the laser beams are coalesced in effect.
