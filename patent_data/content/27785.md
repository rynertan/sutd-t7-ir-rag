The roll pair further is characterized in that the side plates 16 on opposed sides of said roll package are arranged to take up roll forces via two end members 18 , and that the roll package is arranged so as directly and or indirectly to rest against the end members 18 . A further characterizing feature is that said end members 18 are arranged so as to permit adjustment of the roll dis tance, so called roll gap adjustment.
