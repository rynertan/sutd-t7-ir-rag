## Description
This invention relates to a modular reinforced concrete element for building prefabrication. In the field of building prefabrication by means of reinforced concrete elements, various techniques are h novm which allow a number of elements to be set up in suitably equipped shops and later assembled together at the job site to produce a desired building or structure. The main problem encountered in designing reinforced concrete prefabricated elements is that of producing modules which can be manufactured on an industrial, and accordingly repeatable, basis but are sufficiently flexible in application to afford adequate freedom in architectural design. A further problem, unsolved heretofore, is originated by the very characteristics of the material employed, i.e. the heavy weight of the ultimate structure. The latter factor imposes serious limitations on the economy of the prefabricate since, on account of today s high transportation costs, it can only be conveniently used if the pre fabrication shop happens to be located zt a relatively modest distance from the construction site. That distance will be largely dependent in practice on transportation costs and the weight of the prefabricate being shipped. Accordingly the task of this invention is to provide an element as indicated, which can be pre fabricated using repeatitive industrial techniques such as to lower costs pnd increase the nrbdlletion output. Within this task it is an object of the invention to provide a self supporting modular element which can be readily assembled to other similar or complementary elements. It is another object of this invention to provide an element as indicated, which can either be implemented as a structural bearing element for subsequent completion at the job site or as a completed and finished element. Yet another object of the invention is to provide an element as indicated, which has a relatively light weight and small dimensions, thereby its erection at the construction site requires no heavy duty construction equipment. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task and objects as well as yet other objects such ss will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a modular reinforced concrete element for building prefabrication, characterized in thpt it comprises a self slnrorting frame of reinforced concrete having a substantially L like cros sectional eon fi guration, said frame being adapted for association with other like frames by means of mechanical fastening and sealing devices. Further features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given herein by way of example and not of limitation with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is an isometric view of this element Figure 2 is a cross sectional viev of two such elements laid side by side Figure 3 illustrates a complementary corner element Figure 4 is a schematical isometric view of the element casting form Figure 5 shows a section taken through the form in the open condition thereof Figure 6 is a perspective view of a building constructed with prefabricated elements according to the invention and Figure 7 is a sectional view taken through the building of Figure 6. With reference to the drawing figures, the modular element of this invention comprises a frame 1 having an angle or I like cross sectional configuration which includes a first raised flange or rib 2 and second flenffl on rib 3 extending in the F me plane as the panel infilling to be obtained, for example, directly by means of a slab 4 cast concurrently with said frame. The element configuration provides in practice a self supporting frame or relatively light weight and small modular dimensions, which can be installed in combination with other similar elements without requiring the availability of any special construction equipment. Thus, the erection of a building, and construction work, may proceed even in the absence of cranes or hoists, and can be carried out by comparatively unskilled labor, since the connection of any one element to adjacent ones is effected by means of throughgoing bolts 5 with the possible interposition at the resulting joint 6 of a sealant 7. The bolts 5 are led through holes 8 provided in the rib 2. To accomplish corner joints, a complementary corner element 9 is provided which comprises a straight molding whose L like cross section shape matches the cross sectional shape of the frame 1 and has a set of holes 10 along both its cross section pieces or flanges. The cited modular elements are prepared in a form 11 having a middle diaphragm 12 made rigid to a base 13 and two movable half forms 14 and 15 for shakeout purposes. The form 11 has a considerable length dimension, and enables the formation of two rows of elements, indicated at 16 and 17 in Figure 4, which are separated from each other by intervening partition diaphragms 18. By inserting in the form temporary filling elements, apertures may be obtained in the plate 4 to provide apertured modular elements. By removing the diaphragms 18, multiple elements may be obtained which would be particularly suitable for roof and floor applications. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate an exemplary building incorporating the modular elements of this invention, wherein the walls are formed with filled elements 19 and apertured elements 20, corner elements 21, and roof plates 22. The assembling procedure is quite straightforv.ard and readily carried out, thereby the resulting building and its installation procedure lend themselves well for erection in such emergencies as are encountered in disaster situations. In fact, in this particular csse,tbe 2vailability is highly arpreciated of light weight prefabricates which can be easily sransizorsed aa installed without involving the use of constructional equipment and machinery. It should be further noted that this reinforced concrete prefabricate can also be disassembled after use and recovered for further installations. From the latter standpoint, it would be specially advantageous for use at temporarily set up job sites, it combining the features of a concrete construction with the versatility of a readily assembled and disassembled structure. This element may also be utilized to produce light and thin sheds so arranged spatially as to be self supporting. Furthermore, reservoirs, either fully or in part embedded in the ground, may be constructed to produce svYimming pools. It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, by providing a simple assembly type prefabricated element of either standard or prestressed reinforced concrete construction with which different structures can be erected to suit a variety of application requirements. Of course, this same inventive concept may be variously embodied without departing from the scope of the invention0
