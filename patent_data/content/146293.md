# Time slot interchanger for fast circuit switching.

## Abstract
A fast circuit switching system that establishes a circuit for each packet sized data communication. A time slot inter changer 5100 included in the system network 5000 has a sequential access, circulating control memory 5445 , the con tents of which can be rapidly and frequently changed with mini mal impairment of time slot interchanger throughput. Such changes are effected by controlling the transmission of infor mation concerning established connections, from a control memory output register 5446 31 to a control memory input register 5446 0 and by controlling the transmission of infor mation concerning new connections, to the control memory in put register.
