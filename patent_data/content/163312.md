# IMMUNOASSAY

## Abstract
In an immunoassay, ultrafine particles having an aver age particle size of 0.2 Âµm or smaller and sensitized with a substance, which has reactivity with the materials to induce a nonspecific immunoreaction, are added to a sample to inhibit the nonspecific immunoreaction. The above im munoassay can avoid the influence of nonspecific factors more effectively, thereby permitting accurate measurements on the concentrations of antigens in samples such as blood, urine, body fluid and the like.
