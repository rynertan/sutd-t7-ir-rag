More detailed explanation is made below.i In the case cf AÚ beingEMI7.1 alpha 4 oxo 2 azetidinyl substituted imino thiazolyl acetic acid derivative III or reactive derivative thereof is reacted with 3 substituted cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivative II followed, ii necessary, by release of any protective group s . ii In. te case of A1 being a pyridylthio group alpha 4 oxo 2 azetidinyl substituted imino thiazolyl acetic acid derivative III or reactive derivative thereof is reacted with 3 pyridylthiomethyl cephem 4 carboxyli acid derivative II , and then the formed compound IV is reacted with halogen compound cf formula EMI7.2 followed, if necessary, by release of any protective group s to give the compound I . The reaction of compound III with compound iT that is, amidation reaction is usually performed in a solvent under cooling at room temperature or below. Any solvents which do not take part in the reaction can be used. Examples of the solvent usually used are organic solvents such as dioxane, dichloroethane, ether, ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, anisole, chloroform, dimethylformamide these solvents may be used alone or in appropriate combination. A compound III may be a free carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof. Suitable examples of the derivative reactive are mixed acid anhydrides, acid anhydrides, acid halides, active esters, active amides, acid azides.When using the compound III in the form of a free carboxylic acid t is preferred to use a condensing agent such asN,N dicyclo hexylcarbodiimide or N,N diethylcarbodi jinide. According to the kind of reactive derivative of carboxylic acid used, it may be preferred for smooth reaction to operate in the presence of a base. Examples of such a base are inorganic bases such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamnne, dlmethylaniline, pyri dine.

Examples of the solvent usually used are organic solvents such dimethysulfoside, dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, chloroform, dichloromethane, ether acetate, ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane. An equivalent amount or an excess of compound V to compound IV is usuali used i the reaction. The reaction is usually performed at room temperature or under cooling. Tile removal of a protecting group from the reaction product thus obtained is easily performed, when the group is tri loweralkyrsilyl, by contact with water and when the group is benzhydryl, trityl, tert butyl, fornyl, etc., by using an acid such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid anisole mixture, hydrobremic zcid acetic acid mixture, hydrochloric acid dioxane mixture. Process 2 EMI11.1 In the above formulae, Z represents a halogen atoms, and R10 represents a lower alkyl group. Other symbols are 3s defined above.

This first reaction can be performed in 1 step or in 2 steps. The above reaction proceeds easily at room temperature. When performing the reaction in 2 steps, the 1st step may be performed at room temperature and the 2nd step may be performed under cooling. Thus the reaction conditions may be changed for each step. Thus, the compound A having protective groups silyl type groups is formed. Then the reaction solution containing compound A is reacted with compound of formula III cr reactive derivative thereof2 and, in tne case of A1 being pyridylthio, reacted further With halogen compound of formula V after removing the protective group s , the desired compound I is obtained. Process 3 EMI13.1 Compounds Ia having 1 substituted pyridiniothiomethyl at the 3 position of tbe cephem nucleus can be produced by reacting 3 pyridinylthiomethyl cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivative VIII with compound V , and then, if necessary, removing the protective group s The reaction conditions are similar to those for Process i ii in the case of A1 being pyridylthio.Process 4 EMI13.2 Process 5 EMI14.1 In the above formulae, R12 represents a hydrogen atom or a tri lower alkylsilyl group COOR8 represents COOH, COO protective group, or COO X represents an anion when COOR8 is COOH or COO protective group however, X does not exist if COOR8 represents COO and R13 represents an acyloxy group or a halogen atom According to Process 4, compounds I can also be produced by reacting 7 amino or tri lower alkylsilyl amino 3 1 substituted pyridino thiomethyl cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivative of formula IX with 4 oxo 2 azetidInyl substituted imino thiazolylacetic acid of formula III or reactive derivative thereof. Examples of acyloxy in the definition of R13 are acetoacetoxy, acetoxy, propionyloxy, iso propionyloxy, butyryloxy, iso butyryloxy, pentyloxy, etc. The reaction is usually performed in a solvent under cooling at room temperature or below.

A catalyst such as sodium iodide or potassium iodide may be added for promoting the reaction.The reaction proceeds easily at room temperature or under heating. A salt of the formula I compound can be produced by performing a foregoing production process using a salt of the starting compound, or by applying a saltforming reaction to the free formula I compound.
