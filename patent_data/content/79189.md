# IMPROVEMENTS IN VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A vehicle suspension system provides independent suspension for each wheel 2, 3, 4, 5 , with the load on each wheel being supported by a gas spring 6, 7, 8, 9 which has a volume of gas for supporting the load, and a volume of hydraulic fluid through which movement of the wheel is transmitted to the gas. In order to produce substantially constant vehicle handling for all load conditions of the vehicle, the suspension for the rear wheels 4, 5 includes a torsion bar 14 , and a connection 15 is provided between the hydraulic fluid volumes of the rear gas springs 8, 9 to allow flow of hydraulic fluid between the rear gas springs 8, 9 . The fluid may flow freely or through an orifice and relief valve assembly 16 .
