SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide organic phosphoric acid ester derivatives which have excellent fungicidal, insecticidal, miticidal activities. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the organic phosphoric acid ester derivatives. Still a further object of the present invention is to provide an effective fungicidal, insecticidal or miticidal composition.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Various organic phosphorus compounds have been synthesized and intensive physiological tests have been performed as a result of which it has been found that the compounds of the formula I exhibit a high ability to control various fungi, insect pests, mites and unhygienic insects harmful to agricultural and horticultural crops.

As the above list indicates the compounds of the present invention are effective against quite a wide variety of insects, mites, etc. Because of this broad insecticidal activity, various vest insects can simultaneously be controlled with each crop treatment, thus reducing the overall costs of protecting the crop. For instance, apple leaf miner, leaf rollers, peach fruit moth, and oriental moth Cnidocampa flavescens on apple trees tobacco cutworm, cabbage armyworm, diamondback moth, cucurbit leaf beetle Aulacophora femoralis , aphids, and Tetranychidae on vegetables or leaf rollers, tea leaf miner CGracilaria theivora , Tetranychus kanzawai , and white peach scale Pseudaulacapsis pentagona on tea plants can be controlled at one time. The compounds of this invention exhibit especially superior effects against rice water weevil which has recently bred in paddy fields and which has been a problem to control for some commercially available chemicals. In general, it is comparatively diffucult to control those insect pests which have many number of generation or long breeding seasons and those insect pests which are parasitic to crops. Generally, this means application of chemicals must be performed many times and in the case of crops this must be done without damaging the crop or making the crop unfit for consumption. The compounds of this invention have extremely long lasting effects, parti cularly against rice stem borer and rice water weevil, they are quite effective at controlling these insect pests with a minimum of applications.Furthermore, because the compounds of this invention are not phytotoxic to plants and are of low toxicity to mammals, they can safely be applied to agricultural and horticultural crops such as rice vegetables, e.g., cabbage, raddish, Chinese cabbage, egg plant, green pepper, tomato, cucumber beans, e.g., soybeans, kidney beans, adzuki beans, peas tea leaves cotton plant fruit trees, e.g., apple, citrus fruits, pears, kaki CJapanese persimmon , peach, grapes beet potato, sweet potato, taro and the like. The compounds of this invention are also effective for controlling various fungi, e.g., Piricularia oryzae,Pellicularia sasaki, etc. They are especially effective against Piricularia oryzae. Some specific examples of the compounds of this invention are illustrated in Table 1 below but as a matter of course this invention is not to be construed as being limited to these compounds alone.
