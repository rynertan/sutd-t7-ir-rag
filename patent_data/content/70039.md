# POLYMERIZATION CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING ALPHA OLEFINS

## Abstract
Alpha olefins are polymerized employing a catalyst which forms on mixing a catalyst component A formed by milling together a magnesium halide or manganous halide with selected catalyst adjuvants followed by treatment of the resulting milled product with a halogenated tetravalent titanium compound and combining the product thus formed with a cocatalyst component B comprising at least one of an organoaluminum compound and an organoaluminum monohalide with or without an aromatic ester as a part of the cocatalyst system.
