## Description
Pharmacological agents possessing the ability to block cellular tranamembrane influx of calcium are capable of suppressing that portion of myocardial or smooth muscle contractility which is dependent upon extracellular calcium. These pharmacological agents, termed calcium antagonists, have been proven to be useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, cardiac myopathy and coronary artery vasospasm a possible cause of sudden cardiac death syndrome .Can 3. Physiol. Pharmacol., 57 443 1979 Drugs, 15 169 1978 Acta Pharmacol. Toxicol., 43, suppl. 1, 45 1978 . In theory, calcium antagonists are thought to act by blocking calcium influx through discrete calcium channels slow channels in cell membranes. Various tissues exhibit relative differences in sensivity toward the calcium blocking effect achieved by certain calcium antagonists, theoretically as a result of tissue specific differences in the calcium channels. ActaPharmacol. Toxicol., 43, 5, 1978 loc. cit. 291 1978 Microvascular Res., 6, 73 1973 Am Rev. Pharmacol.Toxicol., 17 149 1977 . Calcium channels of tissue which are most sensitive to calcium antagonist blockade are those which allow calcium influx only when the cell membranes are electrically depolarised. a adrenergic receptoractivated calcium channels are relatively unaffected by these agents. Circ. Res., 46 426 1980 . This observation provides basis for revaluation of calcium antagonism. Thus, vascular smooth muscle tissue from the rabbit aorta can be made to contract when exposed to a depolarising solution containing an elevated postassium ion concentration and normal amounts of calcium ions. Calcium antagonists added to the solution produce a dose dependent relaxation of the contracted rabbit aortic tissue. Normal contraction of the aortic tissue can then be induced in the presence of a calcium antagonist by subsequent addition of an a adrenergic agonist, such as norepinephrine, to the solution. Eur. J. Pharmacol., 53, 281 1979 Circ. Res., 46 426 1980 3.Exp. Pharmacol. Therap., 174 500 1970 .The normal contraction produced by an a adrenergic agonist after maximal smooth muscle relaxation has been induced by a calcium antagonist, serves to distinguish the calcium blocking effect of an agent from a nonspecific depressant effect on the muscle. In accordance with this invention there is provided a group of 1,4,5,6,7,8 hexahydro 2 alkyl 4 aryl 5 oxo 1,7 naphthyridine 3 carboxylic acid esters and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which compounds are calcium antagonists useful in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, cardiac myopathy and coronary artery vasospasm. More specifically, the compounds of this invention are those of the formula EMI2.1 in which R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or benzyl R2 is alkyl of I to 6 carbon atoms R 3 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxyalkyl in which each alkyl moiety has 1 to 6 carbon atoms,EMI2.2 where R9 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R10 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or arylalkyl of 7 to 10 carbon atoms and R9 and R10 taken with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, 4 alkylpiperazinyl in which the alkyl group contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or morpholinyl heterocycle and n is one of the integers 0, 1 or 2 R1 is pentafluorophenyl, tetrafluorophenyl orEMI3.1 wherein R6 and R8 are, independently, hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halo, trifluoromethyl, alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkylthio of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, cyano or nitro 7 R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halo, trifluoromethyl, cyano or nitro and R6 and R7 when in ortho position to each other and taken together are butadienylene, tetramethylene or trimethylene or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compounds that are preferred because of production economics and availability of starting materials are those in which the aliphatic moieties are straight or branched chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the arylalkyl group representing R10 is benzyl or phenethyl and n is 1 or 2. The compounds of this invention may be prepared by reacting a 3 oxo 5 hydroxy 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine derivative piperidine 3,5 dione , an aldehyde and a substituted or unsubstituted 3 aminocrotonate ester according to the reaction schemeEMI4.1 where R12 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or benzyl. The terms unsubstituted and substituted as used herein in respect of the 3 aminocrotonate esters denote that R2 is is alkyl of 1 carbon atom and alkyl of 2 to 6 carbon atoms respectively. The benzyl group of the compound of formula VII or a salt thereof may be removed by hydrogenolysis to afford the 7 unsubstituted products. If desired, the substituted or unsubstituted 3 aminocrotonate esters may be prepared, in situ, by ammonolysis of the alkanoylacetic acid having the formula R2COCH2CO2R3. The compounds of this invention may also be prepared by reaction of a benzylidine alkanoylacetic acid ester of the formula EMI4.2 with a 3 oxo 5 hydroxy 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine of the formula EMI4.3 in the presence of ammonia. The ammonia may be supplied to the reaction medium as gaseous ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or an ammonium salt of a weak organic acid such as ammonium acetate. The benzylidene alkanoylacetic acid ester ractant may be prepared by reaction of an aldehyde having the formula R1CHO with an alkanoylacetic acid ester of the formula R2C0C142C02R3 The 3 oxo 5 hydroxy 1,2s3,6 tetrahydropyridines having formula IV may be prepared from N substituted glycine esters by standard procedures.The N methyl andN benzyl 3 oxo 5 hydroxy 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridines are literature compounds Archiv. d er Pharmazie, 300 91 1967 J.A.C.S. 95 7458 1973 Tet. Lett., 4075 1977 . The preparatory technique generally follows the equations EMI5.1 The aldehyde and substituted or unsubstituted 3 aminocrotonate reactants are either commercially available or may be prepared by standard procedures. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the antihypertensive agents of this invention may be prepared directly by neutralisation of the free base or by metathetical displacement. The physiologically acceptable salts may be formed with organic or inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, sulphonic, nitric , methylsulphonic, acetic, maleic, succinic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, salicylic, lactic, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, and the like. The free bases may be prepared by neutralizing the acid addition salts by treatment with a base. The N benzyl 1,4,5,6,7,8 hexahydro 2 alkyl 4 aryl 5 oxo 1,7 naphthyridine 3 carboxylic acid esters form an additional intermediate compound aspect of the invention useful in the preparation of the N unsubstituted analogues referred to supra. The N benzyl intermediates are depicted by the structural formula EMI6.1 where PhCH2 is benzyl and the R1 R3 groups are defined supra. These compounds, although categorised as intermediates herein, are very potent in vitro Ca 2 antagonists. TheN benzyl derivatives generally lack sufficient bioavailability in vivo because of their insolubility, protein binding propensity or analogous functional deactivating property to qualify as meaningful antihypertensive agents.Derivitisation of the 7 benzyl intermediates to afford in vivo antihypertensive activity is achieved by preparing compounds that are functionalised to provide solubility and avoid physical deactivation in the animal. Thus, preparation of the aminoalkyl esters where R3 has formula II illustrates one method for improving the bioavailability of the 7 benzyl derivatives such that they afford excellent antihypertensive agents without removal of the 7 benzyl substituent. The in vitro Ca 2 antagonist level and the in vivo blood pressure reduction obtained, where applicable, for these intermediates, is presented in the following examples. The compounds of this invention were initially shown to exhibit Ca 2 antagonism in rabbit aortic strips wherein the strips were contracted in an organ bath containing a modified physiological salt solution Broekaert et al.,Europ. J. Pharmacol. 53 281 1979 in which 100 millimoles potassium ion had been substituted on an equimolar basis for sodium ion. After a stable active tension has developed in the strip, as measured by Statham UC 2 force transducers and rscorded on an eight channelBeckman Dynograph Polygraphic Recorder, an amount of the antagonist was added to the organ bath to make a 10 molar concentration of antagonist. The depressant effect, expressed as percent relaxtion, was taken from the mean of at least two experiments.After maximum Ca 2 antagonist induced relaxation was obtained, a maximal dose of norepinephrine 10 5 moles was added to the organ bath to determine whether normal a adrenergic responses were still effected and show that the compound being tested was not a general depressant. A Ca 2 antagonist producing a 20 per cent relaxation of aortic tissue in this test procedure at a 1D 5 molar bath concentration of the antagonist, generally produces a significant reduction blood pressure when a sufficient amount is given to the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The in vivo blood pressure lowering ability of the compounds of this invention was established by measuring the systolic pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats with a Decker Caudal Plethysmograph or similar sensor device.The compound tEing tested is administered to groups of four rats and their blood pressure is read prior to compound administration and at 1.5 and 4 hours after compound administration. Depending upon the behaviour of the compound being tested, the schedule of blood pressure readings and route of administration is modified.Initially the compounds are administered orally but where compound solubility is a factor, the compounds may be administered parenterally i.e. i.p., i.m., s.c., i.v., etc. as desired. The compounds of this invention were initially administered orally at a standard testing dose of 50 mg kg. Based upon the activity profile elicited by the compounds of this invention in the above described standard scientifically recognised test models, the compounds are established as hypotensive agents useful in the treatment of hypertension and conditions characterised by constrictive blood flow in coronary arteries. For that purpose, the compounds may be administered orally or parenterally in suitable dosage forms compatable with the route of administration, whether oral, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal, buccal, etc. The effective dose range determined in the animal test models has been established at from 1 to about 50 milligrams per kilogram host body weight to be administered in single or plural doses as needed to obtain the desired hypotensive response.The specific dosage regimen for a given patient will depend upon age, pathological state, severity of dysfunction, size of the patient, etc. Oral administration is performed with either a liquid or solid dosage unit in any conventional form such as tablets, capsules, solutions, etc., which comprise a unit dose e.g. from about 25 milligrams to about 4 grams of the active ingredient alone or in combination with adjuvants needed for conventional coating, tableting, solubilising, flavour or colouring. Parenteral administration with liquid unit dosage forms may be via sterile solutions or suspensions in aqueous or oleagenous medium. Isotonic aqueous vehicle for injection is preferred with or without stabilisers, preservatives and emulsifiers. Thus the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound having formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may be prepared by bringing the compound having formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof into association with the said carrier, for example, by mixing the ingredients. The following examples illustrate the preparation of a representative number of compounds of this invention.After each example, the Caf antagonist activity of the compound is presented in terms of per cent relaxation P.R. at the stated concentration. Similarly, the anti hypertensive activity is reported in terms of millimetres mercury mmHg blood pressure B.P. reduction at the stated time post 50 mg kg oral dosing unless otherwise indicated.
