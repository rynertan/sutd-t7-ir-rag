Carswell et al. found that the serum of mice infected with bacillus Calmette Guerin BCG and then treated with an endotoxin contains a substance which necrotizes transplanted Meth A sarcoma and named it a tumor necrosis factor TNF Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA, TNF is considered to be a physiologically active substance released from macrophages, and is known to be characterized in that i when it is administered to animals bearing a certain kind of tumor for example, Meth A sarcoma , it induces necrosis of the tumor and cures the animals ii it has a cytotoxic effect Because of these characteristics, it has been strongly desired to develop TNF as a new type of antitumor agent. TNF or a TNF like substance has been reported in the following literature references or published in the following documents. The processes disclosed in these documents are characterized by involving purification of TNF from body fluids e.g., blood or tissues of rabbits, mice, hamsters or guinea pigs as raw materials. The products, however, are not so clearly defined, and it is evident that various restrictions are imposed on these processes in regard to the supply of raw materials and the purities of the final products.

The partially modified DNAs mentioned above mean DNAs having a base sequence corresponding to formula I or II in which one or more codons are deleted, and or one or more codons are substituted by one or more other codons. Processes for the preparation of the DNA of this invention and the polypeptide will be The DNA of this invention encoding rabbit TNF or a principal portion thereof coding for a rabbit TNF polypeptide with equivalent biological activities can be produced by cultivating rabbit macrophages together with inducers, separating a fraction containing rabbit TNF mRNA from the macrophages, preparing a cDNA library from the fraction, and cloning the rabbit TNF cDNA by using a differential hybridization method followed by mRNA hybridization translation assay. Furthermore, according to this invention, it is possible to cultivate in a suitable culture medium a host transformed with an expression vector containing DNA derived from the rabbit TNT cDNA, whereby a polypeptide having or containing rabbit TNF or a principal Portion thereof coding for a rabbit TNF polypeptide with equivalent biological activities from the host cells or the culture medium can be obtained. As stated above, the DNA having or containing the DNA encoding the rabbit TNT or a principal portion thereof coding for a rabbit TNF polypeptide with equivalent biological activities can be modified by techniques known In the above DNA or its modified DNA of this invention, one or more codons can be substituted by a corresponding degenerated codon or codons.

Now, the process for producing the DNA of this invention and the process for producing the polypeptide of will be described in detail. It should be I 1. Preparation of rabbit TNF mRNA According to this invention, the rabbit TNT mRNA can be obtained, for example, by the following method. Rabbits are intravenously or intraperitoneally injected with an activator of the reticuloendothelial system, such as After the cultivation, total RNA is extracted from the cells by a customary method, for example the method of Chirgwin et al. Biochemistry, To confirm that the resulting mRNA fraction is the desired one containing mRNA encoding rabbit TNF, the mRNA is made to translate into a protein and its biological activity is examined. This can be carried out, for example, by injecting the mRNA into the oocytes of I 2. Cloning of rabbit TNF cDNA The mRNA fraction obtained in step I 1 above is used as a template, and an oligo dT or a pool of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides having base sequences corresponding to a part of amino acid sequence of rabbit plasma TNF see Referential Example 2 below is used as a primer. A sscDNA complementary to the mRNA is synthesized by using reverse transcriptase for example, that derived from avian myeloblastosis virus AMV in the presence of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP. By alkali treatment, the template mRNA is hydrolyzed and removed. Then, the sscDNA is used as a template, and a dscDNA is synthesized by using reverse tanscriptase or The resulting dscDNA is inserted, for example, into the restriction endonuclease The cDNA library is subjected to a colony hybridization assay D. Hanahan et al., Gene, ³²P labelled cDNA is sythesized using the enriched mRNA fraction with the rabbit TNF mRNA obtained in step I 1 as a template and used as an induction plus probe. Separately, a mRNA fraction, obtained by the same procedure as above except that non induced alveolar macrophages from normal rabbits are used as a starting material, is used as a template and ³²P labelled cDNA is synthesized. The ³²P labelled cDNA is used as an induction minus probe. From the above cDNA library, plasmid clones which are strongly hybridized with the induction plus probe but not hybridized with the induction minus probe are selected. The following method is carried out in order to confirm that the resulting clones harbor a cDNA insert encoding rabbit TNF. The plasmid DNAs are isolated from the above clones, converted to a single stranded DNA by heating or alkali treatment, and fixed to a nitrocellulose filter. The mRNA fraction containing rabbit TNF mRNA is added to the filter to hybridize it. Then, the hybridized mRNA is eluted and recovered. The recovered mRNA is injected into the oocytes of The above method gives clones of transformants containing the cloned plasmids having inserted thereinto a DNA fragment containing a base sequence complementary to the rabbit TNF mRNA. When the cloned cDNAs do not contain the whole coding region of the rabbit TNF, cDNAs of a larger size are selected by screening the cDNA library using a cloned TNF cDNA fragment of the transformants cleaved with a suitable restriction endonuclease and labelled with ³²P as a probe. A cloned cDNA having a base sequence encoding a polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of rabbit TNF can be obtained finally by analyzing the base sequences of some of the resulting cloned cDNA fragments in accordance with, for example, the Maxam Gilbert method Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA, The cloned cDNAs, by the determination of their base sequences to be described hereinbelow, have been found to include DNA having the base sequence of formula II and DNA having a base sequence corresponding to formula II in which AGT, the 87th codon from the 5 terminal, is substituted by GGT. Our investigations have shown that the cDNA encoding the polypeptide of rabbit TNF has the base sequence of formula I above or a base sequence corresponding to formula I in which AGT, the 7th codon from the 5 terminal, is substituted by GGT. The resulting cloned DNAs may be used as such, but as required, they may be modified to DNAs having or containing a base sequence corresponding to formula I or II in which A one or more codons are deleted, and or B one or more codons are substituted by one or more other codons as long as they are coding for a rabbit TNF polypeptide with equivalent biological activities In the above cloned cDNA or the modified cDNAs thereof, one or more codons may be substituted by a degenerated codon or codons. II Production of rabbit TNF polypeptide A detailed description will follow of the process for producing the polypeptide having or containing rabbit TNT or a principal portion thereof coding for a rabbit TNF polypeptide with equivalent biological activities by using the cloned DNA of this invention. An expression vector for production of rabbit TNF can be obtained by inserting the cloned DNA of the invention into a suitable vector. All vectors which proliferate in microorganisms to be transformed can be used. Examples include plasmids More specifically, an expression vector for production of the non fused polypeptide is constructed by joining a DNA fragment containing the base sequence of formula I encoding the amino acid sequence of formula A , in which the initiation codon ATG is added to the 5 terminal and the termination codon TAA, TAG or TGA exists at the 3 terminal, to a DNA fragment with a suitable promoter and the Shine Dalgarno sequence and inserting it into a vector. An expression vector for the production of the fused polypeptide may be constructed by inserting the cDNA fragment having the base sequence of formula I into the vector so that the translational reading frame coincides with that of the structure genes to be fused. Examples of the promoters are Transformants are obtained by introducing the expression vector into a host such as microorganism, animal or plant cells. For example, The resulting transformants are cultivated under suitable conditions for the transformants until the polypeptide A desired is fully produced. Then, the polypeptide A is extracted from the culture. When the produced polypeptide A is accumulated in the cytoplasm, the host cells are destroyed by lysozyme digestion and freezing and thawing or sonication or by using a French press, and then centrifuged or filtered to collect the extract. When it is accumulated in the periplasm, it can be extracted, for example, by the method of Willsky et al. J. Bacteriol., The crude polypeptide A so obtained can be purified by general purifying methods for proteins, for example by combinations of ultrafiltration, dialysis, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, etc. Polypeptides other than the polypeptide A , having equivalent biological activities to rabbit TNF polypeptide A and a polypeptide with methionine at the N terminal of the polypeptide A can be produced substantially in accordance with the above process, or by using proper combinations of known processes. For formulating the polypeptides, The polypeptides are useful as antitumor agents because they have a selective cytotoxic effect on tumor cells and heal tumors of tumor bearing animals. Such polypeptide preparations are preferably administered parenterally or topically. Parenteral routes such as intraveous and intramuscular routes are used when tumor cells extend over a wide range or metastasize, or when prevention of metastasis is intended. Against local tumor tissues, direct intratumor administration is preferred. The dosage varies depending upon the type and size of tumors, the condition of the patient and the route of administration. Usually, it is 5 x 10² to 5 x 10⁷ units kg, preferably 5 x 10³ to 5 x 10⁶ units kg see Referential Example 2 given hereinafter in respect of units . For simplification of the description, the following abbreviations are used in the present specification and claims. The following Examples and Referential Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. It should be understood however that the invention is in no way limited to these examples. For a better understanding of the following examples, Figures 1 to 4 are attached to the present specification. Figure 1 is fractionation pattern of a rabbit TNF mRNA by acid urea agarose gel electrophoresis Example 1, 1 Figure 2 shows the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites and sizes of DNA fragments used in determining the base sequence of cloned cDNA plasmid pRTNF802 encoding rabbit TNF Example 1, 8 Figure 3 shows a process of constructing an expression vector pRTT22 Example 2 and Figure 4 shows a process for constructing an experession vector pRTTG Example 3 . The number of amino acid residues which are deduced from the base sequence 277th to 738th encoding the rabbit TNF polypeptide is 154, and its amino acid composition and calculated molecular weight are shown in Table 2 below. The amino acid composition and molecular weight agreed within the range of experimental errors with the amino acid composition of the rabbit plasma TNF and its measured molecular weight shown in Referential Example 2. Production of rabbit TNF polypeptide A DNA fragment having a size of 513 bp was cut out from the cloned cDNA see Table 1 encoding rabbit TNF obtained in Example 1 by using restriction endonucleases Twenty micrograms of the RTNF DNA fragment was incubated at 37 C for 35 minutes in 0.4 ml of 10mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 buffer containing 50mM The The above The above procedure gave a DNA fragment containing the Six micrograms of the Separately, from plasmid pBR322 4362 bp a 3741 bp DNA fragment containing an ampicillin resistance gene to be referred to as the The The resulting recombinant plasmid pRTT22 was introduced into The recombinant plasmid pRTT22 was mixed with the calcium treated The transformants JM103 pRTT22 were cultivated overnight in the LB broth containing 25 micrograms ml of ampicillin. The culture was inoculated in 10 times its volume of the modified M9 medium composition 0.7 The TNF activity L 929 cell cytotoxic activity of the extract was 2.4 x 10³ units ml. This cytotoxic activity was completely neutralized with an antibody to rabbit plasma TNF shown in Referential Example 3. In the 98 positive colonies selected by second screening of the cDNA library by colony hybridization assay as shown in Example 1, 7 , there were 17 clones harboring recombinant plasmids containing TNF cDNA inserts having a size of at least 1 kbp. The individual cDNA inserts were cut out from these 17 clones using restriction endonuclease With regard to a plasmid having another type of cDNA inserted thereinto named pRTNF865 , the base sequence of the coding region for rabbit TNF was determined by the method of Maxam Gilbert in the same way as shown in Example 1, 8 . It was consequently found that from the 285th base to the 741st base, only one base, i.e. A in the 295th position, was substituted by G in the base sequence shown in Table 1. Accordingly, the above cDNA is considered to be an allelic mutant of the cDNA obtained in Example 1. Then, a fragment of the cDNA inserted into plasmid pRTNF865, namely a DNA fragment corresponding to the 285th base to the 583rd base in Table 1 except that the 295th base is G, was cut out by using restriction endonuclease By the same method as shown in Example 2, this expression vector was introduced into The foregoing experimental fact shows that a polypeptide was produced in which only one amino acid was different from the TNF polypeptide shown in Example 1, namely the seventh amino acid from the N terminal excluding Met derived from the initiation codon ATG i.e. Ser, was replaced by Gly, and that this polypeptide had cytotoxic activity. Isolation and purification of rabbit plasma TNF Rabbits body weight 2.5 to 3.0 kg were injected intravenously with 50 mg of killed dried cells of EDTA 24 g and 240 g of celite were added to 24 liters of the plasma, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then filtered successively through filters having a pore size of 3 microns, 1 micron and 0.2 micron. To 24 liters of the filtrate was added 12 liters of 0.04M Tris HCl pH 7.8 buffer, and the mixture was applied onto a column 27 x 45 cm of DEAE Sepharose The active fraction was heated at 60 C for 30 minutes and rapidly cooled to 4 C. The cooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The resulting concentrate was applied onto a column 5 x 80 cm of Sephacryl The concentrate of the active fraction obtained by gel filtration was applied onto a column of Zn The active fractions obtained in the previous step were concentrated and applied onto a column 1.5 x 90 cm of Toyopearl HW 55 a product of Toyo Soda Co., Ltd. fully equilibrated with 0.005M phosphate pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.15M Properties of the rabbit plasma TNF The cytotoxic activity against mouse L 929 cells and the antitumor activity against Meth A sarcoma transplanted into mice were evaluated on the purified rabbit plasma TNF isolated in Referential Example 1. The method of measuring the cytotoxic activity on L 929 cells was as follows A TNF sample 0.1 ml diluted serially in a medium and 0.1 ml of a suspension of L 929 cells 5 x 10⁵ ml containing actinomycin D 2 micrograms ml were added into each well using a 96 well microtiter plate Flow Laboratories . The Eagle minimum essential medium containing 1 v v of fetal bovine serum was used. The plate was incubated at 37 C for 18 hours in air containing 5 of carbon dioxide. After the incubation, 20 microliters of glutaraldehyde was added to fix the viable cells. After fixation, the microplate was washed and dried. Then, 0.1 ml of 0.05 methylene blue solution was added to dye the fixed cells. The excess of methylene blue was washed off, and the plate was dried. Methylene blue associated with the fixed cells was eluted with 0.36N HCl and its absorbance at 665 nm was measured by a Titertek Multiscan Flow Laboratories . The absorbance is proportional to the number of viable cells. The amount of biological activity required to kill 50 of the L 929 cells was defined as one unit ml, and the dilution ratio of the sample corresponding to a 50 value of the absorbance of a control to which the sample was not added was determined from a graph or by calculation. The reciprocal of the dilution ratio is defined as the biological activity units ml in the sample. The cytotoxic activity against L 929 cells of 1 mg of the purified rabbit plasma TNF was about 3 x 10⁷ units. The antitumor effect on mice bearing Meth A sarcoma was evaluated by the following method. Into the abdominal skin of BALB c mice were subcutaneously transplanted 2 x 10⁵ Meth A cells, and seven days later, mice were selected in which a tumor, 6 7 mm in diameter, was formed. Into the tumor mass 3 x 10⁴ units of the purified rabbit plasma TNF was injected. Within 24 hours after the injection, a necrotic response was observed in the tumor transplant, and the tumor was completely cured within 14 days. The molecular weight of the purified rabbit plasma TNF was measured by gel filtration analysis in accordance with high performance liquid chromatography in the presence and absence of 8M urea. As a result, TNF derived from the rabbit plasma had a molecular weight of about 45,000 daltons in the absence of urea. In the presence of urea, it was dissociated into a single polypeptide which was found to have a molecular weight of about 16,000 daltons. The molecular weight in the presence of urea, namely in the completely dissociated state, is considered to be the molecular weight of the monomer of the rabbit TNF. The amino acid composition of the rabbit plasma TNF was determined by a micro amino acid analyzer made by Shimadzu Seisakusho in accordance with a fluorometric method using orthophthalaldehyde after the sample was hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid. The results are tabulated in Table 3. The partial amino acid sequence including the N terminal and C terminal were analyzed by the Edman degradation method, the hydrazine degradation method, and the enzymatic method using carboxypeptidase. It was consequently found that the amino acid sequences at the N terminal and C terminal portions were as follows Preparation of an anti rabbit plasma TNF antibody TNF solution containing 1 x 10⁶ units of the purified rabbit plasma TNF obtained in Referential Example 1 was emulsified with an equal volume of the Freund s complete adjuvant, and the emulsion was injected subcutaneously into the back of guinea pigs at several parts. Then, the animals were immunized by the same method 1, 3 and 6 weeks later. Furthermore, 8 weeks later, the same amount of the purified rabbit plasma TNF was intraperitoneally injected together with aluminum hydroxide gel. The whole blood was taken by cardiac puncture 9 weeks after the first immunization, and centrifuged to obtain an antiserum containing an anti rabbit plasma TNF antibody. The antiserum was passed through a column of Sepharose An about 60,000 fold dilution of this purified antibody has the ability of neutralizing 50 of 500 units of the cytotoxic activity of the rabbit plasma TNF against L 929 cells.
