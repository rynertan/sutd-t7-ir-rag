# Process for preparing pyrimidine.

## Abstract
Process for preparing pyrimidine by reacting in the gas phase 1,3 diaminopropane with a C‚ÇÅ reagent in the presence of an excess of methanol and or carbon monoxide and of a metallic catalyst, characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst promoted with an alkali metal and subsequently from the resulting reaction mixture pyrimidine is recovered.
