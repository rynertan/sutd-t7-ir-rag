# Thermal printer.

## Abstract
The present invention is equipped with a plurality of print buffers 27, 28 for inputting print data into a thermal head 10 , wherein such print data are selectively fed to simply change the current on time for energizing the heating elements 35 of the thermal head relative to specific information 17 out of the entire information to be printed, so that the specific information 17 is printed emphatically in a particular colour to become consipicuous, and simul taneously the contour of each specific character is edged in a basic colour to be distinctly legible. Such edged print is attained by utilizing the gradient of the temperature distribu tion induced in the heating elements by the current on time control system, hence eliminating the necessity of any edging print data to consequently simplify the control.
