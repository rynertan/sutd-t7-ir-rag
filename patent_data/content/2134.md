# Process for making planar diodes with low cost silicon substrates and solar cells produced therefrom.

## Abstract
Epitaxial and diffusion type planar diodes and solar cells utilize low cost refined metallurgical silicon substrates having a substantially higher impurity content than conventional high cost, high purity semiconductor grade silicon. The epitaxial type products have an n on p on p substrate configuration, while the diffusion type products have pentavalent impurities diffused therein to form a p n junction in the low cost silicon substrate. One embodiment employs a multigrained refined metallurgical silicon RMS prepared by precipitating essentially iron free silicon platelets from a solution of metallurgical grade silicon in molten aluminium, melting said refined platelets in contact with a silica slag and pulling silicon boules from a melt of said refined metallurgical silicon RMS . By directionally solidifying the refined silicon slag melt, a multigrained, directionally solidified refined metallurgical silicon DS RMS is obtained, with boules being pulled from a melt thereof for use as said low cost substrate. The DS RMS may also be re melted and directionally solidified a second time with the boules being pulled from said twice directionally solidified material being a desirable low cost, single crystal material suitable for use as said substrate for planar diode and solar cell applications.
