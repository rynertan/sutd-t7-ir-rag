# Wire accumulator.

## Abstract
An accumulator wherein the peripheral speeds of sepa rate, accumulating guide roller assemblies are caused by respective independent mechanical arrangements to coin cide with the take up speeds of first and second take up devices. Using this arrangement, the speed of the optical fiber being accumulated is always equal to the peripheral speed of the accumulating guide rollers so that there is no instantaneous tension change that would otherwise result from a backlash of interconnecting gears.
