# Polymerizable liquid composition adapted to produce polymers having outstanding optical and mechanical properties, polymers and articles obtained with said composition.

## Abstract
A polymerizable liquid composition is disclosed, intended for preparing polymerizates having outstanding optical and physical properties, said composition consisting of a bis allyl carbonate of a dihydric alcohol oligomer, a bis allylcarbonate monomer of a dihydric or a trihydric alcohol, or an allyl ester, or a triallyl cyanurate or isocyanurate and an acrylic or vinylic monomer, said composition being polymerized in bulk with the aid of at least on a radicalic initiator. Highly transparent articles are obtained, which are very useful for fine optical applications.
