# A METHOD OF CONTOURING A GEOLOGICAL SURFACE USING SEISMIC TECHNIQUES

## Abstract
The invention concerns a method of contouring com prising defining an area above that which it is desired to survey, laying out the detectors at traces placed along op posite portions of the periphery of the area, and then operat ing the wave source at sequential shot points along the re maining portions of the periphery.
