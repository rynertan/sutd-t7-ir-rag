## Description
P.82.080 BT Fastener and Seal Combination This invention relates to a fastener such as a screw or bolt of the type having a threaded shank and an enlarged diameter head for engagement by a driving tool. The invention is particularly applicable to a screw or bolt used for securing cladding to a rigid support such as for example in the securing of roof cladding to a purlin. One of the problems in securing cladding to a rigid support is that a good weather tight seal must be provided and maintained between the head of the fastener and the outer face of the cladding material and it is an object of the present invention to provide a fastener and seal combination which is effective in use yet simple and economic to produce. In accordance with the invention there is provided a fastener and seal combination wherein the fastener comprises a threaded shank and an enlarged head providing a recess on its under surface, and the seal comprises a metal washer having an elastomeric washer bonded thereto with the metal washer of the seal being shaped to fit within said recess in the fastener head with the elastomeric washer protruding from said recess. Conveniently the recess in the fastener head is circular and the metal washer of the seal may be of flat annular form. Alternatively the metal washer of the seal may be of domed annular form, the convex surface of which fits within said recess. The elastomeric washer is conveniently of flat annular form and is of a diameter less than the diameter of the metal washer. The fastener of the fastener and seal combination conveniently comprises a self tapping screw with self tapping threads on the shank thereof. Furthermore the screw may be provided with a drill point at its leading end.Alternatively the fastener may comprise a wood screw. Other features of the invention will become apparent from the following description given herein solely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a side cross sectional view of a fastener and seal combination in accordance with the invention wherein the fastener comprises a self tapping screw shown securing a thin metal sheet to a steel purlin and Figure 2 is a similar side cross sectional view to that of Figure 1 showing the fastener tightened down on to the sheet material. In the drawings the fastener of the fastener and seal combination of the invention is shown as comprising a self tapping screw used for the connection of thin sheet material 10 to a rigid support 12 such as a steel purlin. The outer sheet material 10 may be aluminium or steel Although the fastener is illustrated as being a self tapping screw it will be appreciated that the fastener may be a self drilling self tapping screw such as for example of the type having a drill point formed thereon at its leading end whereby the fastener may drill its own hole through the sheet material and through the purlin. The fastener has a threaded shank 14 and an enlarged head 16 comprising a plastics moulding which is moulded in situ around a staked upper end 18 of the fastener shank.The enlarged plastics head is provided around its periphery with axially extending grooves for enabling it to be engaged by a suitable chuck of a power driving tool and is provided on its under surface with a circular recess 20 bounded by a peripheral lip 22. As is best seen from Figure 1, the seal comprises a metal washer 24 and an elastomeric washer 26 bonded thereto.In this construction both the metal washer 24 and the elastomeric washer 26 are of flat annular form with the diameter of the elastomeric washer being somewhat less than the diameter of the metal washer. The metal washer 24 is shaped to be a snug fit within the circular recess 20 in the plastics head of the fastener. The axial dimension of the elastomeric washer is somewhat greater than that of the metal washer. The metal washer 24 is formed of steel and the elastomeric washer 26 is formed of a synthetic rubber. Figure 2 of the drawings shows the fastener tightened down upon the outer sheet material 10 thus causing the material of the elastomeric washer 26 to be extruded radially beyond the confines of the plastics head 16 to provide a seal with the outer face of the sheet material 10.The fact that the elastomeric washer is bonded to the metal washer, and the metal washer is restrained within the recess in the plastics head, ensures an even distribution of the elastomeric material during the tightening down operation. As stated hereinbefore, the metal washer 24 may be flat as illustrated, or may be dome shaped with its convex outer surface directed towards the recess 20 in the fastener head.In either construction, the metal washer 24 and the fastener head 16 may be arranged relative to one another such that the metal washer 24, with its bonded washer 26, is either rotatable with, or stationary relative to, the head 16 when the fastener is tightened down. Any subsequent relative movement of the outer sheet material relative to the fastener, such as may be occasioned by expansion and contraction of the sheet material, will not disturb the seal afforded by the elastomeric washer 26 which will be retained in its position due to its being bonded to the metal washer 24 as aforesaid.
