# Fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A single plunger distributor type fuel injection pump 18 for a multi cylinder internal combustion engine having improved features for preventing cavitation in the fuel dis tribution passages 164 upon fuel cutoff and for providing a uniform residual fuel pressure in the idle fuel distribution passages. The pump does not have the usual delivery valve for maintaining a high residual fuel pressure in the distribu tion passages. Instead, the passages, upon injection termina tion, drain into a spill chamber 178 , the pressure within which builds up to resist fuel flow from the passages and minimize cavitation therein. The spill chamber pressure is relieved by a bleed passage 106 opening into the low pres sure fuel supply chamber 102 . The pressure in the idle fuel distribution passages is maintained at a low predetermined level by connection of these passages to the fuel supply chamber between injection intervals.
