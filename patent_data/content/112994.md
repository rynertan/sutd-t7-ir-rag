# VAPOR PROOF HOUSING ASSEMBLY AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
A sealed vapor proof housing assembly for isolating an electrical device 14 from the ambient atmosphere compris ing a casing 12 having a removable door 16 to provide access to the interior of the casing 12 , a first multiple number of heat exchange fins 38 projecting from the casing 12 into the atmosphere, a second multiple number of heat exchange fins 40 projecting from the casing 12 within the interior thereof for transferring heat from the interior to the ambient atmosphere, a sleeve liner 42 disposed within the casing 12 contiguous to the interior fins 40 for forming a compartment with the liner 42 having open ends spaced from the door 16 and rear end of the casing 12 . A fan 30 is mounted on the liner 42 for circulating air in a closed circulating pattern in intimate contact with the interior fins 40 . Air is pumped into the casing through a one way valve 62 and a pressure switch 64 is electrically coupled to the fan 50 and a power source for disabling the fan 50 in response to a leak in the casing 12 .
