# X RAY PHOTOGRAPHING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An X ray photographing system is provided with an irradiation field stop, near an X ray source, for limiting the size of the region exposed to X rays, and a receiving side stop for defining X rays passing through an object to impinge upon a recording medium with an aperture the size of which corres ponds to the size of the irradiation field defined by the irradia tion field stop. An interlocking means the receiving side stop to adjust the size of the aperture defined by the receiving side stop in response to the irradiation field stop.
