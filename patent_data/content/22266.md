## Description
Semiconductor circuit device The present invention relates to a semiconductor circuit device including an insulated gate field effect transistor to perform a static operation. In the field of the semiconductor circuit such as an inverting circuit, a remarkable improvement has been attained in the operating speed, a degree of integration, power consumption, and the like. The semiconductor circuit of this type is categorized into two, a static type semiconductor circuit and a dynamic type one. In the static type semiconductor circuit, an output voltage with a fixed level may be continuously obtained by keeping constant an input signal level under the supply of the power source voltage. On the other hand, in the dynamic type semiconductor circuit, it is difficult to keep the output signal level constant, because of the existence of leak current paths contained in the elements constituting the circuit. In respect of a stability of the operation, the static type semiconductor circuit is advantageous over the dynamic type semiconductor circuit. F or example, a conventional MOS type static inverting circuit has a driving MOS transistor whose drain is connected to a resistive element formed of high resistive material or MOS transistor. To reduce the power consumption of the circuit, it is necessary to increase the resistance of the resistive element. Where a MOS transistor is used to form a high resistive element, the channel length the channel width of the MOS transistor must be made large. An attempt to reduce the channel width encounters a difficulty in its manufacturing technique. For this reason, the channel length must be made longer. This results in an enlarged area occupied by the MOS transistor. There is an attempt to restrict the occupation area of a load resistive element on a chip within a small area. For this purpose, a technique of forming a polysilicon with a high resistivity ofEMI2.1 for example, is developed. In another attempt, the high resistive poly silicon is disposed over the upper portion of a drive transistor, with an intention to minimize the occupation area by the load resistive element.The attempt, however, has failed to reduce the occupation area of the load resistive element to a satisfactory extent. To form the poly silicon layer of the load resistive element at the upper portion of the drive transistor, it is necessary to use a double layer polysilicon technique or a multilayer wiring technique.This results in complexity of the manufacturing process.If the load resistive element is formed to have a high resistance, the power consumption of the semiconductor circuit may be made low. In this case, however, a leak current generated at the junction between the drain and the substrate of a drive transistor may cause the drive transistor to erroneously operate. Conversely, when the load resistive element is formed to have a low resistance, the power consumption is increased, so that it is difficult to integrate the semiconductor circuit with a high density. In making the transistor size small to improve a degree of integration, the channel length or the channel width is set to 1 pm or less. In this case, it has generally been considered that it is difficult to obtain a semiconductor circuit having a stable operation, due to a short channel effect or a narrow channel effect that the threshold voltage is greatly influenced by the channel length or the channel width. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor circuit device with a small power consumption which can be integrated with a high density. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor circuit device comprising an insulated gate field effect transistor which is connected at the gate to an input terminal and at the drain to the output terminal, and a power source means coupled between the source and the substrate of the insulated gate field effect transistor to apply between the source and the substrate a forward voltage smaller than a built in potential difference at the PN junction between the source and the substrate. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of an inverting circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of part of a semiconductor device constituting the inverting circuit shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of a memory cell according to another embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 is a memory cell array including memory cells arranged in a matrix form and having the same construction as that of the memory cell shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of an inverting circuit of another embodiment according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a modification of a memory cell shown inFig. 3 and Fig. 7 shows a memory cell array including memory cells arranged in a matrix form and having the same construction as that of the memory cell shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of an inverting circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention andFig. 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of the semiconductor device of the same embodiment. The inverting circuit has an N channel enhancement type MOS FET 2 whose source is grounded. The gate and drain of the t1OSFET 2, are respectively, connected to an input terminal 4 and an output terminal 6. The substrate is biased forwardly with respect to the source by a DC power source E generating an output voltage Vo, for example, 0.4V which is smaller in an absolute value than a contact potential difference or built in potential Qg at the PN junction between the source and the substrate.In constructing a bistable circuit by using a pair of inverting circuits which have the same construction as the inverting circuit shown in Fig. 1, the absolute value of the threshold voltage VT H of the MOS FET 2 is selected to be smaller than the output voltage Vo of the power source E. This is not essential to the other cases than a case where the inverting circuit is used to constitute a flip flop circuit. As shown in Fig. 2, source and drain regions 10 and 12 are formed in the surface region of a P type silicon substrate 8 with an acceptor impurity concentration of 1015 atoms cm3. The source and drain regions 10 and 12 are N type regions doped with doner type impurity such as arsenic impurity or phosphorus impurity, with a high concentration, in a thermal disffusion or an ion plantation. A conductive gate electrode 14 is formed over the surface of the substrate 8 between the source and drain regions, and parts of the source and drain regions 10 and 12, and a gate insulating layer 16 interposed between the gate electrode and the substrate. The gate insulating layer 16 is an oxide silicon layer with 100 t of thickness, for example.The gate electrode 14 may be made of metal such as aluminum or molybdenum or polysilicon doped with impurity. For reducing a temperature dependancy of the difference between work function of the gate electrode 14 and the substrate 8, it is preferable to form the gate electrode of polysilicon doped with the same type impurity as that of the silicon substrate 8. In a case where a forward voltage smaller in an absolute value than a built in potential diference 9B at the PN junction between the source and the substrate is applied between the source and the substrate, the threshold voltage VTH of the MOS transistor is given as follows EMI5.1 where fS is a surface potential measured with respect to a point within a bulk or a point within the substrate at an instant that a weak inversion layer takes place in the surface area of the silicon substrate 8, Vo is a forward voltage applied between the source and the substrate and is set at 0.4V in this example, Tox is the thickness of the gate insulating layer 16, and sOX is a dielectric constant of the gate insulating layer 16.QD represents an amount of charge of acceptor impurity ionized in a depletion layer under the surface of the substrate 8 and is expressed as follows EMI5.2 where q is a unit charge amount, NA is an acceptor impurity concentration in the P type silicon substrate 8, esi is a dielectric factor of the silicon substrate 8 VFB indicates a flat band voltage and is given by the following equation EMI5.3 where QSS is an amount of charge caused by the surface state or an equivalent surface charge imaginarily existing on the surface of the substrate 8 which has an influence similar to that of the charge actually existing within the insulating layer 16, and fMS is a work function difference between the silicon substrate 8 and the gate electrode 14. For example, about 0.5V is set as a surface potential QS when a weak inversion layer is formed in the surface region of the P type silicon substrate with 1015 atoms cm3 of acceptor impurity concentration, in this embodiment. In this case, the threshold voltageVTH of the MOS transistor is equal to VFB 0.12 volt. For example, when VFB 0.13V, VTH is about 0.25V. Under this condition, the inverting circuit shown in Fig. 1 serves as a static type inverting circuit.That is, when OV is applied to the input terminal 4, no channel is formed between the drain and source because the input voltage is smaller than the threshold voltageVTH. To be more specific, the input voltage is smaller than the flat band voltage, so that an accumulation layer is formed in the surface region of the substrte 8.In this case, no channel is formed between the source region 10 and the drain region 12, so that a channel current IDS which flows through a path between the source region 10 and the drain region 12 is made zero.Since the junction between the source region 10 and the substrate 8 is biased forwardly and the drain region 12 is formed within the surface region of the silicon substrate 8, a leak current IL flows through a PN junction region between the drain region 12 and the substrate 8. The flow of the leak current IL holds the potential of the drain region 12 equal to that of the substrate 8, that is, Vo. In this case, the leak current IL is sufficiently large, compared to the channel current MIDST so that the output terminal connected to the drain region 12 is kept at VO. Assuming that 0.4V of the input voltage is applied to the input terminal 4, a channel is formed between the source region 10 and the drain region 12 because the input voltage is higher than the threshold VTH 0.25V of the MOS transistor 2. In this case, the channel current IDS flowing between the source region and the drain region through the channel is much larger than the leak current 1L flowing through the PN junction between the drain region 12 and the substrate 8.Accordingly, the potential at the drain reion 12 and the potential at the output terminal 6 are equal to the potential of the source 10 and ground potential, respectively. Afterwards, when the input voltage is set to 0 V, the channel between the source region 10 and the drain region 12 disappears. As a result, the potential at the output terminal 6 is held at the potential of the substrate 8 by the leak current IL flowing through the junction between the drain region 12 and the substrate 8, as previously stated.In this case, if a forward bias voltage less than the built in potential difference is isapplied to the PN junction, the forward current flowing through the PN junction is very small, so that the currents flowing between the source and substrate and between the drain and the substrate are negligible. Since a forward bias voltage is applied between the source and the substrate, depletion layers between the source and the substrate and between the drain and the substrate are extremely thin. Therefore, the threshold voltage of the MOS transistor is never greatly influenced by the short channel effect and the narrow channel effect. Fig. 3 shows a static type memory cell 100 with a bistable circuit composed of a pair of PlOS transistors 20 and 22 which each have the same function and construction as those of the MOS transistor 2 shown inFigs. 1 and 2 and may be formed to have the comon substrate. The sources of the MOS transistors 20 and 22 are grounded. The gate and drain of the rioS transistor 20 are coupled with the drain and the gate of the MOS transistor 22, respectively. The memory cell 100 has a pair of MOS transistors 24 and 26 which are respectively connected at the sources to the drains of the MOS transistors 20 and 22, at the drains to first and second bit lines 28 and 30, and at the gate to the word line 32.The substrate of the MOS transistors 20, 22, 24 and 26 are coupled with the positive terminal of the power source E. With this connection, a given forward voltage, e.g. 0.4V, with respect to the source, is applied to the substrate of the i1OS transistors 20 and 22. The MOS transistors 24 and 26 are of the enhancement type, and each have a gate insulating layer of 100 A thickness and a threshold voltage of 0.25V. A voltage of 0V or 1.5V is selectively applied to the bit lines 28 and 30. To the word line 32 is applied a two level signal changing between 0V and 2V. The read and write operations of the memory cell 100 shown in Fig. 3 will be described. When the memory cell 100 stores data 1 , the drain of the MOS transistor 20 is at a high potential level and the drain of the HOS transistor 22 at a low potential level 0V . When it stores data Iroll, the drain of the MOS transistor 22 is at a high potential level and the drain of the MOS transistor 20 is at a low potential level 0V . For writing data 1 into the memory cell 100, the potentials of the bit lines 28 and 30 are respectively set to 1.5V and 0V and the potential of the word line 32 is set to 2V. As a result, the MOS transistors 24 and 26 are rendered conductive and the voltage 1.5V on the bit line 28 is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 22 thereby to render the MOS transistor 22 conductive. The drain voltage of the MOS transistor 22 is kept at 0V, so that the MOS transistor 20 is held in a non conductive state. Then, when the word line potential is set to 0V, the MOS transistors 22 and 20 are held in the conductive and non conductive states, respectively.Further, the drain of the rlos transistor 20, which is in the non coductive state, is held at the potential equal to at least the substrate potential, since a forward voltage is applied between the substrate and the source. In this way, the memory cell 100 stores the data 1 on the basis of the static operation. By setting the potentials on the bit lines 28 and 30 to 0V and 1.5V, and setting the potential on the word line 32 to 2V, the RIOTS transistors 20 and 22 are set in the conductive and non conductive states, respectively. Then, by setting the potential on the word line 32 to 0V, the MOS transistors 20 and 22 are held in the conductive and non conductive states, respectively. In this way, the memory cell 100 stores the data 0 . Assume now that the data 1 is stored in the memory cell 100 and the drain voltages of the MOS transistors 20 and 22 are 0.4V and 0V, respectively. For reading out the data 1 from the memory cell 100, the potential on the word line 32 is changed from 0V to 2V under a condition that the bit lines 28 and 30 are both set to 1.5V. Upon the change of the voltage, the MOS transistors 24 and 26 are conductive. At this time, however, the iOS transistor 22 has been conductive, so that the potential on the bit line 30 is forcibly reduced toward the ground potential. Since the MOS transistor 20 is non conductive, the potential on the bit line 28 is held at 1.5V. In this manner, the data 1 is read out from the memory cell through the bit lines 28 and 30. The above mentioned operation is likewise applicable for reading out the data 0 from the memory cell 100. In this case, by changing the potential on the word line 32 from 0V to 2V under a condition that the bit lines 28 and 30 are both kept at 1.5V, the TIROS transistors 24 and 26 are both conductive, thereby to forcibly reduce the potential on the bit line 28 toward the ground potential through the MOS transistor 20 which is now conductive. Since the MOS transistor 22 is nonconductive, the potential on the bit line 30 is held at 1.5V. In this way, the data 0 may be read out from the memory cell 100 through the bit lines 28 and 30. It is possible to construct a memory cell array by using a plurality of the memory cells shown in Fig. 3.In this case, as well illustrated in Fig. 4, memory cells on the same column line, for example, memory cells 100 11 and 10 21, are commonly connected to a pair of bit lines 28 1 and 30 1. The memory cells on the same row line, for example, memory cells 100 11 and 100 12, are commonly connected to the same word line 32 1. Turning now to Fig. 5, there is shown an inverting circuit according to another embodiment of the present invention. The inverting circuit shown in Fig. 5 is featured by additionally using an N channel MOS transistor 40 which has a source connected to the drain of the MOS transistor 2 and a substrate connected to the positive terminal of the power source E in the circuit shown in Fig. 1. The drain of the MOS transistor 40 is coupled with a power source terminal VDD impressed with a voltage from 0.4V to 2V, for example. The gate of the transistor 40 is coupled with a precharge terminalVpp to which a two level signal with two levels of 0V and 2V or a precharge pulse is applied immediately before each data is read out.The MOS transistor 40 may be formed in the same manner as the MOS transistor 2 and substrate 8 of the MOS transistor 2 may be commonly used as the substrate of the MOS transistor 40. In the inverting circuit, when an input voltage becomes 0V, the output voltage changes from 0V to 0.4V.That is, the drain potential of the MOS transistor 2 changes from the source potential to the substrate potential. In this case, by applying the precharge pulse to the gate of the MOS transistor 40, it is possible to set the potential at the output terminal 6 or the source potential of the tOS transistor 40 to a high level at a high speed. When the source of the MOS transistor 40 is precharged in this way, the inverting circuit executes the static operation, as previously stated, to hold the output voltage at a value larger than Vo when an input voltage is 0V and at a 0V when an input voltage is at a high level. Fig. 6 is a modification of the memory cell shown in Fig. 3. The memory cell is obtained by removing the bit line 30 and the switching transistor 26 from the memory cell shown in Fig. 3. Also in the memory cell, the read and the write operations are performed in the same manner as in the previous case. For writing the data 1 into the memory cell 200, it is only necessary to set the potential on the bit line 28 to 1.5V and apply a voltage of 2V to the word line 32. Upon this, 1.5V on the line 28 is applied to the gate of the HOS transistor 22, through the 11OS transistor 24, thereby to render the MOS transistor 22 conductive. As a result, the gate of the MOS transistor 20 is set at ground potential, so that the MOS transistor 20 becomes non conductive. For writing the data 0 into the memory cell 200, the potential on the bit line 28 is set to 0V and 2V is applied to the word line 32. Through the operation, 0V is applied to the gate of theMOS transistor 22, by way of the MOS transistor 24, so that the MOS transistor becomes non conductive. As a result, the output voltage Vo of the battery E appears at the drain of the MOS transistor 22, which is in turn applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 20 thereby to render the MOS transistor 20 conductive. In the data read mode, the potential on the bit line 28 is set at 0.5V to 1V, for example, and the potential on the word line 32 is set to 2V When theMOS transistor 20 is non conductive, that is, when the data 1 is stored in the memory cell 200, the potential on the bit line 28 is kept at 0.4V or more, so that the data 1 is read out through the bit line 28. When the tios transistor 20 is conductive, that is, when the data 0 is stored in the memory, the potential on the bit line 28 is lower than the output voltage Vo of the power source , so that the data 0 is read out through the bit line 28. By arranging in a matrix fashion a plurality of memory cells such as memory cells 200 11 to 20022 each constructed like the memory cell shown in Fig. 6, a memory cell array may be constructed as shown inFig. 7. While the invention has been described in its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that within the scope of the invention, various modifications can be made. For example, the N channel MOS transistors for constructing the inverting circuits and the memory cells may be replaced by P channel MOS transistors. In this case, the polarity of the power source voltage is reversed. Further, each of the MOS transistors 2 and 40 may be formed of discrete element, that is, the MOS transistors 2 and 40 may be formed to have a different substrate.
