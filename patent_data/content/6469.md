# A magnetic bubble domain memory system.

## Abstract
A random access bubble memory directs a plurality of continuous streams of bubbles toward a plurality of storage loops 42A, 42B, 42C . A write decoder 16A, 16B, 16X selects one continuous stream of bubbles. An annihilator 30A, 30B, 30X then transforms this one continuous stream of bubbles into the desired data pattern which is then stor ed in a selected loop. While the data pattern is being form ed, a read decoder 44A, 44B, 44X directs the data which had been stored in the selected loop to a bubble detector 52 . This memory has a unified read write cycle which permits intermixed read and write, read modify write, and swap operations. This bubble memory allows a user to re move power abruptly during a read write cycle without returning a partially processed block to its storage loop and without saving the identity of the block. In a preferred em bodiment, the read and write decoders are operated simul taneously by identical control currents.
