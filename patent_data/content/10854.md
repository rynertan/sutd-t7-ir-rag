# Process for heat treating moving glass sheets on a modified gas bed.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of tempering of glass sheets comprising heating each of a series of glass sheets to an elevated temperature sufficient for tempering and then subjecting each said hot glass sheet to flows of cold tempering medium applied against the opposite major surfaces thereof at a rate sufficiently high to chill the hot glass sheet and impart at least a partial temper thereto characterised in that said cold tempering medium is initial ly applied in the form of a plurality of thin, discrete, laminar streams against each of the opposite major surfaces of said glass sheet for sufficient time to harden said major surfaces but insufficient time to cause the sheet to flutter, and then additional cold tempering medium is immediately applied in a more diffuse pattern that provides a smoother support bed for said glass sheets than said discrete streams against said opposite major surfaces to provide the desired degree of temper of said glass sheets. It also includes apparatus for tempering hot glass sheets.
