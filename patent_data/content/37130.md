# Arrangement for calculating the discrete fourier transform by means of two circular convolutions.

## Abstract
Method of a N point discrete Fourier transform. The original set, consisting of N input data elements a k k O, 1,2, ... N 1 is converted into two sets of data elements b₁ q q 1,2, ... M and b₂ q q 1,2, ... M, which each comprise M N 1 2 data elements, each ele ment being a linear combination of two of the original input data elements a k . These sequences are circularly con volved with the impulse response h₁ v α cos g The desired output data element can be obtained by means of a linear combination of the data elements y₁ p , y₂ p and a 0 .
