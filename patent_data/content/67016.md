# Article suitable for wiping hard surfaces.

## Abstract
An article is disclosed which is suitable for wiping hard surfaces such as glass to give a streak free finish. The article comprises a substrate preferably paper or nonwoven fabric carrying a homogeneous aqueous composition having a sur face tension below 45 mNm ¹ and which on drying does not form discrete droplets or particles larger than 0.25 µm. The li quid composition advantageously includes a preferably non ionic surface active agent and a partially esterified resin such as a partially esterified styrene maleic anhydride copolymer. The article may be wet for example, coated or impregnated with the liquid composition or dry up to the point of use for example, the liquid may be within pressure rupturable micro capsules . Preferably the article is produced by a process which includes prewashing the substrate to remove any poten tially streak forming impurities.
