# ELECTROMAGNETIC BOREHOLE LOGGING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for determining the dielectric constant and or resistivity of an earth formation which is subject to invasion of fluid, for example drilling fluid from a borehole. A transmitter 17 transmits electromagnetic energy at about 20 MHz. from a first location in the borehole. Three receivers 22, 23, 24 are spaced at locations succes sively further away from the transmitter. Amplitude ratio means 140 derives the ratio of the amplitudes of the received energies at the two nearest of the three receivers, and a phase difference means derives the phase difference between the received energies at the two furthest of these three receivers. The dielectric constant and the resistivity are determined from the amplitude ratio and the phase difference.
