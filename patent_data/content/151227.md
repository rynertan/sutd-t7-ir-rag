## Description
METHOD AND DEVICE IN CONNECTION WITH CONVEYOR BELTSTECHNICAL FIELDThe invention relates to a method of accomplishing good sealing between on the one hand a conveyor belt, moving on supporting rollers, spaced apart, and on the other hand sealing skirts, in engagement with the top side of the moving belt, with the purpose of preventing the escape of conveyed material between the belt and the skirting, by letting the bottom side of the belt slide against supporting elements close to the skirting. The invention also relates to the design of said supporting elements.BACKGROUND ARTMethods and devices of the above type are known e.g. from the patentsUS 2 681 134, US 2 685 958, and DE 25 10 407. These known devices may work to satisfaction when the skirting is so flexible that it may be turned inwards without the use of extensive force, causing the turnedin part to bear resiliently against the top side of the conveyor belt.If, on the other hand, the skirting is made of a sturdier and or stiffer material, which may often be required in connection with some materials to be conveyed, it has not been possible to accomplish efficient sealing between the belt and the skirting according to prior art. Examples of this type of sealing devices are described for example in DE 24 16 963, US 3 499 523, US 4 204 595,US 4 231 471, and US 4 236 628. The reason for leakage is the fact that the conveyor belt sags between the rollers. To stop leakage caused by sagging the sealing devices have in some cases been designed to follow the profile of the belt as it sags, or the conveyor been provided with more closely spaced rollers. The latter solution is expensive, however, and even if the rollers are very closely spaced sagging cannot be avoided completely.In addition wear is concentrated on the skirting in the regions of the supporting rollers, perhaps making necessary the replacement of the skirting already after a short time of use, although only a minor part of it has been severely abraded. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThe purpose of the invention is to provide a solution to the above problems. More specifically, a purpose is to provide a good seal in connection with any type of skirting, i.e. soft, flexible as well as stiffer and or sturdier skirting.Another purpose of the invention is that it may be put to use in connection with any type of belt conveyor.These and other purposes are served by making the supporting elements elastic and making them counteract sagging of the belt in between the rollers in the area of the skirting, the supporting elements resiliently making sure that the top side of the belt slides against the skirting without any leakage.The elastic supporting elements generally may be designed according to different principles. Preferably, a purpose of the invention, however, is to offer an elastic supporting element with advantages which are very special in this context. According to the preferred embodiment these advantages may be gained by letting the supporting element consist of a composite material mounted on a carrier, said material comprising at least one wear layer, consisting of a first elastomeric substance with a hardness exceeding 800 Shore A and at least one elastic layer between the wear layer and the carrier, consisting of a second polymeric substance with a hardness of 0 between 15 and 60 Shore A.Among the advantages obtained with a supporting element of this construction may be mentioned the simplicity of the element, making it cheap to manufacture and to install. Further, an elastic supporting element, consisting of a composite material, may adapt to the different load conditions between the supporting rollers. In contrast to completely rigid supporting elements, the element according to the invention thus may be compressed at that point where the contact pressure against the belt is greatest, whereby is avoided that large enough contact pressure develops between the top side of the belt and the skirting to cause excessive heat and wear or to create great brake forces, which would influence the driving means of the belt unfavourably.In other words, a supporting element according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a large enough spring force to maintain a contact between the belt and the skirting which prevents leaking, without making the contact forces large enough to cause great wear on the belt or to brake it.The wear layer of the supporting element is to be made of a material which does not resist gliding against the conveyor belt, i.e. has a comparatively low coefficient of friction, and is wear resistant.One such material is polyurethane. The wear layer therefore substantially consists of polyurethane. The resilient layer suitably consists of porous rubber, preferably so called mousse rubber, the pores of which are open in contrast to the pores of cellular rubber.The wear layer in turn may consist of two layers which both substantially consist of polyurethane but have a somewhat different composition. In order further to reduce the friction the outer layer contains one or more friction lowering substances mixed with the polyurethane. A suitable substance is polytetrafluorethene PTFE which may be supplied as a powder to the molten polyurethane before it has set. The PTFE content should be at least 10 by weight, preferably 15 25 . Other possible friction decreasing agents which may be added are graphite 5 20 , silicon oil and polyethylene powder.Polyurethane containing substantial amounts of one or more antifriction agents, however, has a poor adherence to rubber. Therefore an intermediate comparatively thin layer of polyurethane which contains no friction decreasing agent should be provided between the surface layer and the rubber layer. This second polyurethane layer has a different colour than the surface layer the wear layer .The purpose of this arrangement is to get an indication that the wear layer needs reconditioning, when the wear layer has been worn down to the inner layer so that the signal colour shines through.An advantage of the composite material according to the invention is also that in such a case a new wear layer may be applied by spraying on a new layer of polyurethane.It is possible also to build the resilient layer of more than one material. It would be conceivable to put a shock absorbing layer of tread rubber or some comparable material either between the wear layer and the porous, springy rubber layer and or between the porous, resilient rubber layer and a carrier. It is suitable to let the latter consist of a metal rail.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the patent claims and in the following description of a preferred embodiment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGSIn the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, reference will be made to the attached drawings, of whichFig. 1 is a perspective view of a conveyor belt and the associated devices at a point of loading Fig. 2 is a sectional view illustrating the function of the sealing devices andFig. 3 is a sectional view of a supporting element in conjunction with a side element which is part of the integrated equip ment for the sealing function.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTIn Fig. 1 a belt conveyor is generally designated by the numeral 1.A conveyor belt is designated 2 and a loading chute 3. A part of the belt after the chute 3 is covered by a hood 4. The goods are loaded directly onto the conveyor belt 2 from the chute 3, and to prevent the escape of material from the belt to the sides sealing skirts 5 are provided. These skirts extend from the sides of the hood 4 and the chute 3 down onto the top side of the belt, with which they engage near the edges of the belt.According to the invention a good seal is obtained between the skirting 5 and the top side of the belt 2 by keeping the belt 2 in engagement with the skirting 5 also in the regions between the supporting rollers 6 for the belt 2. To this end, a supporting element 7 is arranged along the edges of the belt between each set of rollers 6. In other words the supporting elements are arranged underneath the skirts 5. Each such supporting element 7 comprises a carrier 8, in the form of a rail made from an angle iron. The rail 8 is mounted over a bottom beam 9 by means of supporting props 10.A mounting hole has been designated 11 in Fig. 3. To the rail 8 has been glued an elastic body 12, extending along the entire length of the carrier 8. This elastic body 12 according to the embodiment consists of porous rubber, more specifically so called mousse rubber with a hardness of about 20 to 250 Shore A. The thickness is decided according to the field of application and may vary from 8 to 200 mm.Normally, however, the elastic layer 12 is between 10 and 50 mm thick, which means that it is between 4 and 20 times, normally between 5 and 10 times as thick as a wear layer 13 arranged on top of the elastic layer 12. The thickness of the wear layer 13 may thus vary between about 2 and 10 mm This wear layer 13 substantially consists of polyurethane, containing additives which lower the already low coefficient of friction of the polyurethane. More particularly the layer 13 is applied in two strata, viz. an inner, thinner layer 14 of a bright signal colour, and an outer layer 15, somewhat thicker. The inner layer 14 contains no friction reducing additives and has a good adherence to the porous rubber body 12 as well as to the outer wear layer 15 which contains about 20 by weight polytetrafluorethene PTFE . The purposes of this arrangement are many the friction is reduced, the adherence to the rubber layer is improved, and there is obtained an indication that the wear layer needs reco itioning, as the signal colour begins to shine through. The wear layer 15 may be renewed by spraying polyurethane onto the older substrate. The hardness of the outer layer 15 is about 950 Shore A and of the inner layer 14 about 90 920 Shore A.
