# Hot tackifying adhesive tape.

## Abstract
Hot tackifying adhesive tape, the adhesive layer of which is an acrylic polymer which is nontacky or poorly tacky at ordinary room temperature, but at any temperature over a wide range of elevated temperatures, it becomes tacky and adheres upon contact to clean substrates without the application of significant pressure. Good bonds are immediately formed at a tackifying temperature without the necessity of crosslinking or other chemical reactions.

## Description
HOT TACKIFYING ADHESIVE TAPE Technical Field The invention concerns a heat activatable adhesive tape that is wound upon itself in roll form for convenience in storage and use and is especially concerned with tapes having adhesive layers which contain electrically conductive particles. Background Art The adhesive layer of most heat activatable adhesive tapes now on the market has a rather narrow melting point range. Such a tape is called a hot melt adhesive tape, because its adhesive layer is melted at the bonding temperature. At temperatures within 100C below the bonding temperature, the adhesive may not even be tacky.Because the adhesive has virtually no strength at the bonding temperature, a clamp may be used until a strong bond develops, either by cooling or by cueing. If the bond is later heated to a temperature at or above the initial bonding temperature, the bond will fail unless the adhesive has become cured, e.g., by crosslinking. If the adhesive becomes cured when heated, the tape tends to have a limited shelf life, especially if stored in ordinary warehouses which may become quite hot during the day. Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes can be formulated to provide immediate bonding strength, usually called wet grab . Bonds made therewith tend to retain good strength at moderately elevated temperatures, but may weaken to the point of failure at higher temperatures. One such tape, having a heat shrinkable backing, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,718,495 Tomita . After being wound upon an object as a protective covering, heat is applied to cause the backing to shrink tightly around the object.However, its adhesive layer may become so soft upon further heating that the outermost wrap may become loose. U.S. Patent No. 3,475,213 Stow discloses a pressure sensitive adhesive tape having an electricallyconductive backing and an adhesive layer containing electrically conductive metal particles which preferably are flattened. When applied to electrical conductors such as are on one face of a printed circuit board, the particles conduct electricity between the conductors and the backing. Under conditions encountered in use, the particles tend to move about, gradually resulting in increased electrical resistance unless the assembly has a permanent clamp, but this is expensive. In both of these constructions, hot tackifying adhesives would find great utility because of the ability thereof to retain bond strengths at elevated temperatures. Disclosure of the Invention The invention concerns a heatractivatable adhesive tape that can be wound upon itself in roll form for convenience in storage and use and is nontacky or poorly tacky at ordinary room temperature 200C 1 but differs fron heat activatable adhesive tapes of the prior art in that its adhesive layer becomes pressure sensitive and aggressively tacky when heated. Good bonds are immediateil formed at a tackifying temperature without any need for crosslinking or other chemical reactions. Hence, the nove tape may be called a hot tackifying adhesive tape. When later subjected to temperatures at or even above the bonding temperature, adequate bond strength may be retained.Because of this, the novel tape is particularly useful in the tape forms disclosed in the aforementionedTomita and Stow patents and the below mentioned OlyphantPatent No. 3,497,383. When the novel tape has a form as disclosed in the Stow patent, the electrically conductive particles tend to remain in place, and the adhesive is resistant to flow between the particles and the electric3 conductors with which they are in adhesive contact even c elevated temperatures. In such form, the electrically conductive particles may comprise from 0.1 to 40 volume percent of the adhesive layer. Like heat activatable adhesive tapes of the prior art, the hot tackifying tape of the invention has a flexible, heat resistant backing. To illustrate, the backing may be a plastic film which may be heat shrinkable in the lengthwise direction, a conductive metal foil such as copper or aluminum, or a fibrous web such as woven glass fibers. The adhesive layer may incorporate lineallyaligned reinforcing filaments or may contain short, randomly intermingled fibers or other reinforcing material.Like many adhesive tapes of the prior art, the adhesive layer of the novel tape comprises an acrylic polymer or mixture of acrylic polymers of at least one alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate ester monomer here called acrylic ester monomer such as ethyl acrylate. As in the prior art, better cohesive and adhesive strengths are attainable if the adhesive Slayer comprises an acrylic copolymer or mixture of acrylic copolymers of acrylic ester monomer and at least one copolymerizable monomer having a polar group. Other copolymerizable monomers may also be employed in various amounts without detracting from the value of the acrylic copolymer for the purposes of the invention. Among such copolymerizable monomers are styrene, vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride, which when used are preferably used in amounts up to 5 mol percent of the total monomers. The adhesive layer of the hot tackifying tape of the invention differs from adhesive layers of prior heat activatable tapes in that 1 the acrylic ester monomer provides at least 50 mol percent of the one or more acrylic polymers of the adhesive layer, 2 the one or more acrylic polymers have a Tg glass transition temperature or a weight averaged Tg of 10 to 80 C, 3 the adhesive layer has a a Probe Tack Value as defined below of less than 75 grams of force gf at 200C b Probe Tack Values of at least 75 gf over a range of at least 500C, which values remain substantially constant after 30 days at 400C, and c a Shear Value as defined below of at least 25 minutes at 65 C, and 4 up to 50 mol percent of the one or more acrylic polymers can be provided by copolymerizable monomer having a polar group, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid or anhydride, the amides of said acids, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone.The one or more acrylic polymers may be a homopolymer of a acrylic ester monomer which provides a Tg within the range of 100 to 800C, e.g., methyl acrylate, or a copolymer of acrylic ester monomer and copolymerizable polar monomer having a Tg within that range. Useful acrylic ester monomers which homopolymerize to a Tg of at least lQ C include methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylates, butyl methacrylates, borny acrylates, bornyl methacrylates, 2 phenoxyethyl acrylate, 2 phenoxyethyl methacrylate, the mono and di methyl and ethyl esters of itaconic acid, and the mono and di methy and ethyl esters of maleic acid. Useful acrylic ester monomers which provide reduced Tg include ethyl, butyl, an octyl acrylates, and n amyl, hexyl and octyl methacrylatesA copolymer of 43 mol percent of methyl methacrylate, 53 mol percent of methyl acrylate and 4 mol percent of acrylamide had a weight averaged Tg of about 500C. A copolymer of 73 mol percent of methyl methacrylate, 19 mol percent of methyl acrylate, 4 mol percent of ethyl acrylate, and 4 mol percent of acrylamide had a weightaveraged Tg of about 790C. If the Tg or weight averaged Tg were below 1Q0 the adhesive layer might not form bonds having desirable high strength at elevated temperatures, but if above 800C, bonding temperatures might be undesirably high and the bonds might be unduly brittle at cold temperatures. When heated about 500C above its Tg or weightaveraged Tgt the adhesive layer becomes sufficiently tacky to form useful bonds with applied pressure. Bonds are more readily made at higher temperatures, preferably near the midpoint of the range of temperatures at which the ProbeTack Value is at least 75 gf. The bonds will retain useful strength at any temperature within the range at which theProbe Tack Value is at leas 75 gf. Typical hot tackifying tapes of the invention have Probe Tack Values of at least 75 gf over a range of at least 800C, and in some cases more than 1100C. At any temperature at which the Probe Tack Value is at least 75 gf, the adhesive layer should be sufficiently compliant to adhere well to a clean substrate upon contact without the application of significant pressure. At ,any temperature at which the Probe Tack Value is substantially less than 75 gf, the adhesive layer is not sufficiently compliant to form good bonds reliably. Because the Probe Tack Values remain substantially constant after 30 days at 400C, the hot tackifying tape of the invention can be shipped and stored in commerce and later put to use with the same effect as freshly prepared tape. The bond making ability of the hot tackifying tape can be measured in terms of shear creep compliance as in U.S. Patent No. 3,790,439 LaPerre et al . At ordinary room temperature, the tape has a 10 second shear creep compliance of less than about 0.5 x 10 6 cm2 dyne and is too firm to flow out and wet a smooth substrate to form a good bond. At the bonding temperature, the 10 second shear creep compliance should exceed about 1 x 10 cm2 dyne, above which the adhesive will be soft enough to flow out and wet a smooth substrate to form a good bond. At the mid point of the range of temperatures over which the hot tackifying tape has Probe Tack Values exceeding 75 gf, the 1000 second shear creep compliance should be less than about 5 x 10 cm2 dyne in order to be sufficiently firm to present adequate resistance to shear forces over long periods of time. In addition, the novel hot tackifying acrylic adhesive tape of this invention differs from prior tapes in that it can form bonds to inorganic substrates that exhibit surprisingly good resistance to failure upon prolonged exposure to high humidity e.g., 95 RH at elevated temperatures e.g., 800C , if the acrylic polymer has an interacted functionally reactive organosilane coupling agent in an amount of at least 0.2 part per 100 parts by weight of total monomer. Below about 0.2 part that surprising result is not attained. Best results are attained at about 0.5 to 4 percent. Larger amounts are considered wasteful and might cause short hot life. The organosilane may be interpolymerized with the acrylic ester monomer, with or without other copolymerizable monomers, or it may be reacted with functional groups on the backbone of an acrylic polymer.Either process results in what is hereinafter called an acrylic silane interpolymer . The organosilane has the general formula R 4n SiXn, where X is a hydrolyzable group such as ethoxy, methoxy, or 2 methoxy ethoxy R is a monovalent organic radical of from 1 to 12 carbo n atoms which contains a functional organic group such as mercapto, epoxy, acrylyl, methacrylyl, or amino and n is an integer of from 1 to 3. As is known in the art, the organisilane can cause solutions of polymers to gel, so that it may be desirable to employ an alcohol or other known stabilizers.When the organosilane is to be copolyerized with the other monomer, a stabilizer should be selected that does not interfere with the polymerization. Methanol is especially useful and is preferably employed in amounts from about twice to about four times the amount of the organosilane. The Drawing In the drawing which schematically illustrates a number of tapes embodying the invention Fig. 1 shows a roll of one embodiment and an edge of an unwound portion Fig. 2 is an edge view of a second embodiment Fig. 3 is an edge view of a third embodiment Fig. 4 is an end view of a fourth embodiment Fig. 5 is an end view of a fifth embodiment Fig. 6 shows the adhesive face of a sixth embodiment and Fig. 7 is an edge view of a seventh embodiment. The tape of Fig. 1 has a backing 10, a hottackifying adhesive layer 12, an adhesion promoting primer coating 14, and a low adhesion backsize coating 16. The backing 10 may be a plastic film which may be heat shrinkable or may be paper. If the backing had a release surface or layer instead of the primer coating 14, the adhesive layer 12 could be removed from the backing ,for use as a transfer adhesive. The tape of Fig. 2 has a fibrous backing 20 such as paper, cloth or a carded, heat fused web and a hottackifying adhesive layer 22 directly in contact with the backing. Because of the fibrous nature of the backing 20, the adhesive may become mechanically interlocked into interstices of one face of the backing, so that no adhesion promoting primer layer is necessary. However, a low adhesion backsize coating 26 or a disposable liner, not shown prevents the adhesive layer 22 from becoming mechanically interlocked with the other face of the fibrous backing 20 when the tape is wound upon itself into roll form. The tape of Fig. 3 has an electrically conductive metal foil backing 30 carrying a layer of hot tackifying adhesive 32 containing a plurality of electrically conductive metal particles 33 which preferably are flat as indicated and may have a thickness approximating the overall thickness of the adhesive layer 32. Tapes containing such particles are taught in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 3,475,213. No adhesion promoting primer layer is required inasmuch as the hot tackifying adhesive layer of the invention tends to adhere strongly to metal backings, but there is a low adhesion backsize coating 36 to permit unwinding from a roll. The tape of Fig. 4 has a plastic film backing 4C and a layer of hot tackifying adhesive 42 containing flat electrically conductive metal particles 43 comparable to the metal particles 33 of Fig. 3. The adhesive face of t backing 40 bears four electrically conductive stripes 45 which may be metal and preferably are thin films and hence of negligible thickness. The opposite face of the backing 40 has a low adhesion backsize coating 46. The tape of Fig. 5 has a plastic filin backing 5C bearing three electrically conductive stripes 55 similar t those of the tape of Fig. 4. Applied over each of the stripes 55 is a stripe of hot tackifying adhesive 52 containing flat electrically conductive metal particles 53, the thicknesses of which approximate twice the average dried thickness of the stripes of the adhesive 52. Apple over the adhesive 52 and the spaces between the stripes ic a layer of unfilled hot tackifying adhesive 57, the dried thickness of which approximates that of the adhesive 52. The uncoated face of the backing 50 has a low adhesion backsize coating 56. When the tape of Fig. 5 is heated tc a temperature at which the adhesive 57 becomes tacky and laid against rigid electrical conductor, pressure again the backing 50 produces electrical contact between the co ductor and the conductive stripes 55, the excess adhesive 52 and 57 flowing into the spaces between the stripes. Fig. 6 shows the face of a tape having alternating longitudinal stripes of a hot tackifying adhesive and an ordinary pressure sensitive adhesive 67 carried bE backing not shown . The pressure sensitive adhesive provides immediate bonding at room temperature, and the strength of the bond is appreciably increased by heating to a temperature at which the adhesive 62 becomes aggressively tacky. The heat activated bond provided by the hottackifying adhesive 62 retains good strength upon subsequent exposure to temperatures at or somewhat above its bonding temperature. Instead of longitudinal stripes, the two types of adhesive could be applied in any desired pattern. Fig. 7 shows the edge of a tape having an electrically conductive metal foil backing 70 and two layers of hot tackifying adhesive 72A and 72B, each containing flat electrically conductive metal particles 73A and 73B, respectively. The double coated metal foil backing is supported by a disposable carrier web 78 which has low adhesion surfaces, such as may be provided by a pair of low adhesion coatings 76 and 79, and is shown being stripped away. 650C Shear Value Heat a bright annealed stainless steel panel in an oven for 15 minutes at 1150C above the weight averaged Tg of the adhesive polymer. With the steel panel horizontal, adhere part of a tape 1.27 cm in width to the steel panel using a 2.04 kg hand roller conforming toFederal Standard 147, giving 2 passes in each direction.Trim the length of tape adhering to the panel to exactly 1.27 cm in length and leave this assembly at the bonding temperature for 15 minutes longer. Transfer the plate to an oven having a shear stand which allows a 20 backward tilt of the panel at its top shear weight will force tape toward panel slightly . After 15 minutes at 650C, hang a l kg weight from the free end of the tape. The time at which the weight falls is the 650C Shear Value. The test is discontinued if no failure has been detected after a prolonged period, usually 1100 or 1400 minutes. Probe Tack Value The Probe Tack Value is determined as described in AST D 2979 except in the following respects 1. To provide Probe Tack Values at various test temperatures, the probe and the annular weight are heated to the test temperature, except that the annular weight is never heated above 2200C. 2. The probe end is an annulus having inner and outer diameters of 3.83 and 5.10 mm. 3. The annular weight is 19.8 g. 4. Ten second dwell. In the following examples, all parts are given by weight, except as noted. Example 1 An acrylic terpolymer was made by mixing together 36 parts ethyl acrylate, 59 parts me thyl acrylate, 5 parts acrylic acid, 286 parts ethyl acetate and 0.1 part azo bis isobutylnitrile 1Vazo 1 64 catalyst , purging the mixture with nitrogen to remove oxygen, and heating at 53 550C for 16 hours to give 98 995 conversion to polymer.Weight averaged Tg of this polymer was OOC. After diluting with ethyl acetate and adding .05 part isophthaloyl bis propylene imine curing agent per 100 parts solids, this adhesive composition was coated onto one face of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film backing 25 micrometers thick, which face had an adhesion promoting primer coating as described in U.S. Pat.No. 4,060,664. The opposite face of the film backing had a low adhesion backsize coating as described in U.S. Pat. No 2,532,011. After the acrylic polymer coating had been dried and cured a total of 6 minutes at temperatures ranging from 430C to 1040C to provide a hot tackifying adhesive tape of the invention, the tape was then slit to width of 2.54 cm and wound upon itself for storage. The dried thickness of the adhesive layer was 30 micrometers.Test results are reported below Lowest temserature at which the Probe Tack Value was 75 gf or more 500 Highest temperature at which the Probe Tack Value was 75 gf or more 150 C Maximum Probe Tack Value 364 gf at 1100C Bonding temperature used to prepare for testing 65 C Shear Value 115 C 650C Shear Value in minutes 1100 . 10 second shear creep compliance at 230C 2.2x10 7cmê dyne 10 second shear creep compliance at bonding temperature 2.9x10 6cm2 dyne 1000 second shear creep com pliance at l000C 1.2x10 5cm2 dyne Examples 2 9 Additional acrylic terpolymers were made as inExample 1, except. with monomer compositions as shown below Example No. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Ethyl Acrylate 68 40 4Methyl Acrylate 27 56 91 84.6 71.7 n ButyllMethacrylate 83 68 75Methyl Methacrylate 10.4 23.3 10 25 25Acrylic Acid 5 5 5 5Methacrylic Acid 7 7 Acrylamide 4 Nieight averaged Tg in C 10 0 10 20 30 35 46 37 Tapes were made as in Example 1 using te acrylic terpolymers of Examples 2 6 except that no curing agent was used in the adhesive composition of the tapes of Examples 3 and 9.

This tape was dried and cured as in Example 1, then slit to a width of 1.27 cm and wound upon itself for storage. In spite of the adhesive nature of the composition of Example 6, it acted as if it were a low adhesion backsize coating, thus enabling the tape to be unwound without delamination. After being unwound, it was tested with the following results Probe Tack Value at 1500C 241 gf 650C Shear Value 370 minutes. Example 11 A low adhesion backsize coating was applied to on face of a carded fiber web Pellon 7605 consisting of a compacted mixture of approximately 70 parts of drawn polyethylene terephthalate fibers and 30 parts amorphous polyethylene terephthalate fibers. To the other face was applied a coating of the adhesive composition of Example 1 followed by drying and curing for 3 minutes at 65 C and the for 3 minutes at 1040C. A carrier web having low adhesion surfaces was laid over the dried adhesive coating, and the whole was wound upon itself for storage. Probe Tack Value at 600C 308 gf 650C Shear Value 1100 minutes.Roll aging was simulated by first bonding at 1150C a 2.54 cr wide strip of the tape to a steel plate and a 1.27 cm wide strip of the tape with its adhesive side against the backinc of the first strip. A second steel plate was laid on the top strip, and weights were applied to exert a pressure of approximately 93 gf per cm2 against the top strip. After 1 hours at 650C and cooling to room temperature, the top stri was readily peeled from the bottom strip without any delamination. Example 12 Fine silver spherical particles were sieved withTyler sieves, and the cut passing 140 mesh 104 micrometer openings and held on 170 mesh 89 micrometer openings was selected. Of this selected powder, 77 g was mixed with 1000 g of vehicle 57 parts low molecular weight polyisobutylene and 43 parts mineral oil , flattened in a 3 roll paint. mill, and the flattened metal particles were separated and washed with toluene to remove the vehicle.After drying, the silver particles were sieved sb that the diameters in the widest direction were all over 104 micrometers. Microscopic examination showed that for this fraction, about 90 of the particles were substantially flattened, 54 were moderately flattened and 5 did not appear to be flattened. All had a thickness of approximately 70 micrometers. An amount of the adhesive composition ofExample 3 containing 100 parts of solids was mixed with 29.5 parts of the flattened silver particles plus 2.8 parts of disalicylalpropylene diamine E. I. duPont CopperInhibitor 50 and 2.4 parts of antioxidant. The mixture was then coated onto a low adhesion carrier web and dried for a total of six minutes at temperatures ranging from 430C to 1040C. The thickness of the dried adhesive layer approximated that of the silver particles. The silver containing adhesive layer was transferred to dead soft rolled copper foil 305 g m2 by rolling from the carrier side at 11SOC, Probe Tack Value at 1500C 136 gf 650C Shear Value 25 minutes.Resistance was measured by cutting out 1 cm square from a plastic film of 25 micrometers thickness, laying this against dead soft copper foil, and laying the test tape over the cut out, with adhesive side down. After heating to 1700C, pressing and cooling, resistance between the two copper foils was less than .001 ohm. After again heating at 90 C for 16 hours, without applying pressure, and cooling to room temperature, the resistance was .001 ohm.All resistance tests were run without applying pressure. Example 13 The adhesive composition of Example 3 was diluted with ethyl acetate to 19 solids. Then 1 part of disalicylalpropylene diamine and 2.5 parts of antioxidant per 100 parts of adhesive solids were added. This adhesive composition was coated onto dead soft rolled copper foil 305 g m2 , dried, and interleafed with a carrier web having low adhesion surfaces. The carrier web was peeled off and substituted by a similar carrier web which was held in a taut condition and joined to the adhesive layer between the nip of two heated steel rolls. The roll contacting the carrier web was smooth, and the other roll had an embossing pattern consisting of 2 sets of raised fine lines on centers of 1.59 mm, the 2 sets being at right angles to each other, leaving a pattern of depressed squares on the embossing roll as illustrated in Fig. 3 of U.S. Patent o. 3,497,383 Olyphant, Jr. et al. . All the raised lines ran in a direction inclined 45 to the direction of rotation, so that diagonals of the squares were in the direction of rotation.While both rolls were at 2800C, they were pressed together with a gauge pressure of 2100 g cm2 distributed across the 25 cm wide web, thus creating the fine lines in the copper foil which reached the surface of the adhesive at the carrier web. The whole was slit to a width of 2.54 cm and wound up for storage. After peeling off the carrier web, the foil backed tape was shown to effectively shield against radio frequency signals without need for a clamp to hold it in place. Example 14 Fine annealed spherical copper particles were sifted to pass 200 mesh 74 micrometer openings and be held on 230 mesh 63 micrometer openings and then flattened and again sifted as in Example 12. About 85 of the particles were substantially flattened, 10 moderately flattened and 5 not flattened. All had a thickness of approximately 48 micrometers. An amount of the adhesive of Example 3 containinc 100 parts solids was mixed with 24 parts of the flattened copper particles plus 2.8 parts of disalicylalpropylene diamine and 2.4 parts of antioxidant. This was coated ont dead soft rolled copper foil 305 g m2 and dried 75 seconds at 570C and 75 seconds at 1270C to a thickness approximating that of the copper particles. A disposable carrier we having low adhesion surfaces was laid over the dried coating, and the whole was slit to widths of 2.5 cm and wound up for storage. Probe Tack Value at 1500C 179 gf 650C Shear Value 34 minutes Resistance, fresh as in Example 12 below .001 ohm per cm2 Resistance, aged 16 hours at 900C and cooled .001 ohm per cm2 Example 15 Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film which had 53 shrinkage in the lengthwise direction when heated to 1500C was primed and backsized as inExample 1. It was then coated on the primed side with the adhesive of Example 1, and dried 6 minutes at 650C, higher temperatures being avoided to keep from shrinking the film during drying. This was slit to tapes 2.54 cm in width which were wound upon themselves.A steel gear, 1.27 cm wide by 3.02 cm in diameter at the tips of the teeth and 2.11 cm in diameter between the teeth, was heated to 700C and wrapped circumferentially with the tape to provide a .63 cm long overlap, ending on the flat face of a tooth.The wrapped gear was then heated with an air gun, shrinking the tape snugly around the gear, with the tape attached firmly and evenly to the sides of the gear. Probe Tack Value at 1100C 358 gf 650C Shear Value 1400 minutes Example 16 A hot tackifying tape of the invention was made using as the backing biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film of 25 micrometers thickness which had been heat treated to deveLop superior thermal dimensional stability. Metallic silver stripes were applied by vapor deposition to a thickness of 25 nm and a width of 0.89 mm on 1.78 mm centers. An acrylic terpolyner was made as in Example 1, except that the monomer composition was 10.4 parts methyl methacrylate, 85.6 parts methyl acrylate, and 4.0 parts acrylamide. Its weight averaged Tg was 200C. The hot tackifying acrylic terpolymer adhesive was mixed with flattened silver metal particles having diameters from 76 to 102 micrometers and thicknesses about 25 micrometers.The particles comprised about 8 by volume of the mixture which was coated through a mask in stripes in register with the vapor deposited silver stripes. Each adhesive stripe was about 13 micrometers in thickness after drying. Then the hot tackifying adhesive of Example 3 was coated uniformly over the entire striped face and dried to a thickness of about 13 micrometers. At the same time a lowadhesion backsze was applied to the other face of the tape. This was slit to widths of 2.54 cm, each tape havinc 17 pairs of silver metal stripes and .silver particle fillet adhesive stripes. The tapes were wound upon themselves into rolls. A piece of the tape 3.7 cm in length was applied to an unheated printed circuit board using a press, the moving platen of which was preheated to 1700C. Each pair of stripes of the tape matched a conductive lead on the face of the circuit board adhered length 0.6 cm . A pressure of 119 kgf ca2 was applied for 5 seconds. The other end of the piece of tape was applied in the same way to an unheated indium tin oxide coating on glass adhered length 0.6 cm . After cooling to room temperature, the average resistance per channel was 237 ohms. After aging at 90 C for 619 hours and cooling to room temperature, the resistance per channel increased to 350 ohms.This rather modest increase in resistivity suggests that good electrical conductivity should be retained after prolong periods of use during which the adhesive may become rather warm due to electrical conduction and other phenomena. The outer adhesive material, because of its lowe Tg, enables adhesive bonding at lower temperatures than would an adhesive layer composed only of the inner adens atrial. However, the presence of the inner adhesive material enhances high temperature performance. Example 17 A resist solution was made by mixing 800 grams polystyrene resin, 160 grams of dioctylphthalate, 1222 g of toluene, 2 grams of oil soluble blue dye, and 6 grams oil soluble yellow dye. This solution was coated throng mask with slots, each 0.53 mm wide on 1.79 mm centers, o unprimed, backsized, biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film 25 micrometers thick which had been heat treated to develop superior thermal dimensional stability. After drying to provide a striped resist pattern, about 5 nm of silver were deposited by vapor coating, covering both the resist stripes and the spaces between them. The resist was then pulled away, leaving pattern of vapor deposited silver stripes.The striped polyester film was then heated for 10 minutes at 1500C t anchor the silver more securely. A solution of the adhesive of Example 3 was diluted to 25 solids, and mixed with small amounts of oil soluble dyes plus 2.96 parts disalicylalpropylene diamine and 2.6 parts antioxidant per 100 parts adhesive solids. Just before coating, this was mixed with 50.2 parts per 100 parts adhesive solids of flattened spheric silver that passed through a 140 mesh Tyler sieve 104 micrometer openings and was retained on a 200 mesh Tyle sieve 74 micrometer openings . While being stirred vigorously, this was coated onto the silvered side of th polyester film using the same mask to apply an adhesive stripe over each silver stripe. After drying, the double striped tape was wound up with a liner for storagIts adhesive stripes were between 25 and 30 micrometers thick and silver particles protruded above the mean adhesive surface 6 to 13 micrometers.The silver partic comprised about 4.8 volume percent of the adhesive layer Peel adhesion from glass according to AST D 1000 except for substrate and bonding method was between 5.2 and 7.9 x 10 5 dynes per cm of width including gaps between the adhesive stripes . The tape was tested by bonding it as in Example 16 except at 4.2 kgf cm2 to a circuit board which had 17 channels provided by strips of solder covered copper foil, each about 0.9 mm wide on 1.79 mm centers. There was a 2.54 cm gap in the lengthwise direction in these strips, and the tape was applied so that each pair of adhesive and vapor coated stripes bridged the gap in each strip of copper foil. The following test results are averages of measuring each of the 17 channels at room temperature After 6000 hours at 70QC, resistance per channel rose from an average initial value of 8 ohms to an average of 13 ohms. After thermal cycling for 6000 hours between 400C and 700C, using a 4 hour cycle, with one hour at each temperature and 2 hours at intermediate tempera tures, resistance per channel rose from 7.5 ohms initially to 14 ohms. After a humidity soak for 6000 hours at 908 relative humidity and S00C, resistance rose from an initial value of 7.5 ohms to 14 ohms. Example 18 Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film was primed and backsized as in Example 1, and then coated in stripes with a solution of the hot tackifying acrylic terpolymer of Example 16 containing blue dye. The stripes were each approximately 0.89 mm wide, on 1.78 mm centers. After drying, a solution of a pressure sensitive adhesive was coated in stripes between the stripes of the adhesive terpolymer. The pressure sensitive adhesive comprised by weight 44.28 natural rubber, 8.84 ZnO, 1.87 carbon black, 8.848 wood rosin, 26.52 polyterpene resin softening at 1150C, 8.84 heat reactive phenolic resin ar 0.83 antioxidant.After drying of the pressure sensitis adhesive coating, the resultant tape was slit and wound into rolls 2.54 cm wide. Peel adhesions determined according to ASTM D 1000 except for application and testing temperatures were Applied at 200C, tested at 200C 340 gf cm Applied at 1150C, tested at 200C 1248 gf cm Applied at 1150C, tested at 650C 817 gf cm Example 19 Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate polyester film 25 micrometers in thickness was heat treat to develop superior thermal dimensional stability. Silvf stripes were vapor deposited 0.89 mm wide and approximatE 100 nm thick. Into a solution of the adhesive of Example 3 wc mixed per 100 parts adhesive solids 8 parts by volume of flattened silver particles, 76 micrometers to 102 micrometers in diameter and approximately 25 micrometers thick. While being stirred vigorously, this was coated onto the silvered side of the polyester film to a dried thickness of approximately 25 micrometers. A piece of the resulting hot tackifying adhesive tape 3.1 cm in length was bonded at one end to a conducts indium tin oxide coating on glass and at the other end te printed circuit board as in Example 16 except at 11.9 kg cm2 . The board had electrically conductive channels the same spacing as the vapor coated stripes of the tape that each adhesive stripe connected one channel to the indium tin oxide coating through 2.54 cm of unbonded tapInitial resistance per channel through the two adhesives bonds was 255 ohms at room temperature. After 431 hours 900C, the resistance at room temperature was 437 ohms. Example 20 Used in this Example was a carrier web having low adhesion surfaces, one having greater affinity to acrylate adhesives than the other. The adhesive composition of Example 1 was coated over the surface of greater affinity and dried and cured 2 minutes at 500C, 2 minutes at 800C and 4 minutes at 950C. After cooling, this hot tackifying adhesive tape was slit to widths of 1.27 cm and wound up for storage. The adhesive layer was transferred to dead soft rolled copper foil 305 g m2 by rolling from the carrier side at 1150C. The resulting copper foil backed tape was tested as follows Probe Tack Value at 600C 225 gf 650 Shear Value 1100 minutes 900 Static Peel Value One half inch by 3 inch 1.27 by 7.62 cm test specimens are bonded in a heated platen press by their adhesive layers to glass plates, leaving one inch 2.54 cm of each specimen unbonded. The platens are heated to 2000C, and 200 psi 1378 kPa is applied for ten seconds.The actual temperature to which the adhesive is heated may be 40 or 500C below the platen temperature. The glass plates are immediately positioned horizontally in a test fixture, a 100 gram weight is hung from the unbonded portion of the specimen, and the fixture is placed in a humidity chamber at 800C and 95 R.H. The time for the weight to fall is recorded as the 900 Static Peel Value.All exported values are averages of at least three specimens. 1800 Dynamic Peel Value Specimens prepared in the same manner as for the 900 Static Peel Value are tested for 1800 peelback on aTwing Albert tensile tester intellect 500 at a jaw separation rate of 0.1 inch min C0.2S cm min .

Examples 25 28 were not tested. Example 31 A hot tackifying tape of the invention was made using as the backing biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film of 25 micrometers thickness which had been heat treated to develop superior thermal dimensional stability. Metallic silver stripes were applied by vapor deposition to a thickness of 25 nm and a width of 0.89 mm on 1.78 mm centers. The solution of Acrylic silane Interpolymer A wa diluted with ethyl acetate to a coatable viscosity and the mixed with flattened silver metal particles having diameters from 76 to 102 micrometers and thicknesses about 25 micrometers. The particles comprised about 8R by volume of the mixture which was coated through a mask in stripes in register with the vapor deposited silver stripes. Each adhesive stripe was about 13 micrometers in thickness after drying. Then the unfilled coatable solution of AcrylicCopolymer A was coated uniformly over the entire striped face and dried to a thickness of about 13 micrometers.This was slit into tapes having a width of 2.54 Cm, each tape having ten silver metal stripes and matching silver particle filled adhesive stripes. The tapes were wound upon themselves into rolls. A piece of the tape 3.7 cm in length was applied to an unheated printed circuit board using a press, the moving platen of which was preheated to 1700C. Each pair of stripes of the tape matched a conductive lead on the face of the circuit board adhered length 0.6 cm . A pressure of 1340 kPa cm2 was applied for 5 seconds. The other end of the piece of tape was applied in the same way to an unheated indium tin oxide coating on glass adhered length 0.32 cm . The pressure in each case reduced the overall adhesive thickness to less than the thicknesses of the silver metal particles, thus creating an electricallyconductive path between the indium tin oxide coating and each conductor of the printed circuit. After cooling to room temperature, the average resistance in, each such path was 50 ohms.After 1000 hours at 90 C, the resistance had not increased. Example 32 The solution of Acrylic silane Interpolymer B was diluted with ethyl acetate to 15.5 solids. Then 1.9 part of disalicylalpropylene diamine and 2.3 parts of antioxidant per 100 parts of adhesive solids were added. This was coated onto dead soft rolled copper foil 305 g m2 , dried, and interleafed with a carrier web having low adhesion surfaces. The carrier web was peeled off and substituted by a similar carrier web which was held in a taut condition and joined to the adhesive layer between the nip of two heated steel rolls. The roll contacting the carrier web was smooth, and the other roll had an embossing pattern consisting of 2 sets of raised fine lines on centers of 1.59 mm, the 2 sets being at right angles to each other, leaving a pattern of depressed squares on the embossing roll as illustrated in Fig. 3 of U.S. Patent No. 3,497,383 Olyphant, Jr. et al. . All the raised lines ran in a direction inclined 450 to the direction of rotation, so that diagonals of the squares were in the direction of rotation. While both rolls were at 2490C, they were pressed together with a gauge pressure of 2800 g cm2 distributed across the 25 cm wide web, thus creating fine lines in the copper foil which reached the surface of the adhesive at the carrier web. The whole was slit to a width of 2.54 cm and wound up for storage. After peeling off the carrier web, the hot tackifying adhesive layer of a piece of the resulting tape 2.5 inches 6.35 cm in length was laid against two copper foil specimens such that a one inch 2.54 cm length at each end of the tape contacted copper with a 0.5 inch 1.27 cm gap between the two copper specimens. Bonds to the copper specimens were made on a hot plate at 1210C under three passes of a hard rubber roller using full arm pressure. After cooling, the resistance between the two copper foil specimens was 0.2 ohm.
