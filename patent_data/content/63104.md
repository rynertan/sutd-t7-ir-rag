## Description
The present invention relates to a ski supporting structure. As it is well known the skiers, as they are not used, are arranged in a subvertical position, against a wall or they are inserted into a cabinet for saving space. On the other hand this arrangement, in addition to being a scarcely stable one,may cause the skies to undesirably deflect or deform. Accordingly, the task or the present invenTion is that of obviating the thereinabove mentionea drawbacks, by providing a ski supporting structure which is erfective to support the skies in a precisely vertical position. Within the scope of this task, it is a main object of the present invention to provide a ski supporting structure which is erfective to rigidly fix the skies by means or simple and quick manual operations. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a ski supporting structure comprising means for rtrmly holding the ski sticks. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a ski supporting structure which is of reduced size and easy to be applied to a wall, at the aesired height thereon. According to one aspect oI the present invention the above task and obects,as well yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter are achieved by a ski supporting structure,characterized in that it comprises a substantially box like body, consisting or two flat parallel walls,provided with a respective edge member ana horizontally extending,saia two flat walls being coupled by a dihedral rront wall,provideu with different area tacts the upper thereof, or greater area, is provided with vertically extending slots effective to slidingly hold a shaped rod , the latter being pivoted to the upper wall of said horizontally extending walls and being biassed, in the inside or saia box like body, by elastic biassing means, the free end or said shaped rod being effective to edge affix a ski pair to said box like body. Advantageously the box like bony is attached to a vertical wall by means of a dihedral member, as preliminarly affixed to the wall and being provided with folded edges effective to resiliently hold the edges or the box like body. Moreover the two horizontal walls or the box like body have a like depth, thereby they are effective to hold the skies in a precise vertical attitude. Purther characteristics and advantages or the ski supporting structure according to the present invention will become more apparent rrom the following detailed description or a preYerrea embodiment thereof, with rererence to the accompanying drawings, wnere fig.l is a perspective view illustrating the ski supporting structure according to the present invention,removed from the diehdral member for fixing the supporting structure to a wall fig.2 is a cross sectional view of the box like body fig.3 is a vertical cross section view of the diehdral fixing member ana fig.4 is a vertical cross section view or the subject ski supporting structure, With reference to the numbers or the figures ol the accompanying drawings, the ski supporting structure according to the present invention comprises a substantially box like body I, consisting or two flat parallel walls 2 and 3, provided with respective small edge members 2 and 3 and coupled to a front diehdral wall 4, in the upper portion whereof there are formed vertically extending slots 5, suitably spaced from one another. Along the slots shaped rods 6 are able or sliding, being pivoted,at one end thereoz,7,in the inside or the upper wall 2 or the aforesaid box like body. More specifically, on the portions or said rods 6 inside the box like body, there are engaged pressure springs 8,each spring being stopped against the respective slot 5 by a plate 9. The shaped rod 6 has the free end thereof indicated at 10, doubly folded and being provided with a side hook member 11. The box like body 1 is attached to a wall 12 preferably by means of a diehdral member 13, the latter being provided with lower and upper edge members, indicated at 14 and 15 respectively, the edge upper member 15 being or greater extension and doubly folded. In particular the upper edge member 15 is provided with cut away portions 16,formed at the portions provided for housing the pins or the rods 6. In the practice,upon having attached to the wall 12 the diehdral member,on the latter there is engaged,firstly from the bottom and then, by means or a suitable pressure from the top, the box like body 1 which, because or the biassing or the edge members 14 and 15,remains in turn attached to the wall 12. It should be pointed out in this connection that the aforesaid diehdral member 13 is made of a suitably elastic material therebygby varying the angle thereof, by means of a suitable pressure anu using small blocks 17, against the wall fig.4 it is possible to modify the attitude or the edges thereof, in order to provide a sure affixing on the box like member lo The latter, after being mounted on the diehZl member, will be laterally closed by means of two .edged small walls 16 erfective to be located above the walls of said box like body. It should also be noted that the box like body 1 is provided at the top thereor with two circular openings 22, closed by a plug member,and effective to allow for the user to engage with his fingers the inside of the box like body 1 to remove the latter from the diehdral member 13. he operation of the disclosed structure is self evidentsmore specifically, by upwardly rotat ing one of the rods 6 the sky pair is inserted between the end 10 of the rod and the box like body 1. The engagement provided by the end 10, owing to the presence or the spring bswill be sufficient to support the ski pair. Then the user will engage the ski sticks 20 on the hook member ll which latter is also effective to facilitate the upwardly rotation of the rod 6, as the ski pair is to be removed. Obviously suitable protecting liners 21 will be applied on the ski contacting portions0 From the above disclosure and the figures or the accompanying drawings the great functionality ana use facility characterizing the ski supporting structure according to the present invention will be self evident.
