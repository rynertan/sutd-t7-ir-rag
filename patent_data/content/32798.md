# FLUID BED COMBUSTOR AND PROCESS OF PRODUCING A NON AGGLOMERATING VANADIUM COATED PARTICLE

## Abstract
A vertical tube fluidized bed boiler having a horizontal dis tributor plate is disclosed where the tubes are distributed sub stantially over the entire surface of the plate. The plate is con structed of novel tiles or sections that fit around the base of the tubes and which allow for the easy assembly and repair or replacement of the tube array. The disclosure also relates to a process for the produc tion of non agglomerating vanadium coated particles compris ing the combustion of a carbonaceous material or fuel contain ing relatively large amounts of vanadium in the presence of an oxidizing gas and a particulate substrate such as sand. A fluid ized bed reactor is preferably used to carry out the process.
