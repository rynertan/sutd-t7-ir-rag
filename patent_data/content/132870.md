# Radiation sensitive semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A radiation sensitive semiconductor device, more in par ticular a line imager, wherein a plurality of closely spaced photodiodes 10 are electrically insulated from each other by depleted regions. The device is provided with storage means 18, 19 for collecting the minority charge generated in each diode during a certain integration time and transfer means 12, 13 for transferring the distinct charge carrier packets to read out means 15 , whereby improved performance with respect to blooming between adjacent diodes is obtained.
