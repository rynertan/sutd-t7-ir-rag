## Description
ALKOXYCARBONILATION OR CARBONYLATIONWITH CO AND ORGANIC HYDROXYL COMPOUND This invention relates to a new reaction wherein enol acylate is reacted with CO and a hydroxyl compound add an eseerified carboy group to the vinyl enol carbon atom of the enol acylate. The enol acylate may vinyl acetate in a now preferred embodiment of the process, and the esterified product can be hydrolyzed produce lactic acid. More specifically, according to the present invention we provide a process comprising intimately admixing and reacting an enol acylate,EMI1.1 wlth CO and a hydroxyl compoundEMI1.2 which is free of ethylenic or acetylenic unsaturation to produce an acyloxy ester compound,EMI1.3 or a a hydroxy ester compound,EMI1.4 or both wherein each R is H or C1 to C30 hydrocarbyl, usually H or C1 to C10 hvdrocarbyl, and each R is the same or different, and L, L and L are each H or an organic radical andL and L can be members of a ring toqether with C, and x either is zero or 1 as necessary to satisfy the valence of the carbon atom, and wherein each of L, L , L and said Acyl radicals can contain up to 30, usually up to 10, carbon atcms. Most usually each R group is limited to a maximum of 10 carbon atoms, all of which are members of an open chain hydrocarbyl qroup. In a more particular aspect of the invention the enol acylate reactant is a vinyl acylate, H2C CHOAcyl, the foreqoinq enol acylate where all R s are H and compounds A and B become respectively, compounds C and D EMI2.1 In all of the above L, L and L and the residue of the Acyl attached to the Acyl 0 ato.m are usually hydrocarbyl. Moreover, the enol acylate is always free of acetylenic unsaturation and contains only one ethylenic double bond. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a two step process in which the product A and or B includinq C and or D is hydrolyzed to the alpha hydroxy acid EMI2.2 The process of the present invention when applied to a vinyl acylate reactant is of special importance since compounds C and D are precursors of lactic acid, compound F , important commercially in the bakinq industry, in the cheese industry, in dyinq wool, in alkyd resins, to make plasticizers for resins, etc.It is particularly applicable when the vinyl acylate is vinyl acetate, since the latter raw material is inexpensive and readily available. This embodiment of the invention, the last mentioned aspect, is especially important since lactic acid has heretofore been made by relatively disadvantaqeous processes. Thus, lactic acid is currently produced either by fermentation, usually of molasses, or by a multistep non catalytic route involvinq HCN hydrocyanation of acetaldehyde followed by hydrolysis of the product cyanohydrin with H2SO4 to yield a stoichiometric amount of NH4 2SO4 alonq with lactic acid. The fermentation process is costly and inefficient in that it produces large amounts of by products, making product purification expensive and troublesome. The chemical route is hiqhly corrosive, consumes stoichiometric amounts of toxic HCN and H2SO4, is expensive, based on HCN prices, andProduces stoichiometric quantities of ammonium sulfate, a low qrade fertilizer difficult to sell at a profit. It is an obiect of the present invention to provide a process for making compounds of the formula A or B , precursors for 2 hydroxycarboxylic acids, includinq compounds of formulas C and D , precursors for lactic acid, by an economically advantaqeous route. It is another obiect of the invention to Provide such a process for making lactic acid Precursors, and for making lactic acid therefrom by hydrolysis, which avoids the disadvantaqes of the foreqoinq conventional processes. Other objects, as well as aspects, features, and advantages o the present invention will become apparent from the description, examples and claims herein. The foregoing objects are realized according to the process of the present inventions, which process utilizes inexpensive CO to replace HCN as the carbon source and is capable of producing the esters of compounds A and B in high yields at hiah conversions and selectivities.Furthermore, the present process results in essentially no non recyclable or other undesirable hy products.Note that compounds s , B C and D are hydrolyzable to the 2 hydroxy carboxylic acid, lactic acid in the case of C and D . We believe that we are the first to discover or disclose the carbonylation or carboxylation reaction of an enol acylate with a CO and a hydroxyl compound such as an alcohol or the like. Thus, in U.S. Patent 4,257,973 there is disclosed in column 2 the alkoxycarbonylation of certain acyloxyolefinic compounds in which the acyloxy group is attached to a carbon atom which is part of a hydrocarbyl group which is in turn attached to a carbon atom of an ethylenic double bond. A similar structure is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,859,319. However, neither patent discloses the reaction of the alkoxycarbonylation of an enol acylate with C and a hydroxyl compound, although each prior art patent discloses this type of reaction with a very wide variety of aliphatically unsaturated compounds, using particular organophosphorus palladium halides as catalysts. U.S. Patent 4,377,708 discloses the hydrocarboxylation of enol esters such as vinyl acetate and other vinyl esters using CO and pater as reactants with the enol esters. Special prezautions are taken to provide for stability of catalyst, product and starting material in the presence of thever reactant, and care must be taken to provide for the presence of only a small fraction of the water required for the reaction thus usually the water is kept at a concentration of no more than about 3 weight percent of the reaction medium, so as to avoid hydrolysis of the ester starting material such as vinyl acetate to form an enol and a carboxylic acid, which enol can be and will rearrange to an aldehyde. The present prccess avoids the problem of hydrolysis with water. Furthermore, as will be seen, much higher yields can be produced in the present process the bestir U.S. 4,377,708 being 76 percent selectivity at 98 percent conversion, amounting to about 74.5 percent yield, well below the yield of products hydro wzale to lactic acid that can be made in the present process. German patent 1,221,224 discloses carboxylation with ro and alcohols or phenols. The substrates disclosed are olefinic compounds but do not include any enol acylates. wiss patent 589,571 is similar and also does not disclose ny enol aeylate starting material. Enol acylates are potentially subject to the probability or possibility of instability in a reaction involving an alcohol or the like because some transesterification could take place to make an enol, which is unstable and would decompose to a saturated aldehyde. o such problem exists in the alkylcarboxylation of olefinic materials such as allyl acetate or methyl acrylate because no enols are potentially involved. The hydrocarboxylation reaction is carried out catalytically, discussed in more detail hereafter. It can also be carried out continuously or in batch operation in the liquid or vapor phases. Usually the reaction is carried out in batch operation in a solvent under pressure. The reactant concentrations can vary widely and are not critical. The ratio of hydroxy reactant to the enol ester is usually no greater than 10 1 on a molar basks. The amount of monoxide can vary widely, but it is preferred to carry out the reaction under a carbon monoxide pressure of 15 to 3500 psig, preferably 500to 2500 psig. The amount of catalyst can also vary widely. Most conveniently, the amount of catalyst is between 0.01 and 100 mole percent based on the enol ester, more usually 0.1 to 10 mole percent. Usually, the reactant is carried out with a solvent.The solvent should be inert under the reaction conditions and should dissolve the reactants and desirably dissolve the active catalyst species, although heterogenous catalysts are possible. Suitable solvents are tetrahydrofuran, benzene, CH3CN1 diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, CH2C12 and CH3C1. The now preferred solvent is tetrahydrofuran, particularly when using 3P 2PdC12 or Pd P3 4 catalyst, or other palladium compounds, although an excess of the hydroxyl compound is also especially usefull. usually, the amount of solvent in the system will be such that the enol ester concentration is at least about 0.01 weight percent in the solution.A special case of a solvent that is not inert, strictly speaking, under the reaction conditions is either of the starting material reactants, i.e., the enol ester or the hydroxy compound.Either can be used in excess of the stoichiometric amount to react with the other reactant. Use of a large excess of the compoundEMI6.1 whether or not another solvent, such as THF, is present, helps produce appreciable amounts of compound B thus, the Acyl group is transesterified during the main carboxylation step. The reaction is normally carried out at a temperature of 0 to 2500C, preferably 20 to 1500C. However, the reaction temperature can be below or above this if desired.As will be understood, optimum reaction temperature varies with the specific reactants. Reaction times on the order of 0.1 to 250 hours can be employed, with reaction times on the order of 2 to 50 hours being more convenient. While a wide variety of complexes of transition metals are known as catalysts for the hydrocarboxylation of alkenes See, for instance, 1 Pino, P., Piacenti, F., in Organic Synthesis via Metal Carbonyls, Volume 2, Wender,I., Pino, P., eds., Wiley, New York, 1977, pp. 233 296 2 Falbe, J., New Synthesis with Carbon Monoxyde, NewYork, Springer Verlag, Chapter 3 and 5 3 Forster, D., Hershman, A., Morris, D.E., Catal. Rev. Sci. En. 23, 89 105 1981 4 Parshall, G.W., Catal. Rev. Sci. Eng., 23, 107 124 1981 5 Bitter, J, V. Kutepow, N., Neubauer, D., Reis,H., Anger Chem. Intl. Ed. Eng. 7, 329 335 1968 , no disclosures were found using such catalysts to react an enol acylate with CO and an organic hydroxyl compound.Catalysts useful are generally transition metal compounds, particularly coordination complexes of such metals. e have discovered that palladium coordination complexes are remarkably effective, and especially those complexed with a phosphine, such as P3, when considered in the light of experience with other known transition metal catalyst complexes for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes, or for hydroformylation for enol ethers or enol acetates U.S. Patent 3,888,880 B.Fell, M.Barl, J. Mol. Catal., 1977, 2, 301 6 Tinker, Harold B. Monsanto Ger. Offen. 2,623,673 U.S.4,072,709 . Especially useful Pd complexes are 03P 2PdC12 and 3P 4Pd with or without a promoter or co catalyst such as HC1 or P 3. Once a reaction is completed, the ester products can be recovered from the reaction system in a conventional manner, such as for example, by vacuum distillation. Especially useful hydroxyl compounds in the reaction with the enol acylates and CO are hydroxyalkanes having C1 to C4 carbon atoms, and phenol. The second step in the overall process of the invention is the hydrolysis of the esters A and or B to the alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid in the special case of the ester products C and D . This reaction is a conventional hydrolysis reaction. It is catalyzed by any dilute aqueous acid or base. Suitable acids or bases are HC1, H2S04, HNO3, HPO4, acetic acid, KOH, NaOH, NH40H or pyridine. The reaction is conveniently carried out at temperatures at above 0 C to 1200C, more usually about 20 to 100 C. If desired, non interfering hydrophilic solvents other than water can be employed. Examples of such solvents are tetrahnTdrofuran, CH3CN, and the like. Reaction times on the order of 0.1 to 24 hours, usually 0.5 to 4 hours, can be employed. An alternate method of carrying out the hydrolysis of compounds A or B is to treat A or B with H20 tithe gas phase temperature 100 2500C with or without catalyst. The 2 hydroxy acid product of the hydrolysis can be recovered from the reaction nedium in a conventional manner.For example, the reaction product can be recovered by precipitation as the calcium salt. Alternatively, low boiling by product components of the hydrolysis product mixture can be removed by fractional distiliation, and the remaining lactic acid or other 2 hydroxy acid sthution in water can be sold as end product If the 2 hydroxy acid is produced Ly the gas phase reaction described above, it can be isolated in pure form from the reaction effectuent by fractional distillation and stored either as pure compound or in aqueous solution It will be noted that, as understood in the art, aqueous solutions of lactic acid more concentrated than 20 percent will tend to polymnrizeD The above reaction scheme comprising reactions 1 to 3 provides a simple and straightforward system for producing 2 hydroxy acids using an enol acylate starting material. As can be seen, it totally avoids the use of costly and deleterious HCN and the production of unwanted by product ammonium sulfate, with the consumption of large amounts of sulfuric acid.

The bomb was sealed and carbon monoxide at a pressure of 1000 psi room temperature was charged to the bomb, and the bomb was heated to 100 C and allowed to react for 44 hours with stirring. At the termination of the reaction the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography and it was found that no methyl 2 acetyloxypropanoate or methyl 2 hydroxypropanoate was produced. EXAMPLE 15 0.530 mmoles es. acetate and 2.70 mmoles methanol were charged into a 71 cc stainless steel bomb equipped with a glass liner and a Teflon coated stir bar. One mole percent, based on vinyl acetate of HC1 was added 0.05 mmoles toluene was included at an internal standard.Five milliliters of tetrahydrofuran as a solvent were also included in the reaction system. The reaction mixture was charged under argon. The bomb was sealed and carbon monoxide at a pressure of 1000 psi at room temperature was charged to the bomb, and the bomb was heated to 1000C and allowed to react for 44 hours with stirring. At the termination of the reaction, the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography an it was found that no methyl 2 acetyloxypropanoate or methyl 2 hydroxypropanoate was produced. EXAMPLE 16 1.2 grams of methyl 2 acetyloxypropanoate was hydrolyzed to lactic acid by adding it with stirring to 15mL of 2N aqueous HC1 solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and CaOH3 was added slowly and carefully in small portions with stirring until the product solution was neutral to pH paper. Water was removed at high vacuum, and the white solid product was shown byNMR spectroscopy to contain 0.74g of calcium lactate 84 yield . EXAMPLE 17 1.0 gEMI16.1 9.6 mmol was hydrolyzed to lactic acid by adding it with stirring to 20mL of 2N aqueous HC1 lution The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and CaCO3 was added slowly and carefully in small portions th strig until the product solution was neutral to p paper. Water was removed at high vacuum, and the white solid product was chown by NMR spectroscopy to contain 1.03g of calcium lactate 98.3 yield . As will be evident to those skilled in the art various modifications of this invention can be made or followed in the light of the foregoing disclosure and discussion without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure or from the scope of the claims.
