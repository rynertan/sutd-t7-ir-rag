# Processes for measuring quantities of gases and for delivering predetermined amounts of liquids and apparatuses to carry out these processes.

## Abstract
A process for measuring quantities of gases and for delivering predetermined amounts of liquids, using an arrangement of interconnected liquid containing vessels 2, 3, 5 and control means 6, 7 , in which a gas is introduced into one 2 of the vessels 2, 3, 5 , which makes the liquid rise in another vessel the measuring pipette 5 to a predetermined level 6 , on which an amount of liquid flows from the system until a predetermined lower level 7 is reached, after which the liquid rises again, etc., and if desired the number of times that the measuring pipette 5 is filled and emptied is counted by a counter 21 . An apparatus for carrying out the process is also described.
