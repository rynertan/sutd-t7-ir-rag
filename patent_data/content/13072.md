## Description
Long Chain Amine Derivatives THIS INVENTION relates to alkoxylated amines, to compositions based on these amines and to the manufacl and use of these amines and compositions. Compositions based on long chain amines and their derivatives have been proposed for a wide variety of uses7 for example as fabric softening agents and as emulsifiers. However, such prior art compositions have not always been entirely satisfactory, for example because their degree of effectiveness is less than might be desired or because they are difficult to handle. We have now surprisingly found that certain long chain amine derivatives and compositions based on them have some advantageous properties and a wide variety of uses. Accordingly, the present invention comprises alkoxylated amine compounds having the formula EMI1.1 where R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen and alkyl groups containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms, with the proviso that R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen, and where R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen or lower alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. R3 and R4 are preferably hydrogen or methyl groups. In a preferred embodiment of this invention the substituents R1 and R2 are both long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 70 , and R3 and R4 are both hydrogen. More preferably, the substituents R1 and R2 comprise long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms comprising approximately 65 to 7596 C13 groups with approximately 35 to 2546 C15 groups these percentages being calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups with approximately 40 to 55 wt 46 straight chain and 60 to 4546 2 alkyl branched chain where the 2 alkyl group is predominantly methyl.The derivative of this preferred embodiment is hereinafter referred to as Synprolam Registered Trade Mark D35X1. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, one of the substituents R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is selected from long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 7046, and R3 and R4 are both hydrogen.More preferably, the substituent R1 or R2 which is not hydrogen comprises long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms comprising approximately 65 to 75, C13 groups with approximately 35 to 2596 C15 groups these perntages being calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups with approximately 40 to 55 wt , straight chain and 60 to 45, 2 alkyl branched chain where the 2 alkyl group is predominantly methyl. The derivative of this preferred embodiment is hereinafter referred to as Synprolam Registered Trade Mark 35X1. Alkoxylated amine compounds according to this invention are conveniently prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde of formulaEMI2.1 and a monoalkanolamine NH2 . CR3R4 2. OH where R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings hereinbefore described, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example a nickel catalyst, for example Rane, nickel. HowelTer, the use of other hydrogenation catalysts in the process of this invention is not ruled outs Some alkoxylated amine compounds according to this invention for example Synprolam D35X1 are conveniently prepared by normal amine alkoxylation, for example ethoxylation methods but compounds in which one ci R1 and R2 is hydrogen, for example Synprolam 3fXl cannot be obtained so readily or in a suitably pure condition by such methods because of the difficulty of ensuring that only one mole of alkylene oxide reacts with the amine. The products of this invention have a wide variety of uses for example as emulsifiers, anticaking agents, flotation agents, corrosion inhibitors, antistatic agents and also for example as chemical intermediates leading to other useful chemical compounds. The compounds of this invention, their manufacture and use are further illustrated in the following Examples.EXAMPLE 1Manufacture of Synprolam 35X1 Nonoethanolamine 122g , Raney nickel catalyst 45g and methanol 340g were heated in an autoclave to 110 C under 435psig 30.58 Kg cm2g hydrogen pressure.To this mixture a mixture of C13 and C15 aldehydes 416g was added over 2 hours and the mixture was stirred at 1100C and 435psig 30.58 Kg cm2g pressure for a further 30 minutes. The mixture of C13 and C15 aldehydes had the composition all parts by weight Hydrocarbons 1.0 C11 aldehydes 1.4 C13 aldehydes 66.5 C15 aldehydes 31.2, Unidentified heavy ends 1.9 After cooling, the product was filtered and the methanol removed by evaporation at reduced pressure. The final product SlOg , Synprolam 35X1, contained 83, of N C13 to C15 alkyl , N 2 hydroxy ethyl amine.EXAMPLE 2Use of Svnprolam 35X1 as a bitumen adhesion agentThe final product obtained in Example 1 was added to bitumen at a level in the range 0.05 to 2.5 by weight to improve the adhesion between the bitumen and an aggregate used in the road making industry. lOOg of 200 penetration low acid value bitumen was heated to 800C. To this was added 1.8g of the final product from Example 1 2 Synprolam 35X1 and the mixture was stirred for five minutes. A further 200g of the bitumen previously heated to 800C was added and the mixture stirred for a further 10 minutes. The treated bitumen 230g was passed into a 250ml conical flask and lightly stoppered. The flask and its contents were then heated at 1350C for 5 days. The adhesion of the thus treated bitumen to road aggregate was tested in a tray test as follows. The heat treated bitumen 20g was placed in a 5 diameter clean tin lid to an overall depth of 1.5mm and then allowed to stand for 30 minutes on a level surface at 20 to 250C. The lid and bitumen were then immersed to a depth of 2.5 cm in demineralised water at 25 C. Ten selected clean granite chippings from theMountsorrel quarry, Leicestershire were lightly pressed into the bitumen surface and left in contact for 5 minutes. The chippings were then turned over. The percentage of bitumen retained on the chippings was assessed visually at 30, . In comparative tests, it was found that the chippings retained no bitumen when no additive was used.When the same quantity of N tallow alkyl 1,3 propylene diamine was used in place of the Synprolam 35X1 the percentage of bitumen retained was assessed at 20 . EXAMPLE 3Manufacture of Synarolam D35X1 Monoethanolamine 91.6g , Raney nickel catalyst 23g and methanol 450g were heated to 1100C in an autoclave under 435psig 30.58 Kg cm2g hydrogen pressure. To this mixture was added over 2 hours 624g of the mixture of C13 and C15 aldehydes used in Example 1 and the mixture was stirred at 110C and 435psig 30.58 Kg cm2g pressure for a further 30 minutes. After cooling, the product was filtered and the methanol removed by evaporation at reduced pressure to give a final product, Synprolam D35X1, containing 52 of N,N di C13 to C15 alkyl N 2 hydroxyethy1 amine.
