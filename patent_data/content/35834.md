# Corrosion inhibitors and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Corrosion inhibitors for aqueous media comprise a triazole, an alkali metal borate, benzoate, and silicate and an alkali metal salt of a C₇ to C₁₃ dibasic acid. They may be used in antifreeze compositions for motor vehicles. Since neither nit rites and amines are required the danger of forming toxic nitrosamines by the reaction of these materials is overcome.
