# PHENOLIC FOAMS

## Abstract
A cured substantially closed cell phenolic resin foam is made by preparing a mixture of a foamable phenol aldehyde resin, water, a blowing agent, an acid catalyst, a surfactant, and a solvent comprising a lactone, allowing the mixture to foam, and curing the phenolic foam. For best results the water content of the foamable mixture is maintained below about 14 by weight, the acid catalyst is resin soluble, and the amount of surfactant is at least 2 phr.
