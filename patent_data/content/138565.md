# NAILING MACHINE

## Abstract
A heel nailing machine has a plurality of feed tubes 14 to 24 through which nails can be fed one by one from a nail sepa rating station 12 to a receiving block 26 for transfer by a so called nail loader 40 to a nailing station 36 . Each tube has a nail sensor 46 for optically sensing the passage of nails therealong. Each sensor 46 generates a signal in response to the passage of a nail and this signal illuminates one of an array of lights 108 to 118 to indicate the presence of a nail. In the event that no nail is present at any one location the light asso ciated therewith is not illuminated and in addition an alarm 122, 124 is operated. For enabling the sensing means to operate in different environments compensating means 66, 67 is provided for compensating changes in sensitivity of each sensor 46 .
