# Coil package.

## Abstract
A readily stackable coil package comprises a closed carton 1 which is formed from a folded cardboard blank and which has a pair of oppositely disposed major side walls 2 whose boundary edges 4 lie in parallel planes. Each major side wall 2 has an area 5 of weakness in axial alignment with an area of weakenss in the other major side wall. A coil of wire is housed in the closed carton 1 and, also loosely housed in the closed carton, is separately formed means 7 for forming a rigid hollow hub. When it is desired to convert the closed carton 1 into a reel, the areas 5 of weakness are removed to form apertures, the separately formed hub forming means 7 is extracted from the package and is assembled to form a rigid hollow hub extending between and secured to parts of the major side walls bounding the apertures in the major side walls.
