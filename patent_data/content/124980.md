# Inverted microscope.

## Abstract
A microscope 10 is arranged so that the light from the object under study is directed down through an objective lens 16 and then to a video camera 18 . None of it is diverted to an eye piece or the like. The image can be viexed on a video monitor. There is no clutter of optical equipment above the object, and there need be only enough light to operate the camera.
