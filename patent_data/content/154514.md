# Method of heating thermal head of thermal printer.

## Abstract
In a thermal printer which conducts recording by heating the heat generating elements 11 with the drive signal, the present invention is characterized in that temperature of heat generating elements, after passage of specified period from said thermal recording signal application start timing, can be kept constant, by applying predetermined auxiliary pulse corresponding to generated temperature during the thermal recording in the cooling process after application of thermal recording signal corresponding to the tone to be recorded.
