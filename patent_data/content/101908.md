# A replaceable bobbin for a cassette cleaner unit.

## Abstract
A disposable bobbin 5 for a cassette cleaner unit includes a filament spool 25 which holds a cleaning filament 6 that is prewetted with a cleaning fluid. The bobbin 5 is packaged in an impermeable pouch 40 which prevents evaporation of the cleaning fluid until its use in a video cassette player. The bobbin 5 may be used in either Beta or VHS cassette cleaner units.
