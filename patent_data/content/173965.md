# Power control device for disk apparatus.

## Abstract
A power control device for a disk apparatus has first and second flip flops 41, 43 respectively constituted by mono stable multivibrators for latching STEP and MOTORON signals supplied from a floppy disk controller 3 during execution of a seek instruction of a main processor 1 . An output from the second flip flop 43 is disabled before the STEP signal is supplied thereto. A period of time T2 for which a final STEP signal is supplied to the second flip flop 43 and then the output from the first flip flop 41 is disabled is longer than a pulse width of the STEP signal. Q outputs from the first and second flip flops 41, 43 are supplied to first and second transistors Q1, Q2 through a NOR gate 45 . Collector outputs of the first and second transistors Q1, Q2 are supplied to the bases of third and fourth transistors Q3, Q4 whose emitters respectively receive voltages of 12 V and 5 V. An output from the NOR gate 45 is kept low for a predetermined period of time until the rush current is eliminated after the spindle motor 17 is started, and for a predetermined period of time after the step pulse is supplied to drive the stepping motor 13 . The first and second transistors Q1, Q2 are kept off and then the third and fourth transistors Q3, Q4 are also kept off. Power supply voltages of 12 V and 5 V are not supplied to a read write amp 11 .
