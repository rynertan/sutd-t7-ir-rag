# Method and apparatus for testing electrical interconnection networks.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for testing circuit boards using two or a small number of probes for making resistive and radio frequence impedance measurements, e.g., capacitive measurements. The combination of resistive and im pedance measurements substantially reduces the number of tests required to verify the integrity of a circuit board. The impedance of capacitive norm values used in testing the circuit boards can be obtained by operating the system in a learning mode. Analysis of the data provides not only fault detection but can also indicate approximate fault location.
