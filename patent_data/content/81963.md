# Self adhesive labels.

## Abstract
The invention discloses the manufacture of self adhesive labels in roll form, without a backing strip The base web material is non fibrous and is substantially inextensible, and it is coated on one side with release material such as a polymerisable silicone resin, and on the other side with pressure sensitive adhesive. The web is die cut to define labels therein which can be removed from the remainder of the web and applied directly to products at an application station by a method and means forming part of the invention. The die cutting may be carried out prior to the application of the release coating, or subsequently, including immediately before the application station. The invention also includes a method of making the labels using relatively small dimensioned curing and or drying ovens for the release coating and adhesive, and also release coaters and adhesive applicators.
