## Description
Electrochemical Cell for Determining a Particular Component of a FluidThe invention relates to an electrochemical cell in accordance with the general portion of claim 1. Cells of this type are for instance used for determining the oxygen content of a fluid such a blood or air. A wellknown type of this cell is the so called Clark Cell as described in US A 29 13 386. For medical and biological applications a miniaturized cell of this type has been proposed in EP A application 82 108 135.3 , wherein a thin layer of hydrophylic polymer is provided between a non porous membrane and the electrodes and covers at least the cathode. The membrane has at least one hole in it for allowing an electrolytic component of the fluid to enter said hydrophylic polymer layer, whereat the electrolyte is supplied by the fluid under measurement.It is the main object of the present invention to provide an electrochemical cell of the above mentioned type having a very short response time such that it can be used for the measurement of quickly changing components in a fluid such as the oxygen content or oxygen partial pressure during respiration.Also this new cell should be capable of being miniaturized and should be suitable for medical and biological applications, i.e. sterilization should be no problem. These objects and further improvements are accomplished by the invention as characterized in claim 1. Preferred embodiments and improvements are described in the sub claims. The invention will be discribed in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 shows an electrochemical cell for measuring the oxygen partial pressure in a gaseous fluid, e.g. in the respiration air, Fig. 2 shows at an enlarged scale a top view on the sensor chip Fig.3 is a sectional view of the cell provided in a catheter and Fig.4 is a cross sectional view taken along line IV IV of Fig.3In Fig. 1 a tube like housing 1 made of metal, glass, plastic or preferrably made of ceramics is supported by an adaptor base plate 2, by means of which the sensor can be attached to a thermostatically controlled part 3 of the mouthpiece of a respiration system. A heating coil 27 surrounds these sensor portion of housing 1 when inserted into part 3. A temperature controller not shown accomplished a uniform temperature of the sensor portion during measurement.Housing 1 forms an electrolyte compartment 4 which is closed at the rearward end by means of a plate 5 having a filling opening 6, which after filling is closed by a plug 7 or otherwise.A supporting structure 8 of semicircular cross section is provided in the front end opening of housing 1 and supports a semiconductor substrate 9 forming the active portion of the sensor. The remaining area of the front end surface of housing 1 is closed by a plate 10.Substrate 9 carries a cathode layer 20 deposited on substrate 9 by the well known technology of printed circuits, thin film or thick film procedures. The cathode portion 20 and part of the substrate 9 are covered by a layer 12 consisting of a hydrophylic matrix polymer or hydrogel. A selectively permable membrane 13 covers layer 12, whereat inside housing 1 a portion 14 of layer 12 is not covered by the membrane and is directly exposed to the electrolyte in compartment 4. Substrate 9 may also carry an integrated temperature sensor 15 see Fig.2 and if required, a heater not shown which in a similar manner like the cathode layer can be deposited by thin film or thick film technology. Preferably the heater 27 is located in part 3.Electrical connectors 16 are provided on the substrate for connecting the cathode, the anode, the temperature sensor and the heater to an external measuring and supply circuit by means of a cable 17 and connector pins 18. The contact area 16 is covered and electrically insulated by a protective layer 19 consisting of silicone rubber or any other suitable material.The cathode 20 might be provided as a thin layer between two anode layers 11 on substrate 9 see Fig.2. The anode can also be formed by a separate anode lia projecting into the electrolyte compartment 4 see Fig.1 .The hydrophylic matrix polymer layer 12 by its capillary action forms a salt bridge between the electrolyte compartment 4 and the cathode layer 20.Membrane 13 which limits the diffusion of gas to the cathode area of substrate 9 can be produced by a combination of centrifugal spinning technique and lithography which is well known in the field of thin film technology. By this technology extremely thin membranes can be made in the order of less than 1 which leads to a very fast response of the sensor.Other depositing techniques suitable for producing the membrane are spraying, flow coating, silk screening, condensation out of the gas phase, grafting and sputtering. Electrolyte compartment 4 contains a sufficient amount of electrolyte for achieving a long operation time of the sensor. The temperature sensor 15 allows compensation of the temperature dependency of the sensor by means of the electrical monitoring and measuring circuitry connected to terminals 18.If a separate anode 11ais used instead of an anode 11 provided on the substrate 9 itself, the hydrophylic polymer layer 12 forms a salt bridge for the electrolyte. Substrate 9 preferrably made of a semiconducting material such as silicon may also include an integrated amplifier to overcome problems which during longterm operation may be caused by parasitic insulation currents or electrostatic effects.The sensor can be stored dry, and the electrolyte filled in shortly before the sensor will be used. The electrolyte within compartment 4 then by means of the capillary action of hydrophylic polymer layer 12 is brought to the cathode and anode area on substrate 9, therewith activating the sensor. If the sensor is used as a polarographic oxygen sensor, the oxygen surrounding the outwardly projecting portion of substrate 9 will diffuse through membrane 13 and the hydrophylic matrix polymer layer 12 to the cathode and will react at the cathode as follows O2 4H2O 4e 4OH1 The corresponding reaction at the anode can be described by 4CL 4Ag b 4ARCS 4e in case a silver anode and a chloride containing electro lyte are used.Both the chloride and the hydroxyl ions will be transported from and to the electrolyte compartment 1 via the hydrophylic matrix polymer layer 12.The use of separate anode 11a provides a longer lifetime of the sensor compared with an anode 11 provided on the substrate 9 because the amount of anode material is an essential factor for the timelife. The sensor has a small response time, in particular less than one second, and therewith can be used for monitoring quickly changing oxygen content in a gas stream.The new sensor can also be used for measuring the content of oxygen or another component of a liquid. Figures 3 and 4 show an embodiment in which the sensor is located in the tip portion of a catheter 1. The supporing structure 8 preferrably made of glass or another suitable material carries substrate 9 together with cathode layer 20, hydrophylic matrix polymer layer 12 and membrane 13. The front end portion of closed tube 1 is filled with epoxy resin or silicone rubber 21. A hole 22 provided at the circumferential wall of tube 1 allows the liquid to engage membrane 13 so that oxygen ions can diffuse through membrane 13 and polymer layer 12 to anode 11, An intermediate wall 23 closes electrolyte compartment 4 against the sensor portion of the catheter. The anode might be provided on the substrats 9 or as shown in Figure 3 may be a separate anode lla held in a supporting tube 24 within catheter 1.Cable 17 and supporting tube 24 are sealed against tube 1 by epoxy resin seals 25, therewith closing electrolyte compartment 4 at the other end.Similar sealings are provided at 26 in the area where cable 17 is connected to substrate 9. An opening provided in seal 25 allows filling compartment 4 with an electrolyte and is thereafter closed by a plug 7.This type of catheter sensor can also be used for ion selective and enzymatic sensor constructions. In these cases membrane 13 contains special organic molecules and forms a so called liquid ion membrane. Such liquid ion membrane materials can also be deposited on top of the hydrogel layer 12 by means of lithographic technology. Liquid ion membranes constitue an effective means for sensing different types of organic components of biological liquids.The use of such liquid ion membranes is described in an article Ion Selective Electrodes in Clinical Chemistry published in Medical ProgressThrough Technology 5.1 12 1977 , pages 1 10, in particular page 4.Since this kind of application involves measuring the difference of electrical potential across a high impedance membran, environmental electrical disturbance signals may influence the measuring signal which further could be decreased by insulation leakage.To overcome these problems an impedance conversion of the measuring signal is helpfull. For this purpose the silver silver chloride electrode can be connected to the input of an impedance converter, e.g. to the gate electrode if a field effect transistor, therewith converting the high impedance measuring signal to alow impedance output signal. The silver silver chloride reference electrode can be situated outside the membran at various positions, e.g. on the substrate, in the lumen of a catheter which is continously flushed with saline or in the bag or bottle containing the saline. The invention leads to a versatile sensor construction, which may be used for sensing various types of components of gaseous or liquid fluids, has a fast response, can easily be miniaturized and produced in large quantities by the well known technology of integrated circuits, lithography and thin film medods. It is not restricted to medical applications but can also be used in the field of industrial process monitoring and control, bio technology, environmental protection and for other purposes. Other components of a gaseous or liquid medium fluid than tose as described above may be monitored or searched for by the sensor.
