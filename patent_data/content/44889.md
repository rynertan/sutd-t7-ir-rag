## Description
TITLELABELS AND SHEETS THEREOF, AND METHOD OF FORMINGSUCH SHEETSTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to labels.BACKGROUND ART Some manufacturers wish to have labels attached to their products, for example to advertise special offers associated with the products. it is often preferred that the labels be easily detachable from the object. For example, the manufacturer may require that the purchaser remove the label from a product and despatch this when taking advantage of an offer as proof that he has purchased the product. The labels may be initially provided on backing sheets, each backing sheet carrying a plurality of labels detachably and adhesively attached thereto. The labels are peeled off the backing sheet before being applied to the products. The individual labels can be formed in situ on the backing sheet by severing a continuous front sheet adhesively attached to the backing sheet. It has also been proposed to provide, for different purposes, self adhesive labels having a protective backing attached to part of its adhesive rear surface see for example British Patent Specifications Nos.1,112,686 and 1,156,084 . The purpose of the backings has been to prevent objects from adhering to the covered portion of the rear surface of the label.DISCLOSURE OF INVENT ION In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided a label comprising a front portion having an adhesive rear surface, and a backing having a front surface adhesively attached to an area of the rear surface of the front portion, thereby leaving a further area of the rear surface of said front portion adherable to an object, characterised in that the backing carries information on its rear surface so that the information can be determined by detaching from the object at least a part of the front portion to which the backing is attached. The invention also extends to an object carrying such a label, and to a sheet of such labels. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a sheet of labels in which a backing sheet for carrying a plurality of front label portions having adhesive rear surfaces detachably and adhesively attached to the front surface of the backing sheet is severed or partially severed to define individual backing sheet portions, the backing sheet being severed or partially severed in such a manner that the rear surface of each front portion has an area to which a backing portion is attached and a further area by which a label formed by the front portion and the backing portion can be adhered to an object, characterised by the step of printing, either before or after the backing sheet is severed or partially severed, information which is carried on the rear surfaces of the backing portions, so that in use of a label the information carried by the backing portion can be determined by detaching from an object at least a part of the front portion to which the backing portion is attached. The method preferably further includes the step of severing or partially severing a front sheet having an adhesive rear surface detachably and adhesively attached to the front surface of the backing sheet to define individual front label portions. The rear surfaces of the backing portions of the labels provide an extra area for carrying information, for example related to special offers. This means that it is not necessary to print all the required information on the front portion of the label, thus avoiding the need for labels which are undesirably large, and or which carry undesirably small print. The rear surfaces of the backing portions could also be used by the purchaser, for example for writing thereon his name and address when despatching the label to take advantage of an offer. Another advantage arises from the fact that the rear surface of the backing sheet is not visible until the label is removed from the object. This is particularly useful when a manufacturer provides offers which are conditional upon a purchaser buying a product carrying a label having printed thereon certain information, e.g. a particular symbol. The labels can be provided with different symbols printed on the rear surfaces of the backing portions, so that a purchaser must buy a product and detach the label before he can determine which symbol is printed thereon. The rear surface of the front portion is preferably coated with an adhesive, eeg. of a non drying type, which will permit detachment of the label from the object. Such adhesives are well known in the art. However, it is possible to use instead a permanent adhesive in this case, a part of the front portion is partially or completely severed from the rest, the backing being attached to this part. This will permit the part to be removed from the object, leaving the rest of the front portion attached thereto. In the preferred embodiment, the backing portions are completely severed from the backing sheet. However, they can instead be partially severed from the backing sheet, e.g. by perforating the backing sheet or by cutting part way through the thickness of the backing sheet.BRIEF . ESCRI TiON OF DRAWINGS Arrangements embodying the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows part of a sheet of labels in accordance with the invention, with one of the labels detached from the sheet, and Figure 2 shows a different embodiment of a label in accordance with the invention.DETAILED ESCRI T ION O P PREFERRED E MB ODINENTS Referring to Figure 1, a sheet 2 of labels comprises a backing sheet, part of which is indicated at 4, forming a strip which is wound to form a reel. The backing sheet need not be in the form of a strip, and could alternatively simply be a flat sheet. A plurality of front label portions 6 are attached by their rear surfaces to the front surface 8 of the backing sheet 4. The rear surfaces of the front label portions 6 are coated with an adhesive of a type which permits the portions 6 to be readily attached to and detached from objects. The front surface 8 of the backing sheet 4 is coated with a material which facilitates the detachment of the front label portions 6 therefrom. The front label portions 6 have been formed from a continuous sheet attached by its rear surface to the backing sheet 4. The continuous sheet has been severed by die cutting to define the front label portions 6.The remainder of the sheet may then be removed from the backing sheet 4, although this is not essential. The continuous front sheet could instead be partially severed, e.g. by perforating or cutting part way through the sheet, to define the front portions 6, each front portion 6 being completely severed from the remainder of the front sheet when either the remainder or the front portion is removed from the backing sheet 4. The backing sheet 4 is severed by die cutting to form individual backing portions 10. Each backing portion 10 is attached by the whole of its front surface to a central area of the rear surface of a respective front label portion 6. Each front portion 6 and attached backing portion 10 forms a label. In the drawing, one of the labels is shown removed from the backing sheet 4 and turned over with respect to the other labels on the backing sheet. In peeling off the front label portion 6, the severed backing portion 10 is also removed from the remaining portion of the backing sheet 4. It will be observed that the rear surface of each front label portion 6 has an area 12 which surrounds the central part of the rear surface to which the backing portion 10 is attached. This area 12 serves to hold the front label portions 6 on the backing sheet 4 until they are peeled off for use, and to attach the label to an object. Information not shown is printed on the rear surface 14 of each backing portion 10. This information can be determined by removing the label from the object. Additionally, information is printed on the front surfaces 16 of the front label portions 6, this information being visible when the label is attached to the object. The severing or partial severing to form the front label portions 6, the severing or partial severing to form the backing portions 10, the printing on the rear surfaces of the backing portions 10, and the printing on the front surfaces of the front portions 6, can be done in any desired order. The embodiment described above involves labels which are attached to objects by an adhesive of the type permitting the labels to be readily removed. However, this is not essential, and any form of self adhesive can be used. Figure 2 shows an embodiment in which a permanent adhesive is used. In this embodiment, a front label portion 20 has a rear surface coated with a permanent adhesive and attached to the front surface of a backing sheet, part of which is indicated at 22. The backing sheet 22 is severed to define an individual backing portion 24 attached to a central area of the rear surface of the front portion 20. Two lines of perforations, 26 and 28, which extend through both the front portion and the backing sheet, divide the front portion into a central part 30 and two end parts 32 and 34. When the front portion is removed from the backing sheet, the individual backing portion 24 remains attached to the front portion. The label is then attached to an object by the permanent adhesive on the rear surfaces of the end parts 32 and 34 of the front portion.A user may then remove the central part 30 of the front portion, together with the backing portion 24, by tearing along the perforations 26 and 28 in the front portion.The user is thus able to read information printed on the rear surface of the backing portion 24. It is not essential for the perforations 26 and 28 to extend through the backing sheet. However, if desired, it is possible to eliminate the separate severing or partial severing to define the backing portion 24, and instead use a single set of perforations extending through toth the front portion and the backing sheet to define both the backing portion 24 and the central part 30 of the front portion to be detached from the object. In the embodiment of Figure 2, the part 30 of the front portion and the backing portion 24 correspond in shape and size. However, this is not essential.Furthermore, it is also possible completely to sever the part 30 of the front portion from the rest of the front portion. For example, the backing 24 may extend beyond the edges of the completely severed part 30 of the front portion, so that the backing serves to hold the parts 30, 32 and 34 together. A part of the backing attached to the central area of the part 30 can be partially severed from the rest of the backing, so that when the part 30 is removed from the object the partially severed part of the backing is also removed. The term permanent adhesive refers to an adhesive of a type which will not permit ready detachment of the label from an object e.g. a soluble adhesive .In fact the adhesive will not prevent detachment of the label from a backing sheet, as the latter has a special coating which is well known in the art, which will facilitate such detachment.
