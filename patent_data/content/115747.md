## Description
Electronic anti theft device with electronic key The subject of the present invention is an electronic anti theft device comprising an electronic key which can be engaged with a fixed receiver part having the function of carr Jing out a process of identification of the electronic key engaged therewith and of providing an enabling signal to actuator means when the electronic key engaged with the receiver part has predetermined characteristics. Anti theft devices of the said type generally include electronic keys in each of which there are incorporated electrical or electronic circuits, of the analogue or digital type, connected to electrical contacts fixed to the outer surface of the electronic key. The fixed receiver part is similarly provided with electrical dontacts which are accessible from the outside and are intended to couple with the contacts of the key when the latter is inserted in the receiver part to achieve the electrical connection of the internal circuits of the key with the internal circuits of the receiver part. The internal circuit of the electronic key may also be constituted solely by one or more resistors having a calibrated resistance value or may include more complex circuits such as for example memory circuits, shift registers, etc. The devices of the types noted above have a problem due to the fact that their correct operation depends in a decisive manner on the state of the electrical contacts of the key and of the receiver part. In effect, even a single partially oxidised or dirty contact can cause lack of recognition of the correct electronic key. The problem displayed by the said electrical contacts has a further aspect. The receiver part of an antitheft device is usually installed in a place accessible to the public, for example close to an access door to an environment of which it is desired to allow the opening only to the possessors of a particular electronic key. This gives rise to a real danger from acts of vandals who might damage the electrical contacts of the receiver part, thus making the identification of the electronic keys subsequently coupled to this receiver part impossible. The object of the present invention is to provide an electronic anti theft device of the electronic key type which does not have the disadvantages of the prior art devices and in which both the electronic key and the receiver part do not require electrical contacts which are accessible from outside for operation of the device. In order to achieve this object the present invention provides an electronic anti theft device of the type specified above, the main characteristic of which lies in the fact that the receiver part comprises an oscillator, a resonant circuit connected to the oscillator and including a first inductance, a detector circuit arranged to output an electrical signal indicative of variations in the voltage characteristics across the first inductance, a comparator circuit connected to the detector circuit and arranged to output an enabling signal when the sequential combination of the signal output of the detector circuit coincides with a predetermined sequential combination. and in that the electronic key includes a second inductance which can be coupled magnetically to the first inductance due to the coupling of the elec tronic key to the receiver part, and an electronic control circuit connected to the second inductance and arranged to vary statically the degree of magnetic coupling between the first and second inductances in a predetermined manner when the electronic key is coupled to the receiver part, so as to cause corresponding variations in the characteristics of the voltage across the first inductance. The further characteristics and advantages of the electronic anti theft device according to the invention will emerge fromthe detailed description which follows, given with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a partially sectioned view of one embodiment of the device according to the invention, Figure 2 is an electrical diagram illustrating the circuits included in the fixed receiver part and in the electronic key of the device according to the invention, and Figure 3 illustrates graphically possible waveform of a voltage signal present in the electronic circuit of the electronic key of the device according to the invention. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the electronic anti theft device according to the invention includes an electronic key 1 which can be engaged with a receiver part 2 fixed, for example, to a wall 3 close to a door for access te an enviroiiment not shown . With reference to Figure 2, the receiver part 2 includes an oscillator 4 connected to a resonant circuit of the LC series type including a capacitor 5 and an inductance 6. 7 shows an amplitude demodulating circuit having its input connected to the common terminal of the inductance 6 and the capacitor 5.The output of the demodulating circuit 7 is connected to a comparator and recognition circuit 8 the output of which is connected to actuator means not shown constituted,for example,by devices for opening a lock or devices which control the operation of optical and or acoustical type alarms. The electronic key 1 includes a second inductance 9 intended to be coupled magnetically to the inductance 6 of the receiver part 2 when the electronic key 1 is engaged with the receiver part. For this purpose, as illustrated by way of example in Figure 1, the receiver part 2 includes a support body 2a having afrontally open recess 2b for receiving a complementary shaped projection la which extends from an end face of the electronic key t. Within the receiver part 2, around the walls which define the recess 2b ,is located the winding of the inductance which in the embodiment illustrated, is constituted by an annular coil. Within the projection la of the electronic key 1 is located the winding of the inductance 9 Mich is also constituted by an annular coil. When the electronic key 1 is engaged with the receiver part 2 the projection 1a of the key engages the recess 2b of this receiver part and the inductance winding 9 is located concentrically within the inductance winding 6. The magnetic field generated by the current circulating in the inductance 6 is, in this situation, coupled to the inductance winding 9 of the electronic key 1. A transistor 10, of the NPN type1 hays its emitter connected to one end of the inductance winding 9 and its collector connected to the other end of this winding through a resistor 11. This resistor has a rather low resistance value. The point of connection of the inductance winding 9 to the resistor 11 is connected to the anode of a rectifier diode 12, the cathode of which is connected to the input of a stabilized supply 13. A capacitor 14 is connected between the cathode of the diode 12 and earth. 7A coded binary signal generator circuit 15 has its output connecte o the base of the transistor 10 through a resistor 16 and an inverter 15a. The coded signal generator circuit 15 is arranged to output an information signal of the type illustrated by way of example in Figure 3. This signal includes successive signal portions of equal duration T with each of which is associated an information bit. Each of these signal portions may assume a first or a second waveform according to whether the information bit associated therewith corresponds to a logic 0 or a logic 1 .In particular, for reasons which will be clarified below, the waveform associated with 0 is preferably constituted by a pulse of duration T having a constant amplitude V0. The waveform associated with 1 is constituted by a pulse of duration tz T, having a constant amplitude V0 followed or preceded by an interval of duration T t in which the signal has substantially zero amplitude. Figure 3 shows a portion of signal associated with the sequence .. ....010,... . The waveform 3 associated with the 0 and the 1 may obviously be interchanged. On the basis of what has been explained above a characteristic of the coded signal emitted by the generator circuit 15 is clear the average value in a time interval T of the coded signal emitted by the generator circuit 15 is always different from zero. The importance of this characteristic will be clarified in the description of the operation of the device according to the invention. The oscillator 4 is arranged ,in a manner known per se to generate a signal having a predetermined frequency wnicth is independent of the variations in the load impedance of the oscillator. Preferably the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit comprising the capacitor 5 and the inductance 6, under the conditions in which the electronic key is not engaged with the receiver part, is the same as the frequency of the oscillator 4. This frequency may for example, be 100 KHz. In the condition in which the electronic key is not engaged with the receiver part, the amplitude of the voltage across the inductance 6 remains constant.Consequently the output signal of the demodulator circuit 7 is a continuous signal, which,under these conditions, has a constant amplitude. It will now be supposed that the receiver part 2 is engaged by an electronic key 1. This engagement establishes magnetic coupling between the inductances 6 and 9 which constitute a transformer. Hence in this situation a voltage is established across the inductance 9 which is rectified by the diode 12 and smoothed by the capacitor 14. The rectified and smoothed voltage is fed to the stabilized supply 13 which provides a continuous stabilized supply voltage to the coded signal generator circuit 15.This latter circuit, which may comprise, in a manner known per se, memory circuits or shift resisters and heir control circuits. provides a coded output signal constituted by a succession of n bit. A portion of this coded signals has been described with reference toFigure 3 by way of example. This coded signal is passed through the inverter 15a to the transistor base 10. Consequently when the coded signal has an amplitude V0 the transistor 10 is cut off. When the coded signal has a substantially zero amplitude the transistor 10 is saturated. At each change from the condition of saturation to the condition of cut off of the transistor 10 there is a corresponding variation which can be sensed by the inductive component of the impedance of the resonant circuit in the receiver part 2.The resonant frequency of this circuit, and consequently the amplitude of the voltage across the inductance 6 varies correspondingly. In other words, the coded signal emitted by the generator circuit 15 acts as a signal modulating the amplitude of the voltage across the inductance 6. The amplitude demodulator 7 outputs a unidirectional signal the sequential progress of which follows the variations in the sequential progress of the modulating signal, that is, the signal putput of the generator circuit 15. The signal output of the demodulating circuit 7 is compared by the comparator and recognition circuit 8 with a predetermined reference sequence.When these coincide, the electronic key 1 coupled to the receiver part 2 is reconised and the comparator and recognition circuit 8 outputs an enabling signal to actuator means of the type mentioned above, or prevents the actuation of alarm means. In the case of lack of recognition of the key, the comparator and recognition circuit 8 activates the alarm means or inhibits the actuation of the actuator means mentioned above. When the signal output of the generator circuit 15 causes saturation of the transistor 10 the inductance 9 is substantially short circuited. In this situation it is necessary that the short circuiting of the inductance 9 does not last for an excessively long time, in order to avoid reduction of the supply of the codedsignal generator circuit 15. For this purpose the coded signal ouput of the generator circuit 15 must not remain at the low level beyond a fraction of the duration T of an individual portion of the coded signal. The above mentioned characteristic of the coded signal output of the generator circuit 15 lies in the fact that this coded signal has an average v lue which is not zero in any time interval of duration T, ensuring the continuity of the supply to the coded signal generator circuit 15 when the key 1 is inserted in the receiver part 2. When the electronic key 1 is removed from the receiver part of the signal output of the demodulator circuit 7 again takes on a constant amplitude equal to that present before the insertion of the Xey, while the coded signal generator circuit 15 within the key, after a certain delay related to the discharge time constant of the capacitor 14, stops operating. The electronic key anti theft device according to the present invention has the advantage of not requiring the use of fixed contacts for the key and the receiver part and thus is free of all the disadvantges which result from the presence or such contacts.
