# A method and device for application of objects onto a surface.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method and device for applying an object 11 , e.g. and antiobiotic patch onto a receiving adhesive surface 19 , e.g. an agar surface. The objects 11 are piled in a storage container 10 , which is upwardly open, and the receiving surface 19 located above this is turned downwards. For application of the object 11 onto the surface 19 the whole pile is lifted towards the surface while the storage container 10 is not moved so that the uppermost object in the pile is pressed against and adheres to the receiving surface 19 , after which the pile is lowered again.
