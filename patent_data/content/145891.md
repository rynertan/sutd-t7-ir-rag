# Automatic electrowelding machine.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an automatic electro welding machine for large size components, with a welding head controlled by a programmable unit and associated with devices which move it along three axes located at right angles with each other the welding head includes the sens ing finger transmitting to the control unit the signals re quired for the automatic variations and self learning of the execution program. The sensing finger can both disclose any deviations of the actual welding line, to be performed by the welding head, from the theoretical line stored in the control unit thus determining the correction of the latter, and guide the welding head in the automatic self learning procedure of the execution program.
