# Impeller and shaft assembly for high speed gas compression.

## Abstract
The impeller hub 12 is provided with an outwardly tapered socket 38 in which is seated a frustoconical extremity 20 of the drive shaft 22 , the circumferentiai wall of the extremity having formed therein axially extending grooves 42 alternating with intervening lands 44 , and the socket and extremity being dimensioned and shaped in said manner that, in the finally seated relation of the parts, the lands plastically deform the socket wall material which has a lower compressive yield strength than the extremity. This assembly has a high torque capacity and is especially suitable for use in centrifugal gas compressors designed to operate at relatively high speeds.
