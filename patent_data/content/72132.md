# Apparatus for heat sealing of thermoplastics straps.

## Abstract
Apparatus for heat sealing together two layers of thermo plastics strap 26, 28 , comprising one or more thin, flat, elec trical heating elements 16 supported under tension by use of a tensioning element 22 and means for moving said support ing means so that in use the heating element moves between the two strap layers 26, 28 in the longitudinal direction of the strap. The heating element is moved forward and then back, being supplied with heating current only during the reverse stroke, during which a fusing pressure is applied to the strap layers by means of resilient pads 30, 32 . The tensioning element 22 may be a U shaped bend at one end of the heating element. Current may be supplied by contacts running along rails to avoid flying leads. Pressure plates 90, 92 squeeze the strap components together above and below the heating element s 16, 16A . In addition a heated cutter 114 is provided to sever one of the strap components.
