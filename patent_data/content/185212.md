# Control system for a power converter driving a synchronous motor.

## Abstract
In a control system for a power converter 12, 13, 14 driving a synchronous motor 15 , comprising a controllable rectifier 12 and an inverter 14 of a load commutation type, a speed target is passed through a variation rate limiter 24 for limiting the variation rate to produce a speed reference varied to follow the speed target but within a limited rate. A speed controller 18 is responsive to the speed reference and the detected speed of the motor 15 for producing a current reference. A current control circuit 19, 21, 23 is responsive to the current reference and the detected current of the rectifier for adjusting the average current through the rectifier thereby to reduce the deviation of the detected speed from the speed reference. The current control means comprises means 19c for causing intermission of the current through the rectifier for intermission commutation of the inverter when the detected speed is below a predeter mined threshold. A phase angle controller 22 is responsive to the detected rotary position of the motor 15 and determies sthe firing phase angle of the inverter 14 , and causes load commutation of the inverter when the detected speed is higher than the predetermined threshold. The speed controller resets the current reference at zero when the detected speed exceeds the predetermined threshold.
