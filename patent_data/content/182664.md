# Low noise oscillator.

## Abstract
A low noise oscillator. A circuit configuration is provided for reducing noise sidebands in the output of an oscillator due to modulation of the oscillation signal by characteristic noise produced by the amplifying element. A gallium arsenide field effect transistor that produces characteristic noise is operated as a linear amplifier. Positive feedback to the input of the amplifier is provided by a resonator. The amplitude of the oscillation signal is limited by a distinct limiting circuit in the feedback loop, the input to which is isolated from the amplifier by a high pass filter, thereby divorcing the non linear limiting function of the oscillator from the amplifying function where noise is generated.
