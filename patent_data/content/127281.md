# An electrode for a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes an electrode having triple layer electrode structure or a multilayer interconnecting structure comprising a contact a lower conductive layer 17 of aluminum or its alloy which comes into contact with a silicon substrate 1 , a barrier 18 of refractory metal nitride e.g. titanium nitride and refractory metal e.g. tung sten , and a upper conductive layer 19 of aluminium or its alloy. The TiN W barrier layer 18 prevents over dissolution of silicon into aluminum in spite of heat treatment at a rela tively elevated temperature.
