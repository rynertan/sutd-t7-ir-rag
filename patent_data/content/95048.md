## Description
COMPOSITION, COATED ARTICLE AND METHOD OF COATINGTechnical FieldThe present invention is concerned with coating a substrate which contains an electrically conductive pattern on at least one major surface of the substrate and is especially concerned with providing a top seal to coat solder connector patterns under an attached integrated circuit chip. The present invention is also concerned with the method for providing such a coating. In addition, the present invention is concerned with certain preferred compositions which are suitable for providing a top seal.Background ArtDuring the preparation of integrated circuit modules, input output I O pins are inserted into a substrate. The input output pins provide the needed electrical connections to the integrated circuit chip or chips which are subsequently connected to the substrate or carrier. The integrated circuit chips are attached to the integrated circuit substrate or carrier by applying solder to preselected areas on the substrate which are generally referred to in the art as the chip pad areas . Such areas can be defined, for instance, by providing preselected exposed areas of a metal which will accept the solder, such as copper. In addition, a solder flux composition is normally applied to the substrate to facilitate the application of the solder to the chip pad area.After solder is applied to the chip pad area, any flux and or flux residue is removed prior to attaching the integrated circuit chip so as to provide as clean a module as possible.After attachment of the integrated circuit chip s and subsequent flux residual removal, a top seal coating composition is applied to the integrated circuit module in order to protect the top side of the module which contains the integrated circuit chip from corrosion and or electromigration.Top seal compositions are employed in order to prevent failure of the substrate and device due to corrosion to immobilize conductive particles to extend the thermal fatigue life of the solder interconnection between the substrate and chip and to act as a protective barrier for alpha particle sensitive semiconductors. However, the top seal compositions which are now commercially employed, although for the most part satisfactory, do not provide all of the above desirable functions to a satistac tory degree. For instance, the top seal compositions now employed provide satisfactory levels of at most three of the above functions. Accordingly, depending upon desired use of the integrated circuit module, one or more of the above functions is normally compromised by the selection of the particular top seal composition employed.One of the more common types of top seal compositions employed is obtained from curing a composition containing as the binder a polyamide imide.In addition, the top seal composition must possess the type of flow characteristics needed to coat the solder pattern in a reliable and controllable manner.Summary of InventionReference should now be made to the appended claims in which the invention is set out.The present invention makes it possible to achieve all of the abovediscussed objectives desired from a top seal composition at satisfactory levels, and, therefore, none of such functions need to be compromised. In particular, the present invention provides for uniform coating of complex solder connection patterns under an attached integrated circuit chip.Moreover, the present invention provides for an excellent a particle barrier beneath the chip and provides for excellent passivation of the metallurgy on the chip. In addition, the coatings, in accordance with the present invention, are extremely thermally stable and are tough when cured.Moreover, the coatings when formed from the compositions of the present invention are essentially free from pinholes.In particular, the present invention is concerned with an electronic circuit which includes a substrate an electrically conductive pattern formed on the substrate and a coating over the conductive pattern on at least one surface of the substrate.The coating is a continuous film formed from a soluble, polymerizable oligomer having a number average molecular weight of from 200 to 10,000, having more than two appendant acetylenic groups and having the formula EMI3.1 wherein D isEMI3.2 wherein M isEMI3.3 wherein R is an alkyl or aromatic group wherein Ar is an aromatic group wherein x is the number of appendant acetylenic groups and is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, and y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x and wherein n is an integer from 1 to 10.Moreover, the present invention is concerned with a method for providing a coating on a substrate which substrate contains an electrically conductive pattern. The process comprises coating at least one major surface of the substrate with a composition containing a soluble polymerizable oligomer as described hereinabove and then hardening the composition by further polymerization of the oligomer.Another aspect of the present invention is a composition which contains a soluble polymerizable oligomer as described hereinabove and at least one plasticizer and or at least one toughener. The plasticizer can be diphenyl diacetylene, and or diphenylbutadiene, and or diphenylether, and or phenyltriethynyl silane, and or 4,4 diethynyldiphenyl ether. The toughener can be aromatic diphenyl ether acrylonitrile polymers, polyimides, polyesters, polysilicones, polyquinoxalines, cyclized poly arylacetylene polymers or mixtures of any of the above. The plasticizer and or toughener are present in an amount sufficient to increase the fluidity and or toughness of the composition.Description of DrawingThe Figure is a schematic cross section of a substrate and chip containing a top seal composition in accordance with the present invention. Best and Various Modes for Carrying out InventionAccording to the present invention, a continuous film is formed on a substrate from a composition containing a soluble, polymerizable oligomer having a number average molecular weight of from 200 to 10,000, having more than two appendant acetylenic groups and having the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein D isEMI4.2 wherein M isEMI4.3 wherein R is an alkyl or aromatic group wherein Ar is an aromatic group wherein x is an integer greater than two but less than 30, z is either zero or an integer, and y is an integer with the sum of y and z equal to x and wherein n is an integer from 1 to 10. Preferably, such R alkyl groups contain 1 6 carbon atoms and such aromatic groups contain 6 10 carbon atoms. Oligomers employed according to the present invention are disclosed along with a method for the preparation thereof in U.S. Patents 4,258,079 and 4,273,906. The oligomers are prepared by reacting a monomer containing at least two acetylenic groups in the presence of a molar excess over the monomer of an aromatic monoacetylenic capping agent and in the presence of an oxygen carrying amine basic cupric salt complex catalyst. The preferred capping agent is an aromatic monoethynyl compound which can be represented by the formula EMI4.4 wherein R is H, halogen, lower alkyl containing up to 6 carbon atoms, or lower alkoxy containing up to 6 carbon atoms. The most preferred capping agent is phenylacetylene. The single ethynyl group of the capping agent enters into the coupling reaction, but because the molecule has only one ethynyl group, further coupling is terminated.A molar excess of the capping agent is employed so that the molecular weight of the oligomer is properly controlled.Examples of amines employed to provide the catalyst include pyridine and alkylene polyamines such as tetramethylethylene diamine. A suitable copper salt to employ to provide the catalyst is CuCl. The catalyst can be preoxidized by bubbling 02 through the mixture for several minutes before the addition of the catalyst to the reaction mass.The oligomers employed in the present invention are preferably obtained from 1,3,5 triethynylbenzene. The preferred molecular weight of oligomers employed in the present invention is 400 to 2000. Preferably, at least 60 of the acetylenic groups for purposes of the present invention are diacetylenic and most preferably each oligomer molecule contains at least two diacetylenic groups. It is most preferred that diacetylenic groups constitute most of the appendant acetylenic groups.The preferred oligomers have up to 20 ethynyl content. Mixtures of the above oligomers can be employed. In addition, the ingredients in D in the above formula may be mixtures of the materials specified. By polymerizing mixtures of the oligomers, useful copolymers can be obtained. Furthermore, the aromatic groups can be substituted such as by alkyl groups of up to 6 carbon atoms and by halogens. Such substituents do not enter into or interfere with the polymerization reaction. However, because the compositions are intended for high temperature use, preferably alkyl groups are not present in view of their tendency to degrade at elevated temperatures. Examples of aromatic groups include phenyl and biphenyl.The most preferred oligomer employed according to the present invention has the following characteristics 6 20 free ethynyl groups per aromatic ring. M 1500 2500 z Mw 1000 1200 w Mn 700 900 n The preferred oligomers employed in the present invention can be prepared in accordance with Example 1 or Example 2 of U.S. Patent 4,273,906 and most preferably in accordance with Example 2.The coating compositions employed according to the present invention preferably contain a toughening agent and or plasticizer and are preferably employed in solution form.
