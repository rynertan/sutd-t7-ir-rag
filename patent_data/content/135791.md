# BEARING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
The invention relates to a bearing arrangement for journalling a device, in particular a doctor blade carrier, which is designed to be able to move axially in an oscillating fashion as well as to be moved a certain angle about its axis from an OFF position, the rest position of the device, to an ON position, the working position of the device, and back. The invention is characterized by comprising a bearing housing 9 containing a hydraulic cylinder 34 having two pressure chambers to accomplish the axial oscillations, viz a first pressure chamber 35 axially outside the end of the journal 5 and a second, annular, pressure chamber 39 around the journal at a distance from its end, first and second connecting conduits 41, 42 to deliver and evacuate a pulsating flow of hydraulic fluid to alternately said first and second pressure chambers, respectively, to accomplish the axial oscillations, and a hydraulically powered turning de vice 50 inside the bearing housing with which to turn the journal in the hydraulic cylinders 34 to and from said on and off positions.
