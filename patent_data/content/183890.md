# Method of stabilizing emulsion explosives.

## Abstract
Method of stabilizing an emulsion explosive comprising an oxidant, a fuel, and an emulsifier the molecules of which have at least one double binding. The oxidant is emulsified in the fuel in the presence of the emulsifier, and a polymeriz ing reaction is effected after the emulsification to bind the molecules of the emulsifier chemically to each other.
