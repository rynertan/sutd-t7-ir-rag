## Description
AN ADJUSTABLE RECLINE CONTROL MECHANISM FOR FURNITURE ANDFURNITURE COMPRISING THE MECHANISM This invention relates to an adjustable reclinecontrol mechanism suitable for use in furniture of the kind comprising a carrier, such as a seat or bed for an occupant of the furniture, and a reclinable support such as a back rest or an arm rest, which is adjustably reclinable so that its angle of recline relative to the carrier can be adjusted to the needs of an occupant. The invention also relates to furniture comprising such a recline control mechanism. Reclinable supports often receive thrusts from an occupant. For example if a motor vehicle containing seats of the aforementioned kind rides over a bump in the road, a seated occupant may bounce on the seat and be thrown against the back rest. A thrust applied to the top of the back rest exerts a powerful moment against the reclinecontrol mechanism because of the leverage afforded by the length of the back rest. The power of the moment poses risks. Firstly the recline control mechanism may break.Secondly an adjustable recline control mechanism may be caused to jump out of controlling engagement because the adjustable mechanisms are designed to be easily disengaged and re engaged in alternative positions to bring about the adjustment of the angle of recline of the reclinable support. A commercial recline control mechanism employs weight biased latching means comprising a metal link pivotally connected to a reclinable support about a horizontal axis parallel to the axis of reclining of the support. Hence the link travels in response to adjustment of the angle of recline of the support and so this angle can be controlled by preventing travel of the link. This is effected by a downward projection provided on the link and which is biassed by the weight of the link into latching engagement between a pair of teeth belonging to a row of teeth fixed to a carrier. Abutment of the projection against a tooth prevents travel of the link.Adjustment is brought about by engaging the projection between an alternative pair of teeth. Only the weight of the link and frictional forces are available to prevent the link jumping out of engagement and the effective weight of the link may be momentarily reduced if the carrier is momentarily deformed downwards by a bouncing occupant whereupon the link may be disengaged. In addition, the link, if it is fabricated from plastics material, may not be of sufficient weight and the coefficient of friction between plastics surfaces will be low. We have now devised an improved adjustable reclinecontrol mechanism. Accordingly this invention provides for use in furniture of the type comprising a carrier such as a seat or bed for an occupant and a reclinable support such as a back rest or arm rest which is adjustably reclinable relative to the carrier, an adjustable recline control mechanism comprising a a link connectable pivotally to a reclinable support about an axis parallel to the axis of reclining of the support so that when so connected the link would travel in response to adjustment of the angle of recline of the support and b latching means for controlling the travel of the link and hence the angle of recline of a support connected to the link, the latching means comprising fixed and displaceable latching members, any fixed members when in use being fixed relative to a carrier and any displaceable members being secured to and displaceable with the link and wherein the fixed and displaceable members when in use are primarily biassed towards inter latching and are inter latchable in alternative positions so as to prevent travel of the link and so control the angle of recline of a connected support in one or other alternative positions, the control mechanism being characterised in that its latching means comprises at least first and second latching portions, the first latching portion being arranged to prevent travel of the link in a first direction and the second latching portion being arranged to prevent travel of the link in the opposite direction and wherein when in use the latching portions are spaced relative to the axis of pivotting of the link such that the force each latching portion creates in preventing travel of the link exerts a moment on the link which acts as an auxiliary bias towards inter latching of the fixed and displaceable members. Because the second portion controls the travel of the link in a manner which is the reverse of the control exercised by the first portion, it is possible to enable forces in opposite directions to produce the auxiliary bias by spacing the portions relative to the axis of pivotting of the link in such a way that the lines of action of forces in opposite directions pass on opposite sides of the axis and hence both a thrust applied to the front of a reclinable support and a thrust applied to its back can be utilised to provide the auxiliary bias. Although the primary bias may be provided by resilient biasing means alone, the link is preferably connectable to a reclinable support about a horizontal axis so that the primary bias towards inter latching is provided by the weight of the link supplemented by a spring if required. Such a link is suitably fabricated from plastics material. It is preferred to fabricate at least one of the portions of the inter latchable members from plastics materials because they can then be easily mass produced in complex curves which match the path traced by the displaceable latching members as they travel with the link so permitting a better register between inter latching members in at least some of the alternative latching positions. Preferably the fixed latching members are moulded integrally with the carrier and the displaceable members are moulded integrally with the link.The preferred plastics materials are thermoplastics materials optionally reinforced with fibre such as glass fibre. Preferred thermoplastics are polyamides and crystalline polyolefins, especially homopolymers and copolymers of propylene. The plastics material may be in the form of either a solid moulding or a structural foam, that is a structure comprising a foamed core enclosed within a solid skin. The invention is illustrated by reference to the drawings in which Figure 1 is a section on a central line of symmetry through part of a seat for a motor vehicle, the seat incorporating an adjustable recline control mechanism, Figure 2 is a perspective view on a smaller scale of part of the seat frame and fixed teeth shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a perspective view on a larger scale of the link shown in Figure 1, Figures 4 a and 4 b are schematic sections of an interlatching tooth arrangement, and Figure 5 is a sectional view on a central line of symmetry of a motor vehicle seat frame with an adjustable recline control mechanism incorporating an alternative arrangement of interlatching teeth. Figure 1 shows a seat for a motor vehicle, the seat comprising a smooth moulded plastics seat frame 1 from which upwardly extend a pair of opposed metal supports 2 only one of which is shown for a smooth moulded plastics reclinable back rest 3, supports 2 being mounted pivotally on seat frame 1 by means of a horizontal metal pivot 4 journalled into bearings 5 provided in opposed side walls 6 only one of which is shown of seat frame 1.Opposed side walls 6 are linked by appropriate structural cross members 6a, 6b see Figure 2 . The angle at which each support 2, and thus back rest 3, reclines relative to seat frame 1 is controllable by means of smooth moulded link 7 also shown in Figure 3 in perspective . Link 7 is pivotally connected to support 2 by metal pivot 8 which is parallel to pivot 4 and is journalled into metal bushed bearings 9 formed in the lower ends 10 of supports 2 so that link 7 travels back or forth as the angle of recline of support 2 is adjusted. By controlling travel of link 7 it is possible to control support 2, and thus back rest 3, in a chosen angle of recline. Travel of link 7 is controllable by allowing the weight of link 7 to bias generally downwardly projecting teeth lla and llb moulded integrally with link 7 into inter latching engagement with one or other of alternative first and second generally upwardly projecting ratchet teeth 12a and 12b which are moulded integrally with, and hence fixed relative to seat frame 1.Effectively, therefore, teeth lla and 12a together constitute a first inter latching portion of the mechanism and teeth llb and 12b together constitute a second interlatching portion of the mechanism. Because ratchet teeth 12a and 12b are fixed relative to seat frame 1, such inter latching prevents travel of link 7 relative to seat frame 1 and so also holds support 2 in a chosen angle of recline relative to seat frame 1. The angle of recline is easily adjusted by manually lifting link 7 by means of handle 13 to disengage teeth lla, llb, 12a and 12b, shifting link 7 and then allowing it to fall and re engage teeth lla and llb with other teeth 12a or 12b. In addition, the inter latching of teeth lla, llb, 12a and 12b does not serve merely to control travel of link 7 and the angle of recline of support 2. It also serves to transduce the force of a thrust on back rest 3, and thus on support 2, into moments on link 7 which bias link 7 towards inter latching irrespective of whether the thrust is applied to the front 14 or back 15 of back rest 3. This is achieved by the choice of spacing and ratchet configuration of teeth Ila, llb, 12a and 12b as follows Downwardly projecting teeth lla and llb are formed with flat thrust faces 16a and 16b at least approximately parallel to a plane tangential to pivot 8 and upwardly projecting teeth 12a and 12b are formed with flat thrust faces 17a and 17b which register with flat thrust faces 16a and 16b when teeth lla, llb, 12a and 12b are interlatched. Flat faces 16a and 17b face towards pivot 8 whereas flat faces 16b and 17a face away from pivot 8.Hence rearward travel of link 7 relative to seat frame 1 ie towards the right as depicted in the drawings is prevented by abutment of flat face 16a against flat face 17a. Should a rearward thrust on back rest 3 tend to disengage link 7, the ratchet configuration of teeth 12a, and particularly the relative positions of opposed slidable reverse faces 18a, 22a accommodates the small forward displacement of link 7 required to bring the corresponding thrust faces 16b, 17b more firmly into contact whereby further displacement of link 7 is prevented and the tendency of link 7 to travel forwardly ie to the left as depicted in the drawings does not impart significant sustainable force against teeth 12a.Likewise, abutment of flat faces 16b and 17b and the presence of inclined, reverse, slidable surfaces 18b of teeth 12b prevent forward travel of link 7 while ensuring that any tendency of link 7 to disengage and travel rearwardly does not impart significant sustainable force on teeth 12b. The force created by abutment of flat face 16a against a flat face 17a and the force created by abutment of flat face 16b against a flat face 17b both exert a moment on link 7 which provides an auxiliary bias of link 7 towards inter latching despite the fact that these forces act in opposite directions. This is possible for two reasons. Firstly teeth 12a are spaced relative to axis 19 of pivot 8 such that the line of action indicated by arrow A in Figure 1 of a force created on any flat face 17a by abutment of flat face 16a passes over axis 19 whereas teeth 12b are spaced relative to axis 19 such that the line of action indicated by arrow B of a force created on any flat face 17b by flat face 16b passes under axis 19 whereupon not only those forces on link 7 acting forwardly via teeth 12a but also those forces acting rearwardly via teeth 12b exert a counter clockwise as seen in Figure 1 moment on link 7. Secondly, as hereinbefore described, opposite forces are prevented from exerting any significant sustainable moment on link 7.Hence forces created by resistance to travel of link 7 in response to a thrust applied to the front or back of backrest 3 produce a moment which biasses link 7 towards inter latching irrespective of the direction of the thrust and the consequent line of action of the force exerted on a tooth 12a or 12b. This enables less reliance to be placed on the primary bias towards inter latching provided by the weight of link 7 and avoids the need to rely on frictional resistance to unlatching. In particular, successful fabrication of a recline control mechanism from smooth light weight plastics materials becomes possible. Row 20 of teeth 12b is fashioned in a gentle curve and the inclination of each flat face 17b is chosen to be orthogonal to the curve so as to match the path traced by tooth llb as it travels. This matching leads to more positive engagement between teeth llb and 12b. Such a curvature and variation in the inclination of flat faces 17b would be expensive and difficult to achieve using conventional metal forming techniques. If desired, the primary inter latching bias provided by the weight of link 7 can be supplemented by metal spring 21. Spring 21 also serves to bias back rest 3 to an upright position. In order to avoid harmful clockwise moments being imparted to link 7, inclined, reverse surfaces 18a and 18b on teeth 12a and 12b may, if desired, be formed so as to allow a small clearance between them and the corresponding inclined, reverse surfaces 22a and 22b on teeth lla and llb. A preferred arrangement is depicted in Figure 4 in which the teeth of a first interlatching portion of the control mechanism Figure 4a are dimensioned and arranged so that when the flat thrust faces 16b and 17b of teeth llb and 12b are in contact the clearance x measured in a plane substantially normal to the contacting flat faces between inclined faces 18b, 22b is greater than the clearance y between opposed flat faces 16a, 17a and is also greater than the clearance z between opposed inclined faces 18a, 22a of the corresponding second interlatching portion Figure 4b of the mechanism.Effectively, the preferred arrangement of interlatching teeth is such that x y z. In the alternative arrangement of Figure 5 in which like parts are identified by like reference numerals, the teeth lla, llb of respective first and second displaceable latching portions of link 7, instead of being radially spaced apart from each other relative to pivot 8 as in the embodiment of Figure 1 , are located in a plane substantially parallel to a plane tangential to pivot 8.Correspondingly, the teeth 12a, 12b of the respective fixed interlatching portions are equidistantly radially spaced from pivot 8, the respective first and second portions being arcuately spaced apart on an imaginary circle centred on pivot 8 so that a projection normal to the flat thrust faces of the respective sets of teeth passes on either side of pivot 8 whereby the forces generated by displacement of back rest 3 exert the desired counter clockwise auxiliary biassing moment on link 7. Although the illustrated specific embodiments are herein described in terms of each latching portion comprising a single displaceable tooth engageable with each of a plurality of spatially fixed teeth, it will be appreciated that each displaceable latching component may comprise a plurality of teeth engageable with a fixed component comprising a single tooth or projection.Likewise, although the herein disclosed teeth are of ratchet form, each tooth having a flat thrust face and an inclined slidable face, teeth of other configurations eg of rectangular cross section may be employed. The adjustable recline control mechanism of the invention does not rely solely on the weight and frictional characteristics of its component parts, but also utilises incidental forces generated in one or more of the components during usage of the mechanism to exert an auxiliary bias moment which helps to retain the latching members in interlatching engagement. The mechanism is therefore suitable for fabrication in light weight materials, such as polymeric plastics, and is particularly suitable for incorporation into automobile seats. The mechanism is also of utility in items of furniture such as chairs, settees with inclinable end portions and beds, and is particularly suitable for incorporation into items of garden furniture for which the low density, strength and corrosion resistant characteristics of polymeric structural plastics are particularly suitable.
