# Improved safety containers.

## Abstract
A container includes a stopper 12 hingedly connected to the lip 16 of the container, and a pin 26 slidably mounted in a slide channel 24 formed in the stopper and having an en larged outer portion 40 adapted to engage a recess 28 in the lip 16 of the container to lock the stopper in its closed po sition. Means are provided to prevent the pin 26 from sliding outwardly or inwardly unless manually pulled or pushed re spectively. When the stopper 12 is closed and the pin 26 is fully inserted, the upper side of the enlarged outer portion 40 of the pin is spaced from the stopper the minimum distance sufficient to allow the fingernail of an adult user to fit within a la terally extending groove 42 in the enlarged outer portion 40 so that the pin 26 can be pulled outwardly.
