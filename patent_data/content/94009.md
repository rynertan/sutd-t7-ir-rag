# A process of encapsulating aqueous liquid wastes in liquid thermosettable resins.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process of encapsulating aqueous liquid wastes in liquid thermosettable resins of the group consisting of vinyl ester resins, unsaturated polyester resins, and mixtures thereof, wherein the waste is emulsified in the resin. The invention is characterized by incorporating in the waste resin emulsion a water soluble salt of carboxymethyl cellulose in an amount sufficient to increase the amount of waste emulsified in the resins.
