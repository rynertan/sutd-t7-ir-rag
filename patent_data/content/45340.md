## Description
Two part moulded wheel made of plastic material for chil dregs vehicle.The present invention relates to a moulded wheel consisting of two identical parts made of plastic material which can be jointed by fitting elastically deformable grip means.The two parts of the wheel are also both provided with a support arm for the relative wheel driving pedal crank which can be also manufactured in one piece through a moulding process.It is already known wheels made of plastic material to provide toys mounted on wheels such as tricycles, hobby horses or the like which are ridden by the children by means of pedals mounted on the driving and steering wheels.The known types of wheels for such toys are expensive to manufacture both for the large number of dies necessary for the moulding of the various parts and for the construction system which requires the use of pins screws washers and the like.The present invention can be used to provide a simplee and strong unit which can be easily assembled and which is to tally made of plastic material. In this way its parts cannot rust or lose their colour.The particular characteristics of such a wheel are the following 1 possibility of moulding the wheel in two parts identical to each other produced by means of only one die in only one moulding process, through which also the guide means and the means of connecting the two parts as well as the support arm for the shaft of the relative pedal crank are obtained.2 The pedal cranks are identical and produced by means of only one die in only one moulding process, and also include the shaft of the pedal crank which fits in by snaplocking and rotates freely in the seat provided in the body of the arm integrated with the relative half wheel.3 The mounting of the wheel and of the pedal crank is rapid and thanks to the guide pins and seats as well as locking means which can be deformed and blocked does not require screws or other accessories.4 Only one die is used for the construction of the whole wheel and only one mould for the pedal cranks.5 Pins, washers, screws and other articles of metallic carpentry are eliminated.The enclosed drawing gives an example of an embodiment of the present invention. In the drawing Fig. 1 is an axial section of a half wheel through the axis of the pedal crank, while the second identical half wheel is in dashes Fig. 2 is a view of the external face of the half wheel along the line A a of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a view of the internal face of the halfwheel along the line B B of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a top view of the pedal crank andFig. 5 is a section of the pedal crank along the line CC of Fig. 3. Referring to the drawing the two half wheels, which are marked with la and Ib, are perfectly identical to each other so that they can be formed with only one die. Purthermore, such a die includes only one mould and only one back draft due to the particular shape of the half wheels la and lb. As a result they can be produced through only one moulding process.To this end both half wheels la and lb include a tread formed by a peripheral, hollow half tore having a semicircular section 2 which is joined to a central disc 3. The latter, at the axis X X of the half wheel, projects outwards in a short, hollow shaft 4 which forms the half shaft of the wheel, from the end of which a radial arm 5 projects being provided with an U cross section.At the end of the radial arm a tubular sleeve 6 is formed with a drilled hole 6a which has an axis Y Y parallel to the axis X X of the wheel and provides a seat for the hollow shaft 7 of the pedal crank marked with 8. In order to allow the moulding of the arm 5 integrated with the sleeve 6, during the moulding process of the half wheel la or lb, the disc 3 is provided with a radial opening 9 which is complementary to the shape of the arm 5. Little pins 10, which are spaced with equal angle shift from little, hollow cylinders 11 provided with holes for receiving the little pins 10 of the other half wheel project from the internal face of the half wheel la or lb in correspondance with the internal surface 2a of the half tore 2.In the illustrated embodiment three little pins and three receiving cylinders 11 alternated to each other are provided. The latter act as guide means for the mounting of the two half wheels la and Ib according to the exact centering requested.The connection of the half wheels la and lb is established through elastically deformable fixing means 12 and relevant housing means 13. Such means 12, 13 are formed in the central disc 3 of the half wheels la, lb. Hollow sleeves 12 project from the internal face 3a of the central disc 3 of the half wheels and provide a conical edge 14 projecting outwards. Two longitudinal slots 15 extend along the wall of each sleeve 12 thus forming between them two elastically deformable arms with conical edges 14.Such fixing means 12 are provided in positions diametrically opposed to each other and symmetrical to the housing means 13 with respect to the axis X X. The housing means 13 consists of bushes with cylindrical seats 13a having an internal diameter substantially equal to the external diameter of the sleeve 12. The seats 13a have such a length that the bushes 13 can engage the fixing means 12 when the two half wheels la, lb are in contact with each other. In such a position the conical edges 14 of the fixing means 12 project from the external face of the other half wheel. In order to establish a good connection between the two halfwheels la and lb, the peripheral edge of the wheel is provided on one half with an internal tongue 16, and on the other half with an external tongue 17, both axially projecting and engageable with each other.The mounting is effected by drawing near the two halfwheels la and lb to each other, inserting the little pins 10 in their seats 11 and the tongue 16 within the tongue 17 and pressing the half wheels against each other. With this movement, the two arms of the sleeve 12 approach each other along the slots 15 and enter the seats 13a of the bushes 13 sliding inside until the edges 14 of the arms project outwards from the external face 3 of the respective halfwheels la, lb. This occurs at the same time in which the peripheral edges of the half wheels la, lb come into contact with each other.At the same time the edges 14, which are now free, assume their original positions blocking themselves against the external edges of the respective seats 13a keeping the two half wheels la, lb joined together.The half tore 2 of each half wheel la and lb is provided with annular slots 18 for the fittings of the bead of a tyre which covers the wheel to make it less noisy and to produce a springing effect. When the two half wheels la and lb are coupled to each other, the wheel forms a single body from the hubs of which the arms 5 project which are in turn provided with the sleeves 6 for the pedal cranks 8.Each pedal crank 8 has a bos like shape as shown in Figs.4 and 5 and includes a central rectangular plate 8a with an external knurled surface in order to make the pedalling easier, while at their sides lightening windows 8b are formed. The body of the pedal crank 8 projects in a hollow shaft 7 which is formed substantially similar to the sleeves 12 of the fixing means of the two half wheels la and lb. The hollow shaft 7 is provided with two opposing slits 19 thus forming two longitudinal arms from the ends of which the conical teeth 20 project outwards. The distance between the teeth 20 and the body of the pedal crank 8 is substantially equal to the depth of the hole 6a formed in the sleeve 6 integrated with the end of the arm 5. by pushing the shaft 7 with the conical teeth 20 within the hole 6a both halves of the shaft 7 approach each other and penetrate along the hole 6a until the teeth 20 project outwards from the latter at the opposite side thus blocking the shaft 7 and then fixing the pedal crank 8 to the arm 5 so that the pedal crank 8 is free to rotate around the axis Y Y of the hole 6a.
