# ELECTRONIC BALLAST FOR FLUORESCENT LAMPS

## Abstract
An electronic ballast for a discharge lamp has a transistor oscillator arrangement comprising a single transistor TS , whose base is coupled to be driven via a feedback winding L4 of a transformer TR1 . A primary winding L3 of the trans former forms part of a resonant circuit connected in the collec tor path of the transistor. A secondary winding L5 of the transformer is connected across a discharge lamp 1 for the supply of high frequency alternating voltage to the lamp. The transistor is biased into class A operation, by a biasing means R2, R3 . This biasing means can also be used as a dim mer by adjusting the operation of the transistor along its characteristic curve to alter the collector voltage. The ballast has lamp connector terminals, 4, 5 a first one 4 of the terminals being connected to an a.c. voltage supply L , and the second of the connector terminals 5 being connected to a rectifying means D1 D4 . This ensures that the ballast only operates when an operative filament 2 is connected be tween the lamp connector terminal 4, 5 . Mains supply voltage is filtered by a line filter L1, I2, C1 C3.
