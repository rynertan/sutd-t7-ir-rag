# Engine turbo supercharger control.

## Abstract
An engine turbo supercharger including an exhaust gas turbine provided in the exhaust gas passage of an engine, a compressor provided in the intake passage of the engine and adapted to be driven by the turbine, a variable nozzle is provided in the exhaust gas passage upstream the turbine for changing an effective area of the exhaust gas passage leading to the turbine. The variable nozzle has a first posi tion wherein a smaller effective passage area is provided and a second position wherein a larger effective passage area is provided, a bypass passage being provided in the exhaust gas passage and bypassing the turbine, a bypass valve for opening the bypass passage when the intake pres sure of the engine increases beyond a predetermined value so that the intake pressure is maintained below the prede termined value. An engine intake gas flow detecting device is provided for detecting a physical value relating to the engine intake gas flow, a control circuit for discriminating an engine operating condition wherein the engine intake pressure becomes the predetermined value when the vari able nozzle is in the second position and moving the vari able nozzle to the second position when the engine operat ing condition is detected.
