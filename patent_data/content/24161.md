# CHEMICAL COMPOSITION FOR USE IN TREATMENT OF PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS METHOD OF TREATMENT OF PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS AND METHOD OF SHAVING TO REDUCE SEVERITY OF PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS

## Abstract
There are disclosed chemical compositions for use in treating the dermatological condition known as pseudofol liculitis. The chemical compositions comprise aqueous com positions containing cationic polymers, e.g. cationic quater nary ammonium polymers, said cationic polymers preferably being admixed with various additional agents. There is also disclosed a method of treating the condition known as pseudofolliculitis a method of shaving to reduce the severity of pseudofolliculitis.
