## Description
MINERAL OIL BASED SCRUBBING LIQUID COMPOSITION This invention relates to a mineral oil based scrubbing liquid composition suitable for use in removing hydrocarbons and or other organic compound impurities from a process exhaust gas or from waste air. More especially the composition of the invention is suitable for purifying such exhaust gas or waste air to separate pollutant hydrocarbons etc which are present in gaseous form and or in entrained droplet form. Exhaust gas and or waste air containing hydrocarbons as impurities occur in various manufacturing processes, for example, metal working operations, more especially metal rolling. There are at least two aspects which have to be considered, namely, the pollution effect on the environment and the loss of material which could profitably and advantageous be re used. Techniques and apparatus exist to scrub waste gases and or exhaust air containing hydrocarbons and other organic compound impurities. Scrubbing with mineral oil containing an antioxidant is known, for example. However, even with the best of the known once through, or recycling, techniques and apparatus it is very 3 difficult to achieve a target figure of less than 50 mg m of organic compound impurities when calculated as carbon. With increasingly striigent anti pollution legislation being introduced in many countries there is a requirement for an improved scrubbing composition which can be used in the removal of gaseous and or liquid hydrocarbons etc from the exhaust gas or waste air from a manufacturing process, for example, the rolling of metal. Moreover, such a scrubbing composition should be capable of being used under existing working conditions and plant dimensions, capacities, etc. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a mineral oil based scrubbing liquid composition suitable for use in removing hydrocarbons and other organic compound impurities from a gas, which composition is characterised by containing i a major proportion by weight of at least one mineral oil which essentially wholly distils between a lower temperature 0 which is not less than 250 G and an upper temperature which is not above 6000C ii 0.05 to 0.5 wt in total of at least one anti oxidat compound, preferably a sterically hindered phenolic compound and iii an amount up to 1.0 wt in total, preferably up to 0.5 wt , of one or more additives to improve absorption of impurities, which additives are either a one or more ionic or non ionic surface active agents or b said surface active agent s with one or more oil soluble polymers having a minimum number average molecular weight of 15,000. Preferred mineral oils are those having a lower distillation temperature of at least 3000C and an upper of at most 5500C. It is also preferred that the mineral oils used in the compositions of this invention are paraffinic mineral oils and or are highly solvent refined oils. Normally the mineral oil content of the composition will be at least 95 wt , preferably at least 97 wt . The preferred antioxidant compound s are sterically hindered phenols, for example, those sold under the Trade Names Ethyl 702 and Irganox L130 . Amine compound antioxidants, for example that sold under the Trade Name Irganox L 57 , may additionally or alternatively be employed. Preferred non ionic surface active agents are fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, for example, those sold under the Trade Name Emulsogen . Others are polyoxyalkyl ethers and alkylphenol polyoxyethylene ethers. Preferred ionic surface active agents employable in the composition of the invention are 1 metal especially alkali or alkaline earth metal, preferably sodium sulphonates by which are meant, for example, by products of white oil manufacture and lube stock manufacture, salts of mahogany acids such as can, for instance, be derived from petroleum refinery sources and or 2 metal especially alkali or alkaline earth metal, preferably sodium synthetic sulphonation feedstock. These include alkyl and alkaryl sulphonates, for example, toluene sulphonates, xylene sulphonates and also alkyl benzene sulphonates. Sodium alkylbenzene sulphonates are especially suitable. Generally, the alkyl groups contain 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 24, and may be branched or straight chain. When an oil soluble polymer is employed then it is preferred that it is an olefinic homopolymer or copolymer, but may also be, for example, a polyester. The minimum number average molecular weight of the polymer is 15,000, normally 20,000. The number average molecular weights referred to in this specification are those determined by comparison with commercially available standard samples of polystyrene of known number average molecular weights.Examples of suitable polymers are polybutenes, polyisobutenes, polymethacrylates. One commercially available polyisobutene is that sold under the Trade Name 11Paratone . Suitable polymethacrylates are those sold under the Trade Names Viscoplex and Plexol . Normally from 0.08 to 0.5 wt in total of the antioxidant compound s will be employed, suitably 0.08 to 0.12 wt and preferably 0.1 wt . The surface active agent s will normally be resent in amounts of up to 0.5 wt 8, suitably from 0.03 to 0.2 wt t. The polymer s , if used, may be present in total amount of up to 0.8 wt , normally up to 0.5 wt , suitably 0.03 to 0.4 wt , preferably 0.05 to 0.3 wt . It is preferred to employ both a said surface active compound and a said polymer. The scrubbing composition of the present invention may, if desired, also contain small amounts of one or more conventional additives, for example, pour depressants and anti corrosion compounds suitable for use with non ferrous materials.The total amount of all such optional conventional additives will not exceed 1.0 wt in preferred compositions. Two preferred classes of compositions in accordance with the invention are a those having a said mineral oil content of 99.75 to 99.85 wt and a said antioxidant content of 0.1 wt the remainder being the said surface active agent s and b those having a said mineral oil content of 99.45 to 99.8 wt , 0.1 wt of said antioxidant, 0.05 to 0.15 wt of said surface active agent s , and 0.05 to 0.3 wt of said oil soluble polymer s . It is to be understood that the amounts selected in each of the ranges in a and b must be such that the sum total is 100 . Although a composition in accordance with this invention can be used as the sole scrubbing liquid, it is employed to better advantage as a second stage treatment liquid for the treatment of gases which have already received a conventional washing. This will more especially be the case where the composition is to be used in metalworking plants, for example, rolling mills. A composition of the invention is capable of being employed in a cyclic manner, whereby it is used, then treated and then recycled. Thus, having been used as a scrubbing liquid the contaminated composition is removed to a tank or like means where solid contamination is removed and impurities are stripped out.The cleansed composition is then pumped back for scrubbing further contaminated exhaust gas or waste air. The composition of the invention stands up well to continued recycling, with only small losses of active ingredients and of the mineral oil base. The following non limitative examples are given by way of illustration of the invention Example 1 A scrubbing composition was prepared having the following components and weights thereof Paraffinic based petroleum 99.8 wt mineral oil, boiling substantially wholly in the range 3000C to 550 C. Antioxidant being a sterically hindered 0.1 wt phenol .Surface active agent being a monosodium 0.1 wt sulphonate . The composition reduced the amount of organic compounds in 3 3 a waste air source from 48 mg carbon m air to 24 mg carbon m air, at comparable air flow and treatment conditions.Example 2 A scrubbing composition was prepared having the following components and weights thereof Mineral oil as in Example 1 99.6 wt Antioxidant as in Example 1 0.1 wt Surface active agent as in Example 1 0.1 wt Oil soluble polymer as in Example 2 0.2 wt This composition gave a somewhat higher percentage reduction of impurities than the composition of Example 1. In these two examples the initial contaminant level of the waste air was at about the final level achievable with conventional mineral oil based scrubbing liquids. The treatment with compositions in accordance with the invention clearly very significantly further reduces the contaminant level.
