# Cabtilt system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A tilting cab is lifted by hydraulic cylinders to swing about pivots 276 on opposite sides of the cab. A sensing rod 302 is carried on a pivot 300 and slides in a bearing 304 when the cab is lifted in a level condition. When cocking occurs shown by broken lines the rod 302 swings and moves rod 306 in or out to operate a synchronising spool valve 10 which controls the supply of fluid to the two lifting cylinders, slowing or stopping one of the cylinders until the other brings the cab level again.
