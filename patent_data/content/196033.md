# MULTILEVEL IMAGING OF PHOTOPOLYMER RELIEF LAYER FOR THE PREPARATION OF CASTING MOLDS

## Abstract
Process for photofabricating master relief patterns from photohardenable layers, e.g., 0.01 to 0.5 inch 0.25 to 12.7 mm in thickness which comprises 1 exposing the layer through the back surface to first imagewise modulated actinic radiation for time to render layer insoluble to first preselected depth which when measured from back surface is less than layer thickness, 2 exposing overall to actinic radiation through back to render layer insoluble to second preselected depth which when measured from back surface is less than first preselected depth, 3 exposing imagewise through front sur face to actinic radiation for a time sufficient to render exposed areas of layer insoluble to depth extending from front surface to at least second preselected depth, and 4 solvent removing soluble areas of layer. The master relief pattern is useful in making casting molds.
