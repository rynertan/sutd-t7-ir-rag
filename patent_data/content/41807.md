# Apparatus for obtaining a signal indicative of joint mobility.

## Abstract
Apparatus is provided which enables the assessment of mobility of human and or animal joints to be carried out. A flexible transducer 1, 23 includes a conductive elastomer 2 , which, when stretched, provides a change in an electrical output signal. The transducer is located over the joint to be investigated and during movement of the joint electrical sig nals from the transducer output which are a function of joint mobility, are produced. The signals are digitised and stored in a memory 17, 33 and are compared with a bank of data from normal and pathological subjects stored in a continuously updated memory 45, 34 . When the comparison locates the best fit between the joint movement and the stored data, the type of joint movement is classified and the result is presented on a visual display unit 43 . The movement signal can be conditioned so that the angular displacement of the joint, the rate of joint movement, acceleration of the joint can be esti mated and classified. The force produced by the joint can also be calculated using the acceleration and an estimate of the mass moved. This system permits the progress of an indi vidual to be monitored and to identify joint movement charac teristics in particular patient populations. The transducer, when combined in a composite unit with electrodes 27 , is also used to accurately assess the degree of neuromuscular activity during and after anaethesia.
