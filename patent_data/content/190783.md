# Method of and apparatus for rendering the cable core of a telecommunication cable longitudinally water tight.

## Abstract
For rendering the cable core of a telecommunication cable longitudinally water tight, a sealing material is applied in plugs and at regular distances in and around the cable core C moved at a constant speed, by means of an injection head 43 which can be displaced in a reciprocating move ment in the longitudinal direction of the cable core C the sealing material is injected by means of a rotating injection nipple 47 in a single continuous jet rotating in a radial plane around the cable core C .
