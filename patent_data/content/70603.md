# Synchronizing circuit arrangement for a television receiver.

## Abstract
An oscillator which generates a clock signal the frequency of which is substantially higher than the line frequency and having a frequency dividing circuit which derives signals of the line frequency from the clock frequency by means of division. During a predetermined number of line periods a phase comparison stage de termines the average value of the phase deviation be tween the received line synchronizing signal and a reference signal of the line frequency and applies the value obtained to a preset stage for adjusting in a sub sequent time interval, for example one line period during the field blanking interval, the divisor by which the frequency circuit divides the clock frequency. The clock frequency may be a multiple of the chrominance sub carrier frequency, in which case the oscillator is con tinuously readjusted by the phase comparison stage when the colour killer circuit is operative, while the divisor is not changed.
