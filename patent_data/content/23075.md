# Process for the preparation of cyclopropane carboxylic acid esters.

## Abstract
3 Halogenovinyl or propenyl 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid esters, which are precursors of, or may themselves be, pyrethroid insecticides, are prepared by the reaction of certain halogenopentadienes with an alkyl diazoacetate in the presence of a catalyst which is a transition metal complex of certain chiral Schiff bases, which catalysts tend to increase the yield of preferred cis IR isomer relative to the other possible isomers.
