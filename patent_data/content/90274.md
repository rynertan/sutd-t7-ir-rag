## Description
ABRASIVE ELEMENT OBTAINED BY ELECTROLYTIC DEPOSIT OF DIAMOND 1 As known, the so called diamond elements i.e. elements formed of small diamond chips incorporated into a consumable metallic support have been used for some years for the cutting of marble or stone blocks or, in general, for other operations to be performed on said materials. For instance, for cuts in a cave, diamond wire is used it is a highly resisting and suitably flexible steel wire or plait, with a 4 to 5 mm cross section area and with metallic pins these are small cylinders, with a diameter of 8 to 10 mm and a height of 8 to 12 mm, having a central hole of 4 to 5 mm inserted and blocked therein, said pins being possibly spaced one from the other by metal or plastic spacers which are in turn inserted and blocked into the steel plait. The outer surface of the pins is covered with a lining of abrasive diamond, i.e. very tiny diamond chips, applied by electrolytic or chemical deposit, or by sintering. For cutting operations, to transform blocks into slabs, diamond blades are used these are steel blades, 3 to 3.5 mm wide and, for instance, 180 nn high, along the lower cutting edge of which there are fixed by welding or brazing some diamond segments , i.e.elements in the form of a small parallelepipedon, for instance sized 5x7x20 mm, obtained by sintering of metal dust and very fine diamond chips. For other cuttings, also diamond discs are employed, i.e.steel discs onto house periphery are applied the already cited diamond segments . The remarks which have been made in connection with the use of diamond in the heretofore specified ways, are essentially the following in any diamond element, anyhow obtained, the abrasive cutting function is exclusively performed by the diamond, while the metallic material of electrolytic deposit or of sintering purely has the function of supporting the diamond. The choice of this binding material is very important, since the efficiency and life of the diamond element depend therefrom. In actual fact, during the cutting operation, the diamond may possibly get blunt, but it will not wear out as it is obviously harder than the marble or stone to be cut , whereas the ear or consumption of the binding material, by gradually laying the diamond bare, causes its breaking off and loss.For this reason, while on one hand it is preferred to utilize a soft metal, which opposes a minimum resistance to ear and thus allows the diamond to work in optimal conditions, even though it causes a very rapid consumption of the diamond element, on the other hand it is preferred to utilize a hard metal, which has the advantage of slowing down consumption even though, on the contrary, it partly hampers a proper ork of the diamond the use of a soft metal, as a bronze or a bronze alloy, has therefore been generally adopted in manufacturing sintered diamond elements, wherein a gradual consumption of the metal is actually required to lay bare successive diamond layers, as the superficial diamond layer breaks off the use of a hard metal, as nickel, has instead been generally adopted in manufacturing by electrolytic deposit, in particular pins for diamond wire, wherein a very thin and practically single layer of diamond chips or grains is applied onto a metallic support, whereby it is absolutely indispensable for the bond to be as strong as possible the diamond electrolytic deposit, which should in theory be preferable for its actual high resistance to ear, has however remained confined to the use in the production of the aforementioned pins, or of very special tools, for the very fact that these last ones are subjected, during use, to strong stresses, impacts and misusage in general, as could not be stood, for instance, by the usual sintered diamond segments.The same use has however not been extended to other applications wherein the diamond would be subjected to more uniform stresses principally because the thin single diamond layer, deposited electrolytically, though highly resisting to wear, has however a life which is limited in time even if acceptable in certain cases compared to a consumable sintered diamond segment. The reason for this limited life is to be sought in the fact that the thin diamond layer is applied electrolytically onto a surface of the metallic support element which lies and works parallely to the surface subjected to the abrasive or cutting action in particular, the surface of the bottom of the cutting groove of a stone block so that said thin layer, being subjected to wear simultaneously throughout its whole surface, breaks off entirely in a short while. Sintered diamond segments, in spite of their intrinsic minor resistance to wear, keep however their efficiency longer in time for the very fact that, due to the wear of a first thin layer of the segment, the diamond of an underlying layer is laid bare, and this continues up to consumption of the full thiclcness of the segment. The object of the present invention is to realize an abrasive diamond element, combining the advantages of the two heretofore described techniques, namely providing a high intrinsic resistance to wear, due to the fact that the diamond is bound electrolytically, and furthermore, a long life, due to the fact that it allows to utilize successive diamond layers. These results are obtained on account of the fact that the diamond element according to the invention essentially formed of soft metal and having at least a working surface moving parallely to the surface of the material subjected to the abrasive or cutting action incorporates thin layers of harder metal, to and or into which the diamond is applied and or incorporated electrolytically, which layers are positioned so as to form an angle with said working surface. According to the invention, use can be made of a very thin lamina of hard metal, onto the surface of which the diamond is applied electrolytically, and this lamina can be incorporated into the soft metal forming the diamond element, for instance by introducing it into the casting or sintering die so that its major surface may form a certain angle preferably of 900 with the working surface of the diamond element. Alternatively, the diamond can be applied electrolytically also directly onto a soft metal bar, which is incorporated into the diamond element in the manner heretofore described. In this case, the thin hard metal layer of support consists of the same layer of the electrolytically deposited metal. Both these techniques allow furthermore, according to a particular aspect of the invention, to incorporate the diamond lamina or bar into a support body formed instead of by casting or sintering of metal by moulding of suitable plastic material. In fact, this body just has a pure and simple function of consumable support, which can be excellently performed by a suitable plastic material. A still further possibility is to form, into the soft metal support body which will constitute the diamond element, some cavities in the form of notches or of holes, the major inner surface of which forms a certain angle preferably of 900 with the working surface of said diamond element, then to perform the electrolytic deposit of the diamond onto said inner surface and finally fill said cavities with soft metal. Finally, an even further possibility is to form a soft metal body which ill then constitute the diamond element having several surfaces inclined, preferably by 900, in respect of the surface which shall constitute the forking surface of the element, and apply the diamond electrolytically onto said inclined surfaces. All these methods of carrying out the invention, as well as all further characteristics and advantages of the invention itself, will result evident from the following description, made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an axial cross section view of a pin of the known technique, for diamond wire Fig. 2 is an axial cross section view of a pin realized according to the present invention Fig. 2a is a view similar to that of figure 2, with the pin partially consumed Fig. 3 is an axial cross section view of a different embodiment of a pin according to the invention Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are schematic perspective views of a diamond segment realized according to the invention and Figs. 7, 8 and 9 are schematic perspective views of other applications of the technique according to the invention to different types of grinding wheels. Figures 1 to 3 illustrate, as already mentioned, the application of the technique according to the invention to the production of pins for diamond wire . The pin 1, according to the known technique, has an axial hole 2 by which it is inserted on the steel supp ort plait not shown and blocked thereon by known means also not shown .A collar 3, also having an outer cylindrical surface, slightly projects from the outer surface of the pin 1, said collar being lined on its outer surface as well as on its shoulders 3a with abrasive diamond. In such a pin of the no run technique, the wear deriving from the normal ork simultaneously affects the whole cylindrical surface of the collar. Consequently, once the thin layer of abrasive lining has consumed as shown by the dotted line in figure 1 , or once the diamond has got blunt or has become smooth, the pin is no longer apt to perform practically any cutting function. In the pin realized according to the invention, the collar 4 has as opposed to that of the knolrn technique a corrugated profile, in particular with a double crowning, so as to form several inclined surfaces in respect of an ideal working surface, parallel to the cutting plane X X as results evident from figures 2 and 2a . With such a profile as clearly shown in figure 2a as the collar wears out, the diamond present time after time along the edges Xa, and which had not yet been affected by the wear, shows up. Also in the embodiment of figure 3, wherein the collar 3 has a frustoconical shape, the same result is obtained as the collar wears out, in correspondence of its part of major diameter, the diamond hitch had not been previously involved in the cutting action, is laid bare. In practice, therefore as opposed to the no on technique, wherein a relatively wide abrasive surface is entirely affected by wear, but rapidly ends its function the pin realized according to the invention has several cutting edges, which consume more progressively, thereby exposing to the cut a continuously renewed diamond surface. This evenness of consumption is not hindered by the resistance to wear of the material forming the collar, in that said material consists of relatively soft metal. Figures 4 to 6 show different ways of producing a diamond segment with the technique according to the invention. In figure 4, thin laminae 5 of hard metal, or even soft metal, onto the main faces of which the diamond is applied electrolytically, are incorporated into the body 6 of the diamond segment, with said diamond faces positioned substantially perpendicular to the working surface 6a. The incorporation of the laminae 5 is obtained, for instance, by placing said laminae directly into the casting or sintering die of the body 6. Figure 5 illustrates another way of realizing a diamond segment, which provides to prearrange small cylindrical inserts 7, onto the lateral surface of which the diamond is applied electrolytically, and to subsequently introduce said inserts 7 into corresponding milled seats S of the segment body 6. The inserts 7 may be simply introduced by being forced into the seats 8, or else be welded in said seats, or even screwed therein if appropriately shaped. The soft welding material may possibly be poured also between the diamond surface of the insert 7 and the lateral surface of the seat 8, without this hampering the regular consumption of the segment and the correct work of the diamond. As already mentioned, both in the case of the technique illustrated in figure 4, and in that of figure 5, the body 6 of the diamond element can be obtained by moulding of suitable plastic material.The incorporation of the laminae 5 figure 4 into a body 6 of plastic material presents no important problems, and the same can be said for the introduction of the cylindrical inserts 7 figure 5 into the body 6, by forcing, screwing or bonding instead of welding with suitable resins. Figure 6 illustrates a still further way of realizing the diamond segment, and precisely by forming a soft metal body 6, by casting or sintering, and making in said body notches 9, substantially perpendicular to the working surface 6a the diamond is then applied by electrolytic deposit onto the inner surface of said notches 9.Such a segment may be used as in the configuration shown in figure 6 i.e. with open notches 9 as well as after having filled such notches ith additional soft metal. All the segments shon in figures 4 to 6 may be employed in the usual ay, that is by being fixed for instance by welding or bonding ith their face opposed to the surface 6a, along the cutting edge of diamond blades, or along the periphery of diamond discs. In such uses, it has practically been found that the cutting speeds and life of the segments ere definitely higher and longer than those of the segments of knows technique. Figures 7 to 9 illustrate further embodiments of the invention, particularly concerning the production of a wheel for surfacing stone material figure 7 , of a composable element for a honing plate figure 3 and, respectively, of a grinding wheel figure 9 . In all these cases, the working surface of the wheel has a plurality of bores 10, substantially perpendicular to the actual working surface. In each of the bores 10 is inserted, by forcing, a small cylindrical diamond insert, as the insert 7 of figure 5. Also in this case, the wheel body can be obtained by moulding of suitable plastic material. Alternatively, the diamond is deposited electrolytically directly onto the inner surface of each bore 10, which is then filled with soft metal. The diamond elements realized according to the present invention and illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, allow to attain besides the already mentioned principal advantage of disposing of cutting edges whereon the diamond is progressively renewed, also the advantage of obtaining, with the same dimensions as the other diamond elements of knotn technique, far higher specific pressures of the diamond along the cutting line than in the knots technique, as lell as the advantage of realizing an improved mechanical bond of the layer of electrolytic deposit which retains the diamond. It is anyhow understood that the invention is not limited to the various embodiments illustrated, but that many other ways of application and of carrying out the invention are possible, according to the requirements of the single diamond elements to be realized, all of them falling within the protection scope of the invention itself. In particular, it is evident that the results of the present invention can be obtained with abrasive elements also having different structures from those heretofore illustrated in general, it will be sufficient for the working surface of the abrasive element not to be flat and parallel to the surface of the bottom of the cutting groove, but to be for example a knurled, threaded, indented, or like surface. Furthermore, since heretofore we have ai ways referred to an abrasive element of soft metal, onto which the diamond is fixed by means of a thin layer of hard metal applied elec trolytically, it should be here specified that, by the term soft metal , one means not only an intrinsically soft metal, as bronze or brass or even a soft iron, but also an intrinsically harder metal, as for example steel, which is however used in such a thin layer as to result easily consumable. This is for instance the case in which the abrasive element is in the form of a steel lamina, possibly corrugated, which is lined on its opposed surfaces with diamond fixed electrolytically and which is caused to work with said surfaces positioned perpendicularly to the surface of the bottom of the cutting groove.
