Preferred phenoxycarbonylaminoalkylthio hydroxydibenzoxepins of the present invention are those wherein X is hydrogen, Y is halogen and n is 2. As used through the specification and appended claims, the term alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical containing no unsaturation and having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, 1 propyl, 2 propyl, 1 butyl, 1pentyl, 2 pentyl, 3 hexyl, 4 heptyl, 2 octyl, 3 nonyl, 4 decyl and the like the term alkanol refers to a compound formed by a combination of an alkyl group and a hydroxy radical. Examples of alkanols are methanol, ethanol, 1 and 2 propanol, 1,2dimethylethanol, hexanol, octanol, decanol and the like. The term alkoxy refers to a group formed by removal of a hydrogen function from the hydroxy group of an alkanol. Exampies of alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, 1 and 2 propoxy, 1,2dimethylethoxy, hexoxy, octoxy, decoxy and the like. The term halogen refers to a member of the family, fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.The term lower as applied to any of the aforementioned groups refers to a group having a carbon skeleton containing up to and including 6 carbon atoms. The compounds of the present invention which lack an element of symmetry exist as optical antipodes and as the racemic forms thereof. The optical antipode may be prepared from the corresponding racemic forms by standard optical resolution techniques, involving, for example, the separation of diasteromeric salts of those instant compounds characterized by the presence of a basic amino group and an optically active acid, or by the synthesis from optically active precursors. The present invention comprehends all optical isomers and racemic forms thereof of the compounds disclosed and claimed herein. The formulas of the compounds shown herein are intended to encompass all optical isomers of the compounds so depicted. The novel aminoalkylthio hydroxydibenzoxepins of the present invention wherein R, is hydrogen are synthesized by dealkylation of an alkoxy aminoalkylthio dibenzoxepin of formula 2EMI2.1 wherein R is loweralkyl, R2 is loweralkyl, and X, Y and n are as hereinbeforedescribed, the preparation of which is disclosed in European Patent No.000 2508, to afford an aminoalkylthio hydroxybenzoxepin of formula 3EMI2.2 wherein R2, X, Y, and n are as above, followed by hydrolysis of the phenoxycarbonyi group of 3 to provide a compound of formula 4EMI3.1 wherein R2, Y and n are as above. The dealkylation is conveniently performed by contacting an alkoxy compound of formula 2 with a boron trihalide of formula 5BHal3 5 wherein Hal is halogen in a halocarbon solvent.Among boron halides there may be mentioned boron triiodide, boron tribromide and boron trichioride. Boron tribromide is preferred. Among halocarbon solvents there may be mentioned dich loromethane, trichloromethane, 1,1 ,1 dichloroethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, and the like.
