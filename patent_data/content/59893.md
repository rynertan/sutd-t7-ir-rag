# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE WINDING UP AND UNWINDING ON ROLLS OF TOWELING OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
The apparatus controls the unwinding and the winding up of rolls of towelling, wherein roll B₁ during winding up is held on a wind up roller 160 whose journals 162 are engaged in grooves 164 of two bars 166 mounted on support plates E₁ and E₂ of the support structure E of the apparatus. The weight of the roll B₁ being wound up rests on the periphery of a pull roller 92 actuated by gear means F₂ ending in a pull roller 48, which, in turn, is actuated by the pull exerted by the user on a loop B₆ formed by a length of toweling B between the roll B₁ and the unwound roll B₂. The latter roll is rotatably disposed on an arcuate bottom of a pivotable receptacle A₃ supported on a base plate A₁ of the cabinet A of the apparatus on a slidable pivot 14. The other end of plate B₆ extends either through an interspace 38 or between two bars 156 158 all said parts are located rearwardly of the base A₁. Suitable devices F₂, F₃, actuated by the pull roller 48, control by sensing means F₄ either the length of the loop B₆ from time to time formed beneath the cabinet A of the apparatus or the withdrawal on the wound up roll B₁ of the end of the toweling being unwound from unwinding roll B₂.
