# Optical information recording apparatus.

## Abstract
In an optical information recording apparatus in which a plurality of light beams are focused on a disc 7 to form a write read spot WS or an erase spot ES , the position of the light spots on a track of the disc is detected by means 4, 11, 12, 13 15 on the basis of which control means 14, 10 23, 28 control the distance between the light spots of the length of the light spots, so that even when the positions at which the light spots are formed differ in the radial direction of the disc, uniform and accurate write read erase of information can be effected irrespective of the light spot positions.
