## Description
Medical appliance for a symptomatic local cryopharmacotherapy of benign ano rectal ailments, such as haemorrhoids This invention relates to a medical appliance for a local therapy of benign ano rectal ailments, such as the home treatment of haemorrhoids. With reference to haemorrhoid pathology, it is known that the therapy most widely used in the home is based on the local action of drugs which are readily available on the market. It is equally well known that the benefits achieved are often questionable and frequently non existent, above all because of the manner in which the drugs are applied. Indeed, disadvantages are recognised which cannot be ignored, such as, for example, a mainly or solely external application, or a solely internal application suppositories which slide directly into the ampulla up into the anal passage itself.In addition to this, the temporary nature of the drug tissue contact is strongly dependent on the mucous secretions and the contaminating passage of the contents of the colon. For some time, a sedative therapy of haemorrhoids has been developed and become widespread, based on the 0 application of moderate cold hypothermia of about 10 C which in a relatively short time of the order of 1 to 2 minutes achieves a noticeable, temporary lowering of the sub mucous tissue temperature. In this manner, one or more of the following effects can be achieved antiinflammatory, decongestant, analgesic, antisphincteralgesic, anti edematous, and haemostatic. This sedative cryotherapy is conducted with a probe of suitable non toxic plastics material which forms a sealed reservoir filled with cold retaining gel.Generally, such a probe is cooled beforehand in a refrigerator and is used 2 or 3 times a day. It is recognised that sedative cryotherapy is useful to the point that it can be used as an alternative to local medication, but the cost of the probe and the obvious need for its replacement after short periods of use or non use is such that the majority of patients still make use of local drug applications. With specific, but non exclusive, reference to haemorrhoid pathology, the main object of this invention is to provide, for use in the home, an effective local therapy using hypothermia and drugs simultaneously or, more precisely, an effective cryo pharmacotherapy. This and other objects which will become clearer from the following description are achieved by a medical appliance comprising an elongate hollow body shaped substantially as a suppository, which has a rounded end, a sealed reservoir formed in the body and filled with a coolant, and at least one duct extending longitudinally within the body and communicating with the exterior of the body at the opposite end thereof. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an irrigation chamber is formed in the hollow body at its rounded end, the chamber being sealed from the coolant reservoir and communicating with the exterior of the body through a plurality of holes formed in the rounded end and with said at least one duct. Preferably, the duct communicates with the exterior of the elongate hollow body through a plurality of radial passages distributed along the length of the duct. To advantage, the duct and the hollow body share a common longitudinal wall portion in which the plurality of radial passages is formed. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clearer from the following description of one embodiment of a medical appliance according to the invention, made with reference to the appended drawings, by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a partially sectioned perspective view of a medical appliance according to the invention Figure 2 is a longitudinal section of the medical appliance, and Figure 3 is a cross section of the medical appliance of Figure 1 on an enlarged scale. With reference to the drawings, a medical appliance according to the invention, generally indicated 1, has structural characteristics,described below, which make it particularly, but not exclusively, suitable for domestic cryo pharmacotherapy of haemorrhoids. The medical appliance includes an elongate hollow body 2 shaped substantially in the form of a conical cylindrical suppository and made from a suitable nontoxic plastics material. The hollow body 2 has one rounded end portion 3, while the other end portion 4 is enlarged and is constituted by a frusto conical part 5 and a terminal cylindrical part 6. A circular base wall 7 is sealed in the body 2 close to its rounded end 3 by a conventional method, preferably hermetic sealing by ultrasonics, and defines an irrigation chamber 8 with this end. This chamber 8 communicates with the exterior of the body 2 through a plurality of holes 9 formed in the rounded end 3 of the body. A second circular base wall 10 is hermetically sealed about its periphery in the body 2 in such a position as to constitute a partition between the frusto conical part 5 and the cylindrical part 6 of the end portion 4 of the body. The cavity in the body2 defined between the base walls 7, 10 constitutes a reservoir 11 which is sealed hermetically by means of the ultrasonic method after being filled with a non toxic coolant, particularly a liquid gel of the type already widely used commercially, which is free from any toxicity and which retains and redistributes the cold. By way of example, this liquid may have the following composition water 94.2E citric acid 2.6 sodium chloride 1.3E 6 cellulose mw 2000 3000 1.9E the percentages being percentages by weight. The medical appliance of this invention further includes a duct 12 which extends longitudinally within the body 2 and is structurally independent of the reservoir 11. This duct 12 communicates at one end with the irrigation chamber 8 through a hole formed in the circular base wall 7, to which the end of the duct 12 is sealed. At the other end, the duct 12 extends externally of the circular base wall 10 by a portion 13 which constitutes a connector for connection to any source phial of local drugs in the form of liquids, ointments or the like. In accordance with a preferred but not exclusive embodiment, the duct 12 and the hollow body 2 share a common wall portion 12a which extends for almost the entire length of the duct Figures 2 and 3 . The duct 12 communicates with the exterior of the body 2 along this portion 12a through a plurality of radial passages 14 arranged in a line longitudinally of the duct. The medical appliance described above is used in the following manner. The appliance 1 is normally cooled to between 0 7 and 25 C in, for example, the freezer of an ordinary refrigerator, for a period of three to four hours.Before use, the body 2 of the medical appliance must be suitably lubricated, for example, oiled with 58 xylocaine gel which is cooled but not solid , and can then be easily self administered by the patient for, say, five minutes two or three times a day. During this administration, the local drug may be supplied through the plurality of holes 9, 14 by, for example, a syringe, drop by drop melting, or even by gradual and intermittent squeezing when it is constituted by a sufficiently fluid, though cooled, ointment. The advantages achieved are immediately evident and may be summarised as follows facility of use at home, even by untrained persons or patients possibility of achieving simultaneous cryotherapy and therapy with local drugs which are passed along the whole of the anal passage beyond that at the ampulla possibility of advantageous use for evacuative mini enemas, account being taken of the evacuative effect produced in the already dilated anal passage by the medical appliance and the cold sedation , and ease of manufacture at acceptable costs.
