# Barriers for use in a Langmuir trough.

## Abstract
A simple, easily operated and compact adjustable barrier for a Langmuir trough comprises an endless belt extending round pegs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . The area enclosed can be varied by moving the pegs 4, 5 towards the part 7 . Alternatively the pegs 1, 2, 3 or all five pegs can be adjustable for the same purpose. Alternatively, also the part 7 , or part 9 , or parts 7 and 9 combined may be rigid, the area being adjusted by moving the part 9 .
