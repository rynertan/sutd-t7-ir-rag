# Dissolution cell, apparatus including it, method of determining rate of dissolution.

## Abstract
A dissolution cell for use in automatic dissolution testing apparatus comprises a body member 112C and an insert member 110C and a number of flow channels 161 166. There is an aperture in the body member 112C through which the insert 110C can slide in an airtight fit. The insert can be slidably moved to align each of the flow channels individual ly with input and output ports in the body member 112C thereby defining a dissolution chamber 134C. There is an evacuation port 150C for evacuating air from a flow channel prior to its alignment with the inlet and outlet ports.
