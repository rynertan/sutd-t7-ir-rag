## Description
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of N acyl nitromethylene thiazines. Nitromethylene heterocyclic compounds are known to possess an interesting level of insecticidal activity see for example UK Patent Specification 1,513,951 in which the following compound is particularly exemplified Hitherto N substituted derivatives of Compound A and analogues thereof, have been synthesised by derivatising the heterocyclic Compound A or its analogues see for example UK 1.513.951 page 5 lines 55 61. However attempts to synthesise certain N acyl derivatives by the direct acylation of Compound A and its analogues failed to yield the desired derivatives. Moreover the synthesis of Compound A involved the use of hazardous intermediates and thus a route to N acyl derivatives avoiding Compound A was desirable. EP A 115 323 discloses a process for producing a heterocyclic compound having a nitromethylene group as the side chain, of the formula wherein Y represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a lower alkyl group, R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aralkyl group, an alkenyl group or an alkynyl group, and wherein X¹ and X² may be the same or different and represent halogen atoms, and Y is as defined above, to react with a 1 aminoalkanethiol compound or a 1 N substituted derivative thereof, of the formula wherein R is as defined above, and US A 4,052,388 discloses 3 acetyltetrahydro 2 nitromethylene 2H 1,3 thiazine and its use as an insecticide, together with its preparation by reacting 1 nitro 1 tetrahydro 2H 1,3 thiazin 2 ylidene 2 pentanone and sodium hydride in monoglyme together with acetyl chloride. US A 4006156 discloses 3 alkyl 2 nitromethylene thiazolidines having insecticidal activity which are prepared by reacting nitroketene dimethyl mercaptole ie. 1,1 bis methylthio 2 nitroethylene with a 2 alkylamino 1 mercaptoethane. US A 4065560 discloses tetrahydro 2 nitromethylene 2H 1,3 thiazines which may be prepared by treating a nitroketene dimethyl mercaptole ie. 1,1 bis methylthio 2 nitroethylene with a 3 amino 1 propanethiol. DE A 2514402 discloses 2 nitromethylene imidazolidines and 2 nitromethylene hexahydropyrimidines prepared by the reaction of a diamino alkane with a 1 nitroethylene compound. The Applicant has found a new process for the manufacture of N substituted derivatives of Compound A and its analogues which process avoids the need to use the heterocyclic intermediate A. The new process is attractive in that it not only makes available certain known compounds, it also yields novel compounds hitherto inaccessible by other routes. The novel heterocyclic compounds are claimed in copending application EP A 135 956. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing an N acyl nitromethylene thiazine of the general formula wherein R represents a formyl group, an alkanoyl group containing 2 to 11 carbon atoms, a fluoroalkanoyl group containing 2 to 11 carbon atoms and 1 to 5 fluorine atoms, a benzoyl group, an optionally brominated phenylsulphonyl group, an alkylaminosulphonyl group bearing two alkyl substituents or a dialkylcarbamoyl group, where each alkyl group contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a group of formula alkyl O ₂PX wherein each alkyl group contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms and X is O or S, characterised in that an amide of the following general formula wherein R has the above meaning, is reacted with a base in the presence of an inert solvent at a temperature between 30 C and 50 C, the base being an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydride or alkoxide or an alkali metal amide. Any aliphatic group present in the groups R preferably contains up to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable bases for use in the process of the invention are sodium or potassium hydride, sodium or potassium alkoxide in which the alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbon atoms and is preferably branched, e.g. a tertiary alkyl group, and sodium, potassium or lithium amides or dialkylamides wherein each alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. sodamide and sodium di isopropylamide. Any suitable solvent may be used, for example tertiary alcohols e.g. t butylalcohol, ethers e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane, ketones e.g. acetone, nitrogenous solvents e.g. dimethylformamide, hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, xylene and toluene, and sulphur containing solvents, e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide. The reaction may proceed at room temperature but in general it can take place at temperatures between 30 and 50 C, suitably between 20 and 30 C. The molar ratio of the reactants is unimportant, e.g. the molar ratio of base to amide can be in the range 1 2 to 2 1 but generally speaking it is preferred to have the basic reactant in excess, i.e. the molar ratio is preferably in the range 1 1 to 2 1. The N substituted S substituted aminothiol starting materials of general formula II are novel compounds, and form a further aspect of the invention. They may be prepared by a process which comprises reacting an aminothiol of the general formula wherein Hal is a halogen atom, in the presence of a base which is a hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or acetate of an alkali or alkaline earth metal or of ammonium, and in the presence of an inert solvent. Conveniently the base is an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. The inert solvent can for example be any one of the solvents referred to hereinbefore. It is generally preferred to isolate the amide of general formula II before subjecting it to the action of a base to form the compound I. However isolation of the intermediate II is inessential and the compound I can be made directly by reacting the aminothiol III with the halonitroethylene IV in the presence of base. The aminothiol compounds of general formula III may be prepared by N acylation of the corresponding unsubstituted aminothiol. The process according to the invention is illustrated by the following Examples. Examples 1 to 11 illustrate the synthesis of the novel N substituted S substituted aminothiols II , while Examples 12 to 19 illustrate conversion into the compounds of formula I.
