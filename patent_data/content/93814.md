# Cargo transporting vehicles and containers.

## Abstract
The cargo transporting vehicle 10 has a main cargo supporting deck 11 and an upper secondary cargo deck 25 , which may be removable. The secondary deck, when not in use, can be elevated up to the underside of the roof of the vehicle for storage. The secondary deck can have two or more levels, and can have a track extending along each side of the cargo space of the vehicle, the tracks being bridged by decks 26 . Each track can have rollers 23 to aid assembly and disassembly of the secondary cargo supporting deck.

## Description
This invention relates to cargo transporting vehicles and containers and has as its object the improved use of the cargo holding space of such vehicles and containers. For convenience hereinafter reference will be made simply to cargo transporting vehicles. It is well known that in many cargo transporting situations there is a considerable waste in the amount of cargo holding space employed since it is not possible with certain cargoes to stack items one upon another and as a result there is a substantial headroom not usefully employed. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a cargo transporting vehicle having, above its main cargo supporting deck, a secondary cargo supporting deck which is preferably height adjustable and which may consist of two or more levels. It will generally, however, consist of a single level. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a cargo transporting vehicle having, above its main cargo supporting deck, a secondary cargo supporting deck which is preferably height adjustable and which, when not in use, can be elevated up to the underside of the roof of the vehicle for storage purposes. The secondary deck is preferably constituted by a track along each side of the cargo holding space bridged by one or more deck tor platform elements. For ease of assembly and dismantling, and also of storage, the tracks preferably comprise two or more track lengths detachably secured together.Similarly the secondary deck per se is preferably constituted by a plurality of deck elements. The tracks are preferably supported at the selected height or heights by clips releasably engageable in slots in vertically disposed slotted support members secured to the vehicle side walls. Alternatively, the tracks are supported upon .shelves or similar adapted releasably to engage at predetermined heights in vertical channel members secured to the vehicle sides. With this construction, the shelves or similar, when not in use, can be pivoted into the channels out of the way. With this construction also, the secondary deck is preferably of unitary construction having, at each corner, means such, for example, as a worm and nut arrangement, a screw jack or a chain or cable and pulley arrangement whereby the secondary deck can be elevated from its in use position to an out of use stowed position at the vehicle roof. Clamps may be provided to secure the deck elements to the tracks, or, where the supporting shelves or similar are employed, to secure the deck to the tracks and shelves or similar or simply to the shelves or similar. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a cargo transporting vehicle according to the invention Fig. 2 is a fragmentary perspective view of a vertical support member and track Fig. 3 is a fragmentary perspective view of the track showing a clip Fig. 4 is a fragmentary perspective view of the tracks and secondary deck with detailed views of a clamp and alternative deck locating member and Fig. 5 is a diagrammatic perspective view of an alternative cargo transporting vehicle. Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, the cargo transporting vehicle 10 comprises the usual cargo supporting deck 11 mounted on a wheeled chassis 12, vertical front wall 13 and vertical side walls 14 and a roof not shown , all of which define the vehicle cargo carrying space. The open rear of the vehicle is closable by doors 15. According to this invention, there is secured to the side walls 14 at equi spaced intervals vertical support members 16 of flat channel configuration and formed with a series of horizontal slots 17. A track 18 is detachably securable to each side wall 14 through the intermediary of these vertical support members 16. The track 18 is constituted by a number of track lengths 19 say 8 foot lengths detachably coupled together. In this embodiment, each track length 19 is of RHS section as shown slotted as indicated at 20 at a connecting end, the track lengths being secured together by an internal RHS section block 21 mounting a clamping bolt and nut 22.It will be manifest from Fig. 2 how adjacent track lengths 19 can be easily connected together and disconnected. Each track length 19 rotatably mounts a number of wheels or rollers 23, which extend above the top of the track length 19 as shown, and has welded to it a clip 24 with upper and lower extensions 24A and 24B. The assembled track lengths 19 defining a track 18 are secured at the desired height above the deck 11 simply by inserting the upper extensions 23A into the appropriate slots 17 and then dropping the lower extensions 238 into lower slots 17. The two tracks 18 are now disposed at the desired height above the deck 11. The secondary deck 25 comprises a number of deck elements 26, each constituted by a framework 27 covered by a deck sheet 28. A flange 29 depends from the deck element 26 at each side. To assemble the secondary deck 25, each deck element 2 is simply pushed along the track 18, the rollers 23 facilitating this movement, until the full deck 25 is assembled. Flanges 29 engage on the outside of the wheels 23 and assist in locating the deck elements 26 relative to the tracks 18. The flanges 29 may alternatively be replaced by a depending channel element 30 which engages both faces of the wheels 23 and provides an improved location of the deck elements 25 on the tracks 18. A simple clamp 31 can be used to secure each deck element 26, at each side, to its track 18.This comprises a channel bar 32 engaging in the deck element framework 17 and under the track 18 and a clamping screw 32A, which can be screwed up against the underside of the track 18. It will be manifest from the above that the secondary deck and associated tracks can easily and readily be assembled at any desired height in a vehicle and also dismantled if not required or if not usable due to the height of the cargo. It can easily be broken down into its component parts so that it can be stored in a relatively limited space. There may be more than one secondary deck provided. The secondary deck may be assembled to provide two or more levels by arranging track lengths at different heights. Reference is now made to Fig. 5. In this embodiment, the vertical support members are constituted by vertical channel members 33, whereof the limbs 34 are formed with downwardly inclined slots 35. The secondary deck is mounted on these channel members 33 by shelves 36 or similar comprising a pivot pin 37, a track receiving formation 38 and an abutment 39 which contacts the channel face 40 and prevents downward pivoting of the shelf 36. The secondary deck 41 is constituted by the tracks and deck elements are described above save that clips 24 are omitted. In this instance, each corner of the secondary deck 41 is provided with a means for elevating it up to the roof of the vehicle 42 when its use is not required. Such means may be worm and nut arrangements 43 as indicated suitably operably couped together and to a convenient drive means. Any other form of means for moving the secondary deck 41 vertically may be employed. It will be manifest that the shelves 36 can be located at any desired height. Also, when not in use they can be pivoted into the channel members 33 out of the way. Finally, it is to be appreciated that the secondary deck 41 could be a permanent feature and in this instance may simply be a deck of unitary construction with integral runners for resting on the shelves 36, i.e. the tracks are omitted. As an alternative to the wheels or rollers 23 load bearing balls may be employed.
