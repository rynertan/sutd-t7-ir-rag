# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CORRELATING TIRE INFLATION PRESSURE AND LOAD

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for correlating tire inflation pressure and tire load in the field using static footprint length on a tire contact gauge 20, pressure sensitive recording paper 14 and a nomogram 40 46 to determine actual tire load of a tire 10 mounted on a vehicle 12.
