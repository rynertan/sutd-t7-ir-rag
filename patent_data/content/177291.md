# Recovery of gold from auriferous refractory iron containing sulphidic ore.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the pretreatment of refractory auriferous iron containing sulphidic ore to improve the subsequent recovery of gold, the pretreatment comprising treating the ground ore as an aqueous slurry with aqueous sulphuric acid solution 20 to decompose carbonate and acid consuming gangue compounds which might otherwise inhibit a subsequent pressure oxidation step, subjecting the treated slurry to a first liquid solids separation step 22 to produce a sulphate solution and separated solids which are repulped in a first repulping step 24 to form a slurry which is then oxidized in a pressure oxidation step 30 . The oxidized slurry is repulped in a second repulping step 32 and separated 34 to produce an acid and iron containing solution and oxidized separated solids. The acid and iron containing solution is recycled and the oxidized separated solids are washed with an acid wash solution which is recycled to the acidic pretreatment step 20 , whilst the washed solids are recovered for subsequent processing, e.g. by cyanidation, to recover the gold.
