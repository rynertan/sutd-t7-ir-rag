# Improvements in digital magnet recording.

## Abstract
In a system for retrieving data from a recording medium employing MFM or FM encoding forms, a decoding method and circuit employs the technique of delaying the third harmonic of the data signal relative to the fundamental of the data signal by 180 degrees. This delaying is effected by the use of two resonant networks H, F each delaying the third harmonic relative to the fundamental by 90 degrees. The delaying technique enables a differentiation stage to be eliminated.
