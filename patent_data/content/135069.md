# COMPOSITE MEMBRANE HAVING A SURFACE LAYER OF AN ULTRATHIN FILM OF CAGE SHAPED ZEOLITE AND PROCESSES FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
A composite membrane having molecular sieve activity and or catalytic activity composed of a porous support of a metal, an inorganic material or a polymeric material and combined with its one surface, an ultrathin film of a cage shaped zeolite composed of a 6 , 8 , 10 or 12 membered oxygen ring window having aluminum or gallium atoms, silicon or germanium atoms, and oxygen atoms as constituent members. The composite membrane can be produced, for example, by the various processes described and claimed herein.
