# POWER GENERATING EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
An alternating current electrical power generating system in which the generator 7 is driven by a prime mover 1 , such as a fluid driven turbine, whose speed may vary, the generator rotor 6 being coupled to the output shaft 4 of a differential drive unit 2 , one input 3 of which is coupled to the prime mover 1 and the other input 10 of which is coupled to a syn chronous generator 13 whose output is fed to a thyristor con trolled variable load 16 .
