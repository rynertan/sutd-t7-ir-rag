## Description
The present invention relates to a superconducting current detecting circuit which may be used as a high sensitive fluxmeter. Further details defining the kind of circuit the present invention is dealing with may be seen from the preamble of the appended claim 1. A known type of a fluxmeter of the said kind is using a Josephson device and is called a superconducting quantum interference device or shortly SQUID fluxmeter. Such a fluxmeter can be a DC SQUID fluxmeter or an AC SQUID fluxmeter. The former type is arranged such that magnetic flux interlinked with a superconducting loop constituted by two Josephson junctions and an inductor is measured by changes in maximum DC superconducting current flowing across the superconducting loop. The latter type is arranged such that magnetic flux interlinked with a superconducting loop constituted by one Josephson junction and an inductor is measured by changes in maximum AC superconducting current flowing in the superconducting loop. In any one of those conventional SQUID fluxmeters, the main component thereof, the SQUID, is constituted by a passive element for detecting magnetic flux interlinked with the superconducting loop. The SQUID employing a Josephson junction is dipped in liquid helium and an output signal from the SQUID is transferred through a distribution cable to measuring and data processing circuits maintained at room temperature. The SQUID acts to measure exceedingly weak magnetic flux, and the output signal of the Josephson device per se is weak, so that the signal transferred from the SQUID to the measuring circuit maintained at room temperature is extremely weak and may be only about 1 µV. Therefore, the sensitivity of the conventional SQUID fluxmeters is limited due to thermal agitation noises at room temperature. A superconducting current detecting circuit comprising the features from the preamble of the appended claim 1 is disclosed in Journal of Applied Physics, 57 11 , June 1985, pages 5078 5080. The said detecting circuit is part of a device for performing a current probing method for superconducting integrated circuits. That device employs a function generator, an amplifier and an integrator and its operation is based on compensating an unknown current to be measured by a feedback current which is proportional to a time averaged voltage across a current pickup gate. The current pickup gate used is a SQUID having two control lines one of which has the unknown current applied thereto. The voltage across the SQUID is amplified and smoothed by the integrator, and the integrator output current is fed back to the other one of the control lines. A similarly structured Josephson ultrahigh resolution sampling system is known from Applied Physics Letters 36 12 , 15 June 1980, pages 1008 1010. With said system first a test signal is triggered. Later on a current pulse and a bias current are added to said test signal. The resulting current is used to control a sampling gate which is formed as a Josephson interferometer and which changes its state only if the sum of the three currents exceeds a threshold value. The output of the sampling gate is used to control the bias current so as to make the sum current equal to the threshold in a repetitive feedback process. Further, in Review of Scientific Instruments, Vol. 53, No. 12, Dec. 1982, pages 1815 1845 there is disclosed a structure for biomagnetic instrumentation for measuring magnetic fields emanating from the human body and other biological systems. In the said structure a SQUID is used to sense the biomagnetic field and special efforts are made to optimize the geometry of the detection coil used in connection with the SQUID. It is the object of the present invention to improve the initially indicated kind of circuit so as to provide a highly sensitive superconducting current detecting circuit of the SQUID type which is not subject to limitations due to external noise. According to the invention, the said object is achieved by means of a superconducting current detecting circuit as indicated in the appended claim 1 preferred developments of the invention are defined in the sub claims. With the present invention, using a DC flux parametron circuit or shortly DCFP circuit , an input current to be detected is compared with a reference current pulse signal from a separately provided reference signal generation circuit. On the basis of the value of said reference current pulse signal when the input current to be detected is coincident with said refrence current pulse signal the value of the input current signal is detected. The DCFP circuit using a Josephson junction is an active switching device operated in liquid helium for transmitting a signal by means of DC magnetic flux to obtain a high circuit gain. The DCFP circuit used is described in detail in pages 48 78 of the 1984 Symposium of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and in papers from the 1985 Symposium thereof, pages 1 13. The said circuit is constituted by an amplifying element having high sensitivity for magnetic flux and is operated at a very low temperature liquid helium temperature such that influence of agitation noise is exceedingly small. The objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in more detail from the following description of preferred embodiments when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of a superconducting current detecting circuit according to the present invention where the whole circuit constitutes a feedback loop. In the drawing, the reference number 101 designates a comparator circuit which is constituted by a DCFP circuit 101a and a current detecting circuit 101b. In the comparator 101, a current signal sensed by a flux antenna 109 and transferred into the comparator 101 through a signal transformer 107 and an input line 110a is compared with a reference signal applied to the comparator 101 through an input line 110b, and a difference between the input current signal and the reference signal is amplified and produced from the comparator 101 as an output thereof. The DCFP circuit 101a is constituted by Josephson junctions 113 and 114, excitation inductors 111 and 112, an excitation line 125, the input lines 110a and 110b, and an output line 124. The current detecting circuit 101b is connected to the DCFP circuit 101a through the output line 124 for detecting a current produced from the DCFP circuit 101a. The reference numeral 115 designates a superconducting quantum interference device used in the current detecting circuit 101b for receiving a gate current I The superconducting quantum interference device 115 is switched when the sum of the two currents, that is, the output current I The reference numeral 102 designates a circuit for generating a reference current signal to be applied to the comparator 101. The reference signal generation circuit 102 is constituted by a decoder 103, an up down counter 104, a D A conversion circuit 105, and an attenuator 106. The decoder 103 is provided for judging the polarity of the reference current signal produced from the comparator 101 and for applying an up signal or a down signal to the up down counter 104 when the polarity is positive or negative respectively. The up down counter 104 is connected to the decoder 103 the contents of which represents a value of the reference signal, the contents being increased or decreased in response to the up or down signal. The D A conversion circuit 105 is arranged to convert the digital signal held in the up down counter 104 into an analog signal. The attenuator 106 is arranged to attenuate a value of the reference signal. The flux antenna 109 is arranged to sense magnetic flux to be measured and to apply an input current signal to the input line 110a through the signal transformer 107. The reference numeral 108 designates a calibration line for calibrating flux sensitivity of the flux antenna 109. Next, operations of this embodiment will be described. In the embodiment, in the feedback loop constituted by the reference signal generation circuit 102 and the comparator 101, the polarity of the output signal from the comparator 101 is judged by the decoder 103, so that a value of the reference signal held in the up dpwn counter 104 is renewed on the basis of the result of judgement by the decoder 103 and the renewed value is fed back to the comparator 101 through the D A conversion circuit 105 and the attenuator 106. Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C are timecharts for explaining the operations of the embodiment. The DCFP circuit 101a is driven periodically as shown by a waveform of Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B shows a waveform of the output signal from the comparator 101. In this waveform, the positive polarity of the output signal means that the input signal is larger than the reference signal while the negative polarity of the same means that the former is smaller than the latter. The decoder 103 renews a value of the reference signal in the up down counter 104 in response to the polarity of the output signal from the comparator 101 at timing as shown by a waveform of Fig. 2C. Here, a value of the reference signal held in the up down counter 104 is increased counted up in the case where the waveform of the output signal from the comparator 101 has a positive polarity, while a value of the reference signal held in the up down counter 104 is decreased counted down when the waveform of the output signal from the comparator 101 has a negative polarity, so that the comparator 101 having an arrangement as shown by Fig. 1 becomes stable when the input signal is coincident with the reference signal applied to the comparator 101. As shown in Fig. 2C, assuming that a value of the reference signal held in the up down counter 104 is N, the value N is increased to N 1 in response to the first pulse of Fig. 2B, further increased to N 2 in response to the second pulse, decreased to N 1 again in response to the third pulse, and increased to N 2 again in response to the fourth pulse. Here, in order to detect the coincidence between the input signal and the reference signal, for example, a value of the reference signal held in the up down counter 104 is monitored so that the coincidence is detected when an upper bit of the reference signal has become stable or unchanged. Then, a value of the reference signal when the coincidence between the input and reference signals has been detected is derived through a signal line 105 . In this control system, a ratio of the output signal to the input signal, that is, a circuit gain, can be made large if an attenuation factor of the attenuator 106 is made large, however, a gain of the feedback loop becomes small, so that the response of the circuit becomes slow. Figs. 3A and 3B are diagrams for explaining the operation of the DCFP circuit 101a of Fig. 1. This DCFP circuit 101a is constituted by a superconducting loop 202 constituted by two Josephson junctions 113 and 114 and two inductors 111 and 112, and an excitation line 125 including a series connection of inductors 111a and 112b magnetically coupled with the inductors 111 and 112 respectively. In the DCFP circuit 101a, an input signal current is applied to the superconducting loop 202 through an input line 201. A difference between the currents flowing in the input line 110a and the output line 110b of Fig. 1 is applied to the DCFP circuit 101a as the input signal current. First, as shown in Fig. 3A, if the input signal current flows rightward in the input line 201 in the drawing, this input signal current flows into one path constituted by the inductor 111 and the Josephson junction 113 and the other path constituted by the inductor 112 and the Josephson junction 114. An excitation current is caused to flow in the excitation line 125 in the direction of an arrow shown in Fig. 3A, so that a circulating current I₁ flows in the superconducting loop 202 by the inductor 111 magnetically coupled with the inductor llla, and the inductor 112 magnetically coupled with the 112b in the direction to cancel magnetic flux generated by this excitation current and as a result the current flowing in the Josephson junction 113 is increased while the current flowing in the Josephson junction 114 is decreased. Then, when the current flowing in the Josephson junction 113 exceeds the maximum superconducting current, the Josephson junction 113 is shifted into a voltage mode, so that the circulating current I₁ which has flowed in the superconducting loop 202 is commutated into a superconducting loop 203, and consequently flows downward in the drawing in a load inductor 204 as shown in Fig. 3A. Next, as shown in Fig. 3B, when the input signal current flows leftward in the input line 201 in the drawing, the input signal current flows into one path by the Josephson junction 113 and the inductor 111 and the other path constituted by the Josephson junction 114 and the inductor 112, so that the input signal current flows from the earth 206 to a node Thus, the input current is amplified by the excitation current flowing in the excitation line 125 and the thus amplified current flows into the load inductor 204 as an output current of the DCFP circuit 101a. In this case, the flowing direction of the output current is determined depending on the flowing direction of the input current. That is, this DCFP circuit 101a performs such an operation that the input signal is amplified by the excitation current the excitation electric power in the positive or negative direction determined depending on the polarity of the input signal acting as a pilot signal. Next, referring to Figs. 4A and 4B, description will be made as to the superconducting quantum interference device 115 used as a current detector in the 101b of Fig. 1. Fig. 4A shows a circuit arrangement of the superconducting quantum interference device 115, in which two Josephson junctions 402 and 403, and two inductors 400 and 401 constitute a superconducting loop. A gate current is applied to the superconducting loop through the gate line 123. Two control lines 124 and 122 are provided in the vicinity of the superconducting loop. The respective magnetic flux generated by the currents flowing in the control lines 124 and 122 are interlinked with the superconducting loop, so that the currents on control lines 124 and 122 control the maximum superconducting current of the superconducting quantum interference device 115. Further, a dumping resistor 404 is connected to an output of the superconducting quantum interference device 115. In the superconducting quantum interference device 115 in the current detecting circuit 101b, a current I Figs. 5A and 5B show a way how to use the DCFP circuit 101a as a comparator. The circuit shown in Fig. 5A is arranged such that a reference signal transformer 501 and an input signal transformer 502 is connected in series with the input line 201 of the DCFP circuit 101a of Fig. 3. A difference between the input current received through an input line 504 and reference current received through a reference signal line 503 is applied to the DCFP circuit 101a as input current thereto and the input current is amplified by the excitation current on the basis of the direction of this input current acting as a pilot signal. Fig. 5B shows another way how to use the DCFP circuit 101a as a comparator. The circuit shown in Fig. 5B is arranged such that a reference signal transformer 501 and an input signal transformer 502 are connected in parallel to the DCFP circuit 101a through input lines 505 and 506 respectively. A difference signal between an input signal received through an input line 504 and a reference signal received through an input line 503 is applied to the input line 201 of Fig. 3 as an input signal to thge DCFP circuit 101a shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 6 shows another embodiment for the formation of a feedback loop. In the embodiment of Fig. 6, an output current I An excitation frequency component f Fig. 7 shows the output characteristics of the lock in amplifier 811. The output of the lock in amplifier 811 is positive, negative or zero when the reference current I It is preferable to dispose the whole or a part of the resistor 805 in a place of an exceedingly low temperature for example, in liquid helium in order to suppress thermal agitation noises at a room temperature. In the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 6, the feedback is performed on the basis of the characteristics of Fig. 7 so that the input current I Figs. 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D, and 8E are for explaining the operations of the superconducting quantum interference device 115 and the sampling and holding circuit 810 shown in Fig. 6. The DCFP circuit 101a is driven by a positive unipolar pulse current from the excitation current source 801 as shown in Fig. 8A, and simultaneously, the superconducting quantum interference device 115 is excitated by the positive unipolar pulse current I In the embodiment of Fig. 6, unlike the embodiment of Fig. 1, it is not necessary to effect digital adding subtracting operations because all the signal processings are performed in an analog mode. Therefore, in the superconducting current detecting circuit of Fig. 6, it is possible to cover a wide signal frequency region and to respond to high speed signals. Fig. 9 shows a further embodiment of the superconducting current detecting circuit according to the present invention. This embodiment has a feedback circuit constituted by Josephson devices, and employs an accumulative operation circuit of the type in which a circulating current is accumulated in a superconducting loop. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide an elongated cable for connecting devices disposed in a place of an exceedingly low temperature to devices disposed in a place of a room temperature, so that it is possible to eliminate a time delay due to an elongated cable. The circuit shown in Fig. 9 is constituted by a pickup coil 11 for sensing magnetic flux to be measured, a DCFP circuit 101a, and an accumulative operation circuit 28 constituted by a first and a second DC current source 24 and 26, a first and a second superconducting quantum interference devices 19 and 20, and an inductor 14. A flux magnetic signal sensed by the pickup coil 11 is applied to the DCFP circuit 101a through flux coupling between windings 12 and 13 of a transformer 29. The DCFP circuit 101a is driven by an excitation current periodically applied from an AC current source 15 through an excitation line 125, and the direction of an output current I The output current I Fig. 10 is a diagram for explaining the principle of the accumulative operation circuit 28 used according to the present invention. In this accumulative operation circuit 28, a gate current I Next, the operation of the accumulative operation circuit 28 shown in Fig. 10 will be described. If the inductance value of the inductor 14 is large, most of the gate current I As apparent from the expression 1 , the circulating current I Figs. 11A and 11B show the operating points of the first and the second superconducting quantum interference devices 19 and 20, respectively. Each of the drawings is a characteristic diagram showing a so called threshold characteristic of a superconducting quantum interference device for distinguishing the operation mode between a superconducting mode and a voltage mode from each other. In the embodiment of Fig. 9, the value of the maximum superconducting current of each of the two Josephson junctions 402 and 403 of the superconducting quantum interference device shown in Fig. 4A and the inductance value of each of the two inductors 401 and 400 are selected in an optimum manner. For example, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 9, the characteristics of the Josephson junctions and the inductors are selected so that the first and second superconducting quantum interference devices 19 and 20 have a rightward up threshold characteristic and a leftward up threshold characteristic with respect to the control current, as shown in Figs. 11A and 11B respectively. The superconducting quantum interference devices 19 and 20 are supplied with gate currents I In the case where the output current of the DCFP circuit 101a is detected in the current detecting circuit 101b employing a superconducting quantum interference device 115, an error operation may be caused by the influence of this current detecting circuit 101b so that a signal polarity of the DCFP circuit 101a is inverted to destroy information. Accordingly, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of the current detecting circuit 101b. The influence of the current detecting circuit 101b is as follows. That is, the current for example, the gate current I In this circuit arrangement, a cancelling current I Fig. 12B shows a circuit arrangement of another method of eliminating the influence on to the DCFP circuit, in which two current detecting circuits are differentially operated. That is, the circuit of Fig. 12B is arranged such that two current detecting circuits 115a and 115b are connected to the DCFP circuit 101a as a load thereof so as to perform a differential operation such that the gate current I Although only one DCFP circuit is used in the comparator in the foregoing embodiments, a plurality of DCFP circuits may be connected in series to each other so as to constitute the comparator. According to the present invention, it is possible to derive a weak flux signal into measuring and processing devices disposed in a place of a room temperature, after the flux signal has been amplified in liquid helium. Thus, a high sensitive fluxmeter which is not affected by thermal agitation noises is effectively constituted by the DCFP circuit according to the present invention. This fluxmeter is useful for the measurement of a weak magnetic field, for example, for the measurement of magnetic field generated in a human body.
