# PURE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, ITS PREPARATION AND USE

## Abstract
The invention provides the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in a novel, purer and more active form than hitherto known, characterized by a number of physical and chemical prop erties. This novel pure alkaline phosphatase is obtainable from e.g. ruminant entestine material by a monoclonal antibody purification method. The invention also provides antibody pure alkaline phosphatase conjugates and reagent test kits based upon the enzyme linked immunoassay method comprising the pure alkaline phosphatase.
