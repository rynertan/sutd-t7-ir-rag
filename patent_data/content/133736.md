# Di enzymatic dentifrice.

## Abstract
A di enzymatic dentifrice is provided which contains an oxidizable substrate and an oxidoreductase enzyme specific to such substrate for producing hydrogen peroxide upon oral utilization of the dentifrice and further contains a thiocyanate salt and lactoperoxidase for interacting with hydrogen peroxide to produce a hypothiocyanate bacterial inhibitor. The concentration of lactoperoxidase is at least about 2 of the concentration of the oxidoreductase enzyme, in Interna tional Units, to thereby limit the ratio of hydrogen peroxide to lactoperoxidase during oral utilization of the dentrifrice. An illustrative enzymatic system for this purpose contains glucose, glucose oxidase, potassium thiocyanate and lac toperoxidase.
