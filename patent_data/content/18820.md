# Ducted propeller aircraft.

## Abstract
For quiet and efficient operation of an aircraft having a lift producing mainplane 14 , a prime mover 29 , a propeller 13 driven by the prime mover for flight and an annular shroud 11 defining a duct 33 surrounding the propeller 13 , the duct 33 has its upstream end so located relative to the mainplane 14 that it is unimpinged upon by any portion of the turbulent airflow emanating from the mainplane, and the shroud 11 serves as the or a primary load path along which torsional and bending stresses to which the mainplane 14 is subject in use are passed between the portion of the mainplane to the port side of the shroud and the portion of the mainplane to the starboard side of the shroud.
