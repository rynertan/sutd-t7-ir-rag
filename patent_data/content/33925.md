# FORMING FABRIC

## Claims
Endlose Formgewebe oder Sieb für Papierherstellungs , Zellulose oder ähnliche Maschinen, wobei das Gewebe oder Sieb aus einer Lage von ersten Fäden 1 , die in Längsrichtung verlaufen, in der sich das Gewebe in der Maschine bewegt, sowie einer Lage von zweiten Fäden 2 besteht, die quer zur Längsrichtung verlaufen, wobei die ersten Fäden 1 an einer ersten Stelle zwischen zwei benachbarte zweite Fäden 2 hinunter geführt werden und an einer zweiten Stellen zwischen zwei andere zweite Fäden 2 wieder hinauf geführt werden, wobei jeder erste Faden 1 zwischen den beiden Stellen über zumindest zwei zweite Fäden 2 läuft, wodurch die Siebfläche grösser als die Flächensumme der Projektionsflächen der Fäden auf eine Ebene wird, die parallel zum Sieb liegt, dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass die ersten Fäden 1 von der oberen Ebene des Siebs zwischen den beiden Stellen versetzt sind, die somit in Längsrichtung des Gewebes beabstandet wird, dass die zweiten Fäden 2 aus einem stark schrumpfbaren Material bestehen und einen grösseren Durchmesser besitzen als die ersten Fäden 1 , wobei die zweiten Fäden 2 nach dem Weben des Siebs einem Schrumpfverfahren unterworfen werden und die ersten Fäden 1 nahe nebeneinander angeordnet sind, wodurch zwischen den beiden Stellen Hohlräume 3 ausgebildet werden.

## Description
This invention relates to a forming fabric or a screens for paper making, cellulose and similar machines, which fabric or screen consists of one layer of first threads going in the longitudinal direction in which the fabric is moving in the machine and one layer of second threads going In the transverse direction to said longitudinal direction, said first threads being passed down in a first point between two adjacent of said second threads,,and being passed up again in a second point between another two of said second threads, each of said first threads passing over at least two of said second threads between said two points, whereby the area of the screen is larger than the sum of the areas of the protected areas of the treads onto a plane parallel with the screen. A screen of above mentioned type is known from DE A 1 611 765. The object of the invention is to produce a screen, which has a better draining capacity in combination with good retention properties than this known type of screens. The screen according to the invention is hereby characterized in that the first threads are offset from the upper plane of the screen between the first and second points, which thus are spaced in the longitudinal direction of the fabric, and in that the second threads are of highly shrinkable material and have greater diameter than that of the first threads, whereby the second threads have passed a shrinking operation after the screen being weaved, the first threads hereby being placed close together and cavities being formed between said two points and two first threads. The known art also teaches the effort to arrange the longitudinal threads of a one layer screen as straight as possible in order to reduce the tendency of extension of the screen in a paper machine. This tendency will not appear for the screen according to this invention and specifically not if the longitudinal threads are arranged to clsoe to each other in the screen by that the transversal threads are of very highly shrinkable material having larger diameter than the longitudinal threads, which should be relatively thin. An embodiment of the invention will be described in the following with reference to the enclosed drawing. The drawing is a longitudinal section through a screen of a forming fabric of the one layer type. A part of a longitudinal section through a screen can be seen from Figure 1. One of the longitudinal threads is denoted by 1 and the thread behind is denoted by 1A. The transversal threads are denoted by 2. A certain inter space volume exists normally, which means such a volume which is not occupied by threads. In the screen in the Figure, the inter space volume has been increased by forming particular hollow pockets 3. These pockets are formed by that the longitudinal threads 1 and 1A intentionally have been drawn down into the fabric. It shall be pointed out that the thread 1A is shown only for better understanding. In order to reduce the tendency of the fabric to be extended in the paper machine, the longitudinal threads have been closely packed together in the screen by that the transversal threads are of highly shrinkable material having a larger diameter than the longitudinal threads, which shall be comparatively thin. A screen made in this manner will not be extended more than the conventional screens, which have straight longitudinal threads when the screen is completed. The theoretical free are of a screen can be calculated. It can be calculated in percent of the total area of the screen. The free area is thus the area which not is occupied by threads. The so called interspace factor or the degree of porosity P can also be calculated for a screen. This factor is the interspace volume in percent of the total volume of the screen. The quotient between the interspace factor and the theoretical free area P F is similar to or greater than 4, 9 for the screen shown in the Figure. By keeping this quotient high one will get a screen having high draining capacity in combination with good retention properties. The high draining capacity is achieved by making the screen so that a high degree of porosity is achieved. Screens according to the invention shall have a porosity which is greater than 60 . In order to that the screen shall have the other characterisitcs according to The invention the free area thereby shall be less than or similar to 12.24 . In order to compare with four different conventional one layer plastic screens, a table is shown for four screens. The known art teaches to move the longitudinal threads sideways, whereby also airpockets are formed in the screen. This is thus another way of alter the interspace volume of a screen. Such a screen has not, however, a high draining capacity in combination with good retention properties of such a degree, which is attained with this invention and calculations have for instace shown that it is possible to achieve a factor P F which is 4.77, which is a value below the one for 4.9 stated above. This has been said in order to show, that a small change of the value of said quotient means very much for said qualities of the screen which according to the inventive idea is aimed. It has been said above that the longitudinal threads are drawn down in the screen and this can be done by using a certain way to weave. It is also possible to pull down the longitudinal threads by shrinking the transversal threads.
