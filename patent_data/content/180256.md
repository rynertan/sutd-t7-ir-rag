# Method of manufacturing contacts on a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
For providing semiconductor zones 16, 18, 26 and con tact metallization 19, 27 within an opening 9 in a self re gistered manner, which opening is provided along its edge with polycrystalline connection parts 10 which are sep arated by an insulating material 15 from the metallization 19, 27 , a protective layer 11 is formed which is maintain ed within the opening 9 until within this opening 9 the said connection parts 10 are formed by anisotropic etching from a uniform layer of polycrystalline semiconductor ma terial 10 . The method is suitable for the manufacture of both bipolar transistors and field effect transistors.
