# RADIATION INTERCEPTION COIL

## Abstract
A radiation and ion interception coil formed of a copper rod of desirable size and cross section wound in a clockwise direction to form a helix with a plurality of proximate turns of constant diameter with a pole on each end of the coil. Disposed within the coil is another rod with poles on each end, the pole on the lower end being adapted to be submerged in a liquid when the coil is placed about the neck of a bottle.
