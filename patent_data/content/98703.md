# LIFTING AND LOWERING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A lifting and lowering mechanism for a car seat includes a pair of fore and aft position adjusting sliders 12, 13 on the upper one of which a seat 11 is supported on legs 15, 16 pivoted at the ends of front and rear bell cranks 17 pivoted at 21 to the upper slide 12 . The other arm of the bell cranks is connected at 23 to opposite ends of a strut 24 which can be clamped in any longitudinal position by a clamping mechanism 31, 32 . A height adjusting handle 46 when moved in either sense, first releases the clamp and then lifts or lowers the seat by moving the strut 24 forwardly or rearwardly to rotate the bell cranks. After release of the handle the lock re engages in the new position of the strut and the new height of the seat.
