# Composition and method for forming a protective coating on carbon carbon substrates.

## Abstract
In accordance with the invention, a composition of mat ter is provided for forming a coating for protecting carbo naceous substrates from degradation at elevated tempera tures. The composition of matter is a mixture of particulate silicon, silicon carbide and alumina. The mixture contains between about 40 and 50 silicon by weight of the total composition, between about 30 and 50 silicon carbide by weight of the total composition and between about 20 and 30 alumina by weight of the total composition. A method is provided for forming a primary protective coating on carbonaceous substrates utilizing the aforesaid mixture. An enhancement coating is provided for sealing the primary coating in applications where the substrate will be subject ed to elevated temperatures and temperature cycling.
