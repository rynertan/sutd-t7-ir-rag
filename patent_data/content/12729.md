## Description
PRODUCT WITH CHOLERETIC ACTIVITY. AND THE THERAPEUTiC COMPOSITIONS WHICHCONTAIN IT AS ACTIVE PRINCIPLEThis invention relates to the use in human therapy of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 naphthyl acetic acid of formulaEMI1.1 alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 naphthyl acetic acid has already been prepared J. Chem. Soc. 2799 2805 1969 during the course of a purely chemical study of ss hydroxy acids.No possibility of direct industrial or human therapy use for this compound has ever been indicated.It has now been quite unexpectedly found that compound I has strong cho leretic activity accompanied by very low acute toxicity and by the absence of chronic toxicity during prolonged administration at therapeutic doses, and this forms the subject matter of the present invention. In compa prison with the best known oholereticsX compound I represents considerable and unforeseeable progress from many aspects.It is known that the primary effect of a choleretic agent is to increase the bile flow and the quantity of solid substances excreted with the bile.A good choleretic must provide this effect in a sufficiently intense and prolonged manner. In addition, as in the case of all drugs, it must have low acute toxicity and good general tolerability, but in particular must be free from toxic effects on the organ on which it is required to act, i.e. the livers whether this is in a normal or pathological state. The analysis of the new product in comparison with the best known products for the same therapeutic use has therefore been focused on these aspects.The choleretic activity of the new product has been determined in the rat by using the bile fistula method. We star rats of both sexes and having a weight of between 180 and 240 g were used.The animals, which were kept fasting for 12 hours but with free access to water, were narcotised by ethyl urethane in a dose of 1 g kg by intra peritoneal or intramuscular injection.After binding the animals to the retention bed, a median laparatomy was carried out, and when the bile duct had been isolated a cannula needle was inserted into it. A polythene tube was then inserted into those ani mals which were to receive the products intraduodenally, after which a su ture was carried out on the abdominal wall, and the bile was allowed to discharge for 30 minutes after inserting the cannula in the bile duct, so as to allow the discharge to become normal. The bile was then collec ted for one hour.Having determined the volume of bile discharged during this first hour of collection base volume , the products under examination were administered at the predetermined doses and by the predetermined methods. The bile excreted by the individual animals was then collected over each hour for a further six hours. During the experiments, the animals were kept at ambient temperature of about 220C, and at regular intervals of two hours received 10 ml kg of physiological solution s.c.The liquids were administered at a temperature of 370C, The bile flow and cholesterol excretion were determined on those bile fractions excreted by the animals over each hour starting from the base hour until the end of the experiment.The dry residue redo was determined on the bile fraction excreted dur ing the base hour and on the total bile fractions excreted during the sub sequent hours. For practical reasons, the determination of the dry residue and of the cholesterol carried out by the Sperry Webb method were carried out on the pool of bile excreted by the entire group of animals subjected to the same treatment instead of on the bile fractions excreted by the individual animals which was sometimes insufficient for determining the cholesterol .The new choleretic aocording to the invention was administered in its pu re state, as the sodium salt of alpha methyl alpha 3,r dihydro 1 naphthyl acetic acid symbol 1.620 in aqueous solution, and as a formulation of the following composition 1.620 100 mg lactose 80 mg sodium stearate 20 mgSaid formulation1 indicated for the brevity by the symbol CO was administered in lYo gum arabic mucilage.The following were used as comparison products dehydrocholic acid in the form of an aqueous solution of its sodium salt alpha 4 hydroxy 4 phenylcyclohexyl butyric acid also in the form of aque ous solution of its sodium salt, and dihydroxybutylether in the form of an aqueous emulsion.For the controls, a physiological solution or gum arabic mucilage was used in the same volumes as used for administering the drugs.In a first series of experiments, an evaluation was made of the effect of the compound 1.620 administered orally at progressive doses on choleresis, on the bile flow and on the dry residue R.S. . The results obtained are shown in Table 1.The values given are mean values s.e. for groups of ten animals.For comparison purposes, the same determinations were repeated with dehydrocholic acid also administered orally in progressive doses and with two different choleretics of current therapeutic use1 namely i 1 hydroxy 4 phenylcyclohexyl butyric acid and dihydroxybutyletherThe results of this series of experiments are given in Table 2, in terms of the mean value s.e. of tests carried out on groups of ten animals0In the tables, the bile flow is expressed in ml kWh and the dry residue in mg ml and in mg kg h.The action of the new compound 1.620 on choleresis flow and R.S. was also determined by intraduodenal administration of increasing doses, in comparison with dehydrocholic acid administered in the same way.Mean values s.e. for groups of 10 animals are given in table 3.

For this calculation, the following formula was used EMI11.1 whereCn and C n represent the choleresis in ml kg h for the bile flow, and in mg kg h for the dry residue determined over the considered time interval for the group of treated animals and the group of controls respectively.Cb and C2b represent the base choleresis in the group of treated animals and group of controls respectively.The graphs of Figure 1 show the increase in bile excretion over the controls, for rats treated with 1.620 in various orally administered doses.In the graph A, the abscissa indicates the time in hours from the administration of the drug. The ordinate indicates the percentage increase in the bile flow. The curves I, II, III, IV relate respectively to doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg kg of 1.620.In graph B, the white columns indicate the percentage increase in the bile flow at said increasing doses of 1.620, in the first hour after treatment, and the hatched columns indicate the increase in the dry residue in the same period and at the same doses. The graph C indicates in the same way the percentage increase over the en tire period of six hours following treatment0The graphs A, B, C of Figure 2 give the same evaluation as graphs A, 3, C of Figure 1, but for intraduodenal administration of 25 mg kg I 50 mg kg II and 100 mg kg III of compound 1.620. In Figure 3 graphs A,B,C give the same evaluation as previously described, but for the oral administration of 25 mg kg I 100 mkg II , 200 mg kg III and 400 mg kg of dehydrocholic acid.Finally, graphs A, 3, C of figure 4 give the same evaluations for the oral administration of 200 mg kg of dihydroxybutylether I and of 200 mg kg of alpha 1 hydroxy 4 phenylcyclohexyl butyric acid II .The duration index has also been calculated for the new choleretic product 1.620 in comparison with dehydrocholic acid, alpha 1 hydroxy 4 phenyl cyclohexyl butyric acid and dihydroxybutylether.This index was calculated as the time for halving the maximum choleresis increase recorded under their effect.The results are shown in Table 4 TABLE 4Treatement Peak chloreresis Duration index time of appearance increase 1620 200 mg kg p.o 2nd hour 135 240 Dehydrocholio acid 1st hour 94 45 alpha 1 hydroxy 4 phenylcyclohexyl butyric acid 1st hour 105 180 Dihydrixydibutylether 1st hour 49 45 In a second series of experiments on rats, the superimposability of the reponses of 1.620 administered alone, as in the previous tests, and of the same compound administered in the complete speciality formulation as CO was tested, and in addition a comparison was made with scalar do ses of dehydrocholic acid and alpha 1 hydXoxy 4 phenylcyclohexyl butyric acid.The results are shown in Table 5 and on the graphs of Figure 5.On these graphs I 25 mg of 1.620 administered gastrically as CO II 25 mg of pure 1.620 administered gastrically III 50 mg of 1.620 administered gastrically as CO IV 50 mg of pure 1.620 administered gastrically V 100 mg of 1.620 administered gastrically as CO VI 100 mg of pure 1.620 administered gastrically.The abscissa axis represents time in hours from administration of the drug, and the ordinate axis represents the cumulative flow expressed as a percentage of the base flow.

The increases were calculated relative to the controls and expressed as a percentage of the base values.In Figure 6, curve I relates to the bile flow, curve II to the dry resi due and curve III to the total cholesterol.The DL50 for the alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid 1.620 determined in the mus musculus had the following values DL50 by oral administration 1663 1451 1905 mg kgDL50 by i.p. administration 1883 1226 1559 mg kgThe determination in the rat gave the following values DL by oral administration 1720 1520 1921 mkg 50 DL50 by i.p. administration 1339 1270 1744 mg kgLarge doses of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid 1.620 which were many times greater than those obtainable in therapy, iOeO do ses of 50 mg kg die administered for 180 consecutive days to the rat were well tolerated and were free from effects on the main organs, systems and functions.The organ tolerability with regard to normal livers livers subjected to the action of inducing and hepatotoxic drugs, and livers strongly traumatised as a result of partial hepatoectomia was excellent. All the aforesaid results were confirmed in the dog and agree with the clinical results obtained .The single human therapeutic dose per kg of body weight has been determined as 1.66 of 1.620, and the human therapeutic dose per kg of body weight per day has been determined as 4.99 mg of 1.620.The following conclusions can be drawn from the total research carried out on the new choleretic product and of which only some significant da ta have been given heretofore. 1 In the most common laboratory animals rat, mus musculus and dog , the new product has a very low acute, sub acute and chronic toxicity, because of which it is well tolerated orally its normal method of human clinical administration , even at large doses which are many times greater than those recommended or attainable in clinical practice.2 The local tolerability of the product by the gastroenteric mucosa appeared satisfactory in the albina rat and dog, even for repeated admini strations over 180 consecutive days at doses which per kg and per day were many times greater than the human therapeutical doses.3 The new product proved to be well tolerated by a normal liver, by a liver subjected to inducing drugs phenobarbitone or hepatoxic drugs car bon tetrachloride, allyS alcohol ,0C naphthyl isothiocyanate , and by a liver strongly traumatised by partial hepatectomia, even at doses which are considerably greater than the therapeutic dose. In addition, it gives rise to no significant pressor, respiratory or ecgraphic modifications, or modifications of the VNS relative to the cardiovascular system nor any does it have significant depressive or stimulating effects on the CNS.4 The new product has choleretic effects characterises by considerable intensity and in particular by long duration, these being considerably greater than those observed for dehydrocholate and other synthetic khole retics of current therapeutic use.5 In addition to its choleretic effect, the new product has moderate laxative effects and an undoubted cholesterol lowering and antidislipidemic action0 According to the results of certain tests, it also seems aTh to reduce the aocumulation of cholesterol and hepatic triglyceridesO The elevated biligenetic activity of the new product enables the desired pharmacological effect to be obtained by smaller dosages than those common ly used in the case of other choleretios, and which are far removed from doses which could cause toxio effeots, by virtue of the low toxicity of the drug.The elevated biligenetic activity of the drug derives not only from the intensity of its action, which is greater than the greater duration of the biligenetic affect in particular.This is particularly useful at the applicational level, in that it enables an effective increase in the bile fluid to be obtained which is better di stributed over the entire period of time during which it is desirable that it should occur i.e. during the two to three hours corresponding to the average gastric emptying time after a regular meal.In addition to the choleretic effect1 the mild laxative effect is advanta geous for therapeutic reasons, as it is capable of reducing the stypsis which normally occurs during bile insufficiency, and the protective effect against hepatio steatosis is also advantageous, and on which the deficit in the biligenetic function can at least partly depend.The perfect tolerability by the organ concerned in the biligenetic func tiont in addition to the low acute and chronic toxicity, constitute further advantages in the clinical use of the new choleretic product0 alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl ascetic acid, the new and unforeseeable therapeutic use of which is the subject matter of the present invention, has been prepared starting from tetralone and a i bromopropionate by way of the following reaction schemeEMI19.1 in which R is a linear or branched alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms0The first stage is carried out by heating to boiling point a solution of the two reagents in an inert organic solvent in the presence of zinc fi lings.The reagents are mixed in proportions which are preferably stoichiometric, but at least close to stoichiometric. v few iodine crystals can be added to the solution in order to accelerate the initiation of the reaction.The solution is kept boiling for approximately a further hour after the end of the exothermic stage.After the solution has been cooled, it is washed first with dilute H2S04, then with a solution of sodium bicarbonate and finally with water.The ester of alpha methyl alpha 1 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 1 napthyl ace tio acid is then separated by distillation.To carry out the second stage of the process1 the ester thus separated is dissolved in 9 ffi formic acid and is kept for 30 60 minutes over a boi ling water batheAfter the solution has been cooled it is repeatedly extracted with benzene or an equivalent organic solvent , and the benzene extracts are di stilled under vacuum to give the ester of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 naph thyl acetic acid,Finally, alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid is released from the ester by alkaline hydrolysis, preferably with alcoholic soda or potash, under reflux.The free acid is separated from the cooled and acidified solution by cry stalli sation. One working example is described hereinafter in order to provide all the operational details and facilitate reproduction of the process according to the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 Ethyl ester of alpha methyl alpha 1 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 1 naphthyl acetic acid from 4 tetralone and ethyl 1 bromopropionate 15.7 g 0.24 moles of zinc filings are suspended in 170 ml of anhydrous benzene. 38 g 0.21 moles of ethyl alpha brompropionate are added, and the mixture is heated under agitation until boiling begins. 29.2 g 0.2 moles of tetralone are then dripped in, while controlling the addition and heating in such a manner as to maintain the mixture under strong but not fierce boiling. The addition of a few iodine crystals can accelerate the reaction, should it proceed too slowly.When the exothermic stage of the reaction ceases, boiling under agitation for bne hour. The mixture is cooled1 the benzene solution is decanted to leave behind the unreacted zinc, and is shaken with about 800 ml of 0.5 N H2SO4 cooled to 5 C. The extraction is repeated with a further portion of dilute H SO if an 24 aqueous extract does not give a clearly acid reaction. The benzene phase is then washed by shaking with 100 ml of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and then with water. It is then dehydrated with sodium sulphate and is then distilled under vacuum, with firstly the benzene distill ing off then the residue1 and that fraction of the residue which passes over in the range 130 140 C at 0.5 mm Hg is collected. Approximately 35 g of crude ethyl ester of alpha methyl alpha 1 hydroxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 1 naph thyl acetic acid are obtained, and after further distillation under vazuum, appear as a colourless liquid having a boiling point of 1360C at 0.5 mm Hg.

It is cooled, poured into water cooled to 50C, and then extracted firstly with 100 ml and then with 50 ml of benzene. The benzene extracts are collected and shaken with 50 ml of a saturated solution of sodium bicar bonate, then with 50 ml of water.The benzene solution is dehydrated with sodium sulphate and is then distilled under vacuum, with firstly the benzene and then the residue distilling over, and that fraction of this latter which passes over in the range of 115 1250C at 0.3 mm Hg is collec ted.About 20 g of the crude ethyl ester of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 naphthyl acetio acid is collected, and when purified by further distillation under vacuum appears as a slightly yellow coloured liquid having a B.PO of 119 120 C at 0.3 mm Hg.C calculated 78.22 found 77.98 II 7.88 7.90 3 alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid from the ethyl ester of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid 23 g 0.1moles of the ethyl ester of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid are dissolved in 213 ml of 5 6 aqueous ethanol containing 6.8 g 0.17 moles of NaOH. The solution is kept under reflux for 4 hours, is then cooled, brought to pH 8 with concentrated HCl, and the alcohol is then evaporated under vacuum. The residual alkaline solution is diluted with an equal volume of water, treated with 2 of decolourising carbons filtered and acidified carefully under cooling with the necessary quantity of concentrated HCl. An oil separates which rapidly transforms into a solid mass, which is then collected at the pump and crystallised firstly from 70 ethyl al cohol and then from ligroin. Approximately 14 g of alpha methyl alpha 3,4 dihydro 1 napthyl acetic acid are obtained in the form of white orystals having a M.P. of 114 1160C. C calculated 77.20 found 77. 13 H 6.98 U 7.18
