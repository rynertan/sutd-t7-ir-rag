## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A POLYAMIDE This invention relates to a ne process for preparing a copolyamide comprising polymerizing an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile, water and a lactam. The preparation of a polyamide from acrylonitrile and water is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,629,203 and 3,499,879. The ring opening addition polymerization of caprolactam is also known and is carried out by adding a catalytic amount of water to open the ring and then later removing the water at an elevated temperature.Surprisingly, we have now found that although these polymerizations proceed by different mechanisms the alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile, water and lactam can be polymerized together to form a copolymer under the appropriate reaction conditions. The process of this invention results in high yields of a copolyamide which has particularly good physical properties. Moreover, the percent water insolubility and the structure of the resultant copolyamide can be varied by varying the reaction conditions. We have found that copolyamides can be prepared by a process comprising polymerizing an alpha, betaunsaturated nitrile, water and a lactam. More particularly, it has been discovered that a copolyamide containing both three carbon and six carbon carbonamide repeating units can be prepared by polymerizing acrylonitrile and water with a molar excess of caprolactam. According to the invention there is provided a process for producing a copolyamide comprising polymerizing an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile and water with a molar excess of a lactam. The copolyamides obtained by the process of the invention are generally defined as containing carbonamide repeating units as follows EMI2.1 wherein R is a suitable substituent and n is 2 11. Each copolyamide will contain at least two different carbonamide repeating units. Preferred copolyamides are those wherein R is hydrogen and n is 2 and 5. The copolyamides of this invention can be polymerized with other monomers and or resins. These monomers and or resins are selected from the group consisting of polyamides such as nylon 3, nylon 4, nylon 6, nylon 6,6, nylon 6,10, nylon ll, nylon 12, or monomers thereof such as ammonium acrylate esters such as methyl acrylate unsaturated acids or salts thereof and vinyl monomers such as acrylamide. The properties of the copolyamides obtained by the process of the invention vary depending upon the amount and identity of the monomers used and the reaction conditions. The preferred polyamides are melt processable without decomposition and highly crystalline. The process according to the invention involves copolymerization of an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile, water and a lactam. Any alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile can be polymerized in accordance with the invention. . The preferred nitriles contain less than 40 carbon atoms and are represented by the following formula EMI2.2 wherein each R1 is independently hydrogen or a C1 30 alkyl group. More preferred nitriles are those wherein each R1 is independently hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group. Examples of these nitriles include acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. Any lactam can be used as a comonomer in the process of the invention. The preferred lactams contain less than 40 carbon atoms and can be represented by the following formula EMI3.1 wherein x is 3 to 11 and wherein each R2 is independently hydrogen or a Cm 30 alkyl group. More preferred lactams are those wherein x is 3 to 5 and R2 is hydrogen or a c14 alkyl. Examples of these lactams include caprolactam and pyrrolidone. This process according to the invention works best when a molar excess of the lactam is present.Theoretically, all that is needed for the polymerization is one mole of lactam per mole of acrylonitrile and water.However, it has been found that at equal molar ratios, the copolyamide formed has a low molecular weight and takes a long time to form. Therefore, the molar ratio of the nitrile to the lactam is preferably less than 1 to 1, more preferably less than 0.5 to 1. The third monomer component is water. The ratio of the nitrile to the water is preferably about 1 to 1. Other monomers or polymers can also be polymerized with the nitrile, water and lactam in this process,For example, ammonium acrylate, a nylon 3 monomer, can be polymerized with the nitrile and lactam to produce a copolyamide. Since one mole of water is generated when one mole of ammonium acrylate is polymerized to a polyamide, it is only necessary to add enough water so that there is a total of one mole of water, from the ammonium acrylate polymerization and from the added water, for every one mole of the nitrile. Preferably, the molar ratio of the nitrile to the ammonium acrylate is approximately 1 to 1, and thus it is not necessary to add any water. In this monomer system, the ratio of the nitrile to the lactam can vary widely and ratios of less than 1 to 1 can be used to prepare copolyamide.It is preferred to use a ratio of less than 1 to 2. For the purposes of this invention, any ammonium salt of an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid can be used instead of the ammonium acrylate. The process of the invention can be conducted under a broad range of process conditions. It is important to maintain suitable contact between the monomers so that the desired polymerization can occur. Although suitable contact time can be established when the monomers are in the solid, liquid or gaseous phase, it is preferred to perform the polymerization in the liquid phase.This liquid phase can be obtained by various methods including the use of solvents0 In carrying out the process it is preferred that the monomers be maintained at a temperature above their melting points but below the decomposition temperature of the monomers or product polymers, which is generally 0 about 350 cho It is more preferred to conduct this process at a temperature between 1250C and 2500C, and conducting the process between 15OOC and 2000C, is most preferred. The time required for the polymerization process according to the invention will depend upon various process parameters. For example, at low temperatures it will take longer for the copolyamide to form than at high temperatures. In general, the reaction is conduc ted in less than 48 hours with times ranging from 8 to 24 hours normally being adequate to produce polymers. Although the monomers can be polymerized in contact with the atmosphere, a more desirable group of copolyamides having high intrinsic viscosities and molecular weights are obtained by carrying out the polymerization in the absence of oxygen. This can be achieved by blanketing the reaction mixture with either an inert gas such as nitrogen or with gaseous ammonia. The polymerization according to the invention can proceed at atmospheric, superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressure. Preferably, the monomers are heated under superatmospheric pressures. It has been found that at pressures such as O to 5,000 psig 350 kg cm2 2 are preferable with 50 to 2,000 psig 3.5 to 140 kg cm being most preferable. The polymerization process of this invention can proceed by any of the generally known modes of polymerization including bulk, slurry, suspension or solution polymerization by batch continuous or intermittent addition of the monomers and other components. It is often convenient to carry out the process of the invention in the presence of a diluent which may also be a solvent to the monomers, products or both.Inert diluents which can be used in the process of this invention include hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene ethyl benzene, solvent naphtha, n hexane, cyclohexane, isooctane and decalin ether such as dioxane, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether and dimethoxy ethane aromatic halogenated compounds such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. In addition to these organic solvents, an anhydrous solvent such as liquid ammonia may also be used. The polymerization conditions have a large effect on the physical properties of the resultant copolyamide. Lower polymerization temperature, increased polymerization time and catalysts favour the formation of a copolyamide containing higher percentages of a carbanamide comprising three carbons. Increased polymerization time favours formation of higher molecular weight copolyamides. Certain catalysts have been found to be effective in the process of the present invention. These catalysts comprise tertiary amines such as tripentylamine and tripropylamine. At the end of the polymerization, the unreacted monomers are removed from the reaction mass by suitable means e.g. distillation, extraction with a solvent or mixture of solvents or by combination of such techniques.The unreacted material may be removed in conjunction with removal of low molecular weight polymers, if desired. Any suitable solvent or mixture of solvents may be employed in purifying the crude reaction product.The reaction of the solvent is more or less selective.If the polymerization reaction is carried out in the inert organic diluent in which the polymer is insoluble, the polymer will precipitate and may be removed by filtration, centifigation, etc. The polymer which is obtained may easily be purified by extracting it with a liquid that is a solvent for the monomer but which is not a solvent for the polymer. Frequently, water is used for this purpose. The polymers produced according to the invention have a wide variety of applications. Generally, they may be used in any application calling for a polyamide. For example, these copolyamides can be used as fibres, plastics, films and molding resins. The following examples illustrate the invention.In each of the examples, the polymer formed was identified by various analytical techniques as a copolyamide. Example 1 The monomers, acrylonitrile and water and caprolactam, were charged into a 1 litre non stirred autoclave reactor in a molar ratio of 1 1 2. The autoclave was purged with nitrogen for 2 nrinutes and then pressurized. The polymerization proceeded for 2 hours 0 0 at 160 C and then for 22 hours at 210 C. The reactor was cooled and opened and the polymer was broken into small pieces and then water extracted for 24 hours.The water insolubility was found to be 42.4 and the polymer comprised 20 3 carbon carbonamides and 80 6 carbon carbonamides.Examples 2 8 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated.
