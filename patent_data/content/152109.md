# Microcomputer driven fail safe device with short circuit detection for electronic control circuitry.

## Abstract
A fail safe device for removing power from controlled circuitry upon the occurrence of an undesired operating condition is disclosed. The fail safe device includes means for detecting a short circuit in the controlled circuitry and for indicating the existence of an undesired operating condition if a short is detected. The fail safe device further includes a non volatile memory for retaining data through a power outage so that the existence of an undesired operating condition is remembered upon return of the power. The data stored in the non volatile memory may also be useful in investigating an accident or malfunction. The fail safe device still further includes a reset button which returns power after an undesired operating condition if it is momentarily de pressed.
