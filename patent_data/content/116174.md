# Wire like structure twisting machine.

## Abstract
A wire twisting machine for twisting individual wire like structures into a cable, having a plurality of bobbins around which are wound the wire like substance to be twisted, the bobbins being mounted on individual cradles which are supported at either end by disks secured to a common spindle, comprising a drive mechanism having prime movers which are external to the bobbin cradle assembly for controlling the speed of feeding the wire like structure from its respective bobbin, thus resulting in constant wire like structure tension, and another drive mechanism for controll ing cradle rotation for fixing or adjusting the amount of twisting back in said cable.
