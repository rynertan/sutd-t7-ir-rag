# LOW RESISTANCE BURIED POWER BUS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
In a channel 12 formed in one surface of a semiconduc tor substrate 10 having a first conductivity, e.g. N type, a layer of material 14 having a second conductivity type, e.g. P type boron, and a layer of relatively low resistance material 20 such as Tungsten in contact with the first layer 14 but insulated from the substrate 10 . Second conductivity type tubs 28 and the like can be formed adjacent the bus 18 and in direct contact therewith through the first layer 14 .
