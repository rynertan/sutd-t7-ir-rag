# SYNTHESIS OF ZEOLITE ZSM 5, REACTION MIXTURE THEREFOR AND PRODUCT THEREOF

## Abstract
A synthetic crystalline ZSM 5 zeolite material has the X ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as set forth in Table I of the specification, and has, as synthesized and in the anhydrous state, a formula, in terms of mole ratios of oxide, as follows 0.02 10 R₂O 0.1 2 M The zeolite material is prepared from a reaction mixture which comprises sources of an alkali or alkaline earth metal, alumina, silica and an organic, anionic directing agent repre sented by the above formula and which has the following com position in terms of mole ratios and oxides SiO₂ Al₂O₃ 30 1000 H₂O SiO₂ 2 1000 OH SiO₂ 0 10 M SiO₂ 0.01 3 R SiO₂ 0.01 3 wherein M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal and R is the anionic directing agent, the reaction mixture being maintained at crys tallization conditions until the crystals of the ZSM 5 zeolite are formed.
