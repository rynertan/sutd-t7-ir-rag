# Method and apparatus for gathering rings of wire rods into coils.

## Abstract
Rings of wire rod are continuously dropped from a conveyor to around sail in a gathering tub to gather together into coil form. A formed coil is delivered from the gathering tub to an adjacent down ender. When a given quantity of rod rings has been coiled together, the sail is divided into two segments, and a first segment continues to gather together the rod rings incessantly supplied from the conveyor into the next coil while a second segment carries the formed coil to the down ender. Upon completing the delivery to the down ender, the second segment returns to the original position where it incorporates with the first segment con tinuing coiling to make up the sail again. The first segment coils the rod rings while guiding them with at least three planes circumferentially separated from each other.
