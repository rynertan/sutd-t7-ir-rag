## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory and particularly to a dynamic semiconductor memory referred to hereinafter as a dynamic RAM of a redundant design. Fig. 2 is an equivalent circuit diagram of a memory cell array of a conventional dynamic RAM shown in the journal of the Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan Vol. 67, No. 11, pp. 1151 1160 . In the figure, bit lines BL1 through BLi are provided so as to be perpendicular to word lines WL1 through WLn and a dummy word line DWL. On the other hand, bit lines At the positions where the word lines WL and Each of the above described memory cells MC comprises a MOS transistor 5 and a storage capacitor 6. The drain of each MOS transistor 5 is connected to a bit line BL or Each of the above described dummy memory cells DC comprises MOS transistors 7 and 9 and a dummy capacitor 8. The drain of each MOS transistor 7 is connected to a bit line BL or Each of the above described sense amplifiers SA comprises MOS transistors 3 and 4. The drain of each MOS transistor 3 is connected to a bit line BL, the gate thereof is connected to a bit line Now, referring to a timing chart in Fig. 3, the operation of the memory cell array shown in Fig. 2 will be described. First of all, the MOS transistors 13 are turned on by the clock signal 2 so that all the bit lines BL and Then, an X address row address is latched by an Ext. On the other hand, a Y address column address is latched by an Ext. The above described operation is the reading operation from the memory cells MC. Writing operation is performed reversely. More specifically, a voltage corresponding to the input data is applied to the bus lines I O and In such a memory cell array as described above, the bit lines BL and The above described phenomenon a bounce of V Analyses and measures to be taken concerning erroneous operation due to a bounce of V For example, if the timing of a bounce of the substrate potential V This problem becomes serious particularly in precharging a spare decoder used for a redundant design which tends to be adopted for the purpose of improving the yield according to the trend to a large capacity of a dynamic RAM. Spare decoders are described in detail in the document A Fault Tolerant 64k Dynamic RAM Digest of Technical Papers, 1979, IEEE, ISSCC, pp. 150 151 , and this document discloses a spare Y decoder of the type shown in Fig. 4, and the timing chart thereof shown in Fig. 5, the structure and the operation of a conventional spare Y decoder as well as the problems involved therein will be described. The spare Y decoder shown in the figure is provided apart from a regular Y decoder 21 and is structured so that a decoded output for example Yi is provided only when a Y address corresponding to a defective address the address of a defective memory cell detected beforehand by a test is applied thereto. As shown in Fig. 4, the spare Y decoder comprises five MOS transistors 15 for receiving a Y address YA0 to YA4 at the gates thereof and five MOS transistors 15 for receiving at the gates thereof a complementary Y address signal On the other hand, a MOS transistor 14 for charge is provided between a power supply line Vcc and a node N2. A clock signal 3 is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 14. The node N2 is connected to the above stated node N1 as well as to the gate of an output MOS transistor 18 through a MOS transistor 17. The power supply line Vcc is connected to the gate of the MOS transistor 17. One conductive electrode of the MOS transistor 18 receives a clock signal Y. From the other conductive electrode thereof, a decoded output for example Yi is obtained. Now let us assume that either the fuse 16 or the fuse 16 for each bit of the Y address is melted in advance by a laser light or the like. In consequence of this, the Y address based on which the spare Y decoder is to operate is programmed. For example, if the Y address YA0 to YA4 corresponding to the defective address is 1, 1, 0, 1, 0 the complementary Y address The nodes N1 and N2 are charged by the MOS transistor 14 before a Y address is applied thereto. If the Y address applied thereto after that is not the programmed address, the MOS transistor 15 or 15 corresponding to the bit not coincident with the programmed address is turned on and the nodes N1 and N2 are grounded whereby the potential at the nodes N1 and N2 are lowered. As a result, the MOS transistor 18 is not turned on and a decoded output is not obtained. On the other hand, if the input Y address is the programmed address, that is, the address corresponding to the defective address, the MOS transistors 15 and 15 are all turned off and the potential at the nodes N1 and N2 is maintained. Consequently, the MOS transistor 18 is turned on and the clock signal Y is obtained as a decoded output Yi. The decoded output thus obtained serves to forbid the selection of memory cells by the regular Y decoder 21 and to select memory cells provided as spare ones not shown in the memory cell array. As compared with the regular Y decoder 21, the spare Y decoder further comprises the MOS transistors 15 and the fuses 16 and 16 . As a result, the spare Y decoder can not be contained in the memory cell array according to the pitches of layout of the regular Y decoder 21 and is usually located outside the memory cell array. In consequence, a parasitic resistor 19 having a large value exists between the nodes N1 and N2. The MOS transistor 14 for charging the nodes N1 and N2 is generally connected to either end of the parasitic resistor 19. A problem caused in such a case will be described referring to the timing chart in Fig. 5. As shown in the timing chart in Fig. 5, the timing of rise of the clock signal 3 and the timing of bounce of the substrate potential VBB in the positive direction occur almost simultaneously if the rise of the signal Ext. The worst condition is that charging by the clock signal 3 occurs after the bounce of the substrate potential and in this worst condition, the potential of the node N1 is not sufficiently increased and is maintained at Vcc VTH. After the charging, the potential of the node N2 is absorbed by the node N1 through the parasitic resistor 19. Since the potential of a node N3 is also connected to the node N2 through the MOS transistor 17, the node N3 is not sufficiently charged and remains at Vcc VTH as in the case of the node N1. At the subsequent cycle, the clock signal 3 falls and the sense amplifiers are activated to bounce the substrate potential V In Fig. 5, the solid lines represent the waveforms in case where the spare Y decoder is selected and the broken lines represent the waveforms in case where the spare Y decoder is not selected. In case where the spare Y decoder is selected, the nodes N1, N2 and N3 are not discharged and the clock signal Y is applied to the MOS transistor 18. The potential of the node N3 is increased by the self bootstrap effect due to the gate capacitance of the MOS transistor 18 and the MOS transistor 18 is intensely conducted whereby the decoded output Yi of the spare Y decoder rises. However, if the potential of the node N2 is lower than Vcc VTH, the MOS transistor 17 is conducted and the potential of the node N3 is gradually lowered. Then, the decoded output Yi of the spare Y decoder is lowered due to various leakage currents and the like and the ON resistance between the MOS transistors 10 and 11 connecting the bit lines BL and Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a semiconductor memory which can operate stably with a wide margin of application of timing. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory of a redundant design, comprising Thus, the nodes of a spare decoder can still be charged rapidly even if the timing of the charging is not optimal, and therefore a semiconductor memory capable of operating stably with a wide margin of timing can be obtained. These features, aspects and advantages of the present invention all become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a spare Y decoder in a semiconductor memory in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is an equivalent circuit diagram of a memory cell array of a conventional dynamic RAM. Fig. 3 is a timing chart for explaining the operation of the memory cell array shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram showing a conventional spare Y decoder. Fig. 5 is a timing chart for explaining the operation of the spare Y decoder shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a spare Y decoder in a semiconductor memory in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The same reference characters as in Fig. 4 denote the same portions. A feature of this embodiment resides in that a MOS transistor for charge is further provided. The structure of the other portions is the same as in the circuit shown in Fig. 4. The MOS transistor 20 for charge is provided between the power supply line Vcc and the node N1. A clock signal 3 is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 20. Since the MOS transistor 20 for charge is further provided in the spare Y decoder of this embodiment, the node N1 can be charged directly by the MOS transistor 20 instead of using the MOS transistor 14 and the parasitic resistor 19 as in a conventional example. Accordingly, if the rise of the clock signal 3 and the bounce of the substrate potential VBB in the positive direction occur concurrently, the node N1 can be charged rapidly in the same manner as in the node N2. More specifically, the potential of the node N3 to be charged can be sufficiently assured since the charging capacity is increased and in addition, since the potential of the node N3 increased by the self bootstrap effect is not lowered at the time of selection and the potential of the decode output Yi of the spare Y decoder can be maintained for a long period, writing in and reading out of the bit lines can be performed easily and a wide margin of application of timing in operation can be assured. Although an example using two MOS transistors for charge was shown in the above described embodiment, the MOS transistors for charge may be 3 or more. In brief, it is the best way to provide a MOS transistor for each node to be charged. In addition, although an NMOS structure was shown in the above described embodiment, a PMOS structure or a CMOS structure may be adopted. In such cases, clock signals and power supply lines may be changed suitably. Further, although an example of a spare Y decoder provided with a plurality of charging transistors was shown in the above described embodiment, a wide timing margin of operation can also be assured if a spare X decoder is provided with a plurality of charging transistors.
