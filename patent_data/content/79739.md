# ALBUMIN BASED NUCLEOTIDES, THEIR REPLICATION AND USE, AND PLASMIDS FOR USE THEREIN

## Abstract
The DNA sequence coding for human serum albumin has been isolated and inserted as two fragments into two novel plasmids which can be replicated in E. coli. These novel fragments can be joined to provide a unitary DNA sequence which then can be cloned into a suitable host, e.g. E. coli, for the expression of human serum albumin which is used extensively in medical practice in treating shock conditions .
