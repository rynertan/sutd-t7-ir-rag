# Elastomeric coated roll and method and apparatus for making the same.

## Abstract
The invention contemplates a thin and uniformly applied elastomeric coating for a cylindrical roll, in mass produced volume. A succession of like vertically oriented cylindrical rolls 12 is conveyed along an endless path of movement 10 which includes a segment A that is cylindrically arcuate about a vertical axis of electrostatic spray disc rotation. A solvent mixture of elastomeric ingredient material is continuously applied to the rotating disc B while the latter is vertically oscillated over the length of the rolls 12 and while the rolls 12 in the segment A are continuously rotated about their individual axes. The path of movement includes a course which leaves the segment and later rejoins the segment, after passage through a zone of partial curing, the cycle being repeated for multiple pass building to desired coating thickness.
