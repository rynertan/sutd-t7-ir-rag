# Biphenylene end capped quinoxaline polymers and their use as insulating coatings for semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
An insulating or masking film for semiconductor devices formed by curing applied coatings of biphenylene end capped quinoxaline polymers. The synthesis of such polymers comprises the step of end capping quinoxaline prepolymers with biphenylene groups by reacting terminal ortho diamines with 1,2 diketones. 7
