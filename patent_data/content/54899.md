# Air film conveyor for transporting semiconductor chips.

## Abstract
This transport system contains an air film shuttle conveyor 10 for conveying semiconductor chips 26 from a loading 20 to an unloading station 30 , the conveyor comprising a base plate 42 and upstanding side walls 48 extending longitudinally of the base plate, the side walls being spaced apart a distance slightly greater than the lateral dimension of said chips further included are means providing a laminar air flow which surrounds the chips and forms an air film sup porting them and propelling them downstream such that the slight spacing between the chips and the side walls causes the flow resistance to be higher in the one regions defined by said slight spacing than in the region defined by the spacing between the chips, whereby a continuous and flexible separation action occurs be tween the chips.
