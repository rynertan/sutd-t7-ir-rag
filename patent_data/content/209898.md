# Film flow packing.

## Abstract
A film flow packing 22 for apparatus performing heat and material exchanges between a liquid and a gaseous medium, particularly for cooling towers and degassing units, comprises, in a manner known per se, juxtaposed cooling sheets 20 with fluid conducting channels e.g. 26a having parallel medial lines 30 is improved by that the channels e.g. 26a are of sinuous shape e.g. 28a , and mutually opposite channels e.g. 26a and 26b are offset with respect to one another while, in a projection at right angle to the cooling sheets 20 , the channels e.g. 26a intersect and form a sys tem of interconnected passages. The useful surface of the improved packings 22 amounts to 180 to 250 square meters per cubic meter in distinction to the value of 100 to 150 square meters per cubic meter of conventional packings. This is due to crossings 32 of the channels e.g. 26a which offer uniformly distributed points of mutual support and bonding of the cooling sheets 20 of a packing 22 .
