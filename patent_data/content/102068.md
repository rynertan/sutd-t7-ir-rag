# Method of and apparatus for controlling output power of nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A method of controlling the output power of a nuclear reactor core in which an output power distribution in the core is controlled with the use of an output power controlling means for controlling control rods, a flow of coolant or a concentration of neutron absorbing substance. Core data is calculated to include an output power distribution and a burn up degree distribution in a fuel assembly, in accord ance with detected data of the controlling means. Fuel rod data, which includes a temperature distribution, a stress distribution, a strain distribution and a concentration of fission products in a fuel rod, is calculated in accordance with the core data. Then, a failure event probability in the fuel rod is calculated in accordance with fuel rod data, the failure event probability being correlated with the history of the fuel rod concerning stress corrosion, strain and fatigue of the fuel rod. The soundness of the fuel rod is determined by comparing the failure event probability with a set value. According to this method, it is possible to start up a unclear reactor at a power increase rate while observing the soundness of the fuel rods.
