## Abstract
A method of producing a web of interconnected plastics bags 27 by providing a tubular foil of plastics material with gusset folds with bottom fold part seals 21, 22, 23, 24 at both sides of the tubular foil. Each fold part seal 21, 22, 23, 24 connects a gusset fold part 5, 6, 5a, 6a with an opposite part of the outer foil layers 1a and 1b. Immediately after having moved the tubular foil over a predetermined distance the tubular foil is provided with a first transverse bottom seal 12 by heatsealing opposite first fold part seals 21, 22, 23 and 24, and outer foil layers 1a and 1b to each other.
