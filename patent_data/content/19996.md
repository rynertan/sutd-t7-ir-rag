# Process and device for manufacturing multicoloured detergent bars.

## Abstract
Multi coloured detergent bars can be manufactured by extruding detergent material through a mutti apertured plate in a detergent plodder and injecting a visually distinctive liquid at the plate. The liquid is distributed throughout the detergent material in the form of striations as the material is compressed in the extrusion cone. A specific form of external striping and the use of increased amounts of injected liquid can be achieved by having some of the apertures positioned peripherally on the plate. These apertures form walls of extruded materials which constrain the liquid into stripes. The manufactured bar has a distinctive appearance because the external striations are wider than the internal striations.
