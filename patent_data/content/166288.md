# Liquid crystal bistable storage device.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal storage device includes a smetic phase liquid crystalline medium 24 in spaced relationship with at least three separated electrodes, the first 12 of which pro vides a ground plane and is in contact with the liquid crystal medium, the second electrode 14 , spaced from the first elec trode, is arranged in a mesh like or finger electrode configura tion 14A, 14A , being likewise in contact with the liquid crystal medium and the third electrode 18 is spaced by a dielectric medium 16 from the second electrode 14 , such third elec trode being in either orthogonal or parallel relationship with the second electrode. Voltages are selectively applied to each of the second and third electrodes such that the stable stage of the liquid crystalline layer is changed from the ordered homeo tropic or clear state, to the disordered focal conic or dark state.
