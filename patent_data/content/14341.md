# Integral medical electrode and skin preparation device.

## Abstract
A medical electrode adapted to be secured to the skin and is designed to prepare the skin is disclosed. The electrode is employed to prepare the skin by penetration of the epidermal layer of the skin in contact with the conductive means of the electrode after the electrode is secured in place on the skin. The electrode includes penetrating means 24 associated with conductive means 16 capable of transmitting biopotential events for recording. The conductive means 16 is retained by holding means 14 securing the electrode to the skin of the patient. The penetration means 24 in contact with the skin is movable relative to the skin of the patient and holding means by an applicator gun 70 to penetrate the epidermal layer of skin after the electrode is placed on the skin. Uniform skin preparation achieved by the electrode and applicator gun minimizes motion artifacts arising from skin potential varia tions.
