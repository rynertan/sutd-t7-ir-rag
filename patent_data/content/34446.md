# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO AMINOFIBRES

## Abstract
A fibre and method of making the fibre. The fibre consists at least in part of a cationic amino formaldehyde resin and may also include a carrier material which is a water soluble fibre forming polymer. Fibres can be made by a wet spinning method. An aque ous solution of the resin is mixed with an aqueous solution of polvinyl alcohol to form a spinning solution and the spinning solution is extruded into a coagulation bath to form a fibre, which is dried and cured. The cationic amino formaldehyde resin comprises the reaction product of a triazine, optionally urea, and formal dehyde and a compound, such as di or tri ethanolamine to render the resin cationic. It may be mixed with another cationic amino formaldehyde resin, e.ga cationic urea formaldehyde resin, in the making of the fibre.
