## Description
Bicyclic S Lactam Antibacterial Agents, Their Use in Pharmaceutical Compositions, Processes for their Preparation and Intermediates for Use in Such Processes R. B. Woodward Acta Pharm. Suecica 1977, 14 Suppl., p 23 25 disclosed that the compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 where R was an unspecified group possessed antibacterial activity. No aid in determining the nature of the group R was given by Professor Woodward nor did he describe the preparation of any compounds of the formula I . However, at the symposium on Current Topics inDrug Research Uppsala, Sweden October 1977 ProfessorWoodward described the compound of the formula I wherein R is a hydrogen atom. We have prepared this compound and found it to possess a somewhat disappointing degree of antibacterial activity.Clearly it would be desirable to find a class of compounds that possess a better degree of activity especially against Gram positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.Such a class of compounds has now been found. Accordingly the present invention provides the compounds of the formula II EMI2.1 and salts and cleavable esters thereof wherein R1 is aOH, OR2, OCOR3, O.CO.OR4, O.S02R5, N3 or NH2 group wherein R2 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group or an aralkyl group R3 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group R4 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group and R5 is a lower alkyl group, or a tolyl group. When used herein the term lower alkyl means an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms such as the methyl and ethyl groups, When used herein the term aryl means a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by a halogen atom or an alkoxyl group of 1 or 2 carbon atoms. When used herein the term lower aralkyl means a lower alkyl group substituted by an aryl group. When used herein the term substituted lower alkyl means a lower alkyl group substituted by a methoxyl, ethoxyl, acetoxyl, amino, acetamido, benzyloxycarbonylamino, benzyloxycarbonyloxy or hydroxyl group of which the amino and hydroxyl groups must not be attached to the carbon atom. Very favourably R1 is a hydroxyl group as resulting compound of the formula 111 EMI3.1 and its salts and cleavable esters serve as intermediates as well as biologically active substances. Preferably R1 is amino as the resulting compounds have particularly good antibacterial properities, for example against Pseudomonas. Suitable values for R2 include the methyl, ethyl, benzyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 2 aminoethyl, 2 acetor methyl 2 methoxyethyl, acetoxymethyl, methoxymethyl, and meth ne sulchonyl croups. Suitable values for R3 and R4 include those listed as suitable for R2 and the phenyl group. Suitable values for R include the methyl 5 and p tolyl groups. Such compounds are intended primarily as intermediates, for example in the preparation of the compounds in which R1 is N3. The azide is also envisaged primarily as an intermediate in the preparation of the corresponding compound in which R1 is NH2. It is believed that the compounds of the formula II or their salts are the antibacterially active species and that biologically cleavable esters thereof act as pro drugs. Thus in one favoured aspect this invention provides the compounds of the formula II wherein R1 is as hereinbefore defined and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Non pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula II also form part of this invention since they may be used as chemical intermediates, for example in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts by ion exchange. Thus suitable salts of the compounds of the formula II include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts and salts of nitrogenous bases.Particularly suitable salts of this invention include the sodium and potassium salts. Antibacterially active esters of the compounds of the formula II are believed to be those cleavable by in vivo hydrolysis to the compounds of the formula II or their salt. Such esters may be identified by administration to a test animal such as a rat or a mouse by intravenous administration and thereafter examining the test animals body fluids for the presence of the compound of the formula II or its salt. Suitable esters of this type include those of the part formulae a and b CO O CHA1 O CO A2 a EMI4.1 where A1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, A2 is an alkyl or alkoxyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, A3 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or methoxyl group and A4 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or methoxyl group.Other esters of the compounds of the formula II of interest are those cleavable by chemical methods as described hereinafter. Ihis invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula 11 or a salt or cleavable ester thereof which comprises the ring closure with elimination o the elerr.ents of triphenyl phos2hineoxide from a cleavable ester of the compound of the formula IV EMI5.1 in which the hydroxyl group is optionally protected and thereafter removing the optional protecting group and a cleaving the ester to yield a compound of the formula III or a salt thereof or b converting the hydroxyl group into a OR2, OCOR3, OCOOR4.OS02R5, N3 or NH2 group and if desired cleaving the ester of the resulting compound of the formula II to yield the compound of the formula II or a salt thereof. The adaption of the preceding process to the preparation of the compound of the formula III or a salt or cleavable ester thereof is a preferred process aspect of this invention. The ring closure reaction may be carried out on cleavable ester of a compound of the formula IV or on a corresponding compound in which the hydroxyl group is protected for example by silylation to form a tertbutyldiphenylsilyloxy group. In general the ring closure is effected by heating in an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include inert aromatic solvents such as toluene and temperatures of 60 1200, for example 1000, may be employed. The cyclised product may be obtained by evaporation of the solvent and thereafter purified chromatographically if desired. If a tert butyldiphenylsilyl group has been used as a protecting group this may be removed by reaction with anhydrous fluoride ion, for example as provided using a solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. The resulting ester of the compound of the formula III may be obtained from the reaction mixture by dilution with ethyl acetate, washing with water and evaporation of the organic layer. The cleavable ester of the compound of the formula IV may be obtained by the following reaction sequence EMI7.1 In the preceeding sequence R is a group such that C02R is a cleavable ester group. Suitable cleavable ester groups include those removable by hydrogenolysis and these removable by hydrolysis. Esters conventionall removable by hydrogenolysis include substitutzd benzyl esters, such as the nitrobenzyl esters of wch the p nitrobenzyl ester is preferred. Such esters may be cleaved by hydrogenation, for example using palladium on charcoal as catalyst. Particularly suitable esters for removable by hydrolysis include silyl esters such as the trimethylsilyl, tertbutyldiphenyl sii l and the like esters. The tertbutyldiphenylsilyl ester is particularly apt as it is readily cleavable by treatment with fluoride ion. In a further suspect this invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula III or a sa .t thereof which comprises the hydrogenation of the p nitrobenzyl ester of the compound of the formula III optionally in the presence of base. The hydrogenation reaction may employ an approximately atmospheric pressure of hydrogen using a palladium catalyst such as palladium on charcoal, for example 5 palladium on charcoal. Conventional hydrogenation solvents may ba used such as dioxane and water, for example a 4 1 mixture. The initially produced compound of the formula III may be neutralised by reaction with a base which may be durirg the hydrogenation or introduced thereafter. Suitable bases include LiCO3, LiOH, Na2C03,NaHC03, KHC02, Ca OH 2, MgO or the like. The desired salt may be obtained by diluting with a water immiscible solvent and extracting the salt into water. Evaporation of the aqueous solution yields the desired salt. Purification may be effected chromatographically, for example over Biogel P2. Further esters of the compound of the formula III may be prepared by esterifying a salt thereof, such as its sodium salt, with a reactive halide such as a bromide or chloride, for example phthalidyl bromide. Such reactions may be performed at ambient temperature in a conventional solvent such as dimethylformamide. The general procedures leading to the preparation of cleavable esters of the compound of the formula III will be closely analogous to those set out in the Examples hereinafter for the preparation of the p nitrobenzyl ester of the compound of the formula III . The cleavable esters of the compound of the formula III may be converted into the corresponding cleavable ester of a compound of the formula II wherein R1 is a OCOR3, OC02R4 or O.S02R5 group wherein R37 R4 and R5 are as defined in relation to formula II by reaction with a corresponding compound of the formula V , VI or VII X. CO.R31 V X. C02R4 VI X.S02R5 VII wherein X is a good leaving group and R3Ú and R4Ú are groups R3 and R4 as defined in relation to formula II in which any reactive group is protected and R5 is as defined in relation to formula II and thereafter removing any protecting group present in R3 or R4Suitable values forX include C1, Br,and, for VI and VII , Ú and 0C02R41.Suitable protecting groups which may be employed in R31 or R41 include the benzyloxycarbonyl and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl groups which may be removed by hydrogenation. In general the reaction of the cleavable ester of the compound of the formula III will take place in the presence of an acid acceptor such as collidine, pyridine, triethylamine, potassium carbonate or the like.The reaction is normally effected at a non extreme temperature, for example 0 50 C in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or the like. The cleavable esters of the compound of the formula III may be converted into the cleavable ester of a compound of the formula II , wherein, R1 is an OR2 group where R2 1 a group 1 as defined in relation to is R2 formula II wherein any reactive group is protected which process comprises reaction with an etherifying agent such as an alkylhalide in the presence of silver ions, a diazocompound in the presence of boron trifluoride, an epoxide, an acylatedaziridine or the like and thereafter removing any protecting group present.Such etherifications may be effected in aprotic solvents such as dichlcromethane or the like at a depressed or ambient temperature, for example 750 to OOC. Suitable protecting groups include benzyloxycarbonyl and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl groups which may be removed by hydrogenation. The cleavable esters of the compound of the formula II wherein R1 is a N3 group may be prepared by the reaction of an ionic azide with a cleavable ester of a compound of formula II whereinR1 is a OS02R5 group. Suitable solvents for such reactions include polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide. The reaction is normally carried out at a depressed temperature such as 400 to OOC. The compound of the formula II whereinR1 is a NH2 group may be prepared by hydrogenation of a benzyl or p nitrobenzyl ester of the compound of the formula II wherein R1 is a N3 group. Particularly apt cleavable esters of the compounds of the formula Il for use in the substitution reactions include esters cleavable by hydrogenation such as the benzyl and p nitrobenzyl esters. Such esters may be cleaved by hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium, for example palladium on charcoal. High, low or medium pressures of hydrogen may be employed but in general an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen has been favoured.The hydrogenation is conventionally carried out in a suitable solvent such as optionally aqueous ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or the like.
