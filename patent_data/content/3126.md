# A process for preparing impact resistant, high melt flow polycarbonamides and a process for producing articles from these polycarbonamides.

## Abstract
In the impact modification of polycarbonamides, the incompatibility of acrylic core shell impact modifier with low molecular weight nylon is overcome by forming an impact modifier concentrate of impact modifier and high molecular weight nylon which concentrate is then mixed with a larger amount of low molecular weight nylon so as to modify its impact resistance properties.
