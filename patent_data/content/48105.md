# High speed wrapping machine.

## Abstract
A machine for packaging objects such as rolls or multiple rolls of paper during their high speed passage through the machine in a continuous motion generally in a single direction and substantially at a single speed. A wrapper supply mechanism feeds sheets of wrapping mate rial 91 to lie between conveying belts above the objects 53 to be wrapped with the leading edge of the wrapper substantially ahead of the objects to be wrapped. A pair of vacuum wheels 95 alongside the path of the products on axes skewed slightly outwardly from the product path pull the wrapper 91 down in front of the product and allow it to pass underneath as the product passes so that the wrapper becomes wrapped around the top, front and bottom of the product. Specialized belts and rollers below the periphery of a the vacuum wheels assist in smooth transfer of the wrapper without permitting wrinkles at that very high speed. The product is then transferred from the belt conveyor to bars 120,121 above and below the product, with chain driven paddles 122,125 to propel the product and to wrap the upper and lower portions of the tail of the wrapper 91 about the rear of the product while at the same time differences in the coefficient of friction between the upper and lower bars snug the wrapper about the product and close any spaces between articles in a group. The ends of the wrapper are folded in and the ends and rear seam are sealed, continuous ly to produce wrapped products.
