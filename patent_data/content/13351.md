# Method and apparatus for determining the weight of molten metal in situ.

## Abstract
A method for rapid and accurate weight determination of molten metal in a slag containing bath by the addition to the molten bath of a known weight amount of a trace element preferably of a type which is completely diluted in the molten metal, to the practical exclusion of the slag awaiting the even dispersal of the trace element in the molten metal aiding the speed of dispersal by promoting a boiling action, if necess sary taking a sample of the molten metal analyzing the sample to determine the weight percent of trace element in the molten metal for example by spectrometric analysis and determining the weight of the metal from the known values of weight of the trace element added and its weight percent in the molten metal after addition. An apparatus for measuring the weight of molten metal or of slag in a slag containing bath is disclosed, comprising means for determining the weight of a trace element, means for determining the weight percentage s of said trace elf ment in the metal and or in the slag, means for processing the weight and the weight percentage determinations from the foregoing means to generate a signal indicative of the weight of the molten metal or of the slag.
