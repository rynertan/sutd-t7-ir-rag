# Photoresist composition containing a novolak resin.

## Abstract
A positive type photoresist composition comprises a a novolak resin and b a quinonediazide compound in wt. ratio of 1 1 to 6 1. The novolak resin is obtained by the addition condensation of a phenol and formaldehyde, in one stage by using as a catalyst an organic acid salt of a divalent metal more electropositive than hydrogen, or in two stages by using the acid catalyst in the subsequent stage, the phenol being at least one compound of formula Preferred salts are acetates of Mg, Mn, Zn, Cd, Co, and Pb. NMR spectra are shown of the resins. The composition in solvent is coated on a support, and has a good resolving power.
