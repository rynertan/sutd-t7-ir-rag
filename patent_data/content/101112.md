# Image transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
An image magnifier for an image transfer apparatus comprises a multitude of fibres 2 arranged in laminar fibre arrays 3 . The fibre arrays 3 are superimposed at the entrance face 4 and are disposed at the desired pitch from each other at the exit face 5 . The fibre arrays 3 also extend at a minimal angle to the exit face 3 . In the fibre arrays 3 the pitch of the fibres 2 decreases to the same pitch as that of the fibres 2 at the entrance face 4 within a minimal distance from the exit face 5 , in such a way that the fibres 2 join each other substantially at the level of the orthogonal side 6 of the rectangular exit face 5 . From this location the fibres 2 extend as a strip of parallel fibres in the direction perpendicular to the orthogonal side 7 of the exit face 5 and are subsequently bent towards the entrance face 4 . By thus stacking the fibre arrays 3 the image magnifier has a much smaller depth at the location of these parts of the fibre arrays 3 where the pitch of the fibres 2 changes from the pitch at the exit face 5 to the pitch at the input face 4 than at the location where the fibres 2 are arranged in strips. This smaller depth is utilized in order to accommodate one or more image display devices with associated optics and electronics. The images of the image display devices are presented to the entrance face 4 and can be observed in magnified form at the exit face.
