# Solid state color imager and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A plurality of color filters 1, 2 are disposed on a semi conductor body for a solid state imager including a plurality of photosensitive regions 5, 6, 7 , and a filter of a third color is constructed by the overlapping between the filter mem bers 1, 2 of a first color and a second color. The filter members are formed by a photographic exposure process. One of the filter members 1 which has a spectral transmit tance substantially transmitting the light used for the expo sure for use in forming the filter members 1, 2 is arranged as a lower layer closer to a substrate of the semiconductor body. When the upper filter 2 is formed, therefore, the lower filter 1 has no substantial effect on the exposure light reflected from the semiconductor body, giving a better spectral characteristic to the upper filter.
