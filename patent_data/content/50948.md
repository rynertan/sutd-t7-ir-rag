# Improvements relating to heat exchanging head pieces.

## Abstract
A heat exchanging head piece comprises a head encircling, variably constrictable, heat exchanging headband portion 30 , a top head overlying, contacting and heat exchanging crown portion 36 which is adjustably connectible between front and rear portions of the headband in fitting manner and means for integrating and compacting the entire assembly of heat exchanging headband portion 30 also constricting and heat exchanging crown portion 36 so that the entire scalp zone is somewhat under pressure and compression with greatest constriction at the headband zone and continuous, no holiday, heat exchanging contact over the patient s entire scalp. In a word, absolute maximal heat exchange is provided, with carefully controllable compression and constriction not only over the entire scalp zone but, most particularly, in the critical headband zone where base circulation to the scalp originates and exits. Thus safety and comfort are maintained to the maximum degree yet efficiency is not in any way sacrificed. Other applications without limitation include the cooling of the head in case of certain types of trauma to inhibit bleeding after initial treatment of injury, cold and or heat application to the entire upper head zone in the case of headache or migraine, use in preparation for neurosurgery and the like. The pressure construction option in the headband may be employed or not as required. With or without the later, complete, uniform upper entire head heat exchange may be obtained by use of the heat exchanging head piece in accordance with the present invention.
