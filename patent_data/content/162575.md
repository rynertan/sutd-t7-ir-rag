## Description
The present invention relates to peptides which inhibit the release of gonadotropins by the pituitary gland in mammalians, including humans, and to methods of preventing ovulation and or inhibiting the release of steroids. More particularly, the present invention is directed to peptides which inhibit gonadal function and the release of the steroidal hormones, progesterone and testosterone. The pituitary gland is attached by a stalk to the region in the base of the brain known as the hypothalamus. In particular, follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH , sometimes referred to as gonadotropins or gonadotropic hormones, are released by the pituitary gland. These hormones, in combination, regulate the functioning of the gonads to produce testosterone in the testes and progesterone and estrogen in the ovaries, and they also regulate the production and maturation of gametes. The release of a hormone by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland usually requires a prior release of another class of hormones produced by the hypothalamus. One of the hypothalamic hormones acts as a factor that triggers the release of the gonadotropic hormones, particularly LH, and this hormone is referred to herein as GnRH although it has also been referred to as LH RH and as LRF. GnRH has been isolated and characterized as a decapeptide having the following structure Peptides are compounds which contain two or more amino acids in which the carboxyl group of one acid is linked to the amino group of the other acid. The formula for GnRH, as represented above, is in accordance with conventional representation of peptides where the amino terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl terminus to the right. The position of the amino acid residue is identified by numbering the amino acid residues from left to right. In the case of GnRH, the hydroxyl portion of the carboxyl group of glycine has been replaced with an amino group NH₂ . The abbreviations for the individual amino acid residues above are conventional and are based on the trivial name of the amino acid, e.g. p Glu is pyroglutamic acid, His is histidine, Trp is tryptophan, Ser is serine, Tyr is tyrosine, Gly is glycine, Leu is leucine, Orn is ornithine, Arg is arginine, Pro is proline, Sar is sarcosine, Phe is phenylalanine and Ala is alanine. These amino acids together with valine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, and proline are generally considered to be the common, naturally occurring or protein derived amino acids. Except for glycine, amino acids of the peptides of the invention are of the L configuration unless noted otherwise. There are reasons for desiring to prevent ovulation in female mammalians, and the administration of GnRH analogs that are antagonistic to the normal function of GnRH have been used to suppress or delay ovulation. For this reason, analogs of GnRH which are antagonistic to GnRH are being investigated for their potential use as a contraceptive or for regulating conception periods. GnRH antagonists may also be used for the treatment of precocious puberty and endometriosis. Such antagonists have also been found useful to regulate the secretion of gonadotropins in male mammals and can be employed to arrest spermatogenesis, e.g. as male contraceptives, and for treatment of prostatic hypertrophy. It is desired to provide improved peptides which are strongly antagonistic to endogenous GnRH and which prevent secretion of LH and the release of steroids by the gonads of mammals. EP A 0100218 discloses certain peptides of the structure. We have now developed certain improved peptides which have the amino acid residue D 3PAL or Y D Trp, where Y is NO₂, NH₂, OCH₃, F, Cl, Br, CH₃, N The present invention thus provides peptides which inhibit the release of gonadotropins in mammalians, including humans, and it also provides methods for inhibiting the release of steroids by the gonads of male and female mammalians. The improved GnRH analogs are strongly antagonistic to GnRH and have an inhibitory effect on the reproduction processes of mammalians. These analogs may be used to inhibit the production of gonadotropins and sex hormones under various circumstances including precocious puberty, hormone dependent neoplasia, dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. Generally, in accordance with the present invention, peptides have been synthesized which strongly inhibit the secretion of gonadotropins by the pituitary gland of mammalians, including humans, and or inhibit the release of steroids by the gonads. Accordingly the present invention provides a peptide or a nontoxic salt thereof, said peptide having the formula The peptides of the present invention are analogs of GnRH wherein there is a 1 position substitution of dehydro Pro or β 1 or 2 naphthyl D alanine hereinafter β D 1NAL or β D 2NAL , a 2 position substitution in the form of a modified D Phe, a 3 position substitution in the form of substituted D Trp or D 3PAL, an optional substitution of a diamino acid having not more than 5 carbon atoms in the 4 position, a substitution in the 5 position of Arg, a 6 position substitution and an optional substitution in the 7 position such as Nle, NML, Phe, Nva, Met, Tyr, Try, Cys, PAL and 4F D Phe. Modified D Phe in the 2 position provides increased antagonistic activity as a result of the specific modifications present in the benzene ring. Single substitutions for hydrogen in the ring are made in the para or 4 position, and the substitutions are selected from chloro, fluoro, bromo and nitro, with chloro, fluoro and nitro being preferred. Dichloro substitutions are in the 2,4 or 3,4 positions in the ring. The alpha carbon atom may also be methylated, e.g. C Me 4Cl Phe. The 1 position substituent may be modified so that its alpha amino group contains an acyl group, such as formyl For , acetyl, acrylyl, vinylacetyl Vac or benzoyl Bz , with acetyl Ac and acrylyl Acr being preferred. PAL and D PAL represent the L and D isomers of pyridyl alanine where the β carbon of Ala is linked, preferably, to the 3 position on the pyridine ring. When dehydro Pro is present in the 1 position, a D isomer of a lipophilic amino acid, such as D Trp, D Phe, For D Trp,NO₂ D Trp, D Leu, D Ile, D Nle, D Tyr, D Val. D Ala, D Ser OtBu , β D NAL or imBzl D His is preferably in the 6 position, but D PAL may be used. A substitution in the 10 position of D Ala for Gly is considered optional, along with other substitutions mentioned hereinafter. Because these peptides are highly potent to inhibit release of LH, they are often referred to as GnRH antagonists. The peptides inhibit ovulation of female mammals when administered at very low levels at proestrous and are also effective to cause resorption of fertilized eggs if administered shortly after conception. These peptides are also effective for the contraceptive treatment of male mammals. By β D NAL is meant the D isomer of alanine which is substituted by naphthyl on the β carbon atom, i.e., also 3 D NAL. preferably β D 2NAL is employed, the attachment to naphthalene is at the 2 position on the ring structure however, β D 1NAL may also be used. PAL represents alanine which is substituted by pyridyl on the β carbon atom preferably the linkage is to the 3 position on the pyridine ring. In Y D Trp in the 3 position, single substitutions for hydrogen are made in either the 5 or 6 position, with Y being selected from chloro, fluoro, bromo, methyl, amino, methoxy and nitro, with chloro, fluoro and nitro being preferred. Alternatively, the indole nitrogen may be acylated, e.g. with formyl N The peptides of the present invention can be synthesized by classical solution synthesis or by a solid phase technique using a chloromethylated resin, a methylbenzhydrylamine resin MBHA , a benzhydrylamine BHA resin or any other suitable resin known in the art. The solid phase synthesis is conducted in a manner to stepwise add the amino acids in the chain in the manner set forth in detail in the U.S. Patent No. 4,211,693. Side chain protecting groups, as are well known in the art, are preferably added to Ser, Tyr and Arg when present, as well as to certain of the substituents, and may optionally be added to Trp, before these amino acids are coupled to the chain being built upon the resin. Such a method provides the fully protected intermediate peptidoresin. The intermediates of the invention may be represented X² is hydrogen or a protecting group for the indole nitrogen of Trp, such as benzyl however in many syntheses there is no need to protect Trp. X³ is hydrogen or a protecting group for the alcoholic hydroxyl group of Ser, such as one selected from the group consisting of acetyl, benzoyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tert butyl, trityl, benzyl and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, with benzyl being preferred. Alternatively, when a substitution is made for Ser, X³ may be a protecting group for a side chain amino group, such as Tos, Z or ClZ. X⁴ is hydrogen or a protecting group for the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr, if Tyr is present, selected from the group consisting of tetrahydropyranyl, tert butyl, trityl, benzyl, Z, 4 bromobenzyloxycarbonyl and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB is preferred. X⁵ is a protecting group for Arg such as nitro, Tos, trityl, benzyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, Z and Boc, Tos is generally preferred. X⁶ is hydrogen, a protecting group for Tyr, such as X⁴ or a protecting group for Cys preferably selected from the class consisting of p methoxybenzyl MeOBzl , p methylbenzyl, acetamidomethyl, trityl and Bzl. The most preferred protecting group is p methoxybenzyl. X⁷ may be Gly O CH₂ resin support O CH₂ resin support D Ala O CH₂ resin support Gly NH resin support or D Ala NH resin support and it may be OH, ester, amide or hydrazide either of Gly or D Ala or attached directly to Pro. The criterion for selecting side chain protecting groups for X² X⁶ is that the protecting group should be stable to the reagent under the reaction conditions selected for removing the α amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis. The protecting group should not be split off under coupling conditions, and the protecting group should be removable upon completion of the synthesis of the desired amino acid sequence under reaction conditions that will not alter the peptide chain. When the X⁷ group is Gly O CH₂ resin support , D Ala O CH₂ resin support or O CH₂ resin support , the ester moiety of one of the many functional groups of the polystyrene resin support is being represented. When the X⁷ group is Gly NH resin support or D Ala NH resin support , an amide bond connects Gly or D Ala to BHA resin or to a MBHA resin. When X is acetyl, for example, in the final formula, it may be possible to employ it as the X¹ protecting group for the α amino group of D NAL or whatever amino acid is used in the 1 position by adding it before the coupling of this last amino acid to the peptide chain. However, a reaction is preferably carried out with the peptide on the resin after deblocking the α amino group while the side chain groups remain protected , e.g. by reacting with acetic acid in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCC or preferably with acetic anhydride or by another suitable reaction as known in the art. The fully protected peptide can be cleaved from a chloromethylated resin support by ammonolysis, as is well known in the art, to yield the fully protected amide intermediate. Deprotection of the peptide, as well as cleavage of the peptide from a benzhydrylamine resin, can take place at 0 C with hydrofluoric acid HF . Anisole is preferably added to the peptide prior to treatment with HF. After the removal of HF, under vacuum, the cleaved, deprotected peptide is conveniently treated with ether, decanted, taken up in dilute acetic acid and lyophilized. Thus the invention also provides a method for making a peptide or a nontoxic salt thereof, said peptide having the formula Purification of the peptide is effected by ion exchange chromotography on a CMC column, followed by partition chromotography using the elution system n butanol 0.1N acetic acid 1 1 volume ratio on a column packed with Sephadex G 25, or by using HPLC, as known in the art and specifically set forth in J. Rivier, et al. The peptides of the invention are effective at levels of less than 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, when administered at about noon on the day of proestrous, to prevent ovulation in female rats. For prolonged suppression of ovulation, it may be necessary to use dosage levels in the range of from about 0.1 to about 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. These antagonists are also effective to arrest spermatogenesis when administered to male mammals on a regular basis and can thus be used as contraceptives. Since these compounds will reduce testosterone levels an undesired consequence in the normal, sexually active male , it may be reasonable to administer replacement dosages of testosterone along with the GnRH antagonist. These antagonists can also be used to regulate the production of gonadotropins and sex steroids for other purposes as indicated hereinbefore. Peptides as indicated in TABLE I having the formula For purposes of an example, a representative solid phase synthesis of Peptide No. 1 above, which is referred to as Ac β D 2NAL¹, 4F D Phe², 6NO₂ D Trp³, D Arg⁶ GnRH is set forth hereinafter. This peptide has the following formula Ac β D 2NAL 4F D Phe 6NO₂ D Trp Ser Tyr D Arg Leu Arg Pro Gly NH₂. The other peptides are similarly synthesized and purified. A BHA resin is used, and Boc protected Gly is coupled to the resin over a 2 hour period in CH₂Cl₂ using a 3 fold excess of Boc derivative and DCC as an activating reagent. The glycine residue attaches to the BHA residue by an amide bond. Following the coupling of each amino acid residue, washing, deblocking and coupling of the next amino acid residue is carried out in accordance with the following schedule using an automated machine and beginning with about 5 grams of resin After step 13, an aliquot may be taken for a ninhydrin test if the test is negative, go back to step 1 for coupling of the next amino acid if the test is positive or slightly positive, go back and repeat steps 9 through 13. The above schedule is used for coupling of each of the amino acids of the peptide of the invention after the first amino acid has been attached. NαBoc protection is used for each of the remaining amino acids throughout the synthesis. NαBoc β D 2NAL is prepared by a method known in the art, e.g. as described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,234,571, issued November 18, 1980. The side chain of Arg is protected with Tos. OBzl is used as a side chain protecting group for the hydroxyl group of Ser. 6NO₂ D Trp is left unprotected. NαBoc β D 2NAL is introduced as the final amino acid. Boc Arg Tos and Boc 6NO₂ D Trp, which have low solubility in CH₂Cl₂, are coupled using DMF CH₂Cl₂ mixtures. After deblocking the α amino group at the N terminal, acetylation is achieved using a large excess of acetic anhydride in dichloromethane. The cleavage of the peptide from the resin and complete deprotection of the side chains takes place very readily at 0 C. with HF. Anisole is added as a scavenger prior to HF treatment. After the removal of HF under vacuum, the resin is extracted with 50 acetic acid, and the washings are lyophilized to provide a crude peptide powder. Purification of the peptide is then effected by ion exchange chromatography on CMC Whatman CM 32, using a gradient of 6.05 to 0.3M NH₄OAc in 50 50 methanol water followed by partition chromatography in a gel filtration column using the elution system n Butanol 0.1N Acetic acid 1 1 volume ratio . The peptide is judged to be homogeneous using thin layer chromatography and several different solvent systems, as well as by using reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography and an aqueous triethylammonium phosphate solution plus acetonitrile. Amino acid analysis of the resultant, purified peptide is consistent with the formula for the prepared structure, showing substantially integer values for each amino acid in the chain. The optical rotation is measured on a photoelectric polarimeter as α 22 D 31.8 1 c 1, 50 acetic acid . The peptides are assayed All peptides listed in Table I are considered effective to block GnRH induced LH secretion Peptides as indicated in TABLE II having the formula Peptides as indicated in TABLE III having the formula Ac R₁ R₂ D 3PAL Ser Arg R₆ R₇ Arg Pro R₁₀ are prepared by the solid phase procedure referred to above. The peptides described in TABLE III are tested The peptides of the invention are often administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts, or of metal complexes, e.g., with zinc, barium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum or the like which are considered as addition salts for purposes of this application , or of combinations of the two. Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate, oxalate, fumarate, gluconate, tannate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alginate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. For example, an aqueous solution of the peptide can be repeatedly treated with 1N acetic acid and then lyophilized to yield the acetic acid salt thereof. If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent which includes a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and or flavoring may be used as part of the pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, and intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Usually, the dosage will be from about 1 to about 100 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host when given intravenously oral dosages will be higher. Overall, treatment of subjects with these peptides is generally carried out in the same manner as the clinical treatment using other antagonists of GnRH. These peptides can be administered to mammals intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, orally, percutaneously, e.g. intranasally or intravaginally to achieve fertility inhibition and or control and also in applications calling for reversible suppression of gonadal activity, such as for the management of precocious puberty or during radiation or chemo therapy. Effective dosages will vary with the form of administration and the particular species of mammal being treated. An example of one typical dosage form is a bacteriostatic water solution containing the peptide which solution is administered to provide a dose in the range of about 0.1 to 2.5 mg kg of body weight. Oral administration of the peptide may be given in either solid form or liquid form. Although the invention has been described with regard to its preferred embodiments, it should be understood that changes and modifications as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in this art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is set forth in the claims which are appended hereto. For example, other substitutions known in the art which do not significantly detract from the effectiveness of the peptides may be employed in the peptides of the invention. The substitutions in the phenyl ring of the D Phe² residue may also be in the 3 position and in the 2,4 positions, which are considered equivalents similarly, D 2PAL and D 4PAL are considered to be equivalents of D 3PAL. At the C terminus, Pro⁹ can be linked to one of the following moieties which are considered to generally be equivalents thereof Gly OCH₃, Gly OCH₃CH₃, Sar NH₂, or NH Y , with Y being lower alkyl, particularly ethyl, cycloalkyl, fluoro lower alkyl or NHCONHQ, where Q is H or lower alkyl. Sar stands for sarcosine.
