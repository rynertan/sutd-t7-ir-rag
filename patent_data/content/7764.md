# Stabilized ferromagnetic chromium dioxide and a process for preparing it.

## Abstract
A stabilized ferromagnetic chromium dioxide, CrO₂, con sists of particles of ferromagnetic chromium dioxide coated with a coating comprises a mixture of Fe₂O₃ and MnO or of a mixture of a ferrite MeFe₂O₄ with the oxides Fe₂O₃ and MeO wherein Me is Cu, Co, Zn or Mg in which mixtures the molar ratio of Fe₂O₃ MnO or MeO is unity. The product is obtained by dispersing ferromagnetic chromium dioxide in water, co precipitating Fe OH ₃ and Mn OH ₂ or Me OH ₂ onto it, drying the resultant mixture at a temperature not exceeding 100 C and finally calcining the dried product at a temperature of from 250 to 350 C.
