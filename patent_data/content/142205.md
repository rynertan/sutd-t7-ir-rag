# A cover construction for a steam peeling apparatus.

## Abstract
A steam peeling or boiling apparatus for crops, such as potatoes, carrots, celery, apples and the like, or for meat, comprising a substantially cylindrical peeling vessel arranged for rotation around horizontal stub shafts, having a supply and discharge opening disposed eccentrically or non eccentrically in one of the end faces. The opening is closable by an inwardly movable cover operated by a lever rotatably connected thereto, the other end of which is rotatably con nected to the exterior of the vessel. The cover is provided with a second operating lever by means of which the cover can be displaced along the inner wall of the vessel in entirely con trolled fashion. The second operating lever is rotatably con nected to the exterior of the vessel at a location situated in the perpendicular median plane between the initial and final posi tions of the cover pivot of the second operating lever.
