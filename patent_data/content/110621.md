# Image signal processing system based on synthetic aperture technique.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reconstructing an image signal of a foreground subject wherein a probe 10 having a plurality of transducers 12 for scanning a foreground subject 14 by radiation, such as an ultrasonic beam, is connected to a phase detector through a receiver 22 . An electrical signal S₃ corres ponding to a wave reflected from the foreground subject 14 is phasedetected by a phase detector 24 . At least one resultant hologram signal S₅, S₆ is subjected to the A D conversion to be stored in a buffer memory 30, 32 . A processing unit 34 causes the hologram signal S₅, S₆ to be read out of the buffer memory 30, 32 carries out the convolution integration of the hologram signal, S₅, S₆ and the corresponding kernel function data by the synthetic aperature technique, thereby producing a recon structed image signal. The processing unit 34 further carries out the nonlinear compression of the amplitude of the hologram signal before the convolution integration and performs the non linear expansion of the amplitude of an image signal after the convolution integration.
