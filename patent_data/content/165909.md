## Description
Composition and process for coating a metal article with a protective pigmented polymeric layer by in situ redox polymerization.The present invention relates to a composition and a method for coating a metal article with a protective pigmented polymeric layer by redox polymerisation in situ.More particularly, the invention relates to a composition of the type comprising, in aqueous solution, an acrylic monomer, a peroxide type initiator and an acid or a salt for liberating metal ions from the surface of the article, the composition having a pH of from 6 to 0.5 and having a quantity of molecular oxygen dissolved therein as a polymerisation inhibitor.Compositions of the type mentioned above are known fromU.K. Patent No. 1,155,497, U.S. Patent No. 3,865,617 and from Italian Patent Applications Nos. 67119 A 78 and 67359 A 82.Protective coatings polymerised by the in situ redz rmethod,by immersion of a metal article in compositions of the type mentioned above, are generally very satisfactory in terms of adhesion to the metal substrate, hardness, strength in bending tests and resistance to saline fog.However even if a pigment is included in the compositions mentioned above, it is not possible to form a pigmented polymerised polymeric coating on the metal article in situ. Consequently such coatings are suitable solely as undercoat in painting processes whereby it is generally necessary1 in industry, to apply a second layer by conventional painting techniques to obtain a finished, painted article. Compositions are also known from the Patent literature, for example from European Patent No. 26,664 and European Patent No. 32,297, which autodeposit on the surface of a metal object immersed therein without an electrical potential, and which are constituted by0an emulsion or a dispersion of saturated polymers, preferably for example styrene butadiene latex, polyvinyl chloride acrylic polymers and polyethylene, including an acid, fluoride ions and an oxidising agent such as H2O2, R2Cr207, and or persulphate ions.The mechanism for the deposition of the coating layer which is common to these compositions, which may include a pigment so as to allow a pigmented coating to be obtained, is simply that of coagulation of the polymer. In fact the metal ions generated by corrosion of the substrate due to the high H concentration and the presence of oxidants, increase the ionic potential at the metal solution interface considerably and cause the polymer to coagulate and form the film. Coatings obtained with the use of these compositions however do not adhere well to the metal substrate, have weak cohesion and poor resistance to rinsing with waterCataphoretic processes are also known for coating metal articles by immersion and these use baths including polymers which are dispersible or soluble at acid pHs and which may have acrylic functional groups.These processes however are clearly expensive from an energy point of view since they require an electrical potential to be applied to achieve the electrophoretic migration and precipitation of the polymer on the metal substrate. Furthermore, the possible presence of acrylic functional groups in the polymer means that the cross linking of the film can only be achieved in a subsequent process, under the effect of heat or ultra violet radiation, so much so that, if a test piece coated with a cataphoretically deposited film which has not been cross linked in an oven is washed with a solvent for the polymer, the polymer is easily dissolved leaving the sheet metal bare.In view of the deficiencies and disadvantages of the prior art, the object of the present invention is to provide a composition and a method which allow the deposition and simultaneous cross linking of a protective pigmented polymeric coating on metal articles, by simple immersion of the article in the composition, without an electrical potential.One subject of the present invention is thus a composition comprising, in aqueous solution, at least one monofunctional acrylic monomer, a peroxide type initiator, and an acid or a salt for liberating metal ions from the surface of the article, the composition having a pH of from 6 to 0.5 and having a quantity of molecular oxygen dissolved therein to act as a polymerisation inhibitor, characterised in that it also includes at least one pigment and at least one unsaturated prepolymer which is soluble or dispersible in the aqueous solution.The prepolymer preferably has acrylic or methacrylic type unsaturation of the order of 0.05 to 15 equivalents per kg of prepolymer and is present in quantities of the order of 0.5 to 25 by weight, more preferably from 5 to 15 by weight, with reference to the weight of the composition. In order to allow its dissolution or dispersion in water at a pH of between 0.5 and 6, the prepolymer must have cationic functional groups such as primary, secondary or tertiary amine groups, ammonium sulphonium, phosphonium, oxazolidine ions or Mannich bases the functional groups being present in quantities of the order of 0.05 to 10 equivalents per kg of prepolymer.The prepolymer may also, optionally, have other functional groups which can cause an increase in the degree of cross linking during subsequent drying or interaction with any subsequent paint layer, whenever its application is desirable. Functional groups suitable for this purpose are,for example, blocked isocyanate groups, epoxy groups, series of siccative fatty acids and allyl derivatives.Prepolymers which are dispersible and or soluble at acid pH and which are suitable for use in the composition according to the invention are known and available commercially. For example, prepolymers for use in cathode electrophoresis may be employed, such as those described in the review The Chemistry ofBinders for Electrodeposition by H.U. Shenck et al., inProgress inorganic coating, 7 1979 pages 57 to 77.The synthesis of prepolymers which are dispersible in water and have acrylic functional groups suitable for use in the composition is also described, for example, in U.S.Patents Nos. 4,252,734, 4,166,017 and 4,130,522, with reference to coatings which can be deposited by electrophoresis and cross linked by radiation.In the experimental tests which will be described below, there were used for the compositions according to the invention, with suitable results, prepolymers derived from epoxy resins, acrylic resins, butadiene resins and polyester resins, modified by the introduction of acrylic or methacrylic unsaturation and functional groups adapted to make them dispersible or soluble in water.The pigments and or fillers usable are acidic and chosen from the group aluminium silicate, kaolin, silica, mica, titanium dioxide, carbon black, iron oxides and anti corrosive pigments such as lead silicate, lead silico chromate and mixtures thereof.Moreover basic fillers and pigments such as calcium carbonate, alumina, zinc oxide, zinc sulphide, basic lead carbonate and sulphate and metal powders, cannot be used in the composition according to the invention since they are subject to flocculation or decomposition in the acid environment. The concentration of the pigments is typically from 0.1 to 20 by weight, preferably from 1 to 10 by weight, with reference to the weight of the composition. The water soluble acrylic monomer is preferably an acrylic ester of a polyvalent alcohol such as glycerine, ethylene glycol or butane diol, with a low volatility. It is preferably chosen from the group constituted by 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 3 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate, 5 hydroxypentyl acrylate, 6 hydroxyhexyl acrylate, 3 propoxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate and 3 propionyloxy 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate and mixtures thereof. The concentration of the monomer or of several such monomers if used simultaneously may be chosen within ede limits, generally from 0.5 to 25 by weight, preferably from 2 to 10 percent by weight.In addition to the hydroxyalkyl esters mentioned above other acrylic monomers may be used, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, n 2 oxobutyl acrylamide. It is however preferable that these monomers should not be used alone, or as a principal monomer, but rather used in combination with a hydroxyalkyl ester of the type mentioned above. For example the acrylic acid may be used conveniently in combination with 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate since the copolymers thus obtained are less hydrophilic compared with the homopolymer and thus yield protective films which are more resistant to washing with water.In the case in which the acrylic unsaturation content of the prepolymer should be low, with a view to impro ving the anti corrosive characteristics of the coating, by increasing the degree of cross linking, it may be appropriate to add to the composition bifunctional monomer cross linking agents in concentrations of 0.1 to 5 by weight. suitable cross link ing comonomers are for example butanediol diacrylate, hexamethylene diacrylate, tetramethylene diacrylate and diacrylates of polyethylene glycols. The crosslinking comonomers may however already be present in the mono functional monomer as an inherent impurity, since the mono functional monomers used are generally of industrial grade. The acids which serve to neutralise the prepolymer and to keep the pH of the composition within the range 0.5 to 6, preferably 2 to 4, and which also serve to liberate metal ions from the surface of the article, may be strong inorganic acids such as sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid or inorganic acids such as formic, acetic, propionic, acrylic and methacrylic acids and hemiesters of maleic,fumaric, succinic, oxalic and malonic acids. The concentration of the acid in the composition must, however, be greater than the concentration needed to neutralise the amine groups in the prepolymer.It is particularly advantageous to add p toluenesulphonic acid to the composition in concentrations of 0.01 to 0.5 by weight since this results in an increase in the yield from the deposition process, probably because of its catalytic activity towards peroxides.As salts there may be used, for example, CuC12,FeC13 orAgNO3, generally in concentrations of no more than 1 by weight.Since the ionic force plays an important role in the dispersion of the prepolymers, it is not always possible to use alkaline peroxydisulphates, suggested by the prior art, as the peroxy initiators since they may cause the resin to coagulate. Hence water soluble organic peroxides, such as tert butyl hydroperoxide, 2 butanone peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide, in concentrations of from 0.05 to 2 by weight, are preferably used In order to improve the dispersion of the prepolymer and the subsequent ESaetkn of the polymeric coating film, it is advantageous to use co solvents in concentrations of up to 20 by weight and preferably from 2 to 8 . Such co solvents, which must, in any case, be stable to oxidation, may be used alone or in mixtures and are preferably chosen from the group comprising isopropanol, butanol, 2 ethylhexanol, 2 ethoxyethanol cellosolve R.T .M. 2 butoxyethanol butylcellosolve R.T.M. , and 2 ethoxyethyl acetate cellosolve acetate R.T.M. . In order to prepare the composition, the prepolymer and theigments are preferably first made into a paste. For this purpose the prepolymer is neutralised with acid and then diluted with water and possibly with a mixture of co solvents.The paste obtained is then mixed with the pigments, with the use of a Sussmeyer mill. The dispersion thus obtained is then introduced into the vessel in which it is diluted with water and the monomer and the initiator are added. The pH of the composition is then adjusted until the desired value is achieved.A further subject of the present invention is a method for coating a metal article with a pigmented polymeric layer by means of redox polymerisation in situ, the method comprising the operation of immersing the article to be coated in the composition described above. Preferably,as already described in Italian patent application no. 67359 A 82, the composition constituting the bath is circulated through a separate oxygenation zone into which molecular oxygen or air is blown or bubbled, the rate of circulation and the supply of oxygen or air being regulated so that the composition has a constant dissolved oxygen content of at least 4 ppm.The circulation of the composition together with the presence of the prepolymer maintains the pigment in dispersion, preventing its sedimentation. Furthermore the oxygenation of the composition under recycle conditions ensures the stability of the composition, preventing bulk polymerisation.The method is preferably carried out with the temperature of the composition kept between about 10and about 30 C, more preferably at 2O 250C. The metal articles to be coated are typically of ferrous material, particularly steel, but may also be of another metal for example copper or an alloy, as taught by the prior art. The term ferrous material also includes surfaces modified chemically for anti corrosive purposes, particularly phosphated surfaces. In this case the pH of the solution should be less than 3, phosphoric acid preferably being used.The method is carried out by immersing the article to be coated for a period typically of 2 to 3 minutes. It has been found that, with the use of the composition according to the invention, the thickness of the pigmented coating films obtained is greater than the thickness of coatings obtainable by the prior art for the same immersion time. The pigmented coating obtainable by the present method is already cross linked and has good mechanical characteristics whereby it is notnecessary to apply a further layer of paint in accordance with conventional methods in order to obtain a finished painted product.For a fuller description of the method carried out under refill conditions and of the plant for carrying out the method the reader is referred to the text of Italian patent no. 67359 A 82.Example t The experimental tests were carried out with the use of laboratory apparatus having a solution capacity of two litres and a separate small oxygenation cell with a circulation pump and ejector. The test pieces to be coated were mild steel sheets having a size of 150 x 70 x 0.8 mm.An unsaturated epoxy resin with an amine content of 1.42 equivalents kg dry weight, obtained by the process given below, was used as the prepolymer.380 g of the polyglycidyl ether of bisphenol A Epikote 828, equivalent epoxy weight 790 were placed in a 2 litre reactor and diluted with 300 g of cellosolve acetate to which 10 g of hydroquinone monomethyl ether, 2 g of tetraethylammonium iodide and 428 g of 2 acryloxyethyl H maleate obtained by the reaction of equimolecular quantities of maleic anhydride and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate had been added. After 4 hours at a temperature of from 130 to 1400C, the acid value had fallen to 3 mg KOH g, 348 g of toluylene di isocyanate 80 20 mixture of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers diluted with 200 g of cellosolve acetate were introduced into a second reactor and 238 g of N ,N diethylethanolamine were added under anhydrous nitrogen, with agitation and cooling, the temperature being kept below 3OOC. The isocyanate group content of this product was about 10.5 . The epoxy ester obtained in the first reactor was then cooled to about 75 0C and then 2 ml of dibutyl tin dilaurate and the reaction product obtained in the second reactor were added.The final product, 73 by weight in cellosolve acetate, had an amine content of 1.42 equivalents kg dry weight prepolymer A .350 g of prepolymer A were neutralised with 24 ml of 85 by weight, H3Oar diluted with 50 ml of 2butoxyethanol and 200 ml of water. 50 g of ASP 100 kaolin and 4 g of LT carbon black were then added, the mixture being homogenised in a Sussmayer mill for 1 hour.The dispersion obtained was transferred into a test tank with an added 60g of 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate, diluted to 2 litres and 2.2 ml of t butyl hydroperoxide..were added.The percentage by weight concentrations of the individual components of the composition according to the invention were as follows Composition 1 Resin A 12.7 Pigment kaolin carbon black in 12.5 1 ratio 2.7 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate 3.0 t butyl hydroperoxide 0.11 phosphoric acid 1.0 2 butoxyethanol 2.78 Cellosolve acetate 4.8 pH 2.9 Bath temperature 18 0C In all the tests carried out in the present example and in the following examples, the oxygenation cell gave a dissolved oxygen content equal to the saturation value at the test temperature. The test pieces were immersed in the composition then washed with water and dried in an oven at 1800C for 30 minutes.The coating yield was tabulated as a function of time and is given in Table I. After each test, at least one test piece was washed with water then immersed in a solvent for the prepolymer tetrahydrofuran to check for in situ polymerisation and cross linking. In all the tests given in the examples, the treatment with solvent did not result in the film being dissolved.After drying in an oven for 30 minutes at 1800C, each test piece was then subjected to an adhesion and bending test, an impact test and a test for resistance to corrosion by exposure to saline fog. The results of these tests are given for all the examples in Table II, together with values for the coating yield after 2 minutes of immersion.Example IBExample 1 was repeated with the introduction of lg of p toluenesulphonic acid into the composition, this not giving any substantial variation in the pH, but increasing the yield of the process. The coating yield is given in Table I.Comparative ExampleThe prepolymers used in the composition according to the present invention do not result in the formation of polymeric films in the presence solely of the peroxy initiator. However the presence of the monomer in the composition may make one suspect that the prepolymer remains trapped in the film being formed.In order to evaluate the effective interaction between the prepolymer and the polymeric film made in situ, a composition was prepared in which the monomer was constituted by acrylic acid. If the resin were not involved in the polymerisation process, a film would not be formed since the homopolymer of acrylic acid is soluble in the composition and cannot be cross linked.The percentage concentration by weight of the components of the reference composition was as follows Prepolymer A Example 1 6.0 Cellosolve acetate 4.0 Acrylic acid 3.0 t butyl hydroperoxide 0.17 pH 3.5 Bath temperature 180C Although the speed of formation of the film was very slow, an extremely cross linked, thin film was obtained.To confirm the occurrence of cross linking, the coated test piece was immersed in tetrahydrofuran without the film dissolving. The coating yield is given inTable I as a function of the immersion time.The test was repeated with the use of the reference composition given above but without the use of the acrylic monomer in this case no film formed on the test piece immersed on the composition.

An unsaturated prepolymer having an amine content of 0.91 equivalents kg dry weight was used.For the preparation of the prepolymer, 500 g of the polyglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DER 671, equivalent epoxy weight 499 were introduced into a two litre reactor and were dissolved in 350 ml of cellosolve acetate to which 73 g of diethylamine were added, the temperature being kept at 60 70 C until the IR peak at about 920 cm 1 attributed to the oxiran ring had disappeared. 2 ml of dibutyl tin dilaurate and two isocyanate derivates were then added, the first being obtained by the addition of 166 g of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate to 174g of toluylene di isocyanate and 100 ml of cellosolve acetate at a temperature below 50 C. The second isocyanate was obtained by the addition of 45g of cellosolve to 87g of toluylene di isocyanate and 50 ml of cellosolve acetate The final product prepolymer B had a dry residue of 678. 300 g of the prepolymer B were neutralised with 15 ml of H3PO4 858 by weight and 1 g of p toluenesulphonic acid, diluted with 100 ml of water and mixed with 86 g of TiO2, 13 g of kaolin and 1g of carbon black. After grinding in a sand mill, the dispersion was transferred to the test apparatus and 100 g of 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate were added with 10 g of tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, and 5 ml of t butyl hydroperoxide, and the contents were then diluted to 2 litres.

Over a period of 1.5 hours a mixture was added which consisted of 166 g of ethyl acrylate, 75 g of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 166 g of N,N diethylaminoethyl acrylate and 2 g of azo bis isobutyronitrile. Over the subsequent 2 hours, a further 2 aliquots each comprising 2 g of initiator were added, the system being kept at about 80 C. There were then introduced at 700C, one ml of dlbutyl tin dilaurate and the solution of a suitable isocyanate obtained by the addition of 37.4 g of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate and 28.8 g of 2 ethoxyethanol to 112.2 g of toluylene di isocyanate and 100 g of cellosolve acetate. A final product was obtained comprising 66 dry weight in cellosolve acetate prepolymer C .300 g of the prepolymer C were neutralised with 22 ml ofH3PO4 85 by weight in 100 ml of water to which 100 ml of butyl cellosolve and 30 g of red oxide were added.After grinding in a mill, the dispersion obtained was introduced into the test apparatus with the addition ofIg of p toluenesulphonic acid, 60g of 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate and 4.4 ml of t butyl hydroperoxide, the volume then being brought to 2 litres.
