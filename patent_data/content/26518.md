# Magnetic bubble domain structure.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble domain structure comprising a bubble domain layer 5 supported by a non magnetic substrate 4 and having a control layer 7 superimposed on its major surface remote from the substrate, said control layer 7 having an easy axis of magnetization in the plane of the layer which defines at least one bubble domain propagation path. Since the unique control layer according to the invention is a garnet layer which comprises two sub layers, a first, continuous, sub layer 8 and a second, discontinuous, sub layer 9 , the latter defining the required propagation patterns, the advantage is obtained that the in plane rotary field to be applied for propagating the bubble domains can be considerably weaker than in bubble domain structures which are equipped with nickel iron propagation patterns.
