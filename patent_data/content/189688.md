# Monoclonal antibody capable of recognizing arteriosclerotic lesions and agents for detecting and treating arteriosclerosis.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed are a monoclonal antibody capable of preferentially recognizing arteriosclerotic lesions and prepared from a hybridoma obtained by fusing myeloma cells and cells capable of producing antibodies against arteriosclerotic lesions, such as spleen cells, peripheral lymphocyte of thymus and peripheral vascular cells, the antibody being able to use as an agent for detecting the presence of arteriosclerotic lesions in a body examined and for treating arteriosclerosis.
