# Method and device for raising worms, method of raising worms in nutrition limited by inhibiting means, method of producing worm castings, and holder for raising worms.

## Abstract
The worms are fed in accordance with a continuously growing nutritional chain 28, 29 in a manner such that a migration of a work population following said chain is produced. At least once an accretion 5 of the worm population is separated therefrom, leaving a migrating stock population 6 in the nutritional chain 28, 29 , whereas the accretion 5 migrates in the direction of an accretion nutritional chain which starts from the stock nutritional chain, and can be harvested therefrom. Means, e.g., inhibit ing means 20 , anti creep means, supplying means, and heat exchanging means, are described for raising the worm under conditions which are optimal for the farmer and depend, for instance, on economical and on season condi tions. The method and or device can be advantageously used for producing work casting, since the worms can be main tained under conditions, whereby the nutrition conversion velocity of the nutrition offered to the worms is maximal over a long period of time.
