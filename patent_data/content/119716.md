## Abstract
A unique CVSD CODEC is provided utilizing switched capacitor technology. This CVSD CODEC includes a syllabic filter which provides one of a large number of possible step sizes, thereby allowing the CVSD CODEC to accurately track and convert a wide range of input voltages. The CVSD CODEC includes coincidence logic, which determines how accurately the input voltage is being tracked, and a syllabic filter which provides an appropriate step size based upon the output signals of the coincidence logic. Large step sizes are provided for converting input voltages having large magnitudes, and small step sizes are used to convert input voltages having small magnitudes, thereby providing the very accurate resolution of input voltages over the wide range of magnitudes, while minimizing the bit rate required.
