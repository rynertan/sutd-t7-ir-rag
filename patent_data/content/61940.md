# Differential pressure measuring system.

## Abstract
A differential pressure measuring system is disclosed. The system includes two quartz capacitive pressure trans ducers 14, 16 . Each capsule contains a pressure sensitive capacitor Csa Csb and a pressure insensitive reference capacitor Cra Crb . The pressure sensitive capacitors Csa, Csb are excited by out of phase signals Vr, Vr which further excite the reference capacitors Crb, Cra out of phase, respectively. The outputs of all capacitors Csa, Csb, Cra, Crb are combined in a summing junction 22 whose output controls the count of a digital integrator 34 . A closed loop is formed by converting the output of the integrator 34 to a negative feedback signal Vrf N which is applied to the summing junction 22 through a feedback capacitor Cf . The integrator 34 incrementally changes the feedback signal Vrf N in a direction to balance the loop. At this point the output of the integrator 34 is representative of the mea sured differential pressure.
