## Abstract
Anti skid device for vehicles including a chain provided pulley 1 arranged rotable on an arm 4 journalled on a shaft 5 . The shaft is connected with an eccentric pulley. Round the pulley 6 cables 7, 7 are arranged also fastened to the pulley. The two cables are in flexible pipes led to an air cyl inder 8 and an air spring 9 respectively and movement of arm and chain provided pulley 1 from parking position to working position is achieved by the air cylinder pulling in the cable that in turn turns the pulley and the connected arm 4 . Below the parking location of the chain provided pulley 1 a shelf 15 is arranged. When the chain provided pulleys are parked the chins are drawn over the edge of the shelf 15 and they are thus pulled up from possible contact with the ground. In this way it is possible to use necessary chain length together with a very low mounting of the device.
