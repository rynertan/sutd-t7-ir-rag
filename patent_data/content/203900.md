# CHLORINATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for chlorinating swimming bath water, in cludes an electrochemical cell 2 with an anolyte chamber 25 and a catholyte chamber 22 , which are separated by an ion selective diaphragm 290 , a metering device 7 for sup plying consumption hydrochloric acid to the cell 2 , a chlorine gas outlet from the upper space 26 of the anolyte chamber 25 , a chlorine gas pipe 29 for transferring chlorine gas from the cell 2 , to a circulation pipe 15 for the bath water, an ejector 10 connecting the chlorine gas pipe 29 to the bath water pipe 15 . The ejector 10 is adapted to generate a pressure in the chlorine gas pipe 29 which is lower than atmospheric pressure, and a gas flow in the gas pipe 29 which is greater than the greatest chlorine gas production flow of the cell 2 . An atmospheric air pipe 35, 45 communicates with the chlorine gas pipe 29 . A liquid trap device 3 is arranged in the air pipe. There is a liquid overflow outlet 40 on the low pressure side of the liquid trap device. There are means for feeding a liquid such as cooling liquid for the cell 2 through the liquid chamber 31 of the liquid trap device to, and through its overflow outlet 40 . Sensing means 43, 44 sense the liquid level in the liquid trap device on its high and or low pressure side, said means 43, 44 being adapted to inhibit the chlorine production of the cell 2 if the sensed liquid level deviates from a previously determined level N1 N2 .
