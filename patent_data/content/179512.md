# Microwave arrangement for heating material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a microwave arrangement for heating material in a continuous process 14 . The microwave arrangement 1 comprises a circular cylindrical resonator 2 in which a field configuration is generated, areas having a maximum field energy being created in the resonator 2 . By passing more specifically low dielectric loss materials 14 a plurality of times along a helical path through these areas, the efficiency is significantly improved. An embodiment which is particularly suitable for drying wire or tape form materials 14 comprises a rotatable circular cylindrical reel 8 via which the materials 14 are conveyed to the areas.
