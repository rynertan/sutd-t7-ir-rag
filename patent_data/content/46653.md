## Description
METEIOD FOR CONVERTING CARBOXYLIC ACID GROUPS TO TRICLOROMETEYL GROUPS It is known to convert a ring attached carboxylic acid group to a trichloromethyl group when the acid group is on the ring of a nitrogen heteroaromatic compound and in a position adjacent to a ring nitrogen atom. One reason for making such conversions is to allow for the preparation of compounds which cannot be prepared by the conventional practice of direct chlorination of methyl groups. For example, compounds containing alkoxy, alkyl or alkoxy or alkyl substituted aryl groups, in addition to the methyl group to be converted, cannot normally be prepared by direct chlorination without chlorination of the above groups. Most known processes for the conversion of carboxylic acid groups to trichloromethyl groups involve treatment of the carboxylic acid compound with phosphorus pentachloride usually in the presence of excess thionyl chloride. Such processes are taught by Takahashi et al. Kinetic study on the conversion of pyridine and Quinolinecarboxylic acids to the corresponding Trichloromethyl Compound , J. Rest. Chem.15 893 1978 Chemical Abstracts 74, 125566y ChemicalAbstracts 79 31986m and Chemical Abstracts 81 105395h.Related processes for other types of chlorinations are taught in Chemical Abstracts 63 9901d and U.S. Patent 2,907,798. Since the known procedures are only useful in the conversion of carboxylic acid groups to tri chloromethyl groups when the acid group is adjacent to the nitrogen atom in a nitrogen heteroaromatic cyclic, it would be desirable to find less selective procedures and procedures which can be employed with other than nitrogen heteroaromatics. This invention is directed to a method for the conversion of carboxylic acid groups to trichloromethyl groups which comprises contacting an aryl or heteroaryl compound containing a carboxylic acid group with a phenylphosphonic dichloride and phosphorus pentachloride. More specifically, this invention provides a method for the conversion of any carboxylic acid groups on an aryl or heteroaryl ring to trichloromethyl groups by reaction thereof with a phenyl phosphonic dichloride and phosphorus pentachloride. This reaction can be characterized as follows EMI2.1 wherein R represents aryl or N heteroaryl and n is 1or 2. No attempt has been made to present a balanced equation. The aryl or N heteroaryl carboxylic acid compounds useful in the present process can be any aryl or N heteroaryl compound containing one or two carboxylic acid groups in non sterically bindered ring pn.91.ti on. And which compound is substantially chemically and physically stable under the acidic conditions of the reaction with the exception of the conversion of The carboxylic acid groups to the corresponding trichloromethyl groups. When there are two acid groups present they should be in nonadjacent ring positions to avoid steric hindrance problems. The compounds can in addition be ring substituted with additional sterically compatible groups which are non reactive under the conditions of the reaction such as chloro, fluoro, nitro, cyano, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, aryl, alkyl substituted aryl, alkoxy substituted aryl, aryloxy, trichloromethyl or trifluoromethyl. To further insure that problems of steric hindrance be avoided, it is important that no groups having an atom radius larger than the atom radius of a chlorine atom be adjacent to a carboxylic acid group.Further, if an alkyl, alkylthio or alkoxy group is substituted on an aryl ring, it is necessary that a strong electron withdrawing group such as nitro or cyano be also on the ring. This latter requirement is not necessary for N heteroaromatic compounds. In the present specification and claims, the term sterically compatible is employed to designate substituent groups which are not affected by steric hindrance as defined in The Condensed ChemicalDictionary , 7th edition, Reinhold Publishing Co.,New York, page 893 1966 which definition is as follows steric hindrance. A characteristic of molecular structure in which the molecules have a spatial arrangement of their atoms such that a given reaction with another molecule is prevented or retarded in rate. Steric hindrance may be further defined as compounds having substituents whose physical bulk does not require confinement within volumes insufficient for the exercise of their normal behavior as discussed in Organic Chemistry D. J. Cram and G. Hammond, 2nd edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, N.Y., page 215 1964 . In carrying out the present process, the order of the addition of the reactants is not critical although in some situations, one mixing procedure may be more desirable than another. For example, if the reaction is to be run on a large scale, it is helpful to allow the carboxylic acid compound and the phenyl phosphonic dichloride compound to react for a period of time until Eci evolution ceases before adding the phosphorus pentachloride. This allows for more control of any initial foaming which might occur and more control of the exothermic nature of the reaction. In other situations, all the reactants can be mixed together. After the reactants are mixed, the mixture is heated at reflux, 1000 2500C. The process is usually carried out at atmospheric pressure however, the reaction goes well at pressures of from 0.1 to 10 atmospheres The reaction is usually completed in from 4 hours to 7 days, dependent upon the temperature, reactants and amounts of reactant. Upon the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is cooled and the phosphorus oxychloride byproduct is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The desired product can be separated and recovered by conventional techniques such as by fractional distillatio under reduced pt eS sure or by solvent extraction after the reaction mixture was made basic with dilute base. The product can be purified, if desired, by conventional techniques such as by water washing, drying and recrystallization from a solvent such as benzene, hexane, methanol, chloroform, ether, cyclohexane or acetonitrile. The phenylphosphonic dichlorides are usually present in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 molar equivalents of the phenylphosphonic dichloride per carboxylic acid group on the carboxylic acid compound. Preferably, from 1 to 10 molar equivalents of the phenylphosphonic dichloride per carboxylic acid group is employed. Representative of those phenylphosphonic dichlorides which can be employed in the practice of the present invention include those corresponding to the formulaEMI5.1 wherein X, Y and Z independently represents hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, nitro and alkyl sulfonyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The phosphorus pentachloride is usually present in an amount of from 2 to 10 molar equivalents of the phosphorus pentachloride per carboxylic acid group on the carboxylic acid compound. Preferably, from 2 to 5 molar equivalents of the phosphorus pentachloride per carboxylic acid group are employed. If the carboxylic acid compound is ring substituted with a reactive group such as bromo, iodo or hydroxy group, an additional molar equivalent of the phosphorus pentachloride is necessary for each such group. These reactive groups are normally replaced with chlorine. The following examples further illustrate the present invention.Example 1 Preparation of 4 chloro 2,6 bis trichloro methylpyridine .EMI6.1 To a 5 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and condenser was added 1950 g 10 moles of phenylphosphonic dichloride. Thereafter 302 g 1.5 moles of 2,6 dicarboxy 4 hydroxypyridine monohydrate chelidamic acid monohydrate was rapidly added. The mixture was slowly and carefully heated to 1500C over a two hour period. Thereafter, the mixture was cooled to 500 600C and 1029 g 5.25 moles of phosphorus pentachloride was rapidly added. The mixture was heated until the internal temperature was 750 800C and the heat source removed. The temperature exothermically rose to 1250C and after a short period, the temperature started to cool.When the reaction mixture reached a temperature of 900C, a second portion of phosphorus pentachloride 1029 g 5.25 moles was added and the mixture heated at reflux 1400 1450C for 12 hours. The condenser was replaced with a distilling head and the reaction mixture was distilled and the by product phosphorus oxychloride was distilled off until a pot temperature of 2150C was reached. At this point, the distilling head was replaced with a short fractionating column and phenyl phosphonic dichloride was rapidly distilled off at 75 85 C and 0.05 millimiters of mercury mm Hg . The crude 4 chloro 2,6 bis trichloromethyl pyridine which remained solidified upon standing, and recrystallization of this material from methanol gave 314 g. 60 percent of theoretical . The product melted at 101 102 C and its structure was confirmed by itsNuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra NMR . In other runs, this compound was prepared in yields as high as 85 percent of theoretical. Example 2 Preparation of l nitro 4 trichloromethyl benzeneEMI8.1 A mixture was prepared by adding with stirring and in the following order, 16.7 g 0.1 mole of 4 nitrobenzoic acid, 15.7 g 0.11 mole of phenylphosphonic dichloride and 52 g 0.25 mole of phosphorus pentachloride. The mixture was heated and stirred and within 1 to 2 minutes, vigorous EC1 evolution began and the mixture became a clear yellow liquid. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 1L15 hours, cooled to 250C and the phosphorus oxychloride byproduct was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure.The oil which remained as a residue was cautiously poured into a 10 percent solution of sodium carbonate in cold water and stirred vigorously until foaming ceased while maintaining the temperature below 300C. The resultant solid crude l nitro 4 trichloromethyl benzene was recovered by filtration, washed with water, air dried and recrystallized from hexane to give 19.6 g 81 percent of theoretical of product. The product melted at 440 470C and its structure was confirmed by NMR. In other runs, this compound was prepared in yields as high as 94 percent of theoretical. Example 3 Preparation of 2,3 dichloro 5 trichloro methyl pyridineEMI9.1 To a 5 liter flask equipped with an air stirrer, thermometer, and condenser was added 1000 g 5.13 moles of phenylphosphonic dichloride. There after, 383 g 2.707 moles of 5 chloro 6 hydroxynicotinic acid prepared by bubbling chlorine into a stirred aqueous suspension of 6 hydroxynicotinic acid was added. The mixture was slowly heated and stirred over a 20 minute period, with the temperature rising to 730C. The mixture was in the form of a thick paste. To this mixture was slowly added 1755 g 8.4 moles of phosphorus pentachloride over a 45 minute period. The hydrogen chloride by product which formed was continuously removed and the heat was adjusted to maintain the temperature in the range of 830 1080C.After the phosphorus pentachloride addition was complete, the mixture was heated to reflux and some of the phosphorus oxychloride by product which formed was allowed to distill off. After a period of about 70 minutes, the temperature had exothermically risen to 1690C and the temperature was held in the range of 1620 1800C for 5 3 4 hours. During the above time additional phosphorus oxychloride was intermittently removed. The mixture was allowed to stand overnight and then poured over cracked ice, neutralized with 50 percent sodium hydroxide solution and the product extracted with hexane. The solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure leaving 567 g of crude 2,3 dichloro 5 trichloromethyl pyridine. The crude product was placed on a 15 tray vacuum jacketed Oldershaw distillation column and the light ends removed. The pot material was transferred to a tvigraux Claisen still and flash distilled to yield of 518 g 88.5 percent of theoretical of a colorless oil which analyzed as 99 percent pure 2,3 dichloro 5 trichloromethyl pyridine. Upon analysis, the product was found to have carbon, hydrogen, chlorine and nitrogen contents of 26.99 0.76 66.49 and 5.23 percent, respectively, as compared with the theoretical contents of 27.15 0.76 66.81 and 5.28 percent, respectively, as calculated for the above named compound.
