# Apparatus for decoding diphase input signals.

## Abstract
Incoming diphase signals E which have base bit inter vals delineated by spaced clocking signals with data in formation occurring between the clocking signals are fed to a four bit shift register 10 which in cooperation with an exclusive OR gate 14 generates a pulse D for each diphase signal E transition. Upon receipt of a preamble comprising four diphase signal transitions, a shift register 16 provides a signal MSR which initiates the decoding of the following data information. A counter 24 stores counts related to the time intervals between each two successive clocking signals and counters 26 and 28 store a count related to an immediately subsequent time period which is three fourths of the time interval. The occurrence of data information is sensed by a logic array 20 during successive time periods and a nonreturn to zero mark space output signal K is stored in a flip flop 22 . The logic array 20 continually updates the counts stored by the counters 24, 26 28 .
