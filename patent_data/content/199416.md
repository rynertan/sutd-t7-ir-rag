## Description
The invention relates to a process of increasing the pozzolanic properties of a pozzolanic material, particularly fly ash from coal fired units such as combusters of coal fired power stations and fluidized bed combusters and similar types of fly ash in order to increase the reactivity in relation to binding agents. By way of distinction binding agents can be divided into those reacting directly with fly ash such as calciumhydroxide containing substances and those reacting indirectly such as cements and unslaked limes. Fly ashes are generally held to be pozzolanic i.e. in water they react with calciumhydroxide and subsequently harden. Practice shows that such hardening proceeds very slowly and that there exist quite a few fly ashes that do not or hardly harden at all although such fly ashes do absorb a large quantity of calciumhydroxide. It is now the aim of the invention to provide a process of pretreating a pozzolanic material, particularly fly ashes in such a way that in conjunction with calciumhydroxide containing substances and water, conceivably in the presence of other substances, this leads to hardenable mixtures attaining very high degrees of strength after hardening. According to the invention this aim is attained in that a process of increasing the pozzolanic properties of a pozzolanic material particularly a fly ash is characterized in that during the action of water upon a mixture of pozzolanic material and calciumoxyde and or calciumhydroxide said mixture has or attains immediately a temperature of more than 50 C. Preferably the mixture has or immediately attains a temperature comprised between 80 and 100 C more particularly a temperature comprised between 90 and 95 C. It appears that by using a high temperature at the time of associating or bringing together the three components of the process viz. a pozzolanic material, calciumoxide and or calciumhydroxide and water pozzolanic materials, more particularly fly ashes which do not react or only react very slowly are activated so that the affinity of the pozzolanic material, particularly fly ash, in relation to calciumhydroxide is effected in a very favourable manner. The pretreated product as obtained according to the invention can be used for manufacturing building materials, making a binding agent for absorbing and occluding noxious substances or for absorbing chemical compounds to be introduced into a process. The strengths of the hardened binder, the combination of pretreated pozzolanic material more particularly fly ash, calciumhydroxide containing substance, water and conceivably other substances can be brought to a very high value by proper composition. Use of the pretreated pozzolanic material, more particularly fly ash, in cement also provides better results as with non pretreated fly ash. For the use in cement such fly ash has only to be subjected to a pretreatment, and subsequently a proper drying so that the fly ash is obtained in powder form suitable for mixing with cement. The strenghts of hardened mixtures of pretreated fly ash, calciumhydroxide containing substance and water is of the same level as obtained by hardening mixtures of ground granulated blast furnace slag material and calciumhydroxide containing substance and water. Applying the process according to the invention for manufacturing building materials wherein fly ash is bound directly boils down to the fly ash being pretreated during the mixing of ash, lime and water which is preferably added in the form of hot water and possibly another substance or other substances whereupon the mass is made into a granular material or into the shape of the building material desired in order to be subsequently hardened. Moreover the pretreatment method according to the invention offers the possibility of being able to combine fly ash better with cement and affords an extended range of the applicability of fly ashes. The binding agent, the mixture of pretreated fly ash, water and lime can also be used for agglomerating a waste product of blast furnace operations such as oxysludge and for pelletizing or briquetting phosphate ore or bauxite containing substances, to which fly ash may be considered to belong as well. Furthermore the binding agent is also quite suitable for the treatment of other substances. Variation in the amount of calciumhydroxide to be incorporated in the mixture of pretreated fly ash, calciumhydroxide and water does not change the strengths of the hardened binder. Generally speaking depending upon the hardening conditions, the amount of calciumoxide in the binder may vary from some by weight to about 20 by weight. Many compounds may be incorporated in the binder. Some of these substances are gypsum of the phosphoric acid preparation or from the flue gas desulfuration, harbour sludge etc. Soil containing impurities, waste from sewage purification, phosphate ore, iron ore, finally divided metal and metal compounds, carbon black, cokes or combinations of some of these substances, oxycalciumhydroxide sludge or oxysludge. The invention will be illustrated by means of some examples. A mixture of 93 kg cold fly ash from a coal fired power plant, 7 kg slaked calciumoxide mainly consisting of calciumhydroxide is mixed with 20 kg of water at a temperature of 20 C. After mixing the mixture is granulated by adding some additional water. The granules as obtained are cured in a steam atmosphere of 95 C for 8 hours. The same mixture as mentioned hereinbefore is prepared but the way of mixing is different. First of all the fly ash is mixed dry with the slaked lime and the whole is brought to a temperature of about 92 C in a double walled mixer. The water as used has a temperature of 95 C. The hot water and the heated mixture are then associated and mixed. Hardening is executed in the same way as hereinbefore in a steam atmosphere of 95 C for 8 hours. After hardening the grain strength of the grains from the sieve fraction 10 13 mm is in the first case 25 kg while by applying a heated mixture and heated water the grainstrength amounts to 70 kg. The grain strength is determined by placing a grain between two plates and subsequently exerting a pressure upon one of the plates. The point load pressure causing break of the grain is determined. Two mixtures are prepared but instead of 7 kg slaked lime, 5.4 kg of unslaked lime consisting for 92 of calciumoxide is used. The temperature of the mixture does not rise above 65 C. In a comparative experiment the components are heated as described in example I so that during mixing from the first contact of the fly ash with the water the temperature was raised above 80 C. Duo to the reaction heat emitted by the reaction of unslaked lime and water the temperature rises very rapidly and calciumhydroxide dissolves so that the reactions forming the basis for the later strength in the product are able to proceed above 90 . The grains obtained from the non preheated mixture present a grain strength of 18 kg while the grains obtained from the preheated mixture present a strength of 88 kg. Instead of 7 kg slaked lime as in example 1, 10 kg of Portland cement is used. The effect of the pretreatment occurs but is relatively smaller. Cold mixing provides grains with a grain strength of 16 kg and hot mixing provides a grain strength of 22 kg. The amount of cement in the mixture was 9 . As cement after contact with water only provides some calciumhydroxide after some hours this experiment was repeated in combination with slaked lime. For comparative purposes two mixtures are prepared consisting of The grain strength of the grains of the sieve fraction 10 13 mm has a value of 18 kg when cold mixing is used, and a mixture obtained by hot mixing provides a grain strength of 40 kg. Example III is repeated but 1 by weight of a mixture of gypsum and calciumsulfite is added to the mixture. The grain strenght is 22 kg when cold mixing is used and in the case of hot mixing a temperature of the mixture comprised between 90 C and 100 C immediately as water contacts the mixture 58 kg. In a mixer the temperature of the fly ash is increased by introducing steam. After having reached a sufficiently high temperature hot water of 98 C is added to the mixture of ash and condensed water 4 . The amount of unslaked lime amounted to 5.5 by weight based on the weight of the dry ash. The temperature during the contact of the water with the different components was 91 C as some steam escaped from the mixer. After mixing the mixture is stored for some time in a container and subsequently granulated. A part of the granules is stored in the air and another part is hardened by means of a heat treatment by steam as described in example I. The granules obtained from a mixture prepared by mixing at increased temperature have a grain strength sieve fraction from 10 13 mm of 79 kg. The granules hardened under air present a strength of 54 kg after two weeks storage under air which is already sufficient for many applications in concrete. Here the increase of strength depends on the time. Already after one week a grain strength of 36 kg is obtained. The temperature of the mixture in the mixer is not brought in the right range so that the temperature is below 50 C. Hardened granules only provide a grain strength of 30 kg whilst the granules stored in the air present a grain strength of 14 kg after one year. A mixture obtained by hot mixing of 9,5 kg fly ash and 5 kg slaked lime is dried and stored for some time. After grinding the material is mixed with Portland cement in a ratio of 1 1. A part of this mixture is subsequently mixed with sand in the ratio 30 mixture and 70 sand. From the mixture a cube of 7 x 7 x 7 cm is pressed. This cube is hardened. A second cube is manufactured from a mixture of 70 sand and 30 blast furnace cement which cube is hardened in the same way as the first cube. The strength of the cube obtained from fly ash amounts to 380 kg cm² whilst the cube obtained from blast furnace cement has a strength of 360 kg cm². This result is very remarkable as literature describes many experiments with fly ashes which only show a very small increase of strength by replacing small amounts of cement by this mixture or even descreases of strength. Phosphoric acid waste gypsum is mixed with fly ash in the ratio of e.g. 1 1. By blowing steam through this mixture in a mixer the temperature is increased to about 94 C. Subsequently calciumoxide is added and the whole amount of hot water is rapidly introduced into the mixer by instantaneously opening the valve of a container containing said water. Subsequently the material is granulated, the grain strength of the granules of the sieve fraction 10 13 mm is 80 kg. Cold mixing of such a mixture provides granules having a strength of only 40 kg.
