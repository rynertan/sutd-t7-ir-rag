# Apparatus for shaping plastic foams.

## Abstract
A foamable extrudate is extruded through the orifice 25 , preferably arcuate, of an extrusion die 24 . Immediately adja cent and downstream of the die orifice are opposed sets of curved rollers 47, 48 , each having substantially the same cen ter of curvature as the die orifice. The roller set 48 on one side of the extrudate pass line is adjustable as a set with re spect to and substantially parallel to the pass line, while the rollers of the set 47 on the opposite side are adjustable indi vidually cach to float with controlled pressure against the ex trudate as it expands and moves between the roller sets. Each roller is comprised of a plurality of thin, cylindrical, circular wa fers 195 which are drivingly interconnected and journaled on curved cure shafts 50 . The wafers of opposed rollers in each set are individually driven for rotation at a controlled speed so that each opposed pair of rolls acts as a traction drive for the extrudate as it exits radially from the die orifice, such rollers controlling the expansion and movement of the extrudate while minimizing cell distortion. A surface finisher 45 is pro vided downstream of the roll sets which comprises opposed extrudate engaging planar surfaces 120, 121 positioned on the opposite sides of the extrudate, one 121 being adjustably yet fixedly supported while the other 120 is adjustably and floatingly supported pivotally at its center of gravity to exert a controlled flating pressure on the extrudate.
