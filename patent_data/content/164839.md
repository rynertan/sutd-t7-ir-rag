# Weighing scales.

## Abstract
A bathroom scale has a load receiving platform 1 on which a user can stand and display means 8 . Weight on the platform 1 is transferred to a stainless steel force plate 3 mounted on a base member 2 and having double encastred beams 42 formed by cutouts 43 . The beams 42 are supported on knife edge support members 52 , and a plurality of piezo electric strain gauges 44 to 47 are screen printed on an insulating coating on the beams 42 of the force plate adjacent the positions at which the force plate is supported on the support members 52 . Deformation of the beams 42 as a result of weight on the platform 1 produces electrical signals which are summed to form 8 composite load signal as a weight reaing. Summing the electrical signals from the strain gauges electrically, avoids many of the disadvantages and errors associated with scales which utilise a mechanical linkage to sum weight components.
