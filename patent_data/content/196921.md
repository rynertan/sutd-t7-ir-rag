# RECOMBINANT HUMAN RENIN

## Abstract
Expression vectors and methods for effecting the pro duction of recombinant renin, prorenin, and preprorenin are disclosed. Sufficient quantities are thus obtained to generate pharmaceuticals useful in the treatment of disorders medi ated by excessive renin levels such as hypertension. Methods to purify renin and prorenin from cell supernatants and to increase mature renin secretion are also disclosed.
