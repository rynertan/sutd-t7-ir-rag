# HYBRID CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A hybrid circuit 38 having high return loss and high transhybrid loss is disclosed. An operational amplifier 39 is employed in a feedback configuration. The receive port 30 of the hybrid circuit is applied to the non inverting input of the amplifier while the center tap of the secondary winding of the hybrid transformer is applied to the inverting input of the amplifier. Most noticeable is the omission of an impedance setting resistor at the output of the operational amplifier. The circuitry connected to the transmit port 29 and the two wire bidirectional port 24 of the hybrid circuit are of con ventional design.
