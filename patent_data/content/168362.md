# REGULATING MEANS FOR CONTROLLING THE SUPPLY OF HEAT TO A CONFINED SPACE, AND MEANS FOR ESTABLISHING WHEN THE HEATING REQUIREMENT OF AN AIR MASS EXCEEDS PRE DETERMINED VALUE, AND BY HOW MUCH

## Abstract
A regulating arrangement intended for supplying heat to a confined space, including a heating source 13 , a regulat ing means 12 intended for regulated heat supply from the heat source, a device for detecting one or a plurality of measurement values and connected 12a, 12b to the regulating means, which in dependence on received mea surement values regulates the amount of heat delivered by the heating source. The regulating means 12 is controlled 10b by a device arranged to detect the actual heating requirement of the ventilation air at that moment in time, or for detecting a part of this heat requirement. There is also provided an arrangement or a device for establishing when the requirement to heat an air mass to achieve a pre determined temperature increase exceeds a pre determined heating requirement and by how much, by causing the air mass an energy delivering means 4 and establishing the energy taken up by the air mass and the heat content of the mass at the moment in time. The energy taken up by the air mass is compared with a theoretically and or empirically established energy uptake applicable to an air mass having a pre determined heating requirement or a pre determined water content in liquid phase, there being evaluated from the established energy difference the actual higher and or lower heating requirement of the air at the moment in time.
