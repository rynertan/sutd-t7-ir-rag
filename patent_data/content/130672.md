# Sorption fractionation process for olefin separation.

## Abstract
A continuous fractionation process for recovering ethy lene from a volatile olefinic feedstock comprising C₃ higher olefins comprises contacting the olefinic feedstock in a counter current sorption tower with a liquid sorbent stream comprising C₆ gasoline range hydrocarbons to se lectively sorb substantially the entire C₃ olefin components from the feedstock, withdrawing an ethylene rich gas stream from the sorption tower and further contacting the ethylene rich stream with a distillate range liquid hydrocar bon stream in a sponge absorber to purify the ethylene stream. The olefinic feedstock preferably comprises about 10 to 50 mole ethylene and 10 to 50 mole propene. Pu rified ethylene product may be recovered having an aver age molecular weight not greater than 28.5 under non cryo genic conditions.
