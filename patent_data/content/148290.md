## Description
Method and device at the analysis of liquid samplesThe present invention relates to a method used as a preparatory step in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of liquid samples and is particularly valuable, when the substance to be determined is present in a low concentration. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method. By using the method and the device according to the invention even small amounts of microorganisms can be determined in liquid samples. The invention is also suitable for the determination of airborne microorganisms being coLlected in an appropriate liquid, usually water, before the analysis thereof.In the analysis of a liquid sample, and particularly a water sample, as regards to its content of microorganisms it takes a long time before a reply can be obtained if the microorganisms must be cultivated.Therefore it is desirable to obtain a method of analysis that will give a more rapid reply. A big problem is that often there are too low concentrations of microorganisms for the use of for instance a biochemical method for the determination of the amount of microorganisms. Here an important step is to concentrate the microorganisms of the sample to be analyzed. There are methods available to concentrate microorganisms on filters but these methods are not automatic.By means of the method and the device of the invention a continuous automatic concentration is obtained of the substance to be determined in the liquid sample, making it possible to carry out the analysis with a great accuracy even when using simple methods of analysis. The characteristics of the invention are evident from the subsequent patent claims.The invention will now be described in more detail to an illustrative but not delimiting purpose with reference to the attached drawings, where Figs. 1 3 show three embodiments of the device according to the invention for an automatic concentration of, for instance, microorganisms in a liquid sample before the analysis thereof.The device of Fig. 1 comprises a filter 3 in the form of a movable filter tape that is brought to pass through two filter holders 4, 7.Each filter holder consists of an upper part 5, 8 and a lower part 6, 9. The upper parts of the filter holders are arranged in a common Lid situated above the filter while the lower parts of the filter holders are arranged in a common seat situated below the filter.The liquid sample that is to be analyzed, is supplied by means of a peristaltic pump to the first filter holder 4 through an intake 1 connected to the upper part 5. The filter is permeable to the liquid vehicle of the sample causing the sample content of the substance that is to be determined, for instance microorganisms, to become concentrated on the filter while the filtrate is caused to pass through the lower part 6 of the filter holder through an outlet 2 into a waste.After concentration has been carried out, the lid with the upper part 5 is lifted up and the filter with microorganisms is automatically moved forwards to the second filter holder 7. The automatic movement forwards of the filter is achieved by means of an operation unit. The lid is closed again, and a liquid being suitable for the elution of the microorganisms is pumped in from preferably the underneath side of the filter through the inlet 10. The microorganisms that have been concentrated on the upper side of the filter are thus eluted into the liquid and are removed from the device through the outlet 11 for a rapid determination thereof, for instance by means of a chemiluminescence analysis in a coventional manner.In the device of Fig. 2 the second filter holder 7 is in the form of a measuring unit. It is here possible to carry out a direct analysis of the concentrated sample by means of for instance chemiluminescence. Reagents for luminescence analysis are being injected into the measuring unit 12 through an inlet 13, for instance luminol 13a, perborate 13b and sodium hydroxide 13c. The emitted light is observed by means of a detector, for instance a photomultiplier tube 12a. With certain predetermined analysis conditions the emitted light is a measure of the amount of microorganisms. In the device of Fig. 3 the second filter holder 7 is in the form of a punch. Said punch 15 cuts out that part of the filter, on which the sample has been concentrated, and so the filter falls down into a container 16, in which container the analysis can be carried out in a conventional manner. The container 16 may be a petri dish with a nutrient medium for microorganisms. It is then possible to carry out conventional microbiological cultivation, for instance in accordance with the standards that are established for water samples.In the description above the concentration is carried out semicontinuously. The invention also makes it possible to carry out the concentration and the analysis altogether continuously.
