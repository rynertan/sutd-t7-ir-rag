# HIGH POWER MULTIPLEXER FOR DUAL POLARIZED FREQUENCY REUSE EARTH STATIONS

## Abstract
A modular arrangement of directional RF filters provides frequency multiplexing of signal sources at earth stations which are transmitting on two orthogonal polarizations. Each of the modules consist of a pair of 3dB hybrid couplers coupled to each other through identical bandpass filters such that a signal applied to one of two input ports is outputed exclusively through an associated one of two output ports. The passbands of each of the modules are mutually exclu sive. The output ports of each module are coupled to an output port of two adjacent modules, and two main outputs are taken from the two outer modules. The signals from the two main outputs are applied to two antennas having mutually orthogonal polarizations. The present invention may also be used as a demultiplexing receiver.
