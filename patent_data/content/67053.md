# Synchronisation of electrical oscillators.

## Abstract
A system for synchronising remote or colocated oscil lators is constructed with redundancy enabling a high degree of fault toleration. In the various embodiments of the system there is no predetermined hierarchy amongst the oscillators in contrast to the prior art master and slave type of synchronisation. Averaging is not involved and the sys tem settles to a state in which the oscillators are locked to one master, which is not predetermined. Each oscillator is part of a terminal which includes reconfiguration circuitry, and each, in the absence of faults, is connected to each of the other terminals. The terminals attempt to lock to another oscillator and reconfigure in accordance with an algorithm until stable synchronisation is achieved. In one embodiment the properties of a phase locked loop are utilised in a novel way by incorporating a variable delay in its feed back path. Using this circuitry enables one embodiment to achieve synchronisation even when only indirect paths exist to the assumed master, and in the system temporary disconnection for reconfiguration is not necessary.
