# Heat wire type airflow quantity measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
A heater 12 , which comprises an element whose resis tance varies with changes in temperature, and a temperature element 13 are provided in the air intake pipe 11 of an en gine. This heater and temperature element together with resis tors 14, 15, 16 from a bridge circuit to which heating power is supplied via a transistor 17 . An engine control unit 20 gen erates start signals Tin simultaneously with the rotation of the engine. A flip flop circuit 19 is set by these start signals and, when set, the transistor 17 is turned on and the heating power rises. The output signal from the bridge circuit is sup plied to a comparator 18 and the output signal of the compa rator 18 resets the flip flop circuit 19 , which outputs a pulse shaped signal representing the airflow quantity as a length of time. This pulse shaped time signal is sent via a con stant current circuit 21 to another comparator 22 , where it is compared with a reference voltage and the output signal from the comparator 22 , is supplied together with the above time signal to an exclusive OR circuit 25 . This exclusive OR circuit 25 , outputs a first and second pulse signal as the mea surement output signal Tout synchronously with the rise and fall of the time signal and this signal is supplied to the engine control unit.
