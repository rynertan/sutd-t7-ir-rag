# Program controlled bus arbitration for a distributed array processing system.

## Abstract
A distributed array processing system includes a bus di vided into two portions or segments by a switch. One segment is connected to a processor and to a bus arbiter for controlling use of the bus. The bus arbiter provides one source of bus grant signals. A control register provides a second source of bus grant signals and additional signals for disabling the arbiter and actuating the switch. The control register is software controlled, i.e., it is loadable with data or control signals, under program control, to control use of the bus.
