## Description
THIS invention relates to an agricultural method and implement. More particularly the invention relates to a method and implement for locating an agrtcul tural material such as, for exanple, fertilizers, agricultural lime, etc., deep in the soil in zurich a particular crop is to be planted.It is often, for various reasons, required to locate a particular agricultural material at substantial depths below ground surface. Thus, for example, in a typically arid environment, it may be advisable to locate a fertilizer or the like at such deep depths in order to compel the roots of a crop planted on the surface to penetrate deeply into the soil in order to develop a strong root system which will not only help to anchor the grown plant firmly but which will also ensure that the plant will be able to reach a low water table during in draught conditions.Another instance where such a deep depositing of agrib cultural material may be required Is, for example, where there is an aluminium poisoned sand layer present immediately below the ground surface through which the roots of a crop planted on the surface have to penetrate in order to reach a water table located below the sand layer. In such instances it is ne pessary for agricultural lime to be deposited in the said sand layer to combat the poisonous effect of the aluminium compounds contained in it. Most of the hitherto known methods for such deep deposition of agricultural material entail the making of a deep groove or furrow in the soil, usually by means of a ripper tire or the like, and then merely causing the material to fall into the furrow under the influence of gravity.One disadvantage found with such known methods is that the drawn furrow often closes up faster than what the material can be deposited in it with the result that such material is not laid down An the furrow at the intended depth,This is especially the case where the material being deposited is relatively light such, as for example, when it comprises agricultural litre or the like. Another disadvantage found with the known methods is that the material being deposited is laid down as a relatively narrow band in the bottom of the furrow while the ideal positioning would be as a wader band extending over at least a substantial part of the furrow in the vertical direction.It has been suggested to deposit such material in such u furrow by means of a material conveying conduit extending to the bottom of the furrow and operated compressed air or the like but, apart from the fact that the apparatus required for carrying out such an operation is relatively complicated and hence expensive1 certain other problems relating, for ex ample, to the relatively light weight of such matey rial, has ensured that this type of operation has hitherto not found wide acceptance.It is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for locating agrl cultural materials deep down below the soil surface with which the aforesaid problems will be overcome or at least minimized. According to the invention a method for locating an agricultural material in the below the ground surf ace including the steps of passing an elongated conduit having at least one outlet towards its lower end lengthwise into a furrow or the like drawn in the soil and forcing the material to pass down the conduit and out through the outlet by means of a mechanically operated conveyer.With this arrangement the conduit maybe so located in the furrow that the outlet is at tne required depth at which the material has to be deposited in the furrow. Furthermore, by employing a conduit which includes a plurality of outlets spaced over its length, the material may be deposited as u wide band extending over a substantial part of the furrow in thrveht1 a direction. Preferably the method includes the steps of drawing a furrow in the soil by means of a ripper tine or the like, and passing the material depositing conduit into the furrow inwnadiately behind the tine0Preferably also the method includes the step of causing soil in the immediate vicinity of the furrow to pass into the furrow to cover the material as soon as the latter has been deposited in the furrow.Further according to the invention an Implement for depositing an agricultural material in soil below ground surf ace including a conduit and adapted to pass length wise into a furrow or the like drawn into the soil, the conduit having at least one outlet towards its lower end a mechanically operated conveyer for carrying such material down the conduit and out through the outlet into the furrow.Still further according to the invention the conduit includes a plurality of outlets spaced axially over its length4Preferably the apertures are arranged in two parallel extending rows, the apertures in each row Increasing in size from the top aperture towards the bottom aperture.Further according to the invention each aperture is associated with a platform which is located iminedia tely below the aperture and which extends transversely the conduit.These platforms serve to scatter material falling from an aperture onto them in the horizontal direction so enlarging the transverse width of the band of material which is deposited in the furrow. Further according to the invention the means for conveying the material down the conduit comprises an elongated worm gear which is rotatably contained within the bore of the conduit.With this arrangement material passing into the upper end of the conduit is carried by the threads of the worm gear towards the lower end of the conduit. As such material reaches an aperture in the conduit, the material is foroed out through such aperture into the furrow, The worm gear may be driven in any suitable manner,Preferably the worm gear is driven through the rota tfon of a land engageable wheel associated with the implement. Such rotation may, for example, be effected through a chain extending between a sprocket on such a wheel and a sprocket mounted on a shaft which is rotatably connected to the worm war. If required, the land engageable wheel may be biased towards engagement with the ground surface. Such basins means mny, for example, comprise e suitable spring or the like extending between the wheel, or its mounting, and the implement.In another form of the invention the conduit s mate rial conveying means comprises a device adapted to cause a vibration in the conduit sufficient to cause the material to pass down the conduit4 Further according to the invention the implement may include a container in which the material to be fed into the furrow is held1 and into which the upper end of the conduit passes. still further according to the invention the imple ment includes a ripper tine adapted to draw a furrow in the soil, the said conduit being mounted In close trailing relatfonship relative to the tine with the lower end of the conduit being located at substantially the same level as the lower end of the tine.With this arrangement the material may be deposited in the furrow immediately behind the tine and hence before any significant amount of soil fran the fure row surroundings can start to fall into the furrow. Preferably the lower end of the worm gear extends a small distance beyond the lower end of the conduit.Such an arrangement helps to prevent the conduit fran becoming clogged. up with material.Further according to the invention the implement includes a furrow closing niember which is mounted on the implement in trailing relationship to the conduit,A furrow closing ber preferably includes an elongated element adapted to pass into the furrow and one or more projections extending transversely the element which are adapted to rake soil into the furrow as the element moves along the furrow. If required, the implement may also include a compactins wheel in the trailing relationship to the furrow closing member, the wheel being adapted to press soil which has been racked back into the furrow by the said member firmly down into the furrow.Further according to the invention the implementIncludes a frame on which the various aforesaid components are mounted and which can be draw by a tractor or the like.Preferably the frame is adapted to be coupled to the three point hitching mechanism of a tractor or the like.The invention will now be described further by way of example with reference to the enclosed drawings wherein Figure 1 is a diagramnatic side view of one embodi ment of an implement according to the invention Figure 2 is a front view of the apparatus shown in figure 1 as seen in the direction of arrow II in figure 1 Figure 3 As a plan view of the apparatus of fl gures 1 and 2 as seen in the direction of arrow III in figure 1 F igure 4 is a rear view of the apparatus shown in the previous figures as seen in the direction of arrow IV in figure It and Figure 5 is a diagrammatic perspective view showing part of the apparatus of the previous figures in more detail.In this embodiment of the invention the implement includes a metal frame which is defined by a hori zontally extending beam I of which the one end is connected to a ripper tine 2 by means of a vertically extending been 3.The other end of beam I is connected to a horizontally extending been 4 and a vertically extending pair of interconnected beams 5 are mounted on its centre,A frame assembly 6, mounted on beam I, serves to support a container 7 of which the sides of taper towards includes a substantially centrally located outlet aperture 8 which is located In the bottom of container 7 and into which the upper end of an elongated conduit 9 extends frcm below.The material intended to be deposited in the soil by the implement is introduced to container 7 through the open end 10 thereof.Conduit 9, of which the lower end extends to substantally the same level as tine 2, is connected by means of a substantially triangularly shaped plate 11 to the rear end of beam 3. Plate 11 is also connected to a horizontally extending elongated beam 12 which, In turn, has its one end connected to beam 1. The other end of bean 12 is connected to a vertically extending elongated member 13 which Includes a scoop 14 towards its lower end and which Is provided over its length with a plurality of transversely extending raking elements 15. Member 13 is located substantially in linear trailing relationship relative to bean 3.An elongated worm gear 16 is rotatably received in the bore of conduit 9. The lower end of worm gear 16 extends a short distance beyond the lower end of conduit 9 while the upper end of worm gear 16 extends a substantial distance into the interior of container 7. Worm gear 16 includes towards its upper end a bevelled gear 17 which merges with another bevelled gear 18 whIch is carried on a shaft 19 which is rotatably received in a bearing 20 mounted on the side wall of container 7. A sprocket 21 which is connected to the free end of shaft 19 is rotatably linked by means of a chain 22 to a sprocket 23 which is carried on the shaft of a land engeagable wheel 24 which includes transversely extending tsrcumveren tially spaced formations 25 over its outer periphery intended to improve the grip of wheel 24 on the ground surface. Wheel 24 is rotatably received between the two ends of arms 26 of which the other ends are secured to the main frame of the implement.Wheel 24 is so mounted that it runs on one side of the implement.Conduit 9 is provided along its rear end with two parralel spaced rows of apertures 27 which decrease in size fran the top apertures towards the bottom apertures.Each aperture 27 is associated with a transversely extending projection 28 which is located immediately below the aperture and which defines a platform onto which material passing from inside conduit 9 via aperture 27 can fall. 8eam 4 is provided at each of its apposite ends with a pin 29 which, together with a pair of aligned apertures 30 in the upper end of beam 5, serve as the connecting means intended for coupling the implement to the three point hitching mechanism of a tractor or the like not shown . Struts 31 serve to re Inforce the connection of beams 1 and 5 to the frame of the Implement. A wire mesh 32, which is provided over the open end 10 of container 7, ensures that only material smaller than a particular particle size can pass into container 7.A lid 33, provided In the rear side wall of container 7 allows access to the inside of container of 7 for inspection purposes.A pair of removable legs 34 serve to support the implement in the upright position when It is not in use.In use, container 7 is filled with the particular material to be deposited in the soil the Implement hitched to the rear end of a tractor or the like and legs 34 removed. When the implement is located in the particular area where the material has to be deposited in the soil, the tractor s hitch meganism Is operated to allow tine 2 and wheel 24 to engage the soil surface When the implement is then drawn over the surface, tine 2 penetrates the soils to draw a deep groove or furrow into the it. At the same time, because of the rotational engagement between wheel 24 and the ground surface, shaft 197 and hence worm gear 16, is rotated, he e on worm gear 16 serve to carry the material located in container 7 through outlet 8 into the bore of conduit 9.Any of such material passing on apertures 27 in conduit 9, Is forced out through it to fall onto its associated platform 28 whIch serves to scatter such material in the horizontal direction. The material is accordingly deposited in the furrow rtn a relatively wide band which extends substantially fran the upper end of the furrow vertically downward to the lower end of the furrow. Trailing member 13 with its scoop 14 and rake ele ments 15 immediately draws soil located in the Imme diate vicinity of the furrow into the furrow to cover the deposited material.If required, a further wheel located in linear trail Ing relationship to member 13 may be provided for pressing down firmly the raked back soil in the furrow.Applicant has found that it is possible with the implement to deposit agricultural material to a depth in the order of 9OOmm below ground surfc The applicant has furthermore found that a crop raised under severe draught conditions in soil treated With, say, a particular fertilizer by means of the imple ment according to the invention, was substantially better than a crop raised under similar conditions but with the fertilizer being deposited in the soil in the conventional manner. It will be appreciated that the rate at which a particular material may be deposited in the soil can be changed by varying the speed of rotation of worm gear 16 and or the sizes of apertures 27.It will be appreciated further that there are many variations in detail possible with a method and apparatus according to the invention without de parting from the scope of the appended claims.Thus, for example, instead of driving worm gear 16 by means of ground engageable wheel 24, a motor may be utilised for this purpose. Also, If required, the concentration of the deposited material in any par ticular zone in the furrow may be varied by changing the size of the apertures 27 in conduit 9 in such zone. It will also be appreciated that instead of being a solid, the material deposited may also be inIn a liquid form.
