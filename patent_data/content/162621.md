## Description
A COOKING BOE TFgs invention relates to cooking hobs and in particular to cooking hobs having a plate of glass ceramic material set in a suitable surround. In known glass ceramic cooking hobs, it is generally necessary to secure the edge of the glass ceramic plate to the surround. To this end, the edge of the surround of some cooking hobs may be provided with a square shaped groove for retaining the edge of tbe glass ceramic plate and a rubber seal disposed between abutting edges of the plate and the inner walls of the groove. However, this method of setting the glass ceramic plate in the surround may be disadvantageous because the upper part of the groove extends over the upper surface of the glass ceramic plate, thereby obviating a flush fitting of the glass ceramic setting with the surround, which flush fitting is advantageous for cleaning purposes. To overcome this disadvantage, the glass ceramic setting within the surround of some other known cooking hobs is achieved by applying an adhesive material to the edge of the surround and the glass cersnde plate is then correctly positioned relative to the surround, so that the adhesive material causes the abutting edges of the surround and glass ceramic plate to adhere together. Any excess adhesive material is then removed from the surfaces of the surround and the glass ceramic plate. Although this latter method provides the desirable flush fitting of the cooking hob, it may however be disadvantageous in that the efficiency of the method depends considerably on proper application of the adhesive material to the surround, and furthermore subsequent replacement of the glass ceramic plate requires the surround, as well as the plate, to be replaced. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a cooking hob which overcomes both of the above mentioned disadvantages of knows cooking hobs. According to the present invention there is provided a cooking hob including a plate of glass ceramic material and a surround member therefor, support means supporting the plate in relation to the surround member, and characterised in that said support means includes flange means associated with the surround member end underlying at least selected peripheral portions of said plate, so that, when assembled, upper surfaces of the plate and of the surround member are substantially co planar, the hob further including a retaining seal, formed of resilient material, which is secured to said plate and includes a gripping portion, shaped to oo operate ith said flange means so as to be releasablp securable thereto, and an upstanding portion which is interposed between the plate and the surround member and terminates in the plane of said upper surfaces. The retaining seal may be secured to an abutting edge of the plate by a suitable adhesive. liternatively, an abutting edge of the plate may be formed with a chamfer, which is arranged to mate with a groove formed in the retaining seal. The gripping portion of the retaining member is preferably provided with a groove, within which the flange means is gripped, the flexible nature of the gripping portion enabling a lower wall, which partially defines the groove, to flex, thereby enabling the gripping portion to be released from the surround edge. The invention will now be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 shows part of a sectional view of one embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 2 shows a part of a sectional view of a second embodiment of the invention. Figure 1 shows part of a cooking hob consisting of a glass ceramic plate l, below which a number, usually four, of heating units not shown are supported, so that heat from the units is transmitted upwardly towards, and through the glass ceramic plate 1 to heat a cooking utensil placed on the upper surface of the glass ceramic plate 1. The glass ceramic plate 1 is set in a surround 2, which.may be of, for example, metal or enamelled metal, and may take the form of a frame or body of either a freestanding cooking hob or a hob mounted in a working surface. The surround 2 is provided with a flange 3 which is arranged to extend partially under the glass ceramic plate 1, when the plate is positioned within the surround 2. An upstanding portion of a retaining seal 4 is disposed between respective abutting edges of the plate 1 and the surround 2 and terminates in the plane of the upper surfaces thereof. The retaining seal is made from a resilient material, such as a suitable rubber. A lower part of the resilient seal II consists of a resilient gripping portion 5, having a groove 6 partially defined by a lower wall 7 which grips the flange 3 of the surround 2. The flexible nature of the seal X enables the lower wall 7 to flex to a position shown in dotted lines at 7a, thereby enabling the gripping portion 5 to be released from the flange 3, so that the seal 4 can be removed from the surround 2. In Figure 1, the glass ceramic plate 1 is adhered to contacting surfaces s of the seal II by a suitable adhesive, so that the gripping action of portion 5 of the seal 4 retains both the seal 9 and the glass ceramic plate 1 within the surround 2. Upon release of the gripping portion 5, from the flange 3, by flexure of the lower wall 7 to position 7a, both the glass ceramic plate 1 and the seal 4 are released from the surround 2. In Figure 2, wherein like parts are labelled with like reference nranerals with respect to Figure 1, the glass ceramic plate 1 is formed with a chamfer 8, which is arranged to mate with a corresponding groove 9 in the seal 4. The glass ceramic plate 1 may thus be secured to the seal 4 in a releasable manner, without being permanently adhered thereto, as in the embodiment shown in Figure It can be seen that both of the embodiments shown in theFigures provide a flush fitting between the upper surfaces of the glass ceramic plate 1, the seal 4 and the surround 2 making cooking bobs in accordance with the present invention advantageous for cleaning purposes, whilst the gripping portion 5, beneath the plate 1, retains the plate 1 within the surround 2 in a relatively easily releasable manner, as well as providing firm support for the plate 1. The seal 4 is typically made from a material which is sufficiently hard and flexible to enable the cooking hob to be assembled with the use of a suitable tool, whilst being sufficiently rigid to retain the glass ceramic plate 1 within the surround 2 during use of the cooking hob. The seal 4 may be provided in the form of either of the embodiments shown, around some or all of the sides of the glass ceramic plate abutting with the surround, and the flange 3 may be provided accordingly at appropriate locations on the sides of the surround.
