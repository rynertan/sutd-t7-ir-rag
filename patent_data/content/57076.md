# Apparatus for detecting and measuring trace gases in air or other gaseous background.

## Abstract
The gas detection apparatus includes a housing 10 defining a passage for flow of gas through a drift region 30, 35, 50 , a source of ionizing radiation 14 positioned at the front end of the passage, a collector electrode 70 mounted within the passage to collect ions reaching the rear end of the passage, a voltage divider network 40, 60 establishing a substantially linear drift potential in the housing to cause the ions to move through the drift region from radiation source to collector electrode, and a grid 31 for gating discrete packets of ions into the drift region. The improvement comprising means 45 operable to vary the drift potential as a function of atmospheric pressure, premitting the improved identification of a particular compound at varying altitudes.
