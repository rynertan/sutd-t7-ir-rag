# A LOUDSPEAKER UNIT

## Abstract
For a good and efficient sound reproduction from a loudspeaker unit it is prescribed that two woofers are arranged back to back, one on a front plate of the unit and the other on an internal partion plate, whereby a front compart ment of the unit operates as an effective bass reflection system, while a closed rear compartment contributes, via the rear loudspeaker, to improve the quality of the reproduced sound. The back to back arrangement of the two loudspeak ers results in a non vibrating unit.
