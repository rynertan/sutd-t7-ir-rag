# Moving bed gas treating process.

## Abstract
A gas treating process for simultaneous solid particle filtering and sulfur oxide removal is described. The feed gas stream 3 is passed horizontally through a first moving bed 4, 5 of treating particles, which trap fine particles entrained in the gas stream. The treating particles of the bed also are effective in removing sulfur oxides by reaction with the sulfur oxides. The effluent of the first moving bed is passed through an upper second moving bed 8,9 of fresh treating particles. Preferably the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the effluent of the first bed is monitored to control either, and possibly both, the rate at which gas bypasses the second bed or the rate at which the treating particles are transferred from the second to the first beds.
