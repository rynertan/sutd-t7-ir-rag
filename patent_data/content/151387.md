# Lubricating structure of differential carrier for vehicle.

## Abstract
A lubricating structure of a differential carrier comprises a drive pinion shaft attaching portion 12, an oil supply hole 14 and an oil return hole 16 extended respectively along and provided on both sides of the attaching portion 12 and a ring gear attaching portion 18 formed to extend the axis of a ring gear 54 in the direction crossing these holes. A gap S₂ between a portion 52 located on the lower side of the oil supply hole 14 in a member 20 surrounding the ring gear attaching portion 18 and the ring gear 54 disposed in the attaching portion 18 is formed larger than that S₁ between a portion 53 located on the upper side of the oil supply hole 14 in the member 20 and the ring gear 54. The oil supply hole 14 is formed to give an inclination downward in front when the differential carrier 10 is mounted on a car body.
