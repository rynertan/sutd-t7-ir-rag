# Diskette drive and media type determination mechanism.

## Abstract
Diskette media and drive determination mechanism in which a diskette controller attempts to read the diskette according to a variety of formats having, for instance, different data transfer rates. A successful read is registered by the controller and that format is thereafter identified with the diskette drive and the diskette media inserted in the drive.
