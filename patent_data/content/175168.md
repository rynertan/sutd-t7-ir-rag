# Method and apparatus for grinding the slide surface of skates.

## Abstract
An automatic sharpening of the slide surface of a skate to desired profile with regard to at least two dimensions x and y in a coordinate system is disclosed. A grinding wheel 18, 119 is by guide means 14, 15 movable in x direction in the longitudinal direction of the slide surface and by guide means 20, 11 movable in y direction. Frstly, a scanning of the existing profile of the slide surface is carried out by means of the grinding wheel which with a substantially constant abutment pressure forceably is moved along the slide surface, during which movement the x and y coor dinates of the profile are continuously recorded in a mem ory. After eventual correction of the coordinates in the mem ory the grinding is carried out by forcing the grinding wheel in rotating state to repeat the recorded coordinates upon impulses from the memory.
