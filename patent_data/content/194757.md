# Manufacture of porous resin molded product, and casting mold of porous resin.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for obtaining a porous resin molded product containing continuous holes characterised by using as the molding material a mixture which includes epoxy compound having one or more epoxy groups in each molecule hardener which reacts with and hardens the epoxy compound at least two types of monionic emulsifier selected from the three types having respective hydrophilic lipophilic balances of 4 8, 8 17, and 11 15.6 water or aqueous surface active agent and filler. The invention also provides a mold suitable for slip discharge casting and obtained by the above defined pro cess according to the invention, preferably using a said a molding material which contains 20 50 parts by weight of hardener per 100 parts by weight of epoxy compound, 30 parts by weight or less of emulsifier and 1 20 parts by weight of water or aqueous surface active agent to 100 parts by weight in total of epoxy compound and hardener and 30 75 weight percent of filler.
