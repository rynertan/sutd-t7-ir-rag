# Loop coronary catheter.

## Abstract
A coronary catheter has a transverse loop 22 at the distal end 21 of the catheter with at least one and preferably two spaced, outwardly directed groups of openings 24, 26 centered to align with blood flow to respective coronary ostia when the catheter is in a maximum radius of curvature in the aorta. Each group of openings 24, 26 is spaced over a region of the outer peripheral wall of the loop 22 so as to direct a fan like pattern of contrast medium toward the aorta wall at the situs of the corresponding coronary ostium or directly upstream therefrom.
