# Crystalline propylene polymer composition.

## Abstract
A crystalline polypylene composition comprises a blend of a crystalline polypropylene homo or random or block co polymer of propylene and b 0.005 to 10,000 ppm by wt. of a polymer of a vinyl cycloalkane having at least 6 C atoms, e.g. vinyl cyclopentane or cyclohexane. The propylene may be copolymerized with up to 50 mol of another C2 18 α olefin. The cycloalkane may be copolymerized with up to 20 mol of another vinyl cycloal kane or an α olefin. Both polymers may be produced using a Ti compound and organoaluminium compound as catalyst system. Additives can be present the composition can be molded, e.g. to form a sheet. The composition has good optical transparency and rigidity.
