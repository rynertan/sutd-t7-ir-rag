## Abstract
A nuclear reactor system wherein a prestressed con crete reactor vessel 23 is provided with a main cavity for the reactor core and at least one subsidiary cavity 21 for a steam generator. At least two feedwater penetrations 48 are provided in the reactor vessel communicating between the exterior of the reactor vessel and the subsidiary cylin drical cavity. A superheater penetration 52 is provided aligned with the axis of the cavity with the feedwater pene trations and the superheater penetration having mutually parallel axes. Superheater outlet means 55 are positioned in the superheater penetration and include a tubesheet 113 positioned a substantial distance from both the sub sidiary cylindrical cavity and the exterior of the reactor vessel.
