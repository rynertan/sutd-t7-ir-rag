# Signal analysing circuit for a periodically occuring signal.

## Abstract
A signal analysing circuit for a periodically occurring signal, supplied by, for example, a video signal source VSS . The circuit comprises a store M having separate store locations M , which are associated with corresponding regions arranged in rows and columns on picture display of the periodically occurring video signal. In addition, a time signal generator TG is provided for the synchronous control of the video signal source VSS and the store M . For filling in a simple manner, without disturbance, the store locations M with the mean value of the video signal take per accurately determined region, the output of the signal source VSS is coupled via an analog to digital converter A D to counting inputs of a number of counters BC1 to BC7 which number is equal to the number of regions per row, the counters being operative sequentially and periodically. Each counter BC1 to BC7 is followed by a buffer register BR1 to BR7 for taking over the counting information in the line blanking period at the end of the last signal period in the row of regions, whereafter the counter BC is reset. The buffer register BR is followed by the store M with the separate store locations M , which are filled with the previous counting information during the next counting operation.
