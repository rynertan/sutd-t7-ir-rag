## Description
MARINE OLSERVATORY CRAFT This inentio n relates to a mari ne observatory craft. Hitherto marine observatory craft h ave been useful in relation to the observation ofUnderwater locations such ss coral reefs and also marine life especially of the type that abounds in sub tropical and tropical climates. Usually such locutions are relatively close to finland resorts and it was necessary to transport tourists from the mainland to the underwater location of interest whereafter it was essential for tourists to transfer to stall craft having glass bottoms in order to view the underwater location. The transport craft was normally a rnotorboat having an inboard or outboard engine. The use of small glass bottom boats was found to be generally satisfactory if the weather was fine, the tourists were reasonably young and agile, and the underwater locations were relatively close to the mainland. It therefore will be appreciated that not all of the above conditions for use 0 small glass bottom boats were present on a particular day and thus use of glass bottom boats was not appropriate. It further will be appreciated that the r.aj or it of less dcvel ope d ard therefore Lore interesting marine areas arc inaccessible to the majority of tourists who are not scuba divers capable of operating off larger conventional vessels in the inaccessible or remote underwater locations. United Kingdom Specification 2 046 673 to Rambridge e describes a partly submersible boat with a ballast tank or tanks in which water can be passed and viewing windows which lie partly or wholly below the surface of the water at least when the boat is partly submerged. The control cabin is located forwardly and on the same level as the passenger level and thus will always be at least partly submerged in the travelling mode.The water may be pumped into the ballast tanks or alternatively it may be scooped while the boat is in motion into the ballast tanks via an inclined pipe. While mention is nade in U.v. Specification 2 046 673 of the fact that more than one ballast tank nay be included in each hull there is no specific description of same in the drawings. Also there is no specific description of how te water may be pumped into or out of the ballast tanks. U.K. Specification 2 046 673 only discloses a displacement hull which must at all times be located below the waterline when in a travelling mode. This means that the invention of U.K. Specification 2 046 673 is only applicable to still boats and thus is not suitable for medium to large charter vessels because the boat of U. K. Specification 2 046 673 may only travel in a ballasted state due to water always being present in the ballast tank s .It is also believed that the Rambri dge boat in having a control cabin on the same level as the passengers included in the or each hull will provide problems in relation to steering and handling as the driver or operator will not be in an elevated position to thereby provide effective handling control when either in the subnerged mode or the travelling mode. The Rambridge boat also requires the use of stabilizing floats for effective flotation and thus this provides a boat which is ver unconventional in appearance and it is believed speculative in nature especially hen no structural compoments such as bulkheads and the like are disclosed. It is also noted in re,ard to the Raibri dge boat that the ballast tanks are located on the botto, l portion of each hull or alternatively in a briding portion interposed between each hull and effectively the ballast cannot be carried in Ã¢ position approximately centrally or middle of the height of the boat and it is therefore believed that will adversely affect submerging operations because the ballast tanks are therefore of limited storage capacity. A further problem with the Ram bridge boat is that each of the passenger viewing areas are fully enclosed and thus this will be deleterious to passenger comfort because of the fact that some passengers may experience a claustrophobic feeling when the boat is in a submerged condition. The object of the present invention is to provide a marine observatory craft which alleviates the a boven entio ned disadvantages associated with the prior art. The marine observatory craft of the invention includes. one or more planing type hulls viewing ncan s associated With the or each hull one or more transverse bulI heads dividing the or each hull into a plurality of separate internal compartments which are sealed from each other one or more ballast tanks included in each internal compartment which function as seat supports wherein each internal compartment includes a viewing area having one or more of said seat supports, a control superstructure located above said plurality of internal compartments, means for selectively flooding said ballast tanks whereby the craft may move in i a travelling mode wherein the viewing means is located above the waterline and ii an observing mode in which the viewing means is located below the waterline said flooding. means including pump means valve means controllinu flow of water thrcugh the pp means inlet and outlet a feed conduit having separate communication conduits with each ballast tanl and venting neans associated with the or each ballast tank. Suitably the craft is multi hulled and thus relay be in the form of a trimaren or catamaran. However, this does not preclude the fact that the craft may be mono hulled if desired. Preferably the craft is a catamaran having a pair of hulls separated by a body portion incorporating the control superstructure and the viewing means is located on each side of each hull. The craft may be powered by an inboard or outboard engine or engines. Preferably there is a row of seats provided on each side of each hull. The viewing means may comprise an elongate window located in each side of both hulls but more suitably the viewing neans conprises a row of spaced viewing ports in an associated wall of the or each hull. The viewing means preferably slopes outwardly and upwardly so as to facilitate viewing of underwater 1 oca tions directly beneath the craft. Each ballast tanks may extend above the traterline lahen the craft is in the travelling mode and may communicate with a base reservoir located in each copartmenv and which may be flooded before water uay entcr the ballast tanks The punp means may be of any suitable type. The inlet and outlet may be separate but more preferably there is provided a conduit that functions both as an inlet and an outlet. h preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in wbich Figure 1 is a sectional view of a marine observatory craft constructed in accordance with the present invention and taken along the line b b of Figure 2 Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along the line a a of Figure 1 Figure 3 corresponds to Figure 1 on a smaller scale and showing the graft in an unflooded state and in the travelling mode Figure 4 corresponds to Figure 3 but shows the ballast tanks in a partially flooded state and thus between the travelling ode and an observing mode Figure 5 also corresponds to Figure 3 but shows the ballast tanks in almost fully flooded state and in an observing mode Figures 3 A to SA are section.l vieils taken along the line c c of Figures 3 to 5 Figure 6 is a sectional view of the craft taken along the line C C of Figure 7 and showing the ballast tanks fully flooded Figure 7 is a half plan view of the craft taken along the line d d of Figure 6 Figure 8 is a sectional view of the craft taken along the line g O of Figure 9 and showing the flooding means for the ballast tanks Figure 9 is a half plan view of the craft taken along the line f f of Figure 8, Figure 10 is an enlarged fragmentary view of part of Figure 9 illustrating the method of operation of flooding and Figure 11 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view along the line h h of Figure 6. In the drawings the marine craft 10 includes a control superstructure 11 and hulls 12. Each hull 12 on each side thereof is provided with a row of seats 13 and a row of viewing ports 14. Each port 14 as shown inFigure 2 extends outwardly and upwardly and is 1 oc a ted immediately a dj a cent to n associated seat 13. There is also provided bulkheads 15, 16, 17 and 18 as shcwn. Bulkhead 15 is a collision bulkhead and there is shown a door 19 cori niunicating between the interior of each hull 12 and the interior of the front or bow of the craft 10. The cockpit includes windscreen 20. As best shown in Figures 10 there is a pump 21 which may be of any suitable type such as a centrifugal pump or gear pump and a network of conduits comprising an inlet outlet conduit 22, solenoid valves 23 and 24, conduits 25A, 25B, 26A and 26B and a feed conduit 27 to ballast tanks 28 which form the interior of the hollow seats 13. There is also shown pump conduits 27A and 27B. Each solenoid valve 23 and 24 operate in unison and are actuated electronically from a control station not shown in the cabin 11.InFigure 10 the flow of water for flooding is shown by curved arrows in full outline wherein the water flows sequentially through conduits 25A, 27A, 27B and 26B to the conduit 27 and for defloodine or draining, of w ter the flow of water is shown by curved arro s in dotted outline trvelling through ccnciuits 27, 253, 27A, 27B and 26 to the conduit 22. There are also shown in the drawings base reservoir or bilge tanks 29 into which water enters when the solenoid valves 23 and 24 are actuated to cause operation of the pump 21 to draw water into the reservoir tanks 2S through the inlet outlet conduit 22. In fact the inlet outlet conduit 22 is open to the sea and is kept permanently full of water so that the pump 2t is self priming. There are also shown breather pipes 30 which are included in the ballast tanks 28 which communicate with the reservoir tanks 29.The breather pipes are useful in that they allow for venting of air from each ballast tank 28. The feed conduit 27 may deliver water as shown in Figures 8 9 through reservoir conduits 31 to the reservoir tanks 29 and subsequently to the ballast tanks 28.There is also shown spring loaded or pressure relief valves 32 which are associated with each breather pipe 30. The valves 32 are regulated initially in trials before being located or set in position. There is also shown a s spring loaded pressure relief valve 33 for the tanks 28 and 29 which may be actuated when the pressure in the tanks exceeds a predetermined safety level. The bulkheads 15, 16, 17 and 18 together with a partition 34 divide the craft into supper compartments 34 A and lower compartments 34B which are fully sealed from each other in the event of the hulls being penetrated or holed. There is also shown 2 housing 36 for the pump 21 and struts 36 interconnecting the hulls 12. In operation of the flooding of the ballast tanks the solenoid valves 23 and 24 are actuated which actuate the pulp 21 to draw water from the conduit 22 into the feeder conduit 27 as previously described and hence through the conduits 31 to the reservoir tanks 29 and hence into the ballast tanks 28. By operation of the solenoid valves 23 and 24 it will be appreciated that the ballast tanks may only be partially flooded if required as shown in Figures 4 and z. InFigures 3 and 3A the craft 10 is in the travelling node indicated by the waterline 8 lshen the reservoir tanks 29 and ballast tanks 28 are unflooded.From Figure 1 and 4A toFigures 5 and SA tanks 28 are pro ,ressivJely flooded and thus the craft 10 has effectively undergone a do nwa rc displacement until achieving the almost fully flooded position shown in Figures 5 and SA when the craft 10 is in an observing mode indicated by the waterline 9 where the location of the ports under the waterline facilitates the viewing of undersea locations by passengers sitting on the seats 13. One of the features of the invention as described above is the building in of the ballast tanks 28 as a normal part of the seating accommodation in the underwater viewing area, and in such a manner as to provide effective flood bulkheading of each individual viewing area 34A so that in the event of holing the craft on a reef or the impacting of a viewing port against a reef only that individual area 34 4 will flood without any further danger to the craft 10. The provision of ports having a sloping orientation as shown relative to the sea surface is useful in that it enables the viewer to obtain a sight of underwater areas directly under the vessel without the need to provide viewing ports on the hull base which would otherwise present an undesir, ble safety hazard in vessels use in reef areas. FiGure 11 shows ports 35 located in the partition 34 allowing fl ow of water front the reservoir tanks 29 to the ballast tanks 28 in each compartment 34E. Also shown is a floor portion 37 of partition 34. Furthermore the hull sh ape is contoured both to provide marine stability and to prevent halation or clouding effect due otherwise to direct sunlight effects upon the glass water interface which would prevent clear viewing. The craft 10 may include a system of freely rotatable underwater spotlights for night viewing or by the ships crew fro a master panel. In order to allow activities such as underwater feeding of fish by scuba divers or to provide easy access for tourist scuba divers to the water a hydraulically operated self contained fold away ladder systerl may be integrated into the bow interior ir required. The craft 10 is suitably designed with planing hulls utilising eniil es of the correct horsepower to provide a cruising speed of at least t5 knots. While a cata aran type hull is described in the preferrcd eirbodirlent because it offers maximum viewing areas, an ability to plane in reasonably heavy seas, a good upper tourist servicing and accommodation area, and the ability to be easily bulkheaded to conform to Lloyds codes for charter vessels, along with excellent safety factors in the event of accidental impact with reef areas, it should be under stood that the semi submarine principle for bulk transportation and combined underwater viewing facilities could be applied to hydrofoils, mono hulls, trimaran hulls or similar embodiments designed in such a manner as to take advantage of the specific technical features and advantages to charter operators and passengers. while it is intended to cover the building of the craft 10 in marine grade alu ini um it should be under stood that it is not intended that the preferred or optional embodiments shall be lin ited to this material but could be produced in fibreglass, steel, other metals, ferro cement, ferralite, plastic or any known and accetable form of seagoing vessel construction. Figure 11 also shows roof 33 enclosing the control superstructure to florin Ã¤ ebin 39 located above upper compartments 3rtfi of each hull 12. Cabin 39 has seats 40 as shown and passengers sitting on seats 40 may 1 ooh into conpartraent 34A through an opening. As shown in Figure 8 the tops of the breather pipes 30 stop just short of the tops of ballast tanks 28 to allow displaced air to flow downwardly into the reservoir or bilge tanks 29. Thus the valves 33 in the transoms of the craft 10 will be operable upon attainnlent of a pressure in excess of the recommended safety level. Figure 10 also shows conduits 42, 43, 46 and 47 which provide for lateral jets of water to be exited from the craft 10 when in a submerged mode for lateral or sideways movement when required. The forward conduit 42 exits through an outlet port 49 and the rear conduit 43 er its through an outlet port 8 shown in Figure 1. Thus the conduits 46 and 47 provide for jets of water to exit outwardly of each hull 12 and the conduits 42 and 43 provide for jets of water to exit inwardly from each hull 12.The conduits 42 and 43 are optional and may be dispensed with if required. I70vel.ent of water through the conduits ll2, 43, 46 and 47 ray be controlled by valves 44 and 45 when water flow s through the conduits 27A and 27B as shown. The present invention b being limited to planing type hulls thus provides a vessel of medium. to large size for use as a charter vessel and thus in the cruising mode may travel in an unballasted condition which is contrary to the prior art described previously. This also provides an extremely fast craft which is quickly semi submerged as described previously when required. Also by providing a cockpit or control cabin superstruture 11 above the hulls 12 this enables passengers in compartments 34A to sit in a fully open situation without obtaining any closed in or claustrophobic feeling as would be the case with a fully enclosed compartment or capsule. This also provides a craft which may be readily handled or controlled when required and provides a hiÃh observation point for passengers when required. The term planing type hull a used herein means hulls which may rise above their normal stationary waterline under the C influence of power. Thus in this manner the wetted surface of the or each hull is reduced in a travelling mode. Another advantage of the craft of the invention is that provision is made for lateral movement when required especially when in an observing ode. It should also be noted that flooding or ball as ting operations may be controlled automatically if desired by levelling sensors of any suitable type such as electronic, mechanical, electrical, hydraulic or gyroscopic sensors. The senors may actuate operation of th e valves as previously discussed which may be gate valves but are more suitably rotary valves.
