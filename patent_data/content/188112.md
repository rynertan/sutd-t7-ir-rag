# Hydraulic control system and valve therefor.

## Abstract
A hydraulic control system is provided, including a first bi directional fluid actuated motor 26 and second bi directional fluid actuated motor 28 adapted to travel a predetermined amount in each direction. A directional control valve 34 is placed in fluid communication with a supply 22 of high pressure, hydraulic fluid and a reservoir 24 . The directional control valve 34 has a first operating position 36 for directing the supply 22 of fluid to the motors 26 28 in a first direction of flow and a second operating position 40 for directing the supply 22 of fluid to the motors 26 28 in a direction of flow opposite to the first direction of flow. A combination sequence and regeneration valve 54 is in continuous fluid communication with the supply and the second motor 28 for preventing the operation of the second motor 28 until the first motor 26 has reached its limit of travel and for regenerating fluid from one side of the second motor 28 to the other side thereof when the first motor 26 has reached its limit of travel and the control valve 34 is in its second operating position 40 . The directional control valve 34 and the combination sequence and regeneration valve 54 are contained within a common housing 50 having three motor passageways 60 62 74 . The first two motor passageways 60 62 cooper ate with the directional control valve 34 for providing bi directional flow to the motors 26 28 . The third motor passageway 74 is in fluid communication with the com bination sequence and regeneration valve 54 for preventing fluid communication between the third motor passageway 74 and the valve inlet passageway 56 when the pressure on the inlet passageway 56 is below a predetermined amount and for permitting fluid communication between the third motor passageway 74 and the inlet passageway 56 when the pressure in the inlet passageway exceeds that predetermined amount.
