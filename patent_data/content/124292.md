# Water based photopolymerisable compositions and their use.

Aqueous dispersions comprising water, a cationically cur able compound, and a photosensitive onium salt, and prefer ably other ingredients such as sensitizers, fillers, and plasticiz ers, are useful for making printing screens, lithographic plates, and printed circuit resists.
