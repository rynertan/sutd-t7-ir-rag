# SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD WITH MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION SUITABLE FOR USE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

## Abstract
A satellite communications system apparatus and method for authenticating data transmissions uses the posi tion of the transmitter, which position is determined by the satellite communications system. The transmitter position information is appended to the message which can be either clear text or encrypted , which is sent to the receiver at a second location by the satellite system. A receiver can then authenticate the received message by comparing the re ceived transmitter position with stored transmitter position information. The mobile transceiver syncing versions of the present invention allow the transceiver to be mobile, as opp osed to being stationary. In this mobile version, each suc ceeding message is encrypted using the previous position of the mobile transceiver. Examples of transceivers imple menting the apparatus and method of the present invention are shown, as are the specific vertical market applications of financial networks and automatic weather observation and reporting systems. In each version of the present invention, the determination of the location of the transmitter for each message that is received introduces an independently verifi able authentication parameter.
