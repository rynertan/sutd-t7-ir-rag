# A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FAR FIELD SIGNATURE OF A MARINE SEISMIC SOURCE FROM NEAR FIELD MEASUREMENTS

## Abstract
A method for obtaining far field signatures of marine source arrays 12 by the downward continuation of near field data recorded along a short signature streamer 14 of closely spaced hydrophones 28, 30, 32 , located beneath the array 12 . This method has several advantages over conventional far field signature measurement techniques. The technique can be used in water depths as shallow as 50 meters, it does not require any precise knowledge of the array 12 geometry or of the location of the recording sensors 28, 30, 32 , and it may be used on a shot by shot basis to obtain signatures for use in a shot by shot signature deconvolution.
