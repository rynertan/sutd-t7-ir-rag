# Double wedge termination device for coupled cavity travelling wave tubes.

## Abstract
A termination device 48 for absorbing RF energy waves in the termination chamber 34 of a travelling wave tube. The termination device is formed by modifying two wedge shaped termination devices of the prior art. Specific ally, two prior art single wedge termination devices are sliced in half to produce two wedges each one half the thickness of the single wedge device. The two halves are positioned with their newly formed surface, formed by the slicing, in opposed facing contact. The new double wedge 48 thus has the same thickness as the prior single wedge and is readily accommodated within the termination cham ber. The double wedge termination device greatly reduces small signal gain variations across the operating frequency band of the traveling wave tube.
