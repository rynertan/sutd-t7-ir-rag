# Amorphous or microcrystalline semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor structure suitable for making a non volatile memory comprises an electrically conducting sub strate, at least two layers of different conductivity type se lected from i, p and n type amorphous or microcrystalline semiconducting material and an additional defect layer of amorphous or microcrystalline semiconductor material lo cated between two of the said different layers. The defect layer reduced the voltage required to transform the structure to a memory device.
