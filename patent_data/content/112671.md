# Laminate for wearing apparel and methods for the manufacture of the laminate.

## Abstract
A laminate particularly useful in producing warm moisture resistant wearing apparel for industrial applications and sportswear, superior in flexibility and comfort when worn while still providing appropriate moisture protection, and with a combined textured and creped surface for varying the appearance and degree of flexibility and feel to garments comprised of the laminate is made by joining a fibrous web such as a needled felt to a foamed synthetic resin web, such as polyurethane foam, to give a pre laminate 18, and thereafter, through controlled tension, temperature and roll pressure, joining a film 16, such as a synthetic resin film, to the exposed foam surface throug a heated roll nip 75, followed by embossing. The degree of crepe and texture or embossing imparted to the laminate vary inversely to each other, as desired, to provide a variety of fabric surfaces with different appearance and appeal.
