# Rolling mill.

## Abstract
A rolling mill for rolling metal strip is described which has the rolled strip temperature compensated. The mill illustrated stands 12, 13 and 14, and strip 15 which is coiled on to the coiler 16. A shape sensor 17 indicates the shape of the strip by detecting widthwise variations in tension in the strip. A temperature sensor 18. Upstream of the shape sensor 17 detects widthwise temperature variations in the strip which affects operation of the shapemeter upstream of the temperature sensor 18 are coolant applicators 20, 23 for differentially cooling the strip across its width to reduce those temperature variations prior to arrival of the strip at the shape sensor.
