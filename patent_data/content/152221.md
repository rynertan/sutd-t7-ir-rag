# AN EARTH TERMINAL FOR SATELLITE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
An earth terminal for a geostationary satellite communi cation system incorporates an oval or elliptical shaped antenna 1 whose horizonal dimension d₁ is greater than its vertical dimension d₂. The relatively small dimension d₂ facilitates transportation of the antenna whilst giving a beam shape which is broader in a direction perpendicular to the geostationary orbit of the satellite than in a direction parallel thereto. This special beam shape accommodates small movements of the satellite perpendicular to the orbit whilst giving the necessary angular resolution in the direction of the orbit to avoid interference with other satellites in the geostationary orbit.
