# A METHOD TO INFLUENCE AN AUDIO SOURCE DURING TELEPHONE OPERATION, AND A DEVICE FOR UTILIZATION OF THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method to influence an audio source during telephone calls, and a device for utilization of the method, whereby the sound volume of the audio source is being reduced in connec tion with incoming telephone signals, as well as during the period of time that the receiver of a telephone B is being lifted. According to the invention, a signal status indicating unit A is connected to the wiring circuit of a telephone B , said unit being arranged to indicate both incoming telephone signals as well as lifted telephone receiver. The signal status indicating unit A is preferably arranged to maintain the out put signal also during the time interval existing between two successive telephone signals. Said output signal is transmit ted, wireless or by wire, to connect a shunting resister G in the loudspeaker circuit for which a reduced sound volume is intended, and by loudspeaker is also included the audio circuit existing in the audio source, in which the shunting resistor G can be included as an integrated member. When an output signal from the signal status indicating unit A no longer exists, the shunting resistor G is disconnected from the audio or loudspeaker circuit, thereby restoring the original sound volume.
