# Abrasion resistant, machinable white cast iron.

## Abstract
A cast iron alloy composition comprising 2.5 3.5 carbon, 0.5 1.0 manganese, 0.25 1.5 silicon, 13 19 chromium, and 0.8 3.0 nickel, the balance essentially being iron, this composition being machinable in the annealed condition and abrasion resistant in the hardened condition. The alloy assumes its annealed condition by heating to above the austenitizing temperature followed by furnace cooling at a rate between 100 C hr and 350 C hr it assumes the hardened condition when the heating is followed by aircooling.
