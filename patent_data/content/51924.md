## Abstract
There are provided a method and apparatus for trimming shaped articles from the connecting web of sheet plastics material from which the articles have been thermoformed so as to achieve accurate trimming regardless of irregular spacing of the articles in the sheet. In the method, each of a plurality of connected articles is first approximately, and then exactly registered with an article punch and the web trimmed off with a die.
