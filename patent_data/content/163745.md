# QUADRUPOLE PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

## Abstract
A quadrupole particle accelerator has quadrupole elec trodes 22 , 24 , 26 and 28 having corrugated surfaces which oppose each other, and an external resonant circuit. The external resonant circuit is constituted by capacitors which are formed by the opposing electrodes 22 , 26 , and 24 , 28 , a variable capacitor 36 provided in parallel to the capacitors, and a coil 34 . The resonant frequency may be varied. The quadrupole electrodes 22 , 24 , 26 and 28 may be supplied with a direct current and an alternating current which are superposed. The thus arranged ac celerator may be employed in an ion implantation appara tus. Thus, it becomes possible to implant a large current ion beam on the order of several hundred keV to several MeV.
