# Droplet depositing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for applying a fluid comprising a liquid solvent or carrier medium to a substrate using an ink jet printing device in which the fluid composition is ejected through a nozzle 2 as a jet of fluid, the jet is broken up into substantially uniformly sized droplets by the application of vibration to the composition, the droplets are passed by a charging means 7 by which they are given an electrical charge, the charged droplets are passed through an electric field 8 whereby they are deflected to a desired extent so as selectively to fall upon a substrate to form a symbol thereon or into a catching means 10 from which the composition is recycled for re use characterised in that the viscosity of the fluid composition is monitored and in that solvent or carrier liquid is added to the fluid to return the liquid content of the fluid to a desired value. The invention also relates to a continuous ink jet printer comprising a nozzle 2 , through which a fluid composition is adapted to be ejected, in fluid flow communication with a reservoir 1 for that fluid, means for applying vibration to the fluid composition whereby fluid ejected from the nozzle is formed into substantially uniformly sized droplets, charging means 8 whereby the droplets are given an electrical charge, deflection means 9 whereby the charged droplets are deflected to a desired extent so as selectively to fall upon a substrate to form a symbol thereon or into a catching means 10 whereby the droplets are caught for recycle to the reservoir 1 , characterised in that the apparatus incorporates a means 14, 15, 16, 17 for monitoring the viscosity of the fluid used in the apparatus to provide one or more measurements indicative of the viscosity of the fluid in the apparatus and means for incorporating one or more components of the fluid into the fluid in response to the said measurements.
