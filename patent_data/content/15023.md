# Character Generator Arrangement for Controlling the Display of Alpha Numeric Characters.

## Abstract
An alpha numeric character generator arrangement hav ing as a character store a read only memory in which characters are stored in a character format composed of a co ordinate matrix e.g. a 7 5 dot matrix of discrete charac ter elements. One aspect of the invention resides in storing the descender letters g, j, p, q and y such that those elements forming the tail of the descender letter are stored in charac ter element rows which in a given row addressing sequence for the store precede the character element rows in which the remaining elements for the descender letter are stored. Another aspect of the invention resides in addressing the character element rows of the character store in a partially cyclic manner such that descender letters are read out for display in a lowered , correctly aligned, position in a row of displayed characters.
