# Electric light display apparatus.

## Abstract
An electric light display apparatus comprises slender discharge tubes 2 arranged in parallel rows on the front side of the apparatus and each divided by openable light blocking members 3 into a multiplicity of sections 5 arranged continuously longitudinally of the tube 2 . The sections S are exposed or shielded by the blocking mem bers 3 individually to display the desired characters, illu strations or like images with a collection of bright portions and dark portions. The apparatus is simple in construction and less susceptible to malfunctions and displays images of high luminance which are distinctly perceivable visually without requiring a great power consumption.
