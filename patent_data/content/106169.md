## Abstract
Substituted 2 2,6 di t butyl 4 alkylphenoxy 4H 1,3,2 benzodioxaphosphorins that are readily prepared, for exam ple from hindered phenols and ortho methylolphenols, are effective heat and anti oxidant stabilizers for organic mate rials subject to degradation by heat and oxygen, and provide particularly efficient stabilizer systems when combined with hydroxyphenylalkyleneyl isocyanurates.
