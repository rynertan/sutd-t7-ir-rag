## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recording and or reproducing a PCM audio signal by using a rotary head. A standardization for the so called 8 mm video tape recorder has been set internationally. With such standardization, recording and or reproducing are carried out by a pair of rotary heads provided with an angular spacing of 180 Figure 1 shows a format of a recording track on a tape according to the above mentioned standardization. From the right hand side at which the head begins to contact with the tape, at the tip end of the track there is provided a tracing start area 51 of 5 Accordingly, in this standardization, the video signal of one field is recorded on and reproduced from the video signal area 56. At the same time, an audio signal of 1 60 second is pulse code modulated, processed for error correction or the like, then time base compressed to about 1 6.8, and is recorded on and reproduced from the PCM data area 53. This recording track is sequentially and obliquely formed along the longitudinal direction of the tape, by which the continuous video and audio signals are recorded and or reproduced. In an apparatus of the invention for recording and or reproducing a PCM audio signal by using a rotary head, an index signal is recorded on a part of a recording interval of the PCM audio signal by using the rotary head. It is thus possible to easily find a beginning of a recorded portion upon playback. A recording and or reproducing apparatus according to the invention is arranged such that a tracing period of a rotary head for recording and or reproducing is divided into a plurality of segments. A PCM audio signal is recorded and or reproduced in desired divided segments. An index signal is recorded at a predetermined portion of a recording and or reproducing interval of the PCM audio signal by using the rotary head as required. Upon playback, the index signal recorded at the predetermined portion is detected to thereby control the operation of the apparatus. In an apparatus of the invention for recording and reproducing at least one digitized audio signal on a magnetic tape having a slant track format a rotary head for scanning a slant track format magnetic tape includes transducer means for recording and reproducing signals on slant tracks on the magnetic tape, pilot tracking means are connected to said rotary head transducer means for producing a four frequency pilot signal, which is recorded by the rotary head, and audio signal processing means are connected to said transducer means for recording and reproducing at least one digitized audio signal on a part of a plurality of slant tracks. Further, in an apparatus of the invention index signal means are also connected to said transducer means for supplying an index signal to said transducer means to be recorded at a rear back area associated with and directly following the part of each of a predetermined number of said plurality of slant tracks identifying the beginning of a desired program of the digitized audio signal, said index signal means producing said index signal such that it has a predetermined frequency chosen for searching said beginning of said desired program and so as not to interfere with the four frequency pilot signal and it is recorded by said rotary head transducer means, and means for detecting said index signal reproduced by said rotary head transducer means are connected to said audio signal processing means so as to identify said beginning of the desired program of said digitized audio signal on the slant track during reproducing. Upon playback, the index signal recorded at the predetermined portion is detected to thereby control the operation of the apparatus. It is thus possible to easily find a beginning of a recorded portion upon playback. It is interesting to note in the above mentioned standardization, that when the video signal area 56 of 180 Figure 6 shows an example of a format of a recording track used therefor. In the figure, the portion from the tracing start area 51 in which the head begins to contact with the tape to the guard area 55 is the same as that of the above mentioned standardization and this interval is assigned as a first segment. Subsequently, from the beginning of the above mentioned video signal area 56, there are provided a next tracing start area 61, a clock run in area 62, a data area 63, a back margin area 64, and a guard area 65, each of which is formed the same as described above. This interval is assigned as a second segment. Furthermore, a portion the same as the second segment is repeatedly formed at every 36 Accordingly, there are provided 6 segments from the 1st to the 6th. Then, for each segment, the rotation angle position of the rotary head is detected and the PCM data is delivered and recorded at a time corresponding to each 36 As described above, the PCM audio signal can independently be recorded and or reproduced at the intervals that are provided by dividing the tape by 6 along the tape width direction. For example, by using a tape which is capable of 2 hour recording, it is possible to record the PCM audio signal for 12 hours, which is 6 times as long as the normal video recording. In the prior art 1 2 inch tape video tape recorder, when it is desired to detect a beginning of a desired recorded portion, or a so called program beginning search system is employed, and an index signal is formed by modifying a tracking control CTL signal recorded by a fixed head along the tape length. However, in the above standardization of the 8 mm video tape recorder, the tracking is carried out by using a pilot signal of a so called four frequency system which is recorded by the rotary heads so that the recording of the CTL signal becomes unnecessary, unlike the prior art. In the 8 mm VTR, it is possible to record such an index signal on a special track provided outside the start area 51 on the detaching area 57 by a special fixed head. However, from a designing and manufacturing cost standpoint, it is not preferable to employ the special fixed head only for such purpose. Furthermore, when the signals are divided into a plurality of multiple segments and then recorded, in order to record 6 index signals corresponding to the respective segments on one track, it becomes necessary to provide a complicated processing apparatus for coding the index signals and so on. Further, according to this method, it is very difficult to record, reproduce, and erase the index signal independently at every segment. The prior art apparatus is constructed as described above so that the index signal for use in finding the beginning of the tape, etc. is recorded only by a special head and the like. Particularly, when the tape is divided into multiple segments, the prior art apparatus requires a code processing circuit which is complicated in circuit arrangement and the index signal can not be recorded, reproduced, and erased independently at every segment. This invention provides a recording and or reproducing apparatus in which scanning periods of rotary heads 13 and 14 capable of recording and or reproducing are divided into a plurality of intervals, a PCM audio signal output from a processor circuit 8 is recorded and or reproduced in a desired divided interval, and an index signal output from a MODEM circuit 10 is recorded on a predetermined portion of the recording and or reproducing interval of the PCM audio signal as required. Thus, upon playback, the index signal recorded on the predetermined portion is detected to thereby control the operation. According to this apparatus, since the index signal is recorded and or reproduced by the rotary head, it becomes unnecessary to provide a special fixed head and so on. Particularly, when the tape is divided into multiple segments, the index signal is provided at every segment so that these index signals can independently be recorded, reproduced, and erased by a simple circuit arrangement, to thus find the beginning of a recording portion or a desired recorded portion, etc., satisfactorily. Referring now to Figure 2, reference numeral 3 represents the video signal processor circuit, 4 and 5 the change over switches, 8 the PCM audio signal processor circuit, 10 the MODEM circuit for index signals, 13 and 14 the rotary heads, 21 the RF switching pulse generator circuit, 24 the PCM audio area generator, and 25 the index area generator. In Figure 2, the video signal input terminal 1 and a video signal output terminal 2 are connected to the video signal processor circuit 3, and an output of a recording signal from the video processor circuit 3 is supplied to respective fixed terminals The rotary heads 13 and 14 are connected through playback amplifiers 15 and 16 to fixed terminals A drum motor 19 for driving the rotary heads 13 and 14 is provided with a pulse generator 20 which detects the rotary phase. This generator 20 is connected to the RF switching pulse generator circuit 21 which produces RF switching pulses corresponding to the video signal periods of the rotary heads 13 and 14. The output from the generator circuit 21 is supplied through a normal side fixed terminal The output signal from the switch 22 is supplied to the PCM audio area generator 24 and the index area generator 25. The output signal from the generator 24 and the output signal from the inverter 23 are supplied through an AND circuit 26 to the control terminal An output signal from an erase signal generator 29 is supplied through a switch 30 and an amplifier 31 to a flying erase head 32. The output signal from the switch 22 is supplied to an index signal erase area generator 33 and a PCM audio erase area signal generator 34. The output signals from these generators 33 and 34, and an output signal from an erase control signal generator 35, are supplied through an OR circuit 36 to the control portion of the switch 30. The output signal from the generator circuit 21 is supplied to a multi segment area delay circuit 37. The delay circuit 37 is connected to the system controller circuit 9, and the output signal from the delay circuit 37 is supplied to a multi segment side fixed terminal Referring to Figure 3, the timing chart thereof will now be described. When an RF switching pulse shown in Figure 3A is generated, the PCM audio area signal and the index area signal become as shown in Figures 3B and 3C. Accordingly, on the basis of these signals, from the switches 4 and 5 there are derived signals shown in Figures 3D and 3E. These signals are recorded by the heads 13 and 14. Upon playback, from the rotary heads 13 and 14 there are reproduced signals shown in Figures 3F and 3G. Hence, a video signal shown in Figure 3H is derived from the switch 17, and the PCM audio signal and the index signal are derived from the switch 18. When the index signal is written, the apparatus is placed in the recording mode only during an index area shown in Figure 3J and during this period, an index signal shown in Figure 3K is formed. Furthermore, preceding the index signal recording in the index area, an index erase area is formed at the position preceded by an attaching angle for example, 90 When the index signal is only to be erased without recording a new index signal, only the index erase signal is formed as shown at the right hand side of Figures 3L and 3M. As described above, the index signal area is formed at a predetermined position of the recording track and the index signal can be recorded, reproduced, written and erased in and from this area. A multi segment operation will now be described. In the above mentioned circuit, by delaying the RF switching pulse by 36 Also in that case, by using the above mentioned circuit, the index area can be provided at the position across the rear back margin and guard area of each segment and the run in area of the succeeding segment, in which the index signal can be provided independently. A practical example of an index signal will now be described. The frequency of the index signal is selected to be a frequency having a small azimuth loss that can be detected by both the heads 13 and 14 as a low frequency, and to be a frequency having a small interference with the other pilot signal the 8 mm video tape recorder uses a pilot signal with frequency ranging from 100 to 200 kHz for tracking purposes . By example, in the 8 mm video tape recorder, the frequency of the index signal is selected to be 386 kHz, that is 1 30 of the master clock. The index signal is recorded continuously for a period of several fields. When there is a crosstalk of the index signal from the adjacent track and there are crosstalks as shown in Figures 5A and 5C relative to an index output signal shown in Figure 5B, the envelope is disturbed due to zero beat as, for example shown in Figure 5D. Therefore, according to the above mentioned circuit, by recording the index signal only by the head 13 see Figures 3D and 3E , it is possible to prevent the crosstalk from occurring and thus to remove a fear that the mis operation due to the disorder of the envelope which may occur. Furthermore, for reproducing and detecting the index signal, the synchronous detection is suitably utilized. In that case, the frequency deviation caused upon the fast forward mode and the rewind mode can be corrected by changing a self running frequency of a PLL circuit of the synchronous detector. The index signal may be a signal with a constant frequency and may be an encoded signal after a certain modulation. According to the present invention, since the index signal is recorded and or reproduced by the rotary head, a special fixed head or the like is not required. Particularly when there is provided a multi segment, the index signal is provided in each segment so that these index signals can be recorded, reproduced, and erased independently by the simple circuit arrangement. Therefore, it becomes possible to find out the beginning of the recording portion, etc. satisfactorily.
