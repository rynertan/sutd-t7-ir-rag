# LATCH MECHANISM FOR VEHICLE SUN ROOFS

## Abstract
A vehicle sun roof comprises an outer frame 2 which is adapted to be fitted to the roof 3 of a vehicle, in an aperture of said roof designed to accommodate the frame, and a clo sure panel 1 connected to the frame 2 by a hinge connec tion 15 which is mounted on the closure panel 1 and which is releasably connected to the outer frame 2 . The sun roof further has a latch mechanism for holding the clo sure panel in a closed position on the frame and for main taining the closure panel in an opened position. The latch mechanism comprises a first mounting block 32 fitted to the closure panel 1 , a second mounting block 33 fitted to the frame 2 and a pivoting link assembly comprising a lever 34 pivotally connected at one end to the first mount ing block 32 and a link 35 pivotally connected at one end to the second mounting block 33 and pivotally connected at its other end to the lever 34 . The pivot axes of the lever and link connections are substantially perpendicular to the pivot axis of the hinge connection. The lever 34 is provided with an opening handle 42 and the connection between the lever 34 and the first mounting block 32 and or between the link 35 and the second mounting block 33 is de tachable.
