# Control system for monitoring and controlling the processing of glass sheets in a glass bending and tempering system.

## Abstract
A microprocessor based control system for monitoring and controlling the processing of pairs of sheets of glass 6, 6 in a glass bending and tempering system. The glass sheets 6, 6 are conveyed by a horizontal roller conveyor 24 which is driven by a drive motor 36 . The roller conveyor 24 conveys pairs of sheets of glass 6, 6 along the longitudinal length of an elongated heating chamber 18 to a bending station 22 where the glass sheets 6, 6 of each pair are simultaneously lifted by a bending apparatus 40 . The glass sheets 6, 6 are controllably moved within the heating chamber 18 while on a plurality of rolls 26 adjacent the bending apparatus 40 independent of glass sheet conveyance on the other rolls of the conveyor. The control system 10 includes a photoelectric sensor pair 62 mounted on the conveyor for sensing the glass sheets 6, 6 as the glass sheets 6, 6 are conveyed by the conveyor 24 . The photoelectric sensor pair 62 provides a glass sense signal to a control computer 88 . An incremental encoder 56 coupled to the output shaft of the drive motor 36 provides a signal representation of the angular displacement of the output shaft to the control computer 88 . The control computer 88 is programmed to respond to the glass sense signals and a transport signal of the encoder to provide control signals to coordinate the glass bending and temper ing system including the bending apparatus and a roll operator.
