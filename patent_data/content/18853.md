# Method of and system for the detection of object impact.

## Abstract
A system for discriminating between hard object impact detected by a transducer and background noise or electrical noise spikes. An impact signal 2 is compared in comparator OA‚ÇÅ against a level setpoint 3 which is not fixed but rather follows changes in the background noise level. The comparator output is applied to an impact signal discriminator which detects a predetermined number of consecutive cross over points AB, A B relative to the setpoint within a predetermined time period by means of 6 and also detects a predetermined number of such time periods with at least such predetermined number of consecutive cross over points by means of 34 , resulting in triggering an alarm signal from 38 . This technique efficiently discriminates electrical noise spikes from impact signals.
