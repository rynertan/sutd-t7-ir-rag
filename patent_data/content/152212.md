# Self reinforced face seal.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to a face seal having lateral portions bridged by segments homogeneously defined by the elastomer material of the seal. The circumferentially spaced bridge segments define voids between the lateral portions providing clearance to accommodate the seal material during swelling, and also permit the seal to be manufactured slightly oversize to compensate for shrink age without adversely affecting its sealing abilities and operation.
