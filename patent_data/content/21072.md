# Production of alpha hydroxy oximes.

## Abstract
An alpha halo aldehyde is reacted in aqueous media with an hydroxylamine generating reagent at a pH between about 2 and about 9 to form the corresponding alpha hydroxy oxime. The products are useful as stabilizers and as complexing agents and as intermediates to unsaturated oximes, unsaturated nitriles and carbamate type pesticides.
