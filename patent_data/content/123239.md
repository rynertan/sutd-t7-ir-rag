## Description
The present invention relates to combinations of naphthoquinones and pyridine derivatives. More specifically it is concerned with potentiating combinations of anti protozoal naphthoquinones and 4 pyridinol derivatives. Naphthoquinones of diverse structures have been described as possessing useful antiprotozoal activity, for example antimalarial, anticoccidial and antitheilerial activity. Some of these compounds have also been described as possessing activity against external parasites. Fieser An extension of this work is described in J. Med. Chem, 1967, Vol 10, No 4, 513 517 Fieser et al. . U.S. Patent No. 3 367 830 describes a series of 2 substituted 3 hydroxy 1, 4 naphthoquinones as anticoccidial agents. U.S. Patent No. 3 347 742 describes the use of 2 4 cyclohexylcyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinone as an anticoccidial agent. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1553424 describes the use of 2 cyclohexyl and 2 cyclohexylalkyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones as antitheilerial agents. European Patent Specification No. 0 002 228 describes a number of 2 cycloalkyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones as antitheilerial agents. European Patent Specification 77551 describes a series of 2 4 substituted cyclohexyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones as antimalarial and anticoccidial agents. European Patent Specification 77550 describes a series of 2 4 substituted cyclohexylmethyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones as antitheilerial agents. German Offenlegungsschrift 2,641,343 describes a series of 2 higher alkyl 3 hydroxy 1,4 naphthoquinones having acaricidal and aphicidal activity. A number of pyridinol derivatives have also been described in the literature as having antiprotozoal activity. Thus, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3 206 358 describes a series of 2,6 dialkyl 3,5 dihalo 4 hydroxypyridines having anticoccidial activity. The Bulletin of the World Health Organisation 1974, It has now been found that potentiation of antiprotozoal activity is achieved by combining an antiprotozoal naphthoquinone and a 4 pyridinol or an alkanoic ester thereof. The invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, a combination of an antiprotozoal naphthoquinone and a 4 pyridinol, or an alkanoic ester thereof, wherein the naphthoquinone and 4 pyridinol, or alkanoic ester thereof, are present in a potentiating ratio. The term potentiating ratio is used herein to indicate that the naphthoquinone and 4 pyridinol, or alkanoic esters thereof, are present in a ratio such that the antiprotozoal activity of the combination is greater than that of either the naphthoquinone or the 4 pyridinol, or alkanoic ester thereof, alone or of the merely additive activity of the combination based upon the activities of the individual components. The naphthoquinone may comprise any naphthoquinone known to possess anti protozoal activity having the formula wherein R¹ is a straight or branched chain C₁ ₁₄ alkyl group, a C₃ ₈ cycloalkyl or a C₃ ₈ cycloalkyl C₁ ₈ alkyl group, such groups being optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from C₁ ₆ alkyl or cycloalkyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxy, phenyl and hydroxy groups and R₂ is hydroxy, C₁ ₄ acyl, C₁ ₆ alkoxy, hydrogen, or halogen. Preferred compounds of formula 1 include those wherein the group R¹ comprises or contains a cyclohexyl moiety, particularly those wherein R¹ is a 4 substituted cyclohexyl group, especially a 4 Specific compounds of formula 1 include for example The pyridinols which may be employed in the combinations of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,206,358. Preferred pyridinols include those of formula II wherein each R³ is the same or different and is a C₁ ₄ alkyl group and each is the same or different and is halogen or a C₁ ₆ alkanoic acid esters thereof. Particularly preferred compounds of formula II include The naphthoquinones and 4 pyridinols and alkanoic esters thereof employed in the combinations according to the invention may be prepared in conventional manner, for example, using analogous techniques to those described in the above mentioned references. The two active ingredients of the combinations of the invention may be present in any convenient potentiating ratio. The actual ratio will vary depending primarily upon the inherent antiprotozoal activity of the naphthoquinone. Thus the more active the naphthoquinone the greater will be the ratio of pyridinol to naphthoquinone. However, in general, the ratio of naphthoquinone to pyridinol w w will be in the range of 1 500 to 1 1. The ratio of more active naphthoquinones to pyridinol is advantageously about 1 50 to 1 500 or even greater for less active naphthoquinones the ratio will be lower, for example in the ranges of about 1 10 to 1 100 or 1 1 to 1 25 depending upon the activity of the naphthoquinone. According to a further feature of the invention we provide a combination as described herein for use as a therapeutic agent, for example for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of a protozoal disease as described below. Examples of protozoal diseases which may be treated in accordance with the invention include coccidiosis and malarial infections, in hosts, including mammals such as man in the case of malaria and birds such as poultry in the case of coccidiosis . The amount of naphthoquinone required for therapeutic effect is at the ultimate discretion of the physician veterinarian carrying out the treatment and will, of course, vary not only with the nature of the infection to be treated but also with the particular naphthoquinone and pyridinol used and the ratio thereof. In general, however, a suitable daily dose for a mammal including man for the treatment of malaria, for example, will lie in the range of 0.1mg to 200mg kg bodyweight, for example 1mg to 100mg kg such as 10mg to 40mg kg. The amount of pyridinol present in the combination will be that necessary to provide the appropriate potentiating ratio of naphthoquinone to pyridinol as hereinbefore defined. Thus the amount of pyridinol will vary according to the particular naphthoquinone employed but will be apparent to someone skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the amount of the combinations, according to the invention, required for use in treatment or prophylaxis will vary not only with the active compound but also with the route of administration and nature of the infection. In general a suitable dose for a mammal including man for treatment, for example of malaria, will lie in the range of 0.1 mg to 200 mg per kilogram bodyweight per day, with a preferred range of 1 mg to 100 mg, particularly 10 to 40 mg. For the prophylaxis or treatment of coccidiosis the compound will normally be administered The combinations of the invention are preferably employed as antiprotozoal agents in the form of therapeutic pharmaceutical or veterinary formulations. According to a further feature of the present invention we provide a therapeutic formulation comprising a combination, according to the invention, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and or optionally one or more further therapeutic and or prophylactic ingredients. The combination according to the invention is present in the therapeutic formulations in an effective antiprotozoal amount. The combinations may conveniently be presented as therapeutic formulations in unit dosage form. A convenient unit dose formulation contains the combination in an amount of from 10 mg to 1 g. Therapeutic formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral including intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the oral route is preferred. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers of both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Therapeutic formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the combination. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding an inert liquid diluent. Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may be optionally scored. Capsules may be prepared by filling the combination, either alone or in admixture with one or more accessory ingredients, into the capsule cases and then sealing them in the usual manner. Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein the combination together with any accessory ingredient s is sealed in a rice paper envelope. Therapeutic formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a liquid may be presented as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid, or as an oil in water or water in oil liquid emulsion. Therapeutic formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the combination with the softened or melted carrier s followed by chilling and shaping moulds. Therapeutic formulations suitable for parenteral administration include sterile solutions or suspensions of the combination in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles. Such preparations are conveniently presented in unit dose or multi dose containers which are sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like, and substances included for the purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The therapeutic formulations for veterinary use, may conveniently be in either powder or liquid concentrate form. In accordance with standard veterinary formulation practice, conventional water soluble excipients, such as lactose or sucrose, may be incorporated in the powders to improve their physical properties. Thus particularly suitable powders of this invention comprise 50 to 100 w w, and preferably 60 to 80 w w of the combination and 0 to 50 w w and preferably 20 to 40 w w of conventional veterinary excipients. These powders may either be added to animal feedstuffs, for example by way of an intermediate premix, or diluted in animal drinking water. Liquid concentrates of this invention suitably contain a water soluble compound combination and may optionally include a veterinarily acceptable water miscible solvent, for example polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, glycerol formal or such a solvent mixed with up to 30 v v of ethanol. The liquid concentrates may be administered to the drinking water of animals, particularly poultry. The following examples illustrate the invention The effect of combinations of 2 4 For subsequent combination experiments the individual drug solutions and mixtures thereof were serially diluted. The percentage inhibition of incorporation of radio activity in the drug treated cultures for a range of concentrations and combinations thereof were determined and are shown in Table 1. The IC₅₀ of each drug at a fixed concentration of the other was determined by linear regression and is shown in Table II. Plotting of these values on an isobologram demonstrated that the anti malarial activity of the drugs in combination was greater than that of the predicted additive effect of the individual components.
