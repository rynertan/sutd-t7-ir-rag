## Description
CONTROL SYSTEM FOR HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT MEANSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to control systems for hydraulic circuit means connecting together S variable dlsplacemeft hydraulic pump and actuator means driven by the pump the operating speed of the actuator means being controlled by the position of a displacement volume varying member of the pump, and more particularly it is concerned with a control system for hydraulic circuit means capable of effecting control of acceleration of the actuator means by restricting the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member of the pump to a level below a predetermined maximum speed. There has been proposed that the above hydraulic circuit means connecting together a variable displacement pump and an actuator driven by the pump is used for civil engineering and architectural machines, such as a hydraulic shovel, hydraulic crane, etc., and for hydraulic excavators for mining coals, for example. In a hydraulic shovel, for example, working elements including a boom, a bucket, an arm, travelling members, swivelling member, etc., are driven by the actuator of the hydraulic circuit means which may be a hydraulic motor or a hydraulic cylinder. In this type of hydraulic circuit, the operating speed of the actuator is determined by the displacement volume of the pump.For example, if the displacement volume of the hydraulic pump is suddenly increased by rapidly actuating a displacement volume varying member or a swash plate of the pump connected to a boom cylinder at initial stages of boom operation, the forces moving the boom cylinder would be suddenly increased and give a shock thereto. When it is desired to decelerate the boom cylinder, a great shock also would be suffered if the displacement volume of the pump is suddenly reduced and the boom cylinder might become uncontrollable.Also, if such shock is given when the hydraulic machine is started, the operator would be jolted and the operating lever might become temporarily uncontrollable, thereby causing hunting to occur. To obviate the aforesaid problem, proposals have been made to control the displacement volume varying member or swash plate of the variable displacement hydraulic pump while restricting the oprating speed of the swash plate to a level below a predetermined maximum speed, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application LaidOpen No. 59006 81. As aforesaid, in the hydraulic circuit means, the operating speed of the actuator is determined by the displacement volume of the pump. The displacement volume is decided by the position of the displacement volume varying member. In a swash plate pump, the displacement volume varying member comprises a swash plate. Thus, in the hydraulic circuit means using a swash plate pump, the operating speed of the actuator may vary depending on the position of the swash plate, and acceleration of the actuator can be controlled by varying the operating speed of the swash plate. In the control system of the prior art described hereinabove, when an operating signal indicative of a value for commanding the position of the swash plate is produced, an increasing rate or a decreasing rate of the position command value is compared with a predetermined maximum speed set beforehand. The result of this is that the position command value is increased or decreased at the predetermined maximum speed when the changing rate of the position command value is higher than the predetermined maximum value and at the changing rate of the position command value itself when the changing rate of the position command value is lower than the predetermined maximum speed, and then supplied as an output to swash plate drive means while being compared with the output of a displacement meter for detecting a position of the swash plate.Thus, the swash plate of the variable displacement hydraulic pump is controlled in such a manner that its position is shifted to a position designated by the command value of the operating signal while its operating speed is restricted to a level below the predetermined maximum speed. By effecting control in this way, it is possible to perform small shock and smooth operation of each working elements if the maximum operating speed is set at a value suiting each working element driven by the actuator. This is referred to as actuator acceleration control or swash plate speed control. The predetermined maximum speed is set at a constant value for each operating member and should be set at a low level for a working element of high inertia, such as a boom and travelling members. Because of this, it is impossible to bring the working element of low predetermined maximum speed to a sudden halt when it is desired to stop it. Thus, for example, when a hydraulic machine is to be suddenly braked during travel, there is a great danger. Also, difficulties would be experienced in stopping the working element accurately in a desired position or suddenly reversing the direction of operation of the working element. Moreover, the predetermined maximum speed is usually set at a suitable constant value at which the movement of the actuator or working element does not slacken and much shock is not caused as the operating lever is suddenly shifted from a neutral position to the full. Thus, the predetermined maximum speed is a value which is too high when the manipulated variable of the operating lever is small or when it is desired to perform a fine operation in which the operating speed of the hydraulic actuator is so low that a shock, no matter how small, will pose a problem. Thus, if the operating lever is suddently actuated when such fine operation is performed, a shock will be suffered because the actuator is operated at the predetermined maximum speed. Also, in normal operation, an increase in pressure at actuator startup is influenced by the swash plate speed.Thus, if the aforesaid control process of the prior art is used, a peak pressure will be generated at actuator startup, thereby causing a shock.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention has been developed for the purpose of obviating the aforesaid disadvantages of the prior art. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a control system for hydraulic circuit means capable of making the actuator perform smooth operation which is free from slackness and shock in normal operation and capable of making the actuator act nimbly when it is desired to bring the actuator to a sudden halt in case of emergency, when it is desired to accurately position the load of the actuator, and when it is desired to suddenly reverse the direction of operation of the actuator. Another object is to provide a control system for hydraulic circuit means capable of making the actuator perform smooth operation which is free from slackness in normal operation in which the operating lever has a large manipulated variable and capable of making the actuator operate without suffering a shock at actuator startup and when a fine operation is performed. Still another object is to provide a control system for hydraulic circuit means capable of making the actuator operate quickly without causing any shock when it is desired to bring the actuator to a sudden halt in case of emergency, when it is desired to accurately position the load of the actuator, and when it is desired to suddenly reverse the direction of operation of the actuator and capable of readily effecting fine adjustments of the speed of the actuator when the latter is operating at high speed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In Fig. 1, the reference numeral 2 generally designates hydraulic circuit means including a variable displacement hydraulic pump 4, and a hydraulic motor or actuator 6 driven by the pump 4 connected together in a closed circuit. In this embodiment, the pump 4 is a swash plate pump having a swash plate 8 serving as a displacement volume varying member. The swash plate 8 has its angle or position varied by drive means 10.The pump 4 drives the actuator 6 with a displacement volume corresponding to the position of the swash plate 8. More specifically, the operating speed of the actuator 6 is determined by the position of the swash plate 8 and can be increased or decreased by varying the position of the swash plate 8. Acceleration and deceleration of the actuator 6 is determined by the operating speed of the swash plate 8. The swash plate drive means 10 may be in the form of any servo valve as desired capable of moving the swash plate 8 to a position corresponding to an input signal, or may have a construction shown inFig. 3 of the International Laid Open No. WO 81 01031. In the hydraulic circuit means shown in Fig. 1, accessory parts, such as flushing valves, are omitted in the interest of brevity. The hydraulic circuit means 2 is controlled by a control system 12 comprising one embodiment of the invention. The control system 12 comprises an operating lever 14 serving as operating means for indicating the position of the swash plate 8 and the direction of operation and the operating speed of the actuator 6, a displacement meter 16 for detecting the position of the swash plate 8, a predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 20 for inputting an output signal or operating signal XL of the operating lever 14 and an output signal or swash plate position signal YL of the displacement meter 16 to indicate a maximum value of the operating speed of the swash plate 8, and a pump control circuit 22 for inputting the operating signal XL, swash plate position signal YL and an output signal or predetermined maximum speed signal a and generating an output signal Z for actuating the drive means 10. The predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 20 comprises a first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 24 having a first predetermined maximum speed al set beforehand with respect to the operating speed of the swash plate 8, and a second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 26 having a second predetermined maximum speed a2 set beforehand with respect to the operating speed of the swash plate 8, the second predetermined maximum speed a2 being higher than the first predetermined maximum speed al. The first predetermined maximum speed al shows the value of an operating speed of the swash plate 8 capable of making the actuator 6 perform smooth operation free from slackness and shock in normal operation of the swash plate 8 when the manipulated variable of the operating lever 14 is not large.The second predetermined maximum speed a2 shows the value of an operating speed of the swash plate 8 capable of making the actuator 6 act nimbly when it is desired to bring it to a halt in case of emergency, when it is desired to accurately position the load of the actuator 6 and when it is desired to rapidly reverse the direction of operation of the actuator 6. The two predetermined maximum speed generating circuits 24 and 26 are connected to a switch 28 so that one of them can be selected Comparators 30 and 32 judge whether the operating signal XL from the operating lever 14 and the detector signal YL from the displacement meter 16 are positive or negative, respectively, and produce a high level signal 1 when the signals XL and YL are positive and a low level signal O when they are negative, respectively. The positive operating signal XL and detector signal YL mean the operation of the actuator 6 in one direction, and the negative signals XL and YL means the operation of the actuator 6 in the other direction.The comparators 30 and 32 may generate either If 1 or O when the input is zero.An exclusive OR or EXOR circuit 34 produces O when the two inputs are the same with each other and produces 1 when they are not the same with each other. A window comparator 36 produces 1 when the input is zero or in the vicinity of zero and produces O when the input has the other value. An OR circuit 38 brings the switch 28 into contact with a contact a by its output 110ff and into contact with a contact b by its output 1 .The range of inputs in the vicinity of zero which renders the output of the window comparator 36 1 is made to agree with the dead zone set in the pump control circuit 22. The dead zone is intended to avoid inadvertent movement of the variable displacement hydraulic pump 4 which might be caused by a slight movement of the operating lever 14 located in its neutral position. The construction of the pump control means 22 is shown in Fig. 2. The pump control means comprises an adder 40 deducting the swash plate position signal YL from the operating signal XL, and a differentiator 42 differentiating a deviation signal AX which is an output of the adder 40 and converting same into a changing rateAX of the signal AX with respect to time. The changing rate AX is inputted to a contact a of a switch 44. The means 22 also comprises a comparator 46 which judges whether the operating signal Xt is positive or negative. When XL 0, the comparator 46 provides a high level signal 1 to bring a switch 48 into contact with a contact b to allow a predetermined maximum speed inputted to the contact b to be supplied to a contact b of the switch 44 when XL 0, the comparator 46 provides a low level signal O to bring the switch 48 into contact a to allow a predetermined minimum speed a, which has been changed into a negative value by an inverter circuit 50, to be supplied to the contact b of the switch 44 from the contact a of the switch 48.The means 22 also comprises an absolute value circuit 52 for setting an absolute value X of of the output AX of the differen tiator 42, and a comparator 54 operative to judge which is greater X or a, and to provide an output ltO t when EX a to bring the switch 44 into contact with the contact b to supply a or to an amplifier 56 and to pro vide an output 1 when X at it a to bring the switch 44 into contact with the contact a to supply At to the amplifier 56. The signal Z amplified by the amplifier 56 is supplied to the swash plate drive means 10. Thus, the pump control circuit 22 is operative to compare the operating signal XL with the swash plate position signal YL and absolute value X of the changing rate of the operating signal XL with the predetermined maximum speed a and provides the signal Z as an output for moving the swash plate 8 to a position commensurate with the operating signal XL at the speed X when X a and provides the signal Z as an output for moving the swash plate 8 to the position commensurate with the operating signal XL at the speed a when X a. Accordingly, the swash plate 8 is moved to the position indicated by the operating signal XL while the operating speed is restricted to a level below the predetermined maximum speed a. Operation of the control system 12 of the aforesaid construction will now be described. If the operating lever 14 is moved to a positive side when the actuator 6 is inoperative, then the pump control circuit 22 supplies a signal Z to the drive means 10 to move the position of the swash plate 8 from a neutral position to one side toward the normal maximum position.At this time, the operating signal XL from the operating lever 14 and the detector signal YL from the displacement meter 16 both become positive, and therefore the outputs of the comparators 30 and 32 both become 1 and the output of the EXOR circuit becomes 34 becomes tOt. The operating signal XL is not in the vicinity of zero, so that the output of the window comparator 36 is rendered 0. r Thus, the output of the OR circuit 38 is rendered O , thereby bringing the switch 28 into contact with the contact a. Thus, the first predetermined maximum speed a ls selected and inputted to the circuit 22. In this way, the circuit 22 effects control to bring the operating speed of the swash plate 8 into agreement with the first predetermined maximum speed a1 when an abrupt manipulation of the operating lever 14 causes the increasing rate of the position command value of the operating signal XL to exceed the first predetermined maximum speed a1.Thus, acceleration of the actuator 6 is restricted to a level below a predetermined value corresponding to the first predetermined maximum speed a1 In the case that the operating signal XL of the operating lever 14 and the detector signal YL of the displacement meter 16 both become negative, the output of OR circuit 38 becomes O , thereby also selecting the first predetermined maximum value a1 Thus, circuit 22 effects control while restricting the operating speed of the swash plate 8 to a level below the first predetermined maximum speed 1 If the operating lever 14 is returned to the neutral position to suddenly bring the actuator 6 to a halt, then the output of window comparator 36 becomes 1 , so that the switch 28 is brought into contact with the contact b and the second predetermined maximum speed is is selected. As a result, the operating speed of the swash plate 8 is restricted to a level below the second predetermined maximum speed a2 and the limit placed on the acceleration of the actuator 6 becomes higher than when the first predetermined maximum speed a1 is selected.Thus, it is possible to bring the actuator to a sudden halt by greatly accelerating same. When it is desired to change the direction of operation of the actuator from one direction to the other direction, if the operating lever 14 is instantaneously switched from the positive side to the negative side, for example, a change in the position of the swash plate 8 takes place with a time lag behind the position command value given by the operating lever 14 because the operating speed thereof is restricted by circuit 22. Thus, the operating signal XL of the operating lever 14 becomes negative while the detector signal YL of the displacement meter 16 remains positive.This renders the outputs of comparators 30 and 32 and EXOR circuit 34 1 , 0 and 1 respectively, so that the switch 28 is brought into contact with the contact b and the second predetermined maximum speed a2 is selected. Thus, the limit placed on the operating speed of the swash plate 8 is increased and the actuator 6 is greatly decelerated. As the actual position of the swash plate 8 becomes negative, the output of comparator 30 becomes Q and the output of EXOR circuit 34 also becomes O , thereby selecting the first predetermined maximum speed a1. When it is desired to precisely position the load of the actuator 6, the second predetermined maximum speed a2 is selected by suddenly returning the operating lever 14 to a neutral position in the same manner as the actuator 6 is brought to a halt in case of emergency. Thus, the actuator 6 can be quickly stopped at a desired position by greatly decelerating same. Another embodiment of the control system in conformity with the invention will be described by referring to Fig. 3. The invention is applied, in this embodiment, to hydraulic circuit means 64 including a variable displacement hydraulic pump 60 and the actuator 6 connected together in an open circuit through a directional control valve 62. The variable displacement hydraulic pump 60 has a swash plate 66 which is of a single direction tilting type for delivering hydraulic fluid in one direction only.Switching of the actuator 6 from one direction of operation to another is effected by the directional control valve 62. In this circuit means, the operating speed and acceleration of the actuator 6 are also restricted by varying the position and operating speed of the swash plate 66 which is actuated by drive means 68 of substantially the same construction as the swash plate drive means 10 of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. The control system according to the invention is generally designated by the reference numeral 70 inFig. 3, in which parts similar to those shown in Fig. 1 are designated by like reference characters. The control system 70 comprises a predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 72 and a pump and valve control circuit 74. The pump and valve control circuit 74 which is of the construction later described inputs the output signals XL, YL and a of the operating lever 14, displacement meter 16 and predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 72 respectively and is operative to provide a swash plate control signal Z1 and a valve control signalZ2 to the drive means 68 and directional control valve 52, respectively. The valve control signal Z2 is lt or O , and the directional control valve 62 is moved to a position B when Z2 is If 1 and to a position A whenZ2 is 011.The valve control signal Z2 is supplied to the predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 72 in place of the swash plate position signal YL in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, and the signal Z2 is directly inputted to the EXOR circuit 34. Thus, the circuit 72 has no comparator 30 shown in Fig. 1. The pump and valve control circuit 74 is shown in Fig. 4 in which the circuit 74 comprises, like the circuit 22 of the first embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the adder 40,. differentiator 42, absolute value circuit 52 comparator 54, switch 44 and amplifier 56 and compares the absolute value X of the changing rate of the operating signal XL with the predetermined maximum speed a to select a value on the basis of At or a depending on which of the two is larger. The switch 44 is, however, brought into contact with a contact a when the output of comparator 54 is O and with a contact b when it is 1 . The control circuit 74 comprises a swash plate driving direction control circuit section 76 and a valve control circuit section 78. In the valve control circuit section 78, a comparator 80 provides a low level signal Ifoff when the swash plate position signal YL is zero or in the vicinity of zero and otherwise provides a high level signal 1 . A comparator 82 provides 1 when the operating signal XL is positive and provides O when it is zero or negative.A window comparator 84 provides O when the operating signal is zero or in the vicinity of zero and otherwise provides 1 . The output of comparator 80 is inverted by a NOT circuit 86 and inputted to a CK terminal of aD fli flop 88. The output of comparator 82 is inputted to a D terminal of the D flip flop 88. A NOR circuit 90 provides 1 only when the outputs of comparator 80 and window comparator 84 are both 0 .The output of NOR circuit 90 is inputted to an A1 terminal of a monostable multivibrator 92 which provides a O pulse for a predetermined period of time from a Q terminal when the inputs to A2 and B terminals are both 1 and the input to the A1 terminal changes from 1 to 0 . A switch 94 is brought into contact with a contact a when the output of comparator 82 is 0 , and the signal 1 is supplied to an S terminal of the D flip flop 88 and the output of monostable multivibrator is supplied to an R terminal of the D flip flop 88. The switch 94 is brought into contact with a contact b when the output of comparator 82 is 1 , and the signals supplied to the S and R terminals of the D flip flop 88 are reversed.The D flipflop 88 provides from a Q terminal the same signal If or or as the input to the D terminal when the S and R terminals both have inputs 1 and the input to the CK terminal rises from O to 1 , and provides the same signal 1 as the input to the R terminal when the input to the S terminal is 0 and the input to the R terminal is 1 and the same signal O as the input to the R terminal when the input to the S terminal is 1 and the input to the R terminal is O . An OR circuit 96 provides O only when the output of D flip flop 88 and the output of NOR circuit 90 supplied thereto via a delay circuit 98 are both RTI ID 22.14 O . The output of OR circuit 96 is supplied as the valve control signal Z2 through an amplifier 100. In the swash plate driving direction control circuit section 76, a comparator 102 provides 1 when the changing rate At of the deviation signal AX is zero or positive and provides O when it is negative. The out of comparator 102 is supplied, together with the output of OR circuit 96, to an EXOR circuit 104. A switch 106 is in contact with a contact a when the output ofEXOR circuit 104 is O and the predetermined maximum speed signal a is supplied to a contact a of a switch 108, and brought into contact with a contact b when the output of EXOR circuit 104 is 1 and the signal a is supplied to the contact a of switch 108 after rendering same negative by an inverting circuit 110.The switch 108 is positioned in engagement with the contact a when the output of delay circuit 98 is O , and brought into contact with a contact b through which the signal a is supplied when the output of delay circuit 98 is 1 . A switch 112 is positioned in engagement with a contact a when the output of OR circuit 96 is O and supplies the changing rate AX to a contact a of a switch 116 by inverting same by an inverting circuit 114, and brought into contact with a contact b when the output of OR circuit 96 is 1 and the changing rate EX is supplied to the contact a of the switch 116 as it is. The switch 116 is in contact with the contact a when the output of anAND circuit 118 is 11011, and brought into contact with a contact b through which the changing rate At is supplied after being inverted by an inverting circuit 120 when the output of AND circuit 118 is 1 . The AND circuit 118 is inptted thereto the output of comparator 82 which is inverted by a NOT circuit 122 and the output of delay circuit 98, and provides 1 only when the outputs of comparator 82 and delay circuit 98 are both 1 . Operation of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 will be described. In normal operation in which the direction of operation of the actuator 6 commanded by the operating lever 14 is the same as the actual direction of operation, the pump and valve control circuit 74 provides a signal Z2 of 1 or O due to the aforesaid construction, so that the two inputs XL and Z2 to theEXOR circuit 34 are both 1 or O and their outputs are O . The output of window comparator 36 is also O . Thus, the output of OR circuit 38 is O and the switch 28 is brought into contact with the contact a to select the first predetermined maximum speed a1. Thus, the operating speed of the swash plate 66 is restricted to a level below the first predetermined maximum speed a1 and acceleration of the actuator 6 is kept to a level below a predetermined value corresponding to the first predetermined maximum speed a1. When it is desired to bring the actuator 6 to a sudden halt in case of emergency or to precisely position the load of the actuator 6, the operating lever 14 is suddenly returned to its neutral position and the input to the window comparator 36 becomes near zero, so that its output becomes 1 and the second predetermined maximum speed is selected. The limit placed on the operating speed of the swash plate 66 is increased and enables the swash plate 66 to be restored to the neutral position at a high speed, thereby suddenly decelerating the actuator 6 and bringing same to a halt. If the operating lever 14 is suddenly moved from the positive side to the negative side, the output of the comparator 32 becomes O . Meanwhile, if the directional control valve 62 were actuated depending only on the positivity or negativity of the operating signal from the operating lever 14, a great shock would occur because of a sudden reversal of the flow of hydraulic fluid. To avoid this phenomenon, pump and valve control circuit 74 is adapted, due to the aforesaid construction, to actuate the directional control valve 62 when the swash plate 66 is actually restored to the neutral position.That is, the signal Z2 supplied from the control circuit 74 to the directional control valve 62 and EXOR circuit 34 remains 1 until the swash plate 66 returns to the neutral position, so that the second predetermined maximum speed a2 is selected and the swash plate 66 is restored to the neutral position at a high speed. As soon as the swash plate 66 returns to the neutral position, the output signal Z2 of the control circuit 74 becomes O to bring the directional control valve 62 to position A. The two inputs XL and Z2 to the EXOR circuit 34 become 0 , thereby selecting the first predetermined maximum speed a1 again. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the operating lever 14 has been described as being used as operating means. However, the invention is not limited to this specific form of operating means and master means may be used as operating means when an working element is made to act as a slave by following up the operation of the master means. The predetermined maximum speed setting circuit 20, 72 and control circuit 22, 74 are each in the form of an electronic circuit as described hereinabove and shown in the drawings. However, they may be in the form of a microcomputer or hydraulic equipment. Also, the circuit 20, 72 and the circuit 22, 74 may be combined into a single microcomputer. As described hereinabove, according to the invention, the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member of the variable displacement hydraulic pump is restricted to a level below the first predetermined maximum speed in normal operation in which the direction of operation of the actuator commanded by an operating signal agrees with the actual direction of operation thereof. Thus, it is possible to keep acceleration of the predetermined value thereby to cause the actuator to perform shockless smooth operation.Also, when the displacement volume varying members returned to the neutral position by an operating signal in case of emergency and positioning of the load of the actuator and when the direction of operation of the actuator is reversed from the actual direction of operation thereof, the second predetermined maximum speed higher than the first predetermined maximum speed is selected to allow the actuator to operate quickly. Thus, it is possible to conduct sudden stopping of operation of the actuator in case of emergency and accurate positioning of the load of the actuator and to effect quick reversing of the direction of operation of the actuator. A third embodiment of the control system in conformity with the invention will be described by referring to Fig. 5, in which parts similar to those shown in Fig. 1 are designated by like reference characters, and the control system is generally designated by the numeral 129. The control system 129 has a predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 134 in which a first predetermined maximum speed a1 as shown in Fig. 6, for example, is set beforehand as a function of the operating signal XL. More specifically, the circuit 134 provides a1 min as a predetermined maximum speed when the absolute value of the operating signal XL is below XL1 as indicated by XLl 1 4 XL max provides a which is obtained by. adding to al min a value increasing in proportion to the absolute value of the operating signal XL when the absolute value of the operating signal XL exceeds XLl, and provides a1 max when the absolute value of the operating signal XL is below a predetermined value nearXL max The value of a1 max is substantially equal to the value of a1 set for the circuit 24 of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. XL1 1 4 XL max is one example, and XL1 is not limited to this value. Operation of the control system 139 will be described. When the operating lever 14 is manipulated suddenly from the neutral position to the positive side to a maximum, the operating signal XL suddenly increases to XL max as shown in Fig. 7a. At this time, when the operating signal XL is in a range of low values, the maximum speed signal a1 min of a low value is provided as an output, and as the prating signal XL increases in value, a1 which becomes larger in proportion to the increase in XL is provided, and a1 max of a maximum value is provided when XL is maximized or near the maximum value. Thus, as shown in Fig. 7b, the tilting speed of the swash plate 8 is reduced and acceleration of the actuator 6 is also reduced at the initial stage of operation, so that the shock suffered at actuator startup can be minimized. The tilting speed of the swash plate 8 gradually increases thereafter, and acceleration of the actuator 6 also gradually increases. This avoids slackening of the operation of the actuator 6. When the operating lever 14 is suddenly moved from the neutral position to the positive side for 1 4 of the maximum manipulated variable XL max to effect fine operation, the operating signal XL quickly increases to XL1 but a1 min is provided as a maximum speed signal a1 as shown in Fig. 8a. Thus, the tilting speed of the swash plate 8 is low as shown in Fig. 8b and acceleration of the actuator 6 is small, so that no shock that would influence the fine operation is produced. A fourth embodiment of the control system in con formity with the invention will be described by referring to Fig. 9, in which parts similar to those shown in Fig. 1 and 5 are designated by like reference characters. The control system generally designated by the numeral 130 is similar to that of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 except that the predetermined maximum. speed generating circuit 134 used in the third embodiment shown in Fig. 5 is used in place of the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 24 in a maximum speed setting circuit 132. In operation of the embodiment shown in Fig.9, the predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 134 shown in Fig. 5 is selected in place of the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 24 in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, and the predetermined maximum speed a1 of the circuit 134 is provided as an output to the pump control circuit 22. In other respects, the control system 130 operates in the same manner as the control system of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. In the embodiment shown in. Fig. 9, circuits 22 and 132 are each in the form of an electronic circuit.However, they may be formed into a single microcomputer.Fig. 10 shows an example of computerization of the circuits in which an arithmetic control means generally designated by the numeral 140 corresponds to the circuits 22 and 132. The arithmetic control means 140 comprises a multiplexor 142 providing the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal YL by switching them, anA D converter 144 for converting the operating signalXL and swash plate position signal YL which are analog signals into digital signals, an ROM memory 146 storing the operation process, an ROM memory 148 storing a table of XL and a1 corresponding to the functions shown inFig. 6 and storing a2 corresponding to the value set in the circuit 26 shown in Fig. 9, an ROM memory 150 temporarily storing the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal YL supplied from the A D converter 144 and the numerical values in the process of calculation, a central processing unit or CPU 152 doing calculation in accordance with the operation process stored in ROM memory 146, and a D A converter 154 converting a digital signal from the CPU 152 into an analog signal and supplying same to the swash plate drive means 10. Fig. 11 is a flow chart of the operation process of the arithmetic control means 140 stored in ROM memory 146. Operation of the arithmetic control means 140 will be described in accordance with the flow chart of Fig. 11. As the operating lever 14 is moved from the neutral position to the positive side, the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal YL are both positive and the former is greater than the latter.Thus, steps a l, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 8, a 9, a 10, a 11 and a 14 are followed. More specifically, in step a 5, a1 corresponding to the operating signal XL is read from ROM memory 148 as a predetermined maximum speed a, and the swash plate drive means 10 is controlled so that tilting of the swash plate 8 will be carried out at a speed below the predetermined maximum speed a1 At this time, a1 may be of any value from at min to a1 max in accordance with an increase in XL. Thus, even if the operating lever 14 is suddenly moved from the neutral position to a maximum, a shock suffered at actuator startup is small and no slackening of actuator operation ensues. When the operating lever 14 is moved from the neutral position for 1 4 the maximum manipulated variable XL max to effect fine operation, the a1 read from in step a 5 is a1 min so that acceleration of the actuator 6 is reduced and a shock is minimized. When the position of the swash plate 8 has a value corresponding to the manipulated variable of the operating lever 14 or when the operating signalXL and swash plate position signal YL become equal to each other, steps a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, a 8, a 13 and a 14 are followed to control the swash plate drive means 10 in a manner to cause the swash plate 8 to become stationary in this position. If the operating lever 14 is returned to the neutral position or moved to the negative side, then the operating signal XL becomes zero or below zero and the operating signal XL becomes smaller than the swash plate signal YL, so that steps a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 7, a 8, a 9, all0, a li and a 14 are followed.More specifically, in step a 7, a2 is read from ROM memory 148 as a predetermined maximum speed signal a and the swash plate drive means 10 is controlled in such a manner that the swash plate 8 is tilted at a speed below the predetermined maximum speed a2. Thus, it is possible to obtain great deceleration of the actuator 6. In the embodiment shown and described hereinabove, the operating signal XL is related to the predetermined maximum speed a1 as shown in Fig. 6. However, the predetermined maximum speed a1 may be increased in proportion to the absolute value of the operating signal XL or in proportion to the square of the operating signal XL. Also, the predetermined maximum speed signal a1 may be increased stepwise as the absolute value of the operating signal XL increases. Stated differently, the predetermined maximum speed a 1 is set such that its value increases as the absolute value of the operating signal XL increases. From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that like the embodiments shown in Figs. 1 4, the embodiment shown in Figs. 9 11 is operative to restrict the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member of the variable displacement hydraulic pump to a level below the first predetermined maximum speed in normal operation in which the manipulated variable of the operating lever is great. Thus, it is possible to keep acceleration of the actuator to a level below a predetermined value and to enable the actuator to perform a shock free smooth operation.When the operation of the actuator is interrupted in case of emergency, when the load of the actuator is positioned and when the direction of operation of the actuator is reversed, the second predetermined maximum speed higher than the first predetermined maximum speed is selected for the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member, thereby making it possible to increase the speed of operation of the actuator. An additional advantage offered by the embodiment shown in Figs. 9 11 is that by virtue of the feature that the value of the first predetermined maximum speed is increased as the absolute value of the operating signal increases, it is possible to obtain a smooth operation of the actuator which is substantially free from shock when the actuator is started or when fine operation thereof is performed. Although in the fourth embodiment the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 26 is used, means for calculating a derivative value kL of the operating signal XL from the operating lever 14 may be used in place of the circuit 26, the derivative value XL being supplied to the contact b of the switch 28.With the construction, since the operating lever 14 is usually rapidly moved when it is desired to bring the actuator to a sudden halt in case of emergency, when it is desired to precisely position a load of the actuator, and when it is desired to suddenly reverse the direction of operation of the actuator, it is possible to obtain a command speed similar or higher than the above mentioned second predetermined maximum speed based on the derivative value XL, thereby making it possible to secure a rapid operation of the actuator. A fifth embodiment of the control system ifl conformity with the invention will be described by referring to Fig. 12, in which parts similar to those shown in Fig. 1 are designated by like reference characters. The control system for controlling the hydraulic circuit 2 is generally designated by the numeral 160 and comprises an operating lever 14 serving as operating means for indicating the position of the swash plate 8 and the direction of operation and operating speed of the actuator 6, a displacement meter 16 for detecting the position of the swash plate 8, a maximum speed setting circuit 162 for inputting the output signal or operating signal XL of the operating lever 14 and the output signal or swash plate position signal XL of the displacement meter 16 and to indicate a maximum value of the operating speed of the swash plate 8, and a pump control circuit 164 for inputting the operating signal XL, swash plate position signal YL and the output signal or maximum speed signal a of the circuit 162 and providing an output signal Z for actuating the drive means 10, as is the case with the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. The maximum speed setting circuit 162 comprises first, second and third predetermined maximum speed generating circuits 166, 168 and 170 respectively generating first, second and third predetermined maximum speed signals a1, a2 and a3 corresponding to the operating signal XL, a comparator 172 judging the swash plate position signal YL and providing a 1 signal when YL 0 and providing a signal µ 0 when YL O, a comparator 174 comparing the swash plate position signal YL with the operating signal XL and providing a 1 signal when XL YL and providing a 0 signal when XL YL, an EXOR circuit 176 providing a O signal when the outputs of the comparators 172 and 174 are equal to each other and providing a signal 1 when they are distinct from each other, a switch 178 brought into contact with a contact b when the output of EXOR circuit 176 is 1 and brought into contact with a contact a when it is O , and a switch 180 brought into contact with a contact b when the output of comparator 172 is 1 and brought into contact with a contact a when it is O . In the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166, the operating signal Xt is related to the first predetermined maximum speed a1 functionally as shown in Fig. 13. That is, when the operating signalXL is in a positive range, if XL is less than XL1 which is idicated as XL1 1 4 XLmax, then alpha 1 has a minimum value a11, if XL exceeds XL1, then a1 has a value which is a11 plus a value which increases in proportion to an increase in XL, and if XL has a predetermined value near the maximum manipulated variable XL max then a1 is maximized and becomes a12 When the operating signalXL is in a negative range, then a1 has a value inverted from a1 in the positive range. a11 is a value which causes no shock to occur when the actuator 6 is started to perform a fine operation, and a12 is a value which does not cause the actuator 6 to slacken when the operating lever 14 is manipulated to a maximum from the neutral position. In the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 168, the operating signal XL is related to the second predetermined maximum speed a2 functionally as shown in Fig. 14. That is, a2 is in a positive range at all times. If the operating signal XL is a negative maximum manipulated variable XL max or in the vicinity thereof, then a2 has a minimum value a21 and increases substantially linearly as XL increases from this value until a2 has an intermediate value a22 when the value of XL enters a predetermined range close to zero. IfXL becomes higher than a lower limit XLa of a dead zone in a pump control circuit subsequently to be described, then a2 has a maximum value a23. In the third predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170, the operating signal XL is related to the third predetermined maximum speed a3 functionally as shown in Fig. 15 which is in reverse to the functional relation between XL and a2 shown in Fig. 14. That is, 3 is in a negative range at all times. If the operating signal XL is a positive maximum manipulated variable XL max or in the vicinity thereof, then the absolute value of a3 has a minimum value a31 and increases substantially linearly as the value of XL decreases from this value until a3 has an intermediate value a32 when XL enters a predetermined range close to zero. If XL becomes less than an upper limit XLb of the dead zone of the pump control circuit subsequently to be described, then the absolute value of a3 has a maximum value a33. In the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 168, a21 is a value which causes no shock to be suffered by the actuator when the operating lever is slightly withdrawn to effect fine adjustments of speed or when the operating lever is greatly withdrawn at the initial stage of deceleration with the operating lever being in a negative maximum manipulated variable position or in the vicinity thereof.In the third predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170,. a31 has the same value as a21 when the operating lever is in a positive maximum manipulated variable p.osition or in the vici nity thereof. In the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 168, a23 is a value which is capable of obtaining quick deceleration of the actuator when operation of the actuator is interrupted in case of emergency, when positioning of the actuator is effected and when the direction of operation of the actuator is reversed with the operating lever being in a negative manipulated variable range. In the third predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170, a33 is the same value as alpha 23 when the operating lever is in a positive manipulated variable range.Thus, a23 and 1a331 have greater values than the maximum value 12 in the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166. As shown in Fig. 16, the pump control circuit 164 comprises an adder 180 for deducting the swash plate position signal YL from operating signal XL, a differentiator 182 for differentiating the output of the adder 180 or a deviation signal AX and converting same into a changing rate AX with respect to time, an absolute value circuit 184 for converting AX into its absolute value X , an absolute value circuit 186 for converting the predetermined maximum signal a to its absolute value at, a comparator 192 inputting both X and alpha and alpha and providing a signal TiOXI and bringing a switch 190 into contact with a contact b when X alpha and providing a signal 1 and bringing the switch 190 into contact with a contact a when X alpha , and an amplifier 194 amplifying the output signal of the switch 190 and providing it as a pump control signal Z. The contact a of the switch 190 receives AX, and the contact b thereof receives a. Thus, when X alpha , the switch 190 is brought into contact with the contact a and generates a signalZ based on AX when lEXIz lal , the switch 190 is brought into contact with the contact b and generates a signalZ based on a. The pump control circuit 164 has an dead zone which renders the pump control signal Z zero when the operating signal XL is between XLa and XLb in Figs.13 15 to avoid inadvertent movement the actuator when the operating lever 14 slightly moves near its neutral position. Operation of the control system 160 of the aforesaid construction will be described by referring to Fig. 17 which is a time chart. In Fig. 17, to indicate a point in time at which the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal are both zero. If the operating lever 14 is suddenly moved to XL max from this point in time to t1, then the comparator 172 provides 1 as an output because YL O in the predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 162 shown in Fig. 12. Since the position of the swash plate 8 shows a change with a time lag behind a change in the operating signal because of speed control of the pump control circuit 164, XL YL and comparator 174 provides If 1 as an output, so that the inputs to EXOR circuit 176 are both 1 and EXOR circuit 176 provides as an output.This brings switch 178 into contact with the contact a and selects the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166 having such function as shown in Fig. 13. Thus, the maximum speed setting circuit 162 provides the value of from a11 to a12 as predetermined maximum speeds between to and t1 and the pump control circuit 164 supplies a signalZ to the drive means 10 to move the swash plate 8 at a speed below the predetermined maximum speeds of from all to a12 to the position YL max corresponding to the operating signal XL max Accordingly, between to and t2, the swash plate 8 initially moves at a slow speed below a and moves substantially at a normal speed of a12 substantially after t1. This enables shockless smooth actuator startup and quick actuator operation to be obtained. If the operating lever 14 is suddenly returned to the neutral position from t3 to t4 in Fig. 17, then the output of comparator 172 shown in Fig. 12 remains lt because YL O. However, speed control of the swash plate 8 effected by the pump control circuit 164 makesXL smaller than YL and the output of comparator 174 becomes O . Thus, the inputs to EXOR circuit 176 become If1 TI and O and the output thereof becomes TI 1 thereby to bring switch 178 into contact with the contact b. At this time, the output of comparator 172 is 1 , so that switch 180 is brought into contact with the contact b. As a result, the third predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170 of the contents shown in Fig.15 is selected. Thus, between t3 and t5 in Fig. 17, circuit 162 provides the value of from a31 to a32 shown in Fig. 15 as the predetermined maximum speed before the operating signal enters the dead zone of from XLa to XLb and provides a33 as the predetermined maximum speed after the operating signal enters the dead zone, and the pump control circuit 164 returns the swash plate 8 to the neutral position at such predetermined maximum speed. Accordingly, in the initial stage of operation immediately after t3, the swash plate 8 is moved at a slow speed of from a31 to a32 to enable deceleration of the actuator to be effected with minimized shock.Substantially between t4 and t5, the swash plate 8 is moved at a high speed of a to enable the actuator to be brought to a quick halt in case of emergency or when positioning of the load is effected. When it is desired to effect find speed adjustments of the actuator by moving the operating lever a very small distance to the vicinity of XLo shown in Fig. 15 without returning same to the neutral position, for example, a31 is provided as a predetermined maximum speed. This moves the swash plat 8 at a slow speed of a31 to enable fine speed adjust ments of the actuator to be effected readily. Then, as shown at t6 t7 in Fig. 17, the operating lever is moved to a position XL1. At this time, as in the case of to t2, YL O and XL SO so that comparators 172 and 174 provide 1 and EXOR circuit 176 provides Q as outputs, so that the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166 is selected.At this time, in circuit 166, the predetermined maximum speed is a constant or all while XL is between 0 and XL1 as shown in Fig. 13, so that the pump control circuit 164 supplies to the drive means 10 a signal Z to move the swash plate 8 at a slow speed of a11 as indicated at t6 t8 in Fig. 17 to a position corresponding to XL1. Thus, even if the operating lever is inadvertently moved suddenly when fine operation of the actuator is effected in which the manipulated variable is small, actuator suffers no shock and the fine operation can be readily performed. Sudden movement of the operating lever fromXL max to XL max as indicated at t9 t12 in Fig. 17 will be discussed. From t9 to t10 and from t10 to t1l, Y, and XL YL, so that comparators 172 and 174 shown in Fig. 12 provide 1 and O respectively as outputs, and the third predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170 of the contents shown in Fig. 15 is selected as is the case with t3 t5 shown in Fig. 17.Thus, a31s a33 and a33 are provided from t9 to t10 and from t10 to t1l respectively as the predetermined maximum speed and supplied to the pump control circuit 164 thereby to control the swash plate 8 in the same manner as described by referring to t3 t5. As soon as t1l is passed and becomes YL 0, the output of comparator 172 becomes O . With the output of comparator 174 remaining O , the output of EXOR circuit 176 becomes O and switch 178 is brought into contact with the contact a. Thus, the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166 of the contents shown in Fig. 13 is selected.This causes the predetermined maximum speed to change from a13 to alpha 14 as shown in Fig. 13 as the operating signal changes from XL2 at a point in time of t1l to XL max at a point in time of t12 and thereafter the predetermined maximum speed becomes a14. Thus, the swash plate is controlled at a high speed as indicated at t11 t13 inFig. 17. This enables quick, shock free operation to be obtained when the direction of movement of the actuator is reversed. If the operating lever is moved from XL max to the neutral position as indicated at t14 tl5 in Fig. 17, YL O 0 and, because of swash plate speed control effected by pump control circuit 164, XL YL Therefore, the outputs of comparators 172 and 174 and the output of EXOR circuit 176 are 1 and fflfl respectively. Thus, switches 180 and 178 are brought into contact with the contacts a and b respectively, so that the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 168 of the contents shown in Fig. 14 is selected.Thus, during t14 t15, the predetermined maximum speed of from a21 to a23 shown in Fig. 13 is provided as an output to the pump control circuit 164, and a3 is provided as same. This moves the swash plate initially at a slow speed of below a23 as indicated at t14 t15 in Fig. 17 and then at a high speed of a23 to enable the same effects as described by referring to t 3 t5 to be achieved. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 12, the swash plate maximum speed setting, circuit 162 comprises three predetermined maximum speed generating circuits 166, 168 and 170. However, since the circuits 168 and 170 may use functions in inverted relation to each other, it is possible to enable circuits 166 and 168, for example, to obtain the same function as the embodiment shown in Fig. 12. Fig. 18 shows a swash plate maximum speed setting circuit 200 incorporating this modification. In the figure, parts similar to those shown in Fig. 12 are desig ted by like reference characters, and the circuit 170 is referred to as a second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit. The numerals 202 and 204 designate switches each brought into contact with a contact a when the output of comparator 172 is 0 and into contact with a contact b when it is 1 . The numerals 206 and 208 designate inverter amplifiers each providing an output by inverting an input signal from positive to negative and vice versa. In circuit 200, when YL 0 and XL YL andXL 0 and YL XL, the first predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 166 is selected as is the case with the circuit 162 shown in Fig. 12. When YL 0 and XLt YL, switches 202 and 204 are both brought into contact with the contact b to select the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170 as it is as is the case with the circuit 162 shown in Fig. 12. When YL 0 andXL YL, switches 202 and 204 are both brought into contact with the contact a. Thus, the operating signal XL inputted to the second predetermined maximum speed generating circuit 170 has its sign inverted by the inverter amplifier 206. For example, when XL XL max the input to the circuit 170 becomes XL max and the a33 shown in Fig. 15 is read out and has its sign inverted by the inverter amplifier 208, so that a has the same meaning as the a23 shown in Fig. 14.If, in the circuit 162 shown inFig. 12, the a2 and a3 of the second and third predetermined maximum speed generating circuits 168 and 170 res precisely corresponding to the XL and the XL that has had its sign inverted are equal to each other in absolute value, then the same operation as described by referring to the embodiment shown in Fig. 12 can be obtained with the circuit 200 shown in Fig. 18. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 12, circuits 162 and 164 are each in the form of an electronic circuit.However, these two circuits can be formed as a single microcomputer. Fig. 19 shows a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig. 11 n which an arithmetic control means corresponding to the circuits 162 and 164 is generally indicated by the numeral 210. The arithmetic control means 210 comprises a multiplexor 212 for switching between the swash plate position command signal or operating signal XL from the operating lever 14 and the swash plate position signal from the displacement meter 16, an A D converter 214 for converting the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal YL which are analog signals into digital signals, an ROM memory 216 storing the process of operation of the arithmetic control means 210, an ROM memory 218 storing three tables i , ii and iii of the XL and predetermined maximum speeds a1, a2 and a3 corresponding to the functions shown In Figs. 13 15, an RAM memory 220 for temporarily storing the XL and YL from the A D converter and the numerals in the process of calculation, a central processing unit or CPU 222 for doing calculation on a swash plate drive signal in accordance with the operation process of ROM memory 216, and a D A converter 224 for converting a signal from CPU 222 from a digital signal into an analog signal and supplying a control signal Z to the drive means 10. Fig. 20 is a flow chart of the process of operation of the arithmetic control means 210 stored in ROM memory 210. Operation of the arithmetic control means 210 will be described by referring to the flow chart shown in Fig. 20. In steps a 1 and a 2, the arithmetic control means 210 reads the operating signal XL and swash plate position signal YL through the multiplexor 212 and A D converter 214 shown in Fig. 19 and temporarily store same in RAM memory 220. In step a 3, it is judged whether or not YL 0. If YL 0, then the process proceeds to step a 4 if YL 0, the process proceeds to step a 5. In step a 4, it is judged whether or not XL YL. If XL YL, the process proceeds to step a 7 if XL the process proceeds to step a 6. Meanwhile, in step a 5, it is judged whether or not XL YL When XL YL, the process proceeds to step a 7 when XL YL, the process proceeds to step a 8. In step a 6, the predetermined maximum speed a3 corresponding to XL is read from theROM table iii of the same contents as shown in Fig. 15 stored in ROM 218 and rendered a. Likewise, in step a 7, a1 is read from the ROM table i of the same contents as shown in Fig. 13, and in step a 8, a2 is read from theROM table ii of the same contents as shown in Fig.14, 1 and a2 being rendered a. Stated differently, in the operation from to to t2 shown in Fig. 17, the steps a 3, a 4 and a 7 are followed, and the ROM table i of the same contents as shown in Fig. 13 is selected.In the operation from t3 to t5, the steps a 3, a 4 and a 6 are followed and the ROM table iii of the same contents as shown in Fig. 15 is selected, and in the operation from t14 to t16, the steps a 3, a 5 and a8 are followed and the ROM table ii of the same contents as shown in Fig. 14 is selected. The steps followed so far perform the same functions as the swash plate maximum speed setting circuit 162 shown in Fig. 12. In step a 9, the value of the operating signalXL near zero position is revised to a value of zero position which is used as a command value for the swash plate 8 serving as a fresh XL. In step a 10, it is judged whether or not Xt L If XL YL, then the process proceeds to step a 15 in which the signal Z for stopping swash plate 8 is supplied from D A converter 224 to drive means 10. Then the process proceeds to step a ll before returning to the start.If XL YL in step a 10, then the process proceeds to step a ll in which XL is obtained by a formula XL XL Y, YL t from XL, YL and the time t elapsing from the start of the program operation process to step a 16. The XL represents a swash plate speed at which the swash plate is moved when the signal of the operating lever is used as a command signal.In step a 12, it is judged whether or not XL tat. If It tat , then the process proceeds to step a 14 in which D A converter 224 provides a signal Z for moving the swash plate at a speed of kt. In step a 16, the process returns to the start. Meanwhile, in step a 12, the process proceeds to step a 13 when la XL alpha and provides a signal for moving the swash plate 8 at a speed a. By virtue of the aforesaid construction and operation, the arithmetic control means 210 is capable of performing the same function as the circuits 162 and 164 shown in Fig. 12. In the predetermined maximum speed generating circuits 166, 168 and 170, the relations between a1, a2 and a3 and XL have been described as having characteristics indicated by solid lines in Figs. 13 15. However, a a2 and a3 may be varied into curved as indicated by broken lines or may be changed stepwise. From the foregoing description, it will be appreciated that in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1220, the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member of the variable displacement hydraulic pump is controlled, as in the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 4, in such a manner that it is restricted to a value below the first predetermined maximum speed in normal operation in which the manipulated variable is great, so that it is possible to keep acceleration of the actuator to a level below a predetermined value. Thus, the actuator can be made to perform a smooth operation free from shock.When the actuator is brought to a halt in case of emergency, when the load of the actuator is positioned and when the direction of operation of the actuator is reversed, the operating speed of the displacement volume varying member is controlled in such a manner that the second or third predetermined maximum speed higher than the first predetermined maximum speed is selected to cause the actuator to operate more quickly. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 12 20, the following additional effect can be achieved as is the case with the embodiment shown in Figs. 9 11. The first predetermined maximum speed has its absolute value increased as the absolute value of the operating signal increases, so that the actuator can be made to perform a shock free, smooth operation even when the actuator is started and when fine operation is performed. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 12 20, the second and third predetermined maximum speeds have their absolute values increased as the operating signal becomes smaller or larger depending on the direction in which the operating signal undergoes a change. By virtue of this feature, no shock is produced when the operating lever located in the maximum position or in the vicinity thereof is slightly withdrawn, thereby enabling fine speed adjustments to be effected readily. Also, when the actuator is brought to a halt in case of emergency, when the load of the actuator is positioned and when the direct Ion of operation of the actuator is reversed, it is posible to make the actuator perform operation quIckly.
