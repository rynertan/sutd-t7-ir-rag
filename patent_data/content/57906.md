# Coating composition and process for preparing synthetic resin shaped articles by using same.

## Abstract
A shaped article of synthetic resins, such as poly diethylene glycol bisallylcarbonate, is coated with the follow ing coating composition and then irradiated with ultraviolet rays, whereby the coating composition deposited on the shaped article is cured to form a coating film having an excellent abrasion resistance, surface smoothness, adhesion to the substrate resin, flexibility, heat resistance, solvent resistance and durability. The coating composition compris ed of a a mixture of, based on the weight of the mixture, i 25 99.95 wt. of at least one polyfunctional monomer having at least three acryloyloxy or methacryloyloxy groups, ii 0 50 wt. of at least one mono or bi functional monomer having one or two polymerizable unsaturated groups and iii 0.05 25 wt. of at least one organic acid which has at least one halogen substituent fluorine, chlorine or bromine and which is liquid at normal temperature and pressure, and b 0.01 10 wt. parts, based on 100 wt. parts of said mixture, of a photosensitizer. The coating compositon may contain 0.05 25 wt. of at least one compound having an acrylamide or methacrylamide group and a hydroxyl group or groups.
