## Description
CONTACTLESS JET PRINTING METHOD, PRINTING INK COMPOSITION THEREFOR, AND ARTICLES INCLUDING CONTAINERS BEARING INDIC IA, PRINTED USING SAID COMPOSITION. The present invention relates to a contactlessJet printing method, an organic chemical mixture constituting an ink jet printing ink composition and articles including bottles, cans and insulated wire bearing indicia printed thereon using the said ink composition. The prior art appears to be best exemplified by the following patents Banczak 4,021,252 May 3, 1977 Wachtel 4,024,096 May 17, 1977 Parkinson 4,045,397 Aug. 30, 1977 Twang 4,070,322 Jan. 24, 1978 Parkinson Germany October 28, 1976 Contactless ink Jet printing techniques, wherein there is no contact between a forme and the article to be printed, although of comparatively recent development in the art of applying decorative and identifying indicia to a substrate, are of increasing importance. In general such techniques impose rigid requirements on the ink compositions. To be suitable for use in such a technique, ink compositions must meet rigid requirements of viscosity and resistivity, solubility, compatibility of components, and wettability of substrate.The ink compositions also must be quick drying and smear resistant yet they must not clog the ink jet nozzle and they must permit rapid clean up of the machine components with a minimum of effort. In addition to possessing properties demanded by the technique, such compositions must also perform satisfactorily in the particular end use application. To date, where end use requirements have necessitated abrasion resistance, resistance to weathering and fade resistance together with suitability for use on a variety of substrates such as polymeric surfaces, metal surfaces or glass surfaces, jet ink compositions have not been satisfactory since no ink offering such versatility has been available. Jet inks possess numerous advantages over inks applied by conventional techniques such as letter press, gravure, silkscreen or other similar conventional techniques. Such conventional inks are not suitable for jet ink printing because they frequently contain pigments which cause clogging problems in the ink jet equipment. Additionally, conventional inks generally require curing at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time.Moreover, their use in printing polymer coated surfaces, for instance, has not been particularly efficacious primarily because the means of applying such inks have not been conducive to high speed techniques. Desirably, ink compositions, suitable for use in ink bet printing techniques should exhibit excellent characteristics of fade resistance, abrasion resistance, and weathering, especially for use on containers or cans, and should be suitable for application to a variety of surfaces including polymer substrates, metal substrates and glass substrates. Advantageously such ink jet compositions will be suitable for application to polymer coated wires. The invention aims to provide such ink compositions as well as substrates bearing identifying indicia, derived by application of the jet ink compositions by means of an ink jet printing technique. Another more specific aim is to provide indiciacontaining polymer coated wires that are suitable for use in aircraft and that, when heated at temperatures of about 300 0F, are characterized by resistance to hydraulic fluids commonly employed. According to the present invention, there is provided a contactless method of printing indicia on a substrate, characterized by the steps of 1 providing an ink composition comprising a solution of a an epoxy phenolic binder resin b at least one soluble dye that is compatible with the other components of the composition and c a solvent blend consisting essentially of 25 to 90 of an alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols, 5 to 20 water, an aliphatic ketone having 3 to 8 carbon atoms which is present in an amount up to 40 , and 0 to 209 0 of a lower alkylene glycolether, 2 applying the said ink composition by means of a jet printing apparatus to a surface of a substrate selected from glass, ceramic, polymer coated wire and coated or uncoated aluminium or steel to form printed indicia thereon. This method is applicable to contactless printing of indicia on containers e.g. glass, bottles and metal cans for food or beverages . Accordingly, the invention provides a glass or metal. container having indicia printed thereon using an ink composition comprising a solution of a an epoxy phenolic binder resin, b at least one soluble dye that is compatible with the other components of the composition, and c a solvent blend characterized in consisting essentially of 25 to 90 of an alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols, 5 to 20 of water, 0 to 20, of a lower alkylene glycol ether, and an aliphatic ketone having 3 to .8 carbon atoms which is present in an amount up to 40 . This method is applicable too to contactless printing of indicia on polymer coated, insulated wire.Accordingly, the invention also provides a polymer coated wire having indicia printed thereon using an ink composition comprising a solution of a an epoxy phenolic binder resin, b at least one soluble dye that is compatible with the other components of the composition, and c a solvent blend characterized in consisting essentially of 25 to 90 of an alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols, 5 to 20 of water, 0 to 20S of a lower alkylene glycol ether, and an aliphatic ketone having 3 to 8 carbon atoms which is present in an amount up to 40 . The invention further provides an ink composition suitable for use in contactless jet printing of polymeric, glass or metal surfaces comprising a. solution of a an epoxy phenolic binder resin b at least one soluble dye that is compatible with the other components of the composition and c a solvent blend which is characterized by consisting essentially of from 25 to 90 of an alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols, 5 to 20 of water, 0 to 20 of a lower alkylene glycol ether and an aliphatic ketone having 3 to 8 carbon atoms which is present in an amount up to 40 . The invention will now be explained in more detail in the following description which is given by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Jet ink compositions embodying the invention comprise at least one colourant, a binder resin and a solvent blend consisting of 25 to 4096 of a lower aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a mixture of such alcohols, not more than 40 of an organic compound selected from the aliphatic ketones having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, not more than 20 of a lower alkylene glycol ether and 5 to 15 or 5 to 20 water. Other ingredients may be included optionally for special purposes.Such compositions are characterized by excellent fade resistance, abrasion resistance and resistance to weathering, and are especially suitable for forming identifying indicia on a variety of substrates including glass, ceramics, polymeric resins, polymer coated wire and coated and uncoated aluminium and steel e.g. from which food or beverage cans are fabricated. The components of the jet ink compositions must be in carefully balanced proportion to achieve 1 successful operation of the ink in a contactless jet printing apparatus and 2 suitable properties for coating the particular substrate. In general, suitability of the inks herein for the desired end use is measured in accordance with the following standards 1 Inks must dry instantly or be smear resistant upon application and dry completely in about 15 seconds without a post cure. 2 Indicia printed on polymer coated wire must be abrasion resistant to the extent that it remains legible at a minimum distance of 15 inches in minimum daylight 30 foot candles after 20 rubs with an abrasive felt employing 2 lb. pressure at a speed of 30 to 60 rubs per minute. 3 The printing must not damage polymer coating wire insulation. When immersed in a water solution containing 5 NaCl and a potential of 2000 volts rms. is applied for one minute between the conductor wire and an electrode in the solution, there must be no dielectric breakdown of the wire insulation, and the indicia must remain legible thereafter. 4 An optional requirement, when such composi tions are to be employed in certain specific aircraft is that the characters printed on polymer coated wire must withstand a 24 hour minimum soak in Skydrol, which is a hydraulic fluid containing active tributyl phosphate , available commercially from Monsanto as SkydrolLD at a temperature of 700C and, after air drying at room temperature for 24 hours, the characters must remain legible thereafter. 5 Characters printed on polymer coated wire must remain legible after a 24 hour minimum exposure, in a weatherometer, to alternating cycles of ultraviolet light and tap water spray. The cycle periods are about 102 minutes exposure to ultraviolet light followed by about 18 minutes exposure to both ultraviolet light and tap water spray. 6 Indicia printed on glass must exhibit ready adhesion to the glass, be abrasion and fade resistant and have the capability of withstanding the conditions of moisture and elevated temperature normally encountered in pasteurization when the glass is designed for such use as beer bottles. 7 Indicia printed on metal must exhibit ready adhesion to metal or synthetic polymeric coatings on such metal they must also exhibit resistance to fading and capability of maintaining adhesion under typical brewery pasteurization conditions when immersed in solution for 15 minutes at 150 F. The above characteristic a are indeed stringent requirements for an ink composition which also has to possess suitable viscosity, electrical resistivity and surface tension properties, to render it operable in ink jet printing apparatus. The ink compositions according to this invention meet these requirements. COMPONENTS OF THE COMPOSITION The Colourant. The characteristics exhibited by the colourant are of prime consideration to achieve the stringent resistance properties discussed hereinabove. In general, suitable colourants are dyes characterized by sufficient solubility in the solvent mixture to give the desired colour intensity and compatibility with the other components of the composition. Neozapon. Black RE available commercially from BASF is a particularly effective colourant for conveying light fastness fade resistance to the ink while Hecto Black R also available from BASF is most effective to convey Skydrol resistance for use in printing polymer coated wire.Mixtures of such colourants may also be used. It is contemplated that functionally equivalent dyes other than Neozapon Black RE and Hecto Black R may also be employed. Neozapon Black RE is believed to be similar to Acid Black 63, Colour Index No. 21295 andSolvent Black 27. Such dyes appear to be chromium complexel azo type dyes. Satisfactory results have been obtained when employing Neozapon Red BE, Neozapon Red GE, NeozaponFire Red G and Neozapon Blue FLE. In addition to the colourants discussed above, other dyes may be substituted or utilized in combination therewith. Suitable dyes include those of the basic type, for example of the C.I. Basic Blue, C.I. Basic Black and C.I. Basic Green types including methyl violet, ethyl violet, crystal blue, chrysoidine, Victoria Blue, rhodamine, auramine, etc. Mixtures of any of the illustrative dyes mentioned hereinabove may also be employed. Colourants may be incorporated in the composi tions in amounts up to about 5 e.g. 1 to 5 by weight of the ink. The Resin Binder. The resins suitable for use herein are classified as epoxy phenolic resins and as especially epoxy ethers of bisphenols. Such resins are well known in the art and are generally derived from the alkaline catalyzed reaction of epichlorohydrin with said bisphenols.Such classic epoxy resins known in the art as DGEBA resins are believed to have the form of a polyglycidyl or diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. The structure usually assigned to the product is EMI10.1 Suitable products vary from epoxy resins of the monomeric diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A N O or similar materials wherein NI, 2, 3 etc. Especially preferred are low molecular weight epoxy phenolic resins having viscosities in the range of about 100 to about 500. The prime requirement of the resin is that it must exhibit suitable solubility and compatibility with the other ink components for incorporation in the ink compositions according to this invention and it must be of sufficiently low viscosity so that the viscosity of the ink is not increased above about 3.0 centipoises. Particularly preferred are such epoxy phenolic resins available commercially under the trade mark Varcum from ReichholdChemicals, Inc. The resin component is critical since it is believed to convey the properties permitting the ink compositions to display the excellent printing and adhesion properties on a variety of substrates as aforementioned. The resin component preferably is in the range 4 to 20 by weight of the composition. The Solvent Blend. Although minor amounts of other solvents may be included if desired, the primary solvent blend is a mixture of water with alcoholic, ketonic and glycol ether species. The blend is a 25 to 90 e.g. 25 to 40 of one or more lower aliphatic monohydric alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, or a mixture thereof b optionally, 0 to 2046 of an organic compound selected from low molecular weight glycol ethers, including ethylene glycol monomethyl ether commonly known asMethyl Cellosolve , ethylene glycol monoethyl ether Cellosolve , propylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monoethyl ethers c O to 40, lower aliphatic ketones having 3 to 8 carbon atoms including methyl ethyl ketone, 2 heptanone, pentanone, 2 butanone, 2 hexanone and mixtures thereof and d 5 to 20 water.All percents are by weight of the blend unless otherwise specified. The concentration of water in the composition is critical to the successful practice of the invention since too much water will cause precipitation of the epoxy phenolic resin from the ink solution. Conversely, if a sufficient amount of water is not present, the viscosity of the ink will be too low and proper functioning of the composition in the ink jet printing apparatus will be impaired. In general, concentrations of 5 to 15, will be satisfactory. The ketone content is preferably 20 to 40 or 25 to 40 . Depending on substrate, the ketone content can preferably be 3296 or less, e.g. 25 to 3246. Other optional components may be added to the composition to convey special characteristics. A small amount of ammonia or similar alkalizing agent, in the form of concentrated aqueous sqlution may be added when necessary to maintain the system in a pH range of about 7 to 8.5. When used, such ammonia water 260 Baumé will be present in amounts of about 0 to 0.2, by weight of the total ink composition. Electrolytes are conventionally used in jet ink compositions to maintain the specific resistivity of the ink within desired limits. The ink compositions herein in most instances will have a specific resistivity within operable limits without the necessity of adding an electrolyte for this purpose. In general however, optimum results may be obtained by addition of electrolytic components that are soluble in the ink medium and which have no deleterious effect on the printing apparatus or on the printed substrate. Satisfactory compounds for this use include dimethyl amine hydrochloride sodium propionate, sodium acetate, etc. with sodium propionate being especially preferred. In general, an effective amount of such electrolytic composition will be in the range of O to 0.1 of the composition. The following examples are illustrative of ink compositions meeting the end use requirements discussed hereinabove and which are effective in jet printing operations. Example 1. The following ink composition was prepared from 342 ml. Methanol 342 ml. Methyl Ethyl Ketone 127.3g. Varcum 29 108 epoxy phenolic resin 79 ml. Isopropanol 140 ml. Distilled Water 18.6g.

The above inks were employed to print indicia onKapton polyimide polymer coated wire by jet ink printing.After application, both inks dried within 5 seconds.After drying, the wire printed with each ink was tested and found to be abrasion resistant to the extent that it remained legible at a minimum distance of 15 inches in minimum daylight after 20 rubs with an abrasive felt employing a 2 lb. pressure at a speed of 30 to 60 rubs per minute When the printed wire was immersed in a water solution containing 5 NaCl and a potential of 2,000 volt rms. applied for one minute between the primary conducter and an electrode, there was no dielectric breakdown in the primary wire insulation and the indicia remained legible. Indicia printed on the polymer coated wire remained legible after a 24 hour exposure in a weatherometer to alternating cycles of UV light and tap water spray. During more than 800 hours of operation of Ink 2 A in the jet printing units, evaporative losses from the ink supply system were compensated for by the addition, as needed of a makeup composition containing about 1590 ml. methanol, 1893 ml. methyl ethyl ketone, 167 ml. isopropyl alcohol, 125 ml. distilled water and 11 ml.methyl cellosolve. The above ink compositions were also employed to print indicia, by jet printing, on aluminium and steel beer cans as well as on glass bottles.

The inks showed excellent adhesion, dried in less than 5 seconds and exhibited good printability. Resistance to moisture and ultraviolet radiation was excellent. The above inks have been found to print on glass having condensed moisture on its surface with good adhesion. It will be seen from the aforegoing description of the invention that jet ink compositions are provided that are characterized by extremely useful adhesion and resistance properties making them suitable for use in a variety of applications.
