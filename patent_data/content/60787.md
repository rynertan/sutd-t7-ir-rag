## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL This invention relates to the preparation of ethylene glycol by the vapor phase hydrogenation of oxalate esters. The hydrogenation of alkyl esters over copper chromium oxide copper chromite at 2000C. to 2500C. to give the corresponding alkanols by the reaction EMI1.1 is well known. See Reactions of Hydrogen withOrganic Compounds over Copper Chromium Oxide and NickelCatalysts, by Homer Burton Adkins, The University ofWisconsin Press 1937 . Several prior art processes have been proposed for the preparation of alcohols and glycols by hydrogenation of certain esters of monobasic and higher dibasic acids in the liquid phase and esters of hydroxy acetic acid in vapor phase reaction systems. Of interest is an article by H. Adkins, in R.Adams et al, ed., Organic Reactions, Vol. VIII, Chapter 1, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, 1954, pp. 1 27 which sets forth a general mechanism for the liquid phase hydrogenation of esters to alcohols. It is noted therein that in the liquid phase, diethyl oxalate gives a good yield of ethylene glycol but only wit h a pressure much higher than normal liquid phase hydrogenation pressures, i.e., higher than 4000 psi. U.S. Patent No. 2,060,880 discloses a process for the hydrogenation of di alkyl esters of oxalic acid at a pressure in excess of 200 atmospheres over a copper chromite catalyst to produce ethylene glycol. Other esters of oxalic acid may also be employed. U.S. Pat No. 2,305,104 discloses a process for the vapor phase hydrogenation of alkyl esters of hydroxy acetic acid utilizing a dual catalyst charged reaction zone at temperatures between 1500C., and 3000C., and pressures from 10 to 1000 atmospheres or higher. British Pat Nos 555,240 and 575,380 disclose processes for the vapor phase catalytic hydrogenation of hydroxy acetic acid and its derivatives esters and an ester of glycollic acid respectively at temperatures ranging from 1500C. to 3000C., and pressures of from 10 to 1000 atmospheres to produce ethylene glycol. U.S. Pat. No. 4,112,245 discloses a process for the preparation of ethylene glycol by hydrogenation of oxalate esters in the vapor phase wherein the process is characterized by having a sulfur content in said oxalate ester less than 0.4 ppm and having an essentially sulfur free hydroaen in the presence of a copper containing hydrogenation catalyst. Although this patent states at column 4, lines 39 to 43 that By the process of the present invention hydrogenol ysis including the attendant problem of by product formation on the catalyst surface, as well as poisoning and deqradation of and loss of catalyst activity from the feed materials is substantially minimized , it is clear from the several examples that by product formation is present in significant quantities as indicated by the formation of substantial amounts of For a discussion on the effect of sulfur or chlorine containing compounds on the rate of hydrogenation of carboxylate esters, see Reactions ofHydrogen with Organic Compounds over Copper ChromiumOxide and Nickel Catalysts by Homer Burton Adkins, TheUniversity of Wisconsin Press, 1937 at Page 22. water in the examples.

The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,112,245 does not explain the relationship of the water formed in these examples and the hydrogenation process described therein the examples V to x may not be reproduced since the catalyst used therein has not been possible to reproduce from the disclosure , nor does the patent correlate the water formed in the process to by product formation, erg., by products such as 1,2 butanediol.It has been observed by applicants that by product formation, particularly the formation of 1,2 butanedial, is substantial when the water formed in the process is about 0.5 percent by weight based on the total weight of products formed. By reference to Table IV examples 4 to 15 of the instant application, as set forth hereinafter, the relationship of the measured water in the hydrogenation process to the amount of 1,2 butanediol formed is shown as follows Example Water1 1,2 butanediol1 2 HOH 1,2 butanediol 4 3.38 1.85 1.83 5 2.75 2.09 1.31 6 0.19 nil 7 0.28 nil 8 0.20 nil 9 0.25 nil 10 0.85 0.67 1.27 11 2.27 1.29 1.76 12 1.79 1.09 1.64 13 0.3z1 nil 14 0.24 nil 15 1.06 0.98 1.08 weight percent based on products formed. 2nil Indicates none detected. The foregoing suggests that 1,2 butanediol content tracks water content and is a predominant impurity when the water content Is about 1 weight percent. Typical of other reaction by products which can be formed during hydrogenation of dialkyl oxalates are water methanol ethanol ethylene glycol monoacetate Cellosolve TM 1,2 butanediol 2hydroxymethyl 1,3 dioxolane 2 methyl 1,3 dioxolane 2 methyl 4 ethyl 1,3 dioxolane ethyl glycolate and diethylene glycol. The presence of asymmetrical diols, especially 1,2 butanediol is highly undesirable and their presence is to be avoided. The ability to keep the formation of a by product below a predetermined level of formation is of particular interest, owing to the detrimental effect that a small quantity may have on the use of the ethylene glycol wherein it is contained. Of paramount commercial interest is the use of ethylene glycol in the manufacture of polyester fiber. When ethylene glycol contains small quantities of impurities, such as 1,2 butanediol, the overall properties of the polyester produced are changed. Thus, properties such as the dying characteristics of the polyester fiber, strength of the polyester fiber, color and the like, change in relation to the impurities present in the ethylene glycol employed in the manufacture of the polyester fiber. Since the manufacture of polyester fiber cannot reasonably tolerate even small variances in the properties of the produced polyester fiber, the ethylene glycol used in its manufacture must have a certain constant level of purity to insure that the chemical and physical properties of the polyester fiber are relatively constant. Unfortunately some impurities are extremely difficult to remove, yet ethylene glycol containing even minute quantities of such impurities, such as up to 1.0 percent by weight, is rendered commercially unusable. For example, if the impurity is 1,2 butanediol, the use of standard separation techniques is difficult. For example, if distillation is employed for separation, the separation is difficult owing to the fact that the boiling point of 1,2 butanediol at atmospheric pressure is about 1920C., whereas ethylene glycol has a boiling point of about 1980C. In addition, this asymmetrical diol is a hiqhly undesirable component in ethylene glycol owing to the effect it has the characteristics of polyester fiber made from ethylene glycol containing it.Thus, unless the formation of 1,2 butanediol is not more than about 1.0 percent by weight9 viz. 0.1 to 1.0 weight percent, the resulting ethylene glycol will be, for all practical purposes, unusable for use in the manufacture of polyester fiber, owing to the necessity of employing special purification processes, and thus will result in the use of such ethylene glycol for applications requiring lesser purity. This will necessarily decrease the commercial value of such ethylene glycol. Owing to the significant problem arising from the presence of 1,2 butanediol in the ethylene glycol formed from the hydrogenation of oxalate esters, it is desirable to have a process whereby the formation of 1,2 butanediol is not more than 1.0 percent by weight. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The instant process is for preparing of ethylene glycol containing not more than 1.0 percent byweight 1,2 butanediol which comprises reacting a stream of a vaporous mixture of hydrogen and an alkyl oxalate having the formula EMI6.1 wherein R is methyl or ethyl. The molar ratio of hydrogen to dialkyl oxalate in the reaction is greater than 4 1 and is at a pressure of between about 15 psia and about 1000 psia. The temperature is between about 1800C. and about 2400C., with a space velocity SV between about 3000 her 1 and about 25,000 hr 1 and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of between about 0.001 hr 1 and about 5.0 hr l The process is carried out over an effective amount of a solid coppercontaining hydrogenation catalyst.The process of this invention correlates the process conditions, i.e., temperature, pressure, SV and LHSV and molar ratio of hydrogen to dialkyl oxalate, such that not more than 1.0 percent by weight 1,2 butanediol is formed. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the preparation of ethylene glycol essentially free of deleterious amounts of 1,2 butanediol by the hydrogenation of methyl or ethyl oxalate in the vapor phase at elevated temperature in the presence of a copper containing hydrogenation catalyst. The hydrogenation reaction is believed to proceed as follows EMI7.1 tb SEP oq tb RO E OR SEP SEP 4H2 SEP Catalyst SEP HOCH2CH20H SEP SEP ROH tb ethylene alcohol glycol wherein R is methyl or ethyl. The reaction is believed to proceed stepwise according to equations 2 and 3 as follows EMI7.2 wherein R is as previously defined. As aforementioned, the oxalate esters which may be employed in the process of the invention have the general formula EMI8.1 wherein R is methyl or ethyl. The oxalate esters are preheated and vaporized, as may be determined by their vapor pressure, to insure that essentially all of the ester is in the vapor state when passed, along with hydrogen, over the catalyst bed. The catalyst bed is maintained at a temperature high enough to prevent condensation of the oxalate ester or the product ethylene glycol. In carrying out the hydrogenation of the oxalate ester, hydrogen is employed in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to convert the oxalate ester to ethylene glycol and the corresponding alcohol.Thus, the molar ratio of hydrogen to alkyl oxalate is greater than 4 1. The preferred molar ratio is between about 20 1 and about 135 1 and most preferably between about 30 1 and about 70 1. Higher or lower ratios of hydrogen to oxalate ester may be employed in the process provided the alkyl oxalate is in the vapor state and hydrogen is employed in the process in at least the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to alkyl oxalate of 4 1. Further, as long as greater than the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen is employed, a molar amount of inert gas, i.e., inert in the hydrogenation process, such as methane or nitrogen, may be provided such that the combined molar ratio of hydrogen and inert gas e.g.methane or nitrogen to the oxalate ester is between about 20 1 and about 135 1 and preferably between about 30 1 and about 70 1, although other molar ratios may be employed so long as the hydrogen to oxalate ratio is greater than 4 1. The hydrogenation catalysts employed in the process of the invention have been generally described in the prior art and any known solid copper containing hydrogenation catalyst, or mixture of solid copper containing catalysts, useful for the conversion of esters to alcohols may be employed. In general, hydrogenation catalysts containing copper either in the elemental form or combined with oxygen, as wetl as other hydrogenating metal oxides employed in conjunction with copper, supported or unsupported, may be used. Preferred catalysts are the copper zinc chromite or copper chromite catalysts which may be promoted with barium or sodium hydroxide and which have been reduced or partially reduced with hydrogen. Representative hydrogenation catalysts suitable for use in this invention include, for example, in addition to those above noted, zinc, copper, cadmium, chromite catalyst, copper ammonium chromate and zinc chromium oxide so long as at least some amount of a solid copper containing catalyst is present. Other catalysts which may be suitable for use in the process comprise compositions of tin, silver, cadmium, ruthenium, zinc or lead and oxides of these metals containing chromium in admixture with solid coppercontaining catalysts.Many suitable copper containing hydrogenation catalysts are commercially available such as copper zinc chromite catalyst, copper barium chromite cat alyst, sodium hydroxide promoted copper chromite and copper chromite catalysts such as Calsicat s TM CodeE 103TR Calsicat TM is a division of Mallinckrodt,Inc. . The relative activity of a given solid coppercontaining hydrogenation catalyst may be datermined by the rate in gram moles liter hour at which it produces the product ethylene glycol over a fixed period of time. A lower activity for a given catalyst is indicated by a lower rate relative to the rate of the catalyst as measured prior to any loss of activity from use in the process. In carrying out the examples, set forth hereinafter, a copper chromite hydrogenation catalyst,Calsicat TM Code No. E 103TR, was employed. The catalyst is purchased as. a pellet and then crushed such that the catalyst emoloyed for hydrogenation has an irregular shape and a particle size between about 8 to about 14 mesh U. S. Standard . This catalyst is partially reduced and stabilized, i.e., has at least a portion of the copper in the zero oxidation state, and has the following typical properties Copper content as CuO weight 47.0Chromium content as Cr203 weight X 47.0Crush strength ilbs. 20Surface area M g 90 100Bulk density lbs. ft 90 95 In the examples, the catalyst was diluted with a solid inert diluent of approximately an equal amount by volume. The solid inert diluent was an alpha alumina which has a relatively low surface area, a shaPe and size similar to that of the cooper chromite catalyst and possessed the following typical properties Chemical Composition Weight PercentAlpha Alumina 98.5 Silicon Dioxide 0.74Calcium Oxide 0.22Sodium Oxide 0.16Ferric Oxide 0.14Potassium Oxide O.Q4Magnesium Oxide 0.03Physical PropertiesSurface Areal 0.3 m2 gPore Volume 0.50 cc gPacking Density 0.70 g mlMedian Pore Diameter4 21 microns method of measurement described in Adsorption,Surface Area and Porosity , S.J.

OrrJr., Powder Technology, Vol. 3, pp. 117 123 1970 . Since the described solid copper chromite catalyst was partially reduced by the manufacturer, the catalyst was reduced further under hydrogen as follaws a the catalyst was purged with nitrogen at 10 psia to remove residual oxygen b a gaseous stream having 0.5 mole percent hydrogen in nitrogen was passed over the catalyst for a period of about 3 hours after having heated the catalyst to about 1400C. at a rate of from about 280C. to about 560C. per hour c the hydrogen content of the gaseous stream was increased from 0.5 mole percent to pure hydrogen as the temperature was increased to the operating temperature at the rate set forth in b above. The increase in hydrogen content in the gaseous stream is at such a rate that no or a minimal exotherm is observed.If such an exotherm is observed, the hydrogen content of the gaseous stream is decreased until the exotherm subsides. The increase in hydrogen content of the gaseous stream is then resumed and d the reduced catalyst, after having been used in the process for a period of time was regenerated by passing hydrogen over the catalyst at about 2180C. or the reaction temperature for about 1 S hours. As aforestated, the instant process is advantageous in that by correlating the process conditions, the formation of 1,2 butanediol is minimized such that the concentration is less than 1.0 percent by weight, preferably less than about 0.5 percent by weight, and most preferably less than about 0.1 percent by weight, based on the weight of ethylene glycol. As will be clear from the examples and as pointed out above, the amount of 1,2 butanediol formed in the process can be related to the amount of water formed in the process. In carrying out the process of the invention, the temperature of the hydrogenation catalyst is generally maintained between about 1800C. and about 2400C., preferably between 1900C. and about 2100C., and most preferably between about 2000C. and about 2100C. The selection of temperature is such that it is chosen between about 18O0C. and about 2400C. so that the formation of 1,2 butanediol in the process can be less than 1.0 percent by weight of products by correlating the temperature, pressure, space velocity and liquid hourly space velocity. The pressure employed in the process is not narrowly critical and is generally between about 15 psia and about 1000 psia, preferably between about 100 psia and about 1000 psia and most preferably between about 500 psia and about 1000 psia. In describing the process, it is desirable for the sake of brevity to refer to the space velocity as SV and liquid hourly space velocity as LHSV. The SV andLHSV are defined herein as SV Space Velocity , Her 1 F X 273 W X 1 X 22.4 273 T H M X X 1000 V where F Average gas flow rate, liter hour T Temperature of gas feed OC.

B Weight, percent, of diethyl oxalate in liquid product. W1 a Weight of liquid feed grams . W2 Weight of liquid product grams . The efficiency of the process is calculated by the equation Efficiency to ethylene glycol Yield Percent x 100 Conversion Percent The process is carried out with a space velocity of between about 3000 hr and about 25,000 hr 1 and preferably between about 8,000 her 1 and about 18,000 hr 1. The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between about 0.001 her 1 and about 5.0 hr 1 and preferably between about 1.0 hr 1 and about 3.0 her 1. In carrying out the examples purified diethyl oxalate and dimethyl oxalate feedstocks were used such that the feedstock was essentially sulfur and chlorine free. The phrase essentially sulfur and chlorine free is meant to refer to feedstocks that contain less than about 0.4 ppm each bf sulfur and chlorine and sulfur and chlorine containing compounds. A convenient method for removing such impurities from diethyl oxalate and dimethyl oxalate is set forth in U.S.P. 4,112,245 in column 5, lines 19 to 29, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. The use of an essentially sulfur or chlorine free system has been discussed above in the discussion of the prior art. Further, the hydrogen used in the process is similarly purified by a conventional gas scrubbing technique such that less than about 0.4 ppm each of sulfur and chlorine and sulfur and chlorine containing compounds are present. Typical of such conventional methods is the passing of the hydrogen through a bed of a mixture of Fe203 and fly ash, or through a bed ofCuO ZnO. The process may be carried out in any suitable reactor such as a continuous flow tubular reactor, wherein the oxalate ester is heated to the vapor state and admixed with hydrogen at the desired temperatures and pressures in the presence of a copper containing hydrogenation catalyst which may be in the form of a fixed or dynamic e.g., fluidized catalyst bed. The vapor phase hydrogenation reaction is exothermic in nature and the tubular reactor, if employed, is preferably cooled by external cooling means to maintain the reaction temperature in the desired range. The vaporous reaction products may be recovered and treated by any conventional process, e.g., distillation, and since the process is preferably carried out in a continuous manner said recovery process will preferably include recycling of hydrogen and like reusable components, such as the oxalate reactant. In the examples which follow the hydrogenation runs were carried out in a 1 inch inside diameter straight through tube reactor 3 feet 10 inches in Length, equipped with an external heating jacket 3300 watt winding to bring the catalyst bed to reaction temperature. A hydrogenation catalyst bed with solid inert dilutent as described above was positioned in the middle of the reactor tube and held in position with porous glass wool plugs. An electrically heated tube packed with Filtros TM packing was used to vaporize the oxalate ester prior to introduction into the hydrogenation reactor. Nitrogen and hydrogen were preheated to the reaction temperature in an electrically heated tube packed with Filtros TM packing.The vaporous product and by product effluent from the reactor were conducted into a straight through standard water cooled tempered water coil type condenser installed down stream from the reactor and then into a liquid gas separator. The condensate collected in the coil type condenser is degassed by gravity feeding it to a high pressure separator followed by a low pressure separator. Liquid and gaseous samples are then taken for analysis. The liquid reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography using a 10 foot x 1 8 inch stainless steel column packed with TENAX TM GC 60 80 mesh, using helium as the carrier gas 15 ml min with an injector temperature of about 909C. to about 3200C. with the temperature increasing at about 80C. per minute. A thermal conductivity detector maintained at 300 C. was used for detection.The following are typical retention times observed for the following compounds Compound Retention on Time min.

Two analyzers were equipped with thermal conductivity detectors and the third analyzer was equipped with a photometric flame ionization detector. In each case, the quantitation was by peak height measurement. The carrier gas was hydrogen 50 psia for the analyzer used for hydrogen detection. The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention in accordance with the above, but are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way. EXAMPLES 1 3 Examples 1 3 were carried out by charging 103 cubic centimeters of a copper chromite catalyst comprising 53 cubic centimeters of Calsicat TM cooper chromite Code E 103TR , prepared as above described, and. 50 cubic centimeters of the solid inert diluent above described1 in a tube reactor, as above described. Dimethyl oxalate and hydrogen, containing less than about 0.4 ppm sulfur and chlorine, were preheated at about 200 C., thereby vaporizing the dimethyl oxalate. The vaporized oxalate hydrogen mixture was introduced into the reactor and over the solid copper containing catalyst. Table I sets forth reaction conditions and some results for Examples 1 to 3.
