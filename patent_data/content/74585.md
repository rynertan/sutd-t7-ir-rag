## Description
Blue green emitting halophosphate phosphor, and fluorescent lamp employing the sameThis invention relates to a blue green emitting halophosphate phosphor and a fluorescent lamp employing said phosphor. More particularly, it relates to a blue green emitting halophosphate phosphor activated with divalent europium, and a high color rendering fluorescent lamp employing said phosphor and having radiation color temperature of 4200 to 5600 K Kelvin and average color rendering index Ra of not less than 95.Heretofore, it is known that halophosphate phosphors activated with divalent europium emit or generate blue or blue green fluorescence, as disclosed in JapanesePatent Publication No. 40604 1971 and U.S. Patent No.4,038,204. These phosphors, however, do not possess a satisfactory efficiency and are known to have such disadvantages as large deterioration in baking process in producing fluorescent lamps, or a poor lumen maintenance factor of produced lamps, when they are applied to fluorescent lamps.Calcium halophosphate phosphors activated with antimony and manganese are widely used for illumination fluorescent lamps for the general use. However, due to its poor color rendering, the use thereof is inadequate at places such as art museums and color printing factories where a high color rendering is required.There are known heretofore the following measures in order to solve the problem and achieve a high color rendering In one example, the emitting layer comprises a mixture of several kinds of phosphors so as to approximate the spectral energy distribution of the reference illuminant. In another example, mercury line at the visible short wavelength region hindering good color rendering is suppressed.Of the above, for the so called EDL Type lamps that is required to have especially a high color rendering, suppression of mercury line is effective for the improvement in color rendering. For this purpose, there are known a lamp having a double coated phosphor layer or one in which a separate pigment layer is provided.The former concerns a phosphor layer in which emission energy at 405 and 436 nm mercury line in the visible short wavelength region that hinders improvement in the color rendering is absorbed and, moreover, the absorbed energy itself is converted to the red color radiation, for example, a phosphor combination comprising a first layer of magnesium fluorogermanate activated with manganese 3.5 MgO, 0.5 MgF21 GeO2 Mn and a second layer of another phosphor coated thereon Japanese PatentPublication No. 9868 1966 .The latter is to provide a yellow pigment layer between a glass tube and a phosphor, whereby about 60 of 436 nm mercury line may be suppressed as compared with one in which no pigment layer is provided Japanese PatentPublication No. 15896 1973 . However, the known methods described above involve such disadvantages as production inefficiency due to complication of lamp manufacturing steps, variation of luminous color and color rendering caused by change in the thickness of pigment layer, or lowering of phosphor efficiency caused by absorption of emission energy.Recently, improvements in the above mentioned problems have been proposed Japanese Laid open Patent Application Nos. 102073 1979 and 115489 1980 . They fail, however, to fully improve the problems.In the former proposition Japanese Laid open PatentApplication No. 102073 1979 , at least four different species of phosphors including calcium halophosphate and zinc silicate phosphor must be used because the peak wavelength of the blue green phosphor employed is too short to bring chromaticity coordinate upon blackbody locus. This inevitably gives rise to such disadvantages as considerable variation of luminescence color and color rendering, and lowering of efficiency.The latter proposition brings about such advantages as high efficiency and superior color rendering. However, it also brings about difficulty in color control such as luminescence color and color rendering because three different species of phosphors, including blue and red color phosphors emitting within a narrow wavelength region, must be used admixed.In view of the above mentioned disadvantages, it is an object of this invention to provide blue green emitting phosphors having superior characteristics. Another object of this invention is to provide more efficient fluorescent lamps employing such phosphors, which may achieve a high color rendering by mixing only two kinds of phosphors without a layer of double coated phosphor or without a pigment layer.The inventors have paid attention to the importance of the blue green phosphors in obtaining a high color rendering, and studied intensively with various experiments to attain the above mentioned objects. As the result, they have foung out that a Ba Ca Mg system halophosphate phosphor activated with divalent europium has superior characteristics as compared with known halophosphate phosphors activated with divalent europium, and that a fluorescent lamp employing said phosphor and characterized by having the construction as described herein later shows remarkably a higher color rendering characteristics and superior emission efficiency as compared with known fluorescent lamps provided with a layer of double coated phosphor or a pigment layer and, at the same time, retards lowering of luminous flux during operation.According to this invention, there are provided a bluegreen emitting halophosphate phosphor activated with the divalent europium which is characterized in that it is represented by the general formula Herein after, this phosphor is often referred to as a phosphor i i EMI4.1 wherein, M consists of Ba, Ca and Mg X is one or more of F, CQ or Br and x is a positive value of less than 5 and a fluorescent lamp which comprises a mixture of a phosphor i comprising an alkaline earth metal halo phosphate activated with divalent europium, represented by the general formula as identified above, which has the emission peak at the wavelength region of 480 to 500 nm, and a phosphor ii having the emission peak at the wavelength region of 620 to 640 nm and the half width of 120 to 160 nm, said mixture being coated inside of a glass tube.A phosphor having superior characteristics can be obtained by selecting the value of Mg in M in the range of from 0.01 to 1.0 gram atom in the above mentioned general formula. In the above general formula, the subscript x denotes gram atom value of the divalent europium and is so determined as to satisfy the inequality 0 x 5, preferably 0.01 x 0.2. When the subscript x is not more than 0.01, luminescence intensity of the produced phosphor will be severely decreased. When it is more than 0.2, luminescence intensity of a produced phosphor will not remarkably be improved any more. It is more preferable that the value of x is determined to be 0.03 x 0.15. Furthermore, M should preferably consist of 3 X 4.5 gram atom of Ba, 0.5 X 2 gram atom of Ca and 0.01 X 1 gram atom of Mg. Where Ba 3 X 4.5 and Ca 0.5 b 2, a remarkable improvement in luminescence intensity is not achieved if the substituted amount of Mg is less than 0.01, as opposed to the case where only Ba and Ca are present. Presence of more than 1 gram atom of Mg will rather lower luminescence intensity. It is more preferable that the amount of Mg is set to be 0.1 X 0.5 gramatom.The phosphor i according to the invention may be prepared in the following manner Namely, predetermined amount of various compounds such as oxides, phosphates, carbonates and ammonium salts that may form Ba, Ca, Mg,P, F, C, Br and Eu by firing are weighed. The material mixture is thoroughly pulverized and mixed, for example, with a ball mill. The mixture is then placed in a alumina or quartz crucible and fired in air for 1 X 5 hours at 800 X 12000C. The fired product is allowed to cool, pulverized and sieved, then again fired at 800 X 12000C in a slightly reducing atmosphere of, for example, a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen.The twice fired product is allowed to cool, pulverized, sieved, washed, filtered, dried and again sieved to give the phospor i of the invention.In a fluorescent lamp according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the characteristics superior to a prior art may be obtained within color temperature range of 4000 X 5000 K by admixing at a suitable mixing ratio the above mentioned phosphor i with, as the phospor ii , a strontium magnesium orthophosphate phosphor activated with tin.A characteristic feature of the above mentioned phosphor i , i.e. the alkaline earth metal halophosphate phosphor activated with divalent europium to be employed for the fluorescent lamp of this invention is that there may be obtained diverse phosphors having the emission peak within the wavelength region of 480 X 500 nm by changing the mixing ratio of Ba, Ca and Mg of M in the abovementioned general formula M5xX PO4 3 Eu2 x An advantage derived from the capability of shifting the emission peak is that a fluorescent lamp having superior characteristics within any range from a low color temperature 4000 K to a high color temperature 5600 K may be obtained by the sole combination of the alkaline earth metal halophosphate phosphor phosphor i with the phosphor ii having the peak wavelength of 620 640 nm and the half width of 120 X 960 nm, without any further phosphors. In addition, the phosphor i herein disclosed is of quite a high efficiency and stability.A EDL Type fluorescent lamp using only two kinds of phosphors has been proposed Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 27554 1981 . However, no fluorescent lamp of sufficient characteristics may be obtained with this combination of phosphors, because Sr, AQ 3 PO4 2 Cu phosphor employed therein has rather poor efficiency and maintenance of luminous flux during operation.This invention will be explained in more detail by the following Examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings.In the drawings Figure 1 shows curves indicating the relationship of Mg fraction expressed in gram atom with 1 relative luminescence intensity, 2 maintenance factor A, and 3 maintenance factor B of the phosphor according to the invention Figure 2 shows a curve indicating the relationship ofCa fraction expressed in gram atom with the relative luminescence intensity of the phosphor Figure 3 shows a curve indicating the relationship ofEu fraction expressed in gram atom with relative luminescence intensity of the phosphor andFugure 4 shows the spectral energy distributions of emission under 254 nm ultraviolet ray excitation of representative phosphors according to the invention Figure 5 shows spectral energy distributions of emission of each phosphor employed in the fluorescent lamp of the invention Figure 6 shows chromaticity of emission color of the fluorescent lamp Figure 7 shows spectral energy distributions of emission of the fluorescent lamps indicated in Examples 4 to 6, in comparison with prior art having the double layer coating andFigure 8 shows the cross sectional schematic view of the fluorescent lamp of the invention.Example 1.In the phosphor represented by the formula M5xX PO4 3 Eu2 shown in Table 1 infra, X was made to be CQ and x were fixed to be 0.05, whereas M was varied to give the phosphors Nos. 1 10 in Table 1 . For comparison, a conventional phosphor containing no Mg was similarly prepared No. 21 .Each material mixture was pulverized, blended in a ball mill for 2 hours and then sieved. The mixture was placed in a quartz crucible and fired in air at 950 C for 3 hours. The fired product obtained in this manner was allowed to cool, pulverized and sieved, then fired again at 9500C for 1 hour in a mixed gas containing 2 hydrogen and 98 nitrogen.The fired product was allowed to cool, pulverized, sieved, washed, filtered, dried and sieved again to give the phosphor specimen. Each specimen was confirmed by chemical analysis to have the stoichiometric composition.The crystal structure of the specimen was confirmed to be a perfect chloroapatite structure by X ray diffraction pattern analysis. Further, it turned out that the lattice constant has changed in accordance with the mixing ratio of Ba, Ca and Mg.The specimens thus obtained were tested for 1 relative luminescence intensity, 2 maintenance factor A, and 3 maintenance factor B. The results are shown inFigure 1 in correspondence to gram atom value of Mg admixed. The most preferable results are obtained when the amount of Mg is set to be 0.15 X 0.3 gram atom. The tests were performed in the following manner, respectively 1 Relative luminescence intensity The relative value of luminescence intensity of a specimen when excited by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation in comparison to luminescence intensity 100.0 of control No. 11 in Table 1 excited in the same manner. The relative value has close correlation to the initial luminous flux when applied to a fluorescent lamps. 2 Maintenance factor A The ratio of luminescence intensity before and after baking in air at 6000C for 10 minutes expressed by the following formula luminescence intensity after baking x 100 luminescence intensity before baking This value can be correlated to the deterioration of luminescence intensity in baking process when fluorescent lamps are produced. 3 Maintenance factor B The ratio of luminescence intensity before and after irradiation of specimen for 4 hours by ultraviolet radiation containing strong 185 nm line emission from a quartz low pressure mercury lamp and indicated by the formula luminescence intensity after irradiation of ultraviolet ray for 4 hours x 100 luminescence intensity without irradiation This value can be correlated to lumen maintenance factor when applied to fluorescent lamps.Example 2. In the phosphor represented by the formula M5 XX PO4 3 Eu x shown in Table 1 infra, X was made to be CQ and x and Mg were fixed to 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, whereas mixing ratio of Ba and Ca in M was varied to give the phosphors Nos. 11 14 in Table 1 , according to the same procedures as in Example 1.The specimen were similarly tested for luminescence intensity by 254 nm ultraviolet excitation.In this case, the figures represent relative luminescence intensity, when that of specimen No. 21 in Table 1 is set for 100.0. The results are shown in Figure 2 in correspondence to gram atom values of Ca admixed.Example 3. In the phosphor represented by the formula M5 PO4 3 Eu x shown in Table 1 infra, X was made to be CQ andCa and Mg were fixed to 1.0 and 0.2, respectively, whereas Ba in M and Eu x were varied to give the phosphors Nos. 15 20 in Table 1 , according to the same procedures as in Example 1. The specimens were similarly tested for luminescence intensity by 254 nm ultraviolet excitation.In this case, the figures represent relative luminescence intensity, when that of specimen No. 21 in Table 1 prior art is set for 100.0. The results are shown inFigure 3 in correspondence to gram atom values of Ca admixed.Figure 4 shows spectral energy distribution of emission of the phosphors according to the invention No. 12 andNo. 13 in Table 1 according to Example 2 as the representatives when excited by ultraviolet ray at 254 nm.
