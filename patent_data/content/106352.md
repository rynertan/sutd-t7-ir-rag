# Novel polymer composition.

## Abstract
A polymer composition in which an organic polymer and carbon fiber are strongly combined and a process for producing the polymer composition by the electrolytic polymerization of a reactive monomer using the carbon fiber as an electrode, which process is characterized in that the polymerization is carried out by adding an aliphatic epoxy compound, alicyclic epoxy compound, organic titanate com pound, or vinylsilane compound, as part or all of the reactive monomer.
