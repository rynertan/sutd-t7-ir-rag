# Fuel fired fluid heating appliance.

## Abstract
A fuel fired fluid heating appliance, such as a gas fired boiler is provided for heating a fluid such as water circulating in a central heating system. The boiler includes a flue 4 for discharging the combustion preducts, eg. exhaust gas, to atmosphere by way of a heat exchanger 8 incorpo rated within a portion 6 of the flue 4 external of the boiler housing 1. The heat exchanger 8 is provided with an inlet 16 to receive water from a return flow pipe 36 and an outlet 17 to discharge the water to the inlet 35 of the boiler primary heat exchanger 3. The heat exchanger 8 is pro vided with a number of ducts 18 along which the exhaust gas travels to transfer its heat to the water circulating within compartments 29 to 33 within the heat exchanger housing 15. The external portion 6 of the flue 4 is disposed at an angle of 20 downwardly to the horizontal so that any exhaust gas condensing in the heat exchanger 8 flows down the flue base 9 to a discharge spout 10 and collector weir 11. In an alternative arrangement, the condensate outlet 45 is located at the base of the flue 40 within the boiler, the outlet 45 terminating outside the boiler housing 1. In this case that portion 42 of the flue external of the boiler and incorporating the heat exchanger slopes upwardly at an angle of 20 to the horizontal.
