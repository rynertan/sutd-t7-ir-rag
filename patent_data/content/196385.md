## Description
The invention relates generally to dispensers and in particular to dispensers for semi solid material in stick form which have a tubular barrel for housing the material and are provided with a drive mechanism for moving the material axially to and fro along the barrel for dispensing material at an open end of the barrel. In a known dispenser of this type the drive mechanism comprises an actuator adapted to be rotated by hand, and an elevator which is driven axially of the barrel to move material therealong. The actuator comprises a knurled drive wheel held captive for rotation by an inwardly directed radial flange at one end of the barrel, and a threaded spindle extending axially inside the barrel. The elevator comprises a unitary moulding screwed onto the spindle such that rotation of the drive wheel causes the elevator to move axially along the barrel. Dispensers of this type are particularly suited for dispensing deodorant and other semi solid materials in stick form. The stick is formed in situ from a liquid, usually but not necessarily molten, which is introduced into the barrel and allowed to solidify. The stick must be sufficiently well attached to the elevator for the elevator to be able to push the stick along the barrel for use and to withdraw it subsequently against the frictional resistance presented by the interior of the barrel. A known method of manufacture is to assemble the dispenser by inserting the elevator into the barrel through the dispensing end thereof and to introduce the actuator through the opposite end of the barrel so that the elevator is engaged on the spindle and the drive wheel is located by the radial flange. The barrel is then top filled with hot liquid through the dispensing end thereof. However, the assembly of the elevator with the actuator is a slow and expensive part of the process, and a stick filled in this way tends to shrink on cooling, with the result that its free surface adopts a concave profile. This is undesirable for aesthetic and practical reasons. It is thus desirable to fill the barrel when inverted, through the end in which the actuator is located when assembled. Bottom fill of the dispenser through the central orifice provided in the elevator when the actuator is disassembled therefrom cannot be undertaken with the conventional design of dispenser, since this orifice is of insufficient dimension to allow uninterrupted flow of the product, which may be a suspension with a high solids content and liable to set on any obstruction which is presented. One solution to this problem which has been adopted in the prior art is to omit the inwardly directed radial flange which holds the actuator captive, and to replace it with a suitable formation over which the drive wheel of the actuator is clipped and which thereafter holds the actuator captive for rotation. In this case the elevator and actuator can be preassembled together and clipped on to the barrel after filling when the product is still in a liquid phase. This of course is not possible when an inwardly directed radial flange is provided, since the elevator must then be inserted into the barrel through the dispensing end of the barrel. In the absence of the radial flange the barrel presents a full diameter filling aperture, so that from the point of view of both filling speed and assembly, a modification of this kind has proved satisfactory for dispensers of essentially circular cross section. However, the current move is strongly towards non circular e.g. oval barrels, and for these dispensers the modification is not appropriate, requiring as it does a barrel cross section which is circular to enable the drive wheel to rotate on it. FR A 1529772 describes a dispenser in which an elevator is inserted through the dispensing end of the barrel after assembly on a spindle. A wheel is then fixed to the end of the spindle which passes through the end wall of the barrel. In an alternative embodiment the elevator is formed from radially inner and outer portions to overcome problems arising through differential contraction of elements of the dispenser during cooling of the semi solid material. It is not possible, however, to fill this dispenser through its bottom end wall. US A 4369158 describes a dispenser which can be bottom filled before snap fitting of a twist up assembly to a small radially directed flange extending inwardly from the otherwise completely open bottom end of the barrel. Since the barrel is of oval cross section, however, the twist up assembly includes a base in the form of an oval plug for fitting to the flange the drive wheel and spindle being supported for rotation on the plug. There are thus four conflicting requirements which should desirably be satisfied. The first is the requirement for preassembly of the elevator on the actuator to allow for fast production the second is the requirement for a large diameter filling aperture the third is the requirement that the dispenser be bottom filled and the fourth is that the dispenser design should have a capability for use with non circular barrels without the need to provide an additional element in the form of a base or plug for the bottom end of the barrel. According to the invention there is provided a dispenser for semi solid material in stick form, having a tubular barrel for housing the material and a drive mechanism for moving material axially of the barrel for dispensing at an open end thereof, the drive mechanism comprising an actuator having a manually operated drive wheel held captive, after assembly onto the barrel, for rotation at the end of the barrel opposite the dispensing end, and an elevator which is driven axially of the barrel to move material therealong on rotation of the actuator, the elevator comprising a radially outer annular part adapted to engage and hold the material for moving the same along the barrel in either direction and having a central orifice adapted to receive a radially inner annular part separate from the radially outer annular part and adapted to be drivingly engaged by the actuator, and the radially inner and radially outer annular parts of the elevator being held against relative movement after assembly thereof together, characterised in that the product is filled into the barrel via the central orifice of the radially outer annular part, and the radially inner annular part of the elevator, after assembly with the actuator, is passed into assembled relation with the radially outer annular part of the elevator. Assembly of a dispenser according to the invention can be carried out by the steps of The invention may be applied equally to dispensers having circular or non circular e.g. oval barrels. As will be understood, the actuator and the inner part of the elevator may be identical for those with circular or non circular barrels. The radially outer part of the elevator will have a cross sectional shape which conforms to the internal profile of the barrel. In an embodiment of the invention, a secondary cover is fitted over the dispensing end of the barrel to form a mould for that end of a deodorant stick the secondary cover is shaped so as to leave the deodorant stick with a profiled protruding end when first opened by the consumer. An outer cap is also provided, arranged to cover the secondary cover. The outer cap and secondary cover are attached to the barrel before step b of the previous paragraph is performed. Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring to Figure 1 the dispenser comprises a tubular barrel 1 which is closed at the dispensing end by a removable screw cap 2. The other end of the barrel is partly closed by an integral radial flange 3 by which an actuator 4 is held captive for rotation. To this end, the actuator is provided with an outwardly extending radial flange which can be snap fitted over the radial flange 3. The actuator comprises a knurled drive wheel 5 connected to an axially extending screw threaded spindle 6 the wheel 5 being accessible for manual operation by a user. An elevator 7 which carries a stick of deodorant material for forward and backward movement along the barrel as the actuator is rotated one way or the other comprises a radially outer annular part 8 and a radially inner annular part 9, and is threaded on to the spindle 6 by means of a central threaded bore in its inner part 9. The outer part 8 of the elevator is fitted into the barrel and moves axially of the barrel with the inner part 9 as the wheel 5 is rotated. Longitudinally extending and circumferentially spaced splines 23 are moulded to project from the inside wall of the barrel. In conventional manner they are dimensioned and profiled so as to deeply indent a sealing flange 24 which is formed around the periphery of the elevator adjacent the product. They thereby prevent the elevator rotating when the actuator 4 is operated. A secondary cover 11 is provided at the dispensing end of the dispenser. This secondary cover is shaped to provide the desired end form to the deodorant stick 10 and, like the screw cap 2, is removed by the consumer when dispensing is required. The secondary cover may then be discarded, but the screw cap is ratained for reclosure. As shown, the secondary cover has a peripheral flange 22 which is pressed by the screw cap against the free end surface of the barrel 1 so as to form an airtight seal for the deodorant stick to the point of first use. The inner and outer parts 8,9 of the elevator 7 are restrained from relative rotation by interlocking splines 12. In addition, a plurality of resilient fingers 13 integral with the inner part 9 engage on an inwardly directed annular flange 14 formed on the outer part 8 and are effective to hold the two parts together axially. In the fully retracted position, the outer part 8 of the elevator engages the actuator 4 by means of a sealing skirt 15. Figures 2 and 3 show an alternative embodiment of the dispenser wherein the barrel is of an oval rather than circular cross section. The actuator 4 and the inner part 9 of the elevator 7 are however of identical construction to that of Figure 1. The outer part 8 of the elevator will naturally have an oval configuration in this case to conform to the internal dimensions of the barrel. The non circularity of the elevator part 8 and the barrel will prevent rotation of the elevator when the actuator 4 is operated no formations such as the splines 23 of Figure 1 are therefore provided. In both the embodiments described, the inner part 9 of the elevator is of a substantially frusto conical configuration and is received within the outer part 8 and engages therewith over a frusto conical surface. The outer part 8 comprises an outer wall 16 connected to an inner wall 17 by means of a web 18. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, vent holes 19 may be provided in the web to provide for the escape of air during bottom filling and to provide hydraulic cushioning when the inner part 9 of the elevator and the spindle 6 of the actuator 4 are immersed in the liquid deodorant material as is later to be described. Referring to Figure 3, circumferentially spaced and longitudinally extending rub strips 20 are formed to project from the surface of the elevator. These rub strips prevent any substantial yawing movements of the elevator 7 as it moves along the barrel 2. Similar strips not shown are provided on the elevator 7 of the embodiment of Figure 1, for the same purpose. They are located between the anti rotation splines 23 circumferentially of the dispenser. As shown in Figures 2 and 4 the web 18 may be provided with upstanding hollow posts 25 which assist in keying the stick of material to the elevator. These posts are provided with apertures 26 to allow the material to flow into them during filling. Referring to Figure 4, the filling orifice 21 which the part 8 provides is clearly shown, being defined by the inner surface of the annular flange 14. Filling and assembly of the dispenser is as follows The embodiment shown in Figure 5 provides a modification which enables the outer part 8 of the elevator to be held in position whilst the dispenser is filled and whilst the inner part 9 of the elevator is pushed into locking engagement therewith. The bottom of the inner wall 17 of the part 8 is profiled to form a latch 30 by means of which the part 8 can be snapped into holding engagement with the radial flange 3 prior to filling of the dispenser. After the dispenser has been filled the actuator, with the inner part of the elevator assembled thereon, is inserted through the outer part 8 until the fingers 13 engage over the flange 14, and during this operation the outer part 8 is held in position by the engagement of the latch 30 with the flange 3. After the inner and outer parts of the elevator have become locked together the actuator is pushed further into the dispenser causing the latch 30 to disengage from the flange 3 and for the outwardly extending flange 31 to be snap fitted over the flange 3. For this sequence of events to occur satisfactorily it is of course necessary for the force required to engage the inner and outer parts of the elevator to be less than the force required to disengage the latch 30 from the flange 3. This modification can be applied to any of the embodiments described. The embodiment shown in Figure 6 shows a further modification which has particular application in a dispenser of smaller dimension in terms of the overall length of the barrel. In this modification the latching arrangement provided in other embodiments by the finger 13 and the annular flange 14 is replaced. A chamferred portion 32 of the inner part 9 of the elevator is pushed through an opening defined by a frusto conical portion 33 of the outer part 8. The portion 33 is provided with a number of circumferentially spaced slots not shown which divide it into a plurality of resilient fingers 34 which enable it to expand resiliently as the chamferred portion 32 of the part 9 is pushed therethrough and subsequently to snap back into an annular recess 33 on the part 9 and into engagement with a shoulder 35. This modification can be applied equally to any of the embodiments described. Filling and assembly of dispensers as modified in Figures 5 and 6 is the same as for the embodiments of Figures 1 4 except that, as already described, the outer part 8 of the elevator is engaged with the flange 30 prior to filling, and disengaged therefrom after the inner and outer parts of the elevator have been locked together. The individual components 1,2,4,8,9, and 11 of the described embodiments are each injection moulded from a suitable thermoplastics material for example, items 1,2 and 4 may be of polypropylene, item 8 of high density polyethylene, item 9 of acetal, and item 11 of polystyrene. If desired, however, a dispenser in accordance with the invention may include one or more metal components.
