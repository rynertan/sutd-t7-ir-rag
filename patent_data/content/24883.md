# Semiconductor integrated memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit memory device includes a memory cell array of integrated injection logic memory cells Ce . The cells Ce are arranged in matrix form of columns and rows R with word lines W and bit lines B connected to the memory cells Ce . The word lines W are formed by a semicondctor bulk and only a single current source Qâ‚‡ is provided for each word line W and this is connected around the mid point of each word line W .
