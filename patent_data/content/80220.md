## Description
DIHYDROPYRIDINES, METHODS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AND THEIRFORMULATION AND USE AS PHARMACEUTICALS This invention relates to new compounds, methods for their preparation and compositions containing them. According to the invention we provide compounds of formula I,EMI1.1 in which X is oxygen or sulphur, R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each represent alkyl C 1 to 6, CH2 n OR5, or CH2 n NR6R7, and in addition R2 may represent hydrogen, n is a whole number from 2 to 4 inclusive, R3 represents CH20H, CN, CH OR4 2, CHO, CH NOH, CF3, or, together with R2 forms a chain CHOR , R4 represents alkyl C 1 to 6, R5 represents alkyl C1 to 6 or phenyl, R6 and R7, which may be the same or different, each represent alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by phenyl, and R8 is alkyl C1 to 6, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of those compounds containing a basic nitrogen atom. According to the invention we also provided a process for the production of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, which comprises a production of a compound of formula I in whichR3 is CH OR4 2 by i reaction of a compound of formula II,EMI2.1 in which Rg is a group CF3 or CH OR4 2, X, R2 and R4 are as defined above, with a compound of formula III, R1OOCCH C R8 NH2 III in which R1 and R8 are as defined above, or ii reaction of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is CHO with an alcohol R4OH, b production of a compound of formula I in which R3 is CHO by selective hydrolysis of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is CH OR4 2, c production of a compound of formula I in whichR3 is CH NOH by reaction of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is CHO with hydroxylamine, or a salt thereof, d production of a compound of formula I in whichR3 is CN by dehydration of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is CH NOH, e production of a compound of formula I in whichR3 is CH2OH by selective reduction of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is CHO, f production of a compound of formula I in whichR2 is hydrogen, by selective hydrolysis of a corresponding compound of formula I in which COOR2 is an ester group, g production of a compound of formula I in whichR2 is other than hydrogen by esterification, with a compound R2L in which L is a leaving group, of a corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is hydrogen, or R2 together with R3 forms a chain CHOH , or h selective reduction of a corresponding pyridine, and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, or vice versa. Process a i may be carried out at a temperature of from about 50 to 150 0C. The reaction may be carried out in an excess of the compound of formula III, or, less preferably, in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. a polar solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxan or dimethylformamide. We prefer R2 to be methyl or ethyl. Process a ii may be carried out in the presence of an excess of the alcohol and preferably in the presence of an acidic catalyst. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 50 to 1500C. In processes a i and a ii we prefer R2 not to be hydrogen. The hydrolysis of process b may be carried out using an aqueous acid, for example hydrochloric acid e.g. 0.5 to 2.5 molar , in a water miscible organic solvent, e.g.acetone or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 20 to 500C. The reaction is preferably not carried out for more than about 6 hours. Process c may be carried out in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetic acid or ethanol, and in the presence of a basic catalyst, e.g. sodium acetate or sodium carbonate.The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 20 to 1200C. The dehydration of process d may be carried out using a variety of dehydrating agents, e.g. an excess of acetic anhydride, thionyl chloride in ether orN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in pyridine. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 0 to 1500C depending on the reagent and solvent used. The reduction of process e may be carried out either chemically or catalytically, e.g. by use of sodium borohydride in an alcoholic solvent, e.g. methanol or ethanol at a temperature of from about 0 to 500C. Process f may be carried out under similar, but comparatively more forcing, conditions to process b above, e.g. temperature of up to 1000C, reaction time of 24 to 72 hours and stronger acid, e.g. 2.5 to 5 molarHCl. We prefer the process to be carried out using a starting material in which R3 is CHO. Processes b and f may be carried out simultaneously under the more forcing conditions of process f . In process g the leaving group is preferably an anion forming group, e.g. chlorine, bromine, iodine, methanesulphonate or p toluenesulphonate. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 20 to 100 0C and in a polar solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. acetone, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide and in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium or potassium carbonate. The reduction of process h may be carried out using an appropriate reducing agent, eg a dithionate such as sodium dithionate, in an aqueous organic solvent, for example aqueous ethanol or aqueous dioxan. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from about 200 to 800C. In the above processes where R2 is CH2 nNR6R7 the reaction may be carried out using, and may, where appropriate produce, a compound in the form of an acid addition salt thereof. Such processes are included within the scope of the invention. Compounds of formula II may be made by the reaction of a compound of formula IV,EMI6.1 in which X is as defined above, with a compound of formula V, R2OOCCH2COR9 V in which R2 and Rg are as defined above. The reaction may be carried out in refluxing benzene or toluene in the presence of an organic base or an anhydrous acid, the water produced being removed by azeotropic distillation. Alternatively compounds of formula II may be made by reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of.formula VI,EMI7.1 in which X is as defined above, in the presence of a basic catalyst. Compounds of formulae III, IV, V, and VI and the pyridine starting materials for process h are either known or may be made fran known compounds using conventional techniques known per se. The pyridine starting materials for process h may also be made by selective oxidation, e.g. using dichlorodicyano benzoquinone in an organic solvent such as chloroform, of the corresponding dihydropyridine of formula I. The compounds of formula I, and the intermediates therefor, may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional processes known per se. The compounds of formula I possess an asymetric carbon atom and the invention provides the compounds in optically active form or as racemic or other mixtures.The optical isomers may be separated by conventional procedures which are known per se. We prefer X to be oxygen. We also prefer R1, R2 and R4 to be selected from methyl, and, more preferably, ethyl and isopropyl. In particular R1 and R2 can both be ethyl or methyl, or one can be methyl or ethyl and the other isopropyl. n is preferably 2. R3 is preferably CH20H or especially CHO or CN. We also prefer the benzofurazanyl or benzothiadiazolyl group to be attached to the tetrahydropyridine moiety through its 4 position.R8 is preferably C1 to 4 and most preferably is methyl.Compounds of formula I containing a basic nitrogen atom include those in which R2 is CH2 NR6R7. We prefer the compounds of Examples 3, 4 ii , 7, 10 ii , 10 iii , 12 ii , 12 iii and particularly 11. The compounds of formula I, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful because they possess pharmacological properties in animals. More particularly they block the entry of calcium into vascular and cardiac muscle leading to a fall in blood pressure, inotropy and heart rate. They are active in the following systems a Relaxation of contracted vascular smooth muscle. Van Breemen, Aaronson, Loutzenhiser and Meisheri, Chest, 78, Supplement, 157 165, 1980. b Reduce inotropy and chronotropy of isolated atria. Henry, Excerpta Med. Int. Congr. Ser., 474, 14 23, 1979. c Reduce blood pressure and increase cardiac output in anaesthetised dogs. Hirakawa, Ito, Kondo,Watanbe, Hiei, Banno Hyase, Arzneim Forsch, 22, 344 349, 1972. d Reduce blood pressure with small rises in heart rate in conscious dogs when given by the intravenous and oral routes. Newman, Bishop, Peterson, Leroux Horowitz,J Pharm. Exp. Ther. 201, 723 730, 1977. The compounds are thus indicated for use in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, variant angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disorders, vascular disease and in asthmatic conditions. For the above uses the dosage will depend upon the compound used, the route of administration and the effect desired, but in general will be in the range of 0.1 lOmg per kilogram body weight per day. For man the indicated total daily dose will be from about 5 500mg, preferably from 5 to 200mg and more preferably from 5 to 100mg, which may be administered in divided doses of about 1 200mg, preferably 2 to 25mg, e.g. 2 to 4 times per day. The compounds of formula I are advantageous in that they possess greater potency e.g. with respect to direct negative chronotropic effect , produce a lower level of reflex tachycardia, are more selective e.g. for vascular smooth muscle vs cardiac muscle , produce less depression of cardiac contractility, are longer acting, are more easily formulated, possess less, or less undesirable, side effects or have other more beneficial properties than known compounds of similar structure. The compounds of the invention may be administered by a wide variety of routes and may act systemically or locally. Thus the compounds may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation to the lung, to the buccal cavity, oesophageally, rectally, topically to the skin or to other available surfaces of the body by injection, eg intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or by surgical implant. According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably less than 80 and more preferably less than 50 by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets, capsules and dragees microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, calcium phosphate, diatomaceous earth, a sugar such as lactose, dextrose or mannitol, talc, stearic acid, starch, sodium bicarbonate and or gelatin for suppositories natural or hardened oil or waxes and for inhalation compositions, coarse lactose. The compounds may also be formulated in controlled release form, e.g. in the form of a matrix out of which the compound is slowly leached. The compounds may also, if desired, be used in admixture with other pharmaceutically active compounds, e.g. a beta blocker. Compounds of formula I in which R2 is hydrogen andR3 is CHO may exist in the tautomeric form Ia,EMI11.1 i.e. a form in which R3 together with R2 forms a chain CHOH . The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited by the following Examples in which temperatures are indegrees centigrade.Example 1Diethyl 4 4 benzofurazanyl 2 diethoxymethyl 1,4 dihydro 6 methylpyridine 3,5 dicarboxylate A solution of 4 benzofurazancarboxaldehyde 6.0g, 40 moles , ethyl 4,4 diethoxy 3 oxobutyrate 8.0g, 37 mmoles and piperidine 0.5ml in dry benzene 150ml was heated at reflux using a Dean and Stark water separator for 3 hours.
