## Description
OXIDATION OF OLEFINS TO OXIRANE COMPOUNDS WITH PERIODATE COMPOUNDS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING ALKALI METAL MONO AND DIBASIC PERIODATES The present invention pertains to a new process for oxidizing olefins with periodate compounds to produce oxiranes, and to a process for preparing monobasic and dibasic alkali metal periodates from tribasic, tetrabasic or pentabasic alkali metal periodates.Preparation oi Oxiranes from Olefins Olefins have been oxidized to form oxirane compounds by various methods such as by the dehydrcchlorination of chlorohydrins, P. P. McClellan, Ind. Eng. Chein., Vol. 42, 12 1950 , pp. 2402 7 , the reaction of hydroperoxides with olefins in the presence of catalysts U S. Patent 3,351,635 and R. Landau, et al.,Seventh World Petroleum Conference Proceedings, Vol. 5, 1967 , pp. 67 72 . It is well known that ethylene can be converted to ethylene oxide by the direct vapor phase oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen in the presence of a silver catalyst. Olefins have also been oxidized to form oxirane compounds by treatment with organic peracids such as peracetic acid, monoperphthalic acid and perbenzoic acid U.S. Patent 3,341,556 and Chem.Revs. Vol. 45, 1949 pp. 16 25 . The present invention there for provides an alternative Tnethod for the preparation of oxirane compounds from compounds containing olefinic unsaturation, said method leaving the following characteristics and or advantages compared with known processes for preparing oxirane compounds 1. A relatively high selectivity to the desired oxirane product 2. A minimum of non useful by products 3. No chlorine containing co product is produced 4. Numerous olefins can be epoxidized 5. The process can be conducted whether the periodate is in the liquid or solid state and 6. The separation of the oxirane compounds from the periodate is relatively easy, especially when the periodate is a solid. The present invention resides in a process for forming an oxirane compound, characterized by contactillg a compound containing olefinic unsaturation or a mixture thereof with a periodate represented by the formulasMIO4, NH41O6, and M2H31O6, or their hydrates, whereinM is a monovalent metal or an ammonium group represented by the formula R4N , wherein each R is independently hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, at a temperature, pressure and time sufficient to form said oxirane compound and thereafter recovering said oxirane compound by conventional means. Suitable periodate compounds which can be employed herein as represented by the formulas above include, for example those compounds wherein M is lithium, sodium, potassi um, rubidium, cesium, silver and an ainmonium radical represented by the formula R4N wherein each R4 is independently hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyi, butyl, octyl and phenyl. Olefinically unsaturated materials which are epoxidized in accordance with the present invention include substituted and unsubstituted aliphatic and alicyclic olefins which may be hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, ketones or ethers. Preferred compounds are those having from about 2 to 30 carbon atoms, and preferably at least 3 carbon atoms. Illustrative olefins are ethylene, propylene, normal butylene, isobutylene, the pentenes, the methyl pentenes, the normal hexenes, the octenes, the dodecenes, cyclohexene, methyl cyclohexene, butadiene, styrene, methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, vinylcyclohexene and. the phenyl cyclohexenes. Olefins having halogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus and nitrogen substituents can be used.Such substituted olefins are illustrated by allyl alcohol, methallyl alcohol, cyclohexenol, diallyl ether, methyl methacrylate, methyl oleate, methyl vinyl ketone, allyl chloride, triallylphosphite, triallylphosphate and triallylamine. In general, all olefinic materials epoxidized by methods previously employed can be epoxidized in accordance with this process including olefinically unsaturated polymers having up to several thousand carbon atoms. Illustrative olefins are linseed oil, olive oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, tall oil glycerides, castor oil, corn oil, butyl polyglycol esters of unsaturated fatty acids, liquid or solid polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and unsaturated copolymers of ethylene and propylene, including terpolymers thereof with cyclopentadiene. The ratio of periodate compound to olefin is from about 1 1 to about 1 100, preferably from about 1 5 to about 1 20 moles of periodate mole of unsaturation. The tenperature employed in the present process can vary from 1000C up to 4000C. The particular temperature which may advantageously be employed depends upon the particular periodate used. A suitable teln pefrature can be easily determined in the laboratory by gradually raising the temperature of a mixture of the particular periodate and olefin until the corresponding oxirane compound is detected by the appropriate analytical method such as, for example, gas chromatography.In general, increasing the temperature beyond this point will increase the rate of formation of the oxirane compound. Another method is to heat. the particular periodate compound and observe that temperature at which significant quantities of oxygen are released. Suitable temperatures for some of the periodate compounds employed in oxidizing propylene are as follows Periodate Temperature, Compound C LiIO4 119 175 Li2H3IO6 129 135 NalO4 190 350 NaIO4 170 240 Na2H3IO6 180 214 KIO4 260 300 KIO4 221 285 RbIO4 271 280 Periodate Temperature, Compoulld C Cs 104 158 300 AglO4 165 350 Ag2H3 106 109 149 Bu4MIO4 123 140 Supported on Co3O4. The time of reaction is dependent upon the temperature and residence time of the olefin, usually from about 1 second to about 2 hours, but any length of time sufficient to provide a suitable conversion at the desired temperature can be employed. Pressures which can be employed range from subatmospheric pressure to superatmospheric pressure, but generally pressures from 1 psi absolute to 200 psig 0.07 to 14.1 kg r.m2 are satisfactory. The process is easily conducted by contacting the olefin with the periodate compound, either in the solid state or in solution. When the periodate compound is in a solution, the olefin can be bubbled through the solution of the periodate compound. When the periodate compound is in the solid state, the olefin can be passed through a bed of the solid material. The resultant oxidized products can be separated from the periodate compounds by any suitable means such as filtration, distillation or combinations thereof. The periodates can be employed in their natural form, e.g. crystalline solid or powder, and can be dissolved in suitable inert solvents or supported on suitable supports. Suitable solvents are those which dissolve the periodate, but which do not react with the periodate at an appreciable rate under the reaction conditions employed. These may include such polar and non polar solvents as water and aromatic and substituted aside types such .i, for example, benzene, biphenyl, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and mixtures thereof. suitable supports include inert inorganic solids czech as, for example, alumina, silica, silicon carbide molecular sieves, zirconia, cobaltous and cobaltic oxides including cobalto cobaltic oxide, Co304 , ceric oxide CeO2 and Fullers earth. If desired, the olefins may be diluted with an inert material before coming into contact with the periodate. Suitable such inert materials include, for example, the well known inert gases such as nitrogen, helium and argon. The periodate compounds if not commercially available can be prepared by the addition of a suitable metal hydroxide to periodic acid H5IO6 in mole ratio of acid to hydroxide of from about 1 1 to about 2 i. The periodate compounds can be prepared by the methods disclosed in Analytical Applications ofPeriodic Acid and Iodic Acid and Their Salts by G.Frederick Smith, 5th Ed. published by The G. FrederickSmith Chemical Co., Columbus Ohio, 1950, Chapter II. Other ways of preparing the alkali metal periodate include the reaction of the metal iodide or iodate with C12 or Br2 in the presence of MOH. The periodate can be prepared by the oxidation of the iodate to a periodate with R2S208, in the presence of MOH. In the process for making epoxides frorn olefins and periodates, the periodates are converted to iodates.These iodates can then be converted to periodates by contacting the iodates with oxygen or an oxygen source such as air at temperatures of from about 1500C to about 4300C and as high as 8000C until the desired periodate is formed. The desired oxirane compound can be separated from the other reaction products by any convenient means such as distillation, extraction, or combinations thereof.Preparing Alkali Metal Mono and Dibasic AlkaliMetal Periodates from Tribasic, Tetrabasic andPentabasic Alkali Metal Periodates Monobasic alkali metal periodates have been prepared by reacting tribasic alkali metal periodates with a strong mineral acid such as sulfuric acid or nitric acid.Such strong acids result in neutral by products such as alkali metal nitrates or alkali metal sulfates. The process of the present invention results in by products such as alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates or dilute caustic solutions which can be recovered and employed, if desired, in other processes such as, for example, precipitating magnesium hydroxide from seawater and neutralizing acidic process streams. The present invention resides in a process for preparing an alkali metal monobasic, dibasic periodate or mixtures thereof, characterized by contacting an alkali metal tribasic, tetrabasic, pentabasic periodate or mixture thereof with a substance having a relative acidic value, pRa, of from 3 to 16 at a temperature of from OOC to about 3500C and a pressure of from 1 atmosphere to 100 atmospheres for a time sufficient to form said alkali metal monobasic, dibasic periodate or mixtures thereof and wherein the molar ratio of periodate said substance is from 1 1 to 1 10Q0. Suitable tribasic alkali metal periodates which can be employed in the process of the present invention include, for example, K3H2IO6, Na3H2IO6, Li3H2IO6, Cs3H2IO6, Rb3H2I2O10, Na3IO5, Cs3IO5 and mixtures thereof. Suitable pentabasic alkali metal periodates which can be employed in the process of the present invention include, for example, Na5IO6, K51O6, Li5IO6, Rb5IO6, Cos it and mixtures thereof. Suitable weakly acidic substances havingv relative acidic values, pRa, cf 3 to 16 which can be employed in the process of the present invention include, for example, H2O, CO2, H2CO3, Na2Cr207, K2Cr2O7, WO3, NaHCO3, B203, H3BO4 and mixtures thereof. The following examples illustrate the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 A feed gas containing propylene with or without nitrogen as an inert diluent was passed through a glass tube in which five grams of solid potassium metaperiodate, KIO4, was suspended on glass wool. The tube was heated and the effluent gas stream was analyzed by gas chromatography for the oxidation products. Tile products of the reaction were later verified by a combination of mass spectroscopy and gas chrornatography. Periodic tests were made for carbon dioxide formation by bubbling the effluent through a saturated aqueous solution of calcium oxide. The results are given in the following Table I.

A 0.3 yield of propylene oxide was observed at 165 C and was found to have increased to 5 at 3500C.This example illustrates that direct oxidation in the presence of a periodate confound salts in negligible formation of the desired oxilane. EXAMPLE 2 3 Grams of sold KIO4 were finely ground and sprinkled onto a glass wool pad which was then rolled up and placed in a glass reaction tube in a tube furnace. The effluent was connected to a gas chromatograph through a gas sample valve. The reactor was purged with ethylene, the flow rate was established at 10 cc min. and the temperature slowly raised. .Periodic samples of the effluent were taken to identify the oxidation products which were formed. At 2800C, 60 of the oxidation product was found to be ethylene oxide with the remaining 40 being acetaldehyde. A similar experiment in which NaIO4 was used also produced ethylene oxide as the major oxidation product.EXAMPLE 3 5 Grams of finely powdered NaIO4 were placed in the reaction tube described in the previous example.A stream of nitrogen was bubbled through a container of allyl alcohol immediately before the vapors entered the top of the reaction tube. The effluent from the lower end of the reactor was passed through a carbon tetrachloride scrubber at 0 C to remove the oxidation products. The reactor was heated from room temperature to 2400 C. Analysis of the trap at this time showed that glycidol had been produced from the reaction of allyl alcohol and sodium metaperiodate.EXAMPLE 4 The reaction between NalO4 and propylene under pressure was studied by placing approximately 1 g. of NalO4 in a 12 x 3 8 30.5 cm x 0.95 cm stainless steel tube. The pressures and flow rates were selected by adjustment of a regulator in the propylene line and a needle valve attached to the outlet of the reactor.The temperature of the reactor was controlled by placing it in a molten nitrate salt bath at 2250C. Analysis of the effluent was made by gas chromatography. Propylene at 15.0 psig 1.06 kg cm2 and an exit rate of 50 cc min.gave a selectivity to propylene oxide of greater than 90 based on the resulting organic oxidation products.When the pressure was increased to 29.5 psig 2.08 kg cmê and the flow rate reduced to 20 cc min., the selectivity to propylene oxide was found to also be in excess of 90 . EXAMPLE 5 2 Grams of the periodate being evaluated were placed in a glass tube reactor between glass wool plugs.The propylene flow was adjusted to either 15 cc min. or 5.4 cc min. The reactor was placed in a molten salt bath at 2000C and the temperature slowly increased until gas chromatographic analysis of the effluent showed that oxidation of the propylene was taking place. The results are given in the following Table II. TABLE II Selectivity Residence C3H6 PropionalRun Temp.

The flow of propylene was adjusted to 50 cc min. and the reactor immersed in a molten salt bath at 150 C.The temperature was raised to 175 C, at which point gas chromatographic analysis of the effluent showed the organic oxidation products to be 92 propylene oxide and 8 acetone.EXAMPLE 7 Nitrogen was bubbled through cyclohexene and was then allowed to pass into a reactor containingNa2H3IO6. As the temperature was increased, the effluent streem was analyzed by gas chromatography for the oration of oxidation products. At about 2000C, 18 of the cyclohexene in the feed gas was found to be converted to cyclohexene oxide. EXAMPLE 8 When propylene was bubbled through a solution of tetrabutylammonium periodate in biphenyl at atmospheric pressure, gas chromatographic analysis of the effluent sbowed the oxidation of propylene to propylene oxide would proceed with better than 95 selectivity at a reacti.on temperature between 120 C and 1400C.EXAMPLE 9 When LiIO4 2.6H2O or LiH4IO6 0.6H2O was dissolved in either dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide and propylene bubbled through the solutions, propylene oxide was found to be formed at reaction temperatures between 125 C and 1400 C. EXAMPLE 10 A 10 gram sample of NalO4 was placed in a glass U tube reactor. The nitrogen feed to the reactor was bubbled through a second U tube, filled with styrene at 730C, immediately before it entered the reactor. As the reactor was heated from 2000C to 2400C, the effluent was scrubbed through Åa toluene filled trap at about OOC. Analysis of this trap at the conclusion of the reaction showed styrene oxide to be the major redaction prcauct. EXAMPLE 11 Trans 2 butene was passed through a glassU tube containing 3.0 grams of NAIL4 at a rate of approximately 15 cc min. The effluent was scrubbed through a water filled trap which was cooled in an ice bath. Trans 2,3 epoxybutane was the major product observed in the water trap as the reactor was heated from 2lO0C to 2450 C. In a similar experiment using cis 2 butene as the olefin, cis 2,3 epoxybutane was the major product observed in the water trap at a reaction temperature of 2200C.EXAMPLE 12 One gram of Li5 106 was suspended in 50 cc of water and placed in an autoclave. After charging with 200 psig 14.1 kg cmê of CO2 the autoclave and contents were heated to 1300C for 6 hours. When cool, a clear, colorless solution was removed and analyzed for perio 7 date 86 of the I charge remained . The solution pH of 7.3 combined with the H51O6 LiOH titration curve indicates the periodate exists as a mixture of the mono and dibasic salts. In the lithium series of periodate salts, only the mono and dibasic salts are water soluble. Thus, a clear solution alone indicates reduction to a mono or dibasic salt. EXAMPLE 13 5.8 Grams of Na3H2IO6 were placed in 200 ml of water and CO2 was bubbled through the suspension.After 15 to 20 minutes, a clear solution was obtained at pH 11. As the CO2 purge was continued 300 to 400 grams over 2 to 3 hours , a white precipitate formed.The final solution had a pH of i.5 and yielded 2.5 grams of solids upon filtration. The infrared spectrum of this material indicated it was Na2H3IO6.EXAMPLE 14 A sample of commercial Na3H2 106 which failed to produce 1,2 propylene oxide from propylene below 4000C was ground with one half an equal molar amount of sodium dichromate in a mortar and pestle. 3 Grams of the dried powdered mixture was then placed in a 1 inch 2.54 cm i.d. glass reactor and heated under a propylene flow of 15 cc per minute. Propylene oxide was produced with good selectivity between 1800C and 2450C which indicated conversion of the tribasic periodate to mono and or dibasic periodate. EXAMPLE 15 Mixtures of commercial Na3H2IO6 5.9 grams, 0.02 mole with an equimolar amount of WO3, NaHCO3, B203 or a two fold molar amount of H3BO3 were separately slurried with water, dried in a vacuum oven and ground to a fine powder. Each of these mixtures was found to produce propylene oxide when propylene was passed over them at 2500C and 20 cc per minute in a 1 inch 2.54 cm i.d. glass reactor.
