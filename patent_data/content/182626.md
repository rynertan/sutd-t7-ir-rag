## Description
This invention relates to cyclic peptides which have vasopressin VSP antagonist activity. More specifically, these new chemical compounds have VSP or OXT like structures which are characterized by 1 the lack of a prolyl unit at position 7 and 2 an acyclic β mercaptopropionic acid residue at position 1. Representative compounds of this new generic group have demonstrated weak V₂ antagonistic activity while maintaining V₁ antagonistic activity in good degree. A number of synthetic modifications of the vasopressin and oxytocin structures have been reported to give antagonistic activities. Such structures contain units which are derived from β mercapto β,β dialkylpropionic acid, for example, deamino penicillanic acid or β mercaptopropionic acid, substituted for the cysteine unit at position 1 of the structure of the natural product J. Lowridge et al., J. Med. Chem. Ferring, A.B., European Patent No. 112,809 A, discloses that certain oxytocin compounds with Mpr at position 1 have anti OXT activity. Later studies by M. Manning et al., J. Med. Chem. In the description herein and in the claims, the nomenclature common in the art of peptide and, more specifically, vasopressin chemistry is used. When no configuration is noted, the amino acid unit is in the L, or naturally occuring, form. The thio members of the β mercaptopropionic acid 1 and cysteine 6 units are added for clarity in certain structural formulas. Exemplary of the peptide art designations used herein are the following dPen, β mercapto β β dimethylpropionic acid Mpr, β mercaptopropionic acid Thr, threonine Orn, ornithine OXT, oxytocin Abu, α aminobutyric acid Chg, cyclohexylglycine Cha, cyclohexylalanine Pba, The des Pro vasopressin like compounds of the invention are illustrated by the following structural formula Alk in formula 1 and hereafter represents a lower alkyl of 1 4 carbons which may be a substituent which is optionally attached either to the amide nitrogen at A, to a phenyl of an amino acid unit such as Phe at positions 2 or 3 or to the oxygen substituent such as that of a tyrosine unit when the latter is present at positions 2 or 3. Such alkyl substituents include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or butyl. Preferably, Alk is methyl or ethyl. Bzl represents benzyl. When the term, vasopressin or VSP , is used, it means L arginine vasopressin AVP unless otherwise modified to indicate a D arginine, leucine, homoarginine, lysine or ornithine containing vasopressin. Certain antagonists which have structures related to oxytocin OXT are also included in this invention. In the compounds represented by formula I, those with structures having dPen at position 1, a L unit at 2 and an arginine at 7 are preferred for selective VSP V₁ antagonism, which is manifested by vasodilation. The β mercaptopropionic acid unit at position 1, Mpa¹, includes the β,β dimethyl congener as well as the β methyl congener in the form of one of its separated isomers or a mixture of isomers. A subgeneric group of compounds of this invention comprises compounds of formula I in which P is Phe, X is Tyr or Tyr Alk Y is Ile or Gln A is GlyNH₂ or NH₂ each R is methyl and Z is Arg, Harg, D Arg, Orn or Leu. Also included in this invention are various derivatives of the compounds of formula I such as addition salts, prodrugs in ester or amide form and complexes. The addition salts may be either salts with pharmaceutically acceptable cations such as NH, Ca, K Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds of formula I which degrade to the parent compound in vivo. The ester prodrug forms are, for example, lower alkyl esters of the acids of formula I which have from 1 8 carbons in the alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6 12 carbons in the aralkyl radical such as various benzyl esters. Other latentiated derivatives of the compounds of formula I will be obvious to those skilled in the art. Complexes include various solvates, such as hydrates or alcoholates, or those with supporting resins, such as a Merrifield resin. The compounds of formula I are prepared by cyclizing a linear peptide intermediate of this invention by means of the two mercapto groups located, respectively, in the cysteine unit at position 6 and in the β mercaptopropionic acid unit at position 1. The cyclization reaction occurs in the presence of a mild oxidizing agent which, at high dilution, is capable of oxidizing intramolecularly the dimercaptan to a disulfide. Oxidation of the following linear peptide Other mild oxidation agents having an oxidation potential roughly equivalent to ferricyanide may also be used for the ring closure reaction. Oxygen or iodine are alternatives. Of course, one skilled in the art will recognize that certain cyclization methods are not appropriate if an interfering reaction site is present in the structure of the starting material of formula II. The linear mercaptan starting material may or may not have protecting groups common the art present at the various amino acid units or at the mercapto positions. In the former case, the protecting groups are removed after cyclization. In the case of the ACM SH protecting groups, removal of the protective group and cyclization may both be accomplished using iodine in aqueous methanol. Usually, however, the free linear peptide is cyclized. The desired cyclic des proline peptides of formula I are conveniently isolated by acidifying the aqueous oxidation mixture, such as using glacial acetic acid, and passing the reaction mixture over an ion exchange chromatographic column, for example, over a weakly acid, acrylic resin column with acid elution, or by gel filtration over a bead formed gel prepared by cross linking dextran with epichlorohydrin. Often, the acetate salt is isolated by this method. In an alternative reaction sequence for preparing the compounds of this invention, the intermediate of formula II in which one or both tail units is missing is cyclized as described above. The cyclized product is, then, condensed in one or two optional reactions with the protected amino acid or dipeptide units, which are defined as Z and A for formula I, to extend the tail portion of the structure. Reaction conditions for such tail unit attachment are those of any amide producing method known to the peptide art as described herein. Particularly, reaction of the tail amino acids, whose carboxylic acid group is protected as described, with the 6 Cys acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and HBT is used. The protecting groups which may be present on the cyclic Cys acid or the tail units are then removed to give the products of this invention. Reaction conditions should be selected to minimize racemization of the Cys unit as known to the art. The important intermediates of formula II, in free or protected form are conveniently prepared using solid phase methods of peptide synthesis as discussed in M. Manning et al., J. Med. Chem. The peptide chain of the linear peptides of formula II is built up, stepwise, proceeding from unit 7 or 8 working toward the characterizing unit 1. Each unit is properly protected as known in the peptide art and as described below. The sequence of step reactions is conveniently carried out in a Beckman 990 B peptide synthesizer without isolation of each intermediate peptide. The details of the overall synthetic procedure are in the working examples presented hereinafter. The various amino acids, which are consecutively added to the resin supported chain are protected as known to the art. For example, the Boc protecting group is used for an amino group especially at the The protected linear peptide intermediate is split from the carrying resin matrix, for example, by using ammonia in an aqueous miscible solvent, and, then, is treated to remove the protective groups, such as by using sodium liquid ammonia. This procedure gives the amide derivative of the linear hepta or octapeptide. More conveniently, the two steps are combined by treating the resin supported peptide with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride using a suitable carbonium ion scavenger, such as anisole, to give the des proline dPen¹ or Mpr¹ peptide intermediate of formula II in good yield. The compounds of this invention have potent V₁ V₂ vasopressin antagonist activity with a shift toward the V₁ receptors. Vasopressin is primarily known to contribute to the anti diuretic mechanism of action within the kidney. When the action of these compounds antagonizes that of the natural anti diuretic hormone ADH , the body excretes water due to an increased permeability of the terminal portions of the renal tubule. This mechanism of action is at the vasopressin receptors V₂ receptors located on the plasma membrane of certain renal epithelial cells. Any patient suffering from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion SIADH or from an undesirable edematous condition is a target for compounds which have substantial V₂ antagonist activity. Examples of clinical conditions indicated for such compounds include hypertension, hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure or a component of any traumatic condition resulting from serious injury or disease. The second group of vasopressin receptors, which are more important targets of this invention, are those affecting the smooth muscle tissues of the blood vessels or of the uterus. Vasopressin or oxytocin are natural stimulants of these effectors which result in pressor effects on the cardiovascular system and stimulation of the uterus, respectively. These receptors are called generically V₁ receptors for the purposes of this disclosure. The compounds of the present invention antagonize the activity of vasopressin and oxytocin at their receptor sites discussed above. The compounds of the present invention are, therefore, antagonists at V₁ receptor sites. In fact, the V₁ V₂ ratio of activities of the compounds of this invention is shifted to give potent V₁ antagonism with very weak V₂ antagonism. Especially active V₁ antagonists are the des Pro dPen compounds of formula I in which X is a tyrosyl residue and Y is a glutamine residue. These compounds, therefore, have selective vasodilation activity which is of benefit in dilating arterial systems in which vasopressin is a mediator. The pharmacological activity is manifested in treating hypertension, shock or cardiac insufficiency. They are used in conjunction with ACE inhibitors, α blockers or β blockers. The compounds of formula I which have amino acid units other than at position 1 which resemble those of oxytocin have especially potent anti oxytocic activity. Therefore, such compounds are particularly useful to relax uterine tissues or dry up milk production. Exemplary of such compounds are the des Pro Mpr compounds of formula I in which Z is arginine or ornithine X is a The compounds of this invention, therefore, are mainly used to induce selective vasodilation as noted above or to induce antioxytocic activity in patients in need of such antagonist treatment by administration internally, particularly parenterally or by insufflation, to said patients. A nontoxic but effective quantity of the chosen compound is preferably combined with a pharmaceutical carrier. Dosage units contain a nontoxic, effective quantity of the active ingredient selected from the range 0.05 50 mcg kg, preferably 1 15 mcg kg, based on a 70 kg patient. The dosage units are administered from 1 to 5 times daily or by continuous intravenous drip. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, which contain an active ingredient of formula I, comprise a dosage unit quantity as described above dissolved or suspended in a standard liquid carrier. Such a carrier is isotonic saline. The composition is often used in an ampoule or a multiple dose vial suitable for parenteral injection, such as for intravenous, subcutaneous or intra muscular administration. A composition for insufflation may be similar but is often administered in a metered dose applicator or inhaler. Pulverized powder compositions may be used along with oily preparations, gels, buffers for isotonic preparations, emulsions or aerosols. Antagonistic activity at the V₁ vasopressin receptors is determined in a protocol which measures the reversal of the vasopressin induced contraction of rat thoracic aorta tissue. This is expressed as K The data in Table 1 demonstrate a shift to potent V₁ and OXT antagonistic activity from the potent V₂ receptor antagonism represented by a representative Pmp¹ compound. Some V₂ antagonism is however still demonstrated by the compounds of this invention. The following examples are intended solely to teach the preparation of the compounds of this invention. All temperatures are in degrees Centigrade. For the solid phase synthesis of the titled resin supported peptides, a 7 or 8 position unit resin material, for example, Boc. Arg Tos BHA resin 1.00 mmol g of resin , was used as a starting material. It was prepared by reacting Boc Amino Acid Tos if necessary , 3 mmol, with the benzhydrylamine resin, 1.0 mmol, in dimethylformamide for two hours. The benzhydrylamine resin as a free base was swelled in methylene chloride overnight. It was washed once with 7 diisopropylethylamine DIEA in methylene chloride, then 6x1 min. with methylene chloride, and finally 2x1 min. with predried dimethylformamide. The loading of BOC amino acid on the resin was carried out twice on the shaker using 1 hydroxybenzotriazole HBT, 6 mmol , and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC, 3 mmol . A quantitative ninhydrin test and amino acid analysis were performed routinely after loading to determine the percentage loading on the resin. The appropriately protected amino acids were coupled sequentially on the Boc amino acid resin using the Beckman peptide synthesizer 990 B or a shaker. The program used for each coupling, except Boc Asn and Mpa 4 MeBzl , was as follows In case of coupling of Asn moiety, 1 hydroxybenzotriazole HBT, 6 mmol was used, 10 ml of 0.6 M in dimethylformamide. Dry dimethylformamide was also used as solvent when Mpa 4 MeBzl was coupled onto the peptide resin, using 4 dimethylaminopyridine DAP, 3 mmol . Completion of each coupling reaction was monitored by the ninhydrin test. The The benzhydrylamine resin was analyzed by nitrogen analysis to fall within 0.72 1.03 mmol per 1 gram. Each protected amino acid unit was purchased from commercial sources or synthesized by known procedures. Successful coupling incorporated 0.4 to 0.732 mmole per gram of the first amino acid.

The solution is filtered under sterile conditions into a 2 ml ampoule and lyophylized. The powder is reconstituted before either intramuscular or intravenous injection to a subject suffering from hypertesion or shock susceptible to anti ADH mechanism of action. The injection is repeated as necessary, from 1 5 times daily or in continuous i.v. drug injection. Other desPropeptides of this invention are made up and used in like manner. 20 Milligrams of finely ground desPropeptide of this invention such as the product of Example 2 is suspended in a mixture of 75 mg of benzyl alcohol and 1.395 g of a suspending agent such as a commercial mixture of semi synthetic glycerides of higher fatty acids. The suspension is placed in an aerosol 10 ml container which is closed with a metering valve and charged with aerosol propellants. The contents comprise 100 unit doses which are administered intranasally to an edematous subject from 1 6 times a day.
