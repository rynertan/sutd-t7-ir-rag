## Description
The present invention relates to a sublimation transfer printer according to the first part of claim 1 and a calibration print making device incorporating said printer. US A 4 060 829 discloses a method of color correction in a plate making process comprising the steps of compressing color separation density signals relating to R red , G green and B blue , converting the signals into signals corresponding to Y yellow , M magenta and C cyan , these signals having digital format, correcting the C , M and Y signals for deviations in color introduced by the color inks used and converting these corrected signals to analog signals. A method of making a hard copy of a color image is generally classified into the ink jet system and the thermal transfer system. The thermal transfer system includes the system of effecting thermal recording using a sublimation type thermosensitive transfer paper and the system of effecting thermal recording using a wax type thermosensitive transfer paper. Among these systems, the system using a sublimation type thermosensitive transfer paper can obtain a clear or distinct image as compared with other systems. Accordingly, it can be said that such a sublimatiton type thermal recording system is most suitable for making a high quality color hard copy. On the other hand, for color image to be applied as the hard copy, there are various pictorial images e.g. a video image, a computer graphic image, a pictorial image, a photographic image and a print image, etc. It is possible to make hard copies of these various pictorial images on the basis of the system using the above mentioned sublimation type thermosensitive transfer paper. Such a hard copy is made as follows. First is to make data indicative of three primary colors which will be simply referred to as three primary color data hereinafter of the above mentioned various pictorial images to input this three original color data to a sublimation transfer printer in which the above said sublimation type thermosensitive transfer paper is used. The sublimation transfer printer drives a thermal head on the basis of the input pictorial image data to sublimation transfer dye contained in a transfer layer of a sublimation transfer sheet onto an image receiving paper per each color, thus to form a color image on the image receiving paper. Method for inputting the three primary color data of the various pictorial images to the sublimation transfer printer is easily carried out, although they are different depending upon the kind of pictorial images. Namely, in the case of a computer graphic image, since the image is formed with three primary color data comprising R, G and B, it is possible to employ a method of directly inputting the three primary color data of R, G and B to the sublimation transfer printer. In the case of a video image, it is possible to employ a method to convert video signals forming the image into three primary color data of R, G and B or Y, M and C to input the three primary data to the sublimation transfer printer. Further, in the case of a pictorial image, a photographic image, or a print image, etc., it is possible to employ a method to read an image using a television camera or a scanner, etc. to input the image data thus read to the sublimation transfer printer directly or after conversion processing is applied to the image data to convert it into the three primary color data. However, as stated above, when there is employed the method to input the three primary color data of various pictorial images to the sublimation transfer printer to simply drive a thermal head in accordance with the input data, only a poor quality image considerably different from an actual image can be obtained, thus failing to make a high precision and high quality color hard copy. With the above in view, an object of the present invention is to provide a sublimation transfer printer and a calibration print making device which can extremely efficiently make a high precision and high quality color hard copy from various pictorial images. To achieve this object, the present invention provides a sublimation transfer printer according to claim 1 and a calibration print making device according to claim 2. The present invention will be described in connection with preferred embodiments according to the present invention with reference to attached drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a sublimation transfer printer according to the present invention. As shown in this figure, the sublimation transfer printer the entirety of which is designated at 1 is provided with a printer mechanism comprising a transfer drum 17 rotatably disposed with a transfer head 16 being in contact with the transfer drum 17 through a transfer film W. The sublimation transfer printer 1 comprises a pixel density converter 3 connected at its input side to a pictorial image input unit 2 provided outside of the printer 1, a color corrector 4 connected at its input side to the pixel density converter 3, a gradation corrector 10 connected at its input side to the color collector 4, and a storage unit 11 connected at its input side to the gradation corrector 10. The storage unit 11 is provided at its output side with a select switch 12. To the select switch 12, a buffer 13 is connected. By operating the select switch 12, a desired data stored in the storage unit 11 is written into the buffer 13. To the output side of the buffer 13, a parallel to serial P S converter 14 for converting parallel data into serial data is connected. Further, to the output side of the P S converter 14, a driver 15 for driving the transfer head 16 constituting the transfer mechanism is connected. The pictorial image input device 2 has a function to input three primary data of R, G and B or Y, M and C of the original pictorial image to the sublimation transfer printer 1. In accordance with kind of pictorial image, a suitable one of various pictorial image input devices can be selected. For instance, where the original pictorial image is a computer graphic, since the image is formed with the three primary color data, the image input device 2 is a computer itself forming the pictorial image. Further, where the original pictorial image is a video image formed with a video signal, since it is necessary to convert a video signal into R, G and B signals, the pictorial image input device 2 comprises a VTR and an RGB decoder, etc. In addition, where the original image is a pictorial image, a photography or a printed matter, etc., since it is necessary to read the original image to form an image signal, the pictorial image input device 2 is comprised of a television camera or a scanner, etc. The pixel density converter 3 has a function to convert pixel density picture data input from the image input device 2 into a predetermined pixel density to apply thinning or interpolation to the picture data per each color. For obtaining a high quality color hard copy, it is preferable to convert the pixel density into a pixel density of 10 lines mm. The color corrector 4 has a function to correct the three primary data converted into a predetermined pixel density in conformity with the characteristic of a transfer ink of the transfer film W, and a function to create ink data. Fig. 2 is a block diagram schematically illustrating an example of the color corrector 4. As shown in this figure, the color corrector 4 comprises addresses 6Y, 6M and 6C, a black data calculating circuit 7, a primary color correction circuit 8 and a secondary color correction circuit 9. The primary color correction circuit 8 functions to make a muddiness correction of the transfer ink. The secondary color correction circuit 9 functions to enable a conscious color control based on a selective correction with respect to a predetermined hue. The gradation corrector 10 has a function to correct gradation of data of each color Y, M, C and K black input from the color corrector 4 according to need. The gradation corrector 10 is provided with a gradation circuit not shown , etc., enabling emphasis of high light or shadow. The storage unit 12 temporarily stores data per each color output from the gradation corrector 10. By operating the select switch 12 provided at the output side of the storage unit 11, data per each color can be written into the buffer 13. Into the buffer 13 employed in this embodiment, data corresponding to one line of the transfer head 16 can be written. As previously described, the buffer 13 is connected to the P S converter 14. Fig. 3 is a block diagram schematically illustrating the circuit arrangement of the P S converter 14. As shown in this figure, the P S converter 14 includes a comparator 22 to which two inputs labeled A and B are delivered from the buffer 13 and a counter 23, respectively. More particularly, the input A is pixel data of 8 bit configuration A₀ to A₇ delivered from the buffer 13 as parallel data. On the other hand, the input B is an input of 8 bit configuration B₀ to B₇ delivered from the counter 23 as parallel data. The comparator 22 responds to these inputs A and B to output serial data to the driver 15 Fig. 1 , thus allowing the driver 15 to drive the transfer head 16 Fig. 1 on the basis of the serial data. Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram showing the detail of the transfer head 16. As shown in this figure, a shift register SR operates in response to serial data delivered thereto to produce parallel outputs. These parallel outputs are latched by a latch circuit LT. The latched outputs are delivered to one input terminals of NAND gates NA, respectively. When a strobe signal is input to respective the other input terminals of the NAND gates NA, the above mentioned latched outputs are delivered to heat elements HE, respectively. Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate a transfer mechanism comprising the transfer head 16 and the transfer drum 17 wherein an image is transferred onto an image receiving paper using the transfer mechanism. Onto the peripheral surface of the transfer drum 17, an image receiving paper P is wound. The transfer head 16 is in contact with a predetermined position of the transfer drum 17 through the transfer film W, thereby to heat and sublime dye of the transfer film W to adhere it onto the image receiving paper P. Fig. 7, which is a partial enlarged view of Fig. 6, shows that the transfer head 16 is in contact with the transfer drum 17 through the transfer film W and the image receiving paper P. The transfer film W comprises a heat resisting layer 31, a base material 32 and a transfer layer 33 which are stacked in succession. On the other hand, the image receiving paper P comprises an image receiving layer 34 and a base material 35 stacked thereon. For the heat resisting layer of the transfer film W, there have been proposed a method of providing a metallic layer or a silicon oxide layer as an antiwearing layer on the back surface of a base Japanese patent publications Tokkaisho No. 54 143152 and Tokkaisho No. 57 74195 , a method of providing a heat resisting resin layer such as silicon or epoxy Japanese patent publication Tokkaisho No. 57 7467 , a method of providing a resin layer to which a surface activating agent of solid or semi solid at an ordinary temperature is added Japanese patent publication Tokkaisho No. 57 12978 , or a method of providing a layer formed by containing a lubricating non organic pigment in a heat resisting resin. For the base material 32, a film e.g. a polyester film, a polystyrene film, a polysulfon film, a polyvinyl alcohol film or a cellophane, etc. may be used. Particularly, from a viewpoint of heat resisting property, a polyester film is preferable. It is desirable that its thickness is 0.5 to 50 µm, preferably 3 to 10 µm. The thermal transfer layer 33 is configured as a thermal sublimation transfer layer in which a dye having sublimation property is contained in a binder resin. It is desirable that its thickness is 0.2 to 5.0 µm, preferably 0.4 to 2.0 µm. It is desirable to use a dispersion dye as the dye contained in the transfer layer 33. Further, it is desirable that the dispersion dye has a molecular weight of about 150 to 400. Such a dye is selected by taking into account thermal sublimation temperature, hue, a weather worthiness, stability in a binder resin, and the like. For example, available dyes are Miketon Polyester Yellow YL C. I. Disperse Yellow 42 by Mitsui Tohsho Co., Ltd. , Kayaset Yellow G C. I. Disperse Yellow 77 by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. , PTY 52 C. I. Solvent Yellow 14 1 by Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Ltd. , Miketon Polyester Red B SF C.I. Disperse Red 111 by Mitsui Tohsho Co., Ltd. , Kayaset Red B C. I. Disperse Red B by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. , PTR 54 C. I. Disperse Red 50 by Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Ltd. , Miketon Polyester Blue FBL C. I. Disperse Blue 56 by Mitsui Tohsho Co., Ltd. , PTB 67 C. I. Disperse Blue 241 by Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Ltd. , and Kayaset Blue 906 C. I. Solvent 112 by Nippon Kasei Co., Ltd. , etc. Dye exists ordinarily by 5 to 70 weight percent, preferably by 10 to 60 weight percent in a transfer layer, although depending upon sublimation of the dye and the magnitude of covering force in a colored condition. For the binder resin, materials which ordinarily have high heat resisting property and do not prevent transfer of the dye when heated are selected. For instance, such materials are listed below. For providing such a thermal transfer layer 33 on the base material 32, a method is employed to dilute dye and binder resin into a solvent or dilute binder resin with dye being dispersed to produce an ink composite for forming sublimation transfer layer to provide the ink composite material on the base material 32 using a suitable printing method or a painting method. According to need, an arbitrary additive may be added to the ink composite for forming sublimation transfer layer. On the other hand, for the image receiving paper P, paper, synthetic paper, woven cloth, unwoven cloth, plastic film or sheet, compound material in which plastic film, paper and metallic foil are arbitrarily combined, or metallic plate or wood may be suitably selected according to use. The image receiving paper P shown in Fig. 7 is of structure comprising the image receiving layer 34 provided on the base material 35. However, the image receiving paper P may be formed with only the base material 34. The image receiving layer 34 may be provided according to need. In addition, available resins constituting the image receiving layer are listed below. In addition to the above mentioned synthetic resins, mixture or copolymer thereof may be used. Then, the operation of the sublimation transfer printer 1 shown in Fig. 1 will be described. When three primary color data of an original image are input from the pictorial image input device 2 to the pixel density converter 3, the pixel density converter 3 converts the three primary color data into data having a predetermined pixel density to input the data thus obtained to the color corrector 4. In this instance, the three primary color data represented by density signals are input to the color corrector 4. In this embodiment, data YO of yellow, data MO of magenta and data CO of cyan are input. The data YO, MO and CO input to the color corrector 4 are input to the black data calculating circuit 7 through adders 6Y, 6M and 6C as shown in Fig. 2. In this black data calculating circuit 7, black data K is calculated using the expression On the other hand, the data YO, MO and CO from the pixel density converter 3 is input to the primary color correction circuit 8. Thus, primary correction data Y1, M1 and C1 are calculated. Then, these primary correction data Y1, M1 and C1 are input to the secondary correction circuit 9. Thus, secondary correction data Y2, M2 and C2 are calculated. Then, these secondary correction data Y2, M2 and C2 are delivered to the adders 6Y, 6M and 6C. Thus, they are added to corresponding data YO, MO and CO, respectively, thereby to produce data Y, M and C. After the black data K is calculated by the black data calculating circuit 7, the above mentioned data Y, M and C are input to the gradation corrector 10. The primary color correction circuit 8 functions to calculate primary correction data Y1, M1 and C1 necessary for muddiness correction of the transfer ink. The primary color correction circuit 8 applies matrix operation expressed by the following equations to the original data YO, MO and CO to calculate primary correction data Y1, M1 and C1, To enable the conscious color control based on a selective correction with respect to a particular hue, the secondary color correction circuit 9 functions to calculate the secondary correction data Y2, M2 and C2. By applying matrix operation to the primary correction data as indicated by the following equations, the secondary correction data Y2, M2 and C2 are calculated. Accordingly, by adding the secondary correction data Y2, M2 and C2 to the original data YO, MO and CO in the adders 6Y, 6M and 6C, respectively, and selecting the weighting coefficient K In addition, an operation may be applied to the black data K to calculate the correction data K2 using the following equation to add the correction data K2 thus calculated to the black data K, thus enabling correction of the black data K, Thus, the data Y, M, C and K output from the color corrector 4 are input to the gradation corrector 10 and then undergo correction of the gradation per each data thereat. Fig. 8 is a view for explaining gradation correction carried out in the gradation corrector 10 wherein f0 represents a standard characteristic curve, f1 a high light emphasis curve, f2 a shadow emphasis curve, f3 a high light shadow emphasis curve and f4 an intermediate emphasis curve. As shown in this figure, by setting a tone reproduction characteristic for determining the relationship between density of color data and density of a printed material printed by the sublimation transfer printer 1 according to need, it is possible to reproduce tone similar to the original image. Namely, when no correction is made, the curve f0 is used. Further, when correction is made, an arbitrary one of curves f1 to f4 is suitably used in accordance with a portion to be emphasized. In addition, the tone reproduction characteristic curve is not limited to the curves shown. The gradation correction based on this tone reproduction characteristic is controlled by a gradation circuit not shown . By adjusting trimmers not shown individually provided in regard of high light, intermediate tone and shadow, the tone reproduction characteristic is set. Then, data of Y, M, C and K corrected by the gradation corrector 10 are temporarily stored in the storage unit 11. The data stored in the storage unit 11 are read per each color using the select switch 12. After the data thus read are stored in the buffer 13 per each line of the transfer head 16, they are input to the P S converter 14 as parallel data, with which they are converted into serial data. The serial data thus obtained from the parallel data corresponding to n pixels is delivered to the shift register SR shown in Fig. 4. These pixel data are latched by the latched circuit LT and then are input to the NAND gates NA. When the strobe signal ST is input to the NAND gates, these pixel data are delivered to the heat elements HE, respectively. Fig. 9 is an explanatory view showing signals per each pixel. The example shown indicates that the first pixel represents maximum gradation, the n th pixel minimum gradation, and the second to the n 1 th pixel gradation linearly changing. Then, the operation of the P S converter 14 will be described. As shown in Fig. 3, the pixel data A as the parallel data parallel data of 8 bits labeled A0 to A7 are delivered to the one input terminal of the comparator 22. To the other input terminal of the comparator 22, an output B increment outputs of 8 bits labeled B0 to B7 is delivered. The counter 23 effects incremental count of a clock to sequentially vary outputs B0 to B7. The comparator 22 makes a comparison between two inputs A and B, it continuously produces an output of logical 1 until the incremental output B of the counter 13 is equal to the pixel data A, i.e. when This serial data is produced as In a manner stated above, by incrementing the output B of the counter 23 by one, it is possible to obtain serial data comprising a succession of logical 1 continuing until the relationship between the pixel data A and the output B of the counter 23 is represented by Fig. 10 shows contents to be converted with another embodiment of the P S converter 14 as matrix. When image data is configured as parallel data having 8 bits as shown, the gradation data can be expressed as serial data comprising 00....00 , ....., and 11....11 representative of 0 to 255, respectively. As stated above, data stored in the buffer per each line of the transfer head 16 is delivered to the P S converter 14 and then is converted into serial data. The serial data thus obtained is fed to the transfer head 16 through the driver 15 and then is recorded on the image receiving paper P wound onto the transfer drum 17. Fig. 11 is a flowchart showing the operation of the sublimation transfer printer 1 according to the present invention. First is to carry out a preparatory operation e.g. the setting of paper and search for beginning of a ribbon, etc. step S1 to start printing operation step S2 . Thus, printing is carried out while updating the line one by one in regard of one of colors i.e. C cyan , M magenta , Y yellow and K black steps S3 and S4 . When the printing in regard of a particular single color is completed step S5 , an operation is carried out to replace it by a different color step S6 , thus continuing printing in regard of other three colors step S6 . Thus, printing is initiated from a predetermined position of the image receiving paper in regard to each color step S8 . Upon completion of the printing of four colors, the image receiving paper is drawn out step S9 . The operation of the sublimation transfer printer is thus completed. As stated above, the sublimation transfer printer according to this embodiment makes a muddiness so as to meet the characteristic of a transfer ink or effects a conscious color control based on a selective correction with respect to a particular hue to correct gradation of data per each color according to need, thereafter to deliver the corrected data to realize desired printing. Accordingly, as compared to the conventional printer configured so as to simply drive a thermal head in accordance with input three primary color data, the printer of this embodiment makes it possible to extremely efficiently make a high precision and high quality color hard copy from various images. Fig. 12 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a calibration print making device according to the present invention wherein the calibration print making device is constituted with a layout scanner A and a sublimation transfer printer B. As shown in this figure, the layout scanner A comprises a computer 301, and a memories 302 and 303, a display 304, a joy stick 305, a key board 306, a tablet digitizer 307 and a scanner unit 308 which are connected to the computer 301. On the other hand, the sublimation transfer printer B comprises the pixel density converter 3, the color corrector 4, the gradation corrector 10, the buffer 13, the P S converter 14, the driver 15, the transfer head 16 and the transfer 17 which are identical to corresponding parts in the above mentioned embodiments, respectively. The tablet digitizer 307 comprises a cursor 371 and an input surface 372. On the input surface, a sheet area 373 and a menu area 374 are provided. The scanner unit 308 comprises an input drum 381, an output drum 382, a linear encoder 383, a rotary encoder 384, and interfaces 385 and 386 connected to the computer 301. The computer 301 employed in this embodiment comprises an input computer, a layout computer and an output computer which are not shown. The pixel density converter 3 functions to effect thinning or interpolation of pictorial image data input from the computer 301 to apply pixel density conversion thereto so that a pictorial image of an arbitrary size is output from the transfer head 16. Ordinarily, the pixel density converter 3 effects pixel density conversion so that a pictorial image output to the output drum 382 of the layout scanner A has the same size as that output from the transfer head 16. The color corrector 4 functions to correct color data Y yellow , M magenta , C cyan and K black corrected in conformity with the characteristic of a print ink in the layout scanner A so as to meet the characteristic of the transfer film W. The gradation corrector 10 functions to correct gradation of data per each color of Y, M, C and K input from the color corrector 4 according to need. For this purpose, the gradation corrector 10 is provided with a gradation circuit not shown , enabling emphasis of high light or shadow. The buffer 13 is provided with first and second buffers not shown for writing data corresponding one line of the transfer head 16 thereinto. These first and second buffers are accessed by turns in a manner that when data is written into one, data is read from the other, thus preventing interference between write and read operation of the pictorial image data. Then, the operation of the print making device shown in Fig. 12 will be described. Initially, the operation of the layout scanner A will be referred to. The layout scanner A carries out editing work, etc. of pictorial image data in accordance with various manuscripts, a layout designatin sheet and other instruction sheets, etc. as follows. First is to stick a manuscript on the input drum 381 of the scanner unit 308 to input X direction positional data from the linear encoder 383, Y direction positional data from the rotary encoder 384, and pictorial image data of the manuscript to the input computer not shown of the computer 301 through the interface 385 to store them into the memory 302. The pictorial image data in respect of a suitable range of a manuscript based on the layout designation sheet not shown is input. The pictorial image data thus input will be subject to trimming by the layout computer not shown of the computer 301. The interface 385 employed in this embodiment has a corrective function such as color correction and gradation correction, etc. By making use of a corrective function, correction processing suited to the characteristic of the print ink is applied to the input pictorial image data of the manuscript. The memory 302 into which the pictorial image data which has undergone the correction processing is written is separated from the input computer and is connected to the layout computer. Thus, an image corresponding to the pictorial image data written in the memory 302 is displayed on the display 304. An operator observes the displayed image to operate the joy stick 305 while making reference to the layout deignation sheet to move the cursor to designate a trimming range or the position of tint laying. In addition, the operator designates magnification factor, board surface color and halftone percentage, etc. Since these data are written into the memory, when write operation of these data into the memory 303 is completed, the memory 303 is separated from the layout computer and is connected to the output computer not shown of the computer 301. Thus, the data stored in the memory 303 is output from the output computer. When making a film original board by making use of this data, an operation is carried out to output the data to the film set on the output drum of the scanner unit 308 through the interface 386. The above mentioned work carried out with the joy stick and the keyboard may be done by the operation of the tablet digitizer 307. To realize this, a method is employed to set the above mentioned layout designation sheet in a sheet area of the tablet digitizer 307 to selectively input position data of a pictorial pattern described on the layout designation sheet and various menus set in the menu area 374. The pictorial image data thus edited is input from the output computer to the sublimation transfer printer B per each line of the transfer head 16. The operation of the sublimation transfer printer B will be described. Initially, when the pictorial image data corresponding to one line of the transfer head 16 is input from the layout scanner A to the pixel density converter 3, the pixel density converter 3 converts the pictorial image data into data having a pixel density of the sublimation transfer printer B to input the data thus obtained to the color corrector 4. The pictorial image data output from the scanner A ordinarily has a pixel density of about 12 to 20 lines mm. Accordingly, since the pixel density thereof is higher than that of the sublimation transfer printer B, thinning processing is ordinarily carried out in the pixel density converter 3. It is preferable that the sublimation transfer printer B has a pixel density of more than 10 lines mm. Then, the data of Y, M, C and K corrected in the gradation corrector 10 are written into the buffer 13. Since the buffer 13 is constituted with first and second buffers not shown accessed by turns, the data read from the first and second buffers are input to the P S converter 14 as parallel data, thus being converted into serial data. Fig. 13 is an explanatory view of the signal processing operation in another embodiment of the color corrector 4 and the gradation corrector 10 shown in Fig. 16. In this embodiment, color corrected data with respect to input pictorial image data is obtained by executing three processings described below In this processing, the magnitude of the color data c, m, y is normalized between 0 low luminance and 1 high luminance . Namely, In this instance, a1, a2, a3 are called pre processed data . This processing comprises a separation conversion processing of hue data c1, m1, y1 which advance in parallel on the basis of the pre processed data a1, a2, a3 , a separation conversion processing of muddiness data c1 , m1 , y1 and a separation conversion processing of gradation data g. Initially, the separation conversion processing of the color data will be described. Factors for determining hue are determined as follows Fig. 14 is a view showing the relationship between a ratio of a2 a3 a1 a3 and hue arranged in order of wavelength. As seen from this figure, hue in the above mentioned case I is given as a point immediately before one of color data c, m, y which is considered as the data a1 among points obtained by dividing a real number line into two segments on the hue curve as shown in Fig. 18 on the basis of a given ratio of a2 a3 a1 a3 . Further, hue in the above mentioned case II is given as a point where one of color data c, m, y which is considered as the data a1 is positioned. For instance, when color data c, m, y is expressed as c 0.3, m 0.1 and y 0, relationships of a1 c 0.3, a2 m 0.1 and a3 y 0 are obtained. In this case, since a2 a3, a2 a3 a1 a3 1 3. Accordingly, a point represented by asterisk in Fig. 18 is obtained as the hue of the above mentioned color data on the basis of the ratio of a2 a3 a1 a3 1 3 and the relationship of a1 c. Fig. 15 is a graph showing a hue table wherein abscissa and ordinate represent hue in order of wavelength and an amount of a transfer ink density at the maximum gradation in respect of each hue, respectively. By making use of this hue table, conversion is executed with reference to the above described hue position, thereby making it possible to hue data c1, m1, y1 corresponding to the density at the time of the maximum gradation necessary for each color when a pictorial image is transferred from the transfer film W onto the image receiving paper P. Then, the separation conversion processing of muddiness data will be described. A muddiness quantity is expressed by a quantity of a complementary color included in a certain color. Accordingly, complementary color with respect to the input color data c, m, y is expressed as 1 c, 1 m, 1 y . When an operation is carried out to apply sorting to the complementary color thereafter to arange colors thus sorted in order of value thereof, the relationship a3, a2, a1 is obtained. Accordingly, a3 a1 is a rate of muddiness to be added to the hue data c1, m1, y1 . Then, a computation expressed as equation 1 for obtaining muddiness data is carried out using the hue data c1, m1, y1 corresponding to the density at the time of maximum gradation necessary for each color obtained in the above mentioned processing and the data 21 and 23. Then, the separation conversion processing of gradation data will be described. It is first noted that gradation can be expressed by a value of the data a1 itself. This is because the color data c, m, y is normalized from the minimum value 0 to the maximum value 1 in the pre processing 1 and the gradation of the hue necessarily becomes maximum when a1 1. Namely, gradation is given by a ratio of the data a1 to the maximum value of the data a1. In this instance, since the maximum value of the data a1 is equal to 1, the gradation becomes a1 1 a1. Then, a gradation conversion table as shown in Fig. 16 is prepared to determine gradation data g having a desired characteristic on the basis of the value of the data a1 by making reference to this gradation conversion table. In this processing, density data c2, m2 and y2 necessary for each color except for the black data are calculated using the following equation 2 When transfer from the transfer film W to the image receiving paper P is carried out using the density data thus obtained, it is possible to obtain a printed matter having a desired coloring i.e. a printed matter identical to one printed using a print ink. The correction work of each color is carried out as follows. The work for determining hue is to select a desired one from the characteristics of the hue table shown in Fig. 15. The work for determining muddiness is to adjust the value of a3 a1 shown in the above mentioned equation 1 per each color. In addition, the work for determining gradation is to select a desired one from the characteristics of the gradation table shown in Fig. 16. These works are independent of each other and correspond to three attributes of color from an inspectual point of view. Accordingly, they can be extremely easily and precisely carried out. As stated above, when the layout scanner is used to apply color correction and gradation correction to the pictorial image data laid out for printing board so as to meet the characteristic of a transfer ink used, thereafter to effect transfer from the sublimation transfer sheet to the image receiving paper, it is possible to obtain a calibration color hard copy directly using the sublimation transfer printer without making a film original board. The color hard copy thus obtained advantageously provides not only excellent gradation reproduction and resolution inherent in the sublimation transfer printer, but also the same high precision and high quality as those of an actual printed matter made using a printing board and a printing ink. Fig. 17 is a block diagram illustrating a further embodiment of a calibration print making device according to the present invention. The device of this embodiment comprises a drawing device A, and a device for effecting trimming layout by utilizing the result obtained by the drawing operation in the drawing device. The drawing device A comprises a tablet digitizer 410, a CPU 401 cooperative with the tablet digitizer 4, and other components. The tablet digitizer 410 comprises a cursor 411 and an input surface 412. On the input surface, a sheet area 413, a first menu area 414, and a second menu area 415 are provided. A floppy disk device 402, a plotter 403 and a mask cutter 404 are connected to the CPU 401. The trimming layout device B comprises a scanner 420 including an input drum 421 and an output drum 422, interfaces 425 and 426, an input computer 427, a layout computer 429, a printer computer 440, a storage unit 434, and the floppy disk unit 402. On the input drum 21, a linear encoder 423 and a rotary encoder 424 connected to an interface 425 are arranged. To the input output computer 427, the floppy disk device 402 and a key board 428 are connected. Further, to this computer 427 the input and output drums 421 and 422 are connected through the interfaces 425 and 426, respectively. To the layout computer 429, the floppy disk device 402, a display 430, a key board 431 and a mouse 432 are connected. To the printer computer 440, the storage unit 441 is connected. Further, to this computer 440, a sublimation transfer printer 450 is connected through an interface 442. Further, the input output computer 427, the layout computer 429 and the printer computer 440 are connected to the storage units 434 through a connection switching unit 33. In addition, the sublimation transfer printer 450 comprises a P S converter 451, a driver 452, a transfer head 453, and a transfer drum 454. Then, the operation of the calibration print making apparatus shown in Fig. 17 will be described. In the drawing apparatus A, various layout data including a trimming range, a picture pattern number, a board surface color, a stet color, a halftone percentage, and a variable magnification designated by a pictorial pattern described on a layout designation paper are created as follows. First is to set the layout designation paper on the tablet digitizer 410. The layout designation paper corresponds to the sheet area 413 in Fig. 24 wherein the sheet area and the layout designation paper are denoted by reference numeral 413. On the layout designation paper 413, a ruled line indicating a range to be subject to trimming of the manuscript and a simple figure showing a contour line of the picture pattern are drawn. Next is to input position data by placing the cursor 411 along the ruled line of the trimming range. In this instance, when the shape of the trimming range is one of several shapes determined in advance, e.g., a rectangle, the position data can be input with a simple method. Namely, when the trimming range is rectangular, a method can be employed to select rectangle of the first menu area 414 using the cursor 411 to input only two vertices of left and right upper corners in regard of the position. After the trimming range is thus set, a specified point of the picture pattern e.g. the position of the eye in the case of human being is input using the cursor 411. A method may be employed to implement marking in advance to a point on the layout designation sheet corresponding to an easily recognized portion e.g. a corner of the manuscript or a corner of performance, etc., to use the point thus marked as a specified point. Then, an input operation is conducted by making use of the second menu area 415. By using this menu area 415, data which can be utilized in the trimming layout apparatus B e.g. a manuscript number, a board surface color, a stet color, a halftone percentage of tint laying, and a variable magnification, etc. are input. The data thus input using the tablet digitizer 410 is recorded on the floppy disk 402 through the CPU 401. This floppy disk 402 is loaded on the trimming layout apparatus B so that its recorded content will be utilized. Further, this recorded content is also delivered to the plotter 403 or the mask cutter 404 for use in taking of photograph of letter or print, etc. Then, the operation of the trimming layout apparatus B will be described. In the trimming layout device B, the computers 427 and 429 read data from the floppy disk 402 in which various layout data are recorded by the drawing device A to carry out layout processing as follows. First is to set a manuscript on the input drum 421 of the scanner 420 to conduct an alignment operation so that an aiming of a magnifying glass or Lupe not shown and a specified point of the manuscript picture are equal to each other. At this time, position data output from the linear encoder 423 and the rotary encoder 424 represent coordinates of the specified point of the manuscript picture. Next is to operate the keyboard 428 to rotate the input drum 421, thus to input the pictorial image data of the manuscript to the computer 427 through the interface 425. The interface 425 employed in this embodiment has a correction function e.g. color correction and gradation correction etc. By making use of the correction function, correction processing, is applied to the input pictorial image data of the manuscript so as to meet the characteristic of a printing ink. The computer 427 reads ruled line information and specified point coordinates on the layout designation paper, and a specified point on the manuscript picture input on the input drum 421 from the floppy disk 402 to calculate a trimming area of the manuscript to store only the pictorial image data included in the trimming area into the storage unit 434. Thus, the pictorial image data corresponding to one page is stored in the storage unit 434. Then, the layout computer 429 reads the pictorial image data corresponding to one page from the storage unit 434 to carry out trimming layout processing on the basis of various layout data stored in the floppy disk 402. In this trimming layout processing, the entirety of the pictorial image data input by the computer 427 or a portion thereof is displayed on the display 430. Then, correction or alternation of the trimming range or layout is made by operating the keyboard 431 and the mouse 432. Thus, the pictorial image data corresponding to one page which has undergone final trimming layout processing will be stored in the storage unit 434 as output pictorial image data. Such input and output pictorial image data may be stored in the same storage unit or in a plurality of storage units. A method of effecting trimming of pictorial image data is not limited to the above mentioned method in which the computer 427 automatically performs trimming on the basis of position data of a specified point input on the input drum 421 and data stored in the floppy disk 402. Such a trimming may be carried out with various other methods. For instance, there may be employed a method wherein the input of position data of a specified point of the manuscript on the input drum is eliminated. According to this method, pictorial image data slightly larger in the magnitude than an actual trimming range is input to display the pictorial image data on the display 430 to effect final trimming by operating the mouse 432 on the display to input the position of a specified point of the display image. Then, the storage unit 434 which has stored the output pictorial image data therein is connected to the input output computer 427 by using the connection switching unit 433. The input output computer 427 forms an image corresponding to one page on the film set on the output drum 422 through the interface 426. The connection switching unit 433 is a unit for switching connection between computers and the storage unit in response to a command from each computer. In the above mentioned embodiment, the same computer can be used for the computers 427 and 429. In addition, the storage unit illustrated as a single one in Fig. 17 can be constituted with a plurality of storage units e.g. fixed disks. Such a storage arrangement is suitable for handling image data having large quantity of data. Then, the operation of the printer computer 440 and the sublimation transfer printer 450 will be described. Fig. 18 is a flowchart schematically showing processing contents of the computer 440. First is to operate a keyboard not shown connected to the computer 440 to read pictorial image data corresponding to i lines stored in the storage unit 434 thereinto step S21 . The pictorial image data read into the computer 440 may be data to which trimming layout processing has been applied in the computer 429 or data input by the computer 427, which does not undergo trimming layout processing. Then, pixel density conversion is carried out step S22 to make the pictorial image data corresponding to i lines step S23 . By executing the pixel density conversion in the step S22, it is possible to output a pictorial image having an arbitrary magnitude from the transfer head 16. Ordinarily, a pictorial image having the same magnitude as that of the pictorial image to the output drum 422 of the scanner 420 is output from the transfer head 16. In addition, the pixel density of the pictorial image data output from the scanner 420 ordinarily has about 12 to 20 lines mm. Accordingly, since this pixel density is higher than the pixel density of the sublimation transfer printer, thinning processing is ordinarily carried out in the pixel density conversion in the step S22. Fig. 19 is an explanatory view showing changes of the pictorial image data in the steps S21 to S23. In this figure, pictorial image data read from the storage unit 34 is designated at 501 by the computer 440, pictorial image data which has undergone pixel density conversion in the step S22 is designated at 502, and X direction represents a line direction of read operation. As shown, the pictorial image data comprises m0 x n0 pixels. In the step S21, the pictorial image data corresponding to one line i.e. m0 x i pixels are read to the computer 440. In the step S22, density conversion in X and Y directions is carried out thinning processing is carried out in the figure . In the step S23, pictorial image data correspondng to j lines i.e. m1 x j pixels is made. Thus, the pictorial image data 502 comprising m1 x n1 pixels is output from the transfer head 16. Then, color correction is implemented to the pictorial image data corresponding to j lines made in the step S23 using a color corrector not shown provided in the computer 440 step S23 , which has a function similar to that of the color corrector 4 in Fig. 1. The pictorial image data read from the storage unit 434 is data of Y, M, C and K. In the color correction in the step S24, correction of data of Y, M and C is mainly carried out. Then, each data of Y, M, C and K corresponding to j lines color corrected in the step S24 undergoes correction of gradation using a gradation corrector not shown provided in the computer 440 step S25 , which has a function similar to that of the gradation corrector 10 in Fig. 1. Subsequently, the pictorial image data corresponding to j lines which has undergone gradation correction in the step S25 is stored in the storage unit 441 step S26 . After line is updated step S27 , a series of processings shown in the steps S21 to S26 will be applied to pictorial data corresponding to the next i lines. Then, the pictorial image data stored in the storage unit 441 is read through the interface 442 per each line of the transfer head 16. The data thus read is input to the P S converter 14 of the sublimation transfer printer as parallel data, thereby being converted into serial data. Thus, the data output from the interface 442 per each line of the transfer head 16 is delivered to the P S converter 14, thereby being converted into serial data. The serial data thus obtained is delivered to the transfer head 16 through the driver 15, and then is recorded on the image receiving paper on the transfer drum 17. As stated above, first is to take out layout data for effecting layout of a pictorial image input by the scanner by making use of the layout designation paper set on the tablet digitizer to record the layout data thus obtained on a recording medium. Next is to load the recording medium on the layout computer. The employment of such a layout system eliminates the necessity of carrying out layout work using a display for a long time as in the commonly used layout scanners. In addition, when color correction and gradation correction are implemented to pictorial image data which has been layed out for printing board using the layout scanner in conformity with the characteristic of the transfer ink, thereafter to effect transfer from the sublimation transfer sheet to the image receiving paper, it is possible to obtain a color hard copy for calibration directly using the sublimation transfer printer without making a film original board. The color hard copy thus obtained provides not only excellent gradation reproduction and resolution inherent in the sublimation transferprinter, but also the same high precision and high quality as actual printed materials made up using a printing board and a printing ink. As a result, this advantageously provides a greatly improved printing board working efficiency by the layout scanner. Fig. 20 shows a color of dye i.e. a color pattern of the transfer ink contained in the transfer layer provided in the transfer film W. As shown, transfer ink layers of four colors of Y, M, C and BK are provided in succession as a continuous pattern in the transfer film W. Fig. 21 is an explanatory view showing an example of a method for converting three primary color data of the original images of R, G and B into respective density data Dr, Dg and Db. In this figure, ordinate and abscissa represent values of density data to be converted and values of the original image data, respectively. It is now assumed that data value at a most bright portion of the original image solid portion where any ink does not exist in the case of ordinarily making a hard copy of the original image is represented by OH, data value at a most dark portion thereof a portion showing a maximum density obtained by allowing the maximum densities of the three primary colors or more than three colors to overlap with each other is represented by OS. A method is employed to use the density data value of OH as a reference density O to determine density data value DS of S buy allowing it to be in correspondence with a density value in each filter of R, G and B used for obtaining a color hard copy from the original pictorial image data in a range where the density data value DS of S is 1.0 to 3.0 preferably, 1.4 to 2.3 . By connecting two points H OH, O and S OS, DS thus determined using a suitable curve, a conversion curve F is obtained. By making use of this conversion curve F, primary color data R, G and B of the original pictorial image are converted into density data Dr, Dg and Db, respectively. It is important to take into account the following points when determining a conversion curve. Next is to determine density data Cr, Mg, Yb and Bk of transfer inks C, M, Y and K forming a color hard copy of the original image on the basis of the density data Dr, Dg and Db obtained. In this instance, it is necessary to first determine the density data K of BK. An example of the determination method will be described. First is to evaluate the minimum value Dmin of the above mentioned density data Dr, Dg and Db using the following equation Fig. 22 is an explanatory view showing an example of a method for evaluating the value of Dk with respect to the value of Dmin. In this figure, abscissa and ordinate represent values of Dmin and values of Dk, respectively. As shown the value of Dk with respect to Dmin can be determined by making use of the conversion curve FD. It is possible to employ the value of Dk thus obtained as density data K of BK i.e. Dr K . It is to be noted that the value of DK can be easily obtained as an electric signal using a known non linear amplifier circuit. After the density data K is thus determined, density data Cr, Mg and Yb of other transfer inks C, M and Y are determined in a manner stated below. It is now assumed that respective filter densities of the above mentioned R, G and B are defined below with respect to solid portions where respective transfer inks show the maximum densities The ratios of the principal density to densities of other filters are expressed as follows Since the above mentioned density data Dr, Dg and Db become multicolor density obtained by adding respective filter densities of the transfer inks C, M, Y and BK, the following equations hold On the other hand, since the density data K of BK is DK determined as shown in Fig. 22, the above mentioned equations are expressed as follows where a Accordingly, it is possible to easily derive density data Cr, Mg, Yb and K of the transfer inks C, M, Y and BK from the density data Dr, Dg and Db using an electric circuit. In the case where a color pictorial image signal from the image input device 2 is a composite color signal comprising a luminance signal and a color signal, it is possible to apply signal conversion to the composite color signal to convert it into three primary color data of R, G and B, thereafter to obtain the density data Cr, Mg, Yg and K using the above mentioned method. In addition, it is also possible to directly determine the density data K of the transfer ink BK on the basis of the above mentioned luminance signal to obtain density data Cr, Mg, Yb and K on the basis of the density data K and the above mentioned color signals given by R, G and B using the above mentioned method. Accordingly, such a method will be described. In general, composite color signals of NTSC system, PAL system and SECAM system etc. classified according to the transmission system are known. The composite color signal of NTSC system employed in Japan or U. S. A. etc. will be described. The NTSC system is adapted to convert a pictorial image signal given by the three primary colors of R, G and B into a luminance signal L and color signals I and Q to transmit signals thus converted. When values of pictorial image signals R, G and B are represented by E As the receiving side, the signals E Fig. 23 is an explanatory view showing an example of a method for deriving density data K of the transfer ink BK directly from the value E By applying the value of Dk thus obtained and the primary color data obtained by inversely converting E
