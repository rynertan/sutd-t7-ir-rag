# Composite wire for HF applications, coil wound from such a wire, and deflection unit comprising such a coil.

## Abstract
A composite wire which consists of a number of preferably parallel extending single wire strands bundled to form one solid assembly at least one of which is a bare wire. The composite wire 8 is constructed especially from a bare wire 15 around which a number, for example, five, six or more, single wire strands 9 14 having a thin insulating layer are arranged in the form of a bunch. The assembly is surrounded by a layer of an electrically insulating material, which itself may be surrounded by a layer of a thermo plastic material. This wire is particularly suitable for winding saddle shaped deflection coils for deflection units for cathode ray tubes.
