# CONTINUOUS ROTARY THERMO FORMING SYSTEMS AND APPARATUS OF THE PRESSURE ASSIST, PLUG ASSIST AND MATCH MOLD TYPE

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus are provided for pressure and or plug assist and match molding configurations for in line continuous rotary thermo forming systems. The pressure assist, plug assist and matched mold devices are carried on continuous endless loop indexing structures which accurate ly index them with the mold cavities in respective rotary mold wheels to achieve high thermo forming speeds without loss of quality in the ultimate products. The drives of the continuous endless loop indexing structures are synchro nized with those of the mold wheel. The systems are continuous ones in which the webs to be thermoformed are continuously extruded and from which the thermo formed products are continuously cut and stacked downstream of the rotary mold wheel, with the web selvage being returned and recycled into the extrusion device.
