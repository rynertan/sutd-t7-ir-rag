# ELLIPTICAL CROSS SECTION SLOTTED TUBE RADIO FREQUENCY RESONATOR FOR NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING

## Abstract
A radio frequency coil, for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging at Larmor frequencies associated with a magnetic field of greater than about 0.5 Tesla, comprises a slotted tube radio frequency resonator having an elliptical cross section. First and second complementary outer resonator portions have central bands connecting juxtaposed wing structures the end of each of the four wings is spaced from a complementary wing portion of the other outer portion and capacitively coupled thereto. An inner structure has a pair of elliptical guard rings placed substantially in registration with the elliptical portions of the outer structure wing portions. The eccentricity ratio of the elliptical cross section of the resonator and the resonator dimensions are arranged to provide an interior volume into which a human head or body extremity can be placed for imaging purposes.
