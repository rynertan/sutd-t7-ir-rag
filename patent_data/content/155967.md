# SPRING TYPE CLUTCH DISK.

## Abstract
A spring type clutch disk in which torque is transmitted from a disk plate 2 to a hub 3 through coiled springs 12 , 13 . Between the disk plate 2 and the hub 3 are interposed an inner friction washer 11b and a bush which are in sliding contact with the hub 3 . Either one of the hub 3 and the assembly of the inner friction washer 11b and the bush is subjected to electroless Ni plating while the other is subjected to electroless Ni P BN plating, thereby stabilizing the friction coefficient at the frictional area between both of them and improving the resistance to wear. Thus, the first stage hys teresis torque in the torsional characteristics of the clutch disk is maintained in a stable manner with minimum effort.
