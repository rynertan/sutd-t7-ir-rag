# Hermetic electro optic display cell.

## Abstract
A hermetic electro optic display cell has an enclosure for a liquid electrolyte comprising a wall 15 of a plastics material, a lower inorganic base and an upper window both of which are impervious to the electrolyte. Impervious gasket means seals at least the lower edges of the wall to the base when clamped together. To render the wall hermetic an inorganic coating is provided around the exterior faces and along the edges at least as far as the gasket means. Metal is the preferred coating except for transparent faces where silica may be employed.
