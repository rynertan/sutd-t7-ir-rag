# IMPLANTABLE ARTIFICIAL SOUND SOURCE

## Abstract
An implantable sound source for human voice produc tion to replace the natural larynx surgically removed, for example, because of cancer, consists of a disc like stainless steel body 10 one circular wall of which consists of a diaphragm 14 laser welded to the remainder. Circumferen tial suture receiving bores 18 are provided for fastening the source to the host body. Apiezoceramic transducer 22 is cemented to the diaphragm interior wall and is fed via an electromagnetic coupling consisting of a secondary coil 30 implanted in the chest wall of the host. A coupling core 36 is in two parts spring biased together and carries a primary coil 38 connected to an AC electric power source, thus permit ting the core to be disconnected at will leaving only the implanted portions. The frequency of the supply is allowed to vary somewhat to give a more natural sounding reproduc tion and, for the same purpose, is arranged to droop over a short period corresponding approximately to the length of a normal breath.
