# Punch through voltage regulator diodes and methods of manufacture.

## Abstract
The application is a punch through voltage regulator having an active region formed on a substrate by any one of four different methods. Each method includes recessing the substrate substantially along the periphery of the re gulator active region, selectively doping the regulator active region through portions of the recess 21, 23 , filling the recesses with substrate oxide to isolate the active region from the substrate and forming conductors to selectively doped portions of the active region to serve as electrode connections. For P doped substrates N type doping is in troduced via the recesses and in a second method the recesses are deepened and P type doping is introduced into the substrate to change the doping in the active region. For N doped substrates P type doping is introduced via the recesses and when the recesses are deepened in the fourth method, N type doping is introduced into the substrate to change the doping of the active portion.
