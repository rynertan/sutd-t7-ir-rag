## Description
Perfluoroalkylalkylenemercapto group containing non ionic surfactants, process for their manufacture and their use. The instant invention relates to novel fluorinated non ionic surfactants of the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein Rf is perfluoroalkyl of 4 to 20 carbon atoms, or perfluoro alkoxyperfluoroalkyl of 4 to 20 carbon atoms, A is straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 10 carbon atoms which is unsubstituted or is substituted by halogen, preferably by chloro or fluoro, n is 1 to 50,R1 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R2 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, Rf is perfluoroalkyl of 4 to 16, preferably 4 to 14 carbon atoms or said perfluoroalkyl substituted by perfluoroalkoxy of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, A is unsubstituted alkylene of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably ethylene, n is 5 to 25, R1 is hydrogen or methyl,R2 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl and n is 5 to 50. Where n is less than 5, the resulting compounds have little water solubility. However, such compounds are useful as surfactants in non aqueous systems, as mold release agents in the plastics and silicone industry, as well as grease and oil repellants for paper.Those compounds wherein R1 is predominately lower alkyl are likewise characterized by their limited water solubility and likewise possess utility as surfactants in non aqueous systems, as mold release agents and as grease and oil repellants for paper and the like. Preferred compounds are those wherein R is at least predominately hydrogen, R2 is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and n is 5 to 50, preferably 5 to 25. Such compounds are essentially water soluble. Such water soluble compounds are valuable aqueous surfactants and are useful industry wetting agents. Thus, they are useful wetting agents for biocides, cleaming compositions and detergents, as rinseaids for cars, dishes an the like, as emulsifiers, and as levelling agents in the dye and pigment industry. The compounds of t4e instant invention are easily prepared by any one of a number ef n woes. The compounds can 4e prepared conveniently by reacting an alkoxylated compound of WEe formulaEMI3.1 with epichlorohydrin in bulk or in a common dry and aprotic solvent, including ketones, such as acetone gr methyl ethyl ketone ethers such as diethylether, ethylenglycol dimethylether or tetrahydrofuran esters such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyleneglycol acetate and amides, such as dimethylformamide or N methyl pyrrolidone. A Lewis acid catalyst, such as boron trifluoride usually in the form of the diethyl ether complex tberof or aluminium chloride, is used to promote the formation of the halohydrin intermediate.If the reaction is run in the absence of a solvent, it is advantageously run at a temperature above the melting point of the alkoxylated compound with boron trifluoride etherate. The reaction is ordinarily exothermic. It is generally not necessary te isolate the halohydrin intermediate, and the next rection can be carried out in the same vessel. The halohydrin intermediate has tha formulaEMI3.2 In the second step, the perfluoroalkylalkylene mercaptan Rf A SH US Patent Specification 3,172,910 is added to the halohydrin intermediate, followed by the addition of an equivalent amount of base as an acid acceptor. This step may advantageously be carried out in bulk or in the presence of aprotic or protic solvents.As apotic solvents, there may be used those recited above for the first step. Suitable protic solvents include water, and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert. butyl alcohol, hexyleneglycol, ethyleneglycol and ethyleneglycol monoethylether, Suitable bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, pyridine, lutidine and triethylamine. Conveniently, a solvent is selected which dissolves the reactants and desired product, but not the by product salt, so that the salt will precipitate out as the reaction proceeds and can then be removed by convential techniques, such as filtration. The fluorochemical surfactant product may be left in solution or evaporated to remove the solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out between about 30 and 800 C, under a nitrogen atmosphere, with stirring.There is generally an exotherm as the base is added to the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the surfactants of the instant invention may be prepared by first reacting equimolar amounts of perfluoroalkylalkylene mercaptan, Rf A SH, and epichlorohydrin by placing them in a reaction vessel and stirring the reactants in the presence of an inert solvent, such as methyl ethyleneglycol acetate. Then a stoichiometric amount of a base, such as 50 aqueous sodium hydroxide, is slowly added to the reaction mixture. The resulting reaction is exothermic and the reaction temperature is advantageously maintained between about 20 to 600C with stirring for 1 to 3 hours. The resulting epoxide intermediate has the formulaEMI4.1 This is removed from the epoxide intermediateBy resiccal water is removed by vacuum distillation. The epoxide intermediate is then reacted with an equimolar amount, or a slight excess, of an alkoxylated compound of the formula 2 , which preferably is a poly ethyleneglycol R2 R1 H , a poly propyleneglycol R1 CH3, R2 H or an ethoxylated propoxylated lower alcohol R2 alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms . These compounds are well known in the art. This reaction is advantageously conducted under substantially anhydrous conditions in the presence of a catalyst, such as BF3 etherate, at a temperature of about 30 to 600C in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, such as methyl ethyleneglycol acetate. In one technique, the catalyst is dispersed in a mixture of the alkoxylated compounu and the solvent, and slowly added to the epoxide intermediate with stirring. Preferably, this reaction is carried out under a nitrogen blanket. The product fluorochemical surfactant may be left in solution and used as such, or may be evaporated or distilled under vacuum to remove the solvent. The fluorochemical surfactants of this invention are distinguished by their increased surface active properties vis a vis their related hydrocarbon surfactant analogs. As a result, they improve or impart properties such as wetting, penetration, spreading, leveling, foam stability, flow properties, dispersion properties and oil and water repellency.
