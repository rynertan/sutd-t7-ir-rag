# Promoted tin antimonate catalysts and use thereof.

## Abstract
A tin antimonate oxide complex catalyst of the formula A These multiply promoted Sn Sb oxides are superior cata lysts for the ammoxidation of olefins to the corresponding un saturated nitriles, the selective oxidation of olefins to unsatura ted aldehydes and acids, and the oxydehydrogenation of ole fins to diolefins.
