# Method of treating warp yarn ends in sizing process.

## Abstract
The ends of warp yarns in a sheet form are treated at the end of a sizing process in preparation for a subsequent rewinding process. In the sizing process, the warp yarns are threaded through a reed with at least two warp yarns in each reed dent in vertically spaced relation. The at least two warp yarns are threaded through one dent in a reed in the rewind ing process. Heretofore, it has been tedious and time consuming to thread the warp yarns through the reeds since the warp yarns in one reed dent cannot be distinguished from those in other reed dents in the sizing process. In the rewind ing process, a spacer such as a rod is inserted between verti cally divided sheets of the warp yarns to prevent snarling. Since the warp yarns cannot be distinguished from reed dent to reed dent, it has been difficult to insert the spacer. Accord ing to the present invention, the reed in the sizing process is displaced transversely of the warp yarns to gather the at least two warp yarns in each reed dent into a seeming single strand, and a lease thread is inserted between vertically spaced groups of the warp yarns.
