## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of organofunctional silanes having general formula I The present invention relates also to the use of these compounds in particular applications. From the technical literature, different methods are known for the synthesis of organofunctional silanes Si lane Coupling Agents, by E.P. Plueddemann, Plenum Press, 1982 Silicated Surfaces, by D.E. Leyden and W. Collins, Gordon Breach Science Publishers, 1980 for example, benzamide 4 amino N 3 triethoxysilylpropyl can be synthe tized by a step process, which can be schematically shown as follows Such a method could be used also for the synthesis of As a matter of fact, it must be observed that such synthesis processes as those sketched have never been actually tested in homogeneous phase, but in heteroge neous phase only, viz., after having fixed aminopropyltri ethoxysilane on solid matrices. Our process, which to the contrary allows the si lanes discussed to be synthetised in homogeneous phase, as it shall be disclosed hereunder, is clearly prefera ble furthermore, even by carrying out the synthesis in homogeneous phase of the silanes with the aminic group in para position, one would have, relatively to what is herein claimed, one more reaction and hence lower over all yields, longer times and higher costs. Going back to the object of the present invention, we have found that it is possible to synthetize organofun ctional silanes of general formula I by a simplified process, which gives quantitative yields, and wherein isatoic anhydride 2H 3.1 benzoxazine 2,4 1H diene and or derivatives thereof with substituents on the ben zenic ring are used. An object of the present invention is therefore a process for the synthesis of organofunctional silanes having general formula I According to this process, isatoic anhydride, or its derivatives, and aminosilanes of In particular, the synthesis is disclosed of benzamide 2 amino N 3 triethoxysilylpropyl, having the following formula The silanes practically preferred according to the purposes of the present invention are 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane H₂N CH₂ ₃ Si OC₂H₅ ₃ aminomethyltriethoxysilane H₂N CH₂ Si OC₂H₅ ₃ 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane H₂N CH₂ ₂ NH CH₂ ₃ Si OCH₃ ₃ 2 aminoethylaminopropyltriethoxysilane H₂N CH₂ ₂ NH CH₂ ₃ Si OC₂H₅ ₃ 2 aminoethylaminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane The reaction of synthesis is carried out by gradual ly adding isatoic anhydride to the aminosilane either in the presence or in the absence of solvent. By carrying out the reaction in a solvent, it is obviously necessary that this latter be not reactive with isatoic anhydride in case of hydroxylated solvents, it shall be necessary to use, e.g., mild reaction conditions, and operate in the absence of possible catalysts. However, as solvents, alcohols, ethers, chlorinated solvents, and so forth, can be used. Of course, operating is necessary in the absence of water, which would cause alkoxy groups to hydrolize. The reaction can also be carried out by adding isatoic anhydride all together, by taking in the due account the slight exothermicity of the reaction cooling shall be necessary and that, notwithstanding the consi derable difference in reactivity between the aliphatic amine aminosilane in reactivity between the aliphatic amine aminosilane and the aromatic amine reaction products , oligomeric products of type As regards the reaction to be carried out in the absence of solvent, one should keep in his mind that in this case a good stirring and a good CO₂ stripping system are necessary, and that operating in this way is possible only if the end product is liquid. The organofunctional silanes of the present inven tion find application in many fields. First of all, their use is to be reminded in compositions for use as thermo setting paints, so to obtain clear coatings uniform and resistant to solvents and to which, to the purpose of increasing their resistance to abrasion and so solvents, other organofunctional silanes can be added. Such coatings are useful to coat and protect such soft substrates as the organic polymers, to which such coatings are bonded by direct adhesion. The compositions are finished by a diluent solvent and an acid they are applied onto the surface of the substrates, and thermo set, to form insoluble coatings strongly bonded to said substrates. Such coatings confer to the substrates compatibility and characteristics of adhesion to further coatings, thus making it possible to obtain useful multilayer manufac tures, which, should such a coating be absent, could not be obtained by direct adhesion. The useful organic polymers are aromatic polycarbon ates, aliphatic polycarbonates, polyacrylates, polymetha crylates, polyesters, cellulose esters, polyacetates, polyamides, polyvinylchloride, polysulphone, polyethersul phone, polystyrene and copolymers of styrene with acrylo nitrile and acrylonitrile butadiene. The compounds having formula I can be useful in very many other fields, wherein surface modifications of solid matrices are required. In general, one can say that the surfaces of the oxides or of metals the surfaces of which are usually oxidized can be modified with organofunctional silanes to make them fit to be used in fields very different to each other, such as heterogeneous catalyses immobiliza tion of homogeneous catalysts , separation of organic substances by chromatographic way, research on elec trodes, immobilization of dyes, besides the more genera lized field of the manufacturing of composite materials, process in which the organofunctional silanes are used as coupling agents. A specific example of these possibli ties relates to the immobilization of chelating agents on siliceous surfaces to yield products for use in different processes, such as, e.g., the separation or concentration of metal ions. The immobilization of chelating agents on siliceous matrices, instead of using the traditional polymeric resins, yields advantages deriving from a greater mecha nical stability, possiblity of use under more severe conditions and higher kinetics. In case as chelating agent 8 Quinolinol is fixed on silica, usually p aminophenyltrimethoxysilane is used Anal. Chem. The normal immobilization procedure is the follow ing The main drawback is the high number of chemical reactions in heterogeneous phase some of these are very long and their yields are not much high. This leads to an end product the capacity of which, per unit weight, besides being already low due to steric hindrance pro blems, caused by the silica structure, is furthermore decreased relatively to the number of Mottola H.A. et al. Anal. Chem. Besides the considerable cost of the product, the problems exist of great steric hindrance due to the absence of a spacer group interplaced between the silicon atom and the aromatic ring, and to the consequent rela tive closeness of the aminic group to the siliceous matrix this problem is made worser by the fact that the commercial product is constituted by a mixture of the three isomers. Another improvement proposed Tolonta In the technical literature Fres. Z. Anal. Chem. The global system tested by us is schematically shown as follows The advantages deriving from the use of such compound are evident, while the possiblity should be underlined of a possible reduction of activity, deriving from the ortho position of the amino group relatively to the amido group, due to steric hindrance, as well as other possible drawbacks deriving from side reaction. To complete this survey, we remind how the chelating power, or, better, the reactivity of silica is strongly determined, with the functionalizing procedure and the operating conditions being the same, by the type of silica, and the activation thereof Anal. Chim. Acta Into 100 ml glass flask, 30 ml of ethyl ether and 7 ml 29.84 mmol of aminopropyltriethoxysilane product by Fluka are charged. Under stirring, and under nitrogen atmosphere, 4.86 g 29.84 mmol of isatoic anhydride product by Fluka is gradually added, over a total time of 45 minutes. During the addition, and also after the addition thereof 15 minutes , the evolution of CO₂ is observed very clearly, by a bubble flowmeter. At the end of the same reaction, a solution of yellowish colour is obtained which after being concentrated in vacuo 5 mm At a temperature of 164 C, under a vacuum of 10 ⁵ mm An aliquot of this product is submitted to N.M.R. analysis, using deuterochloroform as the solvent. The resulting spectrum is in accordance with the proposed structure, and more precisely is composed by the follow ing signals δ 0.645 multiplet 2H, CH₂ Si 1.18 triplet 9H, CH₃ 1.70 multiplet 2H, CH₂ CH₂ 3.32 multiplet 2H, CH₂ N 3.76 quadruplet 6H, CH₂O 5.76 broad 2H, NH₂ 6.40 7.50 5H, , NHCO. Also I.R. and mass spectrometry spectra are in accordance with the proposed structure. The same experimental test as of Example 1 is repeat ed, but using ethyl alcohol as the solvent, and the same product being obtained in the amount of 7.92 g. Into a 100 ml three necked flask, the following products commercial products by Fluka are charged under nitrogen atmosphere These amounts of silanes correspond to an APS MTS I II molar ratio of 1 4. To this solution 4.89 g of isatoic anhydride is gradually added under stirring. At the end of the addi tion, and at the end of CO₂ evolution, 1.36 ml of H₂O, 2 ml of acetic acid, and 8 ml of absolute ethyl alcohol are added, an end solution with pH 4 being obtained. This solution is kept stirred 2 days, and is then filtered on a 3µ filter. The amount of water introduced into the solution corresponds to that necessary to hydrolyze 1 6 of total alkoxy groups of the two silanes. A solution analogous to the foregoing and obtained in the same way is prepared, with the only difference that APS MTS ratio is 1 1. The amount of water added corresponds this time to 1 10 of the total alkoxy groups. The compositions obtained according to Examples 3 and 4 have been used to paint samples of polycarbonate shaped as square slabs with side of 15 cm, and of 3 mm in thickness, obtained by injection moulding the commercial material SINVET 251 01. The painting has been carried out 2 days and 20 days later than the preparation date, no differences in performance being observed as for the relevant characteristics adhesion, resistance to H₂O, etc. . The specimens have been painted at 20 C, inside a chamber maintained at a relative humidity of 28 , by the dipping technique, the specimens being moved at the speed of 115 cm min. Each specimen has been left 15 minutes under air, and has been then oven cooked at 120 C for 90 minutes. Coatings having thickness ranging from 2 to 5 microns are so obtained. To comparative purposes, by the same modalities specimens have been painted with solutions having the same concentration of silane, and of the other components of the solution H₂O, CH₃COOH, EtOH , by using methyltri methoxysilane MTS and aminopropyltriethoxysilane as the silanic components compositions 5 and 6 . On the painted specimens the properties of the coat ings, and more precisely the transmittance, the adhesion, the abrasion resistance and the resistance to acetone have been tested. The transmittance has been measured by using a GAR DENER HAZEMETER. The adhesion to the substrates has been measured by cutting on the surface 100 squares of 1 mm in side, having case that the depth of the cuts be higher than the coatings thickness. On the cut squares, a section of adhesive tape type Scotch Brand Magic Transparent Tape No. 810 3M was applied. After applying a strong pres sure, the tape has been abruptly peeled away, by pulling at an angle of 90 relatively to the specimen surface. To the adhesion a rating comprised between 0 and 100 is thus given, as a function of the number of squares peeled away after three repeated tests. The abrasion resistance has been determined accord ing to ASTM D1044, by a TABER abrasion meter, using CS 10F grinding wheels under a 500 g load, and measuring the increase in HAZE as a function of the number of cycles. The resistance to acetone is evaluated by applying onto the surface an absorbent cotton pad soaked with solvent, and verifying the presence of possible spots of attack. The results are displayed as a function of the different properties. As for the adhesion soon after the painting, none of samples prepared show peelings. To the contrary, after the test of resistance in hot water at 80 C, samples 5 and 6 show peelings of the order of 50 already after 12 hours, whilst samples 3 and 4 have much higher perfor mance as for such a resistance. More precisely, sample 3 shows peelings lower than 4 after 15 days in H₂O at 80 C sample 4 does not show any attacks after 18 days in H₂O at 80 C. The values of HAZE are reported of polycarbonate as such Pc , and Samples 3 and 4, as a function of the cycle number. Whilst Pc as such is immediately attacked by ace tone, sample 3 and 4 show only punctiform attacks after more than 5 minutes. A A1. Into a 250 ml flask 10 g of silica Merck 60, prelimi narily kept 4 hours in oven at 100 C, and 50 cc of toluene dried by molecular sieves are introduced under nitrogen 3 g of ATPS is then added. The reaction mixture is refluxed 4 5 hours. The silica is then filtered off, repeatedly washed with anhydrous toluene and ethanol dried in oven at 100 C, and is then stored in desiccator. The procedure is the same as of preceding A1. Product A2 2 g is charged into a 100 cc flask with 60 ml of tetrahydrofuran, then 2 g of isatoic anhydride is added, and the whole is refluxed under stirring, with a spherical bulb condenser. The reaction, differently to the analogous reaction in homogeneous phase, is considerably slower, as it can be seen from the evolution of CO₂ from the bubble meter. After three hours, the solid product is filtered off, is repeatedly washed with tetrahydrofuran, a further 50 ml of the same solvent is added, with an amount of n propylamine slightly in excess relatively to the initial amount of isatoic anhydride, to the purpose of removing unreacted anhydride. After the end of CO₂ evo lution, the product is filtered off, is washed with tetrahydrofuran and thanol, and is dried. First of all, the reaction is carried out between AEAPS and isatoic anhydride in equimolecular ratio 100 mmol , in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran under N₂ for 4 hours. At the end of CO₂ evolution, 5 g is added of SiO₂, and the procedure as of the other cases is then followed. Into a 50 ml beaker, 1 g of silica functionalized with an aromatic amine, and the 30 ml of 2N HCl are added. Under stirring, and at the temperature of 5 C, an aqueous solution 1 g in 20 ml is added of NaNO₂. Two hours after the addition of NaNO₂, the silica is washed three times with cold H₂O 50 ml each time . Silicas having a more or less bright yellow colour, typical of diazonium salts, are unvariably obtained. As said, the coupling reaction can take place at different pH values in our case, with the exception of the situations wherein the diazotization and coupl ing reactions are carried out in one step only, in water alcoholic solution due to the insolubility of 8 hydroxyquinoline in water, all the coupling reactions are carried out at pH of 8 hydroxyquinoline, both in water alcoholic, and in alcoholic solution. In a typical example, to the immobilized diazo salt freshly prepared 10 minutes , a large excess of solu tion of 8 hydroxyquinoline is added, the whole is made react under stirring for about one hour, and then, after filtering, is repeatedly washed with 1N HCl, H₂O, ethanol and acetone, until from the filtrate the colour disappears. In all the preparations, a deep purple colour has developed, qualitative indication of 8 hydroxyquinol ine coupling. In a typical test, about 20 ml of a standard solution containing about 150 µg ml of Cu prepared from CuSO₄ 5H₂O in acetate buffer at pH 5, are charged into a flask containing about 0.2 g of silica. The mass is kept agitated by a shaker about 1 hour kine tic measurements have shown that this time is enough , and the silica is then filtered off. The measurement of the chelating capacity is carried out by using as the computation basis the difference in concentration between the standard solution and the filtrate. The measurements are carried out by atomic absorption analysis. The chelating capacity of silica alone has also been measured, by being afraid that it could con siderably influence the values found.
