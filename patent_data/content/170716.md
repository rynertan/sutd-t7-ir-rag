# Information medium.

## Abstract
An information medium used for receiving delivering information from to an exterior device, which includes a receiver circuit 12, 13 for receiving a modulated input signal from the exterior device, a demodulator 14 for de modulating the modulated input signal to provide specific information E14 , a decoder 15 for decoding the specific information E14 to provide a decoded instruction E15 , a memory 17 for storing given data, a controller 16 for controlling a write or read operation of the memory 17 in accordance with the contents of the decoded instruction E15 , a modulator 18 for generating a modulated signal E18 which corresponds to data read out from the memory 17 , a transmitter circuit 19, 20 for delivering to the ex terior device a transmission signal corresponding to the modulated signal E18 , a battery 21 for generating electric power, and a switch circuit 22 for selectively supplying the electric power to any of the receiver circuit 13 , demodula tor 14 , modulator 18 and transmitter circuit 19 . The selection of the switch circuit 22 for the power supply depends on the contents of the specific information E14 .
