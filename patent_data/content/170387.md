# High speed motorized spindle with tool clamping unclamping mechanism.

## Abstract
A high speed motorized spindle is provided with a hollow tool driving shaft having tool clamping means slid ably disposed therein. A piston rod actuates the tool clamping means to slide in one direction to release a tool shank and spring means actuates the tool clamping means to slide in the other direction for gripping the tool shank when the piston rod is withdrawn. The piston rod actuates a collet clamp to clamp the tool driving shaft against movement from tool unclamping forces when the tool clamping means is slid in the direction to release the tool shank. The tool driving shaft is releasably oriented in a tool exchange position by a cam plate rotatable therewith being engaged by solenoid actuated cam lock member movably mounted in the housing.
