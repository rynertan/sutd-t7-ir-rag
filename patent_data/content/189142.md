The compounds of the present invention have potent activity in regulating the formation of lipoxygenease and as such possess therapeutic value in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and allergic responses such as anaphlaxis and asthma. Lipoxygenases ir....a. . .als have seen found in the lung, platelets, and white cells. They are enzymes capable of oxidizing arachidonic acid into hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids HPETSs and their stable products hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids HETEs . i oxygeneases are classified according to the position in the arachidonic acid which is oxygenated. Platelets metabolize arachidonic acid to 12 HETE, while polymorphonuclear leukocytes contain 5 and 15 lipoxygenases. It is known that 12 HETE and 5, 12 diHETE are chemotactic for human neutrophils and eosinophils, and rray augment the inflammation process. 5 H.PETE is known to be a precursor of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . The SRS family of molecules, such as leukotrienes B, C, and D, have been shown to be potent bronchoconstrictors see, NATURE 288, 484 486 1980 . The following protocol describes an assay to detect inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway. Such inhibitors are believed to be capable of modulating the biosynthesis of the leukotrienes, a property believed to be useful in treating asthma and inflammatory disease states. Protocol for Detecting Inhibitors of the LiDoxvaenase Pathway A suspension of rat neutrophils in bluffer is incubated for 3 minutes at 30 C with 14C arachidonic acid AA and Calcium lonophore A23187. Citric acid 2M is used to quench the reaction. Following the addition of a trace amount of H 5 HETE together with an excess of unlabeled 5 HETE to each tube, the mixture is extracted with chloroform methanol. The organic layer is washed with dilute acid and an aliquot is transferred to glass tubes and dried.The residue is dissolved in a small volume o chloroform and an aliquot is spotted on silica gel TLC sheets, which are developed with an ethyl acetate isooctane water acetic acid solvent system. The 5 HETE spots are visualized with iodine, cut out and placed in scintillation vials for counting.After adjusting for the extraction efficiency, the amount pmole of 14Ci 5 HETE in each of the tubes is cuantitated by substracting the net pmoles of 5 HETE in the tubes containing buffer alone blank from the moles of 5 HETE in the tubes containing buffer and cells control . The ability of the test compounds to modulate the activity of this enzyme is determined by a decrease or increase in the net amount of 5 HETE produced. Some compounds in this invention also display potent activities in regulating phospholipases and as such possess therapeutic value in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Inflammatory responses to a variety of offending stimuli are promoted by products of arachidonic acid metabolism. These products include leukotrienes SRS AI, prostaglandins, prostacyclin and its metabolites, and thromboxanes. No matter what combination of products results from passage of substrate down the branches of this complex cascade, the initial step involves the release o arachidonic acid from phospholipids or rom triglycerides containing this long chain fattv acid 1 The enzymes catalyzing such release o arachidonic acid are a phospholipase C followed by diglyceride lipase 2, b phospholipase A2, either soluble or membrane bound3,4 and c a lipase able to degrade triglycerides that contain arachidonic acidl.

Two assays have been developed to test the ability of the invented compounds on the activity of the phospholipases. In one protocol, a procedure is described for testing the inhibitory effects of these compounds onPhospholipase C PLC , while the other protocol describes a means for testing the inhibitory effect of these compounds onPhospholipase A2 PtA2 . Protocol for In Vitro Assay for Inhlbitors of Phospholipase The PLC employed in this screen is obtained by aggregation of purified rat platelets in the presence ofCaCl2 and ADP. In the enzyme assay, phosphatidylinositol having H labeled arachidonate resides at R2 is employed as substrate. PLC acts by cleaving the phosphate ester bond yielding diglyceride as follows EMI27.1 E Phosphatidylinositol H diglyceride Inositol cont. 4 Franson, R.C., D. Eisen, R. Jesse, and C.

Following completion of the reaction, the assay medium is acidified and extracted with hexane which takes up unreacted substrate and diglyceride. The hexane extract is passed over a short silica gel column which retains 99 of the phosphatidylinositol. The H labeled diglyceride is not retained 95 recovery in eluate and is collected directly in scintillation counting vials. The diglyceride is conveniently quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The compounds were tested at 300 uM in a buffer containing 0.06 m4 unlabeled phosphatidylcholine PC , 20 30,000 cpm of 14C PC , 150 mbI NaCl, 5 rnD1 CaCl2 and, 50 mSl Tris hydroxymethyl methylaminopropanesulfonic acid buffer, adjusted to pH 9.0 with 1N DJaOH. The temperature of the buffer is maintained at a temperature of 37 C. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme and it was terminated 10 minutes later by addition of 1 ml of 1 N HC1. Following acidification, the samples were extracted with 2 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 2 ml of hexane, vortexed and allowed to stand until the phrases separate. Free inositol and some unreacted substrate were taken up in the isopropanol saturated hexane. The hexane phase of the extraction mixture was transferred to a short silica gel column which retained unreacted phosphatidylinositol, but not 3 the H diglyceride. The column effluent was collected directly in scintillation vials. The columns were washed once with additional 2 ml of hexane. The radiolabeled diglycerides were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Protocol for In Vitro Assay for Inhibitors of PhosDholipase An Assayed at pH 7.0 PLA The PLA2 employed in this screen is obtained by aggregation of purified rat platelets. In the enzyme assay phosphatidylcholine having 14C labeled palmitate residues at R1 and R2 is employed as substrate. PLA2 acts by cleaving the R2 fatty acid ester bond yielding free fatty acid and lysophosphatidyl choline as follows EMI29.1 14C Phosphatidyl 14C Lysophosphatidyl 14C Palmitic choline choline acid Following completion of the reaction, the assay medium is acidified and extracted with hexane, which takes up unreacted substrate and free fatty acid product. The hexane extract is passed over a short silica gel column which retains 99 of the phosphatidyl choline.The 14C labeled palmitic acid is not retained 90 recovery in eluate and is collected directly in scintillation counting vials. The released palmitic acid is conveniently quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The compounds were tested at 100 uM in a buffer containing 0.3 mM unlabeled phosphatidylcholine PC , 20 30,000 cpm of C PC0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaC12 and 50 mM Tris HCL adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 N aOH. This resulted in a buffer at pH 7.2 The temperature of the buffer is maintained at a temperature of 37 C. The reaction was initiated by addition of te enzyme and it was terminated 30 minutes later by the additIon of 100 1 of 1 N HCL. Following acidification, the complex was extracted with 2 ml of 2 propanol and 2 ml of hexane, vortexed, and allowed to stand until the phases separated. Free fatty acids FFA and some unreacted substrate were taken up in the isopropanol saturated hexane. The hexane phase of the extraction mixture was transferred to a short silica gel column which retained unreacted PC but not the FFA. The column effluent was collected directly in scintillation vials. The columns were washed once with an additional 2 ml of hexane. The radiolabeled FFA were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
