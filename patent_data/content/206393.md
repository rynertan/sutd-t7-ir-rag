## Description
The invention relates to a luminescent screen provided with a luminescent layer which is formed on a carrier and comprises a luminescent silicate having an apatite crystal structure. The invention further relates to a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp provided with such a luminescent screen. The Netherlands Patent Application 8006223 PHN 9879 laid open to public inspection discloses luminescent screens comprising luminescent silicates of an alkaline earth metal and of a rare earth metal, these silicates having the hexagonal apatite crystal structure and corresponding to the general formula Me The element terbium is a frequently used activator for luminescent materials because it gives rise in many crystal lattices to a very efficient luminescence, in which the characteristic green Tb The invention has for its object to provide luminescent screens comprising new luminescent materials and more particularly materials which are activated by terbium and which can be directly excited in the terbium. According to the invention, a luminescent screen of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the silicate corresponds to the formula Ln It has been found that nitrogencontaining silicate apatites on the basis of the lattice Ln₁₀ siO₄ ₆N₂ where Ln represents the elements Y, La and or Gd, form luminescent materials upon a suitable activation. Materials having a very efficient luminescence upon excitation especially by ultraviolet radiation are obtained with the activator elements terbium and zirconium, which are substituted at Ln sites. The apatite fundamental latti ces Ln SiO₄ ₆N₂ are known It has been found that in these lattices the Ln can be partly replaced by one or more of the elements Mg, Ca and Sr and the Si can be partly replaced by A1 and or B, whilst the apatite crystal structure remains unchanged. With both substitutions, the same molar quantity of N has to be replaced by O in order to obtain a charge compensation. It has been found that a continuous sequence of compounds with decreasing nitrogen content is possible between the compound Ln₁₀ SiO₄ ₆N₂ and the compounds only containing oxygen Ln₈M It appears from the aforementioned formula and conditions for the luminescent silicates of lumines cent screens according to the invention that at most 1.9 mol of the Ln can be replaced by Mg, Ca and or Sr x 1.9 and also at most 1.9 mol of the SiO₄ can be replaced by AlO₄ and or BO₄ y 1.9 . If at the same time substitutions of both Ln and SiO₄ take place, these substitutions altogether are also at most 1.9 x y 1.9 . In fact it is necessary that the luminescent silicate contains a minimum quantity of nitrogen 0.1 mol of N per mol of silicate . Upon activation by only Tb q 0 , the terbium content Upon activation by zirconium, the optimum results are obtained if yttrium is chosen for Ln. Therefore, luminescent screens are preferred which are characterized in that Ln is yttrium and p 0. Upon activation by terbium, it is advantageous to use silicates in which lanthanum ischosen for Ln. These luminescent silicates in fact have a high quantum efficiency and a very high absorption of the excitating radiation, especially when used in low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps, as a result of which high luminous fluxes can be obtained. A partial substitution of Ln by M With such screens the optimum results are obtained if in the silicate lanthanum, which is replaced in part by gadolinium is chosen for Ln. These terbium activated silicates in fact have the highest quantum efficiency. A preferred embodiment of a luminescent screen according to the invention is therefore characterized in that the silicate corresponds to the formula La An advantageous application of the luminescent screens is found in low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps because in these lamps the luminescent silicates are excited to the optimum. The maximum of the excitation spectrum of the silicates in fact can be adequately adapted by a suitable choice of the O to N ratio to the 254 nm radiation produced in these lamps. The luminescent silicates can be obtained by a solid state reaction at a high temperature of a mixture of starting materials formed from oxides of the constituent elements or from compounds yielding these oxides upon an increase in temperature. The nitrogen is mostly added to the mixture as Si₃N₄, wherein in general an excess of nitrogen, for example, of a few tens of mol. , is used. Likewise a small excess of silicon, for example of about 10 mol. , can be used to favour the procedure of the solid state reaction. The mixture is heated once or several times at a temperature of 1200 to 1700 C in a weakly reducing atmosphere, the luminescent silicate thus being formed. Embodiments ofthe luminescent silicates suitable for a luminescent screen according to the invention will now be described more fully with reference to a drawing, an example of preparation and a number of measurements. In the drawing Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically and in sectional view a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp provided with a tubular glass wall 1. At the ends of the lamp there are arranged electrodes 2 and 3, between which the discharge is maintained during operation. The lamp is provided with a small quantity of mercury and with a rare gas as a starting gas. The wall 1 constitutes the carrier for a luminescent screen and is provided at the inner surface with a luminescent layer 4, which comprises a lumi nescent silicate according to the invention. The layer 4 can be applied to the wall 1 in a usual manner, for example by means of a suspension comprising the luminescent silicate. A mixture was made of 0.648 g of CaCO₃ 5.847 g of Y₂O₃ 1.672 g of SiO₂ 0.636 g of Si₃N₄ 2.086 g of ZrOC12.8H₂O. This mixture was heated in a crucible of Al₂O₃ for one hour at 1300 C in a closed furnace, through which was passed a flow 5 l min of nitrogen containing 5 by volume of hydrogen. After cooling and pulverization, the product obtained was heated once more for one hour at 1400 C in the same atmosphere. After cooling and homoge nization, a zirconium activated silicate was obtained according to the formula ZrCaY₈ SiO₄ ₆N₂. It was shown by X ray diffraction analysis that this silicate like all following examples of lumines cent silicates according to the invention had the apatite crystal structure. Upon excitation by short wave ultra violet radiation mainly 254 nm , the silicate showed a blue emission in a band having a maximum at about 425 nm and a half value width of about 105 nm. The spectral energy distribution of this emission is shown in Fig. 2. In this Figure, the wavelength λ in nm is plotted on the abscissa and the relative radiation intensity E in arbitrary units is plotted on the ordinate. The silicate had a quantum efficiency of 47 , while the absorption of the exciting 254 nm radiation was 75 . In a manner similar to that described in Example 1, a number of terbium activated luminescent silicates of different compositions were prepared. The required terbium was added to the starting mixture as Tb₄O₇. The formulae of these silicates and the results of the measurement of the quantum efficiency QE in upon excitation by 254 nm radiation and the absorption A in of the exciting radiation are indicated in the following Table. The emission of these silicates is the characteristic Tb 1 The maximum of the excitation spectrum of the silicates according to Example 3 La₉Tb SiO₄ ₆N₂ and according to Example 13 La₉Tb SiO₄ ₅ BO₄ ON and of the silicate only containing oxygen not in accordance with the invention La₉Tb SiO₄ ₄ BO₄ ₂O₂ is found at 257, 240 and 236 nm, respectively.
