# Apparatus for reacting or dissolving a particulate solid and a liquid apparatus and process for the production of phosphoric acid.

## Abstract
Apparatus which is especially suitable for use in production of phosphoric acid comprises a closed vessel 16 including a draft tube 20 mounted vertically within the vessel. A feed slurry is introduced via an inlet 12 which is provided with a vent pipe 5 for venting gases from the vessel during reaction therein, thereby reducing foaming and preventing blockage of the inlet. The vessel may form part of a multi vessel system for production of phosphoric acid.
