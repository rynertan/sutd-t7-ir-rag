# Fiber reinforced metal type composite material with magnesium containing aluminium based alloy as matrix metal.

## Abstract
A fiber reinforced metal type composite material is composed essentially of a mass of reinforcing fibers inti mately compounded with a matrix metal. The reinforcing fibers are either alumina fibers, carbon fibers, or a mixture thereof. The matrix metal is an alloy consisting essentially of between about 0.5 and about 4.5 magnesium, less than about 0.2 each of copper and titanium, less than about 0.5 each of silicon, zinc, iron, and manganese, and the remainder aluminum. Preferably the amount of magnesium is between about 0.7 and about 4.5 , and even more preferably it is between about 1.0 and about 4.0 .
