# CRANE WITH A MOVABLE WORK PLATFORM

## Abstract
The invention relates to a crane with a movable work platform for secure lifting of material and workers to a desired height for performing various types of construction work on structures higher than 2 meters, in order to avoid pipe scaffolding or suspended scaffolding encountered with construction work on external surfaces. The object to be solved by this invention is to provide a construction, which can easily be transported in a trailer of a passenger car, both in adequate dimensions and in its full weight, and can quickly be assembled, and will only minimally damage the structure during its erection. This object is solved by a construction consisting of at least one crane base 01 , and at least one support post 02 surrounded by a carriage 03 connected to a console supporting the work platform 04 with a protective fence 05 and of a lifting mechanism, connected to said carriage via steel cords over a recessed wheel secured to a support post rod, whereas the other end of the steel cord is also secured to the lifting mechanism and carries the work platform 04 over the console carriage, and whereas the crane is fitted along each support post 02 with an auxiliary crane 10 and with at least one positioning mechanism.
