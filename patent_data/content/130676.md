# Semiconductor device having a hetero junction.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device has two semiconductor layers 22, 23, 24 and 25 forming a heterojunction between them. The device has source and drain electrodes 31, 32 connected to high impurity concentration regions 29, 30 extending through the second semiconductor layer 25 to the first semiconductor layer 22, 23, 24 . A gate electrode 26 controls carriers between the source and drain electrodes 31, 32 . The first semiconductor layer has a low impurity concentration region 24 and at least one shielding region 23 containing an impurity of a conductivity type identical or opposite to that of the low and high impurity concen tration regions 24, 29, 30 . The shielding region 23 suppresses the spatial spread of the current between the electrodes 31, 32 and restrains bulging of equipotential lines from the drain to the source, hence suppressing a punch through current.
