# Pressure vessel.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a storage vessel for fluid under pressure. The use of a cylindrical vessel with generally semi spherical end walls is known. Such a vessel displays a number of disadvantages and limitations. The invention has for its object to provide a storage vessel for fluid under pressure engineered in such a way that it can be manufactured in a very cheap and relatively easy manner, whilst further its shape can be readily adapted to the shape of the available space. Thereto the invention proposes providing a storage vessel for fluid under pressure with at least one connecting element attached between to wall portions which is able to bear tensile stress. It is remarked that such a construction is not limited to flat pressure vessels, but lends itself to application in a much wider range of such vessels, for example parallelepipedal ves sels, cube shaped vessels, polygonal vessels, vessels with curved wall portions etc.
