# APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF MODIFYING AN EXTRUDED MATERIAL

## Abstract
Apparatus for colouring an extruded plastics material com prises motoring devices 2 and 3 for feeding colourant to an ex truded plastics material being fed to a diehead 1 . The col ourant is supplied at the diehead or between the diehead and the outlet from the extruder. The metering devices may be diaphragm pumps, gear pumps or reciprocating piston pumps. This arrangement requires fewer extruders and obviates pro blems resulting from balancing of different plastics material flows.
