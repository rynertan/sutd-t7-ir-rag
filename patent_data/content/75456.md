# Swivel castor.

## Abstract
A swivel castor comprises a pair of wheels 17 inclined inwardly to the upstanding swivel axis 11 , such that the bottom of the wheels are spaced apart further than the tops. The swivel axis is offset forwardly of the wheel rotational axes. The arrangement gives improved support capacity and swivellability.
