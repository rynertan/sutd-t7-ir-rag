# Sulfidization of compound semiconductor surfaces.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method of passivating mer cury cadmium telluride substrates 1 wherein a substrate surface is lapped and cleaned and then placed in an electro lyte solution 9 containing sulfide ions to eiectrolytically grow a sulfide passivating layer 11 on the lapped and cleaned surface. A preferred electrolyte solution 9 is formed with sodium sulfide, water and ethylene glycol.
