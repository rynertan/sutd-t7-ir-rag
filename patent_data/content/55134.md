# Hydrogen supply unit.

## Abstract
Hydrogen is generated by heating a metal surface 22 under water to a temperature at which the metal reacts with water to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen can then be used, for example, as a fuel for a motor vehicle engine or another type of engine. The heating can be done electrically providing an electrical discharge, under water, between the metal surface and another surface. Water and the metal surface are consumed.
