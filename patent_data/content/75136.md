# A process for recovering methyl tert butyl ether from a reaction effluent.

## Abstract
MTBE is recovered from an ether containing effluent by fractionation. When driers are not used on the hydrocarbon feed to MTBE manufacture, a separate water methanol phase occurs in the fractionation overhead which is separately processed in a methanol fractionator and the water recovered is used to water wash the separated hydro carbon phase from the overhead while methanol is recycled to MTBE and when driers are used on the hydrocarbon feed a separate methanol phase occurs in the fractionation over head which can be recycled to MTBE manufacture and the hydrocarbon phase is directly passed to a drier preceding alkylation.

## Description
A PROCESS FOR RECOVERING METHYL TERT BUTYL ETHER FROM A REACTION EFFLUENT Eield of the Invention This invention relates to the preparation of ethers. In accordance with another aspect, this invention relates to a process for the recovery of ethers especially methyl tert butyl ether MTBE . In accordance with a further aspect, this invention relates to an ether recovery system when driers are not used on the hydrocarbon feed toMTBE manufacture. In a further aspect, this invention relates to an ether recovery system when driers are used on the hydrocarbon feed toMTBE manufacture. In still another aspect, this invention relates to a combination process for the recovery of ethers and unreacted materials, the hydrocarbon portion of which can be passed to alkylation.Background of the Invention Methyltertiarybutyl ether NTBE is well known as a high octane blending component for motor fuels. The well known reaction of methanol MeOH and isobutylene, using an appropriate catalyst, such asAmberlyst 15, has been practiced to produce MTBE. Reference is had toU.S. patents 4,071,567 3,9Z9,461 3,135,807 3,846,088 among many others. 1w catalytic alkylation of isobutane with olefins, such as propylene and or butylenes, is also a well known process for producing high octane motor fuel. In HF alkylation it is also known that too much water in HF catalyst can adversely affect the alkylation operation, including presenting problems of equipment corrosion. In addition, methanol is not wanted to be present in HF alkylation since methanol uses isobutane in its reaction therewith to produce undesired low octane, high volatility five carbon atom hydrocarbons and water, the water undesiredly diluting the HF catalyst. Since there is some unreacted methanol and there is some unreacted isobutylene in the MTBE reactor effluent, it is desired to recover these components and to recycle the methanol, preferably, back to the MTBE reaction and to recover the unreacted isobutylene along with isobutane and straight chain butylenes, which hydrocarbons are present in the feed to MTBE and act as desired diluents in the MTBE reaction and charge this recovered isobutylene, freed from methanol, to the HE alkylation. It is desired that no methanol be yielded, and thereby lost, in the MTBE product. It is desired that substantially no water and no methanol be charged to the KE alkylation. This invention presents a system to produce MTBE from methanol and isobutylene with the MTBE being recovered free of methanol and water to recover methanol and unreacted hydrocarbons to separate a water and methanol phase from the unreacted hydrocarbons to water wash the unreacted hydrocarbons to remove the last traces of methanol therefrom and to dry these water washed hydrocarbons prior to charging the methanol free, water free hydrocarbons to HE alkylation to fractionate the water methanol phase, above referred to, to recover substantially pure methanol which can be recycled to MTBE manufacture and to use the water separated from the methanol as at least part of the water used in the water wash step, above referred to.Objects Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing and recovering ethers Another object of this invention is to recover unreacted materials for recycle following an ether reaction. A further object of this invention is to recover unreacted hydrocarbons in an ether effluent for further use in an alkylation process Other objects, aspects, as well as the several advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification, the drawing and the appended claims. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the invention the reaction effluent from a methyl tert butyl ether MTBE reaction containing MTBE, unreacted C4 hydrocarbons, alcohol, and water, if any, is fractionated to yield an overhead containing C4 hydrocarbons, alcohol, and water, and a bottoms product comprising MTBE, condensing and phase separating the condensed overhead into a hydrocarbon phase and an alcohol phase. The alcohol phase, e.g., methanol, is recycled to the MTBE reaction or passed to a fractionation zone to remove water if water content is excessive. A portion of the hydrocarbon phase, e.g., butenes, is recycled as reflux to the fractionation and the remainder is water washed, if necessary, to remove alcohol, e.g., methanol, and passed to alkylation.Description of the Invention When driers are not used on the hydrocarbon feed to MTBE manufacture, a separate water methanol phase can occur in the MTBE fractionator overhead accumulator. This heavier aqueous phase cannot be recycled to the MTBE fractionator because the bottom product MTBE will be then contaminated with methanol and water. This aqueous phase is separately processed in a methanol fractionator to recover methanol for recycle to MTBE and to recover a water stream used to water wash the separate hydrocarbon phase from this overhead accumulator to remove the methanol therefrom. When driers are used on the hydrocarbon feed to MTBE manufacture, with sufficient methanol in the feed charged to the MTBE fractionator, a separate methanol phase can occur in the MTBE fractionator overhead accumulator. This methanol liquid phase cannot be recycled to this fractionator because it will allow methanol to be in the bottom MTBE product, contaminating the MTBE, and causing a recovery problem or loss of methanol. This liquid methanol phase from the accumulator can be passed back to the MTBE manufacturing step.The separate accumulator hydrocarbon phase liquid containing methanol can by pass the water wash column and can be charged to the feed driers for KF alkylation, wherein the methanol is adsorbed, yielding methanol free hydrocarbons also water free because of the feed driers on the charge to MTBE manufacture which.are charged to KF alkylation. A portion of the hydrocarbon product from the on stream drier can be heated and vaporized, and used to desorb methanol from that drier on regeneration. The vaporous effluent from this regeneration is condensed and phase separated, with the methanol phase being recycled to MTBE manufacture, and the hydrocarbon phase being recycled to the on stream drier. In this operation, both the water wash column and the methanol fractionator can be by passed. When MTBE feed driers are used and when insufficient methanol is present in the MTBE reactor effluent to form a separate liquid phase in the MTBE fractionator overhead accumulator, the yield frcm the accumulator is charged to the RE alkylation feed driers, as described hereinabove, by passing the water wash column Also, the methanol fractionation is not needed for this operation. It is pointed out that when driers are not used on the feed to MTBE and when the methanol water phase occurs in the MTBE fractionator overhead accumulator, that the hydrocarbon phase has both water and methanol therein, and after water washing this stream, the washed hydrocarbon is passed to the HE alkylation feed driers. The drier on regeneration can use heated, vaporized dried hydrocarbon for regeneration, and the vapor effluent, hydrocarbon and water, with a trace of methanol, is passed via condensing to a phase separator. The hydrocarbon phase from this accumulator or separator is returned to that drier on the drying cycle, and the aqueous phase is charged to the methanol fractionator, recovering methanol for recycle to the MTBE manufacture. Given the foregoing description, one skilled in the art having studied the same can determine by mere routine testing the design and conditions of operation required to carry out the invention. However, to more fully describe the invention and to set forth a now best mode contemplated for it in its application to the recovery of the effluent from an ether operation reference is had to the drawing. Referring now to the drawing, and operating without driers on the hydrocarbon feed to MTBE manufacture, hydrocarbon feed 10, comprising reactant isobutylene and non reactant, or diluent, isobutane, straight chain butylenes, and normal butane from the field, as from a catalytic cracking operation, is admixed with methanol feed 9 and recycle 19 added via. 11, and the mass is passed via heater 15 toMTBE reactor 20 containing Amberlyst 15 catalyst or other suitable catalyst. Effluent 21 from reactor 20 is pumped 22 via indirect heater 23 and conduit 24 into the second reactor 30, also containing Amberlyst 15 catalyst. Effluent 31 from reactor 30 is indirectly heated at 32 and passed via conduit 33 to reboiled and refluxed MTBE fractionator 40.MTBE product, substantially free of methanol, is recovered at 12 for use, for example, as a high octane blending component in motor fuel.The overhead vapor stream 41 from fractionator 40 is indirectly cooled and substantially all condensed in 42 and passed via 43 to accumulator 70. Inerts can be removed from accumulator 70 via conduit 77. In accumulator 70 two liquid phases are formed. The lower liquid phase comprises water and unreacted methanol. The upper liquid phase comprises unreacted hydrocarbons and contains some water and unreacted methanol. The lower liquid phase is passed via conduit 13 and indirect heater 65 to methanol fractionator 60 as part of the feed thereto. The upper hydrocarbon phase from accumulator 70 in part refluxes column 40 via conduit 71, and the yield portion of hydrocarbon phase is passed via conduit 14 and indirect cooler 72 to water wash column 50 wherein the liquid hydrocarbon containing some methanol is washed with liquid water added to the wash column 50 via conduit 51. Water, containing substantially no methanol, from methanol fractionator 60 is passed via conduit 51 and is pumped via indirect cooler 52 to water wash column 50. Makeup water can be added at conduit 53. Yield water can be removed at conduit 54. Water containing methanol is passed from column 50 via conduit 55 into methanol fractionator 60 along with the material in conduit 13. Hydrocarbon, substantially freed of methanol but containing solution water which will also contain some methanol , is recovered at conduit 16 and passed to the HF alkylation feed drier 90 which is on the drying cycle. The dried, methanol free hydrocarbon is charged via conduit 91 to an HF alkylation, not shown, to effect alkylation of isobutane with propylene and or butylenes, some of which olefins are present in stream 91. Outside isobutane and propylene and or butylenes can also be charged to the HF alkylation. Drier 92 is on the regeneration cycle, preferably using as regeneration fluid a portion of the dried hydrocarbon from drier 90 passed via indirect heater vaporizer 94 and conduit 95 through drier 92 for regeneration. Vaporous effluent 96 from drier 92 is condensed in exchanger 91 and passed to liquid phase separator 98. The lower aqueous phase methanol and water is pumped passed via conduit 99 to the methanol fractionator 60 for recovery of methanol for recycle toMTBE manufacture. The hydrocarbon phase is recycled via conduit 101 and conduit 16 to drier 90 on the hydrocarbon drying cycle. The overhead vaporous methanol from methanol fractionator 60 is condensed in indirect heat exchange condenser 61 and is passed via conduit 62 to overhead accumulator. 63. Liquid methanol refluxes fractionator 60 via 64 and the yield methanol portion is passed via conduits 66 and 19 back to MTBE manufacture. Inerts can be vented from accumulator 63 via conduit 67. When MTBE hydrocarbon feed drier 100 is used, and the dried hydrocarbon 101 is charged to MTBE manufacture, and when sufficient excess methanol is in the reactor effluent, the lower liquid phase formed in accumulator 70 is substantially only methanol. This methanol can be passed via conduits 102 and 19 for recycle to the MTBE manufacture. It is not recylced to fractionator 40 since this would cause methanol to go out with MTBE product. The upper hydrocarbon phase containing some methanol to be yielded is passed via conduit 14, via conduit 104, and via conduit 16 to the on stream drier 90 to remove the last traces of methanol from the hydrocarbon. On regeneration of the spent drier 92, the dried hydrocarbon from the on stream drier 90 is passed via indirect heater vaporizer 94 through direr 92 for regeneration thereof.Vaporous effluent from drier 92 is condensed in indirect exchanger 91 and is passed to liquid phase separator 98. The lower methanol phase is recycled via conduits 99, 105, and 19 to MTBE manufacture. The upper hydrocarbon phase is returned via conduits 101 and 16 to drier 90, as illustrated in the drawing. When there is insufficient methanol in the feed 33 to theMTBE fractionator, there is no separate methanol phase formed in the overhead accumulator, and, of course, there need be no flow from the leg of accumulator 10 via conduit 13. The hydrocarbon phase containing methanol in solution this is the operation using drier 100 , this stream is used as reflux 71, in part, and yielded via conduits 14, 104, and 16 to drier 90 for removal of the soluble methanol therefrom. It is pointed out that fractionator 40 is operated so that substantially no methanol exits the bottom thereof along with product MTBE, but that the methanol azeotropes overhead with the light hydrocarbons. Pressures and temperatures other than the specific temperatures and pressures tabulated can be selected by those skilled in this fractionation art. This fractionator 40 is refluxed with separated liquid hydrocarbon, and not ever with the water methanol phase, which latter stream would cause methanol and water to exit in part in the MTBE, and then this MTBE stream would have to be treated for water and methanol removal and recovery of methanol. The driers can use conventional molecular sieve 5A, 13X, or the like. Activated alumina can also be used as the desiccant, as is known in the art. Conventional conditions for drying and regeneration are employed in the driers. Not all of the valves, pumps, heat exchangers, and control systems are shown on the drawing in order to simplify the drawing.Pertinent controls, valves, exchangers, etc. are illustrated, however.
