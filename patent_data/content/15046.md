# Optical waveguide connector.

## Abstract
An optical waveguide connector comprises a connector body 44 supporting three rods 48,50,52 engaging to define an interstitial space 58 for receiving a waveguide 54 . Two of the rods 46,48 have larger diameters than the third 52 which projects forwardly at a mating face of the connector, one 48 of the other rods 48,50 terminating intermediate the forward end of the other 50 and that of the smaller diameter rod 50 .
