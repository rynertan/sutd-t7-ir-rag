# A method of and a system for remote control of electronic equipments.

## Abstract
For invention relates to a method of and a system for re mote control of individual electronic equipments R , which are spread out across a large geographical area. In partic ular it concerns activation of radio transmitters spread over the water surface and cooperating with hydrophones for taking up sound waves from submarines in order to localize these sub marines. In order to achieve selective activation of the electronic equipments, electromagnetic waves or sound waves are transmitted with given relative time posi tions from at least three fixed stations I, II, III having known geographical positions. In each electronic equipment the waves are received and compared as regards their relative time positions at reception, activation of an equipment tak ing place only if a given criterion as regards said mutual time positions is fulfilled. Hereby activation of equipments will take place only within a given small zone of said large area. The position of said small zone is determined by the relative time positions of the transmitted waves, which can be varied in order to select different zones.
