We have now discovered a class of compounds which have useful pharmocological activity and which are structurally distinct from the compounds disclosed inOffenlegungsschrift No. 2724948. This class of compounds of this invention is structurally distinct from the compounds of formula B EMI2.1 wherein X is O to S n is 1 to 8 R1 is hydrogen, or C02R1 represents an ester group in which the R1 moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms is is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, or phenyl R3 is hydroxy or protected hydroxy R4 is hydrogen, C1 9 alkyl, C3 8 cycloalkyl, C3 8 cycloalkyl Cl 6 alkyl, phenyl, phenyl C1 6 alkyl, naphthyl, naphthyl Cl 6 alkyl, any of which phenyl or naphthyl moieties may be substituted by one or more halogen, trifluoromethyl, C1 6 alkyl, hydroxy, C1 6 alkoxy, phenyl C16 alkoxy or nitro groups or R2 and R4 taken with the carbon atom to which they are joined represent a C58 cycloalkyl groups is is hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, C1 6 alkyl substituted by a nitro, hydroxy, C1 6 alkoxy, CO2A, CO2A 2, CN or halogen group, C5 8 cycloalkyl, phenyl, phenyl Cl 6 alkyl, phenyl C3 6 cycloalkyl, any of which phenyl moieties may be substituted by one or more halogen, trifluoromethyl, C1 6 alkyl, C1 6alkoxy or nitro groups or a group CO2A in R when present A is hydrogen or CO2A represents an ester group in which the A moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and salts thereof which are disclosed in our West German OffenlegungsschriftNo. 2755771 as having useful prostaglandin like activity.It should be noted that West German OffenlegungsscriftNo. 2755771 published after the date of filing of the priority application for this invention. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI3.1 wherein X is O or S Y is CH CH or C C n is 1 to 5 R1 is hydrogen or C02R1 represents an ester group in which the R1 moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms is is hydrogen or C14 alkyl R3 is hydroxy or protected hydroxy R4 is C19 alkyl, C3 8 cycloalkyl or C38 cycloalkyl C1 6 alkyl or R2 and R4 taken with the carbon atom to which they are joined represent a C5 8 cycloalkyl group and R5 is C16 alkyl substituted by one nitro, hydroxy, C1 6 alkoxy, CO2A, CO2A2, CN or halogen group C5 8 cycloalkyl orC02A in R5 when present A is hydrogen or CO2A represents an ester group in which the A moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and salts thereof. Suitable examples of R1 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, n , sec and tert butyl, phenyl, benzyl, tolyl and the like, while normally hydrogen or C16 alkyl groups are preferred. Suitable examples of R2 include hydrogen, methyl and ethyl. More suitably R2 is hydrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. Suitable protected hydroxyl groups R3 include readily hydrolysable groups such as acylated hydroxy groups in which the acyl moiety contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example the acetoxy group and hydroxy groups etherified by readily removable inert groups such as the benzyl group or like groups. PreferablyR3 is hydroxyl. Suitable groups R4 when R4 is an alkyl group include C49 alkyl groups. Such C49 alkyl groups may be straight chain alkyl groups, such as n butyl, n pentyl, n hexyl and n heptyl, or may be alkyl groups branched by one or two methyl groups at the same or different carbon atoms . Thus for example, R4 may be a group CH2R7, CH CH3 R7 or C CH3 2R7, wherein R7 is a straight chain alkyl group such that the carbon content of the resultant group R4 is 4 to 9. In general preferred groups R4 when R4 is an alkyl group include straight chain pentyl, hexyl and heptyl groups. Of these straight chain hexyl is often the most useful. Other preferred groups R4 include groups CH CH3 R7 andC CH3 2R7 wherein R7 is straight chain butyl, pentyl and hexyl. Other suitable examples of R4 when R4 is an alkyl group include the lower alkyl groups, that is when R4 is a 1 4 alkyl group. When R4 is or contains a C38 cycloalkyl moiety, the moiety may be cyclopropyl. The moiety may also be a C58 cycloalkyl moiety such as a cyclohexyl moiety.Examples of suitable C16 alkyl moieties when R4 is a C3 8 cycloalkyl C16 alkyl group include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl. Also R2 and R4 taken with the carbon atom to which they are joined can represent a C58 c ycloalkyl group, such as the cyclohexyl group. When P5 is a C 1 6 alkyl group substituted by a nitro, hydroxy, C1 6 alkoxy such as methoxy , C02A, C02A 2, CN or halogen, often R5 will be a methylene group thus substituted. When R5 is, or contains, a group C02A, suitable examples of A include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl, n , sec and tert butyl, phenyl, benzyl, toluyl and the like, while normally for A hydrogen or C16 alkyl are preferred. When P5 is C58 cycloalkyl, it is suitably cyclohexyl. Preferred P5 groups include C16 alkyl substituted by CN, such as CH2CN. Suitably n is 2 to 4, preferably 3. The compounds of the formula I may form conventional salts. Such salts include those with alkali and alkaline earth metals, suitably sodium and potassium, and ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Form the aforesaid it will be seen that one particularly suitable group of compounds within formula I is of formula II EMI6.1 wherein X, Y, P and R5 are as defined in formula I P1 is 1 5 hydrogen, methyl or ethyl R4 is C19 alkyl and salts thereof. In formula II suitably X is 0. R2 is more suitably hydrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. While R4 may be a C19 alkyl group, it is normally a C49 alkyl group. In such cases suitable and preferred straight chain and branched groups R4 include those previously described as suitable and preferred for the group R4 when R4 is a C4 9 alkyl group. Such preferred groups R4 include straight chain pentyl, hexyl, and heptyl and of these normally the most useful is straight chain hexyl. Other preferred groups R4 include CH CH3 R7 and C CH3 2R17 wherein R17 is straight chain butyl, pentyl or hexyl. Suitable and preferred values for X, Y, R1 and R5 are as described hereinbefore. A further group of compounds within formula I of interest is of formula III EMI7.1 wherein X, Y, R1 and P5 are as defined in formula I R12 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl P4 is a group of formula IV EMI7.2 wherein T is a bond, or a C16 alkylene group which may be straight chain or branched by one or two methyl groups at the same or different carbon atoms and r is O to 3 and salts thereof. In formula III suitably X is 0. R12 is more suitably hydrogen or methyl, preferably methyl. In formula IV often T will be a group CH2 q wherein q is O to 4. Also suitably r is 1. It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula I have asymmetric centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I , which process comprises the cyclisation of a compound of formula V EMI8.1 wherein the variable groups are as defined and thereafter if desired or necessary converting Y, R1 or R3 in the thus formed compound into other variablesY, R1 or R3. The compound of the formula V is conveniently prepared in situ during the reaction of a compound of the formula VI EMI8.2 wherein n, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined, withR5NCX, a preferred process of the invention. The preferred process is suitably carried out under reflux in an inert solvent such as benzene or the like. It should be stated that when in this reaction R5is asterically hindered group then this reaction may proceed only as far as the uncyclised compound of formula V in which case the necessary cyclisation of the compound V can be achieved with a strong base, such as sodium hydride or sodium ethoxide, in a dry garri solvent. Sodium ethoxide in benzene, or potassium tbutoxide in toluene, benzene, or hexamethylphosphoramide are suitable reagents. The present invention also provides a further process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I , which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula VII EMI9.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula I , withR5L wherein R5 is as defined in formula I and L is a good leaving group. In such reactions it may be necessary to convert the compound of the formula VII first to an alkali metal salt at the 10 position prostaglandin numbering . This reacton is carried out under conventional conditions for substitution reactions. L may suitably be a halide. Compounds of the formula VII may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula VI as defined with a salt M NX, wherein is a metal ion, in the presence of acid. In this reaction the necessarv acid may conven iently be provided by using an acid addition salt of the compound of formula VI , such as the hydrochloride, or by carrying out the reaction in aqueous acid. The subsequent conversion of a compound of the formula I to another compound of the formula I wherein Y, R1 or R3 are altered, when desired or necessary, may be achieved in conventional manner. For example, if desired, compounds wherein Y is C C may be reduced to compounds wherein Y is CH CHin known manner. Suitably this reaction is carried out using catalytic hydrogenation, such as Lindlar catalysis. Also if desired the group R1 in the compound may be varied by conventional esterification and or de esterification reactions. Similarly, protected R3 hydroxy moieties may be deprotected in conventional manner. For example when R3 is a benxyloxy group, the benzyl group may readily be removed by acidic hydrolysis. Thus it may be seen that protected hydroxy compounds of the formula I are useful intermediates in the preparation of the corresponding free hydroxy1 compounds of the formula I . Also when a compound of the formula I contains an acidic hydrogen atom, a salt thereof may be prepared in conventional manner for example by reacting the compound of the formula I with the required base. The compounds of formula VI are known compounds, or may be prepared in analogous manner to known compounds. One suitable process form the pPeparation of a compound of formula VI. comprises reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI11.1 with a compound of formula IX EMI11.2 This reaction is suitably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as hexamethylphosphoramide orN,N dimethylformamide, at room temperature, in the presence of a base, such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydride, and a source of alkali metal ions, such as an alkali metal halide. Suitable alkali halides include sodium iodide and lithium iodide. The compounds of formula VIII may suitably be prepared by cleavage of a compound of formula X EMI11.3 Suitably this cleavage is carried out with mild acid catalysis, for example by chromatography on acid washed silica gel These compounds of formula X can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula XI EMI12.1 with a compound of formula XII L CH2 Y CH2 nC02R in normal manner for such alkylation reactions. Compounds within the formula I have particularly useful pharmacological activity. For example compounds within the formula I have anti gastric secretion activity, anti ulcer activity, cardiovascular activity e.g. anti hypertensive activity, platelet aggregation inhibition activity, affect the respiratory tract, e.g. bronchodilator activity, and have antifertility, smooth muscle and anti arrhythmic activity.Compounds of the formula I may accordingly be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of corresponding disorders in humans and animals. In general it may be said that compounds within the formula I have a range of pharmacological activities similar to those shown by the natural prostaglandins, but that these activities tend to be rather more selective. The compounds of the formula I are especially useful as bronchdilation agents. The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the formula I also have good stability. Clearly the formulation of the said pharmaceutical composition will depend on the nature of the activity shown by the chosen compound of the formula I , and on other factors such as a preference in a particular area of therapy for a particular mode of adminstration. The composition may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wetting agents and the like. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstiturion with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents, and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle.Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. When appropriate, the compositions of this invention may be presented as aerosol for oral administration, or as a microfine powder for insufflation. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound of the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention also provides a method of treatment and or prophylaxis of disorders in human being or animals which comprises the administration to the sufferer of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I .Normally however the compounds will be used in the.therapy of human disorders.
