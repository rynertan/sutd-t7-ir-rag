# Low leakage integrator and carburator control system comprising this integrator.

## Abstract
A low leakage integrator 15 used in a carburetor feedback control system is disclosed. The integrator com prises an operational amplifier 47 having a feedback capacitor 51 coupled between its output 52 and its in verting input terminal 46. Input voltages are coupled through a resistor 41 to the inverting input terminal 46 and a pair of controllable gates 43, 44 are utilized to implement an integrate and hold mode of operation for the integrator while minimizing the drift of the integrator output due to leakage currents during the hold mode of the integrator. The carburetor control system utilizes the above integrator in combination with a fuel mixture sensor 11 and an engine position sensor 21 to produce an output voltage related to the sensed fuel mixture. This output voltage is utilized to control a solenoid 12 that adjusts the setting of a carburetor valve to thereby alter the carburetor fuel mixture as desired.
