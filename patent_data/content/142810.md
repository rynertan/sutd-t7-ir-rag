## Description
The present invention relates generally to the Water insoluble polymers such as polysaccharides and polyacrylics have been commonly used in the fields of biochemistry and immunology affinity chromotography and immunoassays , as solid phase supports with passively absorbed or covalently linked antibodies. Such water insoluble polymers are formed by polymerization of compounds, such as monomers or oligomers, to form larger polymeric molecular structures polymers , or the initiation of copolymerization of monomers with polymerizable polyunsaturated compounds. Polymers may be formed from a single monomeric species homopolymers , from a mixture of different monomers copolymers , from polymerizable polyunsaturated compounds containing olefinic or acetylenic unsaturation, or from a mixture of polymerizable polyunsaturated compounds, and one or more monomers. Linear, branched, or cross linked structures are possible. By varying the chemical composition or ratios of the monomers, it is possible to form either soluble or insoluble polymers which comprise a broad range of chemical and physical structures. For example, water soluble monomers such as acrylamide can be copolymerized to form water soluble homopolymers. They can also be copolymerized with less water soluble monomers such as N alkyl or N, N dialkyl acrylamides or with cross linking monomers such as N, N methylenebisacrylamide to form water insoluble copolymer structures. Some water soluble monomers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate or acrylonitrile can be homopolymerized to form water insoluble homopolymers. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,957,741 4,257,884 4,195,129 4,225,784 4,181,636 4,401,765 and 4,166,105. To date, the documented coupling of a polypeptide to a polymer has generally occurred under circumstances in which the polypeptide was provided in soluble form and the polymer was provided as a preformed soluble or preformed insoluble material. While these polymers are of utility in providing a surface upon which selective biochemical or immunological reactions can occur, the polymers are of limited value in that the spacing, steric accessibility, and number of polypeptides bound per unit length of polymer cannot be precisely or reproducibly controlled. Lot to lot variation is commonly encountered during the manufacture of such solid phase polymer reactant matrices. In certain end use applications where reproducibility and standarization are essential e.g. immunoassays , this variation in composition of the solid phase polymer reactant matrices presents a critical problem. Consequently, there is a need in the art for a method to specifically tailor or molecularly engineer polymer compounds incorporating controlled quantities of reactants. In GB A 1 411 386 a process is disclosed for the preparation of an immobilised enzyme composite, which process comprises the steps of reacting a hydroxy containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer with a cyanogen halide reacting the monomer cyanogen halide with an aqueous solution of enzyme to form an adduct and polymerising the monomer enzyme adduct. In US A 2 853 457 polymeric hydrosols composed of an unsaturated acid derivative of a protein and a combination of unsaturated monomers are disclosed. The unsaturated acid derivatives include maleyl, acrylyl and methacrylyl proteins. Immunoassays have found widespread application in the field of clinical diagnostics for the detection and measurement of drugs, vitamins, hormones, proteins, metabolites, microorganisms, and other substances of interest analytes in biological and nonbiological fluids. Typically, these analytes occur in micromolar 16 ⁶ M or less concentration. Immunoassays generally incorporate antibodies and antigens as reactants, at least one of which is labeled with a signal producing compound e.g. radioisotope, fluorophore . Following mixture with the sample and incubation, specific antibody antigen reactions occur specific binding . The reaction mixture is subsequently interrogated to detect free and specifically bound labeled reactant, enabling a measurement of the analyte in the sample. Immunoassays can be divided into two general categories, homogeneous and heterogenous. In a homogeneous immunoassay, the signal emitted by the specifically bound labeled reactant is different from the signal emitted by the free labeled reactant. Hence, bound and free can be distinguished without physical separation. The archetypal homogeneous immunoassay is the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique EMIT , which is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,817,837. In this technology, analyte present in patient sample and analyte enzyme conjugate compete for a limited amount of anti analyte antibody. Specific binding of antibody to the conjugate modulates its enzymatic activity. Hence, the amount of enzyme activity is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Homogeneous immunoassays have the advantage of being rapid, easy to perform, and readily amenable to automation. Their principal disadvantages are that they are relatively prone to interferences, are generally limited to low molecular weight analytes and are generally limited in sensitivity to approximately 10 ⁹ M. In a heterogeneous immunoassay, the signal emitted by the bound labeled reactant is indistinguishable from the signal emitted by the free labeled reactant. Therefore, a separation step is required to distinguish between the two. Typical heterogeneous immunoassays include the radioiminunoassay RIA and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . In the RIA, radiolabeled analyte and analyte present in patient sample compete for a limited amount of immobilized solid phase anti analyte antibody. The solid phase is washed to remove unbound labeled analyte and either the bound or the free fraction is analyzed for the presence of labeled reactant. ELISA assays are performed analogously. In this case, though, the signal is an enzyme instead of a radioisotope. Heterogeneous immunoassays typically employ at least one reagent immobilized on a solid phase. Since the kinetics of reaction between an immobilized antibody or antigen and its binding site tend to be slower than the kinetics of the same reaction occurring in solution, long incubation times are frequently required. When the multiple wash steps often needed are considered, it can be appreciated that heterogeneous assays tend to be time consuming and labor intensive. However, they are in general more sensitive than homogeneous assays and less prone to interferences, since interfering substances can be removed in the wash steps. Solids used to immobilize reactants in immunoassays have included controlled pore glass and preformed polymers such as polyvinyls, polyacrylamides, polydextrans and polystyrene. Numerous separation methods are known in the art and have been used in heterogeneous immunoassays. These include centrifugation, filtration, affinity chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, etc. The homogeneous immunoassay methods of the prior art are generally prone to interferences, are of limited sensitivity and have a limited range of antigen sizes. The heterogeneous immunoassays of the prior art, while increasing the sensitivity and minimizing interferences, tend to be time consuming and labor intensive. These difficulties generally arise from the added step of physical separation and the need for numerous washes to decrease background interference. There is a need in the art for an immunoassay method which is sensitive to sub micromolar concentrations of analyte which has fast reaction kinetics and which minimizes the number of manipulations necessary to achieve a result. One aspect of the invention is a method for the Another aspect of the invention relates to the selective removal of substances from solution by virtue of the ability of the substance to bind to antibodies which are a part of the conjugate. Following specific binding the conjugates are polymerized or copolymerized to remove the specifically bound substances from solution. Another aspect of the invention relates to bonding of polymerizable compounds to a solid whose surface is modified with the polymerizable compounds so that the polymerizable compounds can copolymerize with a polymerizable compound antibody conjugate. Another aspect of the invention relates to bonding of polymerization initiation compounds to a solid surface such that the surface acts as an initiator during polymerization or copolymerization of the conjugate. The present invention also provides an immunoassay method for determining the presence of an antigen or hapten in a fluid sample suspected of containing an antigen or hapten, comprising a contacting the fluid sample containing the antigen or hapten with a conjugate of a monomer and an antibody in order to form a polymerizable monomer antibody antigen or hapten complex and providing a reporter for labelling the polymerizable monomer antibody antigen or hapten complex b separating the labelled complex by initiating the polymerization of the complex and c detecting the incorporation of reporter into the polymerized complex. Another aspect of the invention provides immunoassay methods for simultaneously measuring two or more antigens or haptens in a fluid sample. Another aspect of the invention provides immunoassay methods utilizing monomer antigen or hapten conjugates for competitive immunoassays. A further aspect of the invention provides monomer antibody and monomer antigen or hapten conjugates for use in the immunoassays of the present invention. A novel feature of this immunoassay is the use of reactant antibody or antigen that is covalently linked with a polymerizable organic monomer. Following mixture and reaction of the immunoassay components, the monomer reactant conjugate and its specific binding complement i.e., its appropriate antigen or antibody counterpart bound through specific antibody antigen interactions can be rapidly and conveniently separated from solution by initiating a polymerization reaction. In contrast to the monomer reactant conjugate and its specifically bound complement, other components of the immunoassay remain in free solution. Thus, this method provides an effective single step separation of specifically bound and free reactants. The polymerization induced separation immunoassays of the instant invention offer several advantages over prior art homogeneous and heterogeneous immunoassay methods. Because of the separation achieved by polymerization of the monomer antibody conjugate, the immunoassay of this invention can achieve the sensitivity typical of state of the art heterogeneous techniques combined with the ease of performance of homogeneous techniques. The immunoassays of this invention can typically be performed in less time than traditional heterogeneous assays because binding reactions which would normally occur on a solid phase can be made to occur in solution instead. Also, the need for extensive washing of the solid phase can be eliminated. Sandwich immunoassays typically require elution of the specifically bound labeled reactant from the solid phase prior to measurement. This adds an extra step and makes even longer and more cumbersome an already long and tedious process. The immunoassay of this invention can be performed without the elution of the bound labeled reactant from the polymer, thus simplifying performance. One can molecularly engineer polymeric compounds incorporating controlled quantities of antibody for specific applications by first forming a conjugate of a polymerizable compound covalently bonded to an antibody, then polymerizing the conjugate with itself or copolymerizing the conjugate with predetermined amounts of nonderivatized polyunsaturated compounds to form polymers integrally containing the antibody. The conjugates are prepared by covalently linking an appropriate polymerizable compound directly to an antibody or indirectly linking the antibody to the polymerizable compound via an intermediate chemical compound functioning as a spacer arm, then polymerizing the conjugate with itself, or copolymerizing the conjugate with predetermined amounts of polymerizable unsaturated compounds, and or with a polymerizable compound attached to a solid surface, to form polymers containing the antibody. These conjugates can be used for various applications, such as polymerization induced separation immunoassays. For purposes of the present invention the following terms are defined Integrally containing the antibody is covalently bonded to the polymer as it is being formed, rather than being coupled or bonded to a preformed polymer. Analyte an antigen or hapten the presence or amount of which it is desired to determine. Biological fluids blood, blood serum, blood plasma, urine, feces, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, sputum, cell and tissue derived extracts, etc. in which the analyte is suspected of being contained. Reactants naturally occurring or synthetic antigens and antibodies, which are capable of recognizing and specifically binding to each other. Antigen molecules which themselves may induce antibodies as well as small molecules which are not capable of eliciting antibody production unless they are coupled to a carrier e.g. haptens . Epitope any antigenic determinant. Monomer any polymerizable organic compound which is capable of forming end to end covalent linkages i.e. polymerizing under the appropriate conditions, and includes certain polyunsaturated oligomers. Reporter any substance which is capable of producing a detectable signal either alone or in combination with other reagents, such as, e.g., radioisotopes, fluorophores, chromophores, luminescent compounds, etc. One aspect of the present invention is directed towards an application of the technology of immunoassays, in which the binding partners of the conjugate are antigen and antibody reactants. The technology may be used 1 to measure one analyte by employing a suitable reporter reactant conjugate or analytes, 2 to measure simultaneously two or more analytes by employing the corresponding number of reporter reactant conjugates, each reporter being detectably different. The methods of this invention for the immunoassay of analytes in biological fluids utilize conjugates of reactants with monomers or signal producing compounds monomer reactant or reporter reactant conjugates . Separation of free from specifically bound reporter reactant is effected by a polymerization reaction. Detection of polymer incorporated signal can be accomplished by a variety of methods, including flow microfluorimetry and filtration. Although the following discussion pertains primarily to the immunoassay of analytes in biological fluids, it will be appreciated that there are numerous disciplines which require the assay of fluid samples for the presence or amount of organic substances. The immunoassays of the present invention can be performed in any of several configurations. These can include competitive, sandwich and noncompetitive immunoassay configurations. In every case the analyte of interest can be either an antigen or an antibody. In every case, either reactant i.e. antigen or antibody can be conjugated to either labeled substance i.e. monomer or reporter . The various possible configurations in which immunoassays can be performed are reviewed extensively in In one configuration, for example, sample suspected of containing analyte is incubated with a monomer analyte conjugate and a reporter reactant conjugate. In this case, the reactant is typically an antibody to the analyte. If the analyte is itself an antibody, the reactant can be a second antibody to the first antibody or it can be the antigen to the first antibody. Analyte present in sample and monomer analyte conjugate compete for a limited amount of reporter reactant. Polymerization induced separation of free from specifically bound reporter reactant enables the detection and measurement of analyte initially present in the sample. This configuration is referred to as competitive. In the competitive configuration, the immunoassays of this invention can be used to measure both monoepitopic compounds haptens and multiepitopic compounds. Multiepitopic is meant to include both compounds having more than one unique epitope and compounds having a single, repeated epitope. Maximum sensitivity is generally attained when the reactant is monovalent with respect to the analyte. In another configuration, the immunoassays of this invention can be performed as sandwich immunoassays. This configuration is appropriate only for multiepitopic analytes. In the forward sandwich configuration, excess monomer reactant conjugate is incubated with sample suspected of containing analyte. In this case, the reactant is typically an antibody to the analyte. If the analyte is itself an antibody, the reactant in the reporter reactant conjugate can be either a second antibody to the first antibody or an antigen to the first antibody. Incubation is carried out under conditions in which specific binding is expected to occur. Following polymerization of monomer reactant, excess reporter reactant conjugate is added to the immunoassay mixture. Typically, the reactant is an antibody which binds to a different epitope from that to which the monomer reactant conjugate binds. Again, if the analyte is itself an antibody, the reactant in the reporter reactant conjugate can be either an antibody to the first antibody or an antigen to the first antibody. After an appropriate incubation to allow specific binding to occur, the presence or amount of reporter reactant specifically bound to the polymer is determined. The polymer particles can be washed if desired to remove any free reporter reactant. In general, however, it is thought sufficient to simply dilute the reaction mixture 2 to 100 fold prior to measuring the amount of reporter associated with the polymer particle. Similarly, if desired, the polymer particles can be separated from solution and the reporter associated with them eluted prior to detection or measurement. The order of addition of reagents can also be reversed, i.e., sample suspected of containing analyte can be incubated with reporter reactant prior to addition of monomer reactant conjugate. This configuration is referred to as a reverse sandwich immunoassay. Likewise, sample, reporter reactant, and monomer reactant conjugate can be incubated simultaneously rather than sequentially, in which case the immunoassay is referred to as a simultaneous sandwich immunoassay. Of the three possible sandwich configurations, the simultaneous sandwich immunoassay is most preferred because it requires the least number of manipulations. All three configurations, however, offer significant advantages over prior art sandwich immunoassays in that incubation times are shortened and washing steps are eliminated. In another configuration, the immunoassays of this invention can be performed by incubating patient sample suspected of containing analyte with monomer reactant conjugate the reactant being an antibody to the analyte under conditions where specific binding is expected to occur. Reporter reactant can be added sequentially or simultaneously but in this case the reactant is an antibody to the monomer reactant analyte complex rather than to the analyte. Following polymerization induced separation of free from specifically bound reporter reactant, the presence or amount of reporter reactant specifically bound to the polymer particles is determined. In this configuration, the first reactant anti analyte can be conjugated to either monomer or reporter. Likewise, the second reactant anti first reactant analyte complex can be conjugated to either monomer or reporter, whichever was not conjugated to the first reactant. This configuration, which is referred to an noncompetitive, offers the advantage that both reactants can be employed in excess. Thus, the sensitivity of the immunoassay is not strictly limited by the affinity constants of the reactants This configuration is also appropriate for both monoepitopic and multiepitopic analytes. Where it is of interest to determine the presence of two or more analytes in a sample simultaneously, multiple reporter reactant conjugates can be employed in any of the above configurations, each reporter producing a detectably different signal from every other reporter. For example, the presence of two viruses in a single sample, such as lymphadenopathy associated virus LAV and hepatitis B virus, can be determined by employing antibodies to each of the viruses, one conjugated with fluorescein and the other with a phycobiliprotein. The simultaneous measurement of two or more analytes in the same sample could also be of interest in therapeutic drug monitoring, where drugs are co administered, and in the monitoring of serum proteins, such as the immunoglobulins, and hormones, for example, in thyroid function testing. The immunoassays of this invention utilize a monomer reactant conjugate. Typically, the reactant is an antibody or an antigen. Where the reactant is an antibody, either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be used. Prior to conjugation, the antibody will in general be at least partially purified by methods known in the art. Polymerizable compounds useful for forming the conjugates of the present invention include polymerizable monomers, polymerizable unsaturated compounds and oligomers. Polymerizable monomers are typically an ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated compound containing at least one functionality for coupling to the polypeptide or reactant. Functionalities on the reactant can include, for example, covalently bondable functionalities such as hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, or sulfhydryl. Olefinically unsaturated monomers can be selected from compounds having the general formula where R₁ is H or a lower alkyl radical having from one to eight carbon atoms and R₂ can be CO₂CH₂ CHOHCH₂OH CO₂ CH₂ R₃ and R₄ are most usually H, however they can be chosen to provide an unsaturated group, e.g. any allyl monomer Alternatively, R₂ and R₃ can be combined as, e.g. CO O CO Also, acetylenically unsaturated monomers having a reactable group are also useful Polymerizable polyunsaturated compounds which may be used include monomers, oligomers, and polymers containing two or more olefinic or acetylenic groups and at least one reactable site for coupling to a polypeptide, or to an intermediate chemical spacer compound. Such polymerizable poly unsaturated compounds are collectively referred to as monomers for the purposes of this disclosure, although they include certain oligomers or polymers. Oligomers or polymers of the type which may be used include Molecules with pendant and terminal unsaturation and reactable pendant groups Molecules with both pendant reactable and unsaturated groups Molecules with pendant unsaturated groups and reactable terminal groups Molecules with pendant unsaturated groups, one unsaturated terminal group and one reactable terminal group Molecules with backbone unsaturation and reactable terminal groups Molecules with backbone unsaturation and one reactable terminal group and Molecules with one unsaturated terminal group and one reactable terminal group. where O indicates a reactive polar group, and indicates unsaturation. Specific monomers which can be used include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acryloyl chloride, methacryloyl chloride, glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate, glycorol acrylate or methacrylate, allylamine, allyl chloride, hydroxylower alkyl acrylates e.g., 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA or 3 hydroxypropyl methacrylate , amino lower alkyl acrylates e.g., 2 aminoethylmethacrylate , and vinyl benzoate. Preferred monomers are those which are soluble in water or water polar organic solvent mixtures. Covalent coupling of the polymerizable compound to the reactant or its attached carbohydrate in the case of glycoprotein reactants can be carried out by any number of known chemical methods. For example, the polymerizable compound and or the reactant can be activated to produce a stable but chemically reactive intermediate which can be subsequently reacted. The reactant can also be activated by periodate oxidation of the attached carbohydrates, if the reactant is a glycoprotein. This reaction forms aldehydes which can then condensed with amino groups on the polymerizable compound, such as 2 aminoethyl methacrylate, to form a Schiff base. This Schiff base can be reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride to form a stable covalent linkage. The polymerizable compound may be in the form of an acid halide monomer and may also be directly reacted with the reactant in the presence of an acid scavenger to remove acid as it is formed during reaction. Additionally, bifunctional or hetero bifunctional reagents may be used. Such bifunctional or hetero bifunctional reagents are known. In almost all cases, the reaction conditions, i.e., time, temperature, solvent and pH, should be such as to avoid denaturation and or degradation of the reactant. A further aspect of the invention relates to chemical bonding of the monomer to a chemical intermediate compounds which functions as a spacer arm, the reactant or polypeptide also being bonded to the chemical intermediate compound. The spacer arm compound should include reactive sites, for example, covalently bondable functionalities, such as hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, or sulfhydryl groups. Examples of such compounds include ε aminocaproic acid, 1,4 diaminobutane, 1,6 diaminohexane, 1,4 butanediol, and p aminobenzoic acid. Possible advantages of the use of spacers are increased incorporation of the conjugate into the polymer and better reactivity of the reactant portion of the conjugate with its specific binding partner. Both effects are thought to be due to the enhanced accessibility of the conjugate and or the olefinic or acetylinic groups of the monomer to the bulk solution. For immunoassay purposes, generally a single species of monomer will be conjugated to a selected reactant or analyte. However, it will be appreciated that a mixture of copolymerizable monomers can be conjugated to the reactant or analyte and which are thereafter separated by polymerization. Homopolymerization of the conjugate with itself or copolymerization with nonderivatized monomers is initiated by generation of free radicals. Nonderivatized monomers which may be used include, for example, ethylenically and or acetylenically unsaturated monomers, as previously discussed, alkyl acrylates or methacrylates where the alkyl radical contains from 1 to 8 carbons, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinyl benzoate. Also, cross linking compounds may be co polymerized with the conjugate. Such cross linking compounds may include, for example N,N methylenebisacrylamide or a di , tri or tetramethacrylate or acrylate. The percentage of derivatized and nonderivatized monomer may vary from traces up to 100 , but the preferable range is between 0.001 to 100 derivatized monomer and 0 to 99.999 nonderivatized monomer. The monomer reactant conjugate, rather than being copolymerized only with nonderivatized polymerizable compounds, may also be reacted with solid surfaces where the surface has been chemically modified to render it reactable with pendant groups attached to a polymerizable compound. Such solid surfaces may be in the form of microbeads, membranes, fibers, porous solids etc. For immunoassay purposes, for example, a polymerizable compound is bonded to a solid surface. The monomer reactant is incubated with an analyte and a reporter provided for labeling the monomer reactant conjugate analyte complex. During copolymerization of the conjugate and the polymerizable compound bonded to the solid surface, the concentration of the reporter at the surface of the solid is enhanced, resulting in a more rapid and sensitive assay. The solid surface may be a polysaccharide, hydrocarbon polymer, fluorocarbon polymer, polyamide, polyurethane, polyester, vinyl polymer, cellulosic polymer or derivative of a cellulosic polymer, glass, silicone polymer. There are numerous methods by which a polymerizable compound may be attached to a solid polymeric surface. Generally a single species of reporter will be utilized in the present invention. However, it will be appreciated that a mixture of reporter reactant conjugates can be provided wherein each selected reactant species is conjugated to a distinct reporter. By utilizing an analogous mixture of monomer reactant conjugates wherein each selected monomer species has a different reactivity, a sample can be assayed for a plurality of analytes simultaneously, as is discussed more fully hereafter. Methods of coupling the reporter to the reactant or analyte are well known in the art. In general, covalent coupling is preferred, although other means of attachment are possible. The reactive sites which can be utilized for attachment are the same as those discussed above. In general, it is desirable to label the reactant with reporter as heavily as possible without loss of binding activity. Separation of the specifically bound from the free reactants is accomplished by polymerization of the conjugate. Polymerization or copolymerization with nonderivatized monomer is generally conducted at about room temperature with or without agitation. A surface active agent e.g. detergent may or may not be present. Although the reaction may be carried out in the presence of oxygen, it is generally preferred to conduct the reaction in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of a controlled amount of oxygen. The pH range may vary widely from pH 3 to pH 10, although it is preferable to select a pH where the reactant remains the most stable, which is typically between pH 6 and 8. If a surface active agent is used, suitable compounds, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium stearate, or nonionic materials, such as polyethyleneoxide or lauryl ether, may be employed. The free radicals may be generated by oxidation reduction initiation, photochemical initiation, ionizing radiation or thermal initiation. An advantage of both oxidation reduction initiation and photochemical initiation is production of free radicals at reasonable rates at relatively low temperatures, such as ambient or body temperature 22 37 C . Types of oxidation reduction initiators which may be used include 1 peroxides in combination with a reducing agent, e.g., hydrogen peroxide with ferrous ion, or benzoyl peroxide with N,N dialkylaniline or toluidine, and 2 persulfates in combination with a reducing agent, such as N,N,N ,N tetraethylmethylenediamin TEMED , sodium metabisulfite or sodium thiosulfate. Specifically, ammonium persulfate, benzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, t butyl perbenzoate, cumene hydroperoxide, or mixtures thereof with reducing agents, such as sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate, may be used. It also appears that sodium bisulfite alone may be used for polymerization. Photoinitiated polymerization may also be used by employing photoinitiators, such as azodiisobutyro nitrile, azodiisobutyroamide, benzoin methyl ether, riboflavin, thiazine dyes such as methylene blue and eosin, and transition metals such as ferric chloride or diazidotetramminecobalt III azide, in combination with ultraviolet and or visible light irradiation of the reaction system. Ionizing radiation may also be employed utilizing radiation from a radioactive source or a particle accelerator. Polymerization can be carried out in the presence of various physiological materials commonly encountered in biological fluids. Nonderivatized monomers and polymerization initiating compounds can be present in the reaction mixture throughout the immunoassay or they can be added at any appropriate time. Measurement of the amount of reporter specifically bound to the polymer can be made in any of several ways depending upon the type of signal provided by the reporter. In one embodiment the reporter is a fluorophore and fluorescence associated with polymer particles is detected or measured by flow cytometry and flow microfluorimetry. In another embodiment, fluorescence associated with polymer particles is measured after filtration of the particles. The following examples are provided by way of illustration, rather than implying any limitation of the present invention. Examples presented here utilize a representative monomer 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, HEMA , two antibodies and an antigen human IgM to be detected. The first antibody is a mouse monoclonal designated 2Hl, which reacts with the kappa light chain of human IgM and is conjugated with monomer. The second antibody is a mouse monoclonal designated 2C3, which reacts with the mu heavy chain of human IgM and does not interfere with the binding of the first antibody to human IgM. The second antibody is labeled with a fluorescent tag. Briefly stated, these examples utilize a simultaneous sandwich immunoassay configuration in which the presence of the analyte to be detected mediates the incorporation of reporter reactant fluorescein labeled 2C3 antibody into the polymer formed. The amount of reporter reactant specifically bound to the polymer, i.e. the fluorescence intensity, is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. In a typical protocol, the two reactant conjugates are incubated together with the sample suspected of containing analyte to form a ternary complex. Nonderivatized free monomer is then added, and subsequent initiation of polymerization results in copolymerization of nonderivatized monomer with monomer reactant conjugate present in the ternary complex to form a fluorescent polymer. In the absence of analyte, the reporter reactant conjugate does not form a ternary complex and the polymer particles are not substantially fluorescent. Example I demonstrates a the activation of an acrylic monomer to allow its conjugation to the first reactant, b the conjugation of the acrylic monomer to the first reactant including evidence that the conjugation was successful, c the demonstration that the monomer reactant conjugate retained the ability to bind to analyte, and d the conjugation of the second reactant with the reporter, fluorescein isothiocyanate. Example II demonstrates the polymerisation of HEMA monomer in a buffered saline solution. In order to assure noninterference in this polymerization process by compounds commonly found in or added to biological samples, this reaction was also conducted in the presence of a sample of serum and in the presence of a nonionic detergent. Example III demonstrates an analytemediated incorporation of fluorescence into the insoluble polymer particles. This was accomplished by first incubating samples of the monomer reactant conjugate and the reporter reactant conjugate either with analyte or with a control buffer solution. After subsequent polymerization the particles formed were analyzed by flow cytometry and the analyte positive sample was found to contain highly fluorescent particles, while the particles contained in the control solution exhibited only background fluorescence. Likewise the extent of this fluorescence incorporation into the particles was found to be directly related to the amount of analyte present, forming the basis for a quantative immunoassay system. Example V illustrates the synthesis of a N hydroxysuccinimide ester of the monomer vinyl benzoic acid and its conjugation to an antibody reactant. The resultant monomer antibody conjugate is employed with a fluorescein antibody conjugate the latter antibody being directed to a second noncompeting epitopic site in a sandwich immunoassay, wherein the polymer particles formed by copolymerization of the monomer antibody conjugate with free monomer are separated from the bulk solution by filtration through a 0.45 µm pore size cellulose acetate filter, washed and the signal associated therewith read from the filter using a front surfact fluorimeter. Example VI illustrates a simultaneous two color immunoassay for IgG and IgM. The same monomer antibody conjugate is employed as in Example V with two reporter reactant conjugates, one specific for IgG and conjugated to phycoerythrin and one specific for IgM and conjugated to fluorescein. Measurement of particle associated red and green fluorescence is made on a flow microfluorimeter. A mixture containing N hydroxysuccinimide NHS 4.6 g, 40 mmol and acryloyl chloride 18 mL, 220 mmol was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 3 hours in an anhydrous atmosphere and the reaction mixture, a homogeneous solution, was evaporated to a syrup. Distilled water 50 mL was added to the syrup and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 4 C. Upon addition of chloroform 50 mL , the mixture was separated into layers, and the organic layer was extracted successively with water generally 5 times with 50 mL each time until the pH of the water layer was approximately 5. The aqueous solutions so obtained were combined and extracted once with chloroform 50 mL this chloroform solution and the chloroform solution from above were combined, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated to a syrup. Crystals, obtained by storing the syrup overnight at 20 C, were triturated with diethyl ether, and harvested by filtration. Recrystallization from absolute ethanol yielded 2.0 g of the desired product. This compound was analyzed by mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, NMR, liquid chromatography, and melting point, and proved to be the N hydroxysuccinimide ester of acrylic acid Figure 1a . The N hydroxysuccinimide ester of acrylic acid NSA was reacted with mouse monoclonal antibody MAb 2Hl as follows 2.2 mg MAb in 0.29 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3, was added to 20 micrograms of NSA in a total volume of 0.5 mL. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 C for one hour with constant stirring. Of this solution, 100 microliters was then taken for an analysis by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography RP HPLC , which revealed the amount of free acrylic acid arising from nonspecific hydrolysis of NSA and remaining NSA in the reaction mix Table 1 Figure 1b . This indicated that a net of 89 nanomoles of mono mer was attached to the 14.5 nanomoles of MAb for a ratio of 6.2 monomer molecules per MAb. To remove residual NSA and its hydrolysis products and for further characterization of the derivatized antibody, 200 microliters of the reaction mixture was chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G 25 beads of dextran cross linked with epichlorohydrin from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden in the same carbonate buffer to which bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg mL, was added to prevent nonspecific adsorption of polypeptides to the Sephadex G 25. A sample of the monomer reactant conjugate was then analyzed by isoelectric focusing. In this procedure, the polypeptide subunits of the proteins were separated according to their isoelectric point, or pH at which they had no net positive or negative charge. For this purpose, the heavy and light chains of the monomer reactant conjugate were first dissociated in the presence of 3 w v sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS and 5 v v 2 mercaptoethanol and separated on the basis of molecular weight by electrophoresis in an SDS polyacrylamide slab gel. The separated heavy and light chains of the reactant were cut out from the gel and analyzed further by isoelectric focusing in a polyacrylamide slab gel according to their isoelectric point. Staining of the isoelectric focusing gel with dye Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 provided a characteristic pattern of bands for each sample. Since both the heavy and light chains of antibodies are glycoproteins which contain intrinsic variations in their sialic acid content, each heavy and light chain can be separated by a charge into a characteristic family of bands, with each band containing a polypeptide and differing amounts of sialic acid. As the reaction of the activated acrylic acid occurred primarily with amino functional groups on protein lysine residues, the addition of monomer to MAb would be expected to neutralize one positive charge on the protein subunit for each molecule of acrylic acid attached. This in turn would be expected to change the isoelectric point of the derivatized protein. The results of the isoelectric focusing analysis indicated that each heavy chain was modified by the covalent attachment of approximately three acrylic monomers Figure 2 . Analysis also indicated that the electrophoretic pattern of monomer derivatized light chain was so close to the nonderivatized polypeptide pattern that essentially minimal conjugation of monomer to light chains had occurred. On this basis, it was estimated that six moles of acrylic acid monomer was conjugated to each mole of antibody 3 per heavy chain times 2 heavy chains per antibody , which was in agreement with the analysis by RP HPLC. To show that the purified monomer reactant conjugate was still active, it was tested in an enzyme linked immmunosorbent assay ELISA , and the results indicated no loss of specific binding capacity. For this purpose, human IgG which contain the same kappa chain antigen as human IgM was absorbed to the surfaces of wells in a micro ELISA plate 96 wells . The wells were washed, residual nonspecific adsorbing sites on the plastic surface were blocked with bovine serum albumin, and then incubated with serial dilutions of the antibodies control antibody and monomer antibody conjugate . The plate was again washed, incubated with goat anti mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, o phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide. Dilute aqueous sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction, the plates were assayed on a micro ELISA reader, and the optical densities of each dilution of monomer antibody conjugate compared with that of the control antibody. On a molar basis, the monomer reactant conjugate demonstrated comparable specific binding activity to the nonconjugated antibody alone. The final step in the assembly of the components of a simultaneous sandwich immunoasssy system was the identification of a second antibody 2C3, which reacts with the mu heavy chain of human IgM that bound to a different epitope of the analyte, thus it did not block the binding of the first, monomer reactant conjugate to the analyte. The second antibody reactant was labeled with a reporter fluorescein . For this purpose, 60 micrograms 20 microliters of a 3.0 mg mL solution in DMSO of fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer II FITC was added to 1 milligram of antibody 2C3 in 0.125 mL of 0.27 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.3. The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C and chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G 25 in phosphate buffered saline to which 0.5 M NaCl and 0.1 NaN₃ had been added. This separated the fluorescein labeled antibody from any free FITC that remained in solution. The peak was collected in a volume of 0.25 ml and the fluorescein to antibody ratio, calculated from the absorbences at 280 nm and 495 nm using the equation F Ab ratio 3.1 x A495 A280 0.31 x. A495, was found to be 4.7. Using methods similar to those in Example I.C, this reporter reactant was found to be fully capable of specifically binding to analyte. Polymerization of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate in the presence of physiological compounds was carried out as follows to 2.73 mL of distilled water or phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, was added 0.06 to 0.24 mL of 25 v v 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA, Aldrich Chemical Company . Water was added to a final volume of 2.97 mL, as necessary. After bubbling prepurified nitrogen through a Pasteur pipette into the bottom of the cuvette for at least five minutes, 30 microliters of 1 M Na₂S₂O₅ was added and the precipitation of the resulting polymer was followed at 550 nm with a Beckman Model 26 spectrophotometer. Figure 3 illustrates the dependence of the rate of precipitation on the concentration of monomer. From this data, a concentration of 2 was chosen. Inclusion of fetal calf serum, up to 10 v v , or Nonidet P 40 , a nonionic detergent, available from Shell Chemical Co., at concentrations up to 1 w v , had no effect on the rate of formation of the polymer particles. Since fetal calf serum contains a variety of proteins and other physiological compounds, this indicates that most proteins and physiological compounds will not inhibit formation of the polymer particles. Since nonionic detergents are commonly used in immunoassays to solubilize biological substances, this indicates that it will be possible to utilize detergents in polymerization induced separation immunoassays without interference. This example illustrates a simultaneous two antibody sandwich immunoassay method. In this method, the reporter reactant fluorescein labeled 2C3, 5 micrograms , the analyte human IgM 4.5 micrograms and the monomer reactant acrylic acid labeled 2Hl, 5 micrograms were incubated together, which resulted in the formation of a ternary complex or sandwich containing both monomer and reporter. Copolymerization of this complex with additional nonderivatized monomer HEMA resulted in the formation of fluorescent, polymer particles sample a . For comparison, a control sample was prepared that was identical to the first except the analyte was omitted. This resulted in the formation of polymer particles that contained monomer reactant but not reporter reactant, hence the polymer particles were nonfluorescent sample b . To quantitatively compare the amounts of incorporation of fluorescence into the polymer particles from the two samples, they were subjected to quantitative flow analysis using a flow cytometer. After the polymerization had proceeded for ten minutes, the suspension of polymer particles was diluted one hundred fold and then introduced into a flow cytometer Becton Dickinson, FACS IV equipped with an Argon ion laser light source. In this procedure, the suspended particles were carried single file in a laminar stream of buffer. Interrogation of the particle stream with the laser beam generated light scatter each time a particle entered the laser pathway. The extent of the light scatter was a reflection of particle size and shape. The measurement of light scatter is used to electronically trigger a simultaneous measure of fluorescence emitted from the particle. In this way, fluorescence specifically associated with polymer particles can be selectively measured. The results are graphically presented in Figure 4, which compares the fluorescence intensity of copolymer particles from a sample a dotted line with the fluorescence intensity of copolymer particles from a control sample b solid line , from which the analyte was omitted. The fluorescence intensity of the copolymer particles formed in the presence of analyte complete system was shifted over 73 channels relative to the control see arrows in Figure 4 . The fluroescence intensity scale x axis is logarithmic, and a shift of 73 channels corresponded to an 20 fold increase in fluorescence intensity. This increase in fluorescence intensity proved to be a linear function of the amount of analyte present in the sample. Figure 5 is a plot of fluorescence intensity, on a linear scale, against the amount of analyte present in the sample, using 1 microgram of each reactant conjugate and otherwise the same conditions as used in Figure 3. In order to provide a means of identifying and monitoring the presence of polypeptides in polymers, the monomer antibody conjugate MAb M was covalently tagged with a fluorescent compound. For this purpose, 88 micrograms 8.8 microliters of 10 mg mL in DMSO of fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer II FITC was added to 3.6 mg MAb M in 1.2 mL of 0.29M carbonate buffer, pH 9.3. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 37 C and chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G 25 in phosphate buffered saline to which bovine serum albumin 0.01 mg mL had been added to prevent nonspecific adsorption to the column. This separated the fluorescein tagged MAb M from any free fluorescein isothiocyanate that remained in solution. The fluorescein tagged MAb M conjugates were then copolymerized with additional HEMA to form insoluble polymer particles. Two methods were used to demonstrate the incorporation of fluorescein tagged MAb M into the The same experiment was examined by quantitative flow analysis with a fluorescence activated cell sorter. After the polymerization had proceeded for ten minutes, the suspension of polymer particles was diluted one hundred fold and then introduced into a flow cytometer Becton Dickinson, FACS IV equipped with an Argon ion laser light source. In this procedure, the suspended particles were carried single file in a laminar stream of buffer. Interrogation of the particle stream with the laser beam generated light scatter each time a particle entered the laser pathway. The extent of the light scatter was a reflection of particle size and shape. Further, measurement of light scatter can also be used to electronically trigger a simultaneous measure of fluorescence emitted from the particle which was responsible for the light scatter signal. In this way, fluorescence specifically associated with polymer particles can be selectively measured. The results can be summarized by reference to Fig. 6 as follows To 1 g 6.74 mmoles of VBA in 40 ml of tetrahydrofuran THF were added 0.775 g of NHS and 1.39 g of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide . The resultant mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was filtered and a small amount of p methoxyphenol was added to the filtrate. The filtrate was then evaporated to dryness, yielding pale yellow crystals which were subsequently triturated with diethyl ether. The resultant solid was recrystallized once from methanol. Analysis by NMR, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy confirmed the identity of the compound as N succinimidyloxy 4 vinyl benzoate NSB . A murine monoclonal antibody designated 2Hl, which is reactive with kappa light chains of human immunoglobulin, was conjugated to NSB to yield a monomer antibody conjugate. Briefly, to 7 mg of purified 2Hl IgC in 1.23 mL of 0.29 M carbonate buffer pH 9.3 was added 113 micrograms of NSB in 11.3 microliters of THF. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 37 C and then chromatographed on a Sephadex G 25 column PD 10 disposable column from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, N.J. which had been equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline PBS, pH 7.4 . Fractions were collected and their absorbance at 280 nm determined. The peak fractions were pooled, divided into 100 microliter aliquots, and stored frozen at 20 C until needed. A murine monoclonal antibody, designated 3F6, which is reactive with gamma heavy chains of human immunoglobulin, was conjugated to FITC to yield a reporter antibody conjugate. Briefly, 60 micrograms 20 microliters of a 3.0 mg mL solution in DMSO of FITC isomer II was added to 1 mg of purified 3F6 IgG in 0.125 mL of 0.29 M carbonate buffer pH 9.3 . The mixture was incubated for one half hour at 37 C and then chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G 25 equilibrated in PBS 0.5M NaCl 0.1 w v NaN₃. Fractions were collected and the fluorescein to antibody protein F P ratio of the peak fractions determined using the following equation The F P ratio was found to be approximately 5. An immunoassay for human IgG was performed using NSB conjugated antibody 2Hl Ab The assay was performed as follows Ab Table I compares the relative fluorescence intensity obtained for various concentrations of antigen using the two methods of measurement. NSB conjugated 2Hl Ab The murine monoclonal antibody, designated 3F6, which is reactive with gamma heavy chains of human immunoglobulin, was conjugated to R phycoerythrin PE to yield a reporter antibody conjugate. R phycoerythrin was purified from the red alga The introduction of thiol groups into 3F6 was accomplished as follows To 2.5 mg of purified 3F6 IgG in 0.5 mL of PBS was added 5 microliters of a 60 mg mL solution of S acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride in DMF. The mixture was incubated at room temperature with continuous stirring for one half hour, after which 0.5 mL of 1 M hy droxylamine, pH7.0 and 0.05 mL of 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 M EDTA were added. Incubation was continued for ten minutes at room temperature, after which the reaction mixture was chromatographed on a Sephadex G 25 column 1.0 x 45 cm equilibrated in 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.005 M EDTA. Fractions were collected and their absorbance at 280 nm determined. The peak fractions were pooled and the number of thiol groups per mole of IgG determined according to the method of Grassetti, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. Reactive maleimide groups were introduced into PE as follows To 1.0 mg of PE in 1.0 mL of PBS was added 25 microliters of a 0.9 mg mL solution of SMCC in DMF. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for one half hour, after which it was chromatographed on a Sephadex G 25 column 1.0 x 45 cm equilibrated in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Fractions were collected and their absorbence at 280 nm monitored. The peak fractions were pooled and the molar ratio of SMCC to PE determined accordingly to the method of Ishikawa, J., Immunoassay The resultant PE derivative was coupled to thiolated 3F6 as follows To 1 mg of PE derivative in 2 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was added 1.5 mg of thiolated 3F6 in 1 mL of 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.005 M EDTA. After mixing, 0.3 mL of 10X PBS was added and the resultant mixture was incubated at room temperature for two hours. After incubation, 50 microliters of 0.1 M N ethylmaleimide in DMF was added. Incubation was continued for 10 minutes, after which the reaction mixture was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S 300 column 1.5 x 120 cm equilibrated in PBS containing 0.1 w v aside. Two PE containing peaks were obtained, the higher molecular weight peak corresponding to 3F6 conjugated PE and the lower molecular weight peak, to unconjugated PE. The fractions corresponding to the high molecular weight peak were pooled and found to have a molar ratio of 3F6 to PE of 1.5. This conjugate is referred to as Ab A polymerization induced separation immunoassay for the simultaneous two color measurement of human IgG and IgM was conducted as follows Ab Simultaneous two color measurement of IgG and IgM was carried out in a series of samples with presentation of the data as number of particles vertical axis versus log green fluorescence versus log red fluorescence on a 64 x 64 dot grid with each 4.5 dots representing an approximate doubling of fluorescence. A first fluorescence profile of copolymer particles was formed in the presence of 0 micrograms mL IgM and 1 microgram mL IgG and fluoresced, with no green fluorescence above background. A second fluorescence profile of copolymer particles formed in the presence of 1 micrograms mL IgM and 0 micrograms mL IgG particles fluoresced green. A fluorescence profile obtained by mixing the copolymer particles formed in the first profile with those formed in the second profile resulted in two distinct peaks, a green peak which contains the IgM bearing particles and a red peak which contains the IgG bearing particles. Fluorescence profiles of copolymer particles formed in the presence of a constant amount of IgG 1 micrograms mL and varying amounts of IgM 0 micrograms mL final concentration, 0.125 micrograms mL, 0.500 micrograms mL, and 1.0 micrograms mL, respectively . The copolymer particles formed emitted both green and red fluorescence and, when graphed, form a single peak which moves out along both axes in proportion to the amount of each antigen present in the sample.
