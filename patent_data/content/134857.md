# Method for the fabrication of special steels in metallurgical vessels.

## Abstract
The device consists of a retractible tuyere which can be used with different types of steel melting furnaces, or any other metallurgical vessel. Said tuyere is introduced in the liquid steel bath to make the controlled refining of the same by means of gaseous oxygen injection with any other inert gas, generally argon. The retractible tuyere consists of two concentric pipes. Through the annular gap between the pipes a cooling gas or liquid fluid is injected, which is generally a hydrocarbon. Through the center pipe a refining gas mixture is injected. The system also consists of a cooled tuyere holding box and a fluid control and injection system. The tuyere is generally introduced through an opening made in the side wall of the furnace, in a way that the tip of the same is located below the liquid steel level. Due to the retractible characteris tic of the tuyere, the same is introduced in the bath only during the time required by the process.
