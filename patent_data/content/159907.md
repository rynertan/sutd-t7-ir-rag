# TESTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An in circuit testing apparatus manufacturing defects analyser for the determination of manufacturing defects in an electrical circuit board such as short circuits, tracking faults, mininserted omitted and out of tolerance com ponents, etc., and not for effecting full functional testing of the circuit board, comprises an array of bidirectionally cur rent conducting analog switching networks each of which defines a test point for connection to a node of a circuit board and connectable, under software control of the res pective switching network, either to a stimulus source or to a reference e.g. ground potential and simultaneously also to an input of a measurement facility. A resistor, capacitor, inductor or other circuit component can be connected bet ween the test points defined by two of the switching net works and can thus be subjected to an appropriate stimulus and its response measured and analysed for determining the viability of the respective component. A modified form of the apparatus enables the gain of discrete transistors also to be monitored. A desk top form of the apparatus has a recess in its main housing for receiving an interchange able board probing module which is customised to a par ticular board to be tested and has a customised probe array coupled to one part of a universal interface connector, the other part of the universal interface connector being provided in the recess in the main housing such that the two parts come together when the module is inserted into the housing recess.
