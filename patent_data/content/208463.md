# Planarization of metal films for multilevel interconnects.

## Abstract
In the fabrication of multilevel integrated circuits, each metal layer 54, 64 is planarized by heating to momentarily melt the layer. The layer is melted by sweeping laser pulses of suitable width, typically about 1 microsecond duration, over the layer in small increments. The planarization of each metal layer eliminates irregular and discontinuous conditions be tween successive layers. The planarization method is part icularly applicable to circuits having ground or power planes 64 and allows for multilevel interconnects. Dielectric layers 50, 60 can also be planarized to produce a fully planar multi level interconnect structure. The method is useful for the fab rication of VLSI circuits, particularly for wafer scale integra tion.
