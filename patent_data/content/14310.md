# Substrate bias generator.

## Abstract
A substrate bias generator comprises a capacitor 222 including an electrically insulating film 270 sandwiched between two electrodes 226,272 one of which is disposed on one main face of a P semiconductor substrate 210 through another electrically insulating film 224 , and first, second and third N semiconductor regions 214 218 disposed in spaced relationship on the same main face. The first and second regions 214, 216 form a grounded source and a drain of a MOSFET 228 connected to both its gate and one of the electrodes 272 of the capacitor 222 . The second and third regions 216, 218 form a source and a drain of another MOSFET 234 connected to both its gate and the other main face of the substrate 210 . A signal is applied to the other electrode of the capacitor 222 .
