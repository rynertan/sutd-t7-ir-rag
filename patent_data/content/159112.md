## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF DIAMINOPYRIDINES The present invention relates to a new and particularly efficient process for preparing a diaminopyridine of the formulaEMI1.1 or a salt thereof, wherein R1is hydrogen or Cl C4 alkyl and one of X and Z is CH and the other is N, comprising treating a nitrohydrazinopyridine of the formulaEMI1.2 or a salt thereof, wherein R2 is hydrogen, phenyl,EMI1.3 EMI2.1 and R3 is Cl C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy or phenyl, with the proviso that both Z groups and Rl groups are the same, in a suitable solvent with an activated nickel catalyst in the presence of hydrogen gas. The present process has been found useful in producing large quantities of either a 2,3 or 3,4diaminopyridine derivative. The process produces the desired product in very high yields and provides the product consistently in high purity, so that the compound may be used in the preparation of biologically active compounds without additional expensive purification steps. In the above formula, C1 C4 alkyl represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having from one to four carbon atoms. Typical C1 C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec. butyl, and t butyl. The term C1 C4 alkoxy represents a straight or branched alkoxy chain having from one to four carbon atoms. Typical C1 C4 alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, sec. butoxy and the like. While the entire scope of process variables taught herein are believed operable, the present process does have preferred aspects. Preferably, both R1 and R2 are hydrogen and Z is CH. Other preferred process conditions will be noted hereinafter. The process of the present invention is typically conducted as follows. The nitrohydrazinopyridine, or a salt thereof, is dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example any one of the several non reactive monohydric alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and the like ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran and saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, the xylenes and the like. Of these, ethanol is preferred. The concentration of the starting pyridine in the solvent is not critical, but it is preferred to use enough solvent to keep the starting material in solution. A slight excess of solvent is preferably used. Large volumes of solvent are not necessary nor desirable in this process. Typical salts comprehended herein include acid addition salts, such as hydrobromide and especially hydrochloride salts. An activated nickel catalyst is also employed in the process of the present invention. Raney Nickel is an example of an activated nickel catalyst. This material is widely available commercially or can be prepared by fusing 50 parts nickel with 50 parts aluminum, pulverizing the alloy thus formed, and dissolving out most of the aluminum with sodium hydroxide. RaneyNickel contains hydrogen which dissipates upon storage thereby inactivating the catalyst. Therefore the use of fresh catalyst in the present reaction is preferred, that is, catalyst that is not older than approximately six months. The catalyst is preferably stored under alcohol although other solvents also work. The acti vated nickel catalyst is typically present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of from about onetenth part to about 100 parts by weight of starting material to one part of catalyst by weight.It should be noted that greater or lesser quantities of catalyst may be employed if desired depending on the specified conditions. The process of the present invention is conducted in the presence of hydrogen generally at a pressure in the range of from about standard pressure to approximately 100 pounds per square inch. The reaction is substantially complete after about 1 to 24 hours when conducted at a temperature in the range of about 150C to about 100 C, more preferably from about 200C to about 5O0C. Once the process of the present invention is complete, the product may be isolated according to standard procedures. Typically the reaction mixture is filtered through infusorial earth to remove the activated nickel catalyst. The filtrate is then normally concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the appropriate diaminopyridine derivative, or a salt thereof as defined above. The product thus isolated may then be further purified if desired by employing any one of several coaon techniques such as crystallization from common solvents or column chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina. The diaminopyridine compounds prepared by the process of the present invention are useful as intermediates for the preparation of a variety of compounds, for example pharmaceuticals useful for the treatment of a variety of human disorders. See, e.g. U.S. PatentNos. 3,985,891 and 4,327,100 use of 2,3 diaminopyridine in the preparation of imidazo 4,5 b pyridine inotropic agents and European Patent Application 72,926 use of 3,4 diaminopyridine in the preparation of imidazo 14,5 c pyridine inotropic agents . The reader is also referred to U.S. Patent No. 4,386,095 which teaches the use of diaminopyridines to ameliorate decreased cognition occurring with ageing in mammals. The nitrohydrazinopyridine starting materials are easily prepared by a variety of known reactions from assorted readily available starting materials.Certain of these reactions are defined by the scheme that follows EMI6.1 wherein RÚ and R2 are as defined above and R4 is C1 C4 alkyl. The hydroxypyridine and chloropyridine starting materials are generally commercially available or readily prepared by well known procedures. The processes for converting those compounds to the corresponding nitropyridine derivatives with nitric acid and sulfuric acids are reported in the literature as well.See, e.g. Koenigs and Freter, Ber. 57, 1187 1924 .Converting the hydroxynitropyridine to the chloronitropyridine is also readily accomplished by reacting the compound with either phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus oxychloride. See Koenings et al., supra. The nitrohydrazinopyridine may be prepared from the corresponding nitrochloro or nitroalkoxypyridine with a hydrazine or hydrazide derivative according to well known procedures. These processes comprise reacting one mole equivalent of the pyridine starting material with at least one mole equivalent of an appropriate hydrazine or hydrazide derivative in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include the polar, aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide and especially acetonitrile or methylene chloride. The reaction is substantially complete after about 1 to 24 hours when conducted at a temperature in the range of from about 250C to about 2000C, more preferably at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The product is then typically isolated by either collecting the precipitated solid by filtration or concentrating the reaction mixture under vacuum. The product thus isolated may be further purified if desired by standard techniques. Koenigs et al., supra.generally describe the preparation of certain of the nitrohydrazinopyridine compounds employed herein, or preparations analogous thereto.
