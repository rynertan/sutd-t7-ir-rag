# Method of applying a resist.

## Abstract
In a photoresist process which comprises a process for spin coating a substrate 7 with a resist 10 , a process for transferring a mask pattern 4, 5 onto the coated resist film followed by exposure 8 , and a developing process for form ing a pattern on the substrate after the pattern 4, 5 has been exposed. When the developed pattern of the resist pulsates with the increase or decrease of parameters in the process of applying resist 10 , the value of the parameter is set to a value that corresponds to an extreme value of the pulsation.
