## Description
ANAEROBICALLY CURING COMPOSITIONS Technical Field This invention relates to anaerobically curing compositions. Background Art Anaerobically curing compositions generally comprise polymerizable acrylate monomers and free radical initiators. When maintained in an oxygen containing environment, such compositions remain uncured i.e., unpolymerized . However, in the absence of oxygen, such as when an anaerobically curing composition is placed between surfaces which are in close engagement with one another e.g. a nut and bolt , cure will ensue. Anaerobically curing compositions containing peroxide or hydroperoxide initiators are well known in the art, having been described in U.S. Patent No. 2,895,950 Krieble . Commonly such compositions contain quinonetype compounds which act as polymerization inhibitors, thereby maintaining the compositions in an uncured state when stored in the presence of oxygen. Unfortunately, anaerobically curing compositions which contain peroxide or hydroperoxide initiators may possess certain disadvantages. For example, there is often the possibility of explosion whenever large amounts of peroxy compounds are handled such as during manufacture of these compositions. Furthermore, unfortunately peroxy compounds typically decompose with time, thus resulting in a steadily decreasing ability of such compounds to initiate the polymerization of compositions containing them. While one part, anaerobically curing compositions containing polymerization initiators other than peroxy compounds are known in the art, such compositions often fail to exhibit a suitable balance of shelf life stability versus cure rate. In particular, while such compositions may exhibit suitable shelf life stability in the presence of oxygen, they may cure at unsatisfactory rates when oxygen is excluded. Alternatively, such compositions may often cure rapidly in the absence of oxygen, but may exhibit unsatisfactory shelf lives. Disclosure of Invention The present invention provides novel anaerobically curing compositions comprising A a polymerizable monomer having at least one a, Sunsaturated carboxyl functionality per molecule of monomer B a halogen containing compound as a first initiator component C an organic thiol as a second initiator component and D an inhibitor of free radical polymerization. The compositions of the present invention exhibit suitable shelf life e.g., at least about 4 weeks at 1200F. when stored in the presence of oxygen and cure rapidly to form strong bonds in the absence of oxygen.Furthermore, the compositions of the present invention, since they do not contain peroxides or hydroperoxides, may be stored for extended periods of time without fear of initiator decomposition. Also, since the compositions of the present invention do not contain peroxides or hydroperoxides, there is no possibility of explosion during manufacture of these compositions. The compositions of the present invention are particularly suitable for bonding operations involving at least one active metal e.g., copper and cold rolled steel and are further suitable for bonding relatively inactive metals e.g., zinc and cadmium . The compositions are also suitable for bonding nonmetallic substrates e.g., plastic, glass and wood provided that appropriate primers are used to accelerate the cure to a useful rate. The compositions of the present invention may be formulated as non viscous, flowable liquids which are particularly useful in bonding operations involving well mated surfaces e.g., a nut and bolt . The compositions may also comprise various types of modifying polymers it rider to obtain desired properties. For example, thermoplastic polymers or pressure sensitive polymers may be added to the compositions of the present invention to obtain compositions which are useful in a variety of other bonding operations. Detailed Description The anaerobic compositions of the present invention comprise 100 parts by weight of a polymerizable monomer A having at least one a,ss unsaturated carboxyl functionality i.e.,EMI3.1 tb SEP 0 tb N tb SEP C C C SEP SEP per tb SEP 0 molecule of monomer.Suitable monomers for employment in the compositions of the present invention include the diacrylates and dimethacrylates described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,043,820 Krieble , 3,457,212 Fukuoka et al. , 3,923,737 George et al. , and 3,944,521 Bradley et al. . Other suitable polymerizable monomers include acrylate terminated monomers such as the monomeric polyacrylate esters formed from organic polyisocyanates, such monomers being described, for example, in U.S.. Patent No. 3,425,988 Gorman et al. .Particularly suitable polyfunctional acrylates or methacrylates include triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, polyethyleneglycol diacrylate, polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 1,3 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, neopentylglycol dimethacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate, propoxylated bisphenol C dimethacrylate and bisphenol A bis 2 hydroxypropyl dimethacrylate. Monoacrylates and monomethacrylates are also suitable for employment in the compositions of the present invention as the polymerizable monomer. Suitable monoacrylates and monomethacrylates include cyclohexyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isooctyl acrylate and n butyl acrylate. Methacrylic acid and similar ar unsaturated carboxylic acids are also suitable for employment as polymerizable monomers in the compositions of the present invention as are half esters such as the 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate half ester of maleic acid. Other suitable half esters include those described in U.S. Patent Nos.3,428,614 Brownstein and 4,080,238 Wolinski et al. . In order to enhance the shelf life of the compositions of the present invention it may be desirable to remove metal ions, if such are present, from the polymerizable monomer. This may be particularly desirable in the event that commercially obtained monomers, which often contain significant amounts of metal ions, are employed in these compositions. Removal of metal ions may be effected by means known to those skilled in the art. The compositions of the present invention may comprise a single type of polymerizable monomer or may comprise a blend of two or more different polymerizable monomers. Compositions of the present invention further comprise about 0.5 to 20 parts by weight and preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of a halogen containing compound B as a first initiator component per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer A .

The compositions of the present invention may comprise a single type of halogen containing compound or may comprise two or more different types of halogencontaining compounds. Compositions of the present invention also comprise an organic thiol as a second initiator component C . The organic thiol is present in the compositions of the present invention in amounts of about 0.05 to 0.5 parts by weight and preferably 0.1 to 0.3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer. One class of thiols which are suitable for use as the second initiator component are of the following general formula IV R4 SH IV wherein R4 is an organic radical comprising 1 to about 20 carbon atoms and preferably 6 to 18 carbon atoms.While it is preferred that R4 of formula IV be an unsubstituted hydrocarbon group of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, R4 may contain any substituent which does not adversely affect the compound for its intended use as an initiator component. R4 may be either an aliphatic or aromatic group. Examples of suitable thiols of formula IV are tert hexadecyl mercaptan, benzyl mercaptan, 2,3 dimercapto succinic acid, thiomalic acid, oxydibenzyl mercaptan, and pentachlorothiolphenol. Preferred thiols of formula IV are dodecylmercaptan and octylmercaptan. A second class of thiols which are suitable for use as the second initiator component are mercapto esters. Examples of suitable mercapto esters are glycol dimercaptoacetate, methyl mercaptopropionate, glycol dimercaptopropionate, pentaerythritol tetra 3 mercaptopropionate , pentaerythritol tetrathioglycolate, trimethylolethane tri 3 mercaptopropionate , trimethylolethane trithioglycolate, trimethylolpropane tri 3 mercaptopropionate and trimethylolpropane trithioglycolate. It has also been found in the present invention that inclusion of certain amines in combination with the halogen containing compound B and the organic thiol C in the compositions of the present invention results in compositions exhibiting particularly suitable cures. These compositions may comprise up to about 20 parts by weight and preferably about 1 to 10 parts by weight of an amine per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer A . Suitable amines for employment in these compositions are secondary amines and tertiary amines. More particularly, suitable secondary amines are of the following formula V EMI9.1 wherein R5 and R6 are each organic radicals, preferably hydrocarbon groups, comprising 1 to about 12 carbons.It is to be understood that R5 and R6 of formula V can be united to form a heterocyclic secondary amine. Examples of suitable secondary amines of formula VI are N,N diethylamine, N,N diphenylamine and homopiperidene. Suitable tertiary amines are of the following formula VI EMI9.2 wherein R7, R8 and R9 are each organic radicals, preferably hydrocarbon groups, comprising 1 to about 12 carbons.It is to be understood that any two of R7, R8 and R9 of formula VI may be combined to form a heterocyclic tertiary amine.

The preferred tertiary aromatic amine is N,N dimethyl p toluidine. A preferred amine for employment in the preferred dodecyl mercaptan containing compositions of the present invention is above mentionedN,N dimethyl p toluidine. In order to obtain compositions exhibiting suitable shelf life, the compositions of the present invention also comprise a sufficient amount of an inhibitor of free radical polymerization to retard polymerization of the compositions while in the presence of air. Preferred compositions of the present invention comprise about 0.0005 to 0.10 parts by weight and most preferably about 0.001 to 0.03 parts by weight of a conventional quinonetype inhibitor i.e., quinone and its derivatives per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer A .Preferred quinone type inhibitors for employment in the compositions of the present invention are hydroquinone, methylhydroquinone and benzoquinone. Other suitable quinone type inhibitors are described in U.S. Patent No.4,166,169 Patel et al. . Other inhibitors of free radical polymerization which are well known in the art may also be used in the compositions of the present invention. Employment of a commercially obtained polymerizable monomer, which generally will already contain a conventional inhibitor e.g., hydroquinone or methylhydroquinone , may introduce a sufficient amount of the inhibitor into the compositions of the present invention such that it may be unnecessary to separately add additional inhibitor. Compositions comprising the aforementioned components A , B and C generally exhibit low viscosity and are particularly useful for bonding well mated surfaces such as the threads of a nut and bolt. Fixturing of the surfaces involved in the bonding operation may be necessary when employing compositions comprising only components A , B , and C until sufficient bond strength has developed. Fixture time i.e., the time required to develop a bond between surfaces which will withstand forces exerted with hand strength will typically be within less than about 1 hour at room temperature. In many bonding applications, it may be desirable to achieve bonding characteristics not obtainable with compositions comprising only components A , B , and C . Thus, the compositions of the present invention may further comprise up to about 950 parts by weight of various modifying polymers per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer A . Modifying polymers which may be present in these compositions include polymers added to obtain desired viscosities. Other modifying polymers which may be present in these compositions include thermoplastic polymers and pressure sensitive polymers, the latter also generally being thermoplastic in nature.Preferred modifying polymers are substantially nonreactive i.e., will not generally be subject to free radicalinitiated polymerization under the anaerobic conditions typically used to cure the compositions of the present invention . Polymers useful as modifying polymers for providing compositions exhibiting increased viscosity are well known in the art and include cellulose acetate butyrates, polymethacrylates, phenoxy resins, polyesters and polyurethanes. A preferred modifying polymer for increasing viscosities of these compositions is PKHAResin a phenoxy resin commercially available from UnionCarbide . A particularly suitable amount of the modifying polymers for providing compositions exhibiting increased viscosities is up to about 25 parts by weight per 100 parts weight of the polymerizable monomer A . Thermoplastic polymers useful as modifying polymers in these compositions are well known in the art and include those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,996,308 Douek et al. . Examples of particularly suitable thermoplastic polymers include polyvinyl acetates e.g.that available under the trade designation AYAT Resin from Union Carbide , phenoxy resins e.g., that available under the trade designation PKHJ Resin from UnionCarbide , polyesters e.g. that available under the trade designation Vitel 207 from B.F. Goodrich , polyurethanes e.g. that available under the trade designation Estane 5712 from B.F. Goodrich , and nitrile rubbers e.g., that available under the trade designation Hycar 1072 fromB. F. Goodrich . Pressure sensitive polymers useful as modifying polymers in these compositions include those described inU.S. Patent No. Re. 24,906 Ulrich and U.S. Patent No.4,113,792 Pastor et al. . Examples of particularly suitable pressure sensitive polymers include copolymers of isooctyl acrylate and acrylic acid, copolymers of isobutyl acrylate and acrylic acid and copolymers of n butyl acrylate and acrylic acid, these copolymers preferably containing about 90 by weight of the respective alkyl acrylate and about 10 by weight of acrylic acid. Another suitable polymer is the terpolymer containing isobutyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate and acrylic acid residues. A particularly suitable amount of thermoplastic or pressure sensitive modifying polymers for employment in the compositions of the present invention is from about 25 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer A . Compositions of the present invention which comprise the various modifying polymers discussed above may further comprise the various tackifiers, plasticizers and the like which are well known in the art in order to obtain desired properties. Compositions comprising modifying polymers may be conveniently applied to surfaces as viscous neat liquids, sheets, films, tapes and the like, or as solutions in suitable organic solvents. Depending on the type of modifying polymer employed in the composition, fixturing of the surfaces involved in the bonding operation may or may not be necessary. It is understood that the compositions of the present invention may also comprise various other ingredients such as fillers, thickening agents, and the like which are well known in the art. It is also understood that the compositions of the present invention may be formulated as two part compositions with at least one part comprising as a major constituent a polymerizable monomer and with one part comprising the first initiator component i.e., a halogencontaining compound and the other part comprising the second initiator component i.e., an organic thiol . If only one part comprises a polymerizable monomer, the monomer less part may comprise the respective initiator component combined with a suitable vehicle such as a volatile organic solvent. Alternatively, if that initiator component is a neat liquid, it can be employed simply as such. When the compositions of the present invention are employed in bonding operations involving at least one active metal surface e.g., copper and cold rolled steel , cure will rapidly ensue at room temperature in the absence of oxygen. However, it is known that anaerobically curing compositions, including those of the present invention, may cure only very slowly, if at all, when no active metal surfaces are involved in the bonding operation. Thus when the compositions of the present invention are to be employed in bonding operations involving relatively inactive metals e.g., cadmium and zinc or nonmetal substrates e.g., plastic, glass and wood or combinations thereof, it is often desirable or perhaps even necessary to employ an appropriate activator which is preapplied to at least one of the surfaces to be bonded.Such an activator can, of course, be employed to further accelerate cure when active metal surfaces are involved in the bonding operation. Particularly suitable activators include compounds containing transition metal ions, examples of such activators including iron acetylacetonate, vanadium acetylacetonate, and copper octoate. A preferred activator of this type is copper acetylacetonate. It may be desirable to employ an activator having the metal ion in a higher versus lower oxidation state. The activator may be applied to a substrate by means of a suitable vehicle. For example, the activator may be 2Drlied as a solution in a volatile organic solvent. A volatile organic solvent is desirable as a vehicle for the activator in order to insure rapid evaporation of the solvent and to thus reduce the possibility of entrapment of solvent between the surfaces being bonded as the bonding operation proceeds. A preferred solvent for use in the present invention is methylene chloride.Activators which are liquids or solids at the temperature at which the bonding operation is conducted may also be applied directly to a substrate without dissolution in a vehicle. In the following examples which will serve to illustrate the present invention all parts are parts by weight and all percentages are percentages by weight, unless otherwise indicated. TEST METHODSAccelerated Shelf life Stability Test Method A In testing the accelerated stability of a composition, a 500 cc polyethylene bottle is filled with approximately 250cc of the composition and the bottle is then sealed with a screw cap. The bottle and contents are stored at 1200F. 490C. for 28 days, after which time the contents are examined for polymerization and for curability.Overlap Shear Test Method B In testing the performance of a composition, 3 to 4 drops about 0.15 to 0.20 cc of the composition is applied to an etched aluminum strip which in turn is brought into contact with a second etched aluminum strip such that the area of adhesive bonding between the two strips measures l inch2 6.45 cm2 . The etched aluminum strips have previously been primed with a 1 solution w w of copper II acetylacetonate in methylene chloride. The handling time i.e., the time at which the two strips could no longer be pulled apart with gentle hand pressure is measured in hours. The bond is then allowed to condition for 3 days at room temperature, at which time overlap shear value given in pounds per square inch, hereinafter psi is determined using an InstronDynamic tester with a jaw separation rate of 0.2 inch 0.51 cm per minute.Thread Locking Test Method C In testing the performance of a composition, one drop about 0.05 cc of the composition is applied to the threads of a cleaned 3 8 inch 0.95 cm No. 16, grade 5, plain finished steel bolt to which a mating nut is subsequently applied. The fixture time i.e., the time at which the nut could no longer be unscrewed from the bolt using hand strength only is determined at room tempera ture. The nut and bolt assembly is then allowed to condition for 24 hours at room temperature and break away torque and prevailing off torque values are subsequently measured both given in inch pounds .
