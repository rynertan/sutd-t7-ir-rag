# A monopolar or bipolar electrochemical terminal unit having an electric current transmission element.

## Abstract
The invention is an electrochemical terminal unit suit able for use in monopolar or bipolar electrochemical cells comprising an electric current current transmission element ECTE in the form of a substantially planar, electrically conductive support portion 17 having a plurality of bosses 18 on at least one face of the support portion, and a frame like flange portion 16 extending around a peripheral edge of the support portion, a liner having a profile matching the face of the ECTE and made from a corrosion resistant metal, wherein said liner is disposed against at least one of the opposite surfaces of said ECTE foraminous electrode components 36 are disposed against said liner, said electrode components and said liner being connected together to at least a portion of said bosses and an electrical connection means 21 for connecting a pole of an electric current power supply to said ECTE.
