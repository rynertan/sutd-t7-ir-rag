## Description
This invention relates to a method of diagnosing an automatic programming system for creating NC data. Automatic programming systems have come into practical use and are utilized to create NC tapes from a design drawing through a simple operation by entering data in a conversational mode using a graphic display screen. With such an automatic programming system, a machining profile can be entered merely by pressing profile symbol keys, which are located on an operator s panel, corresponding to a workpiece profile written on a design drawing. Further, according to the automatic programming system, reference information is graphically displayed on the screen from time to time and prompts are made in ordinary language, so that dimensions and various data can be entered in response to the prompts. When all data necessary for creation of an NC tape have been entered, the system immediately displays graphically the blank profile and the machined profile finished profile , begins automatic calculation of NC command data and graphically displays a tool path to create an NC tape. As shown in Fig. 1, a previously proposed programming method performed by such an automatic programming system comprises the following steps Fig. 2 A shows an initially displayed frame, B a job step selection frame, C a material selection frame, D a drawing format selection frame, E a blank profile selection frame, F a part profile and dimensions input frame a frame in which shape element symbols SB and a part profile PF are displayed based on entered profile and dimension data , G a machine reference point and data input frame a frame in which the part profile PF entered at the previous step is displayed , H a machining process selection frame, I a tool selection and tool data input frame, J a cutting condition confirmation frame, and K a cutting direction selection frame. An automatic programming system must be diagnosed to determine whether it is operating normally before being shipped or prior to starting an automatic programming operation. In an automatic programming system, a previously proposed method of performing diagnosis involves storing a data file referred to as a family program in a non volatile memory such as a CMOS in advance, the data file being a collection of data entered at each step of automatic programming, performing automatic programming processing by using the data of each step contained in the family program without entering the data from the keyboard one item at a time when diagnosis is made, and performing a parity check in concurrence with the automatic programming processing. More specifically, when performing diagnosis, the family program is called from the non volatile memory to a RAM, the data corresponding to each step are subsequently extracted from the family program data, these data are used to form and display a picture corresponding to each step, and a soft key or the R0 key provided on the keyboard is then pressed to advance to the next step. Thereafter, the same processing is performed to advance the steps of the automatic programming operation. In concurrence with this processing, the data fetched from the RAM and a ROM are subjected to a parity check and, if a parity error occurs, an alarm is issued to indicate that a malfunction has developed in the system. With this previously proposed method, however, the operator must press the soft key or the R0 key to advance to each subsequent step. This is inconvenient because the diagnostic processing cannot be executed automatically. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of automatically advancing a displayed picture whereby each subsequent step can be shifted to automatically without pressing any soft key or R0 key, thus enabling the system to be diagnosed automatically. According to the present invention there is provided a method of diagnosing an automatic programming system which includes ROM and RAM as program memory and data memory and is operable to display on a display unit a predetermined sequence of pictures conforming to respective steps of a plurality of data input steps performed by an operator in response to the pictures when the system is in normal operation, the system being operable to create NC data employing the input data wherein the diagnostic method comprises storing beforehand a data file suitable as said input data to create said NC data, entering an automatic picture advance command to select diagnostic processing, The present invention provides a method of automatically advancing a displayed picture in an automatic programming system for displaying pictures conforming to respective steps of a plurality of data input steps on a display unit in a predeterimined sequence, and creating NC data by using data entered by referring to each picture. The method includes storing data groups as a family program in a non volatile memory in advance, the data groups being entered at each step of automatic programming required to create NC data. Next, the family program is read from the non volatile memory to a RAM, after which an automatic advance command is applied as an input. Diagnostic processing is selected by the above operation. When the automatic advance command is applied, a timer begins clocking time, a display picture for a predetermined step is created at predetermined times by using a question picture and family program data, and the display picture is changed over and displayed at predetermined times. In concurrence with this processing, a parity check is performed with respect to data read out of a RAM, ROM and the like to diagnose a device, particularly a memory. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an automatic programming system which may employ a diagnosing method according to the present invention. Numeral 101 denotes a non volatile memory storing various material files, tooling files, family programs and parameters. Numeral 102 designates a graphic display unit, 103 an operator s panel keyboard , 104 a processor, 105 a ROM storing a control program, 106 a RAM for storing data entered from the operator s panel 103, the results of processing and created NC data, and 107 an NC data output unit for delivering created NC data to an external storage medium 108 such as a paper tape or bubble cassette. The keyboard 103 is provided with various status setting keys, job designating keys R0 through R3 keys , a group of keys used in executing the four arithmatical operations as well as functional operations, and a group of keys for inputting part profiles, numerical values and letters of the alphabet. These keys, however, are not shown. Among the job designating keys, the R0 key is for designating the start of automatic programming and a shift to the next step, and the R3 key is for selecting an auxiliary job when entering an automatic advance command. Fig. 4 is a flowchart of processing illustrating the method of the present invention. Thus, according to the present invention as described above, groups of data entered at each step of automatic programming are stored beforehand as a family program for diagnosis, an automatic advance command is entered, pictures associated with these steps are created at predetermined times in a predetermined sequence in response to the automatic advance command by using the family program data for diagnosis, and the pictures are displayed while being changed over at predetermined times. Accordingly, a series of simulated automatic processing steps can be executed by using the diagnostic family program data without human assistance, and a parity check is performed in concurrence with this processing with respect to data read out of a RAM or ROM, thus enabling the system to be diagnosed automatically.
