# Refueling of nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
Refueling apparatus for a nuclear reactor including a bridge 57 and a trolley 59 . The bridge 57 is moveable on tracks 62, 63 along the containment 55 of the pit 53 in which the reactor is immersed in water and the trolley 59 is moveable in tracks 121, 123 on the bridge 57 at right angles to the tracks 62, 63 on the bridge 57 . The trolley 59 carries a mast assembly 61 for engaging and raising and lowering a nuclear reactor component assembly in volved in the refueling. The bridge 57 , trolley 59 and mast assembly 61 each has a pulse generator which produces pulses in accordance with the movement of each for identification of the position of each. Means are provided for automatic re calibration of the position identifying system. Also, means are provided for containing supply lines for the mast 61 so as to permit undisturbed movement of the mast relative to the trolley 59 .
