The solution or suspension was administered into stomach of monkey two monkeyes with cathetel. After the administration of test compounds, the blood was collected from the lower limbs vein at 2 fixed interval with 2 syringe treated with heparin. The collected blood was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to separate the plasma.The concentration of the test compound was measured by a thin layer cup method a bio assay , wherein Bacillus subtilisATCC 6633 was used as a bacteria for determination. Based on a standard curve, the concentration of test compound in plasma was calculated. The results are shown in Table 14.

The cell solution was intraperitoneally administered to mice one group 10 mice in an amount of 0.5 ml E. coli cells 105 106 cells per each mouse . One hour after the infection, the test compound was crally administered to the mice, and the mice were observed for one week. Based on the number of died and live mice, there was calculated the 50 effective dose ED50 of test compounds by Probit method. The results are shown in Table 5. Table 5 Test compounds ED50 mg kg 11 5.28 14 11.75 Experiment 4 A lactate of Compound 11 was dissolved in water to give a solution of the lactate concentration of lactate 12 mg ml . Separately Compound 11 was suspended in 0.5 aqueous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution concentration of Compound 11 12 mg ml . Rats one group 3 rats were subjected to laparotomy1 and the solution or suspension of the test compounds as prepared above was administered into duodenal tract in a dose of the test compound of 60 mg kg. After the administration, each three rats were killed at an interval of one hour, and blood was collected from vena cava inferior with heparine treated syringe. The blood thus collected was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes, and the plasma was separated. The cencentration of test compounds in blood plasma was measured by Thin Layer Cup method bio assay method detecting microorganism Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 .
