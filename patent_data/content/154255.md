# Device for feeding and positioning recording medium.

## Abstract
A device for feeding and positioning a recording medium as in a radiographic apparatus includes a grip member for gripping, feeding, and positioning the recording medium therein, the grip member being composed of a first plate, a second plate disposed in confronting relation to the first plate and openable at least in an upper end portion thereof with respect to the first plate, and a cover member disposed for closing and opening a gap between lower ends of the first and second plates. The device also includes positioning means for holding the grip member with at least its upper end portion opened in a recording medium receiving position, for displacing the grip member after it has received the recording medium and closing the upper end portion thereof thereby to position the grip member so as to position the recording medium in an exposure position in the grip member, and for displacing the grip member after the recording medium has been exposed thereby to open the cover member for discharging the exposed recording medium out of the grip member.
