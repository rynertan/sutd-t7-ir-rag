# Bearing beam structure.

## Abstract
A bearing beam structure 10 is secured to a cylinder block 12 of an internal combustion engine and includes a plurality of main bearing cap sections 26 each of which associates with each bearing section 22 of the cylinder block so as to rotatably support a crank shaft. At least a beam section 36, 38A, 38B is rigidly connected to the lower end portion of each bearing cap section 26 to securely connect all the bearing cap sections 26 with each other. Additionally, first and second side wall sections 30A, 30B are rigidly connec ted to the opposite side portions of each bearing cap section 26 to securely connect all the bearing cap sections 26 with each other. Accordingly, the bearing beam structure 10 is improved in rigidity to suppress various vibrations of the cylinder block 12 , thereby effectively achieving total engine noise reduction.
