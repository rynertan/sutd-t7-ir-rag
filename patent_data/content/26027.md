# Method for polymerizing alpha olefin.

## Abstract
Poly α olefin having an excellent H.I. is produced with an excellent yield by bringing, in the presence of an organic acid ester, a feed, containing at least one α olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms, into contact with a catalyst which comprises A a solid catalytic ingredient prepared a by reacting a Grig nard compound with an aluminium halide tetraalkoxysilane reaction product, b bringing the resultant reaction product into a first contact with titanium tetrahalide, c treating the resultant titanium containing solid product with an organic acid ester, and, finally, d bringing the treated solid product into a second contact with titanium tetrahalide, and B another catalytic ingredient consisting of a trialkyl aluminium.
