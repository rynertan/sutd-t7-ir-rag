# Means for adding materials to a flowing stream of molten metal.

## Abstract
Apparatus for adding materials and method of control ling the addition of materials, especially powdered or gran ular materials, to a flowing stream 2 , e.g. of molten metal, comprises a nozzle 7 for compressed gas, blowing the additive into the stream and a detector 6 that detects the stream and switches the flow of additive on and off accord ing to whether the stream is present or absent. The detector 6 is preferably of a non contact type, sensing radiation from the stream 2 , preferably visible light. The rate of flow of additive can be adjustable. There can be a failsafe optical detector arrangement 27, 29 monitoring the flow of additive and signalling an alarm if the flow fails or if the nozzle 7 is blocked. The timings of the start and end of the flow in relation to the detection of the metal stream are independently adjustable to ensure that the additive and metal coincide.
