## Description
This invention relates to a method for protecting wool and other proteinaceous fibrous materials against photodegradation by the use of sulfonated 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazine derivatives. Sunlight damages textile materials in several ways. Undyed wool fabrics frequently turn yellow while dyed fabrics may undergo both photoyellowing and dye fading. Sunlight damage also manifests itself as a loss in strength and abrasion resistance of fabrics, a phenomenon generally referred to as phototendering. Wool curtains and automotive upholstery are especially prone to photo tendering, particularly in hot, sunny regions. Prolonged exposure to heat alone also causes wool fabrics to become yellow, albeit at a slower rate than does exposure to sunlight and heat together. It is well known that most synthetic fibres and plastics are damaged by light, and it is commonplace for additives, including ultraviolet absorbers, to be added to these materials before or during fabrication to retard subsequent damage by exposure to sunlight. There are many types of ultraviolet absorber, the 2 hydroxybenzophenones, 2,2 dihydroxybenzophenones and 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles being the most widely known and used. 2 Hydroxyphenyl s triazines are also well known UV absorbers, although they are not widely used. All these UV absorbers are generally believed to function primarily by preferentially absorbing the incident ultraviolet light and dissipating its energy harmlessly, thus minimising damage to the treated fibrous or plastic material. They probably also function by scavenging radical species produced during exposure. The vast majority of UV absorbers are unsulfonated compounds, because their apolar nature makes them more suitable for application to most synthetic fibres and plastics. However, wool, silk and other protein fibres, being polar fibres containing cationic groups, are much more amenable to treatment with sulfonated anionic UV absorbers than with the non sulfonated parent compounds. Sulfonated UV absorbers of the 2 hydroxybenzophenone, 2,2 dihydroxybenzophenone and 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole types have been described previously, and recommended as photoprotective agents for wool, nylon and other polar fibres. Unsulfonated absorbers of the 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazine type are well known see, for example However, sulfonated UV absorbers of the 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazine type are almost unknown, the only examples containing ω sulfoalkyloxy groups see Hydroxyphenyl 1,3,5 triazine derivatives containing sulfonic groups for use as stabilisers for perfumes, soaps, plastic films and photographic gelatin compositions . CIBA Ltd., French Patent 1494413, 8 Sept., 1967 . No claim was made for the use of these compounds on natural or synthetic fibres. The sulfonated 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazines described herein differ from the above compounds in that the sulfonic acid groups are attached directly to aromatic rings. Several of these UV absorbers are more effective photostabilizers for wool against both phototendering and photoyellowing than are any sulfonated 2 hydroxybenzophenones, and are also more effective than most known sulfonated 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles. They also give protection to dyed wool, retarding both phototendering and colour change. This reduction of colour change by the sulfonated 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazines is due to minimized yellowing and reduced dye fading. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method to protect proteinaceous fibrous materials, such as wool, mohair, cashmere and silk, from photoyellowing, phototendering and thermal yellowing, and to protect dyed proteinaceous fibrous materials from both phototendering and colour change. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of protecting proteinaceous fibres and blends thereof against photodegradation and thermal degradation, which comprises treating the fibres under acidic conditions with a sulfonated s triazine derivative of formula I or II wherein wherein In each case the preferred aryl group is phenyl and preferred substituted aryl groups are alkyl substituted phenyl groups. Preferred alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl and i butyl preferred alkali metal is sodium. Preferred sulfonated s triazine derivatives of the formula I are compounds of that formula in which R¹ is a methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, butyloxy or acetoxy group, R² is hydrogen, R³ is a phenyl group or an alkyl substituted phenyl group, and X is sodium. Preferred derivatives of the formula II are compounds of that formula in which R¹ and R⁴ are methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, butyloxy or acetoxy groups, R² and R⁵ are hydrogen, R³ is hydrogen or a sulfonate group, R⁶ is phenyl or alkyl substituted phenyl, and X is sodium. Particularly preferred sulfonated s triazine derivatives for use in the method of this invention are the ammonium, sodium or potassium salts of Fibres found to be especially amenable to the process are wool, mohair, and silk and blends thereof, whether dyed or not. Preferably, the treatment of the fibres is carried out at a pH within the range of 1.5 6. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the following examples which illustrate the extent of photodegradation in wool and silk samples treated with the sulfonated 2 hydroxyphenyl s triazines according to invention. The extent of phototendering was usually determined by measuring the breaking load of unexposed and exposed fabric strips, although in some cases abrasion resistance and tear strengths were also determined. The extent of photoyellowing and thermal yellowing was determined by measurement of yellowness index values on a single thickness of fabric, using a computerised reflectance spectrophotometer Spectrogard Color System, Pacific Scientific Ltd. . The extent of colour change, ΔE CIE Unless otherwise stated in the Examples, the ultraviolet absorbers 5 owf were normally applied to the fabric at 80 C for 90 minutes from an aqueous dyebath liquor wool ratio 60 1 containing sulfuric acid 4 owf using an Ahiba laboratory dyeing machine. Absorber uptakes as measured by optical density changes of the dyebaths ranged from 90 100 . Treated, untreated and control fabric samples 150mm x 100mm were exposed for up to 2000h at a distance of 200mm from a mercury vapor tungsten phosphor lamp Philips ML, 500W type , which is considered to provide irradiation similar to that of sunlight. Fabrics were usually exposed for 2000h at an air temperature of 45 C or for 1000h at 70 C. Sunlight exposures were conducted on fabric samples 150mm x 100mm at the Allunga Exposure Laboratory, a commercial testing facility at Townsville, Queensland. Fabrics were exposed on racks behind window glass inclined at 20 to the horizontal and facing North. Breaking loads were determined in the weft direction on conditioned 20 C, 65 rh fabric strips weft 50mm and warp 25mm rate of extension 50mm min using an Instron tensile tester model TM . Tear strengths were determined by the method described in ASTM, D 2261. Abrasion resistance was measured with a Taber Abraser, as described by P.J.Waters and N.A.Evans An assessment of the data collected in the examples leads to the following general conclusions Most of the sulfonated s triazine derivatives shown in Examples 1 12 were prepared by sulfonating the parent s triazine derivatives, either with chlorosulfonic acid or with fuming sulfuric acid.
