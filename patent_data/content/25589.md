# Process and apparatus for the biological treatment of aqueous waste in a pure oxygen activated sludge ozone system.

## Abstract
A process is provided for the biological treatment of aqueous waste in a pure oxygen activated sludge ozone disinfection system as well as apparatus to accomplish the process. In this process, the off gas 22 from an ozone disinfection tank 53 , after removal of residual ozone, is blended with the pure oxygen stream 23 needed to sup ply the requirements of activated sludge treatment basin and ozonation zone. This blending of two streams 22, 23 is carried out either in pipe line or in a specially built and baffled vessel 56 . The combined stream 24 is then com pressed and split into two portions 25, 26 . One portion 25 of the gas is diverted to the activated sludge treatment plant. The rest 26 of the gas is dried to a dew point level and then fed to ozone generator 61 . The discharge from the ozone generator 61 contains a small percentage of ozone and is routed to the ozone disinfection tank 53 . An alternate of the system, compresses the off gas 22 first and then combines it with pure oxygen stream 23A . A two bed desiccant type dryer 58 should preferably be empolyed for the drying of the gas stream 26 upstream of the ozone generator 61 . A required amount of pure oxygen will be used to purge the inactive bed of the dryer. The wastewater 11 first flows into an oxygenation basin 50 , whereby through the action of microorganisms in the presence of an oxygen rich gas, the organics in the waste water are converted oxidized into harmless compounds. The wastewater is discharged into a settling basin 52 , where the biomass settles to form activated sludge which is returned to the oxygenation basin 50 . The clarified li quid from the settling basin 52 overflows into an ozone contact tank 53 where the ozonated gas 28 is intro duced to disinfect the water stream.
