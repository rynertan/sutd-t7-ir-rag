# Radial arm for a radial arm saw.

## Abstract
A radial arm 16 of a radial arm saw 10 comprises a lightweight metal casting of inverted U cross section and hav ing opposing longitudinal grooves 32, 34 in the inner faces of the side walls 30 of the inverted U. A metal strip 40, 42 of resilient arcuate cross section is press fitted into each groove 32, 34 to form guides for supporting and guiding a power saw unit 18 movable along the radial arm. The low weight of the radial arm 16 is particularly advantageous for a portable radial arm saw, and the inserted metal strips 40, 42 form inexpensive durable guides.
