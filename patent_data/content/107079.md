# Impact modified polymers of cycloolefins.

## Abstract
Impact modified polycycloolefin is made by ring open ing bulk polymerization of at least one monomer containing at least one norbornene group in presence of an organoam monium molybdate or tungstate catalyst and an alkoxy alkylaluminum halide cocatalyst as well as a sufficient amount of a polyolefin powder and a rubbery material to produce ductile polycycloolefin.
