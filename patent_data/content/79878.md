# Rubber compositions and method of treating rubber.

## Abstract
Rubber compositions comprising diene rubber and N carbamoyl maleamic acid, N thiocarbamoyl maleamic acid or derivatives thereof exhibit improved green strength or tack properties. Treatment of diene rubber above 130 C with the same compounds is shown to be effective in obtaining rubber compositions of improved properties.
