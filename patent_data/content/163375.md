# Electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 10 for establishing electrical connection between electrical conductors 16 carried by an inner insulating housing 14 and another circuit element includes an outer insulating housing 12 having slots 48 defined in a wall 26 , the outer housing having an interior chamber 30 adapted to receive the inner insulating housing 14 along sloped surfaces 82a . The housing 14 carries electrical terminals 16 having male portions 44 of sufficient length to extend outwardly from the wall 26 of the outer housing, and female portions 46 disposed within the interior chamber 30 of the outer insulating housing. An end insulating wafer 18 encloses the interior chamber 30 and carries electrical conductors 20 for termination to the female contacts. Wafer 18 includes drive surfaces 84 for contacting the inner housing 14 to force it toward the outer housing wall 26 to an extent sufficient to establish electrical connection between the male contacts 44 and another circuit element. The female socket type contacts 46 disposed within the interior chamber 30 are cammed onto the male contacts 20 of the wafer 18 to provide weak or zero insertion force termination.
