# WABBLE PLATE ENGINE MECHANISM

## Abstract
A wabble plate engine mechanism of the invention includes a cylinder block having a rotatable mainshaft a drive hub obliquely mounted on the mainshaft for rotation therewith a wabble plate rotatably mounted on the drive hub and a plurality of cylinders around the mainshaft, each with a piston reciprocaily movable therein substantially parallel to the mainshaft axis of rotation, each piston being coupled to a respective arm of the wabble plate. In one form, the coupling between at least one piston and its arm comprises a cross head reciprocable in a radial bore in an extension of the piston, and a gudgeon pin on the arm reciprocally movable end wise in a bore of the cross head the cross head bore defining. with each end of the gudgeon pin, a respective cavity with the coupling enabling lubricant liquid access alternately, under some operating conditions for the mechanism, to dampen that end wise movement. In another form, the mechanism includes means for shifting the rotational axis of the wabble plate along that axis of rotation, including a drawing member rotatably mounted on the cylinder block and coupled to the mainshaft so that its rotation draws the mainshaft axially the shifting means including an actuator shaft rotatable parallel to the main shaft, and a drive train between the actuator shaft and the drawing member. In another form, the mechanism includes means for varying the angle of the drive hub, pivotably connected to the drive hub on one side of the mainshaft and to an anchor member on the opposite of the mainshaft. The mechanism also may have first and second weights mounted in diagonally opposed relation on each side of the drive hub and balanced and offset from the mainshaft axis so their centrifugal force is neutralized, and to produce a couple rotating with the mainshaft and about the axis of tilt of the drive hub which is opposite in direction about that tilt axis to the direction of an out of balance couple produced by motion of the pistons and the wabble plate.
