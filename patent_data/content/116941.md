# An X ray diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
An X ray diagnostic apparatus 100 comprises an X ray radiation source 11 for generating an X ray and projecting the same toward an object 21 , an X ray detector 22 for detecting the X ray which has transmitted through the object 21 to derive a total X ray intensity distribution signal of the object 21 including a primary X ray signal component and a scattered X ray signal component caused by scattered X rays and system structural factors, a signal processor 24 which processes the X ray intensity distribution signal detected from the X ray detector 22 in such a manner that a scattered X ray intensity distribution which is pre calculated based upon the X ray intensity distribution signal is elimin ated from an X ray intensity distribution obtained from the X ray intensity distribution signal so as to derive a distribu tion function of the primary X ray signal component without adverse influences on the scattered X ray signal component, and a monitor 25 for displaying a distribution form based upon the distribution function of the primary X ray signal component.
