# FIBER LENGTH INDICATING APPARATUS AND METHODS

## Abstract
A standpipe 31 is connected into a fiber processing system such as a paper making system, containing refined stock, or unrefined pulp, at operating consistencies. Auto matic control cycles a measurement chamber 34 in the standpipe, through intake measure and exhaust. A plate 33 mounted across the measurement chamber has at least one hole 37 of predetermined cross dimension, or diameter, substantially equal to the relative length of fiber desired. Automatic timing establishes a set intake time for slurry, or suspension, to pass through the or each hole 37 and contact lower 68 and or upper 69 level sensors or other level indicators, in the chamber. Read out is provided to indicate too short , too long or correct length with each cycle. Differential pressure, across the or each hole during measure, as well as approach velocity, is appropriate ly controlled.
