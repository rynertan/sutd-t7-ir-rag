# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO APPARATUS FOR SHARPENING CHAIN SAW CHAINS

## Abstract
A chain of a chain saw whose theeth are to be sharpened is mounted in a track 4 of a support table so that it can be in dexed to a central cutting station whereupon a ram 12 will be actuated to reduce the width of the track 4 and grip the chain. A cutting device will then be lowered into contact with a tooth on the chain so as to sharpen that tooth. When the ram 12 is moved to the open condition the chain is indexed forward again by rotating a pusher arm 8 about a pin whilst the pin carried on its own arm is driven in a forward direction. This causes an angled forked plate 10 to engage behind a tooth facing in one direction only of the two possible directions . As the pusher 8 is moved back again a pin 29 rides up over a latch 30 onto the top face of the cam 31 so that the plate 10 can ride over the top of subsequent teeth carried by the chain.
