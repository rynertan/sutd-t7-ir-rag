# IMPROVED ROLL CASTER APPARATUS

## Abstract
An improved roll caster tip apparatus is disclosed comprising a molten metal reservoir 2 having a bottom plate 6 and at least one sidewall 16,18 and a nozzle tip membr 32 attached to the sidewall 16 having a top wall 36 , a bottom wall 40 and a pair of converging side riser member 44,46 between the top wall 36 and the bottom wall 40 forming a converging passageway 50 terminating in an exit port 52 for molten metal to flow from the reservoir 2 to a pair of rollers 60, 62 . The side risers 44,46 converge toward one another at the exit port 52 by being spaced apart a shorter distance at the exit port 52 than at the sidewall 16 of the molten metal reservoir 2 whereby metal flow separation along the side risers 44,46 will be miti gated, thereby providing uniform metal viscosity across the width of the nozzle tip member 32 . Further disclosed is the including of a streamlined spacer member 70 between top 36 and bottom 40 walls of the tip member 32 preselect ing the dimensions of the spacer member 70 and top 36 and bottom 40 walls to provide near Hele Shaw flow conditions and providing a baffle member 24 in the reservoir 2 .
