# Fuel injection pump assembly.

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump assembly includes a single fuel metering valve 60 of the sleeve type cooperating through spill ports 74 with the output of a number of coaxially mounted pump plungers 46 and an equal number of fuel delivery valves 82 , the plungers being moved axially by an engine driven pump 34 that is drive connected by splines 99 and pin 108 and slot 110 type connections to a centrifugal fuel injection timing advance means 112 and to the metering valve 60 permitting the valve to move angularly and axially relative to the pump to provide changes in timing and rate of injection, and a manually operated lever 180 to axially move the metering valve 60 at will to change the fuel flow rate without influence of fuel pressure forces on the valve end and without the necessity of also moving the mass of the first means 112 that changes the injection timing.
