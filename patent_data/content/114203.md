# An image processor.

## Abstract
To process X ray transmission image data at a high speed, a processor 100 comprises a memory section 20 including at least first, second and third storage 22 24 26 the first storage 22 storing the X ray transmission image data in a digital form which is used for medical diagnosis, and the second and third storage 24 26 storing temporarily and exclusively processed the image data, and a processor control section 10 including, at least first, second and third address generators 12 13 14 each of which independently generates an address signal and applies the same to said corresponding storage 22 24 26 respectively, processing circuit 15 which receives the image data and image data which is temporarily stored in one of said second and third storage 24 26 and processes both image data and applies the same for storage purposes to the remaining of said second and third storage 24 26 , and central control circuit 16 having control signal generator 17 which simul taneously applies address control signals to the first, second and third address generators 12 13 14 respectively, storage control signals to the first, second and third storage 22 24 26 respectively, and a control signal to the processing circuit 15 , whereby processing operations in the processing circuit means 15 is effected in parallel, and the resultant processed image data is temporarily stored in the remaining of the second and third storage 24 26 under the control of the central control circuit means 16 .
