## Description
Synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride undergo degradation upon exposure to ultraviolet light, resulting in discoloration, deterioration in mechanical strength and embrittlement. Consequently, various types of stabilizers have been incorporated with these polymers to inhibit such deterioration. However, many of the available stabilizers are unsatisfactory in stabilizing effect, are unstable to heat and subject to oxidation, and are easily extracted from the synthetic polymer composition by water and organic solvents. Some of the available stabilizers impart color to the polymer compositions. Murayama et al U.S. patent No. 3,640,928, patented February 8, 1972, discloses the stabilization of synthetic polymers against photo and thermo deterioration thereof by incorporating therein a piperidine derivative having the general formula The 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidyl compounds are particularly desirable because they do not impart color, and therefore are widely used. However, these compounds are easily volatilized from the polymer composition at elevated temperature, such as during processing, and are also extracted by water. In addition, many are unsatisfactory in their stabilizing effectiveness. Triazines containing 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidyl groups have a considerably improved heat stability and therefore are preferred for many uses.

The product obtained was a glassy solid, melting at 143 147 C. The hydrocarbyl polyphenol poly piperidyl triazines of this invention are effective light stabilizers for polymeric materials that are subject to deterioration when exposed to light. Small amounts are effective. An amount within the range from about 0.001 to about 5 parts, preferably from 0.01 to 3 parts, by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer is usually sufficient. Larger amounts can be used, if desired. Synthetic resins that can have their resistance to deterioration enhanced with the hydrocarbyl polyphenol poly piperidyl triazines according to this invention include α olefin polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, poly 3 methylbutene, or mixtures thereof, and copolymers with other monomers such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer ethylene propylene copolymer polystyrene polyvinyl acetate polyacrylic esters copolymers from styrene and another monomer for example, maleic anhydride, butadiene, and acrylonitrile acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer, acrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copolymer, methacrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copolymer, polymethacrylate esters such as polymethacrylate polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl formal polyvinyl butyral linear polyesters, polyamides polycarbonates polyacetals polyurethanes cellulosic resins phenol formaldehyde resins urea formaldehyde resins melamine formaldehyde resins epoxy resins unsaturated polyester resins silicone resins halogen containing resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, and copolymers thereof, and rubbers such as isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, chloroprene rubber, and blends of any of the above. The hydrocarbyl polyphenol poly piperidyl triazines of the invention can be combined with conventional heat stabilizers such as phenolic antioxidants, polyvalent metal salts of organic acids, organic phosphites, thioethers, and other known heat stabilizers, thereby constituting light and heat stabilizer compositions of the invention. The phenolic antioxidant contains one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups, and one or more phenolic nuclei, and can contain from about eight to about three hundred carbon atoms. In addition, the phenolic nucleus can contain an oxy or thio ether group The alkyl substituted phenols and polynuclear phenols, because of their molecular weight, have a higher boiling point, and therefore are preferred because of their lower volatility. There can be one or a plurality of alkyl groups of one or more carbon atoms. The alkyl group or groups including any alkylene groups between phenol nuclei preferably aggregate at least four carbon atoms. The longer the alkyl or alkylene chain, the better the compatibility with polypropylene, inasmuch as the phenolic compound then acquires more of an aliphatic hydrocarbon character, and therefore there is no upper limit on the number of alkyl carbon atoms. Usually, from the standpoint of availability, the compound will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in an alkyl, alicyclidene and alkylene group, and a total of not over about fifty carbon atoms. The compounds may have from one to four alkyl radicals per phenol nucleus. The phenol contains at least one and preferably at least two phenolic hydroxyls, the two or more hydroxyls being in the same ring, if there is only one. In the case of bicyclic phenols, the rings can be linked by thio or oxyether groups, or by alkylene, alicyclidene or arylidene groups. The monocyclic phenols which can be employed have the structure R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halogen and organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, and acyl where R is aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl. The polycyclic phenol phenol is one having at least two aromatic nuclei linked by a polyvalent linking radical, as defined by the formula wherein Ar is a phenolic nucleus which can be a phenyl or a polycarbocyclic group having condensed or separate phenyl rings each Ar group contains at least one free phenolic hydroxyl group up to a total of five. The Ar rings can also include additional rings connected by additional linking nuclei of the type Y, for example, Ar Y Ar Y Ar. The aromatic nucleus Ar can, in addition to phenolic hydroxyl groups, include one or more inert substituents. Examples of such inert substituents include hydrogen, halogen atoms, e.g., chlorine, bromine and fluorine organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy and acyloxy where R is aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl, or thiohydrocarbon groups having from one to about thirty carbon atoms, and carboxyl groups. Usually, however, each aromatic nucleus will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in any hydrocarbon substituent group. The Ar group can have from one to four substituent groups per nucleus. Typical aromatic nuclei include phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthryl, triphenylenyl,anthracenyl, pyrenyl, chrysenyl, and fluoroenyl groups. When Ar is a benzene nucleus, the polyhydric polycyclic phenol has the structure wherein Preferably, the hydroxyl groups are located ortho and or para to Y. Exemplary Y groups are alkylene, alkylidene, and alkenylene arylene, alkyl arylene, arylalkylene cycloalkylene, cycloalkylidene and oxa and thia substituted such groups tetrahydrofuranes, esters and triazino groups. The Y groups are usually bi, tri, or tetravalent, connecting two, three or four Ar groups. However, higher valency Y groups connecting more than four Ar groups, can also be used. According to their constitution, the Y groups can be assigned to subgenera as follows Although the relation of effectiveness to chemical structure is insufficiently understood, many of the most effective phenols have Y groups of subgenus 1 , and accordingly this is preferred. Some of these phenols can be prepared by the alkylation of phenols or alkyl phenols with polyunsaturated hydrocarbons such as dicyclopentadiene or butadiene. Representative phenols include guaiacol, resorcinol monoacetate, vanillin, butyl salicylate, 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methyl phenol, 2 tert butyl 4 methoxy phenol, 2,4 dinonyl phenol, 2,3,4,5 tetradecyl phenol, tetrahydro α naphthol, o , m and p cresol, o , m and p phenylphenol, o , m and p xylenols, the carvenols, symmetrical xylenol, thymol, o , m and p nonylphenol, o , m and p dodecyl phenol, and o , m and p octyl phenol, o , and m tert butyl p hydroxy anisole, p n decyloxy phenol, p n decyloxy cresol, nonyl n decyloxy cresol eugenol, isoeugenol, glyceryl monosalicylate, methyl p hydroxy cinnamate, 4 benzyloxy phenol, p acetylaminophenol, p stearyl aminophenol, methyl p hydroxybenzoate, p di chlorobenzoyl aminophenol, p hydroxysalicyl anilide, stearyl 3,5 di methyl 4 hydroxy benzyl thioglycolate, stearyl β 4 hydroxy 3,5 di t butylphenyl propionate, distearyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphonate, and distearyl 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 5 t butyl benzylmalonate.

A particularly desirable class of polyhydric polycyclic phenols are the dicyclopentadiene polyphenols, which are of the type in which The polyhydric polycyclic phenols used in the invention can also be condensation products of phenols or alkylphenols with hydrocarbons having a bicyclic ring structure and a double bond or two or more double bonds, such as α pinene, β pinene, dipentene, limonene, vinylcyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, allo ocimene, isoprene and butadiene. These condensation products are usually obtained under acidic conditions in the form of more or less complex mixtures of monomeric and polymeric compounds. However, it is usually not necessary to isolate the individual constituents. The entire reaction product, merely freed from the acidic condensation catalyst and unchanged starting material, can be used with excellent results. While the exact structure of these phenolic condensation products is uncertain, the Y groups linking the phenolic nuclei all fall into the preferred subgenus 1. For method of preparation, see e.g., U.S. patent No. 3,124,555, U.S. patent No. 3,242,135, and British patent No. 961,504. When the stabilizer composition is used in conjunction with a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid, the organic acid will ordinarily have from about six to about twenty four carbon atoms. The polyvalent metal can be any metal of Group II of the Periodic Table, such as zinc, calcium, cadmium, barium, magnesium and strontium. The alkali metal salts and heavy metal salts such as lead salts are unsatisfactory. The acid can be any organic non nitrogenous monocarboxylic acid having from six to twenty four carbon atoms. The aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic and oxygen containing heterocyclic organic acids are operable as a class. By the term aliphatic acid is meant any open chain carboxylic acid, substituted, if desired, with nonreactive groups, such as halogen, sulfur and hydroxyl. By the term alicyclic it will be understood that there is intended any cyclic acid in which the ring is nonaromatic and composed solely of carbon atoms, and such acids may if desired have inert, nonreactive substituents such as halogen, hydroxyl, alkyl radicals, alkenyl radicals and other carbocyclic ring structures condensed therewith. The oxygen containing heterocyclic compounds can be aromatic or nonaromatic and can include oxygen and carbon in the ring structure, such as alkyl substituted furoic acid The aromatic acids likewise can have nonreactive ring substituents such as halogen, alkyl and alkenyl groups, and other saturated or aromatic rings condensed therewith. As exemplary of the acids which can be used in the form of their metal salts there can be mentioned the following hexoic acid, 2 ethylhexoic acid, n octoic acid, isooctoic acid, capric acid, undecylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, behenic acid, chlorocaproic acid, hydroxy capric acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, butyl benzoic acid, ethyl benzoic acid, propyl benzoic acid, hexyl benzoic acid, salicylic acid, naphthoic acid, 1 naphthalene acetic acid, orthobenzoyl benzoic acid, naphthenic acids derived from petroleum, abietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, hexahydrobenzoic acid, and methyl furoic acid. The water insoluble salts are preferred, because they are not leached out when the plastic is in contact with water. Where these salts are not known, they are made by the usual types of reactions, such as by mixing the acid, or anhydride with the corresponding oxide or hydroxide of the metal in a liquid solvent, and heating, if necessary, until salt formation is complete. A variety of organic triphosphites and acid phosphites can be employed, of which the following are exemplary. The organic triphosphite can be any organic phosphite having three or more organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. The acid phosphite can be any organic phosphite having one or two organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. These radicals can be monovalent radicals, in the case of the triphosphites, diphosphites and monophisphites. The organic triphosphites in which the radicals are monovalent radicals can be defined by the formula in which The acid phosphites are defined by the same formula, but one or two of R₁, R₂ and R₃ is hydrogen or a cation of a metal or ammonium. Also included are the organic triphosphites having a bivalent organic radical forming a heterocyclic ring with the phosphorus of the type in which Also useful organic triphosphites are mixed heterocyclic open chain phosphites of the type More complex triphosphites are formed from trivalent organic radicals, of the type in which A particularly useful class of complex triphosphites are the tetraoxadiphosphaspiro undecanes of the formula where In the case of the acid phosphites, one or both of R₁ and R₂ is also hydrogen or a cation. An especially preferred class of organic triphosphites and acid phosphites have a bicyclic aromatic group attached to phosphorus through oxygen, with no or one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups on either or both of the aromatic rings. These phosphites are characterized by the formula in which is one or a plurality of organic radicals as defined above for R₁ to R₆, taken singly or together in sufficient number to satisfy the valences of the two phosphite oxygen atoms. One or both radicals is also hydrogen, in the case of the acid phosphites, and can include additional bicyclic aromatic groups of the type HO The cation in the case of acid phosphites can be a metal, such as an alkali metal, for instance, sodium, potassium or lithium an alkaline earth metal, for instance, barium, calcium, or a nontoxic polyvalent metal, such as magnesium, tin and zinc. Usually, the triphosphites and acid phosphites will not have more than about sixty carbon atoms.

The thiodipropionic acid ester has the following formula The molecular weights of the R and Y radicals are taken such that with the remainder of the molecule the thiodipropionic ester has a total of from about ten to about sixty carbon atoms per sulfur atom. Accordingly, the various thiodipropionic acid ester species coming within the above designated categories within the general formula can be defined as follows In the above formulae R₁ and R₂, M, X and Z are the same as before and the value of n, can range upwards from 1, but there is no upper limit on n₁ except as is imposed by the ratio of carbon atoms, as stated below. In the polymer c , as in the other forms of thiodipropionic acid esters, the total number of carbon atoms per sulfur atom is within the range from about ten to about sixty. The R radical of these esters is important in furnishing compatibility with the polymer. The Y radical is desirably a different radical, R₂ or M or a polymer, where R is rather low in molecular weight, so as to compensate for this in obtaining the optimum compatibility and nonvolatility. Where Y is a metal, the thiodipropionic acid ester furnishes the beneficial properties of the polyvalent metal salt which is described above. The aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, and cycloalkyl groups may, if desired, contain inert, nonreactive substituents such as halogen and other carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring structures condensed therewith. Typical R radicals are, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, amyl, isoamyl, n octyl, isooctyl, 2 ethyl hexyl, t octyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, allyl, hexenyl, linoleyl, ricinoleyl, oleyl, phenyl, xylyl, tolyl, ethylphenyl, naphthyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, cyclopentyl, methylcyclohexyl, ethylcyclohexyl, and naphthenyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, glyceryl, sorbityl, pentaerythrityl, and polyoxyalkylene radicals such as those derived from diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyoxypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, and polyoxypropyleneoethylene glycol, and esters thereof with any of the organic acids named below in the discussion of the polyvalent metal salts including in addition those organic acids having from two to five carbon atoms, such as acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids. Typical X radicals are alkylene radicals such as ethylene, tetramethylene, hexamethylene, decamethylene, alkyl substituted alkylene radicals such as 1,2 propylene, arylene radicals such as phenylene methylenephenylene dimethylene phenylene and alicyclylene such as cyclohexylene and cyclopentylene As exemplary of the thiodipropionic acid esters which can be used, there can be mentioned the following monolauryl thiodipropionic acid, dilauryl thiodipropionate, butyl stearyl thiodipropionate, 2 ethylhexyl lauryl thiodipropionate, di 2 ethylhexyl thiodipropionate, diisodecyl thiodipropionate, isodecyl phenyl thiodipropionate, benzyl lauryl thiodipropionate, benzyl phenyl thiodipropionate, the diester of mixed coconut fatty alcohols and thiodipropionic acid, the diester of mixed tallow fatty alcohols and thiodipropionic acid, the acid ester of mixed cottonseed oil fatty alcohols and thiodipropionic acid, the acid ester of mixed soyabean oil fatty alcohols and thiodipropionic acid, cyclohexyl nonyl thiodipropionate, monooleyl thiodipropionic acid, hydroxyethyl lauryl thiodipropionate, monoglyceryl thiodipropionic acid, glyceryl monostearate monothiodipropionate, sorbityl isodecyl thiodipropionate, the polyester of diethylene glycol and thiodipropionic acid, the polyester of triethylene glycol and thiodipropionic acid, the polyester of hexamethylene glycol and thiodipropionic the polyester of pentaerythritol and thiodipropionic acid, the polyester of octamethylene glycol and thiodipropionic acid, the polyester of p dibenzyl alcohol and thiodipropionic acid ethylbenzyl lauryl thiodipropionate, strontium stearyl thiodipropionate, magnesium oleyl thiodipropionate, calcium dodecylbenzyl thiodipropionate, and mono dodecylbenzyl thiodipropionic acid. These esters are for the most part known compounds, but where they are not available, they are readily prepared by esterification of thiodipropionic acid and the corresponding alcohol. Also useful are β Alkylthiopropionic acid esters having the general formula wherein Pentaerythritol tetra dodecyl thio propionate is an example of this group. Other conventional light stabilizers can be employed, such as hydroxybenzophenones such as 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone, 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxy benzophenone, 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone, benzotriazoles, such as 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazoles, 2 2 hydroxy 3 t butyl 5 methylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy 3 5 di t butylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy 3,5 di t amylphenyl benzotriazole, benzoates such as phenylsalicylate, 2,4 di t butylphenyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenylbenzoate, nickel compounds such as nickel 2,2 thiobis 4 t octyl phenolate , nickel mono ethyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl phosphonate, substituted acrylonitriles such as methyl α cyano β methyl β p methoxyphenyl acrylate and oxalic anilides such as N 2 ethyl phenyl N 2 ethoxy 5 t butyl phenyl oxalic diamide, N 2 ethyl phenyl N 2 ethoxy phenyl oxalic diamide. A sufficient amount of the stabilizer or combination is used to improve the resistance of the synthetic polymer to deterioration in physical properties when exposed to heat and light, including, for example, discoloration, reduction in melt viscosity and embrittlement. Very small amounts are usually adequate. Amounts within the range from about 0.001 to about 5 total stabilizers including the hydrocarbyl polyphenol poly piperidyl triazines of the invention by weight of the polymer are satisfactory. Preferably, from 0.01 to 3 is employed for optimum stabilization. The stabilizer systems of the invention are readily rendered in solid particulate form, comprising a blend of The hydrocarbyl polyphenol poly piperidyl triazines light stabilizer of the invention can be employed in combination with phenolic antioxidant and or other conventional heat and light stabilizers for the particular synthetic polymer. Thus, for example, in the case of polyvinyl chloride resins, other polyvinyl chloride resin heat stabilizers can be included, including polyvalent metal fatty acid salts such as barium and cadmium salts, of the higher fatty acids organotin compounds and epoxy compounds and organic phosphites. With polyolefin resins there can be employed fatty aid salts of polyvalent metals, and the higher fatty acid esters of thiodipropionic acids, such as, for example dilauryl thiodipropionate. With polyamide resin compositions, polyamide stabilizers such as copper salts in combination with iodides and or other phosphorus compounds and salts of divalent manganese can be used. With synthetic rubbers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene terpolymers, other antioxidants and polyvalent metal salts of the higher fatty acids can be used. In addition, other conventional additives for synthetic polymers, such as plasticizers, lubricants, emulsifiers, anti static agents, flame proofing agents, pigments and fillers, can be employed. The stabilizer or combination is incorporated in the polymer in suitable mixing equipment, such as a mill or a Banbury mixer. If the polymer has a melt viscosity which is too high for the desired use, the polymer can be worked until its melt viscosity has been reduced to the desired range before addition of the stabilizer. Mixing is continued until the mixture is substantially uniform. The resulting composition is then removed from the mixing equipment and brought to the size and shape desired for marketing or use. The stabilized polymer can be worked into the desired shape, such as by milling, calendering, extruding or injection molding or fiber forming. In such operations, it will be found to have a considerably improved resistance to reduction in melt viscosity during the heating, as well as a better resistance to discoloration and embrittlement on ageing and heating.
