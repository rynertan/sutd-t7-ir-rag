# Alignment method for reduction projection type aligner.

## Abstract
An alignment method for reduction projection type aligner is disclosed in which the rough detection of reticle po sition in the reticle alignment process at the time of mounting a reticle 1 and the fine detection of reticle position in the wafer alignment for the alignment between a wafer 3 and the reticle 1 are pertormed automatically by the same reticle alignment pattern 18 and the same optical alignment detection system 38 . A plurality of one or two dimensional Fresnel zone plates 19, 20 having different shapes of diffraction patterns formed outside of a reticle circuit pattern 16 and arranged at a posi tion outward of the entrance pupil 2 of the reduction projec tion lens 2 are used as a a reticle alignment pattern 18 to detect the absolute position of the reticle 1 . The detection field of view of the optical alignment detection system 38 is thus effectively widened to make pattern detection possible with high magnification for an improved detection accuracy. The same reticle alignment pattern 18 and the same optical alignment detection system 38 are used for rough detection of reticle position in reticle alignment and fine detection of reti cle position in wafer alignment. In the optical alignment detec tion system 38 , on the other hand, the image position of the diffraction pattern 39a to 39c from the reticle alignment pat tern 18 and the image position of the wafer alignment pattern 14 are located at the same distance from the recticle surface.
