# A control for a single phase AC motor.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to control apparatus and particu larly to a triggered switch 18 connected in a first or controlled circuit and a trigger device 23 connected in a second or main circuit. Alternating currents AC flow through the first and second circuits and there is a changing phase angle between the currents. Further, the current level in the second or main circuit changes. When the phase angle is greater than a cer tain value and the current level in the second circuit is above a certain level, the trigger device 23 triggers the switch 18 and energizes the first circuit. At angles below the value and current levels below the certain level, the switch 18 is not triggered. Thus, the changing phase angle may be utilized to control the first circuit. The triggered switch 18 is a thyrister type of device such as a triac, and the trigger device 23 is preferably a reed switch 26, 27 . The control apparatus is particularly useful in controlling the start winding 11 of a single phase AC motor.
