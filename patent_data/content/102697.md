# A timing control system in a data processor.

## Abstract
A timing control system in a data processor, wherein there is defined a dummy instruction including at least a first control field 11 indicating a dummy instruction and a second control field 12 indicating a number of dummy cycles and there is provided a decoder means 16 which is arranged to detect a dummy instruction by decoding said first field 11 , a counter means 20 connected to said decoder means 16 wherein an initial value depending on a value of said second field 12 is set when a dummy instruction is detected, the counter means 20 being up dated for each specified cycle, and a detector means 21 which is connected to said counter means 20 and outputs a signal indicating the end of said dummy instruction when said counter value reaches the specified value, whereby a time corresponding to a desired number of cycles will be protected reserved by such a dummy instruction.
