## Description
The present invention relates to a time switch in a time division switching network, such as known from FR A 2 180 171, which also performs a bit rate conversion in addition to multiplexing or multi separation. In a present day digital telephone network, a speech signal is exchanged and is transmitted as a 64 Kb s digital signal having a period of 125 Âµs and data of 8 bits period. Accordingly, a time division switching network for the digital telephone network is usually designed to perform exchange at 64 Kb s. On the other hand, in order to economically cope with a service for a facsimile communication or a data communication which is operated at lower than 64 Kb s, a multi digital network operated at a multi bandwidth of 8 Kb s x N N 1, 2, 4, 8 has been desired. Fig. 1 shows a configuration of a channel of a prior art time division switching network for the multi bandwidth digital network. Numeral 1 denotes a time division switch of T time switch x S space switch x T time switch configuration, numeral 2 denotes a bearer universal multiplex converter for converting a bearer multiplex signal from a transmission line 101 signal multiplexed at a bearer speed inherent to a terminal to a universal signal basic speed signal for the time division switching derived by speed converting the bearer signal, e.g. 64 Kb s signal , and numeral 3 denotes a universal bearer multiplex converter for converting the universal signal to a bearer multiplex signal to send it out to a transmission line 104. On the transmission path 101, 8 N channels of 8 Kb s x N N 1, 2, 4 signals are multiplexed to one time slot of 64 Kb s. As a matter of course, the bearer multiplexing does not occur at the bearer speed of 64 Kb s N 8 . The bearer universal multiplex converter 2 converts the inputs thereto to N universal signals 64 Kb s and sends them out to an internal highway 102. The universal signals are switched in the time division switch 1 at 64 Kb s and then supplied to the universal bearer multiplex converter 3 through an internal highway 103 and re converted to the bearer multiplex signals and sent out to the transmission line 104. The multiplex converters 2 and 3 are now explained in detail. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of one example of the bearer universal multiplex converter. Numeral 21 denotes a demultiplexer, numerals 22, 23 and 24 denote converters for converting the 8 Kb s x 8 bearer multiplex signals to the universal signals 64 Kb s x 8, the 16 Kb s x 4 bearer multiplex signals to the universal signals x 4, and the 32 Kb s x 2 bearer multiplex signals to the universal signals x 2, respectively, and numeral 25 denotes a multiplexer. The transmission line 101 comprises a time slot 1 which is bearer multiplexed at 8 Kb s x 8, a time slot 2 which is bearer multiplexed at 16 Kb s x 4, a time slot 3 of 32 Kb s x 2 and a time slot 4 for a signal of the bearer speed of 64 Kb s. The demultiplexer 21 separates the signals to the time slots 1 to 4 and outputs them to lines 26, 27, 28 and 29. The converters 22, 23 and 24 are provided for the bearer speeds of 8 Kb s, 16 Kb s and 32 Kb s, respectively, and separate the bearer multiplex signals and convert the bearer speed to the universal signal 64 Kb s and send them out to lines 26A, 27A and 28A. The universal signals are then multiplexed by the multiplexer 25 and sent out to the internal highway 102. The signal at the bearer speed of 64 Kb s need not be speed converted and it is directly supplied to the multiplexer 25 from the separator 21. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of one example of the universal bearer multiplex converter. Numeral 31 denotes a demultiplexer, numerals 32, 33 and 34 denote converter for converting the universal signals x 8 to the 8 Kb s x 8 bearer multiplex signals, the universal signal x 4 to the 16 Kb s x 4 bearer multiplex signals and the universal signals x 2 to the 32 Kb s x 2 bearer multiplex signals, respectively, and numeral 35 denotes a multiplexer. The internal highway 103 comprises universal signal time slots 1 to 8 for signals of the bearer speed of 8 Kb s, universal signal time slots 9 to 12 for signals of the bearer speed of 16 Kb s, universal signal time slots 13 and 14 for signals of the bearer speed of 32 Kb s and a time slot 15 for the signal of the bearer speed of 64 Kb s. The demultiplexer 31 separates the signals to the time slots 1 to 15 and sends out the signals of the time slots 1 to 8 to lines 36, the signals of the time slots 9 to 12 to lines 37, the signals of the time slots 13 and 14 to lines 38, and the signal of the time slot 15 to a line 39. The converters 32, 33 and 34 are provided for the bearer speeds of 8 Kb s, 16 Kb s and 32 Kb s, respectively, and bit rate convert the universal signals to the bearer signals and bearer multiplex the signals at 64 Kb s. The 64 Kb s bearer multiplex signals are then sent out to lines 36A, 37A and 38A and they are multiplexed with the 64 Kb s signal on the line 39 by the multiplexer 35 and sent out to the transmission line 104. In the prior art network, the multiplex converters 2 and 3 which are fairly complex are required before and after the time division switch 1. Accordingly, the network is ineconomic and cannot flexibly cope with a traffic variation among the bearer speeds because the time slot is fixedly allotted to each bearer rate signal. This is due to the fact that the time division switch 1 is of T x S x T configuration and designed to switch only at the basic speed of 64 Kb s, and the time switch T has only a time slot exchange function at 64 Kb s and has no function of the bit rate conversion between the bearer signal and the universal signal and no function of bearer multiplexing and bearer separation. It is an object of the present invention to provide an economic time switch which does not need special unit for a speed conversion between a bearer signal and a universal signal and bearer multiplexing. It is another object of the present invention to provide a time switch having a flexibility to a traffic variation of bearer signals. It is other object of the present invention to provide a time division switch which is simple in construction and easy to control. The time switch of the present invention comprises a speech path memory or channel memory which write a data from an incoming highway by designating a fixed address for a time slot and reads out the data by designating a variable address for a time slot of an outgoing highway, a converter for converting the read data to a universal signal in accordance with a conversion mode designation, and a control memory for storing the variable address designation to the channel memory and the conversion mode designation to the converter in a synchronized mode. In summary, the channel memory is sequentially written and randomly read to allow multi distribution to a plurality of time slots, and the multi distributed signals are converted to the universal signals for each time slot by the converter. By using the time switch as a first stage switch of the switching network, the bearer universal multiplex converter 2 in the prior art system is eliminated and the system is significantly economized. The time switch of the present invention also comprises a speech path memory or channel memory which writes a data from an incoming highway at a designated bit position by designating a variable address for a time slot and reads out the data by designating a fixed address for a time slot of an outgoing highway, a write control circuit for designating a write bits position of the speech path memory in accordance with a write mode designation, and a control memory for storing the variable address designation to the speech path memory and the write mode designation to the write control circuit. In summary, the speech path memory is randomly written and sequentially read and the writing is variably controlled bit by bit to convert the universal signals to the bearer multiplex signals. Accordingly, by using the time switch as a final stage of the switching network, the universal bearer multiplex converter 3 of the prior art system is eliminated and the system is significantly economized. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Embodiments of a T S T time division switch of the present invention are explained with reference to the drawings. An embodiment of a first stage time switch of the present invention is first explained with reference to Figs. 4 and 5 which show a connection and a signal flow. In Fig. 4, numeral 110 denotes an 8 bit shift register, numeral 111 denotes an 8 bit register, numeral 112 denotes an 8 bit 16 word speech path memory, numeral 113 denotes a converter, numeral 114 denotes an 8 bit register, numeral 115 denotes a counter and numeral 116 denotes a 9 bit 16 word control memory. Waveforms shown in Fig. 5 are designated by the same numerals as the line numbers of Fig. 4. An incoming highway 201 is a 256 Kb s highway to which four time slots TS0 TS3 each consisting of 8 bits are multiplexed at 8 kHz period. Data on the incoming highway 201 is stored in the shift register 110 by a clock 202, and after one time slot shift, parallelly loaded to the register 111 by a clock 203. The content of the register 111 is written into the speech path memory 112 by a clock 209 in accordance with an address 0 3 specified by the counter 115. The time slots TS0 TS3 correspond to the addresses 0 3, respectively. Fixed address designation. On the other hand, the speech path memory 112 is read out in accordance with the content of the control memory 116. A read address 215 of the control memory 116 corresponds to the time slot number to be connected to an outgoing highway 208 variable address designation and the control memory 116 contains the time slot numbers of the incoming highway 201 and conversion modes of the converter 113. The data of the incoming highway 201 written into the channel memory 112 is read out in accordance with a time slot designation 217 of the incoming highway 201 read out of the control memory 116. This data is converted to a universal signal in the converter 113 by a conversion mode designation 216 read out of the control memory 116 and the universal signal is loaded to the register 114 by a clock 210 and outputted to the outgoing highway 208. Let us assume that two data A and B of bearer rate of 32 Kb s are multiplexed on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 and they are separated to the time slots TS6 and TS7 of the outgoing highway 208 to convert them to the universal signals. The time switch operates in the following manner. The operation comprises the switching of the data A on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 to the time slot TS6 of the outgoing highway 208 to convert it to the universal signal and the switching of the data B on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 to the time slot TS7 of the outgoing highway 208 to convert it to the universal signal. Fig. 6 shows a format of a connection command supplied to the control memory 116. Fig. 7 shows a conversion truth table which shows a relation between a conversion mode coding and a truth value of the converter 113. The converter 113 produces outputs Yâ Yâ for inputs Xâ Xâ in accordance with the conversion mode designated by bits Iâ Iâ. Fig. 8 shows a block diagram of the converter 113 which converts the signal in accordance with the truth value. Numerals 220 226 denote 2 input 1 output selectors and numerals 227 234 denote 4 input 1 output selectors. They select the signals in accordance with control inputs Câ Câ. The operations at the bearer rates other than that described above will be readily understood from Figs. 6 and 7 and hence they are not explained. A control unit not shown, of the switching network designates out time slots WA1 WA4 , in time slots Iâ Iâ and conversion modes Iâ Iâ bit rate class and bit position designation see Fig. 6 by an address bus 212 and a data bus 211 and writes the connection command into the control memory 116 by a write signal to a clock line 213. The data 000110000 is written at an address 0110 of the control memory 116 by the first connection command, and the data 000110001 is written at an address 0111 by the second connection command. Thus, the content 000110000 of the control memory 116 at the address 0110 is read out at a timing corresponding to the time slot TS6 of the outgoing highway 208. As a result, as shown in Fig. 4, high order four bits Oâ Oâ 0001 corresponding to the in time slot are supplied to read addresses RA1 RA4 of the channel memory 112 through a line 217, and low order five bits Oâ Oâ 10000 corresponding to the conversion mode are supplied to control signals Câ Câ of the converter 113 through a line 216. The high order two bits OâOâ 10 of the conversion mode designation data correspond to the bearer rate of 32 Kb s, and 00 correspond to the bit rate class of 8 Kb s, 01 to the bit rate class of 16 Kb s and 11 to the bit rate class of 64 Kb s. When the data a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 is read out from the channel memory 112 by the in time slot designation data 0001 and supplied to the inputs Xâ Xâ of the converter 113 through the line 206, the data aa cc ee gg is produced from the outputs Yâ Yâ in accordance with the conversion bit position designation Iâ 0 and loaded to the register 114 by the clock 210. Thus, the data at 32 Kb s corresponding to even numbered bits on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 is outputted to the time slot TS6 of the outgoing highway 208 as the universal signal at 64 Kb s. Similarly, the data at 32 Kb s corresponding to the odd numbered bits on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 201 is outputted to the time slot TS7 of the outgoing highway 208 as the universal signal at 64 Kb s. In the present embodiment, the multiplexity of the incoming highway 201 m is four and the multiplexity of the outgoing highway 208 n is 16 and hence m n. The connection function is attainable with m n or m n within an allowable range of block factor. As seen from the above embodiment, the initial stage time switch of the present invention can handle the signals of a multiple of bearer rates by merely expanding the bit width of the memory and adding the code converter to the prior art time switch. Accordingly, the time division switch is significantly economized. Further, since the traffic quantity to be handled depends only on the total traffics and does not depend on the traffic ratio of the individual bearer rate signals, a high flexibility to the traffic variation among the individual bearer rate signals is attained. An embodiment of the final stage time switch of the present invention is now explained with reference to Figs. 9 and 10 which show a configuration and a signal flow. In Fig. 9, numeral 310 denotes an 8 bit shift register, numeral 311 denotes an 8 bit register, numeral 312 denotes an 8 bit 4 word channel memory, numeral 313 denotes a write control circuit, numeral 314 denotes an 8 bit register, numeral 315 denotes a counter and numeral 316 denotes a 7 bit 16 word control memory. Waveforms in Fig. 10 are designated by the same numerals as the line numbers in Fig. 9. An incoming highway 401 is a 1024 Kb s highway on which 16 time slots TS0 TS15 each consisting of 8 bits are multiplexed at 8 kHz period, and it is connected to the outgoing highway 208 of Fig. 4 through a space switch. The data on the incoming highway 401 is stored in the shift register 310 by a clock 402, and the content of the shift register 310 is shifted by one time slot and then parallelly loaded to the register 311 by a clock 403. The control memory 316 contains write addresses to the channel memory 312 and write modes for designating write bit positions and bit rate classes, for the data on the incoming highway 401 loaded to the register 311, for each time slot of the incoming highway 401. The counter 315 sends out a count representing the time slot number of the incoming highway 401 to an address line 415 to determine the read address of the control memory 316. The read data designates the write address of the channel memory 312 through a line 417. Variable address designation. The other read data is supplied to the write control circuit 313 through a line 416 so that the write control circuit 313 produces a write bit designation 407. Of the data on the incoming highway 401, only those bits which are designated by the line 407 are written into the address of the channel memory 312 designated by the line 417. On the other hand, the channel memory 312 is sequentially read out in accordance with an output 414 of the counter 315 fixed address designation , and the read data is loaded to the register 314 at a timing of a clock 410. Let us assume that signals having bearer rate of 32 Kb s and converted to 64 Kb s universal signals are allotted to the time slots TS1 and TS2 of the incoming highway 401 and those signals are multiplexed to the time slot TS3 of the outgoing highway 408. The operation of the present time switch is now explained in detail. The operations for other cases can be readily understood from Figs. 11 and 12. Fig. 11 shows a format of a connection command sent to the control memory 316. Fig. 12 shows a truth table of the write control circuit 313 which shows a relation between the bit rate class, and the write mode and the enable signal. A symbol X in Fig. 12 indicates that either 1 or 0 is allowed. A control unit, not shown, of the switching method designates in time slots WA1 WA4 , out time slots Iâ, Iâ and write modes Iâ Iâ bit rate class and bit position designation by the address bus 412 and the data bus 411 Fig. 11 , and writes the connection command to the control memory 316 by the write signal to the clock line 413. The data 1010000 is written at the address 0001 of the control memory 316 by the first connection command, and the data 1010001 is written at the address 0010 by the second connection command. Thus, the data 1010000 at the address 0001 of the control memory 316 is read out at a timing corresponding to the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 401. As a result, as shown in Fig. 9, the high order two bits Oâ, Oâ 10 corresponding to the out time slot are supplied to the write addresses WA1, WA2 of the channel memory 312 through the line 417. The high order two bits Oâ, Oâ 10 of the write mode designation data correspond to the bearer rate class of 32 Kb s, and 00 corresponds to the bit rate class of 8 Kb s, 01 to the bit rate class of 16 Kb s and 11 to the bit rate class of 64 Kb s. The low order five bits Oâ Oâ 10000 corresponding to the write mode are supplied to control inputs Câ Câ of the write control circuit 313. The write control circuit 313 produces 1 s at enable terminals G1, G3, G5 and G7 of the channel memory 312, and 0 s at enable terminals G2, G4, G6 and G8, in accordance with the truth table of Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 10, the data aa cc ee gg on the time slot TS1 of the incoming highway 401 is supplied to the inputs Iâ Iâ of the channel memory 312 by the time slot designation data 0001 , and only those bits whose enable signals G1 G8 are 1 , that is, only the odd numbered bits a c e g are written at the address 2. Similarly, the even numbered bit data b d f h in the data bb dd ff hh on the time slot TS2 of the incoming highway 401 is written at the address 2 of the channel memory 312 in accordance with the second connection command. As a result, the data a b c d e f g h which was derived by bearer multiplexing the 32 Kb s data on the time slots TS1 and TS2 is written at the address 2 of the channel memory 312. The data at the address 2 of the channel memory 312 is read out at a timing corresponding to the time slot TS2 of the outgoing highway 408. In the present embodiment, the channel memory 312 has a gate function enable terminals G1 G8 which allows selective writing bit by bit, but the same function may be attained with a memory having no such function. Fig. 13 is a block diagram of the channel memory in other embodiment of the final stage time switch of the present invention. It may substitute for the channel memory 312 of Fig. 9. Numeral 512 denotes the channel memory, numeral 512A denotes a channel memory device, and numerals 512B and 512C denote selectors. The like signal lines to those shown in Fig. 9 are designated by the like numerals. When the data is to be written into the register 314, the selector 512C is controlled such that the signal on the signal line 414 or 417 is applied to the read addresses RA1 and RA2 of the channel memory device 512A. When the data from the incoming highway 401 is to be written into the channel memory device 512A, the selector 512B selects the incoming highway data 405 and the data 406 stored at the corresponding address of the channel memory device 512A by the output signal 407 of the write control circuit 313. In this manner, the block 512 including the channel memory device 512A and the selectors 512B and 512C attains the equivalent function to that of the channel memory 312 of Fig. 9. As is apparent from the description of the embodiment, the final stage time switch of the present invention can handle the signals of a multiple of bearer rate of merely expanding the bit width of the memory and adding the bit by bit selective writing function of the channel memory to the prior art time switch. Accordingly, the time division switch is significantly economized. Further, since the traffic quantity to be handled deponds only on the total of traffics of the bearer rate signals and does not depend on the traffic ratio of the bearer rate signals, a high flexibility to the traffic variation among the bearer rate signals is attained.
