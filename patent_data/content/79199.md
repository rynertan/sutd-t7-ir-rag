# Telecommunications cable and method of making same.

## Abstract
A telecommunication cable C, and method of making same, is disclosed comprised of more than five S Z twisted wire pairs 10 having their twist reversals 20 longitudinally staggered in a repetitive sequence of 1 to N longitudinally spaced positions. The wire pairs are bundled with any adjacent pairs having their twist reversals non overlapped and staggered by no more than N 2 positions which limits S to Z coupling.
