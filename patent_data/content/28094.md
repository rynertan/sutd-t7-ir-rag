# Long vertical shaft bioreactor and method of protecting it against extreme surges of influent waste water.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is provided whereby a pressuriz ed long vertical shaft bioreactor 1, 2 is protected against ex treme surges of influent waste liquid. The method provides for the transfer of excess waste from the top of the bioreactor head tank 3 to an adjacent collection vessel 31 where, in re sponse to the pressure created in the bioreactor, the collected waste is caused to overflow and is returned 35 to the influent waste stream. The method permits the return of waste from the reactor to the influent stream while bypassing the normal circulation route through the reactor.
