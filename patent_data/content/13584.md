# Temperature controller.

## Abstract
A device for maintaining the temperature of a body at a desired value comprises a thermo electric heat pump 2 sandwiched between a thermally conductive member 1 and heat sink 3 . The heat sink 3 is maintained at a substantially constant temperature, which is above the ambient tempera ture, by an electrical heating element 4 . This reduces the effect of changes in ambient temperature and enables the heat pump 2 to work across a substantially constant temper ature differential. The device may be used to control the temperature of a cuvette holding a sample for analysis in a spectrophotometer in which case a radiation transparent path is provided through the device.
