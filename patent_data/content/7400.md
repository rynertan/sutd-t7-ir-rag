# Anthracene derivatives useful as intermediates in the preparation of daunomycinones.

## Abstract
There is provided a novel method of synthesizing certain 3 2 ,5 dialkoxy 4 substituted phenyl phthalides wherein the 4 substituent has para directing properties. These com pounds provide a novel and regiospecific synthesis of a 9 acetyl 6, 11 dihydroxy 4 methoxy 7,8,9,10 tetrahydronaphthacene 5, 12 quinone 7,9 dideoxydaunomycinone in particular, which is a known intermediate in the synthesis of daunomycinone. There is also provided a method of preparing analogs of 7,9 dideoxydaunomycinone. Daunomycinone is a known com pound which is an intermediate in the preparation of the clinically accepted naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics daunomycin and its derivative adriamycin.
