# Immunofluorescent test method and substance for use therein.

## Abstract
Chlamydia trachomatis organisms are responsibe for a number of human ocular genital diseases. In order to test for infection by such organisms, reticulated body derived from any immunotype strain of C. trachomatis is utilized in a micro immunofluorescence testing, which allows the detec tion of antibody to C. trachomatis regardless of strain or immunotype. If anti human IgM is utilized in the fluorescent conjugate it can be determined if the antibody is derived from a human source of active infection.

## Description
IFEUNOFLUORESCENT TEST METHOD AND SUBSTANCE FOR USE THEREIN This invention relates to irnmunofluorescence test methods and to a substance for use therein. Chlamydia trachomatis organisms are the etiological agents for a number of human ocular genital diseases, such as ocular trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum LGV and non gonococcal urethritis NGU . The most important of these diseases in the United States isNGU. The annual incidence of NGU exceeds that of gonDrrhea and it is estimated that there occur more than 2,000,000 cases of NGU yearly in the United States alone.The most sensitive and specific serology of Chlamydia trachomatis has been the indirect micro immunofluorescence antibody test micro IF of Wang and Grayston J. Infect. Dis 130 388 1974 , currently used in several major chlamydial research laboratories throughout the world. However, due to the difficulty of the test, it has not yet been incorporated as a diagnostic procedure in general clinical laboratories. The standard micro IF test requires inclusion of 15 C. trachomatis immunotype elementary body EB antigens. Others have used a single immunotype strain with broad cross reactivity in the micro IF Thomas et al J. Clin.Microbiol. 4 6 1976 . This latter approach has practical value because in many instances information of specific immunotypes is not required for diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial infections. Unfortunately, no C. trachomatis strain cross reacts a hundred per cent with all 15 C. trachomatis immunotypes. Therefore, the usage of a single antigen has compromised the simplicity of the test in return for reduction in sensitivity.A different approach to this problem was taken byCaldwell et al, U. S. Patent No. 4,118,469 who isolated a single antigen common to all strains of C. trachomatis.This is used in the radioimmunoassay method.In the micro IF test, the use of a group specific antigen would make use ofan antibody s ability to crossraact with a broadly reacting antigen. Technically, the micro IF requires the intact morphology or structure of the organism for identification of the immunofluorescent reaction. Therefore, any procedure which alters or destroys the morphology of chlamydia cannot be used. However, if an intact form of the organism could be used which would be capable of providing broad cross reactivity to antisera of all the immunotypes, this antigenic form should provide the sensitivity needed from a single test antigen. Christophersen and Manire 3. Immunol. 103, 1085 1969 , working with C. Psittaci observed that the two developmental forms of chlamydiae, i.e., reticulated bodies RBs and elemental bodies EBs have distinct characteristics.RB is non infectious and does not contain the characteristic chlamydial toxins , EB is infectious and contains the toxins . Wang observed an exact correlation of the specificity of the mouse toxicity prevention test Wang, et al. 1963. Classification of trachoma virus strains by protection of mice from toxic death.J. Immunol. 90 849 856. and the micro IF Wang, et al. 1971. A micro immunofluorescence method.Study of antibody response to TRIC organisms in mice, p. 273 288. In R.L. Nichols 3d. , Trachoma and related disorders caused by chlamydial agents. ExcerptaMedica, Amsterdam. . This observation indicated that the type specific antigens might be the same as the toxins in the more mature EB form.It has been found that RB used as antigen in the microIF test cross reacted with all C. trachomatis immunotypes and psittacosis, indicating species as well as group reactivity. The test using the RB antigen was as sensitive as the test using multiple EB antigens inC. trachomatis sro1ogy, resulting in a further simplification of the micro IF test. Positive sera can be tested for type specificity by the standard mero fF test later, if needed. Furthermore, the larger size of the RB makes for easier reading In the fluorescent antibody microscope. In addition, the antigen can be stored at 4 C for at least 1 year, making the RB antigen extremely useful in the serological screening of sera for chlamydial antibodies even in laboratories not specialized in chlamydia research. By utilizing IgM or IgG antihuman antibodies the test is further refined since IgM antibodies will only react in the case of inactive infection while IgG antibody will react when any antibody to the RB anti gen was present in the serum.The C. trachomatis strains utilized in the preparation of the reticulated body which is the subject of the present invention are grown in a tissue culture suit ably in HeLa 229 monolayers in accordance with the method of Kuo, et al Growth of trachoma organisms in HeLa 229 cell culture, p. 328 336. In D. Hobson and K.K. Holmes ed. , Nongonococcal urethritis and related infections. ASM Publications, WashingtonDC. In this method, one day old HeLa cell monolayers are inoculated with about 10 inclusion forming units cell of organism to insure 100 infectivity of the cells. The infected cells are harvested in the early stages of growth to assure a substantial predominance of RB over the EB form. Such harvesting should suit ably be done between 24 and 28 hours post infection. The cells are then disrupted for a very brief period suitably about 30 seconds by sonication and subjected to one cycle of differential centrifugation. The thus obtained pellet is then layered on a suitable high density medium suitably renograf in preferably 35 renographin and centrifuged. This centrifugation serves to retain law molecular weight components. The re slant pellet containing the desired high molecular weight component is resuspended in a suitable buffer and layered on linear gradient renografin and recentrifuged. The major band appearing in the middle of the 35 through 60 gradient is collected diluted with saline, recentrifuged and in the preferred embodiment of this invention, stabilized.Such stabilization may be carried out by treatment with formaldehyde suitably formalin or with gluteraldehyde both in saline solution. The thus stabilized RB bodies may be stored for a substantial period of time at reduced temperatures suitably at about 4 C.The micro IF test utilizing the RB is substantially that disclosed by Wang Wang, et alt 1963. Classification of trachoma virus strains by protectlon of mice from toxic death. J. Immunol. 90 849 856. as improved by Wang and Grayston J. Infect. Dis. 130 388 at 389. . In this test there is prepared a substrate, suitably a clean microscope slide. A guidance template indicating test loci is placed under the slide and samples of the antigen that is to say the RB samples are placed on the slide by suitable means for example a pen point on those areas indicated by the template. The slides are then air dried and the antigen affixed upon the substrate suitably by immersion in acetone for ten to fifteen minutes at ambient temperatures.The sample material suspected of containing antibodies to C. trachomatis is then subjected to serial dilution in the usual manner. These sources may be animal sera suitably mouse or rabbit sera or, in the expected application of this test, may be human sources suitably human sera, tears or endocervical secretions. The test samples are placed upon the antigen dots with a bacteriologic loop. The slides are incubated in a moist environment suitably at about 37 C for about 30 minutes and the slides washed gently preferably with phosphate buffered saline to remove the unreacted suspected antibody source material.The substrate is then treated with anti source materials species antibodies coupled with the fluorescent materials thus where the antibody source material is the mouse then there can be used for example, goat anti mouse gammaglobulin conjugated with, for example, fluorescein isothiocyanate. Where the source material is human there may be utilized similarly coupled goat antihuman gammaglobulin. It will be clear to those skilled in the art what type of anti species antibodies should be utilized.In a particularly preferred modification of the invention, where the antibody source material is human, there is utilized a fluorescent conjugate of antihuman IgM antibody and anti human IgG antibody. SinceIgM is only present in an active infection this mode of proceeding provides a method of determining whether the antibody source material comes from an active or a passive infection.The conjugate solution is applied to the slides with a bacteriologic loop in the manner described above and the substrate incubated,rinsed, washed and airdried. The slides are then examined under a source of UV light. The presence of fluorescence indicating the presence of antibody to C. trachomatis in the test samples.

One day old HeLa cell monolayers in 32 oz. prescription bottles were inoculated with about 10 inclusion forming units cell or organisms to assure 100 infectivity of the cells.Infected cells were harvested 28 h post infect Ion. Cells were disrupted by sonication for 30 s with a medium probe at 60 intensity BiosonikIII, Bronwill Scientific, Rochester, NY . After one cycle of differential centrifugation 500 xg 10 min and 30,000 xg 30 min , the pellet was layered on 35 renografin methylglucamine diatrizoate, 76 for infection, Squibb and Sons, NY and centrifuged at 22,000 xg for 1 h in a Spinco Model L ultracentrifuge using a horizontal rotor SW 25.1 Beckman Instruments Inc.,Palo Alto, CA . The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer and layered on a 35 60 renografin linear gradient and centrifuged at 42,000 xg for 1.5 h. One major band appeared in the middle of the gradient.This band consisted predominantly of RB. The RB band was collected with a capillary pipette, and diluted with 10 mM TES saline, pH 7.0, and pelleted at 30,000 xg for 30 min. RBs were fixed immediately by resuspending with 68 formalin in 10 mM TES saline, centrifuged, resuspended in 0.02 formalin in l0mM TES saline, and stored in a 4 C refrigerator for use. Eighteen culture bottles were usually inoculated per preparation and the final product resuspended in 1 ml of 0.02 formalin. In the above procedure glutaxaldehyde may be used in place of formaldehyde.C. trachomatis sroloy. The serology was performed using the micro IF test as described by Wang J. Infect. Dis. 130 388 1974 . RB antigens were placed on the microscope slide along with the EB antigens of the particular immunotypes which were to be compared. Two fold serial serum dilutions were used. Tears and endocervical secretions were tested in the same way as serum. The dilution factors of the eluate were 1 10 for tear and 1 15 for endocervical secretions. Fluorescein conjugated goat anti human immunoglobulins IgMAG combined igg chain specfic , and IgG y chain specific , were obtained trom Hyland Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA. The highest serum dilution which gave a definite fluorescence was taken as endpoint. Titers of 32 or greater with mouse serum and 8 or greater with human serum were regarded as positive. Duplicate slides were run each time.Results which agreed in the duplicate slides were recorded. Where duplicate slides did not agree, the slide showing the higher titer for EB was recorded as the result for the test.Sensitivity and specificity of RB in testing mouse antisera.The RBs of types C 3 OT, B TW 5 OT, and L 434 Bu were used as test antigens against mouse antisera of 15 C. trachomatis immunotypes.

ASM Publications, Washington,D.C. as well as two groups of biologically distinct organisms, i.e., trachoma and LGV.C TW 3 OT RB reacted with the same sensitivity to C complex antisera, except for types I and K antisera which were 2 to 3 two fold dilutions less sensitive than the EB However, tne C TR 3 OT RB reaction to the B complex sera was one to three two fold dilutions less sensitive than theEB, except for L which exhibited comparable sensitivity.L2 434 Bu RB in general showed comparable sensitivity to the B complex bt was from on to four two fold dilutions less sensitive to the C complex, with the exception of L3 which had the same sensitivity. B TW DtOT was one two fold dilutions less sensitive than the homotypic EB, but was 4 two fold dilutions less sensitive in detectIng type C antibody. It was no tested further with other immunotypes for this reason.C TW 3 OT was also tested against MoPn and Mn antisera.The results were not conclusive du to low antiserum titers. Since C TW 3 OT PuB gave better results in cross reacting with all mmunotypes than the two other RB preparations it was used for the remaining studies. C TW 3 OT RB harvested at 28 h was contaminated with a trace amount of EB. The transition of RB to EB in the developmental cycle is a continuous process not only in size but also in density. These two populations could not be separated by density gradient centrifugation. However, contamination with trace EB did not interfere with micro IF serology.Use of a single RB antigen C TW 3 OT in the microIF is a useful, practical, simple, and sensitive serological test for C. trachomatis.

All five had antibodies toEB which consisted of immunotypes, one each of A,CJ, GF and two B.Reaction of RB to psittacosis patients sera.Twelve sera from former psittacosis patients were tested against C TW 3 OT RB three were negative, four equivocal and five positive. Under micro IF the four equivocal results appeared as untypical RB with the rings appearing as slightly undulating circles, resulting in a patchy appearance rather than sharp, clear, round cocci. The titers of the five positive cases were 8, 16, 64, 64 and 64. Positive reaction to RB did not correlate with psittacosis complement fixation titers. Detection of antibodies in tears and endocervical secretions with RB.Thirty five tear specimens and 17 endocervical secretions were tested against C TW 3 OT RB as well as against multiple EB antigens in routine micro IF serology.Three 2 fold dilutions were used 1 10, 1 20 and 1 40 for tears and three 4 fold dilutions 1 15, 1 60 and 1 240 for endocervical secretions. EBs were found to detect antibodies in tears better than C TW 3 OT RB Table 3 668 positive for EB and 60 positive for RB. Fifteen of twenty three 65 positive tear specimens were type C, one type GF and the rest type 3. Nine tear specimens had higher titers to EB than to RB two with two tube difference and 7 with onetube difference. Two specimens were EB positive andRB negative. The remaining 12 had equal titers toEB and RB.However, with endocervical secretions RB showed more positive reactions than ED, 59 vs. 53 respectively.Most of the titers were the same for RB and EB. Only one case showed a 1 tube higher titer for the EB with the RB negative. Three cases showed a 1 tube higher titer for RB with EB negative in one of these 3 cases.The immunotypes found were four ED and six GF. The overall relative sensitivity of RB to EB for both tears and endocervical secretions was 97 .
