# Animal foodstuff.

## Abstract
Animal food is provided in the form of cushion shaped hollow units 1 each with a crisper shell 5 of a first formulation of cereal and proteinaceous material sealed at 2 and 3 to define a completely closed space 6 , partly filled with a second formula tion 9 , usually predominantly at one end 7 , of softer material, usually a liquid, gel or gum. This gives a clean crisp product, uniform to handle but attractive by consistency, taste and smell to animals. The product can readily be modified without losing these characteristics since the central component is totally enclosed by a stable crisp shell.

## Description
ANINAL FOODSTUFF. This invention relates to foodstuffs for animals, and particularly but not exclusively to dog food. Dog food is available as moist, semi moist or dry dog food. The first category is usually not invariably canned. Dry dog food, however, is cheaper to make and store, and is usually sold in packets or sacks as hard biscuit like lumps. These hard lumps, although compounded from milled cereals and proteinaceous meal to be a complete food, have certain disadvantages. Thus, they are not always suitable for small dogs, or older dogs with deteriorating teeth, since they require some force to break them into suitable fragments for swallowing.Also, they can lack palatability for dogs, since there is some restriction on the components which can be introduced. It is therefore commonplace to use the relatively cheap dry dog food as an extended or supplement to a more expensive moist dog food, especiaily for larger breeds of dog. To improve the attraction of dry dog food it has been proposed to form Snnfsgpieces of such food, of say 2 3 cm diameter, with a central core of different foodstuff. However, the nature of such central core is limited since it must be substantially solid and not unacceptable in smell, or appearance or handling to the dog owner. In particular, it should not be liquid or sticky in consistency, nor should it cause the cereal component to become microbiologically unstable by moisture migration. Often, modification to the cereal outer component is necessary to offset the effects of such moisture migration. The present invention is based on the realisation that a dry dog food of improved breakability, which is attractive to dogs by smell, taste and texture, can be made as a clean, low density product which can be stored and handled without unpleasant odour to humans. In one aspect the invention provides an animal food consisting of units comprising a hard closed external shell of a first animal food formulation including a cereal component and a combined or separate proteinaceous component, defining an internal space at least partly occupied by a second animal food formulation of a different degree of subdivision or consistency.For example, the second formulation may be a powder although it is usually a softer, or even liquid material.Although the invention is preferably formulated as a dog food, it can also be used for cat foods, or in foods or food supplements for farm animals, in menagerie feeding stuffs, or in foodstuffs, especially of controlled composition, for animals in research establishments. The hard closed external shell can be of any shape. However, as described below in more detail, it is convenient to make the shells by a process involving extrusion of a moist tube of the first formulation and then crimping and cutting this tube at intervals. Thus, the shell is preferably of a generally square or rectangular appearance, and may be somewhat pillowshaped or cushion shaped with two parallel sealed edges which have visible crimping. A generally square shell of 2 to 3 cms edge length will be found convenient. The proportions of the shell can vary in dependence on its basic shape and formulation. For a cushionshaped, generally square, shell the maximum overall thickness can be for example from 1 4 to 2 3 its edge length, but is usually about half. The wall thickness can be such that the maximum separation between internal opposed faces of such a square shell is e.g. from one to four times the wall thickness, usually from one to two times. In absolute terms, the thickness can for example be from 3 to 8 mm, usually about 5 mm. The first animal food formulation can vary widely in proportion as between the components. Indeed, it is an advantage of the present invention that if market cost or availability of the usual components of the first formulation should alter, the total mix of food can still retain its food values by suitable alteration of the amount or nature of the second formulation. Because of the sealed nature of the product, this does not alter the smell, appearance of handling qualities of the foodstuff, at least not to the human senses. However, usually the weight proportions as between the cereal and proteinaceous components will vary between 30 70 e.g. 50 50 and 90 10 e.g. 80 20 . The cereal component usually predominates, and is often a wheat flour, though flour from other cereals oats, maize, rye, etc could be used.Additionally or alternatively the proteinaceous component can comprise animal protein and or vegetable protein, e.g. meat meal, fish meal, meat andbone meal, etc., from a wide variety of sources, usually in predominant admixture with a vegetable protein meal such as soya flour. The hard shell defines an internal space which can be wholly filled with second formulation but is more usually only partly filled, since this appears to help ease of breakage by the animal and also improves the bulk volume of the product so that, volume by volume, it need be no more expensive than prior art products made by simpler methods. Thus, the extent to which the internal space is filled may vary from, say, one or two percent to ninety percent. Usually, it is from 5 to 50 e.g.10 to 30 filled. The second food formulation can be a powder more usually, however, it can range from a liquid through a sticky or gelled formulation via a cheesy or chewy consistency to a stiff gummy layer, provided it is generally softer than the first formulation. It can be a uniform internal coating, but more usually, as a consequence of the preferred method of production described below, it forms an accumulation towards one end of the internal space. The composition of this second food formulation can similarly vary over a wide range. It can include sugars, e.g. corn syrups, glucose or sucrose, as a syrup or gum component. It can also include glycerine. It will often include meat meals, or meat extracts or yeast extracts, or possibly fish products. Cheese and like dairy products or by products can also be present. Vegetable extracts or powders can be included. Flavourings, odorants, colourings, vitamins and similar minor components are often included. Generally speaking it is preferred to use material which an animal can detect by smell even through the envelope but which to a human is undetectable or at least not unpleasant. However, the total enclosure by the envelope means that a variety of materials and changes of material can be used with consistent results. In another aspect the invention provides a method for the production of an animal food as described above, which includes the steps of making up a first animal food formulation including a cereal component, a proteinaceous component and enough water to give an extrudable consistency making up a second animal food formulation of an extrudable or injectable consistency extruding the first formulation as a tube and simultaneously extruding or injecting the second formulation so as to be located within the tube passing the tube and contents progressively into sealing and severing means whereby a plurality of moist external shells of the first formulation, enclosing a portion of the second formulation, are severed from the tube and drying the shells so that the external shell becomes a hard shell enclosing a softer food formulation. In the method of the invention it is preferred for the water content of the filling to be lower than that of the casing. This means that as the filled shell is dried, the filling does not yield water to the shell, so that the shell remains crisp and is not subject to moult growth which would otherwise be the case i.e. with water contents over 15 by weight unless expensive humectants are incorporated. Other preferred features of the method will be apparent from the above discussion. It is convenient for the tube to be extruded vertically downwards, into sealing and severing means constituted by opposed pairs of blades protruding from two parallel rollers, and preferably having corrugated edges to crimp the sealing line. In such a case the tube extrusion speed will generally match the roller peripheral speed. The second formulation can be injected or extruded vertically downwards inside the tube, e.g. as a liquid to accumulate at the base of the tube immediately before sealing and severing. Alternatively, the second component could be injected or extruded at an angle to contact and adhere to the internal surface of the tube. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings and Example, in which Figure 1 is a general view of a unit of animal food according to the invention Figure 2 is a section along II II of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a diagram showing how such units of food may be produced. The unit piece 1 of animal food is generally square, with two parallel straight sealed edges 2 and 3, crimped at 4. It is formed by sealing and severing a tube see below and thus adopts a cushion shape, as shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 2, each unit consists of a hard outer closed shell 5 of a first food formulation defining an internal space 6, in this case partly filled at 7 and 8 with a suitable softer second food formulation 9. This product can be made by extruding a moist mix 10 of the first food formulation by a screw extruder through a circular die orifice at 11 to form a tube 12.Simultaneously, a mix 13 of the second formulation is extruded into the interior of the tube 12 where it passes to location 14. This is defined by the sealing line 15 induced by the action of opposed blades 16, mounted on co rotating rollers 17. As these rotate, blades 18 seal and sever at a different location in relation to the tube, which is extruded at the blade peripheral speed. Thus a succession of units 19 accumulate at 20 on conveyor 21 by which they pass through over 22 to accumulate at 23 as product. A specific Example of the invention was carried out as follows. A first food formulation was prepared from a mixture of maize flour 43.5 parts by weight , wheat flour 28.5 parts by weight greaves meal 19.5 p.b.w. and soya flour with the addition of suitable dyestuffs, vitamins, minerals, 5 p.b.w. vegetable flavourings and salts total 3.5 p.b.w. . Greaves are the residular parts of waste meat from which the fat has been rendered. 70 parts of this mixture were mixed with 30 parts of water. This was mixed, and extruded under an increased pressure, a temperature above 1COOC and high shear conditions through circular die 11. Some of the water evaporated off, and the material expanded at the die lip, due to release of pressure, thus giving it a slightly porous consistency and a water content of about 23 . A second food formulation was simultaneously injected to accumulate at 14. It consisted of 50 by weight of glucose syrup, 80 solid content and 63 dextrose equivalent 24 by weight sucrose 10 by weight tallow 10 by weight preatinised starch 5 by weight glycerine, and trace amounts, ca.1 of colouring and potassium sorbate. Various modifications in which 2 to 10 by weight of this second formulation were replaced by protein meal, cheese powder, vegetable powders, meat or yeast extracts, vitamins, etc, alone or in combination were also tried. In each case 75 by weight of first formulation and 25 of second were used. The crimping, sealing and severing took place under sufficient pressure to cause the first formulation to adhere to itself and seal. The separate units were dried and cooked to a total 10 moisture content at oven 22, leaving an internal chewy material, predominantly at one end 7 of the space 6 as shown in Figure 2. The dog food obtained rated 98 in pal at ability tests, i.e. 98 of dogs preferred it to a lump foodstuff of only the first formulation. It appears likely that dogs can scent the filling, although there is no pronounced different smell to a human nose. Moreover, the units were appreciably easier to break into suitable fragments, and in bulk occupied the same volume per unit cost as the known lump material. The product is of a different nature from known products. Thus, while it is known for example to seal foodstuffs in a pastry for human consumption, they are not dried and cooked to expliciky seal in the contents and cause voids to appear moreover, the products do not comprise proteinaceous meal in the casing, giving its own characteristics for sealing and porosity of the shell. Also, the use of liquid into low water content fillings, whereby water is abstracted from the less hygroscopic surrounding shell to give a more permanently crisp material has not hitherto been suggested.
