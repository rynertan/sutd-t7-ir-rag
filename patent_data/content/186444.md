# Highly efficient coding apparatus for digital video signal.

## Abstract
Coding apparatus for coding digital video data in the form of a block data to a compressed video data, comprises first detecting means for detecting a maximum value of the digital video data of plural picture elements in said block, second detecting means for detecting a minimum value of the digital video data of plural picture elements in said block, means for generating a dynamic range information of the block from said maximum and minimum values, means for subtracting said minimum value from each of the digital data to generate modified digital video data, means for encoding said modified digital video data with the fixed digitized bit number less than that of original digital video data, and transmitting means for transmitting the output of said encoding means and an additional code per one block formed of at least two of said maximum value, minimum value, and a signal according to said dynamic range information.
