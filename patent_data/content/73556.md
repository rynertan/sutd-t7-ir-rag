## Abstract
A platinum catalyst which comprises the admixture of a a haloplatinum compound b an aliphatically unsaturated organosiloxane com pound and c an aluminium alkoxide. These catalysts give high activity in promoting reac tions of Si H compounds with unsaturated groups or Si OH. They are valuable in producing cured organopolysiloxanes such as release coatings. They are characterised by storage stability and free dom from corrosion of metallic containers.
