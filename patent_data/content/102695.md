# Improved dentifrice preparations comprising calcined kaolin abrasives.

## Abstract
Incorporation of talc in dentifrice preparations based on calcined kaolins enhances the rheological properties of such dentifrices. In addition, new and more effective dentifrice preparations may be obtained by employing therein a cleaning and polishing constituent comprising a mixture of calcined kaolin, talc and titanium dioxide. Additionally, anticariogenic adjuvants, such as sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride, especially a 1 2 molar mixture thereof, may be incorporated in such dentifrice preparations.
