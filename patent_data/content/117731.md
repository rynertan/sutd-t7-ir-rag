## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF METHYL OR ETHYL MONO CHLORIDE OR BROMIDE The present invention relates to a process for the production of methyl or ethyl mono chloride or bromide. Methyl mono halides, being functional derivatives of methane, are potentially important intermediates in the production, for example of methanol. Converting methane to methyl mono halides and thence to methanol offers an alternative to converting it first to synthesis gas carbon monoxide hydrogen and thereafter to methanol. Similarly, ethyl mono halides, being functional derivatives of ethane, are potentially important intermediates in the production, for example of ethanol. Converting ethane to ethyl mono halides and thence to ethanol offers an alternative to converting it first to ethylene and thereafter to ethanol. It is known to produce such alkyl mono halides by reacting methane or ethane with a halogen, but this is conventionally carried out at elevated temperatures at which the selectivity to the desired alkyl mono halides is low, there being generally formed in addition to the alkyl mono halide a variety of halogenated alkane derivatives. Thus in the case of chlorine as the halogen for example the reaction is usually carried out at temperatures above 450go at which temperatures in addition to methyl chloride substantial amounts of methylene dichloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride are also obtained. It is also well known to produce chlorine from hydrogen chloride by oxidation with air or oxygen at temperatures in the region of 400us or above using a suitable catalyst, such as cupric chloride, either supported on an inert support or in the form of a melt together with a melting point depressant, such as potassium chloride. This process is generally referred to as the Deaccn process. Although the Deacon process has been largely overtaken by electrolytic processes for the production of chlorine, it is till utilised with simultaneous chlorination of organics in the production, for example, of 1,2 dichloroethane by oxychlorination of ethylene. It has now been found unexpectedly that methyl or ethyl mono chloride or bromide can be obtained in high selectivities by oxyhalogenating methane or ethane at temperatures below 450at. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the selective production of methyl or ethyl mono chloride or bromide which process comprises feeding methane or ethane and hydrogen chloride or bromide and a source of molecular oxygen to an oxychlorination zone maintained at a temperature below 450us and containing a supported oxychlorination catalyst. By the term selective production as used throughout this specification is meant, in the case of the production of the monohalide from methane that 80 or more of the converted methane is in the form of the monohalide and, in the case of the production of the monohalide from ethane that 60X or more of the converted ethane is in the form of the monohalide. Generally, in the case of methane, the remaining 20 or less of the converted methane is in the form of rmltihalogenated methane. However, in the case of ethane the remaining 40 or less of the converted ethane may comprise products other than rmltihalogenated ethanes. Both methane and ethane are abundantly available in natural gas reservoirs. Methane may also be obtained by the biological conversion of organic materials and by the methanation or in situ gasification of coal. Hydrogen chloride is available in vast amounts as a by product from other integrated chlorination processes, such as for example the production of chlorinated solvents and synthetic resins. Although not available on such an extensive scale, hydrogen bromide is nevertheless readily obtainable on a commercial scale. A preferred source of molecular oxygen is air, though gases richer or poorer in oxygen than air, for example molecular oxygen, may be employed. Suitable oxychlorination catalysts include those comprising compounds of one or more multivalent metals. Suitable multivalent metals include copper, nickel, iron and palladium and suitable compounds include the halide salts of the metal. Other metallic salts or compounds may also be incorporated in the catalyst if desired. Suitable metallic salts include alkali metal halides. Preferably the metallic compounds are deposited on a support.Suitable supports include silica, alumina, silica alumina, natural and synthetic zeolites, clays, pillared clays and the like. The metal may be deposited on the support by any suitable technique such as impregnation, precipitation, co precipitation etc. The metals may be present on the support in any suitable amount, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20 w w more preferably from 0.5 to 5 w w. The proportions of methane or ethane, hydrogen chloride or bromide and molecular oxygen containing gas in the feed may be varied over a wide range. Suitably, the molar ratio of methane or ethane to hydrogen chloride or bromide may be in the range from 0.5 to 10, preferably from 1 to 4. The molar ratio of methane or ethane to molecular oxygen containing gas may suitably be in the range from 0.1 to 5, preferably from 0.5 to 2. The oxychlorination zone is maintained at a temperature below 450us, preferably below 375UC, even more preferably at or below 350us, and suitably as low as 250us. Preferably the zone is maintained at a temperature in the range from 300 to 350UC. The specific temperatures selected within the aforesaid ranges will depend to some extent on the nature of the particular oxychlorination catalyst which is to be employed, for example using iron based catalysts temperatures in the upper parts of the aforesaid ranges may be employed. Thus, using iron based catalyse temperatures up to 450UC may be used. However, using other catalysts, for example copper based catalysts, lower temperatures within the aforesaid ranges are desirable. The products of the process may be recovered and separated by methods known in the art. It is preferred to produce methyl or ethyl chloride by feeding methane or ethane, hydrogen chloride and air to the oxychlorination zone. The process may be operated batchwise or continuously, preferably continuously. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Examples.Example 1 A mixture of methane, hydrogen chloride and oxygen mole ratio 4 2 1 was passed over copper chloride impregnated alumina 2.9Z wtCu in a continuous flow reactor contact time 13 sec which was heated by means of an electric furnace. The heated zone of the catalyst bed was at 325UC. The product stream was analysed by gas chromatography. The composition of the product stream, excluding unreacted reactants, was methyl chloride 88 v v and methylene chloride 12Z v v and the methane conversion was 19 . Example 2 A mixture of methane, hydrogen chloride and air volume ratio 4 2 5 was passed over ferric chloride impregnated celite 0.8 wtFe in a continuous flow reactor contact time 46 sec . The reactor was heated by means of an electric furnace and the heated zone of the catalyst bed was at 350us. The product stream was analysed by gas chromatography. The product stream, excluding unreacted feed gases, was methyl chloride greater than 99 and the methane conversion was 23 .Comparative Test 1 The experiment described in Example 2 above was repeated under similar conditions. The heated zone of the catalyst bed was maintained at 500us. The composition of the gaseous product stream, excluding unreacted reactants, was methyl chloride 63 v v and methylene chloride 37 v v with a methane conversion of 32 .Comparative Test 2 Comparative Test 1 was repeated under similar conditions with copper chloride impregnated celite. The heated zone of the catalyst bed was maintained at 4500C. The composition of the gaseous product stream, excluding unreacted reactants, was methyl chloride 58 v v , methylene chloride 40 v v and chloroform 2t v v and the methane conversion was 27 . These comparative tests are presented to demonstrate that at elevated temperatures 450 C and above conversions are obtained with low selectivity to methyl chloride and increased selectivity to uiltichlorinated methanes. These are not examples according to the invention and they are only included for the purpose of comparison.

The composition of the product stream, excluding unreacted feed gases, was ethyl chloride 67 v v , vinyl chloride 15 v v and 1,2 dichloroethane 18 v v with an ethane conversion of 13 .
