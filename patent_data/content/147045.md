# MEMBRANE TYPE CIRCUIT HAVING IMPROVED TAIL

## Abstract
Membrane type circuit comprises an insulating support 8 having terminal sites 36, 38 thereon and circuit conduc tors 1 4, 1 4 extending between and among the terminal sites. A tail 12 extends from the support and the conductors extend onto the tail and have output terminals 1 27, 4 27, 1 27, 4 27 on the tail. The tail 12 is folded so that the output terminals on each side of the fold line 20 are against each other and are connected to each other. Each pair of conductors which extends from two opposed output termin als are therefore a dual conductor. This arrangement simpli fies circuit design and avoids the need for crossovers in many circumstances.
