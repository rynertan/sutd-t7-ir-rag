# A gymnastic bicycle.

## Abstract
A gymnastic bicycle, which consists of a mechanism that transmits vibrations to the body of the person doing pedalling exercises. The bicycle in addition includes a device to control physical strain when the bicycle is used to simulate physical rowing exercises. The mechanism transmitting the vibrations consists of a lever 2 , one end of which rests on the articulated section of the tube 6 that forms the bicycle handlebars 7 . There is a roller 8 at the other end of this lever 2 which optionally may enter into contact with the periphery of a polygonal unit 11 that turns when the pedals are moved. Such polygonal unit forms part of or is joined to the inertia wheel 9 that controls the pedal movement.
