## Description
THERMALLY STABLE CRYSTAL POLYMERS OF STYRENIC MONOMERS This invention relates to thermally stable crystal polymers of styrenic monomers, such as crystal polystyrene, which are polymerized in the presence of a hindered phenolic antioxidant. This invention provides a method for preparing a thermally stabilized crystal polymer of a styrenic monomer, the method comprising the steps of i mixing a stabilizing amount of hindered phenolic antioxidant with the styrenic monomer and ii polymerizing the styrenic monomer of step i . Thermally stable polystyrene is particularly advantageous in such applications as foam extrusion and injection molding. The economic factors affecting these applications dictate the need to recycle scrap and trim. Recycling is typically harsh on polystyrene s physical properties. The polymer is subjected to several heat and mechanical histories during each cycle which degrade it and lower the value of the material as a plastic. Recycled material is mixed with new resin in proportions necessary to form an acceptable article, i.e., new resin is used to upgrade the recycled resin to minimal standards. Therefore, the longer a material can be recycled, the smaller amount of new material is needed. Furthermore, the more stable to degradation a material is, the longer it can be recycled. U.S. Patent No. 4,136,142 describes a stabilized crystal polystyrene composition having a hindered phenol and a tris substituted phenyl phosphite. However, the hindered phenol and phosphite are compounded into prepolymerized polystyrene by an extruder operating at temperatures of at least 2040C 4000F . This compounding step is not only costly, particularly in terms of energy consumed, but it may also have a degradative effect on the polystyrene. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods of stabilizing crystal polystyrene. The term styrenic monomers as used herein is intended to connote aryl vinyl monomers such as styrene, ring substituted alkyl styrenes and ring halo substituted styrenes. Particular styrenic monomers include styrene, paramethylstyrene, metamethylstyrene, para t butylstyrene and parachlorostyrene, a preferred styrenic monomer being styrene. The expression crystal polymers of styrenic monomers as used herein is intended to connote homopolymers of styrenic monomers. The hindered phenolic antioxidant may comprise one or more compounds. Examples of such hindered phenolic antioxidant compounds include n octadecyl 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamate IRGANOX 1076, a tradename of Ciba Geigy neopentanetetrayl tetrakis 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamate 2,6 di tertbutyl para cresol butylated hydroxytoluene or BHT 1,3, 5 tris 4 tert butyl 3 hydroxy 2, 6 dimethylbenzyl 1,3, 5 triazine 1,1,3 tris 2 methyl 4 hydroxy 5 tert butylphenyl butane and 1,3, 5 trimethyl 2, 4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene. A preferred antioxidant is 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene.Certain hindered phenolic antioxidants are discussed in the Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Ehemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 3 1978 , pages 128 148. Note particularly, compounds 13 16 referred to on pages 129 133 of the above mentioned passage of Kirk Othmer. The amount of hindered phenolic antioxidant may be, e.g., 100 1000 ppm, preferably about 500 ppm, relative to the amount of styrenic monomer present. While not wishing to be limited to any particular theory or mechanism, the polymerization of styrenic monomer in the presence of hindered phenolic antioxidants is felt to significantly increase the recycleability of the resulting styrenic polymer by terminating degradative radicals during processing. The styrenic monomer of the above mentioned step i may also contain one or more other additives such as external lubricants, internal lubricants and an aryl phosphite additive. The term external lubricant as used herein is intended to connote a lubricant which tends to reduce friction on the external surface of the polymeric mass when contacted with various surfaces. For example, an external lubricant may reduce friction generated from the contact of the external surface of a polymeric mass with the internal, metal surface of a reactor. For this reason, external lubricants may sometimes also be termed metal lubricants. The term internal lubricant as used herein is intended to connote a lubricant which tends to reduce the friction generated in the interior of the polymeric mass when individual polymeric chains slide along one another.External lubricants may be particularly useful in foam grades of polymers, whereas internal lubricants may be particularly useful in injection molding grades of polymers. Examples of external lubricants include stearic acid, zinc stearate, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, ethytlene bisstearamide and polyethylene polypropylene oxides. A preferred external lubricant is zinc stearate. Examples of internal lubricants include various mineral oils, such as KAYDOL 350 a tradename of Witco , PRIMOL 350 a tradename of Exxon , and ARCO 400 a tradename of Arco . Examples of aryl phosphites are mentioned in U.S. PatentNo. 4,136,142. A preferred aryl phosphite additive is tris nonylphenyl phosphite. Zinc Stearate may be used in an amount of 250 2000 ppm relative to the amount of styrenic monomer, especially about 1000 ppm for a foam grade polymer. Tris nonylphenyl phosphite may be used in an amount of 500 1500 ppm relative to the amount of styrenic monomer, especially 500 ppm for a foam grade polymer. While still not wishing to be limited to any particular theory or mechanism, the inclusion of zinc stearate in the styrene is felt to increase. recycleability by reducing the effects of mechanical shear on the polymer during processing. The inclusion of aryl phosphites is felt to extend the ability of the hindered phenolic in terminating radicals. Furthermore, phosphites are felt to improve the aesthetic appearance of the recycle product by reducing the discoloration associated with the interaction of zinc and phenolic compounds. Traditionally, fabricators would use the highest molecular weight Mw crystal polystyrene available for their specific application in order to accomodate the anticipated physical property loss due to recycling. The high MW resin for foam is more expensive than general purpose grades since it must be produced at slower rates. The high Mw resin is also difficult to fabricate due to higher melt viscosities which increase power consumption. A major advantage of this invention is the ability of a stabilized, lower Mw resin to replace the more expensive and energy intensive high Mw resin. This offers an advantage to both the resin producer faster production rates and the fabricator lower energy consumption and increased recycled resin stability . For example, a foam grade crystal polystyrene stabilized in accordance with the present invention may have a melt index of 2.2 to 2.6. By contrast, a high molecular weight, unstabilized foam grade crystal polystyrene having similar recyclability properties might have a melt index of 1.8 or less. More particularly, a relatively low molecular weight foam grade crystal polystyrene produced in accordance with the present invention having a melt index of about 2.2 would compare favorably, in terms of recyclability, with a relatively high molecular weight unstabilized foam grade polystyrene having a melt index of 1.5. The stabilized styrenic polymer of the present invention may be produced by any suitable polymerization technique such as, e.g., thermally initiated techniques, free radical initiator initiated techniques, bulk polymerization techniques, solvent polymerization techniques and suspension polymerization techniques. Hindered phenolic antioxidants and other additives may be added to the polymerization system at the beginning or at subsequent stages of polymerization. It is particularly noted that the styrenic monomer of the above mentioned step i may contain other materials not specifically set forth herein, such as dissolved polystyrene. EXAMPLE 1 Styrene monomer was used to dissolve 500 ppm of 1,3,5trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene Ethyl 330 or A0 330, tradenames of Ethyl Corp. . The solution was polymerized thermally and pelletized for testing. A Brabender Plasticorder trademark torque rheometer was used to demonstrate the maintenance of melt viscosity during the recycle simulations.The results Table A show that the stabilized resin retained its polymeric properties longer than the unstabilized control sample.
