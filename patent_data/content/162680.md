# ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS

## Abstract
An electrical connector has a plurality of contacts secured in bores in an insulating material by supporting clips, also located in the bores. Each contact can be replaced when necessary without disturbing adjacent contacts by suitable deformation of its supporting clip. These supporting clips are usually fairly short and are retained in the bores between very small shoulders. They can thus sometimes be dislodged on insertion of a contact resulting in the contact and the clip being jammed inside the bore. In the present invention the supporting clip extends over the whole length of the contact and is located against the larger shoulders which locate the ends of the contact.
