# Molecular cloning of the gene for human anti haemophilic factor IX.

## Abstract
It has been a problem to find an alternative, less timecon suming, and more reliable source of factor IX, a polypeptide which is essential to the human blood clotting process and ne cessary for the treatment of patients with Christmas disease. The invention is an important step towards solving the problem by way of genetic engineering, in that it provides recombinant DNA containing a DNA sequence occurring in the human fac tor IX genome. It includes recombinant DNA comprising sub stantially the whole sequence of human factor IX genome in serted in a cloning vehicle and transformed into a host such as E.coli. It is conveniently characterised by a 129 or 203 nucleo tide long sequence J J and J J . Other frag ments of the sequence have also been cloned and the inven tion includes DNA molecules comprising part or all of the hu man factor IX DNA. The invention also includes cDNA derived from human factor IX RNA. Uses of the invention include the provision of an intermediate of value in the genetic engineering of a factor IX polypeptide precursor and thence manufacture of the factor IX polypeptide, and in making probes for use in diag nosing the presence of normal or abnormal factor IX DNA in patients with Christmas disease.
