# Multilayer thin film electrical devices free of adhesive.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a laminate comprising alternating polymer sheets and metal layers between the polymer sheets, the laminate being substantially free of adhesive. Each polymer sheet of the laminate has a thickness not exceeding about 25 µm, and the resistivity of the metal layer is from 1 to about 4 ohms square. Such laminates are useful in making capacitors and piezoelectric multimorphs. A method of making such laminates is also disclosed, wherein a plurality of metal coated polymer sheets are compressed, in the absence of an adhesive, under pressure sufficient to reduce the thickness of each of the polymeric film layers to a value that is no larger than about 25 µm.
