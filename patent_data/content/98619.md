# Direct injection internal combustion engine of the compression ignition type.

## Abstract
A direct injection internal combustion engine of a com pression ignition type, designed to improve the mixture pre paration and to reduce fuel consumption, uses a swirl injec tion nozzle 3 having relatively small penetration. The in jection port 32 of the swirl injection nozzle 3 is positioned at the central portion of a cavity 2 recessed in the piston 1 surface and having a throttled inlet opening 2h . By relying on a special ratio of the area of the inlet opening to the area of the piston top surface, on the combination of an intake swirl S and compression squish flow as well as on a sub stantial fuel spray angle Ï‘ , fuel is uniformly distributed throughout the interior of the throttled combustion cavity.
