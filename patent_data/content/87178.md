# Output amplifier for a transmitting tube.

## Abstract
An output amplifier for a transmitting tetrode 1 having an operating frequency located in the FM and the VHF frequency bands which is matched to a preamplifier. In order to match the output impedance of the preamplifier to the input impedance of the output amplifier the output amplifier must comprise a broad band impedance transformer 9, 16, 17 . The conventional solution, the use of Î» 4 coaxial conductors arranged in air, has the drawback that this implies the use of a bulky transformer. In accordance with the invention, mechanical and electrical flexibility is obtained by using impedance transformers formed from series parallel arrangements of coaxial cables 16, 17 , so that the impedance transformer needs little room and nevertheless realizes a match of a highly broadband nature.
