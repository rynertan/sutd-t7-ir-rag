# Equipment for simulated shooting.

## Abstract
The equipment simulates the firing of one or more projectiles from a gun at a target such that a beam of electromagnetic radiation replaces the projectile trajectory. The equipment comprises a projector for projecting a modulated beam of electromagnetic radiation towards a target in response to the operation of a trigger. The target has a reflective surface operable to reflect the beam back along a oath substantially parallel to the incident beam irrespective of the angle of incidence of the beam. The reflected beam is detected by a receiver which includes means for signalling the reception of a reflected beam as a hit . Optionally provision is made to cater for differences which may arise owing to the different nature of the radiation beam and the projectile which it is to simulate. The equipment may include a score unit comprising a signal processor and visual display means. The detection of a reflected beam is radiated to a detector connected to the signal processor and the hit is displayed on the visual display means as well or instead of indication at the receiver.
