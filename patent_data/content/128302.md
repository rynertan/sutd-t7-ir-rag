# Iron silicon based catalyst exhibiting high selectivity to C2 C6 alkenes in CO H2 Fischer Tropsch reactions.

## Abstract
Finely divided, hydrogen activated catalyst com positions comprising iron, silicon and carbon or iron and silicon that selectively convert gaseous mixtures of CO and H₂, at a temperature of 150 bis 450 C and at pressures of 10 2000 kPa, into reaction mixture containing at least about 75 C₂ C₆ alkenes and no more than about 25 of CH₄ and undesirable CO₂ by products are disclosed. A wide range of iron silicon based catalyst compositions are conveniently prepared by laser pyrolysis and hydrogen pretreatment and readily reactivated with hydrogen at elevated temperatures.
