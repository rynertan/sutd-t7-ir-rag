## Description
This invention relates to solid resin compositions containing relatively small amounts of water which are easily and readily dispersed in aqueous media to provide aqueous dispersions. The resin compositions of this invention are useful in the manufacture of water borne adhesives, particularly water borne pressure sensitive adhesives. European Patent Application, Serial No. 0085471, describes a blend suitable for providing an aqueous emulsion of a hydrocarbon resin comprising from 3 to 10 parts by weight of an emulsifier of the class of nonionic polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ethers, anionic alkyl aryl sulfonates and mixtures thereof blended with a mixture of from 3 to 10 parts by weight of resinplast, such as naphthenic oil, and 80 to 94 parts by weight of said hydrocarbon resin with water through an inversion method comprising the sequential steps of admixing from 3 to 10 parts by weight of an emulsifier of the class consisting of nonionic polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ethers, anionic alkyl aryl sulfonates and mixtures thereof with from 80 to 97 parts by weight of a molten hydrocarbon resin and from 0 to 10 parts by weight of a resinplast, heating said admixture above the softening point of the resin, emulsifier, resinplast mixture, slowly adding water heated to about 1000C to said heated admixture with vigorous stirring over a critical minimum period and until inversion occurs, adding sufficient additional water with agitation to provide an aqueous emulsion containing from 30 to 75 weight water. There is no disclosure of any water being present in the blend of this European Patent Application, or any recognition of the need for water to be present or of the need to control the amount of water present. The ratio of water to anionic emulsifying agent is critical to the preparation of the solid resin compositions or emulsifiable concentrates of this invention. If no water or too little water is used, an emulsifiable concentrate will not be formed. If too much water is added, i.e., more than 60 moles of water to about 100 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent, unstable dispersions having large particles are formed. For example, when one uses 100 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent, you get a dispersion having a particle size of,2,000 microns. Such dispersions are unstable on storage and do not have properties useful in the preparation of pressure sensitive adhesives. Beyond 100 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent, you simply get a layer of resin and a layer of the water and anionic emulsifying agent. The solid resin compositions or emulsifiable concentrates of this invention have improved stability, are easy to transport and store, and are not highly subject to freezing in cold climates at about OOF to about 200F or lower.Emulsifiable as used herein means capable of forming a stable dispersion. This invention provides a solid resin composition containing a resin and at least one anionic emulsifying agent, characterized in that it contains from 20 to 60 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent. The solid resin composition of this invention is further characterized in that it contains, by weight, 1 from about 828 to about 95 of a resin or resin blend having a melt viscosity of greater than 100,000 centipoise at 600C and a R softening point greater than 600C, 2 from about 3 to about 5 of at least one anionic emulsifying agent, and 3 from 20 to 60 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent, the total of 1 , 2 and 3 being 100 .Preferably the resin composition consist essentially of from about 85 to about 92 resin, from about 3 to about 5 of the anionic emulsifying agent, and 20 to 40 moles of water per mole of anionic emulsifying agent. Generally, the solid resin compositions will have a melt viscosity of greater than 100,000 cps to about 200,000 cps at 600C and a R softening point greater than 600C to about 1400C. Preferably the resin will have aR softening point from about 800C to about 1200C. The compositions are prepared by thoroughly admixing or blending the anionic emulsifying agent and the resin in a suitable mixing vessel equipped with a stirrer until an essentially homogeneous blend is formed. Blending is carried out at an elevated temperature up to about 1400C, preferably from about 950C to about 1250C. The anionic emulsifying agents useful in the practice of this invention are commercially available. Most of these emulsifying agents contain certain amounts of water. Generally those emulsifying agents available as an aqueous dispersion are from about 25 to about 75 active, the remainder being primarily water. Resins used as component 1 can be a an ester of rosin, and b low molecular weight polymers and copolymers of hydrocarbon monomers, provided the resin used has the following properties a melt viscosity of greater than 100,000 centipoise at 600C and a R softening point greater than 600C.
