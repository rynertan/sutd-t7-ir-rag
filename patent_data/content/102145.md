# Reinforced resin composites.

## Abstract
Inorganic filler reinforced thermoplastic composites, especially mica reinforced polypropylene composites, are prepared by a hot melt mixing process in which the mix contains propylene polymer waxes, in an amount up to about 10 percent by weight based upon the mica. The propylene polymer wax may be degraded, hydrocarbon isotactic polypropylene, or derivatized polypropylene wax such a maleated or sulphonated polypropylene wax. The wax has the effect of increasing the tensile strength and durability of the composite, and providing a smooth, uniform and glossy surface finish.
