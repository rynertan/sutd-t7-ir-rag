# High energy density electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell has a metallic anode, a cathode electrolyte having a salt of the anode metal dissolved therein and means electrochemically compling the anode and ca thode electrolyte, the cathode electrolyte comprising an elec trolyte solvent selected from aprotic inorganic liquid oxides, liquid halides and liquid oxyhalides, and an interhalogen having a discharge potential higher than that of the electrolyte sol vent.
