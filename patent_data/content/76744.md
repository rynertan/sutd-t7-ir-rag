# Surgical stapler apparatus with curved staple pusher.

## Abstract
Surgical stapler apparatus of the type in which a surgical staple 40 is formed around an anvil 62 . The staple 40 is driven by a longitudinally curved pusher 80 which forms an arc of a circle and which is arcuately reciprocal in a similarly curved channel 70 . The distal end portion of the curved channel 70 is substantially tangent to the plane of the distal most staple 40 in a stack of staples 40 , and the proximal end portion of the staple pusher 80 is substantial ly parallel to the longitudinal axis 12 of the stack to provide a very compact stapler configuration.
