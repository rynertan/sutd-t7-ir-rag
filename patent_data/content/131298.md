# PRETREATMENT COMPOSITIONS FOR METALS

## Abstract
Solid and aqueous compositions containing a Jernstedt salt, a phosphate, a polyphosphate, a silicate, a carbonate, a hyroxide, a sequestrant, an anionic surfactant and a non ionic surfactant. The aqueous solutions can be used at tempera tures as low as 100 F to effectively clean and condition metallic surfaces prior to the application thereto of a conver sion coating.
