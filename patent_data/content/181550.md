# Crimpable capping assembly for a centrifuge tube.

## Abstract
A separate capping assembly for a centrifuge tube includes a stopper having a plug adapted for close fitting receipt on the interior of the neck of the tube being sealed and a complimentary tubular sleeve sized for close fitting receipt over the exterior of the tube neck. The sleeve is responsive to a radially inwardly directed force by deform ably crimping to compress the material of the neck of the bottle into an annular seal defined between the plug and the sleeve. The annular seal so formed resists fluid leakage from the interior of the tube during centrifugation of the tube.
