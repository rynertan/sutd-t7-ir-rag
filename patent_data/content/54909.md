The compounds of the present invention may be prepared, for example, by the aforementioned process, which will be described below more fully in sequence of reactions. 1 Preparation of l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ols and their derivatives IV A prenyl halide II , one of the starting materials, is reacted with magnesium in a conventional manner to give a prenyl magnesium halide. The reaction is carried out usually in an etheric solvent such as ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane or the like at a temperature of from 300C to room temperature, preferably from 20 to OOC. Magnesium is used in an equimolar or small excess amount based on the prenyl halide. In order to allow the reaction to proceed smoothly, a small amount of iodine, an alkyl bromide, an alkylene dibromide or the like may be added to activate the magnesium. The reaction is completed usually in 20 minutes to several hours. The resulting prenyl magnesium halide is then reacted with an epihalohydrin, which is normally used in solution in an etheric solvent exemplified above. The reaction is preferably carried out by dropwise addition of a solution of prenyl magnesium halide to a solution of epihalohydrin, because such addition manner aids in improving the selectivity of the reaction and minimizing the formation of byproducts. The reaction temperature is between 400C and 500C, preferably 300C and 0 C. The epihalohydrin is used in an amount almost equimolar with the prenyl magnesium halide. The addition of a small amount of a cuprous halide such as cuprous iodide or cuprous bromide aids in improving the selectivity of the reaction.The cuprous halide may be added in an amount of 0.01 to 0.1 equivalent based on the epihalohydrin. The reaction is usually completed in 20 minutes to several hours. Thereafter, the reaction mixture may be worked up according to the conventional techniques in organic chemistry, for example, by acid treatment, evaporation of solvent, washing, solvent extraction and distillation, to recover a purified product. However, even a product of low purity may successfully be used for aforementioned purposes i.e., as a starting material in the subsequent step . Preferably the thus obtained l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol is then protected at the 2 hydroxyl group prior to use in the subsequent reaction when it is used as an intermediate for the synthesis of lRS, 4SR, 5RS 4 4,8 dimethyl 5 hydroxy 7 nonenyl 4 methyl 3,8 dioxabicyclot3.2.1 octane 1 acetic acid iA . The protection may be effected with a compound having the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 is a lower alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or hexyl R2 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl or ethyl R3 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms slch as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or hexyl or 3 R1 and R3 may together form an alkylene chain such as tri methylene, tetramethylene or pentamethylene 4 R is CH2OCH3, CH2OCH2CH2OCH3, CH2Ph or Si CH3 3, and X is as defined above.The compound of Formula VIII or IX includes, for example, 5,6 dihydro 4H pyran, methyl vinyl ether, methyl isopropenyl ether, butyl vinyl ether, butyl isopropenyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, chloromethyl methyl ether, chloromethyl propyl ether, benzyl chloride, benzyl bromide and trimethylsilyl chloride. Among these protecting agents, alkyl vinyl ethers VIII are generally used in the presence of an acid catalyst to protect the hydroxyl group of a l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol. Useful acid catalysts include p toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, acidic ionexchange resin and the like. A solvent such as benzene, toluene, ether, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, dioxane, dimethylformamide or hexane may be used, although the reaction may be carried out without solvent. The reaction temperature is usually from room temperature to 800C and the reaction time is from 10 minutes to several hours.The protecting agent of Formula VIII may usually be employed in an equimolar or. small excess amount based on the amount of l halo 6 methyl 5hepten 2 ol being protected. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is neutralized and the solvent and the excess protecting agent are distilled off to recover an etheric compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and X are as defined above, said compound being the desired hydroxyl protected l halo 6methyl 5 hepten 2 ol. On the other hand, when a halide IX is used as a protecting agent, a l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol may be reacted with the halide in the presence of a base to achieve the purpose of protecting the hydroxyl group. The base which is used in the reaction includes tertiary amines such as triethylamine and pyridine, metal hydrides such as lithium hydride and sodium hydride and metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The reaction is usually carried out by adding a base to a mixture of a l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol and an equimolar or excess protecting agent dissolved in a suitable solvent tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, dioxane or the like . When an amine is used, the reaction may be conducted without solvent. The reaction temperature is usually from room temperature to 1000C and the reaction time is from 1 hour to 1 day. Alternatively, in the preparation of l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2ol, the resulting reaction mixture may be reacted with an equimolar or small excess halide IX at a temperature of from room temperature to refluxing temperature for 1 hour to 1 day, instead of the acid treatment, thereby directly yielding the desired hydroxylprotected l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol. In either case, the desired protected compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein X and R4 are as defined above, may be isolated by subjecting the reaction mixture to washing, extraction and removal of solvent by distillation, for example. The crude compound X or XI obtained as above may further be purified by column chromatography or the like in a conventional manner, while it is also possible to use the crude product in the subsequent step as it is without further purification. The l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ols and their derivatives of Formulas IV , X or XI include, for example l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol l iodo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl tetrahydropyran 2 ylehter l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l iodo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 methoxyethyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 methoxyethyl ether. l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 ethoxyethyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 ethoxyethyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl l n butoxyethyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl l n butoxyetflyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 isobutoxyethyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 1 isobutoxyethyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl methoxymethyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl methoxymethyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 2 methoxyethOxyethyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl 2 methoxyethoxyethyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl benzyl ether l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl benzyl ether l chloro 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl trimethylsilyl ether and l bromo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 yl trimethylsilyl ether. 2 Preparation of l halo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanols and their derivatives V The compound V may be prepared by epoxidization of a l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol or its derivative obtained by the reaction s described in 1 above. The epoxidizing aqent used in this reaction includes organic peracids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, perbenzoic acid and peracetic acid, organic hydroperoxides such as tert butyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. When Y represents a protecting group, the desired epoxy compound V may also be prepared by reacting the hydroxylprotected compound IV with a halogenating agent such as Nbromosuccinimide, N chlorosuccinimide or t butyl hypochlorite and then treating the resulting halohydrin compound with a base. A wide variety of solvents including chloroform, dichloromethane, benzene and water may be used. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature of 200C to room temperature for 10 minutes to several hours. The epoxidizing agent is used in an equimolar or slight excess amount based on the l halo 6 methyl 5 hepten 2 ol or its derivative IV . The reaction mixture may be worked up according to the conventional manner in organic chemistry, for example, by decomposition of the excess epoxidizing agent, washing, extraction and evaporation of solvent to isolate the desired product. The thus obtained crude product may further be purified by column chromatography or similar technique, while it can be used in the subsequent step as it is. The l halo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanols and their derivatives of Formula V include l bromo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanol l chloro 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanol l iodo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanol l bromo 5 , 6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l chloro 5 , 6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l iodo 5,6 epOxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l bromo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl 1 methoxyethyl ether l chloro 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl 1 methoxyethyl ether l iodo 5, 6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl l methoxyethyl ether l chloro 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl benzyl ether l chloro 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl methoxymethyl ether l chloro 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl trimethylsilylether and l bromo 5 , 6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl benzyl ether. 3 Preparation of l halo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptanols and their derivatives VI The desired compound VI may be prepared by rearrangement of a l halo 5,6 epoxy 6 methyl 2 heptanol obtained in the reaction described in 2 above. The rearrangement of an epoxy compound into an allyl alcohol may be performed, for example, by treatment with a dialkylboryltrifluoromethanesulfonate tertiary amine chemistry Letters 1977 p.p. 1215 1218 or by reaction with an organosilicon compound such as trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate fJ. Am. Chem. Soc., 101, 2738 9 1979 J. According to another simpler method described in JapanesePatent Laid Open Specification No. 76507 1979, the epoxy V may also be treated with an aluminum trialkoxide of the formula A1 OR 3 wherein R is a primary, secondary or tertiary lower alkoxy, to effect the rearrangement. The aluminum trialkoxide useful in this method includes aluminum triisopropoxide and the like and it is generally used in an equimolar or small excess amount based on the epoxy compound V . The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as toluene, benzene, xylene or the like at a temperature of 50 to 1200C for about 1 to 10 hours. The resulting reaction mixture may be worked up, for example, by neutralization, extraction, washing and removal of solvent by distillation, according to the conventional techniques in the field of organic chemistry to isolate the desired compound VI . While the thus obtained crude compound VI may further be purified by chromatography or similar procedure, it is also possible to use the crude product in the subsequent step as it is. The l halo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptanol or its derivative of Formula VI includes, for example l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptanql l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptanol l iodo 5 hydroxy 6 me thylene 2 heptanol l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 yl ether l iodo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl tetrahydropyran 2 ylether l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 methoxyethyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl l methoxyethyl ether l iodo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 methOxyethyl ether l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 n butoxyethyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 n butoxyethyl ether l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 isobutoxyethyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl 1 isobutoxyethyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl methoxymethyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl benzyl ether l chloro 5 hydroxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl tr imethylsilyl ether l bromo 5 hydroxy 6 methylene 2 heptyl methoxymethyl ether and l iodo 5 hydroxy 6 methyl 2 heptyl benzyl ether. 4 Preparation of 9 halo 8 hydroxy 4 methyl 4 nonenoic acids and their derivatives I The compounds I may be prepared by reacting a l halo 2 substituted oxy 5 hydroxy 6 methylene heptane VI with an orthoacetic acid ester of Formula VII in the presence of a weak acid such as propionic acid, butyric acid or the like as a catalyst. Based on the compound VI , the orthoacetic acid ester VII is used in an equimolar to large excess amount and an amount of 0.01 to 0.1 equivalent of the weak acid is adequate as the catalyst. The excess orthoacetic acid ester VII may also serve as the solvent, or any suitable solvent such as xylene may be employed.The reaction may usually be carried out at a temperature of about 120 to 1500C and satisfactory results are obtained when the reaction is allowed to proceed with distilling off the alcohol formed by the reaction. The reaction is usually completed in 20 minutes to several hours. The resulting reaction mixture may be worked up by removal of solvent and or excess orthoacetic acid ester, extraction, washing and removal of solvent to isolate a 9 halo 8 substituted oxyl 4 methyl 4 nonenoic acid ester of the formula EMI11.1 wherein X, Y and R are as defined above.The crude ester XII thus obtained may further be purified by column chromatography or similar procedure. However, it is also possible to employ the crude ester in the subsequent hydrolysis as it is. The 9 halo 8 substituted oxy 4 methyl 4 nonenoic acid ester XII obtained as above is then subjected to acidic or basic hydrolysis or a combination of these whereby one of the ester moiety and the protected hydroxyl group or both of these are hydrolyzed to yield a product of the formula EMI12.1 wherein X, Y and R are as defined above.The hydrolysis may be carried out in a conventional manner in the yield of organic chemistry using an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or p toluenesulfonic acid, or a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. For example, hydrolysis of a compound XII with an alkali causes hydrolysis of only the ester moiety, resulting in the formation of a free carboxylic acid ofFormula I a , while an acidic hydrolysis causes only the elimination of the hydroxyl protecting group to give an alcoholic product of Formula I b . A 9 halo 8 hydroxy 4 methyl 4 nonenoic acid of Formula I c may be obtained by subjecting a free carboxylic acid I a prepared as above to further acidic hydrolysis. The compound I a , I b or I c thus obtained may be isolated and purified in a conventional manner in organic chemistry. Having generally described the invention, a more complete understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples, which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.EMI12.2 EMI13.1 Magnesium 670 mg, 27.6 mmole was added to tetrahydrofuran 30 ml and the mixture was cooled to 100C.
