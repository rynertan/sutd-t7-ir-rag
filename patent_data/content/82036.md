# Moving map display.

## Abstract
A moving map display used on an aircraft or other moving vehicle is disclosed. Discreet map segments are stored on a video signal storage means 13 and portions of the video signals for several map segments are read from the storage means and combined to create a composite map segment which is displayed within the aircraft or other moving vehicle. A navigation system 10 on the vehicle provides position information to a microprocessor 4 which functions with other circuitry to determine which map segment portions are to be combined to create the composite map segment.
