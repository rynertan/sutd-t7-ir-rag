# An enhanced optically sensitive medium using organic charge transfer materials to provide reproducible thermal optical erasure.

## Abstract
An enhanced optically sensitive medium is disclosed which uses an organic charge transfer complex as the switching material. The organic charge transfer complex includes at least one moiety in an oxidized state. An enhancement mechanism is taught which provides a secon dary source of natural molecules of said at least one constituent moiety in the neutral or altered oxidation state. For example, with CuTCNQ used as the switching material, the erasing characteristics can be improved by using a covering dispersion having a matrix polymer interspersed with neutral molecules of TCNQ .
