# IMPROVEMENTS IN ROTARY DRILL BITS

## Abstract
A rotary drill bit for use in drilling or coring deep holes in subsurface formations comprises a bit body 10 having a shank 11 for connection to a drill string, a plurality of cutting elements 14 mounted at the surface of the bit body, and a channel in the bit body for supplying drilling fluid to nozzles 17 in the surface of the bit body for cooling and or cleaning the cutting elements. The cutting elements 14 each comprise a thin hard facing layer 19 , defining a front cutting face, bonded to a less hard backing layer 20 , and the cutting element is mounted on a carrier 22 which is received in a socket 23 in the bit body in such manner that, at least before any wear of the bit has occurred, the carrier 22 is wholly shrouded by the material of the bit body, the carrier 22 being formed from material which is less hard than the backing layer 20 of the cutting element 14 .
