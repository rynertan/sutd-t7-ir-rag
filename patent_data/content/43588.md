# Pulse arc welding machine.

## Abstract
A pulse arc welding machine includes a consumable wire electrode 12 , a wire feeding unit 14 for the wire electrode, a base current source 9 , and a pulse current source 1, 2 for supplying a pulse current superposed on the base current. The quantity of heat applied to the electrode 12 is corrected by comparing an output detection signal produced by an arc sensor 38 with a preset arc voltage and then producing a pulse width instruction signal in response to the difference signal for setting the pulse width of the pulse current. When the detected arc voltage is large, the quantity of heat applied to the electrode 12 by the welding current is decreased and the wire feeding speed is increased, while when the arc voltage is small, the quantity of heat applied to the wire electrode is increased and the wire feeding speed decreased.
