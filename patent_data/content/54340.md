# Particulate solid storage container.

## Abstract
A storage container 1 for solid particulate materials 2 includes a source of lubrication gas A coupled to a fluidiser 4 . The fluidised particulate materials are carried from the container by a stream of transport gas B . A defector 6 placed over the container outlet 7 constrains the fluid flow in a substantially horizontal path to prevent the outlet becoming blocked by the solids when the gas flow B A is cut off. The proportions of particulate material can be varied by selectively varying the pressure in the container, where the container 1 is a pressure vessel.
