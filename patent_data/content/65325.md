# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING FLAWS IN TUBULAR METALLIC MEMBERS

## Abstract
A remote field eddy current method for detecting flaws in metallic members comprising producing an alternating magnetic field in the member at a first posi tion detecting at a remote location a small circum ferential section of the magnetic field resulting from said produced alternating magnetic field individually analyzing each of said sections of the detected magnetic field and displaying the results of said analyses. A remote field eddy current apparatus for inspecting tubular members for defects, said apparatus comprising a source coil coupled to an alternating current power source, said source coil being disposed to produce an alternating magnetic field in the tubular member a de tecting means disposed a remote distance from said source coil for detecting the remote field produced by a said source coil, said detecting means being responsive to small segments of the remote field around the peri meter of the tubular member and producing an individual signal for each segment processing means coupled to said detecting means for individually processing each of said individual signals and display means coupled to said processing means for displaying at least one characteristic of each individually processed signal, said display means displaying said individual signals in a correlatable manner.
