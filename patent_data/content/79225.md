# COMPOSITION AND TRAP FOR CAPTURING VERMIN

## Abstract
An effective composition for the capture of rodents, rats, mice, and other vermin, harmless to man and pets and useful over a wide range of temperatures, may be produced by forming a mixture including a tackifying solution compris ing either a low molecular weight linear polymer or a high molecular weight branched polymer, a solvent type softener, and a resinous substance which comprises an alkyl ester of rosin such as a methyl ester and one or more resins such as hydrogenated resins, aromatic hydrocarbon resins or the like, with the tackifying solution making up at least 86 by weight of the mixture a coagulated and polymerized rubber such as polyisoprene, making up at least .125 by weight of the mixture and being reacted with the tackifying solution and an aqueous emulsion of a rubber such as polyisoprene and including a stabilizer such as ammonia, which makes up at least 6 by weight of the mixture, the emulsion being dispersed in said tackifying solution. The invention also teaches that a vermin trap may be produced by loading such a composition into a tray.
