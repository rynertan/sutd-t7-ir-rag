# Turbine.

## Abstract
A turbine has a first nozzle means 34, 35, 36 for discharging fluid including vapor and liquid and a rotor 24, see Figures 1 and 2 to receive fluid supplied via the first nozzle means and for forming a ring of liquid 50 . The rotor 24 acts as a vapor liquid separator and a turbine rotor, the rotor having first vanes 42 to receive and pass the liquid and thereby drive the rotor and exit nozzles 47 to which liquid subjected to centrifugal pressurization in the ring of liquid 50 is delivered, the exit nozzles 47 being angled to form exit jets producing further thrust acting to drive the rotor. The invention provides an economical prime mover of low capital cost due to simple construction, high reliability, and minimum maintenance requirements.
