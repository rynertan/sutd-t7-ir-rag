# A UNIT WITH CLAMPS FOR ENGAGING THE CONDUCTORS OF A CABLE, PARTICULARLY A BIPOLAR CABLE, WITH THE CONTACT ELEMENTS FOR LAMP HOLDERS OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
A unit with clamps for engaging the conductors of a bipolar cable to the clamps comprising a substantially column shaped member with a transversal bore, a member which can be moved along the column shaped member and a spring acting along the axis of said column member on said mobile member a single element made of insulating material substitutes the mobile members of the two clamps, and is resiliently urged, so that one only thrust operation is carried out in order to engage the conductors in the clamp bores.
