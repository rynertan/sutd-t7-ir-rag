# Method of packaging a stack of tinplate sheets on a pallet, and a packaged stack produced thereby.

## Abstract
A stack of tinplate sheets 100 on a pallet 101 is packaged by two U shaped cardboard strips 103, 104 covering the sides, metal corner brackets 111, 112 and a top covering 110 . To provide a stronger package and greater protection for the tinplate sheets, a further preformed cardboard cover 108 is applied to the top of the stack so as to extend also over the said U shaped cardboard strips 103, 104 and, after the metal corner brackets 111, 112 and top covering 110 are applied, a first steel securing band 106 is applied transversely to the pallet joists 102 and a plurality of second steel securing bands 114 are applied parallel to the joists 102 .

## Description
Method of packaging a stack of tinplate sheets on a pallet, and a packaged stack produced thereby The invention relates to a method of packaging a stack of tinplate sheets stacked on a pallet having a platform supporting the stack and a plurality of joists beneath the platform, and further relates to the packaged stack produced by the method. Netherlands published patent application no.7806682 describes a method of packaging a tinplate stack in which two U shaped cardboard strips are applied to the sides of the stack, metal corner brackets are applied to the corners of the stack, a covering is applied to the top of the stack and the stack is bound. See especially the table on page 5 and Figs. 1 to 5. The use of a steel lid as shown in Figs. 2 to 4 is disadvantageous since this item is expensive and of fixed size. If such a lid has an excessive size, and so is larger than the stack, the tinplate will shift inside the lid during transit, possibly resulting in damage. The object of the present invention is to provide a method of packaging a tinplate stack which produces a package suitable for overseas export, as well as inland transport, but which can avoid the use of a steel lid as described above. Another object of this invention is to provide a simple packaging method which needs only one operator, i.e. fewer than for the conventional export packaging and also than for the conventional inland packaging. A further object of the invention is to limit the amount of variation needed in the packaging for different stack sizes and the number of different types of material used. According to the invention a first cover or lid made of pre formed cardboard is applied so as to extend also over the U shaped folded strips of cardboard at the stack sides, and, after the fitting of the corner brackets, and the top covering, a first steel band is applied transversely to the joists of the pallet and a plurality for instance four of second steel bands are applied around the package parallel to the joists. The preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of non limitative example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows, in exploded perspective view, the packaging of a stack of tinplate sheets on a pallet by a method embodying the invention, with a detail shown in Fig. la Fig. 2 also in perspective, shows the finished package of Fig. l, but with some of the layers partly omitted and Fig. 3 is a schematic section through the package of Fig. 2. In the packaging method shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the stack 100 of tinplate sheets rests on the platform 101 of a pallet which has three parallel wooden joists 102 beneath the platform 101. A layer of cardboard 109 is placed on the platform 101 before the stack is formed. First, two pre folded U shaped cardboard strips or wraps 103,104 are fitted opposite one another around the vertical side faces of the stack 100. The legs of the U shaped wraps 103,104 in this case extend at right angles to the joists 102 of the pallet, and the width of the wraps 103,104 is roughly equal to the height of the stack 100.The legs of one wrap 104 are longer than the legs of the other wrap 103, and these legs overlap each other. Then there is applied a cover formed of cardboard 108 which covers the upper face of the stack 100 and possesses preformed grooves for folding as shown inFig. 1. After it has been folded by hand by the operator it is as shown in perspective in Fig. la. The edges of the cover 108 are folded down to cover parts of the sides of the stack 100 over the two wraps 103 and 104. The material of the various layers 103,104,108 and 109 is of a special quality with high tensile strength high impact resistance and good water proofing.corner A protective bracket 111 of steel is applied to each bottom corner of the stack 100 under the platform 101 and over the wraps 103 and 104, in order to strengthen the corners and the horizontal edges of the stack 100.There are in all four lower corner brackets 111, which overlap each other in pairs a little at the middle of each side of the stack. Four wide protective corner brackets 112 made of steel are arranged at the top corners of the stack 100 outside the cardboard wraps 103,104 and the cover 108. The brackets 112 partially overlap each other at the middle of each side of the stack. Each corner bracket 111,112 has two arms at right angles and each arm consists of two flanges at right angles. The small top flanges 113 of the brackets 112 overlie the cover 108, and the wide side flanges of the brackets 112 extend down to overlap the brackets 111 so that the whole of each side face of the stack is covered. After this a top covering 110 of hardboard is placed over the whole. Then, a band 106 of strong steel is applied around the package by means of a binding machine, the band extending over the short sides of the stack 100 and its top and under the platform 101, and after connnection of its ends and tensioning it is fastened at the point 107. In a known manner ahorizontal groove is left in the middle of the top of each of the joists 102, and the steel strip 106 is threaded through these grooves in order to fasten the tinplate stack and the packaging firmly to the pallet 101. Thereafter in this embodiment, the package is trussed with four cross bands 114 of steel in the direction at rights angles to the band 106, i.e. parallel to the joists 102, thus binding the package approximately evenly between the joists 102. The package in according with the invention has been found suitable for both inland and export transport, and is easily handled by a fork lift truck. In addition the package according to the invention is itself stackable one on another, particularly if the middle joist is made a few millimetres, e.g. 5 mm, smaller in order to improve the stability of a stack of the packages. Other important advantages are that the prefolded cardboard cover 108 always fits well on the corners of the stack 100, and that the use of the bands 106 ensures great stability of the whole package during transport.The cardboard cover 108 can easily be preformed for different stack sizes.
