# Substances having antibiotic activity, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, their use in medicaments and microorganisms.

## Abstract
Substances having respectively an elemental analysis of C 55.11 H 5.74 , a molecular weight of 864 958 a melting point of 180 3 C decomp an elemental analysis of C 54.20 H 6.15 , a molecular weight of 826 1004 and a melt ing point of 193 194 C decomp and an elemental analysis of C 54.34 , H 6.03 , a molecular weight of 822 960 and a melting point of 181 182 C decomp , have been found to possess an tibiotic activity. These substances have been prepared by cul turing microorganisms of the genus Streptomyces. A prefer red strain is Streptomyces ochraceus DC 45 FERM P No. 5219 NRRL 12051 . The substances have a pale yellow colour, have activity against Bacillus subtilis No. 10707 and are soluble in methanol, ethanol and chloroform and insoluble in n hexane. These substances are of potential interest as medicaments for use against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis No. 10707 and for use as anti tumour agents.
