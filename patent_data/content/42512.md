# Current switch driving circuitry.

## Abstract
This current switch driving circuitry, particularly for, but not necessarily limited to, inductive device current switching, comprises a pair of output transistors 56, 58 constituting a driving transistor 56 for turning ON a subsequent switching transistor and a current sinking transistor 58 for turning OFF that switching transistor with circuit provision 30 for maintaining the two transistors in a low power consuming standby state. A pair of receiver circuits 74, 76 are arranged for applying ON and OFF logical signals individually to the two transistors 56, 58 by way of intermediate circuitry 30 having current multiplying circuitry for deriving the neces sary driving power with a minimum of power consumed.
