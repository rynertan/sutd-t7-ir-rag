# FET circuits.

## Abstract
A FET circuit suitable for e.g. latch, comprises a pair of inverters Q₅₁ Q₅₃, Q₅₂ Q₅₄ , therein input stage FET Q₅₁, Q₅₂ of each inverter are connected such that the gate electrode is connected to receive output si gnal of the FET of the other inverter through a circuit having a FET Q₅₄, Q₅₃ and at least a diode Q₅₁, Q₅₂ , the sources of said input stage FETs Q₅₁, Q₅₂ are connected to a common connection point C , and current source means such as a resister R₅₅ is con nected between said common connection point C and a power supply terminal 52 the circuit has a good characteristic that allowable range of the effective threshold voltage V
