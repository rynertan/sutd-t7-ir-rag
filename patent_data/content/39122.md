# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TESTING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
An apparatus for testing electrical systems of vehicles has a plurality of test circuits 12,14,16 arranged in parallel across a power supply. A selection switch 18,20,22 is associ ated with each of the test circuits 12,14,16 and each selection switch allows various items of the electrical system of the vehicle to be connected to the associated test circuit. A master switch 10 operates to connect only one of the circuits 12,14,16 to the power supply at any one time so that only one item of the electrical system of the vehicle may be tested at any one time. The apparatus may be operated manually or may be connected to a control device which allows automatic selection of the item to be tested. In carrying out the testing method, the apparatus is connected to the vehicle and the switches are operated so that tests are performed on different items of the electrical system of the vehicle selectively.
