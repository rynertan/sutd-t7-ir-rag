# Pixel magnification demagnification apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Pixel magnification demagnification apparatus and method are disclosed for controlling the size of reproducible image, the image being represented by video image signals or pixels generated by a raster scanner 12 . A binary rate multiplier 102 is used for image size control along the X axis, the multiplier being programmed to the size image desired to vary the frequency of the pixel clock signals output by the multiplier. A control flip flop 45 astride the image pixel stream is driven by the multiplier clock signals to speed up or reduce the rate at which image pixels are output with conse quent change in image size along the X axis. For image size control along the Y axis, a phase lock loop 86 control with programmable frequency generator 82 is provided for the scanning carriage drive motor 39 . The fre quency output of the generator is settable to the image size desired, changes in image size along the Y axis being achieved either by increasing or decreasing the rate at which the scanning carriage 32 is moved.
