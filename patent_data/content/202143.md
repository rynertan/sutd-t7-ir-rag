# TRIPLE CO EXTRUDER

## Abstract
An extruder provides three materials, one co extruded about the other. A first material is completely enrobed by a second material, which in turn is completely enrobed by a third material. The first and third materials are preferrably cookie doughs having differing compositions, the first material forming the core and having a moist and chewy texture upon baking. The third material is preferrably a cookie dough having a relatively crispy texture upon baking. The second material serves as a moisture barrier and to prevent bleeding between the first and the third materials. The second material may be composed of, for example, an oil based fluidic material or a gel.
