# Vortex flow meter.

## Abstract
A vortex flow meter is comprised of a vortex generator 2 provided in a fluid to be measured and a tube member 4 installed in a direction intersecting with it at the down stream side. The tube member 4 includes at least a couple of holes 4a, 4b arranged at intervals of predetermined distances in the direction of the shaft. A pressure variation Î”p due to the Karman vortex 3a, 3b created by the vortex generator 2 is applied to the fluid in the tube member 4 through the above mentioned holes 4a, 4b . A detector for sensing the pressure variation is installed in the tube mem ber 4 . The number of Karman vortexes 3a, 3b is counted by the pressure variation detector.
