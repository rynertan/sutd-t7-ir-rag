# Method for connecting or disconnecting selected stations in a ring communication system, and ring communication system including selectively connectable stations.

## Abstract
In a ring communication system comprising selectively connectable data stations, each station has connecting circuitry including a phase locked loop arrangement 111 which is frozen at its current frequency and phase in response to a signal interruption caused by a station insertion or removal operation. Control logic 113 generates a freeze control signal in dependence of the signal energy status on input lines 75 . This control signal activates gates 149, 151 and switches 155, 157 to interrupt change control signals of the phase locked loop circuitry and to keep an osciiiator control voltage at a given value. The control logic also provides an auxiliary data signal during the freeze interval which is applied to the ring to keep stations downstream in synchronism. By this method and arrangement, undesired reactions and excursions of the phase locked loop circuitry in response to a signal energy outage are prevented, and synchronization can be rapidly regained after station insertion or removal.
