# Electromechanical displacement transducer.

## Abstract
A transducer converts the amount of mechanical displace ment of a member 1 to be detected into an electrical signal with the aid of magnetic induction. Two spaced apart, oppositely wound fixed coils 11, 12 are connected in series. Inside of the fixed coils, a movable coil 9 moves in cooperative association with the member 1 to be detected. With the movable coil 9 supplied with an ac current, the fixed coils 11, 12 produce an induction current whose amplitude varies with the relative posi tion of the movable coil 9 . A signal processing circuit generates a pulse having a duty ratio corresponding to the amplitude of the induction current. The pulse is converted into a dc current at a smoothing circuit to obtain a dc voltage corresponding to the amount of mechanical displacement.
