# Distributor pump with floating piston single control valve.

## Abstract
A pump including a floating piston 64 mounted in a cavity of a cylindrical body 32 rotated by a shaft 14 . A timing chamber 62 and a metering chamber 60 are formed on either side of the floating piston 64 . The amount of fuel admitted to either chamber 60, 62 is controlled by a single electromagnetic valve 20 . The duration of energiza tion of the valve 20 determines the fuel supply to the chamber 60 from a supply annulus 40 through passage ways 82, 84, 86, 88 . Upon completion of fuel metering into the chamber 60 , the valve 20 is de energized and the fuel is admitted from the supply annulus 40 into the timing chamber 62 and also by means of a passageway 72 to the opposing faces of a pair of pumping plungers 66, 68 forcing them outward towards a predetermined position. For initiating injection the plungers are forced radially inward by an annular cam 80 , thereby increasing the pressure within the timing chamber 62 and displacing the floating piston 64 , thereby forcing the fuel out of the metering chamber 60 into a discharge connection.
