# Ceramic heater.

## Abstract
The ceramic heater of the present invention is used for regenerating a fine particle collecting filter which is exposed to exhaust gases at elevated temperatures. In this ceramic heater, which is capable of being cantilevered, two electrode portions 3, 3a are provided on a single straight or curved line m₁ and a heat generating portion is positioned on one side of said line m₁ . The heat generating portion comprises a ring like portion 1 and two leg portions 2, 2a integrally connected to the ring like portion 1 at two connecting portions 1c, 1d which approximately bisect the ring like portion 1 . The two electrode portions 3, 3a are provided at fore ends of the leg portions 2, 2a respectively, and the ring like portion 1 and the two electrode portions 3, 3a conjointly form a triangle.
