# A musical instrument with a programmed time changing coefficient digital filter.

## Abstract
A programmed time changing coefficient digital filter by which digital signals can be processed in real time, comprising a data RAM 30 for temporarily storing input data, N units of data register 26 to 29 for forming a delay means connected to an output of the data RAM, a coefficient RAM 16 for stor ing coefficients, 2N units of coefficient register 18 to 25 for temporarily storing the respective coefficients, a coefficient control 17 for replacing contents of the coefficient registers by contents of the coefficient RAM, a multiplier 31 for multi plying delayed data and coefficients read out of the data regis ters and the coefficient registers respectively, an adder 32 for accumulating data output of the multiplier and the input data, means for replacing the contents of the coefficient registers by the contents of the coefficient RAM depending on signal pro cess, and means for transferring the delayed data between the data registers and data RAM to update the delayed data in the data register, whereby providing a sum of products of the coef ficients sequentially read out of the coefficient registers and the delayed data read out of the data registers selected se quentially.
