# REDUNDANT ROWS IN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT MEMORIES

## Abstract
Decoding apparatus for an integrated circuit memory having normal rows of memory cells and at least one selectively connectable redundant second row of memory cells for being connected in place of one of the first rows, said apparatus including a redundant decoder connected to each of the at least one redundant row, the redundant decoder including a plurality of selectable connections for creating an address for each of the at least one redundant row a control signal generating circuit for generating a control signal of a first state until an address is supplied to the memory and of a second state if any of the at least one redundant row is selected by the address and, another decoder connected to receive the control signal from the generating circuit for controlling the normal rows in re sponse thereto.
