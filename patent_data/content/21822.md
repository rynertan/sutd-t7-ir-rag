# Titanium trichloride catalytic component and method for homo or co polymerization of alpha olefins.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a titanium trichloride catalytic component wherein the titanium trichloride catalytic component is separated from a solvent comprising dissolved therein a titanium tetrachloride, an organic ether compound and an organo aluminium compound, characterised in that the solvent is a mixed solvent comprising from 20 to 70 by volume, of an aromatic hydrocarbon halide and a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon and or an alicyclic hydrocarbon in the presence of an olefin, the organo aluminium compound, titanium tetrachloride and the organic ether compound being added to the mixed solvent at a solvent temperature of not more than 55 C, prior to heating the solvent to from 45 to 150 C over a period of from 10 minutes to 24 hours, which heating may be interrupted, and during the heating stage further organic ether compound and or titanium tetrachloride being added so as to obtain a catalytic component having a uniform particle diameter of from 10 to 500µ is disclosed. The thus obtained titanium trichloride catalytic compound may be used together with an organo aluminium compound as a catalyst system in the homo or copolymerization of α olefins. The invention aims at an improvement in the control of the particle size, uniformity of the particle diameter and the strength of the titanium trichloride catalytic component and hence at an improvement in the particle shape and uniformity of the polymer obtained using the catalytic component.
