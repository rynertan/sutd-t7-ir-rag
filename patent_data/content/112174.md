# Serum free cell culture medium and process for making same.

## Abstract
A substitute for serum in a cell culture medium comprises fetuin, transferrin, and phosphatidylcholine having the general formula CHEM wherein R1 is either a saturated fatty acid selected from the group consisting essentially of lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid or an unsaturated fatty acid selected from the group consisting essentially of oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid and R2 is conversely either an unsaturated fatty acid selected from the group consisting essentially of oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and arachidonic acid or a saturated fatty acid selected from the group consisting essentially of lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. A serum free medium comprises such substitute together with inorganic salts, amino acids carbohydrates, buffering agents, vitamins and compounds to simulate the natural cell environment. It is capable of growing a wide range of suspension and monolayer cells.
