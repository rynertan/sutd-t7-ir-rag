# Molding compositions comprising thermoplastic elastomers, method for preparing molded articles, and molded articles.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising a thermoplastic elastomer, e.g. radial block butadiene styrene copolymer, solid resinous polymer, e.g. vinyl substituted aromatics, and one or more specific polar compounds. The specific polar compounds are chosen from among simple and polymeric alkaline glycols, their mono and dialkyl ethers ethanolamines, isopropanolamines, and their hydrocarbyl substituted derivatives liquid acrylonitrile butadiene polymers acrylonitrile butadiene blends with homopolymers of polyvinyl chloride and styrene acrylonitrile copolymers and mixtures thereof. A method using these compositions for producing molded objects at a molding pressure of up to about 200 psig. Molded objects produced from these compositions and molded objects produced by this method of molding.
