It also relates to phenazine dyes formed from such sulfonamidodiphenylamines and photographic elements containing them. Photographic materials for producing silver and dye images are well known. It has been desirable to provide alternative means for producing a dye image, especially a dye image that enhances a silver image, other than by coupling reactions. The oxidation of leuco dyes to form an image is described in U.S. Patent 3,938,995. Reducing agents are known that autoreact intramolecularly to form a heterocyclic ring. Such reducing agents are described in, for example, U.S.Patent 3,482,971 and U.S. Patent 3,622,603. The reducing agents in these patents are formed by means of a hydroxy OH group or amino group in the position para to an NH group in the compounds. The compounds of the present invention have no such hydroxy group or amino group. The compounds of U.S.Patent 3,482,971 and U.S. Patent 3,622,603 are not disclosed as color providing materials, but rather as reducing agents and scavengers for oxidized reducing agents. According to the present invention there is provided a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor compound having sulfonamido groups in a para position and one or two of the ortho positions in relation to the NH moiety of the sulfonamidodiphenylamine and wherein the sulfonamidodiphenylamine is capable, in oxidized form, of reacting intramolecularly to produce a sulfonamido substituted phenazine dye. Preferably, the benzene ring of the diphenylamine which does not contain the parasulfonamido group contains an alkoxy, amino, mono or di alkylamino group in its para position. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is especially useful in an imaging material, such as a photographic silver halide material, to form a phenazine dye image by a crossoxidation reaction. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor does not have reducing properties that adversely affect image formation. In addition, the corresponding phenazine dye is useful as an image dye alone or as an image dye that enhances a metal image, such as a silver image, in an imaging material. The phenazine dye is also useful as a colorant for textiles, varnishes, waxes, leather, plastics, paper and paints. Combinations of color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors are also useful, if desired. A preferred class of color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors according to the invention are represented by the following formula wherein all alkyl, aryl and alkoxy groups are optionally substituted EMI3.1 wherein R is alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, decyl, eicosyl, benzyl and xylyl or aryl containing 6 to 20 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, para tolyl or 2,4,6 triiso propylphenyl Rl and RZ are individually hydrogen, alkyl containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl or NHS02R4 and at least one of Rl and R2 is NHSo2R4 R3 is alkoxy containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methoxy, methoxy, propoxy, or butoxy alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl or eicosyl orEMI3.2 R4 is alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl, eicosyl, benzyl or xylyl or aryl containing 6 to 20 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, para tolyl ord 2,4,6 triiso propylphenyl R5 is hydrogen or alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, decyl or eicosyl and R6 is alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, decyl or eicosyl. The terms alkyl , acryl and alkoxy herein include unsubstituted and substituted groups. As will be readily understood, these groups may be substituted by groups which do not adversely affect the desired properties of the sulfonamidodiphenylamines or the corresponding phenazine dyes. Examples of useful substituted alkyl groups include alkyl substituted by alkoxy, hydroxyalkoxy, carboxamido or methanesulfonamido groups. Examples of substituted aryl include methoxyphenyl, 2,4,6 triisopropylphenyl and tolyl. An optimum color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor according to the invention will depend upon such factors as the intended use, the desired image, the particular imaging material, processing steps and conditions in forming an image in the imaging material, the particular photosensitive silver halide and the imaging material containing the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor, and other components in the imaging material. An especially useful color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is one wherein R in the noted formula is 2,4,6 triisopropylphenyl EMI5.1 A 2,4,6 triisopropylphenyl group is also designated herein as follows EMI5.2 This group helps provide increased light stability to the resulting phenazine dye upon processing of the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor in a photographic silver halide material. Examples of useful color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors include 2 ,4 Bismethanesulfonamido 4 diethylaminodi phenylamine represented by the formula EMI5.3 2 Methanesulfonamido 4 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido 2 methyl 4 N 2 methanesul fonamidoethyl ethylamino diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI6.1 2 Methanesulfonamido 4t 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido 4 hydroxytrisethoxy diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI6.2 4 N 2 Methanesulfonamidoethyl ethylamino 2 methyl 2 ,4 bis 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI7.1 2,4 Bismmethaneulfonamido 4 N,N diethylamino diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI7.2 4 n Hexyloxy 2 methanesulfonamido 4 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI7.3 4 Methoxy 2 methanesulfonamido 4 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido diphenylamine represented by the formula EMI8.1 Each of the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors forms a corresponding phenazine dye by intra molecular reaction. The sulfonamidodiphenylamines may be prepared by methods known in themselves. A preferred method of preparing color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamines comprises the steps I reacting A represented by the formula EMI8.2 with B represented by the formula EMI8.3 wherein R, R2 and R3 are as defined, to produce a nitro substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine 11 reducing the resulting nitro substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine from I by means of hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst, preferably a Raney nickel catalyst and, purifying the resulting intermediate amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenyl amine then, III dissolving the purified amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine from 11 in a suitable organic solvent, such as pyridine, and reacting the amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine with a suitable sulfonyl chloride to form the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine according to the invention. An example of such a process of preparing a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is the preparation of 2 ,4 bismethanesulfonamido4 diethylaminodiphenylamine represented by the formula EMI9.1 The process of preparing this color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor comprises the steps I reacting a fluorine substituted compound represented by the formula EMI9.2 with an amine represented by the formula EMI10.1 to release hydrogen fluoride HF and to form EMI10.2 then, 11 reducing the resulting nitro substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine from I by means of hydrogen in the presence of suitable catalyst, such as a Raney nickel catalyst and, purifying the resulting intermediate amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine then, 111 dissolving the purified, amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine from 11 in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine, and reacting the amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine with methanesulfonyl chloride to form the desired sulfonamidodiphenylamine according to the invention. The described preparation of a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure. Step I in the process is generally carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as alpha picoline, 2,6 lutedine, pyridine, beta picoline and gamma picoline. This step involving the production of the nitro substituted intermediate is generally carried out at reflux temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent adverse interference from oxygen or otter components in the atmosphere.The nitro substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine intermediate is generally separated and purified prior to its reduction in step 11 of the process. This separation and purification is carried out by conventional techniques in the organic synthesis art, such as recrystallization processes. The reduction in step 11 of the process involves use of hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst. This catalyst is preferably a Raney nickel catalyst. Other useful catalysts are palladium on carbon and platinum on carbon. The conditions under which the reduction is carried out in step 11 will depend upon such factors as the particular intermediate, the presence of a solvent, the particular catalyst, and the desired intermediate amino substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine. In step III of the process, a sulfonyl chloride is suitable which provides a sulfonamido group in the ortho position in relation to the NHgroup of the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. Many sulfonyl chlorides are useful.Examples of suitable sulfonyl chlorides include alkylsulfonyl chlorides, arylsulfonyl chlorides and alkarylsulfonyl chlorides containing up to 20 carbon atoms. The alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group of the sulfonyl chloride corresponds to the alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group for Rl as defined for the colorforming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor.Examples of useful sulfonyl chlorides include methanesulfonyl chloride, triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, butanesulfonyl chloride and paratoluenesulfonyl chloride. A solvent is suitable in step III of the process which is compatible with the intermediate purified amine substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine from step it . Pyridine is an especially useful solvent. Examples of other useful solvents include alpha picoline and dioxane with triethylamine.Selection of an optimum solvent will depend upon such factors as the particular intermediate amine substituted sulfonamidodiphenylamine, the particular sulfonyl chloride, reaction conditions and the desired color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. The present invention also provides a phenazine dye having a sulfonamido group in the 2position and preferably an alkoxy, amino or a mono or dialkylamino group in the 7 position. Many phenazine dyes are prepared from the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors according to the invention. Combinations of phenazine dyes are prepared, if desired. Examples of useful phenazine dyes prepared from the colorforming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors include those represented by the formula EMI12.1 wherein R,R1,and R3 have the meanings given above. An especially useful phenazine dye is one wherein R is 2,4,6 triisopropylphenyl. This group provides increased stability for the phenazine dye. Selection of an optimum phenazine dye will depend upon such factors as the desired end use, such as the particular imaging material in which the phenazine dye is to be used, other components in the imaging material, and the desired color of the dye.Examples of useful phenazine dyes include 2 Diethylamino 7 methanesulfonamido phenazine represented by the formula EMI13.1 2 N 2 methanesulfonamidoethyl ethylamino 4 methyl 7 2,4, 6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido phenazine represented by the formula EMI13.2 2 hydroxytrisethoxy 7 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesulfonamido phenazine represented by the formula EMI14.1 2 n Hexyloxy 7 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzene sulfonamido phenazine represented by the formula EMI14.2 2 Methoxy 7 2,4,6 triisopropyl benzenesul fonamidophenazine represented by the formula EMI14.3 The hue of the phenazine dye will vary, depending upon such factors as the particular groups on the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor, processing conditions for preparation of the phenazine dye, other components in the composition containing the phenazine dye, such as dispersion solvents, and the physical form of the dye. In an imaging material, such as a photographic silver halide material, the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is generally colorless or slightly colored prior to processing. Some of the starting color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursors have a slight yellow color in an imaging material.This slight color is not considered unacceptable in many imaging materials. In some imaging materials, such as in some photographic silver halide materials, the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor absorbs radiation in certain areas of the electro magnetic spectrum which does not adversely affect the desired properties or the desired image of the phenazine dye formed upon processing. The present invention further provides a photographic element comprising a support having thereon, in reactive association, a photographic silver salt and a color forming dye precursor compound as described herein. A process of preparing a phenazine dye comprises I oxidizing a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine by means of an oxidizing agent, preferably the oxidized form of a 3 pyrazolidone reducing agent. This preparation and reaction is preferably carried out in an imaging material, such as a photographic silver halide material, in which the phenazine dye is formed imagewise. With the present photographic silver salt materials r preferably silver halides, many cross oxidizing reducing agents, also described as cross oxidizing developing agents COD , are useful for producing a phenazine dye . Any silver halide developing composition is useful for cross oxidizing purposes, provided it comprises a major proportion of a cross oxidizing reducing agent, which will cross oxidize the sulfonamidodiphenylamine precursor to the desired phenazine dye. Such a cross oxidizing reducing agent becomes oxidized during development of a silver halide photographic material by reducing exposed silver halide to silver metal. The oxidized reducing agent then cross oxidizes the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. The cross oxidizing reducing agent enables the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor to become oxidized without the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor itself developing silver. Alternatively, the cross oxidizing reducing agent is viewed as an electron transfer agent which shuttles electrons between the developing silver halide and the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. The general requirements for a suitable cross oxidizing reducing agent in a photographic silver halide material are a the reducing agent must have sufficient electrochemical potential under the conditions of use to develop exposed silver halide b in its oxidized form, the reducing agent must be of such electrochemical potential to oxidize the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor and, c in its oxidized form, the reducing agent must be sufficiently stable to undergo the redox reaction with the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. If any of the conditions are not met, the reducing agent is not a suitable cross oxidizing recuding agent for a silver halide photographic material. Whether a particular compound meets the requirements of a cross oxidizing reducing agent depends upon the conditions under which the cross oxidation reaction occurs.Other factors which influence the cross oxidation reaction include the temperature of the process, the length of time required for cross oxidation, and the pH of the composition in which cross oxidation is to occur. Examples of useful cross oxidizing reducing agents include 3 pyrazolidone cross oxidizing reducing agents. Preferred 3 pyrazolidone cross oxidizing reducing agents include l phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, l phenyl 4,4 dimethyl 3 pyrazolidone and 4 hydroxymethyl 4 methyl 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone. Such cross oxidizing reducing agents are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,938,995. Combinations of cross oxidizing reducing agents are also useful, if desired. Combinations of non cross oxidizing silver halide reducing agents and cross oxidizing reducing agents are also useful if a minor proportion of the non cross oxidizing recuding agent is present, such as less than about 10 percent of the total of the reducing agents. examples of combinations of a non cross oxidizing recuding agent and a cross oxidizing reducing agent include 4 hydroxymethyl 4 methyl l phenyl 3 pyrazolidone with a minor proportion of at least one of the non cross oxidizing reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, hydroquinone and pyrimidine derivatives.Selection of an optimum silver halide reducing agent or reducing agent combination will depend upon such factors as the desired image, the particular photosensitive silver halide, processing conditions, and the particular phenazine dye to be formed. The photographic materials comprise a photographic metal salt, preferably a photographic silver salt such as photographic silver halide. It is essential that the photographic metal salt not adversely affect the desired imaging process, such as the intramolecular reaction that occurs in the photographic material. Examples of useful photographic silver halides are silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromoiodide, silver iodide and mixtures thereof. The photographic silver halide is generally present in the photographic material in the form of an emulsion which is a dispersion of the photographic silver halide in a suitable binder. The photographic silver halide is present in a range of grain sizes from fine grain to coarse grain.The composition containing the photographic silver halide is prepared by any of the well known procedures in the photographic art, such as described in ResearchDisclosure, December 1978, Item No. 17643. The photographic silver halide material contains addenda commonly used in photographic silver halide materials, such as chemical sensitizers, brighteners, antifoggants, emulsion stabilizers, light absorbing or scattering materials, hardeners, coating aids, plasticizers, lubricants and antistatic materials, matting agents, development modifiers and other addenda described in Research Disclosure, December 1978, Item No. 17643. A photographic silver halide composition containing the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is generally spectrally sensitized by means of spectral sensitizing dyes, as described in, for example, the above Research Disclosure ItemNo. 17643. Dyes which are useful for spectrally sensitizing silver halide photographic materials are selected from such classes of spectral sensitizing dyes as polymethine dyes, which include the cyanines, complex cyanines and merocyanines including tri, tetra and polynuclear cyanines and merocyanines , as well as oxonols, hemioxonols, styryls, merostyryls and streptocyanines. Combinations of spectral sensitizing dyes are also useful. The described color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is in any suitable location in the photographic material which produces the desired phenazine dye upon processing. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor should be in a location with respect to the photosensitive silver halide which produces the desired dye image and the desired silver image upon processing. If desired, a proportion of the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is in a layer contiguous to the layer of the photographic element comprising photosensitive silver halide. The term in reactive association as used herein means that the photosensitive silver halide and the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor are in a location with respect to each other which enables the photographic material upon processing to produce a desired phenazine dye image and a desired silver image. A range of concentrations of photographic silver halide is present in the photographic material. An optimum concentration of photographic silver halide will depend upon such factors as the desired image, processing conditions, particular dye precursor, other components in the photographic material, and particular cross oxidizing reducing agent in the photographic material. A useful concentration of photographic silver halide in the photographic material is within the range of 1 mole to 1O moles of photographic silver halide per mole of dye precursor in the photographic material. The coverage of photographic silver halide may be less than otherwise might be useful, due to the enhancing properties of the phenazine dye produced upon processing of the photographic material. The silver halide developing agent or developing agent combination can be incorporated in the photographic material. Generally, the developing agent is most useful in a processing solution or it may be incorporated in the photographic element to produce a desired phenazine dye image and silver image. The cross oxidizing developing agent is useful in a range of concentrations in the photographic material or in a processing composition in which the photographic material is processed. A useful concentration of developing agent when the developing agent is present in the photographic material is within the range of O.1 to 1.O mole of developing agent per mole of color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor in the photographic material. A useful concentration of developing agent in the processing solution for processing a photographic material containing a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is within the range of 0.5 to 2 g of developing agent per liter of processing solution. The term developing agent herein includes compounds which are developing agents and developing agent precursors. That is, those compounds are included which are not developing agents in the photographic material until a condition occurs, such as contact with a suitable activator for the photographic material. The tone of the silver image and dye image produced in a photographic material varies, depending upon such factors as the silver morphology of the developed silver image, the covering power of the silver materials, the particular phenazine dye formed, the particular developing agent, processing conditions, and concentration of components. In photographic materials that provide a brown silver image, a phenazine dye produced from the described color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is especially useful which is complementary in hue to the silver image. The photographic materials generally comprise a binder. Binders are useful alone or in combination in a photographic material. Useful binders include both naturally occurring substances such as proteins, for example, gelatin, gelatin derivatives, cellulose derivatives, polysaccharides such as dextran, gum arabic and the like and synthetic polymeric materials such as water soluble polyvinyl compounds like polyvinyl pyrrolidone and acrylamide polymers. If desired, the photographic elements may contain an overcoat layer and or interlayer and or subbing layer to provide desired properties. The overcoat layer, for example, increases resistance to abrasion and other markings on the element. The overcoat layer, interlayer or subbing layer contain, alone or in combination, vehicles and binders that are useful in the layer of the element containing the photosensitive silver halide. Gelatin is an especially useful binder. A photographic element comprises a variety of supports. Useful supports include those which are resistant to adverse changes in structure due to processing conditions and which do not adversely affect the desired sensitometric properties of the photographic materials. Useful supports include cellulose ester, poly vinyl acetal , poly ethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate films, as well as related films and resinous materials. Glass, paper, metal and the like supports are also useful. A flexible support is generally most useful. Photographic materials are coated on a suitable support by procedures known in the photographic art. Such procedures include, for example, immersion or dip coating, roller coating, reverse roll coating, air knife coating, doctor blade coating, spray coating, extrusion coating, bead coating, stretch flow coating and curtain coating. In preparing an imaging composition comprising the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor, a dispersion solvent, also described herein as a coupler solvent, is useful to produce a coating composition. Many suitable coupler solvents known in the photographic art are also useful for aiding the dispersion of the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor or the corresponding phenazine dye produced upon processing. Examples of useful coupler solvents include N n butylacetanilide, diethyl lauramide, di n butyl pbthalate and 2,4 ditertiaryamylphenol.The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is also usefully loaded into a latex or a non solvent dispersion is prepared, if desired. Photographic elements are usefully imagewise exposed by means of various forms of energy. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor and the corresponding phenazine dye are relatively insensitive to light. However, the photosensitive component of the photographic element, such as photosensitive silver halide, is energy sensitive, especially photosensitive.The forms of energy which are useful to imagewise expose the photosensitive component include those to which photosensitive silver halide is sensitive and encompass such forms of energy as the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as electron beam and beta radiation, gamma rays, X rays, alpha particles, neutron radiation and other forms of corpuscular wave like radiant energy, and either noncoherent random phase forms or coherent in phase forms, as produced by lasers. Imagewise exposure of the photographic material is monochromatic, orthochromatic or panchromatic, depending upon the spectral sensitization of the photosensitive silver halide. Imagewise exposure is generally for a sufficient time and intensity to produce a developable latent image in the photographic material. The described photographic material containing the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor may be processed either in a process which produces a positive phenazine dye image, or in a process which produces a negative phenazine dye image with or without a silver image in each case. The photosensitive silver halide contained in the photographic material is processed following exposure to form a visible image by associating the silver halide with an aqueous alkaline medium in the presence of a cross oxidizing reducing agent contained in the medium or in the photographic material. If a reversal phenazine dye image is desired in the photographic material, a process is most useful in which a non cross oxidizing developing composition is used for processing the exposed photographic material as a first development step. During this step, the exposed silver halide is reduced to elemental silver by the non cross oxidizing developing composition. The non cross oxidizing developing composition does not, when oxidized, oxidize the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor to its corresponding phenazine dye. The non cross oxidizing developer compositions useful in this step are generally alkaline solutions comprising a non cross oxidi2ing reducing agent. Non cross oxidizing reducing agents are well known in the photographic art and include many silver halide reducing agents which will reduce exposed silver halide to silver, but will not cross oxidize the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor to a corresponding phenazine dye. In a second step of the process for forming a reversal phenazine dye image, fogging is accomplished by exposing the photographic element to light or by chemical fogging by means of fogging compositions known in the photographic art. Following the described fogging step, a second silver halide developing step is carried out.This is carried out by means of a cross oxidizing developing composition. It is in this step that the phenazine dye image is formed. Many silver halide developing compositions are useful in this step, provided that the developing composition cross oxidizes the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor to a desired phenazine dye.Such silver halide developing compositions include aqueous alkaline solutions comprising a cross oxidizing silver halide reducing agent, such as a 3 pyrazolidone cross oxidizing silver halide reducing agent. The cross oxidizing reducing agent becomes oxidized during development by reducing exposed or fogged silver halide to silver metal. The oxidized developer then cross oxidizes the color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor to produce the desired phenazine dye. A positive phenazine dye image is formed. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor is also usefully incorporated in a photothermographic material, such as a photothermographic silver halide material.Photothermographic materials in which the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor may be incorporated are described in, for example, ResearchDisclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029. For example, a dye image or dye and silver image is produced in a photothermographic material comprising, in binder, in reactive association a a photographic silver halide, such as a photographic silver halide emulsion b a cross oxidizing photographic silver halide developing agent c an activating concentration of a suitable base release agent and d a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor.The photothermographic material is generally imagewise exposed to light to provide a developable latent image which is then developed by merely uniformly heating the photothermographic element to processing temperature, such as a temperature within the range of about 1000C to about 180 C. This also enables formation of the desired phenazine dye.Another form of photothermographic material comprises, in binder, in reactive association a photographic silver halide, which is formed in situ or ex situ b an oxidation reduction image forming combination comprising i an organic metal salt oxidizing agent, especially a silver salt of a fatty acid, such as silver behenate, silver laurate or silver stearate, with ii an organic cross oxidizing reducing agent for the oxidizing agent, such as a 3 pyrazolidone reducing agent and c a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor as described.This photothermographic material is also imagewise exposed to light and then uniformly heated to provide a silver image and a phenazine dye image. An advantage of the described phenazine dyes in a photographic material is that the dyes provide satisfactory stability to post processing conditions and visible light exposure. A simple test is useful for establishing the degree of stability which is desired for a phenazine dye image produced from a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor.One such test is a test known in the photographic art in which the processed photographic element is exposed to a Simulated Average North American Skylight SANS with continuous 5,400 LUX of exposure at an average temperature of 210C at 45 percent relative humidity.A comparison of the stability of the tested phenazine dye is then observed. The color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor may be incorporated in a photographic silver halide processing composition for producing a dye enhanced silver image. Such a processing composition comprises a cross oxidizing photographic silver halide developing agent and the desired color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor or a combination of such dye precursors. The photographic processing composition is, for example, a silver halide developing composition, a hardener composition or a stabilizing composition. The processing composition generally comprises a base or base release agent, such as sodium hydroxide, trisodium phosphate and potassium carbonate.An example of a suitable photographic silver halide processing composition comprises a 3 pyrazolidone cross oxidizing photographic silver halide developing agent and a color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor comprising 2 methanesulfonamido 4ss 2,4,6 triisopropylbenzene sulfonamido 2 methyl 4 N 2 methanesulfonamidoethyl ethylamino diphenylamine. The described photographic material may contain a silver halide developing agent. When a silver halide developing agent is present in the photographic material, a developed image is produced after imagewise exposure of the photographic material by contacting the material with an alkaline activator solution which enables development of the exposed silver halide, as well as production of the desired phenazine dye. Many alkaline activators are useful for developing an image in a photographic material comprising an incorporated silver halide developing agent. Useful alkaline activators include those that have been found useful in the photographic art, such as in stabilization processing. Examples of useful alkaline activators include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, trisodium phosphate 12H20 pH 12 , sodium metaborate pH 12 , disodium phosphate and monosodium phosphate. The optimum alkaline activator will depend upon such factors as the desired image, the particular developing agent, processing conditions, and the particular color forming sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. An especially useful alkaline activator comprises trisodium phosphate pH 12 . The alkaline activator is useful in a range of concentrations. A generally useful concentration of alkaline activator is within the range of 10 to 50 g of alkaline activator per liter of activator solution which produces a pH in the range of 11 to 12. An optimum concentration of alkaline activator will depend upon such factors as the particular activator, the desired image, processing conditions, particular photosensitive silver halide and particular developing agent. In preparing a phenazine dye from a colorforming sulfonamidodiphenylamine for compositions and uses that are non photographic, other oxidizing agents are useful than the oxidized form of a cross oxidizing reducing agent. Such oxidizing agents include, for example, organic peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide and hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxides, ferricyanides, dichromates and permanganates. The following examples are included for a further understanding of the invention.Example 1 Preparation of 4 diethylamino 2 z4 bis methanesulfonamido diphenylamine The following preparation was carried out EMI28.1 A solution of 42.1 g 0.18 mole of 4 fluoro 3 nitro methanesulfonamidobenzene and 29.5 g 0.18 mole of N,N diethyl 1,4 phenylenediamine in 250 ml of a picoline solvent was refluxed overnight under nitrogen. The mixture was then pouredOver ice and, after the ice had melted, the mixture was filtered.The collected solid product was washed with water until clear washings were obtained, air dried, and recrystallized from ethyl acetate to provide 53.6 g of red solid identified as 4 diethylamino 3 nitro 4 methanesulfonamidodiphenyl amine having a melting point of 1680C to 170 C. The compound was also identified by elemental analysis. Then the following reaction sequence was carried out EMI29.1 A solution of 20 g 0.053 mole of 4 diethylamino 3 nitro 4 methanesulfonamido diphenylamine in 400 ml of degassed tetrahydrofuran was reduced with hydrogen over Raney nickel catalyst at room temperature at 275 kPa. The Raney nickel catalyst was removed by filtration, and the filtrate concentrated to dryness under nitrogen to protect it from air oxidation. A dark blue gum was obtained.This was dissolved in 250 ml of pyridine and treated with methanesulfonyl chloride. After stirring overnight at room temperature, the solution was poured into 2 liters of water and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined, washed 5 times with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. After concentration to dryness, a deep red gum which had the odor of pyridine was obtained. This was dissolved in 75 ml of toluene and titrated with about 125 ml of ligroin. A gum precipitated on the sides of the flask. After adding another 200 ml of ligroin with scratching and vigorous stirring, the gum began to solidify. A dark rose colored solid was collected that had the odor of pyridine. The solid was dissolved in 100 ml of ethyl acetate, washed with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. Concentration to dryness yielded a bright red glass. Thin layer chromatography indicated one major air sensitive component, some magenta dye and several minor impurities.The product was recrystallized twice from 100 ml of toluene containing a trace of ethyl acetate to produce a very pale pink solid having a melting point of 1350C to 137 C. Mass spectrographic analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed the identity of the desired product as 4 diethylamino 2 4 bis methanesulfonamido diphenylamine. The product was also identified by elemental analysis. The phenazine dye generated oxidatively from the sulfonamidodiphenylamine by means of KjFe CN 6 had a maximum absorption in butyl acetate of 472 nm. Examples 2 to 6 The following sulfonamidodiphenylamines were also prepared by methods analogous to that ofExample 1.Example 2EMI31.1 This compound had a melting point of 47 to 55 C. Example 3EMI31.2 This compound had a melting point of 185 to 187 C. Xxamole 4EMI32.1 This compound had a melting point of 145 to 147 C. Examnle 5EMI32.2 This compound had a melting point of 98 to 100 C.ExamPle 6EMI32.3 This compound had a melting point of 113 to 115 C. Each of the above compounds was also identified by elemental analysis.Examples 7 and 8 The corresponding phenazine dye was prepared from the sulfonamidodiphenylamine of Example 1 and from 4 methoxy 2 ,4 bis methanesulfonamido di phenylamine by the following procedure A butyl acetate solution of the color forming dye precursor was stirred rapidly with an aqueous solution of K3Fe CN 6. After oxidation, the butyl acetate layer was washed with water and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield the desired phenazine dye. The following phenazine dyes were produced in this manner EMI33.1 m.p. 216 217 C m.p. 287 289 C Each of the phenazine dyes was identified by elemental analysis.Example 9 Use in a Photographic Element A photographic silver halide element was prepared by coating the following layer on a poly ethylene terephthalate film support silver bromide 9.72 mg dm2 gelatin binder 43.2 mg dm2 bis vinylsulfonylmethyl ether 0.432 mg dm2 gelatin hardener dye precursor 13.6 mg dm2 EMI34.1 di 2 butyl phthalate coupler 13.6 mg dm2 solvent The resulting photosensitive silver halide layer was dried and then overcoated with a layer containing gelatin 10.8 mg dm2 and bis vinylsulfonylmethyl ether hardener 0.108 mg dm2 . A strip of the resulting photographic film was imagewise exposed through a step tablet in a commercial sensitometer to produce a developable image in the film. It was processed at 220C by immersing the film in an agitated tank containing a developer composition. The developer composition contained the following Nas P04 12H,O 47.5 g 4 hydroxymethyl 4 methyl 1 1.0 g phenyl 3 pyrazolidone benzyl alcohol 10.0 ml distilled water to 1 liter The film was immersed in the described developer for 30 seconds and then rinsed with water for 60 seconds. The film was then fixed by immersing the developed film in a fixer composition containing the following components Na2 S2 03 5H2O 248 g Na2CO3H2O 30 g NaHCO3 5g distilled water to 1 liter The film was fixed for 30 seconds and then washed with water for 5 minutes. The film was then permitted to air dry. The resulting developed silver plus dye image produced a maximum density in the first step of the step tablet of 1.2 and a minimum density in the eleventh step of the step tablet of 0.46. An orange phenazine dye image having a maximum absorption of 471 nm was generated during the described processing.This orange dye was a phenazine dye corresponding to the sulfonamidodiphenylamine dye precursor. The phenazine dye image produced a maximum density of 0.79 to blue light.
