## Description
This invention relates to novel condensates that are products of the reaction of at least one cyclic urea, glyoxal, and at least one polyol and to their use in treating textiles and paper, and to novel intermediates for the formation of these condensates. The use of glyoxal and of thermosetting resins to impart crease resistance and dimensional stability to textile materials and to insolublise the binders in paper coating compositions is well known. These resins, known as aminoplast resins , include the products of the reaction of formaldehyde with such compounds as urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, dihydroxyethylene urea or melamines. A serious drawback to the use of such materials is that they contain free formaldehyde. This is present during the preparation and storage of the agent and its use in treating textiles or paper, on the treated fabric or paper, and on the finished garments. Also, when the fabrics or garments made therefrom are stored under humid conditions, additional free formaldehyde is produced. The presence of even less than one percent of free formaldehyde, based on the total weight of the product, is undesirable, not only because of its unpleasant odour, but because it is an allergen and an irritant, causing severe reactions in the operators who manufacture the agent and who treat and handle the treated fabrics and paper and to persons who handle and wear garments fabricated from the treated fabrics. These problems associated with the presence of free formaldehyde on treated fabrics are well known and considerable efforts have been made to produce formaldehyde free textile treating agents and insolubilisers for the binders in paper coating compositions. Glyoxal is a highly reactive monomer which cures quickly and has excellent crosslinking and insolubilising properties. As a result of this rapid crosslinking of glyoxal and binder, however, the viscosity of the composition may increase so rapidly and become so great that the composition cannot be used. Frequently glyoxal insolubilsed coatings gel completely, particularly in high solids formulations gelling can occur also in moderate or low solids formulations if they are not used promptly. Thus in situations where it is required that the viscosity remain stable for many hours, for example when high solids coatings are to be applied by blade coating techniques, a glyoxal system is unsuitable. Formaldehyde free agents for treating textiles have been disclosed in U.S. patents nos.4,285,690 and 4,332,586 and formaldehyde free insolubilisers for binders in paper coating compositions have been disclosed in U.S. patent no.4,343,655. It has now been found that condensates prepared from at least one cyclic urea, glyoxal, and at least one polyol are excellent crosslinking agents for textiles and insolubilisers for binders in paper coating compositions and do not contain formaldehyde. In accordance with this invention, novel cyclic urea glyoxal polyol condensates are prepared. They are useful for crosslinking cellulosic textile fabrics and insolubilising binders in paper coating compositions. The glyoxal cyclic urea polyol condensate may be prepared by any suitable and convenient procedure. Generally the glyoxal, at least one cyclic urea, and at least one polyol are reacted together at a temperature between room temperature up to reflux. Alternatively, the glyoxal may be reacted with a hydroxyalkylated cyclic urea, made by reacting a cyclic urea with a polyol. The ratio of amounts of glyoxal cyclic urea polyol is within the range of about 0.8 2.0 1 0.05 4.0, and preferably the amount of polyol is about 0.4 3 moles. Typically the pyrimidone glyoxal glycol condensates have IR spectra which show OH stretch at 3400 cm ¹, carbonyl at 1650 cm ¹, and C 0 stretch from 1050 1150 cm ¹, which is consistent with the theoretical structure. Cyclic ureas which may be used have the following general formulae wherein R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅ and R₆ may be the same or different and each may be H, OH, COOH, R, OR, or COOR therein R is an alkyl or a substituted alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms R₇ may be H or a polyol derived moiety such as C₂H₄OH, CH₂CH₂O C₂H₄O Typical examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, 2 imidazolidinone, pyrimid 2 one, uron, tetrahydro 5 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 one, 4,5 dihydroxy 2 imidazolidinone, 4,5 dimethoxy 2 imidazolidinone, 4 methyl 2 imidazolidinone, 4 ethyl 2 imidazolidinone, 4 hydroxethyl 2 imidazolidinone, 4,5 dimethyl 2 imidaolidinone, 4 hydroxy 5 methyl pyrimid 2 one, 4 methoxy 5 methyl pyrimid 2 one, 4 hydroxy 5,5 dimethyl pyrimid 2 one, 4 methoxy 5, 5 dimethyl pyrimid 2 one, tetrahydro 5 ethyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 one, tetrahydro 5 propyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 one, tetrahydro 5 butyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 one, and certain valuable novel compounds, namely, a 5 methylpyrimid 4 en 2 one, c 4 hydroxy 5 methylpyrimidone, d 5,5 dimethylpyrimid 3 en 2 one, b 5,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxy ethoxypyrimid 2 one, and mixtures of these including especially mixtures of a with c , b with d , and d with 4 hydroxy 5,5 dimethylpyrimid 2 one. Compounds a , b , c and d can more accurately be named as a dihydro 5 methyl 2 1H,3H pyrimidinone, c tetrahdro 4 hydroxy 5 methyl 2 1H pyrimidinone, d dihydro 5,5 dimethyl 2 1H pyrimidinone and b tetrahydro 4 2 hydroxyethyl 5,5 dimethyl 2 1H pyrimidinone. a is formula E where R₁ methyl, c is formula B where X CHCH₃, R₅ is OH and R₁, R₂, and R₆ are H, d is formula C where R₁ and R₂ are methyl, and b is formula D where R₇ is CH₂CH₂OH and R₁ and R₂ are methyl. Among the cyclic ureas suitable for use in preparing the condensates of this invention are pyrimidones that are prepared from urea, formaldehyde, an aldehyde having at least two carbon atoms and at least one a proton, a catalytic amount of acid, and a solvent. Suitable aldehydes are acetaldehyde 2 carbons, 3α protons , propionaldehyde 3 carbons, 2α protons , insobutyraldehyde 4 carbons, 1α proton , n butyraldehyde 4 carbons, 2α protons and 2 methyl butyraldehyde 5 carbons,1α proton . The aldehyde may have additional functionality incorporated, such as 5 hydroxy pentanal. Suitable solvents include water, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, alkoxy ethanols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, dimethyl formamide, dioxane, acetonitrile, and mixtures of these. These solvents have an advantage over alcohol solvents because they have a higher heat capacity that better contains the exotherm that accompanies the acid solution step, thus controlling the reaction temperature. On the other hand, alcohol solvents can reflux violently and get out of control. In general these pyrimidones are prepared by reacting the urea, formaldehyde, and other aldehyde in a 1 1 1 molar ratio. A slight deficiency in any ingredient will cause that ingredient to limit the amount of pyrimidone formed. Thus, 0.9 mole of urea rected with 1 mole of formaldehyde and 1 mole of propionaldehyde will result in the formation of 0.9 mole of pyrimidone with 0.1 mole of formaldehyde and propionaldehyde left over. The later two may subsequently react with the pyrimidone as a side reaction. Accordingly, it is preferred that the amount of any of the ingredients not deviate by more than 10 from equimolar. The amount of acid catalyst is generally within the range of about 1 to 20 mole percent, and preferably it is within the range of about 5 to 10 mole percent. The pyrimidones of this invention are preferably prepared by combining urea, formaldehyde, and accompanying aldehyde in the selected solvent at room temperature and allowed to exotherm as they react to a temperature within the range of about 45 C to reflux, and preferably to about 50 to 60 C. The reaction is held at this temperature for about 1 to 8 hours, and preferably for about 3 to 4 hours. A catalytic amount of acid is then added the temperature rises to about 75 85 C to reflux, and the reaction is held for about 2 to 12 hours. The polyol may be any of a wide variety of materials, including glycols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 butylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, polyethylene glycols having the formula HO CH₂CH₂O The condensates of this invention are suitable for use with cellulosic textile fabrics, woven or non woven, including 100 cellulosic fabrics, e.g., cotton, rayon, and linen, as well as blends, e.g., polyester cotton or polyester rayon. Such blends preferably but not necessarily contain at least 20 of cellulose. Both white and coloured printed, dyed, yarn dyed, cross dyed, etc. fabrics can be effectively treated with the resins of this invention. They are applicable also to fabrics containing fibres with free hydroxyl groups. When applying the resin of this invention to a fabric, there generally will be present an appropriate catalyst. Typical catalysts include acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, fluoboric, acetic, glycolic, maleic, lactic, citric, tartaric, and oxalic acids metal salts such as magnesium chloride, nitrate, fluoborate, or fluosilicate zinc chloride, nitrate, fluoborate, or fluosilicate ammonium chloride zirconium oxychloride sodium or potassium bisulphate amine hydrochlorides such as the hydrochloride of 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol and mixtures thereof. The amount of catalyst generally is about 0.01 to 10 percent, and preferably about 0.05 to 5 percent, based on the weight of the padding bath. The finishing agents may be applied to the textile fabric in any known and convenient manner, e.g., by dipping or padding, and will generally be applied from aqueous or alcoholic solution. The solvent may be water an aliphatic alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol or a mixture of water and an aliphatic alcohol. Other conventional additives such as lubricants, softeners, bodying agents, water repellents, flame retardants, soil shedding agents, mildew inhibitors, anti wet soiling agents and flourescent brighteners, may be used in the treating bath in conventional amounts. Such auxiliaries must not, however, interfere with the proper functioning of the finishing resin, must not themselves have a deleterious effect on the fabric, and desirably are free of formaldehyde. The amount of treating agent which is applied to the fabric will depend upon the type of fabric and its intended application. In general it is about 0.5 to 10 percent, and preferably about 2 to 5 percent, based on the weight of the fabric. In the process of treating fabrics with the resins of this invention, the fabric is impregnated with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of the finishing resin, and the impregnated fabric is then dried and cured the drying and curing steps may be consecutive or simultaneous. If desired, the textile fabric may be finished by post curing also known as deferred or delayed curing . This consists of impregnating the fabric with a solution of the finishing resin and catalyst drying the impregnated material carefully so that the finishing agent does not react and then, after a prolonged interval, heating the material to a temperature at which the agent reacts under the influence of the catalyst. The condensates of this invention also are effective insolubilisers for the binders in paper coating compositions. Suitable binders used in the paper coating compositions include, unmodified starch, oxidised starch, enzyme converted starch starches having functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, amido, and amino groups proteins, such as casein latexes, such as styrene butadiene resin and their mixtures. The pigments may for example be clay with or without titanium dioxide and or calcium carbonate, and mixtures thereof. In addition to the binder, the pigment material and the insolubiliser described above, paper compositions may include conventional materials such as lubricants, defoamers, preservatives, coloured pigments, in conventional amounts. In the paper coating compositions described herein, the amount of binder is based upon the amount of pigment the ratio varies with the amount of bonding desired and with the adhesive characteristics of the particular binder employed. In general the amount of binder is about 4 to 25 percent, and preferably about 10 to 20 percent, based on the weight of the pigment. The amount of insolubiliser varies with the amount and properties of the binder and the amount of insolubilisation desired in general it is about 1 to 12 percent, and preferably about 4 to 8 percent, based on the weight of the binder, often 1 to 3 of the composition. The total solids content of the composition generally is within the range of about 50 to 70 percent, depending upon the method of application and the product requirements. The compositions of this invention can be applied to paper or paper like substrates by any known and convenient means. Although this invention will be described in relation to treating agents for textile fabrics and insolubilisers for binders in paper coating compositions, it is not intended to be limited thereto. The products of this invention can be used in other applications where glyoxal is commonly used, such as for example as a dry strength or a wet strength resin in paper a hand builder in textiles a binder in particleboard, medium density fibreboard, plywood, foundry and shell mouldings, insulation materials including glass fibre mats, friction materials, coated and bonded abrasives, etc., a component in moulding compounds an adhesive for wood and laminates a film forming resin in coatings and printing inks an additive in fibres, e.g., rayon an additive in rubber processing an agent in leather tanning a textile size a dry fixative for textiles an impregnant for filters, e.g., automotive filters. In order that the present invention may be more fully understood, the following examples are given by way of illustration. Examples 1 to 4 show the formation of pyrimidones while the other examples illustrate novel condensates and their uses. Unless otherwise specified, all parts and percentages are by weight.

The mixture was then heated for 4 hours at 70 C, forming a slightly hazy solution of an equilibrium mixture of 5,5 dimethylpyrimid 3 en 2 one and 5,5,dimethyl 4 hydroxy ethoxypyrimid 2 one, confirmed by IR spectra. 60 parts 1.0 mole of urea, 30 parts 1.0 mole of paraformaldehyde, 72 parts 1.0 mole of isobutyraldehyde, 92 parts 1.5 moles of ethylene glycol, 46 parts 2.6 moles of water, and 10 parts of 40 sulphuric acid were stirred together and heated at 70 C until a clear solution of an equilibrium mixture of 5,5 dimethylpyrimid 3 en 2 one and 5,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxy ethoxypyrimid 2 one was formed, confirmed by IR spectra. The product of Example 3 1.0 mole was reacted with 145 parts 1.0 mole of glyoxal to produce a condensate of glyoxal ethylene glycol 5,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyethoxy pyrimid 2 one and 5,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxypyrimid 2 one. The product of Example 4 was heated with 145 parts 1.0 mole of 40 glyoxal at 55 C for 2 hours to form an hydroxyethylated glyoxal pyrimidone condensate. The product of Example 1 was heated with 150 parts 1.08 moles of 40 glyoxal and 32 parts 0.4 mole of propylene glycol at 70 C for 4 hours to form propylene glycolated pyrimidone glyoxal condensate. The procedure of Example 7 was repeated using the pyrimidone solution of Example 2 instead of that of Example 1. A similar product was obtained. 140 parts 1.42 moles of 87 ethylene urea was reacted with 290 parts 2.0 moles of 40 glyoxal, 200 parts 1.89 moles of diethylene glycol, and 70 parts of water to form a clear yellow viscous solution of an ethylene urea glyoxal diethylene glycol condensate. The procedure of Example 9 was repeated except that the ratio of ethylene urea glyoxal diethylene glycol was 1 1.7 1.56 instead of 1 1.4 1.33. The procedure of Example 9 was repeated except that the ratio of ethylene urea glyoxal diethylene glycol was 1 2 1.89 instead of 1 1.4 1.33. The procedure of Example 9 was repeated with each of the following cyclic ureas instead of ethylene urea propylene urea, uron, tetrahydro 5 2 hydroxyethyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 one, and 4,5 dihydroxy 2 imidazolidinone. The results were comparable. The procedure of Example 9 was repeated with each of the following polyols instead of diethylene glycol ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, and glycerine. The results were comparable. Aqueous solutions containing 15.0 parts of the products of this invention, 3.75 parts of Catalyst 531 Sun Chemical Corporation s activated magnesium chloride catalyst , and 0.25 part of Sulfanole Wrinkle Recovery was measured by AATCC Test Method 66 1978 Wrinkle Recovery of Fabrics Recovery Angle Method . Tensile was measured by ASTM Test Method D 1682 64 Reapproved 1975 Tensile Grab CRT Pendulum Type . A paper coating composition was prepared by mixing 100 parts of 2 clay, 20 parts of starch Penford Gum 280, Penick Ford s hydroxyethylated starch , 1 part of calcium stearate, and 121 parts of water, and the resultant product was used in aliquots with various insolubilisers. The coating compositions were applied to 46 ream paper with a 8 Meyer applicator, using a draw down technique, cured at 105 C and then teated for viscosity and wet rub. Viscosity was measured with a Brookfield Viscometer. The results of the Adams Wet Rub test are reported as the weight in grams of coating removed from the substrate, the less the amount of solids removed, the better the degree of insolubilisation. From these data it can be seen that the product of this invention G is as effective a stabiliser as the conventional melamine formaldehyde at half the amount and does not contain or evolve free formaldehyde. To illustrate the superiority as an insolubiliser for a binder of a paper coating composition of a product of this invention over glyoxal, a coating composition was prepared as in Example 15. Propylene glycolated pyrimidone glyoxal at the 4 dry dry level against glyoxal at the 2 level were added to samples of the coating composition, and their viscosities and Adams Wet Rub test results were measured. The results were tabulated below. Wet rub values were slightly superior for the glyoxal, but the viscosities of the product of this invention were significantly lower than those of the glyoxal.
