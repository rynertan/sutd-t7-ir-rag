# GUIDE TROUGHS FOR MOLTEN PRODUCTS.

## Abstract
Guide troughs for leading molten products tapped from blast furnaces or electric furnaces or the like. A lengthy trough body 1 , formed in one block with monolithic refractories, is provided with hook engaging means in order for the body to be lifted and transported. The hook engaging means com prises supporting pipes 2 which are laid longitudinally in the upper portion of the body on both sides thereof supporting transverse members 3 which are disposed in an appropri ately spaced apart relationship to interconnect the supporting pipes on both sides of the trough body and cut out portions 4 provided in the trough body at suitable locations to expose the supporting pipes 2 to be engaged by hooks. The fact that the trough body has such stout supporting means and hook engaging means which does not project from the upper sur face of the trough body as the suspension plates in the con ventional guide trough of this type, allows the following advantages to be obtained. Namely, the hook engaging means is protected against radiant heat and splashing from high temperature molten products flowing through the trough. This greatly enhances safety during transportation. In addition, as there are no objects projecting from the upper surface of the trough body, the guide troughs can be stored by stacking. This permits a reduction in storage space.

## Claims
CLAIM A guide trough for molten products, comprising a long body made of monolithic refractory material and provided with a runway for conducting molten products in the top surface thereof a supporting means for supporting said body, having a couple of holding beams buried at both side upper corners of said body and extending longitudinally, said holding beams being connected with supporting cross members disposed at intervals and a hook engaging means provided by removing a part of said body and exposing the holding beams for engaging hook means.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONGUIDE TROUGH FOR MOLTEN PRODUCTS Field of the Invention This invention relates to improvements in guide troughs to be used for conducting molten products from a melting furnace, such as a blast furnace anu an electric furnace, and more particularly to a large size glide trough constructed in one block with monolithic refractory material. Background of the Invention In the recent tendency of the art, a long guide trough is constructed by stamping monolithic refractory material in one block instead of being constructed by brickworks, and transported and settled in the place where it is to be used.The method is also used for repairing the troughs, in which, when the inner surfaces of the troughs are worn by running molten products, whole of the trough is replaced with a new one instead of repairing by lining worn surfaces. Such troughs are so heavy some of them weigh about 1 ton or more that the outside of the refractory body is reinforced by a supporting member, such as plates or frame works, which are usually provided with hook plates projecting upwards and having hook engaging holes for hanging the trough body. As the hook plates are projecting upwards from the trough body, hook plates are exposed to the heat radiation and splashes of the hot running molten products while in use, and this may weaken the hook plates and cause damages.Further, piling up of the troughts in the storage is hindered by such projections. Summary of the Invention The guide trough of the present invention includes a long trough body m de of the monolithic refractory material and provided with a runway for conducting molten products in the top surface a supporting means for supporting saih trough body having a couple of holding beams buried at both side upper corners of said trough body and extending longitudinally, said holdinc beams being connected with supporting cross members disposed at intervals and a hook engaging means provided by removing a part of said trough body and exposing the holding beams for engaging hook means.Thus a strong and rigid sporting and hook engaging means may be provided, as well as the hook engaging mesas does not project out from the trough body, so that it is not exposed to the heat radiation nor splashes of hot running molten products and the damages thereof can be prevented absolutely. Also, the troughs may be piled up easily in the storage. The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Description of the Preferred Embodiment The trough shown in Fig.l Fig.3 includes a long body 1 formed by stamping monolithic refractory material and provided with a runway for conducting molten products in the top surface. The body 1 is reinforced by a couple of holding beams 2 of cylindrical form buried at both side upper corners and extending longitudinally. The holding beams 2 are connected by U shaped supporting cross members 3 disposed at intervals. Hook engaging means 4 are provided at suitable portions of the body 1 by removing a part of body 1 and exposing the holding beams 2 for engaging hook means. The trough may be hung by engaging the hook.6 of the hanging members 5 such as shown in Fig.4 with a portion of the holding beam 2 in the hook engaging means 4, and thus the trough can be transported. The h.oDk engaging means A are not projecting from the body 1 so that the troughs can be piled up easily in the storage. Further the hook engaging means 4 are not exposed to the heat radiation or splash of hot molten products runing through the runway of body 1, so that the damages of the hook engaging means can be prevented. Pipings, flat or angle bars may be used for the holding beams 2. Also connecting members 7 may be used for connecting and securing supporting cross members 3 at the bottom of the body 1 as shown in Fig.3. Fig.5 Fig.7 shows a trough of another embodiment of the present invention, in which two flat bars 8 and 8 are used as a holding beam 2 . Flat bars 8 and 8 are piled up together with a reinforcing member such as wire nettings 3 therebetween which is lined inside of the supporting cross members 3. Wire nettings 3 are secured to the flat bars 8 and 8 with bolts 9, and supporting cross members 3 are welded to the outside bar 8.
