# HIGH PERFORMANCE CATALYSTS FOR CARBO METALLIC OIL CONVERSION AS WELL AS THEIR MANUFACTURE AND USE

## Abstract
A catalyst nominally containing zeolite, clay and silica alumina gel. The zeolite is preferably partially exchanged with high La Ce ratio solution in a wetting step. The catalyst and processes for its manufacture and use are disclosed. The catalyst is excellent for processing heavy oils, generally pro duces higher LCO slurry oil ratio and has high metals toler ance.
