## Description
INSULATED WIRES AND ELECTRIC CABLES This invention relates to insulated wires and electric cables, all of which are hereinafter included in the term cables . The cables of the invention are primarily, but not exclusively, suitable for aircraft wiring and other electronics purposes. One of the more successful cables at present used in this market is the Applicants KPA150 cable. In this cable two tapes of aromatic polyimide foil, each thinly coated on both sides with fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer as a bonding agent, are lapped on the conductor each overlapping by 67 nominally so that each tape forms three complete overlapping layers, and a pigmented lacquer is applied to give an abrasion resistant coating that is receptive to printing. This cable is suitable for continuous service at 150 0C, and is generally satisfactory, though the slightly irregular surface has occasionally caused difficulties in sealing round the cable at terminations and may reduce the legibility of markings, and the fluorine and nitrogen contents may imply some toxic hazard under severe fire conditions. The present invention provides a cable which i has at least as good temperature rating ii has a smooth surface iii contains no, or at least substantially less, fluorine and substantially less nitrogen iv is easier to manufacture and requires simpler plant and v can be at least as low in weight and bulk at the KP 150 cable an important consideration as the weight of cables in a modern aircraft can be a significant fraction of the payload . The cable in accordance with the invention comprises at least one metallic conductor a single layer of an aromatic polyimide tape applied to the conductor with an overlap and an extruded outer layer based on a polymer consisting of chains of aromatic rings linked by groups selected from 0 , S , and CO , and CR2 where RH or alkyl or acyl . If it is desired to bond the layers of tape, the conventional type of tape coated with a bonding layer of fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer can be used, but this is not essential and the use of uncoated tape has the advantage of completely eliminating fluorine compounds from the cable. Preferably the tape is helically applied to the conductor, preferably with an overlap of at least 60 .Alternatively, however, the tape could be applied longitudinally or as a further alternative could be applied initially in a longitudinal direction and converted to a helical form by twisting the wrapped wire before or after applying the outer layer for example using a flyer type winding machine as conventionally used for twinning and bunching . The conductor may be solid or stranded and is preferably of plain, tinned, nickel plated or silverplated copper. The preferred polyimide for the tape is that sold under the trademark Kapton, which is believed to consist essentially of the polymeric pyromellitate of p,p diamino diphenyl ether. Preferably the tape is no more than o,04mm thick and any coating thereon no more than 0.005mm thick.More especially Kapton 010 tape, an uncoated tape O.025mm thick and Kapton 616 tape, a coated tape in which the polyimide is about 0.025mm thick and the coating about 0.0025mm thick, are preferred. Suitable polymers for the outer layer are described in British Patent Specifications 971,227, 1,016,245, 1,019,266, 1,019,458, 1,078,234, 1,086,021, 1,102,679, 1,153,035, 1,153,527, 1,164,817, 1,177,183, 1,383,393, 1,387,303, and 1,414,421, 1,414,422 and 1,414,423 and in European Patent Application 0001879.Linear polymers are usually preferred, but some can be crosslinked, and this may sometimes be beneficial. Polymers in which the aromatic groups are predominately phenylene and the linking groups are selected from 0 , CO and 502 are preferred most preferred are polyether ketones and polyether sulphones in which in both cases 0 linkages are in the majority, and more especially paraphenylene polyether ketones having about twice as many 0 linkages as CO linkages such as the polymer sold by ICI E as PEEK . The outer layer is preferably extruded, either as a single operation or in two or more steps. Alternatively it might be in tape form applied helically or applied longitudinally with or without subsequent twisting further it might be a composite layer applied partly in tape form and partly by extrusion under, over or between tapes .When the outer layer is in two or more parts they may be of identical composition or they may differ within the range of polymers defined above. Preferably the outer layer is oriented, suitable techiniques for extruded layers being described in ourBritish Patent Application 16614 78 and our EuropeanApplication No. 79301544.7. Two or more wires, insulated as described, may be assembled together by twisting or otherwise to form a multi conductor cable, with or without a suitable overall sheath, braid or other coverings. Preferably the combined radial thickness of the polyimide tape layer and the outer layer is not more than 0.25mm. The following examples illustrate typical forms of the invention.Example 1 A single conductor low toxicity airframe cable consists of a conventionally stranded conductor made up of 19 silver plated annealed copper conductors each 0.20 mm in diameter lapped with a single tape of FEP coated polyimide tape Kapton 616up , 9.6 mm wide and applied with 67 overlap nominal diameter over tape 1.18 mm , heatsealed and then covered with 0.15 mm radial thickness of a polyphenylene ether ketone having about two ether linkages for each ketone linkage . This covering is applied by extrusion using a conventional thermoplastic extrude operating at 4000C, and raises the nominal overall diameter to 1.48 mm. The polyphenylene ether ketone can be coloured with suitably chosen pigments, if desired other additives are unnecessary. Examples 2 and 3 Two and three respectively of the conductors described in Example 1 are twisted together with a laylength of 20 times pitch diameter, right handed.Example 4 A braided 2 core aircraft wiring cable consists of the cable of Example 2 braided with 0.10 mm diameter silver plated annealed copper wires, 16 spindles 8 ends, 19 mm lay nominal diameter over braid 3.46 mm and sheathed to a radial thickness of 1.0 mm with an ethylene acrylic polymer composition formulated as follows Parts by weightVamac N 123 masterbatch 47.50 believed to consist of about 80 of a terpolymer of ethylene, methyl acrylate and Åa carboxylic monomer together wth about 20 of an inert silica filler Parts by weightHydrated alumina, 44.63 Paper grade SD particle size around 1 micrometre Silica filler Vulcasil S 1.91Process Aids Stearic acid 0.80 Another fatty acid sold as Armeen 18D 0.20Antioxidant Santowhite powder 0.76Solid formulation of vinyl trimethoxy silane Drimix silane A172 o.60Curing system Peroxide 40 active 2.70 Perkadox 14 40 Triallyl cyanurate 75 active on O.go powder carrier Drimix 75 TAC 100.00Example 5 The single core of Example 1 is braided and sheathed substantially as described in Example 3. Example 6 10 These are identical with Examples 1 5 respectively except that the polyimide tape is uncoated Kapton 010 tape and not heat sealed.Example 11 A thirty core cable comprises conductors according to Example 6 laid up 4, 10 and 16 with the lay length of each layer 20 times the respective pitch diameter, with a sheath 1.2 mm radial thickness of the same formulation set out in Example 4.Example 12 This is similar to Example 11, but each core is the screened and sheathed conductor of Example 10. The cables of the Examples all have excellent radiation and water resistance those of Examples 1 5 have good resistance to notch propagation, whereas the others have the merit of a substantially zero halogen content.
