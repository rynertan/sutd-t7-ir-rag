## Description
Building comprising a plurality of similar basic building elements interconnected on the building site The invention relates to a building comprising a plurality of similar basic building elements interconnected on the building site. In the building industry, particularly in developing countries, there is a need for a building system which permits of rapidly erecting houses and the like on a building site with a minimum of labour. Particularly in developing countries professional knowledge on the building site is limited and it is, therefore, preferred to use as far as possible prefabricated elements. However, the building system to be employed has to be such that a high degree of flexibility of design is ensured. The invention has for its object to provide a building system which allows a great variety in design and in which nevertheless basic subassemblies are employed. According to the invention this is achieved in that the basic building elements are individually self supporting and are shaped in the form of a cubic frame of steel beams. The beams of the frame may be interconnected by screw joints. Moreover, the basic elements can be interconnected by screw joints. On the building site it is sufficient to erect the frame by interconnecting the beams by means of screw bolt joints, which operation can be carried out by unskilled labour. The frame is anchored to the foundation for example, by anchoring bolts embedded in the foundation, which pass into bores in the frame beams so that they can be fixed ably means of nuts.The resultant frame structure satisfies alt requirements of conventional building technology i.e. supporting function and storm resistance. On both sides of the horizontal or vertical beams on the outer side walls can be erected, a cavity being left between said walls. The wall preferably consists of prefabricated elements, which are preferably fastened to said beams.These elements may be made of synthetic material or another suitable material. The invention provides the possibility of attaching the wall elements to the beams with the aid of strips damping the contact noise on the contact places with the elements. For the floor and the roof there may be used prefabricated elements. The partitions may also be built from prefabricated elements. Conduits for heating, electricity and water may be disposed above the ceilings or beneath the floor. As an alternative they may be arranged vertically or horizontally through the cavities of the walls. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawing of an embodiment. In the drawing Figure 1 is a schematic plan of a building in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a perspective view of a building erected from basic elements embodying the invention, Figure 3 is a perspective view of the building ofFigure 2 in the finished state, Figure 4 is a perspective view of a corner of a basic element in accordance with the invention, and Figure 5 illustrates a corner of a basic element in accordance with the invention at the fastening area on the foundation. The building comprises a plurality of similar basic elements consisting each of a cubic steel beam frame. Each frame comprises a base of four beams 1, 2, 3 and 4, four vertical posts, 5, 6, 7 and 8, and an upper or roof part consisting of four beams 9, 10, 11 and 12. At the corners the beams are interconnected by means of bolt and nut joints. To this end, for example, the vertical post 6 Figure 4 may have a flange 13. Each frame is anchored by means of bolt and nut joints see Figure 5 to the foundation 14. The bolts may be embedded, for example, in the concrete of the foundation. By differently combining the basic elements the desired design can be obtained. The vertical posts 6, for example, may coincide with a partition. Further the partitions may be arranged detachedly. After the erection of the skeleton the building is completed by operating from top to bottom. It is preferred to first mount the roof, which provides the possibility of con tinuing work even in rainy weather so that during the entire building operations the influence of wind, water and so on on the building work is minimized. Since the skeleton is self supporting, such a building process is practicable. Subsequently the outer walls of standard elements of different types can be erected. It is also possible to build up the outer walls in a conventional way from bricks, light weight concrete elements, concrete elements or wood and the like. The floor may also be made from standard elements, but as an alternative normal girders with floor slabs may be used to this end. It will be obvious that a building according to the invention does not require skilled labour on the building site. The mounting operations are simple enough to be carried out by unskilled labour. The inner and outer walls finally hide the steel frame from sight so that esthetically the building according to the invention is not inferior to a traditional building.
