# Nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic apparatus which forms an image of a slice of an object is described. The ap paratus includes a circuit for detecting NMR signals induced from an object, having a resonance circuit formed by a re ceiving coil 31 which surrounds the object and a capacitor 32 , peak hold means 39 for receiving the NMR signals generated from the resonance circuit 31, 32 to retain the maximum value of the NMR signals in an excitation cycle of the sprins of the excited nuclei, and a synchronism device 42 for controlling the selection of the NMR signals in response to the value held by the peak hold means being with a predetermined range of levels. The variation of the NMR signal level in ac cordance with the variation of floating capacitance of the reso nance circuit, which alters according to the motion of the ob ject, is thus used to detect the state of the objects movement and the NMR signals selected in a predetermined state of motion.
