# HEADER CONNECTOR AND ATTACHMENT

## Abstract
A header connector and attachment for a flexible printed circuit 10 having a plurality of exposed end segments 18 in cludes a connector 24 with an integral outrigger 42 44 par allel thereto and separated therefrom by an open span 50 52 , a plurality of male pin terminals 78 each with a long leg 80 wedged into a bore 34 in the connector and a short leg 82 disposed at 90 to the long leg and extending between the con nector and the outrigger, evenly spaced slots 62 in a lower surface 56 of the outrigger receiving distal ends 84 of the short legs, whereby the latter are aligned in parallel relation, a pair of projections 54, 58 at opposite ends of the outrigger received in a corresponding pair of apertures 86, 88 in the printed circuit, whereby the connector is located relative to the printed circuit with each of the short legs disposed over and parallel to a corresponding one of the circuit end segments, and a plurality of splice clips 90 each with integral tabs 94 projecting through the printed circuit and wrapped around respective ones of the short legs, whereby the printed circuit is forced against the short legs with the circuit end segments captured therebetween.
