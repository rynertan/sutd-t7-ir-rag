# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DATA TRANSMISSION USING CHIRPED FREQUENCY SHIFT KEYING MODULATION

## Abstract
A method for transmission of digital data utilizes a carrier frequency offset in a first frequency direction for a first binary condition, and offset in a second frequency direction for the remaining binary condition, at the start of a bit time interval. The carrier frequency is swept in a preselected frequency direction during each bit time interval, to produce a chirped frequency shift keyed waveform in the frequency domain, for transmission of each bit of binary data. Frequency shift keyed demodulation is utilized at a receiving end, with the receiver synchronized to the transmit ter bit time interval, to recover the transmitted digital data. Apparatus for data transmission using this chirped frequen cy shift keyed modulation waveform is disclosed.
