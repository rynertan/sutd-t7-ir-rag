## Description
Glycerol Detection Reagent and its Use The invention relates to an improved glycerol detection reagent. In many fields, it is important to determine triglyceride concentration of a substance. This is particularly important in clinical biochemistry. The determination of triglyceride concentration in human serum is an important part of a routine lipid analysis in clinical chemistry. There are numerous prior art methods and compositions for measuring triglycerides concentration.One class of methods includes transforming the triglycerides into glycerol and then measuring the glycerol content. Generally, a glycerol detection reagent is known in which the glycerol is phosphorylated with adenosine triphosphate in the presence of glycerol kinase to give glycerol l phosphate and adenosine diphosphate. The adenosine diphosphate is then converted by phosphoenol pyruvate in the presence of pyruvate kinase into pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate. The pyruvate formed is hydrogenated by nicotinamide adenine dinuclos tide in the reduced form in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase to obtain lactate while the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is oxidized to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The amount of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide utilized by the reaction is equivalent to the amount of glycerol and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide can easily be determined quantitatively on the basis of its absorption at 366, 340, or 344 nm. Generally, a glycerol detection reagent can result in errors due to endogenous enzymes, endogenous substrates, and turbidity. The instant invention overcomes these errors and also provides an extremely fast measurement. This last advantage is particularly important in connection with a fast acting formulation which will hydrolize the triglycerides to glycerol rapidly. Such a fast acting formulation is disclosed in the concurrently filed patent application having the same applicants and assignee as the instant application corresponding to USSN 171,065 . In its broader scope, the invention features a glycerol detection reagent consisting essentially of glycerol kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, adenosine triphosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate, nicoti namide adenine dinucleotide reduced form , bovine serum albumen, magnesium sulphate, and a buffer the ratio of the pyruvate kinase to lactate dehydrogenase is about 1 1 the ratio of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase each to glycerol kinase is about 2 1 the magnesium ions are present in the range from about 3.1 to about 6.0 mM and the pH of the reagent is in the range of from about 6.9 to about 7.6. Preferably, the glycerol kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase are lyophilized and the bovine serum albumen is crystallized and lyophilized. Preferably, the buffer is in the form of phosphates such as potassium phosphate, monobasic and potassium phosphate, dibasic. Illustrative non limiting examples of the practice of the invention are set out below. Numerous other examples can readily be evolved in the light of the guiding principles and teachings contained herein.The examples given herein are intended merely to illustrate the invention and not in any sense to limit the manner in which the invention can be practiced.Example 1 Example l was carried out to show that a glycerol detection system according to the invention could obtain an accurate determination rapidly. The aforementioned concurrently filed patent corresponding to USSN 171,065 application discloses the use of at least one bacterial lipase derived from a bacterial source in the group consisting of Pseudomonas species and Chromobacterium species. These lipases above or in combination with each other have been found to hydrolize triglycerides rapidly and completely to an endpoint in less than 4 minutes. The preferable lipase are from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Chromobacterium viscosum as well as a combination of these lipases. The Example l used a lipase ratio of Pseudomonas fluorescens to Chromobacterium viscosum of about 90 10 in the amount of 100 lipase units per mL of the composition. As used herein, one lipase unit is defined as the amount which will release one micromole of fatty acid per minute from emulsified olive oil at 220C and pH 7.5 in a reaction mixture as follows 0.4 M sodium chloride 6 millimolar magnesium sulphate.7H20 5 millimolar calcium chloride 2H20 0.67 mg bovine serum albumen per milliliter of the reaction mixture 137 mg olive oil in suspension per milliliter of the reaction mixture The glycerol detection reagent for the best mode was formulated as follows a. All of the components for the reagent were preweighed prior to formulation and stored dessicated at appropriate temperatures. b. A potassium phosphate buffer was prepared and the pH of the buffer was adjusted to be about 7.5 at room temperature. c. Bovine serum albumen crystallized, lyophilized was added to t he buffer. d.

The following parameters were determined The ratio of the enzymes glycerol kinaSe pyruvate kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase was found to be critical. The ratio of pyruvate kinase to lactic dehydrogenase should be about l land the ratio of glycerol kinase to either of the other enzymes should be about 1 2. Changes in these ratios affect linearity and sensitivity. A reduction in overall concentration will eventually reduce overall reaction rate. For NADH, the initial absorbance reading at 340 nm determines the linearity0 Freshly prepared composition has a theoretical absorbance value 340 nm of 1.8, due to NADH. An absorbance value at 340 nm of 1.0 provides good linearity for triglycerides concentrations up to at least 1000 mg per dL serum. Phosphate was selected as the buffer to minimize interference from serum containing phosphatas es. High levels of the phosphate buffer can tend to inhibit the glycerol detection reagent or produce a magnesium phosphate precipitation. Low levels can be insufficient to provide buffering. Other buffers can be used satisfactorily in accordance with prior art practice such as triethanolamine and HEPES f 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid . Magnesium sulphate in the range of from about 3.1 mM to about 6.0mM has been tested. The higher levels tended to result in a precipitation in the pre sence of NH4 . A pH range of from about 6.9 to about 7.6 has been found acceptable within the constraint on the buffer given above. NADH stability tends to decrease for a pH below about 7. Preferably, the glycerol de tection reagent should have a pH in the range of from about 7.5 to about 7.6. Generally, any glycerol detection reagent for use with a spectrophotometer should take into account turbidity which does not change during the course of the reaction endogenous substrates in sera such as glycerol and pyruvate and endogenous enzymes in sera such as phosphatases which break down reagent components such as adensine triphosphate to adenosine diphosphate and phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate. The instant glycerol detection reagent showed the following advantageous properties Turbidity Static In accordance with conventional practice, absor bance calculations are made from the difference in absorbance so that static turbidity effects are cancelled out. Endogenous Substrates Endogenous substrates react sunstantially with the instant glycerol detection reagent within the first 15 seconds before the initial absorbance measurement. Endogenous EnzymesEndogenous enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase up to about 1000 IU. of human serum alkaline phosphatase are not reactive with the instant glycerol detection reagent and thus, do not interface with the measurements of triglycerides in sera. Example 3 Example 3 was carried out to show that the instant glycerol detection reagent is fast. For this purpose, solutions of glycerol were prepared to correspond to triglycerides concentrations as follows 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg triglycerides per dL of serum. These solutions were based on the assumption that 1 mg of glycerol is equivalent to 9.578 mg triglycerides The glycerol detection reagent of the Example 1 was reacted with each solution and the CentrifiChem 400System was used. Each reaction was at least about 90 completed within 15 seconds. We wish it to be understood that we do not desire to be limited to the exact details described, for obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art.
