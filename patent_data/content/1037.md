# Craze resistant polysiloxane coating compositions containing a discontinuous phase substrates coated therewith process of producing the coatings on the substrates.

## Abstract
Polysiloxane resin coatings containing a dispersed phase of particulate organic modifier which is tougher than the polysiloxane and which has an adequately high coefficient of friction have improved craze resistance permitting the use of thicker coatings with greater durability.
