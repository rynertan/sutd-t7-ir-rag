# METHOD FOR HANDLING A COAL WATER SUSPENSION AND STIRRING TANK FOR WORKING THE METHOD

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for handling a coal water suspension to be stored in a tank 10 connected to a burner 12 , and to be supplied to the burner for combustion therein. In order to avoid the necessity of storing the coal water suspension in the tank under continuous stirring, said suspen sion is stored in a heavy condition in the tank. Then, a defined volume of the coal water suspension is being stirred and after dilution with water is supplied in a more fluid, well suspended homogenized condition to the burner for combustion. The invention also relates to a stirring tank 13 for receiv ing the defined volume while stirring said volume.
