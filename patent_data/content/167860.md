# Transaction processing system.

## Abstract
A transaction processing system comprises an electro nic cash register machine ECR and a balance settling machine. The ECR includes a keyboard from which the figures for individual items in one transaction are entered, and a memory in which the cumulative records of the figures are stored. An actual amount of money temporarily paid by a customer for the purchased items is also entered from the keyboard. A balance data representing an outstanding balance of money to be returned to the customer is calculated in the ECR. A recording medium on which the appropriate identification ID code is recorded is handed to the customer. The cash transaction data and the appropriate balance data together with the customer s ID code are sent to the balance settling machine. When the customer inserts his or her recording medium into the balance settling machine, the ID code on the recording medium is read. The transaction date received from the ECR and corresponding to the ID code read is printed out and a receipt slip is issued. The balance of money equivalent to the appropriate balance data is delivered from the balance settling machine.
