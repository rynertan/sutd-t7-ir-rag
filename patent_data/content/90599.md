# Cryogenic device and method.

## Abstract
The temperature of a biological specimen or other object may be controlled by supporting the object within a vessel 12 containing a liquid cryogen C above the liquid cryogen level L and varying the vertical spacing between the object and the liquid cryogen level L . The vessel 12 is provided with vertically continuous inner walls 12.3 of high thermal con ductivity, e.g., metal walls, to provide a vertical temperature gradient within the vessel 12 above the liquid cryogen level L .
