# Method for Correcting Time Base Fluctuations in a Reproduced Video Signal.

## Abstract
Whenever component signals color difference signals of a video tape recorder signal are recorded in a recording medium in accordance with timeplex time division multi plex method, velocity error inevitably occurs because there always exists a difference in relative velocity between a tape head and tape between recording process and reproducing process. To perfectly eliminate the velocity errors included in the component signals when reading out the signals, a first read clock signal RCKR is generated to read a first component signal recorded in the first half of each horizontal period segment under consideration of integral velocity error as in the conventional method, but a second read clock signal RCKB is generated to read a second component signal recorded in the second half of each horizontal period segment under consideration of both initial offset velocity error and integral velocity error.
