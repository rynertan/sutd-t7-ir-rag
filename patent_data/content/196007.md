# Desmosine derivatives and reagent for preparing artificial antigens.

## Abstract
A novel desmosine derivative, which is useful for prepar ing a desmosine artificial antigen, has an activated, disulfide bond on the side chain at 3 or 5 position of the pyridinium ring. The derivative can combine with a polymer having thiel groups by a disulfide bond to form the effective artificial antigen.
