# Vehicle barrier.

## Abstract
A vehicle barrier to be mounted in streets or roads for blocking part of the width of the carriageway comprises a gate mounted to swing about a post 10 by means of a socket 13 slipped over the post with its lower end rotatably supported on a collar 12 secured to the post, and a frame 15 which projects transversely from the socket by means of a lock 16 on the gate the latter being able to be locked against rotation in at least one angular position. Two stops 18 on the post limit the swinging movement of the gate.

## Description
The invention relates to a vehicle barrier to be mounted in streets and on roads for blocking part of the width of the drive way. Such barriers are used where it is desired to prevent unauthorized motor cars from entering. It may be a question of locking out from a street in a housing area or a residential district other cars than those belonging to people living in the area or district, or a question of excluding all traffic from a specific road or street but still maintaining the possibility of driving road machines, garbage trucks, emergency vehicles and similar vehicles into the road or street, when necessary, to mention only a few examples of the use of such a vehicle barrier. The object of the invention is to provide a vehicle barrier of the kind referred to which is simple and can be easily manufactured but nevertheless is of a sturdy construction and can be incorporated into different surroundings without disturbing the environment said vehicle barrier being easily mounted on the spot because it requires a minimum of ground work, and also being very easily operated, because the movable part thereof is of a light structure. To achieve said object a vehicle barrier of the kind referred to above is characterized in that a gate comprising a bearing socket and a frame projecting transversally from the bearing socket, is pivotally mounted at the bearing socket on a pole to be anchored in the ground, and that means are provided for locking the gate against rotational movement on the pole in at least one angular position. In order to illustrate the invention two embodiments of the vehicle barrier will be described in more detail below reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a view showing one embodiment of the vehicle barrier according to the invention mounted for closing off a street in a residential district to motor traffic FIG. 2 is a side view of the embodiment of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a plan view of the embodiment of FIG. 1 FIG. 4 is a view corresponding to that of FIG. 2 of a second embodiment of the vehicle barrier and FIG. 5 is a view corresponding to that of FIG. 3 of said second embodiment of the vehicle barrier. The vehicle barrier according to FIGS. 1 to 3 is made entirely of tubes and flats, preferably of hotdip galvanized quality. The barrier comprises a tubular pole 10 which is cast integral with a concrete lump 11 in the ground and is anchored therein at its lower end. A ring 12 is secured by welding to the pole substantially at the centre of the portion of the pole projecting from the ground surface, and a bearing socket 13 is slipped onto the portion of the pole which extends upwardly from the ring, the upper end of the bearing socket being closed by a circular blank 14 secured to said end by welding. A tubular U formed frame 15 having web and limbs perpendicular to each other, projects from the bearing socket the ends of the limbs being secured by welding to the bearing socket.In the embodiments disclosed herein the frame has limbs the length of which is substantially greater than that of the web. In FIG. 1 the web is straight the corners between the web and the limbs being smoothly curved, but the web of the frame can also form a semi circular bend between the two limbs as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4.Frames of other forms are conceivable within the scope of the invention, and it is of course also possible to provide the frame with one or more struts in the opening defined by the frame The gate formed by the frame and the bearing socket thus is pivoted on the pole for rotation about a vertical axis, and in order to facilitate the rotation and to eliminate the need of lubrication a nylon washer can be provided between the lower end of the bearing socket and the ring, which takes up the axial load caused by the weight of the gate, while nylon bushings can be provided at the top and bottom of the bearing socket between the socket and the pole. The gate 13, 15 can be locked in the closed position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 said position being shown by solid lines also in FIG. 3, by means of a lock 16 which is mounted on a plate 17 secured by welding to the corner between the frame and the bearing socket at the lower side of the lower limb of the frame. A stop 18 projecting radially from the pole 10 is secured by welding to the pole below the ring 12 said stop arresting the gate in the closed position thereof. The stop forms a hole or recess for engagement with a lock bolt forming part the lock, which is operated by means of a key the key hole is indicated at 19. Preferably the lock and the bolt thereof are of the construction wherein the lock is automatically engaged with the abutment formed by the stop, when the gate is rotated to the closed position thereof engaging the stop. As will be seen from FIG. 1 the gate is directed perpendicularly into the drive way from one side thereof when the gate is in the closed position the free end of the gate being positioned at such a short distance from a fence 20 or the like which extends over a distance into the drive way from the other side thereof, that the passage remaining between the fence and the gate is too narrow for a vehicle to pass through it. However, said passage is sufficiently wide for pedestrians and cyclists to pass and also for e.g.a perambulator to be pushed unobstructedly through the passage. A suitable width of this passage when the gate is closed is 1P5 m. When the gate 13, 15 has been disengaged by unlocking the gate at the lock 16 it can be rotated on the pole to open position the position indicated by dot and dash lines in FIG. 3 which forms an angle of 900 to the closed position. This open position can be defined by a stop 21 which is secured to the pole by welding and co operates with the plate 17. If it is assumed that the gate has a total length of 1 or 2 m there is provided by rotating the gate to open position a sufficiently large passage for a relatively large vehicle to pass easily. When the vehicle has passed the gate is rotated to the closed position and then locked again automatically The embodiment of FIGS. 4 and 5 differs from the embodiment described above only by the gate being double, i.e. it has a further tube frames5 which is secured to the bearing socket 13 by welding at the side diametrically opposite to the frame 15. Thus, it is possible to lock out unauthorized traffic from relatively wide drive ways by means of this gate when the gate is in the closed and locked position thereof.The pole is located at the centre of the drive way, and when the gate is opened the position indicated by dot and dash lines in FIG. 5 two passages are opened, one on each side of the pole, e.q. for two traffic lanes in opposite directions.
