# DOUBLE EYE CRIME PREVENTION SENSOR SYSTEM.

## Abstract
A double eye crime prevention sensor system has a first pair of detection shafts 6 set so as to extend in substantially the same direction horizontally some distance apart within a predetermined space, and a second pair of detection shafts 7 each set so as to extend substantially in the same direction as each of the first shafts 6 some distance above or below the first shafts 6 . An energy focusing element 4 for focusing the radiation energy incident along the shafts is disposed at the end of the two pairs of detection shafts, two pairs of radiation energy sensing elements 8 and 9 disposed at the focus positions corresponding to the two pairs of detection shafts in the vicinity of the focus of the focusing element in such a manner that two elements 8a , 8b or 9a , 9b forming the elements 8 or 9 are each connected to produce a substantially composite sensing output when radiation energy is detected with a time lag, and a signal processor is provided for generating an alarm when the two composite sensing outputs from the sensor ele ments coincide in the element array direction to produce the energy detecting time lag of the two composite sensing outputs from the sensor elements.
