# Control circuit and process for digital storage devices.

## Abstract
A circuit and process for controlling access to a digital storage device 12 is disclosed. The process involves reading a control word from a control store 40 and using an address register predictor 54 for partially decoding an address field of the control word to predict the storage location to be acces sed. The address field is subsequently fully decoded in a decoder 46 to determine the actual storage location to be accessed. Prior to completion of this full decoding step, an access to the predicted location in main storage 12 is initi ated. In the event the actual storage location to be accessed differs from the predicted one, the memory access previously initiated is overriden and an access to the actual storage location is initiated.
