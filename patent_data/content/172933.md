# Fluorescent X ray analyzing method of solution specimen.

## Abstract
For analyzing the solution specimen according to the fluorescent X ray analyzing method, a certain quantity of solution specimen to be analyzed 3 is impregnated into a thin porous sheet, for example by dripping method 5 , and the sheet is dried 8 for evaporating the solvent. Held on an appropriate holder 7 the sheet is placed in a vacuum atmosphere or an atmosphere of helium gas, so that the primary X rays are irradiated and the wavelength or the intensity of the fluorescent X rays generated from the solute remained in the sheet may be detected 9 . The concentra tion of the solution may be changed by concentrating 3 or by diluting 4 , so that an adequate intensity of the fluores cent X ray may be generated. A specimen sampler for use in said method is made of porous sheet material, to which the solution specimen to be analyzed is impregnated and dried to retain only the solute of the solution in the sheet. To the circumferential edge of the sheet is attached a cir cular edge of a support, so that the central portion of the porous sheet is sufficiently spaced from the circumferenti ally provided support.
