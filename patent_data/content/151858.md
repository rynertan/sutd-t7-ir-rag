# Magnetically synchronized clutch apparatus.

## Abstract
Magnetically synchronized clutch apparatus 20 in cludes a jaw clutch 22 and an electromagnetic synchronizer 44 . The jaw clutch has a rotatable sleeve member 24 and a rotatable shift assembly 28 with a shift member 32 . A spring 36 biases the shift member 32 for engagement with the sleeve member 24 . The shift assembly 28 is slidable to a position in which the members remain disengaged when not rotating in approximate synchronism. The electromagne tic synchronizer 44 brings the members into approximate synchronism upon sliding of the shift assembly 28 .
