# BALL BEARING FOR LINEARLY MOVING PARTS.

## Abstract
A ball bearing for linearly moving parts, which is used to guide a linerly moving part, such as a table in a machining tool or a positioning table. In this ball bearing, a ball circulated passage is formed by fitting in a laminated state in a leg portion 3a of a bearing body 3 , in which load ball grooves 3b, 3b are provided, an intermediate member 2 having upper and lower J shaped grooves 2a , which are opposed to upper and lower members 1, 1 provided with opposed J shaped grooves 1a , and upper and lower grooves 2a connecting the ends of the upper and lower J shaped grooves 2a , to thereby facilitate the manufactur ing of the bearing and reduce the number of parts thereof.
