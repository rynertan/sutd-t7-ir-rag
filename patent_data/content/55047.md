# IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERHEAD ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES

## Abstract
In an overhead electric transmission line, risk of fracture of a sound insulator string arising from fracture of another insu lator string supporting conductors at a pylon is reduced by ar ranging for a link 5, 15 interconnecting the insulator strings 3 to carry energy dissipating members 7, 17 which dissipate the en ergy arising from fracture of one of the strings. As the sound insulator string moves transversely to a position in which it is co linear with a single position of suspension of the strings from a cross arm 2, the links 5, 15 are caused to prvot and the parts of the members 7, 17 extending between the pivotal axes 6, 16 and the ends of the members nearer restraining stops 8, 18 are gradually and smoothly distorted to an arcuate shape so that the additional load to which the sound insulator string is subjected gradually and smoothly increases from zero to a va lue such that the resultant load on the sound insulator string does not exceed the maximum safe working load of the string.
