# POWER SWITCHING CIRCUIT FOR A PULSED LASER

## Abstract
A power switching circuit for providing variable pulse width drive signals for a laser in response to pulsed control signals. The power switching circuit includes a ferroresonant transformer circuit 300 and a power transistor output circuit 322, 324, 326 . The ferroresonant transformer circuit 300 comprises a first pair of primary windings 302, 304 coupled to input terminals 301, 303 through a switch 306 and an associated pair of secondary windings 312, 314 coupled to the output circuit 322, 324, 326 to apply switching signals thereto. The transformer circuit 300 further includes a sec ond pair of primary windings 308, 310 coupled through a resistor to the input terminals 301, 303 with a polarity op posite that of the first pair. The transistor output circuit 322, 324, 326 includes three power transistors 330 arranged in parallel with their bases coupled to the transformer circuit secondary windings 312, 314 and their collectors coupled to the laser tube cathode.
