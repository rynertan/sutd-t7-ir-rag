# Elastomeric electro conductive devices.

## Abstract
An elastomeric electro conductive device 10 comprises a silicone polymer non conductive substrate 11 carrying an elastomeric electro conductive member 12 formed from silicone polymer loaded with graphite carbon particles. Conductor means 14A,14B enable connection of the device 10 to an electrical network and comprise lengths 15 of conductive silicone rubber adhesively secured at one end to member 12 by a body 18 of elastomeric bonding material. the body 18 and the member 12 have the same electrical characteristics and may have identical constituents and formulations.
