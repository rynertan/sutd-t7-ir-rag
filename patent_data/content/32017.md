# Bootstrap circuit.

## Abstract
A bootstrap circuit in which a load MOS transistor Q₈ and a drive MOS transistor Q₁₀ are connected in series be tween a high potential source Vcc and a low potential source Vss to form an inverter a capacitor Q₉ is connected to an output terminal N₅ of the inverter, and a circuit Ø₁, Q₆ for charging and a circuit for discharging the capacitor Q₉ are provided, the circuit for discharging the capacitor Q₉ being connected between the capacitor Q₉ and the low potential source Vss and containing a M0S transistor Q₁ , which is rendered conductive upon receipt of a reset signal ø₂ . The feature of the present application resides in the fact that another MOS transistor Q ₇ of which the gate may be con nected to the high potential source Vcc is inserted in series with the MOS transistor Q₇ in the discharge circuit. The second MOS transistor Q ₇ shares the high voltage which would otherwise exist across the first MOS transistor Q₇ just before the resetting operation, This reduces varia tions in the threshold voltage of the first MOS transistor Q₇ , and avoids the danger of it breaking down,
