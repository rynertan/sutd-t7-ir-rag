# Fast breeder reactor.

## Abstract
A fast breeder reactor has a nuclear reactor container 11 filled with a liquid metal, a reactor core 15 disposed within the nuclear reactor container 11 , and a first support ing structural member 32 which is mounted to the nuclear reactor container 11 such as to support the reactor core 15 . The fast breeder reactor is provided with a cylindrical structural member 21 which surrounds the periphery 24 of the reactor core 15 such as to define an annular gap 40 between the cylindrical structural member 21 and the reactor core 15 for allowing the liquid metal to exist therein, the cylindrical structural member 21 being mounted to the nuclear reactor container 11 by means of a second supporting structural member 39 . The inertial resisting force produced when the liquid metal existing in the annular gap 40 will flow out from the annular gap 40 in response to the vibration of the reactor core 15 acts such as to suppress the vibration of the reactor core 15 , thereby allowing an improvement in the anti vibration properties of the fast breeder reactor.
