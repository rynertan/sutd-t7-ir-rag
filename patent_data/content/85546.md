# Vending machine.

## Abstract
Control circuitry for a vending machine allows a number of products to be purchased during a single transaction at a reduced rate as compared with the price of a single product purchased individually. The basic product price and the prices of additional products in any one transaction are preset by means of switches 51, 52, 53 coupled to inputs I 1,2,3,4,5 of a microprocessor MP . Inputs I 11,12,13 of the micro processor are coupled to switches in the coin accepting mechanism not shown of the vending machine such that escrow credit towards the purchase of products is stored during any transaction when a vend is requested, the microprocessor automatically dispenses the number of products appropriate to the escrow credit established in its memory and if necessary activates a change return mechan ism in respect of any excess money deposited.
