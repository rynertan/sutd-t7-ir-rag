# Switching device for spectral analyzer for living tissues.

## Abstract
A sensor for a spectral analyzer includes a relatively movable holder and probe, where the probe is fitted with a reflector, and the holder is provided with a pair of adjacent optical fibers for transmitting receiving light. When the probe abuts the surface of the object to be measured, the probe and holder move relatively so that the fiber pair approach the reflector. A switch activating the analyzer for data collection is operated in response to the change in reflected light intensity caused by the relative movement.
