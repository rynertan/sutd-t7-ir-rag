# Press for continuously expressing liquid out of a mass.

## Abstract
A press for continuous expressing of a liquid from a particulate liquid solid mass of the type including a conveyor screw or auger 19 advancing the mass through a tubular housing which is provided with drainage perforations 34 . The compression and advancement of the material through the perforate section is effected by the face 28 of a reciprocating annular sleeve 27 , the stroke of the sleeve 27 being so arranged that at least one half of the travel of said face 28 takes place within the perforated area. The frequen cy of the reciprocating movement of the sleeve 27 is three cycles per second or more, to reduce resistance to the passage of the mass through the housing. The device is capable of a considerable increase in dewatering perform ance, as compared with known devices of the type operating more or less solely with a conveyor screw.
