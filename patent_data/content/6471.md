# Disk file controller.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a disk file controller for the transfer of data from a parallel by bit interface to a serial by bit disk file interface. A data channel has a data register 9 , serializing and deserializing means 50 and 53 and a variable frequency oscillator to transfer parallel by bit data received by the register 9 from a DCI BUS OUT to be recorded serially by bit on a disk file. Alternatively the data channel receives serial by bit data read from a disk file and transfers it through the data register 9 in parallel by bit form to a DCI BUS IN. The several units of the data channel are con trolled by a control register 28 supplied from a micro processor 6 . The microprocessor receives data selec tively from the DCI BUS OUT and from the data register 9 . Changes in format of the disk file data can be accom modated by the microprocessor 6 without need to change special purpose formatting hardware.
