# Apparatus for placing cones in a box.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the domain of arranging at least one layer of cones previously formed by a production apparatus, for example ice cream cornets or filled paperbags in a box. The invention has as its purpose to provide an apparatus adapted to perform such operation. To that purpose the invention provides an apparatus placing at least one layer of cones 6 , for example, icecream cornets or filled paperbags previously formed by a production and delivered in two groups in a box 28 , said apparatus comprising two parallel, double, endless conveyor apparatus 7,8 each consisting of two transport ropes driven with equal speeds and being spaced apart by a fixed distance, said ropes taking over the cones 6 at equal intervals from the cone production apparatus 5 in a manner such that the cones will hang vertically at equal distances between the two ropes 11, 12 of the respective conveying apparatus, guid member 21 provided at the end of the pairs of transport ropes for depositing the cones 6 supplied by one pair of ropes with their cone ends directed towards one side of the conveyor belt in horizontal positions and for depositing the cones supplied by the other pair of ropes with a phase difference of 180 with their cone ends directed towards the other side of the conveyor belt in a horizontal position thereof so that the cones alternatively in opposite senses will transversely of the conveyor belt and a grab 18 provided at the end of the conveyor belt for picking up from said belt a predetermined number of adjacent cones halted at an end stop 19 and placing them in the standby box 28 .
