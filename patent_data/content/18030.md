## Description
Control means for checking up the forms of games of chance This invention relates to a control means for checking up the forms of games of chance and still more particularly a control means used for checking up how many winning points have been obtained in the game of chance, said checking up being preferably carried out by the player himself.More particularly, said control means will be still generally and preferably used for controlling the so called Lotto forms the control of which is known to be relatively difficult, generally owing to the filling up of a relatively large number of boxes which must be controlled separately and also owing to the fact that it is not allowed to inscibre additional indica tions which are generally desirable in order to control such forms.The control means according to the present invention which allows to control simply and efficiently te said Lotto forms and the like comprises substantially an element of a transparent or not transparent material provided with at least one pattern corresponding with a pattern of a form of game of chance being controlled, said pattern being formed by suppressible indications corresponding to the various locations of the pattern of the form of game of chance being controlled.In order to better point our the characteristics of this invention, some preferred embodiments will be described here after by way of example and without any limitation, reference being made to the enclosed drawings in which Figure 1 is a front view of a control means according to the invention Figure 2 shows the same control means after having inscri bed the winning result of the game of chance on a tempo rary location Figure 3 is a view similar to that of Figure 2, but after having indicated the result on the correct location neces sary for readily controlling the Lotto form Figure 4 shows by way of example a filled up Lotto form Figure 5 shows the form of Figure 4 with the control means applied thereto as shown in Figure 3 Figure 6 shows a modified embodiment of the control means shown in Figure 1 Figure 7 shows, on an enlarged scale, the portion indica ted by F7 in Figure 6 Figure 8 is a view similar to that of Figure 7, but after having indicated the result Figure 9 shows a modified embodiment of Figure 7 Figure 10 is a view similar to that of Figure 8, but for the modified embodiment according to figure 9 Figures 11 and 12 show still two modified embodiments of figure 7.The control means as shown in Figure 1 comprises namely a transparent element 1 provided with two patterns 2 and 3 respectively the configuration of which corresponds with that of two superimposed patterns of a Lotto form, the Figures 1 to 40 being, in that case, inscribed in the various boxes of the patterns in the same disposition as that of the said Lotto form.In that case, near each pattern, are still provided seven boxes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 respectively which are intended to temporarily indicate therein the result which, as known in the Lotto game, consists of six figures one additional figure.The particularity of the present invention is to be seen in the fact that, in that case, the said figures are provided as a decalcomania and are thus applied on the back side of the element 1.In order to control a form 11 as shown in Figure 4, accprding to the invention, it is merely sufficient to temporarily inscribe, if desired, the result of the game of chance in the said boxes 4 to 10 and then locate the element 1 on any sheet or the like, the concerned figures of the said result being then rubbed in a known manner to be freed from the element 1, thereby forming, as shown in Figure 3, opened boxes, namely the boxes 4, 8, 17, 20 28 and 39, whereupon it is merely sufficient to apply the element 1 on the form 11 so that it will be successively located on the various patterns of said form 1 in order to control the number of winning points of each pattern thereof.In fact, when locating the element 1 on the various patterns, the indications inscribed on said pattern and mandatorily formed by small crosses, appear or not through the opened boxes, so that the number of winning points can be determined by the number of opened boxes through which appears a small cross applied on the form 11.In that case, two patterns 2 3 and two series of boxes 4 to 10 are applied on the element 1, but it is apparent that the element 1 may comprise either only one pattern 2 or only one pattern 2 and one series of boxes 4 to 10 or two or several patterns 2, 3 and a series of boxes 4 to 10 or still two or several series of patterns 2 and 3 and, for each pattern, a series of boxes 4 to 10 according to the manner of using the control means.In fact, it is possible to provide as many patterns as, e.g.patterns are present on a form 11, tut is will be preferable to provide only one of the two patterns for one element 1, since the element 1 is designed as a disposable element, in other words, an element for a single use.Although the small figures are inscribed in small boxes in the embodiment according to figure 1, it is apparent that said small boxes may be, if desired, omitted, only the said figures being provided.Figure 6 shows a modified embodiment substantially formed by providing, in that case, the front side of the element 1 with the said figures 1 to 40 in a disposition corresponding to that of the Lotto form being controlled, whereas, on the back side of the element 1, each box of the pattern 2 and or 3 is made as a decalcomania, so that it is merely sufficient to rub the figures corresponding to the result, thereby eliminating each black box to form a transparent box, which allows to compare the result with the form 11 by readily locating the element 1 on the desired patterns of the form 11, the number of winning points being then found by counting the number of small crosses appearing through a transparent box of the element 1. For the clearness of the figures 6, 7 and 8, the blackening on the back side is illustrated by cross hatchings, which can be also naturally the case.Figures 9 and 10 show an embodiment wherein the figures are so called hollow figures and wherein, as it is apparent from figure 10, still by rubbing, the blackening or hatchings applied on the back side of the element 1 are removed, thereby leaving a hollow figure thereon. In fact, in this embodiment, the result is more readily applied, since white figures are available, which is not the case in the embodiment shown in figure 6 in which the figures are inscribed on a black background.It is apparent that, instead of figures and or boxes, any other indications may be provided as a decalcomania on the correct locations and on the back side of the element 1, the purpose of this arrangement being to remove entirely or partially the indications on the locations of the winning result.Thus, these indications may be formed either by small crosses 12 as shown in figure 11, or by hollow or solid small balls 13 as shown in Figure 12, or still be any other sign.In a final possible embodiment, in order to control the form 11, the said boxes, a portion of the said boxes or a sign applied in these boxes, e.g. a circle or similar, may be stamped or punched out, thereby forming a window through which the number of winning points may be checked up. It is apparent that there is thereby obtained a control means which may be thus used as such and for which no additional accessory such as a pencil, a stylus or similar is necessary for applying indications on the element 1.Owing to the character itself of the control means, the element 1 may be also made as a very cheap and simple disposable material, thereby reducing considerably the cost price thereof.It is apparent that the invention is not at all limited to the embodiment described in the foregoing by way of example and illustrated in the attached drawings, but such control means may be made in any shape and size without departing from the scope of the invention.
