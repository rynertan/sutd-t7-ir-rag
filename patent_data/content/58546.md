# Temperature responsive air induction apparatus.

## Abstract
In an air induction apparatus for the carburettor of an internal combustion engine the temperature of air flow into an air filter is controlled by a flap 4 to meter the amount of heated air which is mixed with cold air, the control thereof being by a temperature sensitive vacuum control element 12 and in order to prevent icing under full throttle low vacuum conditions a bimetal element 23 is arranged edge on in the intake air flow path to prevent complete reclosure of the flap 4 for less than a predetermined in flow air temperature.
