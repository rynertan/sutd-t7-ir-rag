# Method and apparatus for manufacturing Venetian blinds.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for manufacturing venetian blinds in which at least two ladder tapes, preferably with rungs each consisting of at least two cross cords, are pro vided, of a sufficient length for a large number of venetian blinds. The slats are inserted between the cross cords of the ladder tapes to form a substantially continuous mat 40 of slatted ladder tape. The mat is then stored, for example, on a roll 36 or in a container, and is subsequently cut off into individual lengths, each length being suitable for one blind.
