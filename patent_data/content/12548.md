# Process for the preparation of substituted glyoxylic acids and derivatives thereof and acids and derivatives so produced.

## Abstract
Substituted glyoxyiic acids or derivatives of such acids are prepared by reacting an acyl nitrile with concentrated sul phuric acid in the presence of halide anion to form a first reaction product and then further reacting the first reaction product with a compound of the general formula ROH to form the desired glyoxylic acid or glyoxylic acid derivative.
