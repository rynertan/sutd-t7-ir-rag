# Panel and apparatus for its manufacture.

## Abstract
A rod 18 , preferably made of metal and partially or completely threaded 17 , is introduced into a body 19 that is preferably wooden and previously drilled, applying a rotary motion at one end of the said rod by appropriate means, the rod and the wooden body being thus intimately joined through the effect of self threading. When one or several rods go through a number of wooden elements, a very effective union is obtained between the elements. Through this means the mechanical resistance of a piece can be increased and units can be produced through the accumulation of elements joined by this method. The units can be articulated. An apparatus is presented which can do the job automatically.
