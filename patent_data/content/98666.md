# Method of and device for manufacturing wire strands.

## Abstract
A method and a device are provided for manufacturing a wire strand comprising a number of insulated wires extending between two connector blocks to which each wire is connected at its ends. A wire is wound several times round two spaced points of supports wherein are adjustable to vary the distance between them, the resulting turns of wire being disposed at equal dis tances from one another on the points of support. Subsequently, at one of the points of support, the wire turns and connected to the connectors of two connector blocks each comprising a number of connectors corresponding to the number of wire turns, after which the turns are secered between the two connector blocks.
