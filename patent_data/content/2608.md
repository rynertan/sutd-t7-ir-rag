# Sensing transducer.

## Abstract
A transducer 1 is disclosed which contains a field creating means 3 and a sensing means 5 responsive to changes in that field on the proximity of an article 7 thereto. By observing any change in the sensing means 5 information concerning the passing of the article 7 can be ascertained. Preferably the transducer 1 has additional field creating means 9 associated therewith whereby to cause disturbance to the field created by the field creating means 3 whereby to cause the sensing means 5 to operate and additionally provides a field checking facility for the field creating means 3 by either simulating the disturbance of the field which would be caused by the proximity of the article 7 or by changing the field while the article 7 is present. Thus the transducer 1 is checked as to operation of the sensing means 5 and as to presence of the field from the field creating means 3. A transducer element 50 comprising two such transducers 51 and 52 spaced apart is also disclosed. Such a transducer 50 enables detection of velocity and direction of movement of the article past the transducer 50. A method of detecting information as to the passing of an article is also disclosed.
