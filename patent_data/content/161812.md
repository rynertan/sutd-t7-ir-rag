# Multimanifold extrusion die and coextrusion process.

## Abstract
A multi manifold extrusion die 10 which comprises a a first flow channel 12 and a second flow channel 14 which traverse the die and converge at a point of con vergence 18 within the die 10 and b free floating, pivoting divider means 26 disposed between the first and second flow channels 12, 14 wherein each of said flow channels 12, 14 comprises, in order downstream towards the convergence point 18 , a manifold chamber 46, 48 , a pressure compensating restric tion channel 52, 54 formed in part by a head portion of the divider means 26 , an expansion chamber 58, 60 , and a tapered flow restriction channel 64, 66 , in which each expan sion chamber 58, 60 has a cross section greater than that of the respective channels 52, 64 54, 66 wherein each manifold chamber 46, 48 has a longitudinal dimension of sufficient magnitude that a molten thermoplastic stream exiting therefrom is at a relatively greater pressure at a side to side midpoint than at the sides thereof wherein each pressure compensating restriction channel 52, 54 is of increasing cross sectional area from the centre to each end thereof, so as to provide inverse resistance to flow whereby a molten thermoplastic stream which is at said relatively greater pressure, prior to flowing through the pressure compensating restriction channel 52, 54 exits
