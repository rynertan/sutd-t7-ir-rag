# Industrial or domestic overvoltage protective device.

## Abstract
According to the invention, the device includes two detec tors of overvoltages 8,9 respectively connected between each of the power line conductors 1,2 and one input of the arrester 7 , and having their outputs connected to an OR gate 10 the output signal of which is applied to a threshold gate 12 . The output of this last is connected to a first monostable trigger 13 having a first time constant and controlling, through a latch gate 14 , a bipolar insulating device 3,4 isolating the load 90 from the power network. In order to achieve the automatic reconnection of the load after each perturbance, the output of the latch gate 14 is also connected to a second monostable trigger 16 having a second time constant higher than the first, and to the clock input of a counter 15 having its return to zero terminal connected at the output of the second monostable trigger. Preferably, an integrator 11 is connec ted between the OR gate 10 and the threshold gate 12 . For industrial or domestic uses.
