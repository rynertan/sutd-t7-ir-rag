# Perfumery compositions.

## Abstract
3,3 dimethyl 1,5 dioxaspiro 5,5 undecane is useful in perfumery compositions. It can be made economically by reaction of cyclohexanone with neopentyl glycol in the presence of an acid, generally paratoluene sulphonic acid, under dehydrating conditions, generally by refluxing with a non polar solvent.
