# DESACETYLTHYMOSIN ALPHA 1, ITS PROCESS OF PREPARATION AND ITS USE

## Abstract
The present invention concerns desacetylthymosin alpha 1, an immune restorative polypeptide hormone. This polypeptide is synthesized in E. coil using recombinant DNA cloning techniques. Based on the known amino acid sequence, a gene coding for thymosin alpha 1 was de signed and enzymatically assembled from chemically syn thesized oligodeoxyribonucleotide fragments. The gene was ligated into plasmid pBR322, placed under lac operon control, and thymosin alpha 1 expressed as part of a Î² galactosidase chimeric protein. Cyanogen bromide cleav age of this protein gave a mixture of polypeptides among which thymosin alpha 1 was detected by radioimmuno assay. The E. coli product is identical to thymosin alpha 1 isolated from calf thymus in amino acid sequence and exhibits similar activity in a radioimmunoassay. The compound is hence a candidate for administra tion in effective immunopotentiating dosage in the treat ment of immuno depressed and immuno suppressed con ditions.
