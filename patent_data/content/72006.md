# Blood collector for microcollection container.

## Abstract
A cap 10 is provided for a blood microcollection container 44 which cap 10 incorporates a partially open tubular and tapered scoop 20 arrangement for engaging a puncture wound, and rapidly receiving blood from the wound. The scoop 20 arrangement is such that substantial end surface 24 is provided for engaging a puncture wound for receiving blood, and rapidly trans ferring it to the microcollection container 44 where a further large abutting angular surface engages the sur face of the microcollection container 44 . A vent 30 is incorporated into the cap 10 for air displacement for enhancing the rapid transfer of blood and avoiding coagu lation. With this invention, the time of transfert is re duced substantially because a less precise positioning is required of the scoop 20 , and the need to initiate a capillary action is avoided.
