## Description
CIRCUIT AND METHOD FOR SPLIT BIAS ENABLJS INBIBIT MEMORY OPERATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a circuit and method for selectively enabling and disabling a split differential amplifier. More partictlarly, the present invention relates to a circuit and method for combining the functions of signal amplifying, buffering, and output enabling in a memory device by use of split bias enabling.2. Description of the Prior Art Circuits and techniaues for communicating the contents of a solid state memory to other devices are well known. Such circuits receive a differential input, indicative of memory cell contents at an associated memory location, and produce a corresponding logic level output signal A memory select or output enable inhibit feature is typically included with such circuits. Accordingly, an output signal is produced only when required and as selected. Fig. 1 shows a prior art differential amplifier circuit 10, which consists of transistors Ql Q4 and resistors R1 and R2. A logic high or low output signal is produced at transistor Q9 output enable inhi bit is controlled by transistors Q5 Q8 . In operation, if the memory cell contents to be transferred by circuit 10 are a logic high, a logic high signal IN is present at the base of transistor Q1 and a logic low signal IN. is present at the base of transistor Q4. As a result, a current 1D is steered through resistor R1 and thereafter through each of tran sistors Q1 and Q3.Current 1D is split at the collectors of transistors Q1 and Q3. A current 1n 2 flows through each of transistors Q1 and Q3 and, thereafter, through transistors 27 and Qa, respectively. voltage drop is developed across resistorR2 as a result of steering current 1D through transistors Ql and Q9. The voltage is coupled to the base of transistor Q9, turning transistor Q9 on, and producing a logic high output signal at the emitter of transistor Q9 If the memory contents transferred by circuit 10 are a logic low, a logic low input signal Is present at the base of transistor Q1, and a logic high signal is present at the base of transistor Q4. As a result, current ID is steered through resistor R2 and thereafter through each of transistors Q2 and Q4 current ID 2 flows through each of transistors Q2 and 24 and thereafter, through transistors Q7 and Q8, respectively.The voltage drop developed across resistor R2 and coupled to the base of transistor Q9 turns transistor Q9 off because current i is now steered through resistor R2 and transistors 22 and Q4. Therefore, a logic low output signal is produced at the emitter of transistor Q9. A BIAS 1 signal, present at the base of transistors QZ, 23, and Q5, sets a voltage level relative to which input signal IN must be more positive and relative to which input signal IN must be more negative if circuit 10 is to produce a logic high output signal at the emitter of transistor Q9 BIAS 1 signal also sets the voltage level relative to which input signalIN must be more negative and relative to which input signal IN must be more positive if circuit 10 is to produce a logic low output at the emitter of transistorQ9 A second BIAS signal BIAS 2 is coupled to the base of transistors Q7 and Q8 to establish an output enable voltage level. An output enable signal OE is coupled to the base of transistor Q6.Circuit 10 is operated when output signal OE is a logic low relative to the BIAS 2 signal. When output enable signal OE is a logic high relative to the BIAS 2 signal, transistorQ6 conducts and steers current through transistors QS and Q6 through resistor R2 producing a voltage drop across resistor R2.. As a result, a logic low output signal is produced at the emitter of transistor Q9 without regard to logic input signals IN and IN . When the circuit is enabled, differential amplifier pairs consisting of transistors Q1 and Q2, and Q3 and Q4 are operative as follows Reading a 1 Reading a 0 IN base Q1 high relative low relative to Bias 1 to Bias 1IN base Q4 low relative high relative to Bias 1 to Bias 1Q1 On On OffQ2 Off On Q3 On offQ4 Off On I thru R2 s ID When disabled transistors Q7 and Q8 are off and transistor Q6 is on.The transistor Q1, Q2 and transistor Q3, Q4 differential amplifiers are not operative as follows EMI3.1 tb SEP Disabled SEP Enabled tb IQIJ SEP SEP inoperative SEP I SEP depends SEP on tb Q2 SEP l SEP SEP no SEP emitter SEP logic SEP state SEP at SEP I tb IQ3 SEP 1 SEP current SEP I SEP input SEP IN SEP IN SEP I tb SEP Q7, SEP Q8 SEP SEP are SEP off SEP I SEP see SEP above tb I SEP I SEP I tb Q5 SEP I SEP On SEP I SEP off tb I SEP I tb 06 SEP I SEP On SEP I SEP off tb I SEP I SEP Off SEP I tb Q7 SEP I SEP Off SEP I SEP On SEP I tb I SEP I SEP I SEP SEP I tb IQS SEP SEP I SEP Off SEP SEP I SEP On SEP I tb One disadvantage of such prior art circuits is the need to provide a current path through transistors Q7 and Q8. transistors must be, of necessity, large in si7e to steer current 4 which may be on the order of 6 mIlliamperes . Such large transistors slow circuit response time by increasing circuit parasi tic capacitance. Precise current steering also Is Inhibited by transistors Q7 and QB, .unless identical matched transistors are used to balance the transistor 5 steering of current ID The additional functional elements required by prior art enabling circuits increase both space and power requirements, while substantially slowing circuit response time. These limitations are particularly noticeable in high speed electronic devices, such as solid state memory circuits. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION INVENTION The present invention combines the functions of signal amplifying, buffering, and output enabling.The invention consists of a differential amplifier stage, an output stage, and an enable inhibit stage. The differential amplifier stage includes two differential transistor pairs coupled to steer a current ID along one of two selected current paths. When operated in conjunction with a solld state memory circuit, the differential amplifying stage controls the output stage to produce an output logic signal that corresponds to a differential logic input signal. The differential transistor pairs each include an input terminal that is coupled to detect a logic high signal INt or a logic low signal IN , respectively.Current ID is steered along one of the two current paths in response to the logic signal level detected by the dirferential transistor pairs. Output stage operation is a function of current 1D flow along one of the two selected current paths. The enable inhibit stage maintains a balanced bias signal on a control terminal portion of each of the differential transistor pairs to enable circuit operation. Circuit operation is inhibited when the bias signal is split or unbalanced. In such condition, current It is continually steered along a corresponding logic low current path. This produces a continual logic low output signal that remains unaffected by varying input conditions at the differential transistor pairs. Accordingly, the present invention provides a split bias current steering circuit that, when enabled, provides a selected logic output signal corresponding to a differential logic input signal. Current flow in the circuit is evenly divided between two active devices, e.g., one transistor leg of each of tse two differential transistor pairs. As a result, the required power handling capacity of the active devices in the circuit may be significantly reduced without affecting circuit operation or reliability. The size of the circuit functional elements, such as the differential transistors, is accordingly reduced, as is the space necessary to integrate the circuit onto a monolithic substrate or to lay out the circuit on a printed circuit board if discrete devices are used . The number of functional elements required to implement the present invention also is significantly reduced. This reduction in circuit overhead and the small size of the functional elements used in the circuit, significantly reduces parasitic capacitance and current loading. As a result, extremely fast circuit response time is advantageously provided by the present invention. The invention1s fast response time makes it particularly useful in memory circuits where rapid and reliable data transfer is critical. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. I is a schematic diagram of a prior art memory enable inhibit circuit, and Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary split bias enable Inhibit circuit accordiw to the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a split bias enable inhibit circuit 20, is shown in Fig. 2. The invention combines the functions of signal amplifying, buffering, and output signal enable inhibit. Although the preferred embodiment of the invention incorporates a split differential amplifier, it should be appreciated that the present invention can also provide enable inhibit control of standard differential amplifier circuits. In the embodiment of the invention shown inFig. 2, three circuit stages are provided a differential amplifier pair input stage 21 and 26, an output stage 22, and an enable inhibit stage 25. The differential amplifier pair input stage 21 and 26 includes dif ferential transistor pairs Qll and Q12, and Q13 andQ14. The differential transistor pairs are arranged to form two parallel paths for routing current ID it1, and ID2 to current sink VEE. The collectors of transistors Qll and Q13 are coupled to current source ID through resistor Rll and the collectors of transistors Q12 andQ14 are coupled to current source ID through resistorR12.This arrangement establishes a first current path through transistors Qll and Q13 by which a current I 2 may be conducted through each of transistors Qll andQ13 and it establishes an alternate current path through transistors Q12 and Q14 by which current I 2 2 may be conducted through each of transistors Q12 and Q14. Output stage 22 includes a transistor Q19 having a collector and base terminal coupled across a resistor R12. An output signal is developed at the emitter of transistor Q9 in accordance with. a voltage at its base, established at a circuit node C. Enablyinhibit stage 25 may be of any type of circuit that provides a selectable balanced unbalanced split bias signal at circuit nodes A and 3. The en , able inhibIt stage includes a buffer amplifier 23 and 24 coupled to circuit nodes A and B, respectivelyBuffer amplifiers 23 and 24 are controlled by transistors Q15 and Q16. Transistors Q15 and Q16 comprise a differential amplifier. Bias 1 is connected to the base of transistor Q15 and the output enable signal OE is connected to the base of transistor Q16. When OE is low relative to Bias 1, the output is enabled and transistor Q15 is on and transistor Q16 is off.Current 1El flows through transistor Q15 and resistor R13. Current flows thr ugW resistor R14. Currents IE1 and IE2, and resistors RI3 and R14 are chosen so that the voltage drop across resistor R13 is the same as the voltage drop across resistor R14 to force the voltage at node A to be equal to the voltage at node B, between the high and low levels at the bases of transistors Q11 and Q13. When OE is high relative to Bias 1, the output is disabled, and transistor Q15 is off and transistor Q16 is on. Current IEl flows through transistor Q16 and resistor R14 current 1E2 also flows through resistor R14. Currents 1El and IE2, and resistors R13 and R14 are chosen so that the voltage drop across resistor R14 is sufficient to force node B lower than the lowest low level at the base of transistor Q14. Transistor Q14 is now always on steering current 1D2 ID 2 out of nodeC. Voltage VCC and IN , coupled to the base of transistor Qll, are chosen so that the voltage at node A is always high relative to the voltage at IN . TransistorQ12 is always on, steering current ID1 Ig2 out of node C. The combination of. currents IDI and 1D2 generate suffic ient voltage drop across resistor R12 so that the voltage at node C is low and the output is low. As an example of circuit operation assume that the contents of a memory cell, are a logic high. sccordingly, a logic high signal is present at the base of transistor Qll IN and a logic low signal is present at the base of transistor Q14 IN . Transistor Qll conducts, allowing current ID to flow through resistor Rill. Current ID is split evenly between transistorsQll and Ql3 each of the transistors conducts a current Ig 2 Neither of the transistors need be large enough to conduct the entire current ID Accordingly, the transistors may be smaller in size to resultingly exhibit a faster response time, due to a reduction in. the parasitic capacitance associated with larger sized devices. When logic high signal IN is positive relative to node A and IN is negative relative to node B, currentID is drawn away from resistor R12. Because there is no current flow through transistors Q12 and Q14,no voltage drop is developed across resistor R12,a V, voltage is coupled to the base of transistor Q19, turning the transistor on, and a high output signal is produced at the emitter of transistor Q19 In this way, logic high memory contents in a corresponding memory cell are coupled through the circuit, amplified as necessary by the transistor pairs , and buffered. When a logic low is stored in a corresponding memory cell, IN is positive relative to node B and IN is negative relative to node A, turning transistors 412 and Q14 on and routing current ID through resistor R12.Thereafter, current 1D is split by transistors Q12 and Qlc such that each transistor conducts a current Tv 2 Because under these conditions a constant current flows through resistor R12 and transistors Q12 and Q14, there is a voltage drop across resistor R12. Accordingly, a low signal is developed at the base of transistor Ql9. The transistor therefore remains turned off and no signal is produced at the emitter of transistor Ql9. This condition corresponds to a logic low output signal. In this way, logic low memory contents are coupled through the circuit. When enabled, the voltages at node A and nodeB are chosen so that node A is between the high and low level at IN and node B is between the high and low levels at IN , as follows Enabled Disabled Read 1 Read B Read 1 Read Qll On Off Off OffQ12 Off On On On 213 On Off Off OffQ14 Off On On On thru R 125 thru R12 IN High Low Low Low Qll base Relative Relative Relative Relative A A A AIN Low High . High High Q14 base Relative Relative Relative Relative B B B BNode A Med. Med. High HighNode B ed. ged. Low Low Accordingly, the present invention provides signal amplifying, buffering, and output enable inhibit by use of split biasing with a differential transistor pair circuit.Current is steered to provide a logic output signal in accordance with a logic input signal when circuit operation is enabled. Circuit output is held at a constant level without regard to the circuit input signal level when circuit operation is inhibited. Because the enable nhibit circuit is also used to bias the differential amplifier stages in both the enabled and inhibited modes, a standby current is not required and standby power loss is reduced. The present circuit operates efficiently with a low voltage power supply, for instance, in a battery operated device operating on weak batteries, because there are few gating transistors in series that would affect circuit operation. The present invention substantially reduces layout area by reducing the number of high current carrying transistors and by reducing the size of each transistor proportional to the amount of current it must carry. Such advantageous results are the effect of splitting the driving current evenly through one leg of each transistor pair along the selected current path. Accordingly, any number of differential amplifiers can be controlled by the enable inhibit circuitry, as for example, in memory devices having several controlled memory cells. One advantage of the present invention is the novel control of several differential stages by a single enable stage. For example, in memory device, all the memory cells in a particular row or column may be enabled simultaneously by a single enable circuit. Thus, a differential transistor pair is associated with each memory cell several differential transistor pairs are coupled in parallel at circuit nodes A and B for control by enable inhibit stage 25. The reduction in component size and in the number of components required also eliminates the requirement of complex biasing signals for multiple stage amplifiers. By reducing current carrying requirements, parasitic capacitance is significantly reduced and circuit response is radically improved. The present invention may be operated in a memory device such as a bipolar static RAM at speeds as fast as five nanosecond. Such high speed memories readily find application in many electronic devices, such as microcircuit testing devices where test vectors are rapidly moved through the tester and into the tested device. The foregoing was given for purposes of illu station and example. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention is readily practiced in various equivalent applications and mhodi ments. For example, the enable inhibit stage may be modified as desired, the only requirement being that the bias signal provided to circuit nodes A and B be balanced to enable circuit operation and be split to inhabit circuit operation. Additionally, the present invention may zind application in devices other than solid state memory devices. For example, the invention may be used to control differential amplifiers. Therefore, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the breadth of the claims.
