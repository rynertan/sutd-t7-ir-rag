# Power assistance device.

## Abstract
A power assistance device has a double acting piston and cylinder whose piston rod is connected to an output. Compressed air is passed via a pair of air pressure regulators to opposite sides of the piston. Each regulator has a regulator spring, and the regulators are housed in a body which is moved upon manual effort being applied to an input to cause the springs to differentially bias so decreasing pressure on one side of the piston and increasing pressure on its opposite side, creating a pressure differential across the piston causing it to move with its piston rod to apply a magnified load to the output which is proportional to the manual effort applied to the input. The regulators could be set so that in a neutral position of the power assistance device, zero pressures exist on opposite sides of the piston. In an alternative arrangement a pair of single acting piston and cylinder devices could be used. Other gaseous fluids could be utilized, and a hydraulic fluid could also be used as the pressurized fluid medium.
