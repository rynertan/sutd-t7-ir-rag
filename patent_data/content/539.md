Copper complexes of N pyrazole, N imidazole and N triazoleacetanilide derivatives as fungicides.The present invention relates to copper complexes of N pyrazolen N imidazole and N triazole aniline derivatives, a process for their preparation, compositions containing them and their use in combatting phytopathogenic fungi.The aniline derivatives which form the basis of the copper complexes of the invention are in part known fromGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,643,477 which also describes their fungicidal activity.The complexes of the present invention have been found to possess a high fungicidal activity over a prolonged period.More particularly the present invention provides complexes of the formula IEMI1.1 whereinR1 and R2 represent independently of each other methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy or halogen,R3 represents hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, Cl C4 alkoxy or halogen,R4 represents hydrogen or methyl,R5 representsEMI2.1 R6 represents 1,2 pyrazole, 1,3 imidazole, 1,2,4 triazole l or 1,2,4 triazole 4 1 A represents the anion of an organic or inorganic acid and n stands for the number 1 or 2 and p stands for a number from 1 to 12 inclusive.According to the number of carbon atoms present the following are to be understood as alkyl or as alkyl moiety of an alkoxy group methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, sec butyl or tert butyl.Halogen stands for fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.The following are examples of acids from which anion A may be derived e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, acetic acid, haloacetic acids, propionic acid, halopropionic acids, butyric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid or benzoic acid. The number p indicates the degree of hydration and will not necessarily be a whole number.The complexes of the invention are stoichiometrically precisely defined compounds.The complexes of the formula I may be prepared analogously to known methods for example as followsEMI3.1 suitable solvents are for example alcohols such as methanol and ethanol ketones such as acetone and methylethylketone acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, methylcellosolve and water as well. as mixtures thereof.The process is advantageously carried out in. the presence of ammonium chldride. The reaction temperature lies between 0 and 1000 C preferably 20 50 C. The process is carried out under normal pressure.The above process also forms part of the invention.The complexes of the formula I contain in the group R5 an asymetrical carbon atom adjacent to the aniline nitrogen and may be obtained as optical antipodes in conventional manner e.g. employing already separated starting materials .The two configurations of such a compound of the formula I exhibit different degrees of microbicidal activity. The effect of further possible centres of asymetry and the atropisomerism about the phenyl N axis on the microbicidal action of the entire molecule is apparently negligible, Carrying out the process of the invention without attempting to separate the pure isomers of the complex produces a racemic mixture thereof.In a further embodiment of the invention the complexes of the formula I are mixed with suitable carriers and or other additives to give fungicidal compositions.Suitable carriers and additives can be solid or liquid and are those normally used in the art of formulation, for example natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilisers. The preparation of the compositions is effected in known manner by intimately mixing the constituents.The following are examples of compositions according to the invention percentages refer to advantageous amounts by weight of active substance Solid formulations dusts, tracking agents, up to 10 ,granules coated granules, impregnated granules and homogenous granules pellets 1 to 80 Liquid formulations a active substance concentrates which are dispersible in water wettable powders, pastes 25 90 in commercial packs, 0.01 to 15 in ready for use solutions emulsions concentrated solutions 10 to 50 0.01 to 15 in ready for use solutions . b Solutions, aerosols.The content of active substance in the above described compositions is between 0.1 and 9o by weight.The compounds of the formula I can be used together with other suitable pesticides, for example fungicides, insecticides, acaricides or active substances which influence plant growth, in order to broaden the activity spectrum of the formulations and to adapt them to prevailing circumstances.The complexes of the formula I are suitable for the protection of horticultural and agricultural crops and cultures from attack by phytopathogenic fungi. Examples of such crops and cultures are maize, vegetables, sugarbeet, soya, ground nuts, fruit trees, ornamentals, vines, hops, cucumber plants cucumber, marrows, melons, squash , solanaceae such as potatoes, tobacco plants and tomatoes and also banana, cocoa and rubber plants.With the active compounds of the formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy the fungi which occur in plants or parts of plants fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots in these and related cultures and also to protect from attack by such fungi parts of the plants which grow later. Typical of such fungi are those which belong to the following classestAscomycetes e.g. Erysiphaceae Basidiomycetes, in particular rust fungi fungi imperfecti e.g. Cercospora and especially Oomycetes belonging to the class of the Phycomycetes, such as Phytophthora, Pythium or Plasmopara. In addition, the compounds of the formula I possess a systemic action.They can also be used as seed dressing agents for protecting seeds fruit, tubers, grains and plant cuttings from fungal infections and from phytopathogenic fungi which occur in the soil.A further aspect of the invention therefore concerns the use of the complexes of the Formula I in combatting phytopathogenic fungi. Preferred complexes are those of the formula I whereinR1 represents methylR2 represent methyl or chlorine andR3 represents hydrogen, chlorine, bromine or methyl.Preferred as substituent R6 is the 1,2,4 triazole group.The anions of inorganic acids are preferred as the group A.X is preferably theEMI6.1 group and especially theEMI6.2 group.Combination of the various compound groups are of particular interest.The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Unless otherwise stated, a compound of the formula I is always obtained as a racemic mixture of possible isomers.Temperatures are given in degrees centigrade, pressures in utillibars and parts and percentages are by weight.
