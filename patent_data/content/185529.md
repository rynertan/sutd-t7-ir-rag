## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and, more particularly, to a dynamic random access memory wherein each memory cell comprises one transistor and one capacitor, and data can be randomly read written. In the recent computer controlled data processing field, types and amounts of data to be processed are increasing. An important problem is indicated by the strong demand which has arisen for high speed accessing for the data read write operation. Meanwhile, the memory capacity of a dynamic random access memory to be referred to as a dRAM hereinafter has been greatly improved in accordance with developments in the micro patterning technique of memory cell patterns. Thus, a large amount of data can be stored in a single memory device of one chip. As a result, the demand for high speed data accessing of dRAM has increased in strength. Today, in order to improve the data access speed of dRAM, a large number of data access drive methods have been developed and proposed. For example, a page mode dRAM has been proposed. According to a dRAM of this type, unlike a conventional memory wherein row and column address lines i.e., word and bit lines must be reset and pre charged every time selection of one cell is completed, even after a cell is selected, word lines connected to the selected cell are not reset but are continuously activated. In the readout mode of this dRAM, after a desired cell is selected the word line connected thereto is left activated. Therefore, when another desired cell is designated by using only a bit line from the other cells connected to this word line, high speed selection can be achieved. As a result, the data access speed of the page mode dRAM can be increased to twice that of a normal mode dRAM. Furthermore, as a method of improving data access speed, a dRAM can be driven in a nibble mode. Basically, cell selection is performed so that four cells i.e., 4 bits connected to intersections between two adjacent word lines and two adjacent bit lines are used as one unit. During cell designation, the two word lines are continuously activated. A desired cell is designated by a shiftregister from the designated four cells. At this time, since no column address clock signal is requires, the two bit lines need not be pre charged in order to designate one desired cell from four cells. Therefore, the data access speed of the dRAM can be further improved as compared to the page mode dRAM. According to the above dRAMs, however, the pre charge operation cannot be completely eliminated from all the operation modes. Yet, presence of a pre charge period means degradation in improvement in data access speed. This is because during the pre charge period data accessing cannot be performed, with the pre charge time undesirably protracting the time needed for data accessing. Therefore, even though the above method is used, data access speed of a dRAM is limited and cannot cope with demand for further improvement. For example, the page mode dRAM requires a pre charge operation when data accessing is shifted from one word line to another word line, a pre charge operation that takes the same period of time as in a normal mode dRAM. In the nibble mode dRAM, when a set 4 bits of cells is shifted to another set 4 bits of cells, a pre charge operation is, likewise, required. Even in a MOS dRAM, having a relatively short memory access time, eg, 100 nano seconds, it takes 100 nano seconds to pre charge bit lines and a clock generator. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved dynamic semiconductor memory device which can read write data during a pre charge period therefore greatly improving data access speed. US patent number 4106109 discloses a dynamic semiconductor memory device comprising In this context, we acknowledge the relevance under EPC Art. 54 3 of our European Patent Application No. 0129651 claiming an earlier priority date, and designating DE, FR and GB only.

The above mentioned memory cell MC can be called a dynamic memory cell so as to distinguish it from the static memory cell 20, as needed. The latch memory cell 20 is connected to the bit lines Bi and Bi , constituting the ith bit line pair, through the first transfer gate section 30 i. The latch memory cell 20 comprises a static flip flop circuit as in other latch memory cells not shown .

The operation mode of the dRAM, according to the embodiment of the present invention with the above configuration, will be described with reference to Figs. 3A to 3T and 4A to 4T. First, a normal data access operation and an operation for transferring data stored in a desired latch memory cell onto the input output lines 50 and 50 during the pre charge period of the bit lines will be described with reference to Figs. 3A to 3T. In the data access mode of the dRAM, since the voltage level of the clock line K3 is set at In this state, as shown in Fig. 3A, when an RAS row address strobe signal falls from a high level voltage VIH to a low level voltage VIL before a change in level occurs at a column address strobe signal CAS signal, the potential of the pre charge clock line K3 falls from the voltage Thereafter, for example, the memory cell word line MW1 and the dummy cell word line DW2 are selected. When the potential of the lines MW1 and DW2 rises from the voltage Vss to the voltage Thereafter, the sense clock signal supplied to the clock line K1 for the sense amplifier 10 gradually drops from a voltage difference between the voltages Vdd and Vth indicated by Vdd Vth in Fig. 3I , to the ground potential Vss, as shown in Fig. 31. Thus, the sense amplifier 10 is activated. Figs. 3J and 3K show changes in the potential of bit lines Bi and Bi . When the sense amplifier 10 is activated, the potential of the bit line Bi , which completes voltage transfer in the dummy cell DC2, drops from the potential Vdd to the ground potential Vss, as shown in Fig. 3K. The potential of the bit line Bi, which reads out the 1 data from the memory cell MC1, is held at Vdd. At this time, the potential of the bit line Bi falls slightly and temporarily due to coupling and racing, with respect to the bit line Bi as shown in Fig. 3J. However, this change in level is soon recovered, and the potential of the bit line Bi is constantly maintained at the voltage Vdd. This is because the clock signal supplied to the clock line K2, which is connected to the pull up circuit 12, rises from the voltage Vss to the voltage Vdd, as shown in Fig. 3C, to start the pull up operation of the circuit 12. Upon start of the active pull up operation of the circuit 12, the FET Q5 is rendered conductive, thereby supplying the voltage Vdd to the bit line Bi through the FET Q5. After the potential changes from the voltage Vss to the voltage Vdd in response to the clock signal K2, as shown in Fig. 3C, the transfer gate clock signal supplied to the clock line K5, which is connected to the first gate transfer section 30, rises from the voltage Vss to the voltage The other latch memory cells i.e., the static memory cells 20 1, 20 2,... shown in Fig. 1 are operated in the same manner as described above. Therefore, the potentials of all the memory cells connected to the designated memory cell word line in this case, the line MW1 and those of the dummy cells connected to the dummy cell word line in this case, the line DW2 are transferred to and held in the node line pairs A and A of the corresponding latch memory cells. In other words, the storage contents of all the memory cells connected to a designated memory cell word line are statically stored in the corresponding latch memory cells 20 1, 20 2,...,20 i,.... When the column select signal supplied to the column select line CSi is changed from the voltage Vss to the voltage Thereafter, when the CAS signal rises from the voltage VIL to the voltage VIH, as shown in Fig. 3B, the potential at the lines MW1 and DW2 falls from A case will be described wherein the CAS signal falls from the high voltage An operation for writing data stored in a desired latch memory cell into the corresponding dynamic memory cell will be described with reference to Figs. 4A to 4T. Figs. 4A to 4T are waveform charts of electrical signals generated from the main parts of the dRAM of the embodiment when data held in the specific latch memory cell is to be written in the corresponding memory cell in the dRAM. Figs. 4A to 4T correspond to Figs. 3A to 3T. Figs. 4A and 4B show waveforms of the RAS and CAS signals. Figs. 4C to 4F show waveforms of the clock signals supplied to the clock lines K2 to K5. Figs. 4G and 4H show changes in potential of the memory cell word line MW1 and the dummy cell word line DW2. Fig. 4I shows a waveform of the clock signal supplied to the clock line K1 which is connected to the sense amplifier 10. Figs. 4J and 4K show changes in potential of the ith bit line pair Bi and Bi . Figs. 4L and 4M show changes in potential of the node line pair Ai and Ai of the latch memory cell connected to the lines Bi and Bi . Fig. 4N shows the waveform of the column select signal CSLi. Figs. 4O and 4P show changes in potential of the input output line pair 50 and 50 . Fig. 4Q shows an output data potential. Fig. 4R shows the waveform of a column select signal CSLj not shown in Fig. 2 supplied to the jth bit line pair. Figs. 4S and 4T show changes in potential of the capacitor nodes N2 and N1 of the dummy cell DC2 and the memory cell MC1 which are connected to the ith bit line pair. As shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, when the CAS signal is changed from a high potential VIH to a low potential VIL prior to the RAS signal, the pre charge clock signal K3 falls from the voltage The latch memory cell 20 can statically store the data of the previously selected memory cell MC1 continuously even during the pre charge period of the bit lines. When the FETs Q20 and Q21 included in the first transfer gate section 30 are rendered conductive in response to the transfer gate drive clock signal K5, the potentials of the node lines Ai and Ai of the latch memory cell see Figs. 4L and 4M are transferred to the corresponding ith bit line pair Bi and Bi through the transfer gate 20 i. As a result, the potential level of the bit line Bi falls from the voltage Vdd to the voltage Vss, as shown in Fig. 4J, and at the same time, the potential level of the bit line Bi is continuously held at the power supply voltage Vdd, as shown in Fig. 4K. Thereafter, when the word lines MW1 and DW2 are selected, a logical value corresponding to the voltage Vss, transferred from the node line Ai of the latch memory cell 20 to the bit line Bi, is written in the memory cell capacitor C5. As a result, as shown in Figs. 4S and 4T, the potentials of the nodes N2 and N1 are changed. During this interval, the lines 50 and 50 are constantly kept at the voltage Vdd see Figs. 40 and 4P , and the output data potential is kept at an intermediate potential Hiz between logic 1 level and logic 0 level see Fig. 4Q . During the above mentioned operation, the ith column select signal CSLi and the other column select signal CSLj are constantly held at the potential Vss see Figs. 4N and 4R . According to the dRAM with the auxiliary static cells of the present invention, storage data of all the memory cells connected to a selected memory word line are supplied to the corresponding latch memory cells 20 , and are statically held thereby. Such static data storage in the latch memory cells is continuously performed until the next word line is designated. Therefore, during the pre charge period of the bit lines, performed in the above operation, if storage data in another memory cell must be read out from the memory cells connected to the selected word line, the latch memory cell corresponding to the certain memory cell can be designated so as to read out the data therefrom. If necessary, accessing of storage data of the latch memory cell can be repeated even in the pre charge period until the next word line is designated. As for the memory cells connected to the selected word line, data accessing therebetween is not limited to the pre charging operation, and can be repeated a desired number of times. Therefore, data access speed of the dRAM can be greatly improved. Furthermore, according to the present invention, data stored in the latch memory cell once can be rewritten, as needed in a corresponding memory cell even in the pre charge period of the bit lines. As a result, operation speed in the data write mode can also be improved. Although the present invention has been shown and described with reference to particular embodiments, various changes and modifications which are obvious to a person skilled in the art and to which the invention pertains are deemed to lie within the scope of the invention. For example, in the above embodiment, the folded bit line configuration has been exemplified. However, the present invention can be applied to a dRAM of an open end bit line configuration. As well, the present invention can also be applied to a static RAM.
