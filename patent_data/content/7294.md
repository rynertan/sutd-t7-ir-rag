If coated tablets are wanted, the above prepared core may be coated with a concentra ted solution of sugar, which solution may contain, e.g., gum arabicum, gelatin, talc, titanium dioxide, or the like.Furthermore, the tablets may be coated with a laquer dissolved in an easily volatile organic solvent, or mixture of solvents.To this coating a dye may be added in order to easily distinguist between tablets with different active compounds or with differsnt amounts of the active compound present.In the preparation of soft gelatine capsules tpearl shaped, closed capsules , which consist of gelatine and s.g. glycerine, or in the preparation of similar closed capsules, the active compound is mixed with a vegetable oil, Hard gelatins capsules may contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid, pulverulent carrier as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch as e.g. potatoe starch, corn starch or amylopectin , cellulose derivatives or gelatine.Dosage units for rectal administration may be prepared in the form of suppositories, which contain the active substance in a mixture with a neutral fat base, or they may be prepared in the form of gelatins rectal capsules which contain the active substance in a mixture with a vegetable oil or paraffin oil.Liquid preparations for oral administration may be present in the form of sirups or suspensions, e.g. solutions containing from about 0,2 by weight to about 20 by weight of the active substance described, wherein the reminder consists of sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol.If desired, such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine, and carboxymethyl cellulose as a thickening agent. Solutions for parenteral administration by injection may be prepared as an aqueous solution of a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active compound , preferably in a concentration from about 0,5 by weight to about 10 by weight. These solutions may also contain stabilizing agents and or buffering agents and may suitably be available in different dosage unit ampoules.The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable tablets for peroral use is carried out in accordance with the following method The solid substances included are ground or sieved to a certain particle size. The binding agent is homogenized and suspended in a certain amount of solvent. The therapeutic compound and necessary auxiliary agents are mixed with continuous and constant mixing with the binding agent solution and are moistened so that the suspension is uniformly dispersed throughout the mass without overmoistening any parts. The amount of solvent is usually so adjusted that the mass obtains a consist ency reminiscent of wet snow.The moistening of the pulverulent mixture with the binding agent solution causes the particles to aggregate slightly and the granulating process is carried out in such 2 way that the mass is pressed through a sieve in the form of a mesh of stainless steel having a mesh size of about 1 mm. The mass is then placed in thin layers on a tray to be dried in a drying cabinet. This drying takes place during 10 hours end has to be standardized carefully since the dampness of the granulate is of utmost importance for the following process and for the feature of the tablets. Orying in a fluid bed may possibly be used. In this case the mass is not put on a tray but is poured into a container having a mesh bottom. After the drying step the granules are sieved so that the desired particle size is obtained. Under certain circumstances powder has to be removed. To this penultimate mixture, disintegrating, antifriction agents and antiadhesive agents are added. After this mixture the mass shall have the proper composition for the tab letting step.The clsaned tablet punching machine is provided with a certain set of punches and dies, whereupon the suitable adjustment for the weight of the tablets and the degree of compression is tested out. The weight of the tablet is decisive for the size of the dose in each tablet and is calculated starting from the amount of therapeutic agent in the granules. The degree of compression affects the size of the tablet, its strength and its ability of disintegrate in water. Especially with regard to the two later properties the choice of compression pressure 0,5 to 5 ton requires a compromise. When the right adjustment is set, the preparation of tablets is started and is carried out at a rate of 20,000 to 200,000 tablets per hour.The pressing of the tablets requires different times and depends on the size of the batch.The tablets are freed from adhering pulver in a specific apparatus and are then stored in closed packages until they are delivered.Many tablets, especially those which are rough or bitter, are given a coating. This means that they are coated with a layer of sugar or some other suitable coating.The tablets are usually packed by machines having an electronic counting device. The different types of packages consist of glass or plastic gallipots but also boxes, tubes and specific dosage adapted packages.The daily dose of the active substance varies and is dependent on the type of administration, but as a general.ruls it is 100 to 1000 mg day of active substance for peroral administration and 5 to 1000 mg day for intravenous administration.

The antiarrhythmic activities of the compounds have been tested against ouabain induced arrhythmias in anesthetized guinea pigs.MethodGuinea pigs of either sex 300 400 g were anesthetized with urethane 1,4 g kg i.p. and tracheotomized. ECG, lead II was picked up with needle electrodes and was registered continuously throughout the experiment. Two i.v. cathetsrs were inserted one for the administration of ouabain, the other for the test solution.The experimentql design for the study of antiarrhythmic activitis is schematically shown in. the head of Table 2. The arrhythmia was induced by automatic infusion of ouabain, 18 pg kg 60 every two minutes for twelve minutes and thereafter 9 pg kg 30 every two minutes throughout the whole experiment and the infusion was not stopped until asystole occurred. As soon as the frequency of ventricular premature beats VPB had passed 50 per cent, the test solution was given i.v. 0,2 ml min during 2 min. see head of Table 2 . experiments where the test solution contained an antiarrhythmic substance, the frequency of premature yentricular beats was then reduced, but since administration of ouabain continued, the frequency of ectopics increased again. After some time the arrhythmia was converted into bursts of ventricular fibrillation V FIB and finally the animal died.ResultThe results are shown in Table 2, from which it is evident that the new compounds are extremely potent as antiarrhythmic compounds, although their B1 blocking activities intentionally have been made considerably weaker than that of, e.g., propranolol. Thus, looking at the B blocking potency tcf Tabls 1 of the new compounds it is evident that they exert unexpectedly strong antiarrhythmic effects.
