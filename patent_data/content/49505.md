## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED CAPROLACTAM DERIVATIVES, A PROCESS FORPREPARING AND A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAININGTHE SAME, AND INTERMEDIATESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention in its broad aspect relates to caprolactam derivatives which are useful as converting enzyme inhibitors and as antihypertensives.The compounds of this invention can be shown by the following formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, cyclic loweralkyl, amino loweralkyl, alkylamino loweralkyl, hydroxyalkyl, acylamino loweralkyl, dialkylamino loweralkyl including cyclic polyethyleneamino loweralkyl, arloweralkyl, aryl, substituted aryl wherein the substituent is halo, alkyl, aminoalkyl, or alkoxy heteroaryl, heteroarloweralkyl R2 is hydrogen or loweralkyl R3 is hydroxyl, loweralkoxy, or aralkyloxy R4 is hydrogen or loweralkanoyl and, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred are compounds of Formula I wherein RÚ is hydrogen, loweralkyl, aminoloweralkyl, or aryl Rê is hydrogen or loweralkyl R3 is hydroxyl, or loweralkoxy and,R4 is hydrogen or loweralkanoyl. The preferred compounds of this invention also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The products of Formula I and the preferred subgroup can be produced by one or more of the methods and subroutes depicted in the following equations. The definitions of R1, R2, R3 andR4 are the same as in Formula I except where noted. Method A 3 Carboxyperhydroazepine or a 7 substituted derivative II, prepared by the method of P. Krogsgaard Larsen et al. Acta Chem. Scand. B32, 327 1978 is converted to the benzyl ester III by known methods. The t butyl ester could also be used.Alkylation of III with a haloester X Br, I to afford V can be done by known methods, as, for example, in a suitable solvent, such as benzene in the presence of silver oxide. Removal of the benzyl group, B, by hydrogenolysis affords the monoesterVI. Rearrangement of VI under conditions described by H. Rapoport et al. J. Org. Chem., 39, 893 1974 produces the olefin VII. Reaction of this olefin with a thiol derivative VIII, as, for example, thiolacetic acid, gives I. Groups R3 and R4 may be modified by known methods if desired. For example, if R3 OCH3 and R4 CH3CO, the diester I can be converted to the mercapto acid, R3 OH, R4 H , by basic hydrolysis. EMI4.1 EMI5.1 Method B A caprolactam derivative IX, prepared by the method of F. Blicke et al. J. Am.Chem. Soc. 76, 2317 1954 , is reacted with PX5, X C1 or Br to obtain compound X 11. Nagasawa et al., 3. Med. Chem., 14 501 1971 . Reaction of X with haloester IV X Br, I in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydride, and in a suitable solvent, such atTHF or DMF, affords compound XI. Removal of one halogen can be accomplished by using hydrogen and a suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon. The monohalide XII can be reacted with a suitable trivalent phosphorus compound, such as triphenylphosphine, followed by a base, such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the procedure described by G.Howie et al. J. Med. Chem., 17, 840 1974 . The resulting compound XIII is then reacted with an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde, to produce compoundVII, which can be converted to I as described inMethod A. Alternatively, compound IX can be converted directly to monohalide XIV H. Nagasawa et al., above and alkylated with IV as described underMethod A to give XII. EMI7.1 Also, alternatively, compound XI can be hydrolyzed to a ketolactam XIV which can be reacted with an appropriate Wittig reagent CH2 P C6H5 3 to obtain the compound VII. This then can be reacted with the thiol compound R4SH as beforeEMI8.1 The starting materials which are required for the above processes herein described are known in the literature or can be made by known methods from known starting materials. In Products of general Formula I , the carbon atoms to which R1 and R2 are attached when these substitutents are not hydrogen and the ring carbon atom to which the fragment R4 S CH2is attached are asymmetric. The compounds accordingly exist in enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The above described syntheses can utilize racemates or enantiomers as starting materials. When diastereomeric products result from the synthetic procedures, the diastereomeric products can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. When racemic products result, they maybe resolved by crystallization of salts of optically active acids or bases or by other methods known in the art.In general, the aminoacid part structure,EMI9.1 and the ring carbons to which R1 and R4 S CH2 in Formula I compounds can be in two configurations S or R and both are herein covered. The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic bases which are also within the scope of the invention. Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g., dicyclohexylamine,N methyl D glucamine, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine and the like. The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are particularly valuable, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product. The salts may be formed by conventional means, as by reacting the free acid form of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus blood pressure lowering results from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensin II related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin.Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension. See, for example, D. W.Cushman et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 . The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzyme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that of Y.Piquilloud, A. Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem.Biophys. Acta, 206, 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidinylleucine is measured. In vivo evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique of J. R. Weeks and J. A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that ofS. Koletsky et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 125, 96 1967 . Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as antihypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, including humans and they can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients animals and human in need of such treatment in a dosage range of 10 to 500 mg per patient generally given several times, thus giving a total daily dose of from 10 to 1500 mg per day The dose will vary depending on severity of disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. It is often advantageous to administer compounds of this invention in combination with other antihypertensives and or diuretics. For example, the compounds of this invention can be given in combination with such compounds as amiloride, atenolol, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothalidone, chlorothiazide, clonidine, cryptenamine acetate and cryptenamine tannates, deserpidine, diazoxide, guanethidene sulfate, hydralazine hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide, hydroflumethiazide, metolazone, metroprololtartate, methyclothiazide, methyldopa, methyldopate hydrochloride, minoxidil, S 1 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl ethyl amino 3 i 4 2 thienyl lH imidazol 2 yl phenoxy 2 propanol, polythiazide, the pivalogloxyethyl ester of methyldopa, indacrinone and variable ratios of its enantiomers, nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazam, flumethiazide, bendroflumethiazide, atenolol, 4 t3 t 2 1 hydroxy cyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinylgpropyS benzoic acid, bumetanide, prazosin, propranolol, rauwolfia serpentina, rescinnamine, reserpine, spironolactone, timolol, trichlormethiazide, benzthiazide, quinethazone, tricrynafan, triamterene, acetazolamide, aminophylline, cyclothiazide, merethoxylline procaine, and the like, as well as admixtures and combinations thereof. Typically, the individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. To illustrate these combinations, one of the antihypertensives of this invention effective clinically in the 2.5 100 milligrams per day range can be effectively combined at levels at the 0.5 100 milligrams per day range with the following comounds at the indicated per day dose range hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg , timolol 5 6 mg , methyl dopa 65 2000 mg , the pivaloyloxyethyl ester of methyl dopa 30 1000 mg , indacrinone and variable ratios of its ernntiomers 25 150 mg and hydroxy yclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinylS propyl benzoic acid 10 100 mg . In addition, the triple drug combinations of hydrochlorothiazide 10 lOQ mg plus timolol 5 60 mg plus converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 2 1500 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus amiloride 5 20 mg plus converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 2 1500 mg are effective combinations to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Naturally, these dose ranges can be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage and, as noted above, the dose will vary depending on the nature and severity of the disease, weight of patient, special diets and other factors. Typically the compounds shown above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as discussed below. About 10 to 100 mg. of a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin and excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, pregelatinized starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc. or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. The following examples are illustrative of the invention and constitute especially preferred embodiments. The preferred diastereomers of these examples are isolated by column chromatography or fractional crystallization.
