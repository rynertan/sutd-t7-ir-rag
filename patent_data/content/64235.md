# FLEXIBLE MAGNETIC DISK CONDITIONER

## Abstract
A system for treating a floppy disk with conditioning fluid in order to clean, lubricate and destaticize the floppy disk is described. The system comprises a means 40, 45 for grasping the floppy disk about its center and rotating it, fluid absorbing pads 44 which are movable into and out of contact with the magnetic surfaces of the floppy disk through the read write openings in the floppy disk envelope 24 and a means 55 for dispensing conditioning fluid to the pads 44 . In a preferred embodiment, electrical signals control the sequence of operations whereby the floppy disk is grasped by a clutch 40 and spindle mechanism 75 and rotated, fluid is dispensed to the pads 44 , and the pads are moved into contact with the surfaces of the floppy disk to treat the disk.
