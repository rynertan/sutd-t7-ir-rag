# Improved steel wire with high tensile strength.

## Abstract
Bending and torsional ductility of high tensile reinforce ment steel wire or cord, especially for rubber products, such as tyres, is improved by taking care that the steel composi tions that are currently used for such application, have an extra low sulphur content, i.e. below 0.015 , preferably below 0.010 .
