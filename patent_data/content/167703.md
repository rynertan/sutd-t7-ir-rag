# A method of homogeneous chemical vapour deposition.

## Abstract
In a method of homogeneous chemical vapour deposi tion in which first 22 and second 20 gases are intermixed at a location 28 in the vicinity of a cool substrate 14 onto which a material is to be deposited, the first gas contains at least one constituent of the material to be deposited and is at a temperature less than its pyrolysis temperature and the second gas is heated 18 to a sufficiently high temperature that the intermixing of the gases causes the first gas to decompose.
