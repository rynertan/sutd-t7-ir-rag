## Description
COATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING A KETIMINE FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to surface coatings containing urethane groups. More particularly, it relates to two component polyurethane surface coatings curable at room temperature. Such compositions provide moisture hardening type coatings which excel.in weather resistance and flexibility and which do not develop coating film defects such as foaming even under an environment of high humidity. The compositions have long pot lives. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Heat curable polyisocyanate compositions provide polyurethanes on curing into decorative and protective coatings, but, especially for large objects e.g., automobile repair, industrial maintenance coatings , it is impractical to subject the coated structure to oven baking to effect good cure. Room temperature curing of polyurethane surface coating is known, in particular polyurethane surface coatings derived from aliphatic isocyanates.However, these are normally of low reactivity so it is difficult to achieve good room temperature cures with coatings containing this class of isocyanates. Moreover, polyurethane coating materials have rather poor weather resistance when aromatic isocyanates are used, and hardening speed at room temperature is slow if aliphatic or alicyclic isocyanates are used for the purpose of improving the weather resistance. Furthermore, if a catalyst is used tc increase hardening rate, reaction between moisture in the air and the isocydnate occurs and coating film defects such as foaming develop, and pot life is shortened. Thus, there is a major need to provide improved compositiors containing a phatic NCO groups. The present invention provides such mproved compositions in a novel manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, in its broadest aspects, a low polymer a , molecular weight preferably between about 400 and 6000, containing an aliphatic isocyanate NCO group or groups, is mixed with b a ketimine of a di or polyamine in a solvent which dissolves both reactants but which, itself, is non reactice to NCO. Thereafter, if desired, a film is cast and the solvent is allowed to evaporate at any desired temperature preferably room temperature, e.g., 20 250C. Then the ketimine slowly liberates di or polyamine, which effects cure and provides for formation of hard, tough, solvent resistant surface coatings. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a moisture hardening type composition, which is obtained by compounding a a polyester polyurethane resin or poly ether polyurethane resin which possesses nonaromatic isocyanate groups and, b a ketimine compound where at least one of the amino groups of a polyamine com pound which contains at least two primary amino groups in one molecule has been blocked by reaction with a ketone. A more particularly preferred embodiment of this invention is a coating composition which is obtained by compounding, a an isocyanate group containing copolymer which is obtained by copolymerizing 2 to 50 mole of a monomer which possesses the structure of general formula,EMI4.1 in the formula, R is hydrogen or an alkyl group, n is an integer of 1 or 2 , any 98 to 50 mole of an ethylenic unsaturated monomer which is copolymerizable with the above mentioned monomer, and, b a ketimine compound where at least one of the amino groups of polyamine compound which contains two or more primary amino groups in one molecule has been blocked by reaction with a ketone. The latter composition possesses a long usable time in a system where water is absent. On the other hand when it has been coated onto the article to be protected, it reacts with moisture from the air and immedi matey undergoes a hardening reaction.. In such compositics there is excellent balance between the usable time and hardening rate and, at the same time, protective filths can be formed which are outstanding in weather resistance and flexibility. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the broadest aspect, polymeric isocyanate a may be any adduct of a di or polyisocyanate, preferably with a stoichiometric insufficiency of a polyol, preferably a diol or triol, or of a hydroxyl containing polymer, such as an acrylic polymer, a polyester, or a polyether reacted with about one mole of a diisocyanate NCO per equivalent of hydroxyl OH s.

The ketimine component b is one wherein at least one of the amino groups of a polyamine compound which possesses at least two primary amino groups has been capped by reaction with a ketone. These can be obtained by effecting dehydration reaction of an aliphatic amine such as ethylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, tetramethylenediamine, 1, 6 hexamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, and diethylenetriamine, alicyclic diamines such as isophoronediamine, 4,4 bisaminomethylcyclohexane, 4,4 diaminodicyclohexylpropane, hydrogenated xylylenediamine, and dipentenediamine, an alicyclic diamine such as a,z,a ,a tetramethylxylenediamine, or a diamine where the amino group is not directly bonded to the aromatic ring, such as a,a,a ,a tetramethylxylylenediamine and xylylenediamine, with a ketone such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone , and isophorone.

The water of reaction was optionally removed, after a few hours of heating the mixture at about 80 C, or, after several days of standing at room temperature, by treatment with a molecular sieve. Prepolymer A A mixture Gf 300.4 g 1.23 moles m TMXDI, 50 g 0.373 mole trimethylolpropane and 0.015 dibutyltin dilaurate on total charge was heated for 4 h at 800C under dry nitrogen, to provide an adduct or prepolymer containing 15.9 NCO. Precolvmer B A mixture of 259 g 1.06 p T XDI, 500 g 0.515 mole poly tetramethylene ether glycol of numberaverage molecular weight 970, and 0.010 dibutyltin dilaurate on total charge was heated. for 4 h at 800C under dry nitrogen to provide a prepolymer containing 5.9 NCO. Examples 1 5 To provide coating compositions, the prepolymers prepared as shown above were diluted with methoxy ethyl acetate solvent and mixed with a ketimine, or for control purposes with the corresponding amine. The ratio of NCO equivalents to amine equivalents actually present in the amine or potentially available from the ketimine was about 1 0.95 in each case. Where the mixture had sufficient pot life, films were cast from it.The formulations used and the results obtained are set forth in Table 1.
