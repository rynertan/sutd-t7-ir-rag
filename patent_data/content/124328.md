# Hydrocracking process.

## Abstract
A hydrocarbon feedstock having a propensity to form po lynuclear aromatic compounds is hydrocracked without exces sively fouling the processing unit by contacting the hydro carbon feedstock with added hydrogen and a metalpromoted crystalline zeolite hydrocracking catalyst in a hydrocracking zone 3 , contacting at least a portion of the resulting uncon verted hydrocarbon oil containing polynuclear aromatic com pounds in an adsorption zone 13 with an adsorbent which se lectively retains polynuclear aromatic compounds and re cycling 16 unconverted hydrocarbon oil having a reduced concentration of polynuclear aromatic compounds to the hy drocracking zone 2 .
