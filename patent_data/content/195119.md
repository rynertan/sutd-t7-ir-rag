# RETICULAR STRUCTURE

## Abstract
The reticular structure comprises a plurality of substan tially rectilinear axis beams 1 having at least one lower bar 2 and at least one upper bar 2 having different length. Each of these beams 1 is articulated to the adjacent beams at the ends of the bar 2 having larger length and the link between the bars 2 having smaller length is obtained for interposition of an intermediate element 9 having a length to be prearranged according to the outline of the structure to be realized.
