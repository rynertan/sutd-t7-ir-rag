## Description
BULKED POLYESTER FIBRE This invention relates to an improved bulked fibre of a polyester end to methods of producing such a fibre. In our Us patent application No 8132250 we have described how self bulking filaments having a rectangular, ie tape, section may be produced by forming the yarn as a plurality of side by side heterofilaments from two different fibre forming polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate end a copolymer of polyethylene terephthalate end polyethylene isophthalate. In the described yawn, a shrinkage differential exists across the filaments and this causes spontaneous bulking of the filaments. Also in European patent application No 81302121.9 we have described a process of melt spin ng a fibre forming thermoplastic polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate in which there is added to the thermoplastic polymer a small proportion of a liquid crystal polymer and the polymers are then melt spun together in intimate mature at a mdn4mnm wind up speed of 1 kilometre per minute. A feature of the process is that there is wind up speed suppression ie the properties of the spun fibre are those that would be obtained from a fibre spun at a lower wind up speed in the absence of the liquid crystal polymer. Furtharmore in UK patent application No 8135250 we have described how the addition of an immiscible polymer to a fibre forming polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate also produces wind up speed suppression. We have now found that blends of a fibre 90rming polyester and either en immiscible polymer or a liquid crystal polymer, when spun at certain hfgh speeds, produce a fibre which bulks spontaneously when heated. According to the present invention we provide a bulked fibre of a fibre forming polyester containing between 0.1 and 10 by weight of either an immiscible polymer or a liquid crystal polymer. We also provide a process of producing a bulked fibre comprising melt spinning a fibre forming polyester to which has been added between 0.1 and 10 by weight of either an immiscible polymer or a liquid crystal polymer, taking up the spun fibre at a minimum wind up speed of 1 kilometre per minute end heating the spun yarn to a temperature at which the yarn bulks spontaneously. The process of the invention is suited to the more common fibre forming polyesters. It is particul ly suitable for producing fibres from those melt spinnable polyesters based on polyethylene terephthalate and containing at least 85 mol percent ethylene terephthalate and preferably at least 90 mol percent ethylene terephthalate. A particularly preferred polyester is polyethylene terephthalate.Alternatively during preparation of the polyester, minor amounts of one or more esterforming ingredients other than ethylene glycol or terephthalic acid or its derivatives may be copolymerised. Sor instance, the melt sizable polyester may contain 85 to 100 mol percent preferably 90 100 mol percent ethylene terephthalate structural units and 0 15 mol percent preferably 0 10 mol percent copolymerised ester units other than ethylene terephthalate.Illustrative examples of other ester forming ingredients which may be copolymerised with ethylene terephthalate include glycols such as diethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, hexamethylene glycol and dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydro terephthalic acid, benzoin acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid. In general any known liquid crystal polymer can be chosen for addition to the fibre forming polyester provided that it can be processed in the same melt temperature rage as the polyester and provided that it does not react chemically with the polyester to cause significant degradation of the polyester during melt processing. Suitable liquid crystal polymers for blemdng with polyethylene terephthalate are copoly chloro 1,4 phegylene ethylene dioxy 4,4 dibenzoate terephthalate CLOTH and a copolymer of 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl end p oxybenzoyl moieties in the molar proportion 2X87B o CO . Also, in general, any immiscible polymer may be added to the fibre forming polyester provided that it can be processed in the same temperature range as the polyester and that it does not cause undue degradation of the polyester during melt processing. By immiscible polymer we mean that at the spinning temperature such a polymer forms with the fibre forming polyester, a two phase melt. Microscopic examination and optical photographs of such a melt show a two phase system in which the immiscible polymer is in the form of circles indicating spherical particles dispersed in the continuous, fibre forming, polymer matrix. Suitable immiscible polymers are polyolefines, such as polyethylene and polypropylene condensation polymers such as polyamides, and copolyamides, for temple polyepsilon caproamide, polyhexamethylene adipamide and the like and polyethylene glycol. The effect of adding a small proportion of an immiscible polymer or a liquid crystal polymer to a fibre forming polyester is to produce wind up speed suppression in the fibres as they are being spun ie the. properties of the spun fibre are those that would be obtained from a fibre spun at lower wind up speed in the absence of the added polymer. The property which is of particular interest is spun yarn boiling water sbrinka4e SYS which, for a fibre forming polyester, is governed by the wind up speed, the SYS wind up speed curve having an inverted U shape. We have found that the effect of the added polymer is to displace the SYS wind up speed curve to the right together with some change of scale. Vasiability results in different parts of the spun fibre having a different equivalent lower wind up speed and therefore different shrinkages. On account of this the fibre bulks spontaneously when heated. Another feature of this variability is that the spun fibres have a rough surface, similar in some respects to natural fibres, which offers advantages from a handle point of view. It will be realised, however, that variability within the spun fibre is probably undesirable in order to achieve satisfactory tensile properties. Accordingly it is necessary that the actual proportion of added polymer used is such that adequate bulk can be achieved without the loss of acceptable tensile properties. The invention will now be described with reference to the following Foamples. In these Examples the polymers which are blended with the fibre formig polymers have a melt viscosity at the spiting temperature which is much lower then the melt viscosity of the fibre forming polymer at the spiting temperature by which we mean that the melt viscosity of the added polymer is less then 25 of the fibre forming polymer. However it should be understood that this invention is not limited to the use of such low melt viscosity additives. I A commercial grade of polyethylene, Alkathene Grade 23, was blended with a commercial grade of polyethylene terephthalate. The polyethylene had a melt flow index of 200 and a melt viscosity of 12 Ns m2 at 104 N m2 and 2800C. The polyethylene terephthalate had a melt viscosity of 320 Ns m2 at 104 N m2 and 28000. 3 by weight of the polyethylene was compounded with the polyethylene terephthalate in an MEM single screw extruder with a 32 1 L D ratio operating at 40 rpm with a feed zone at 230 C, barrel temperatures at 280 C, 270 C, 265 C and 275 C and die temperature 250 C, extruding 3 8 inch diameter lace which was water quenched and cut. This blend polymer was melt spun in a rod spinner through a spinneret having 5 holes, each being of 15 thou diameter, at 40 gns hr hole with no deliberate quenching.After cooling, the filaments so formed were wound up at wind up speeds of from 1 to 5 kilometres per minute without adjustment of spining rate so that the hiper wind up speeds yielded finer filaments. The extrusion temperature was 3000C The spun fibres were immersed in boiling water for a few seconds. Spontaneous self bulking occurred. The relationship between degree of bulk and wind up speed is given in Table 1. As a control the Example was repeated without. the immiscible additive. The filaments produced did not possess self bulking properties.TABLE 1EMI5.1 tb WIND UP SEP SPEED SEP CRIMP SEP FREQUENCY SEP tb SEP k SEP mpm SEP crimps cm tb SEP 1 SEP 14 tb SEP 2.5 SEP 18 tb SEP 3.5 SEP 33 tb SEP 4.0 tb SEP 4.5 SEP 47 tb SEP 5.0 SEP 31 tb EXAMPLE 2 This example is designed to show that the thermal history and temperature of the threadline contribute significantly to the bulk which can be obtained in the spun fibre. The degree of self bulking is increased by factors which produce a colder threadline, such as lower extrusion temperature, reduced throughout per spinneret hole and the use of quench air. The colder threadline activates the polyethylene, presumably by increasing the net viscosity ratio of the polyethylene terephthalate to the polyethylene. A laboratory melt spinner was used with a spinneret having 5 holes each of 9 thou diameter. The wind up speed was kept constant at 4 kilometres per minute. Otherwise the example was identical to w Pmple 1. The results are shown in Table 2.

As a further alternative the spun fibre yarn may be knitted or woven into a fabric which is then heated, for example by immersion in boiling water, to produce bulk in the fibre yarns. It should also be understood that the spun yarns of the invention may be drawn under tension in a conventional manner before they are bulked. On the other hend if the draw ratio exceeds a certain value, the self bulking capacity of the drawn yarns will be diminished. EXAMPLE 3 1 by weight of a polymer capable of forming an anisotropic melt in the temperature range at which the polyethylene terephthalate is melt spun was blended with polyethylene terephthalate. The polymer added was CO, a copolymer of 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl and p oxybattoyl moieties in the molar proportion 27 73, prepared according to Example V of US 4 161 470. It was blended on a BETOL single screw extruder at 2750C, operating at a screw speed of 50 rpm. The extruder screw had a 30 1 t D ratio. The lace was water quenched and then cut with a lace cutter. This blend polymer was melt spun in a rod spinner through a spinneret having 3 holes, each being of 9 thou diameter, at 96 gms hrAiole, with no deliberate quenching. The extrusion temperature was 300 C. The spun fibres were immersed in boiling water for a few seconds. Spontaneous self bulking occurred. The relationship between average degree of bulk and wind up speed is given in Table 3. The degree of bulk was variable, and the amplitude of the most highly bulked, very high frequency sections was very low, of the order of a few fibre diameters.TABLE 3EMI7.1 tb WIND UP SEP SPEED SEP CRIMP SEP FREQUENCY SEP tb SEP K SEP mpm SEP crimps cm SEP tb SEP 4 SEP 74 tb SEP 5 SEP 57 tb
