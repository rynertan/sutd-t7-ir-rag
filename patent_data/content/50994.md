# A viscosity index improver, a process for making a viscosity index improver, and a lubricating oil composition containing the same.

## Abstract
Lubricating oil dispersant viscosity index improvers may be made by grafting, for example, maleic anhydride to an ethylene α olefin copolymer in a hydrogen treated mineral oil solvent using a free radical and then reacting the grafted intermediate with an amine having the structure R NH CH₂CH₂CH₂ The invention includes a lubricating oil composition containing a viscosity index improver made as above.
