# Sample volume metering apparatus.

## Abstract
A manometer 10 is provided for metering samples of fluid flowing in devices wherein particle concentration in the fluid is being counted or measured. Such devices include particle counters for determining blood cell concentration in body fluid. The device includes low permeable stretchable diaphragms 18 70 in the device connections for containing the mercury therein, and a slide valve 66 in the vent connection to restrict the movement of the mercury during storage or shipment. The arrangement herein includes, also, a one way valve 54 downstream of the stop point to stop flow substantially immediately upon the cessation of the measurement interval to reduce unwanted airflow to the counting aperture. A start and stop arrangement 34, 36 in the mercury flow path for causing the leading edge of the mercury meniscus at the axis thereof to engage the elec trode contacts includes simple wire tips extending into the mercury flow path to the axis thereof for engaging the axis of the mercury meniscus. A preset fixed sample volume metering chamber 32 is provided which eliminates the need for calibration.
