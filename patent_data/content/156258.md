# Light guide member for radiation image read out.

## Abstract
A light guide member comprises three optical blocks. The first optical block is provided with a light input face positioned close to and approximately in parallel with a stimulable phos phor sheet carrying a radiation image stored therein, and a light output face parallel with the light input face. The second optical block is provided with a light input face slightly spaced apart from the light output face of the first optical block, a dichroic optical plane extending upward from one end of the light input face at an angle of approximately 45 , and a light output face extending downward from an upper end of the dichroic optical plane. The dichroic optical plane transmits stimulating rays and reflects light emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet upon exposure to stimulating rays. The third optical block is provided with a light input face slightly spaced apart from the light output face of the second optical block, and upper and lower total reflection planes extending hori zontally from upper and lower ends of the light input face.
