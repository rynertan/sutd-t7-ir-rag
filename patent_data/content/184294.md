# Polyolefin composition and method of coating molded article obtained therefrom.

## Abstract
A polyolefin composition is a blend of, by weight 1 99.9 30 parts of a polyolefin e.g. polyethylene or an ethylene propylene block copolymer and 2 0.1 70 parts of a crystalline and or rubbery copolymer of ethylene 10 80 and propylene and optionally an olefin of 4 or more C atoms e.g. butene 1 to which is graft copolymerised an unsatu rated dicarboxylic acid or anhydride e.g. maleic or itaconic . The graft polymerising can be done by reacting the copolymer in an organic solvent with the acid anhydride in the presence of a free radical generator catalyst, e.g. a peroxide. The composition is granulated and molded to shape. The product is spray coated with a urethane which adheres well without an undercoat the surface may however be treated to improve adhesion before coating.
