## Description
A PROCESS AND APPARATUS TO PROVIDE THE APPLICATION OF GLUE ONPRESELECTED ZONES OF PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS .Thi.s i nventi on relates to the technical field of application of glue on printed circuit boards. in order to prepare such Ltoards. to receive the electronic components. At present, electronic components of much reduced size are developed, such. as cfiip, MELF and SOT type of components, hereinafter referred to as mi crocomponents. The application of such microcomponent on such printed circuit hoards. should simultaneously occur at a plurality of preselected zones with a predetermined constant amount of glue.So far the applicati.on of glue on printed circuit boards has been carried out by a s ilk screen process. Thi s system has the disadvantage that the application surface should be perfectly smooth, so that further components cannot he previously mounted thereon.It i s. object of the present invention to provide a glue application allowing to apply a determined amount of glue in preselected zones of a printed circuit boards.According to the. present invention, the. above specified object has been accomplished by providing a means. having push. rods which are partially dipped into a tank containing the glue, then moving said push rods having a drop of glue away from the tank and depositing the drops of glue drawn by said push rods on the printed circuit board A preferred s luti.on of the. invention provides that the means having push rods, hereinafter referred to as, rod carrying unit, and the support of printed circuit boards. are centered relative to one. another eVery time before the glue drop contacts said printed circuit boards Another preferred solution of the invention provides. that the level of the. glue tank. is. maintained constant by means. of a scraper. A specific embodiment provides that the push. rods comprise small cylinders of flat base, preferably having a diameter of 0.6 mm.Another preferred solution of the invention provides that the push rods are fitted i.nto holes. in a drilled plate, said holes forming a reticule corresponding to all the pos.sib e gluing positions, said push rods being provided with a condensed heat abutting against the drizzled plate when a blocking plate is pressed against the ends of the push. rod headsPreferably, the rod carrying unit is mounted on the machine, so that its position is defined by the thrust of springs, whereby in case of cambering of the printed circuit boards or other abnormal event, said rod carrying unit or a part thereof can resiliently move away from the printed circuit board to avoid any breakages.The invention will now he further explai ned in connection with an exemplary embodiment that has been shown in the accompanying drawings , in which Figs. 1 through 5 are all schematic viiws in vertical section s bowing an apparatus accordi ng to the. present invention at its different operating steps, and Fi g. 6 is an enlarged view of a push. rod. Referring to the accompanying drawings, it will be seen that an apparatus according to the present invention comprises a mounting frame 10, having laterally mounted thereon a number of uprights 11 for the side guides 12 to receive the support 13 of the printed circuit board. By means of a block 14 the fixed mounting frame 10 supports a tank 15 containing glue 16. At the top the apparatus i.s. provi ded with. a rod carrying unit 17, in which the push rods 20 are fitted. The rod carrying unit 17 i.s. formed of a side frame 18 providing an inwardly facing abutment 18a for recei.vi ng the plate 19 having the push rods. 20 i.ns erted therein. The side frame 18 is also provided with some holes 31 wi.th abutments 18b for receiving the centering gudgeons 30 having a head 30a bearing on abutment 18b.. The centering gudgeons 30 are urged by springs 32, the other end of which bears against a closure plate 33 secured to side frame 18 by means not shown. The plate 19 is. provided with a plurality of holes 19a arranged .at the intersections. of the reticule corresponding to all the positions that need glue application. Said holes 19a have the. push rods 20 inserted therein, push rods which comprise a head 21 and an end portion 22 terminating at the bottom wi th. a cylindrical zone having a flat base surface 23 Fig. 6 . All the push. rods 20 are held against the plate 19 by a plate 24 which is urged against said plate 19 by spring 25, of whith one end hears against the plate 24, while the other. end bears against the closure plate 33. The centering of the drizzled plate 19 with. plate 24 and clos ure plate 33 ii ob tai fled through pin 34 penetrating into corresponding holes provided in these parts. The printed circuit board 40 is secured to support 13 by means of pegs 41. The support 13 provides centering bushes 42 having a hole 43 with a tapered lead in 44, which bushes are located at the centering gudgeons. 30. In the present exemplary embodiment it was assumed that the rod carrying unit i.s vertically movable through two alternate strokes of different extension, wh.ile the glue tank is stationary and the printed circuit boards are horizontally moved, thus reaching the push rod operating zone. However, it is obvious. that all these movements. are to be considered as relative movements.. The invention wi,l 1 now be further explained by di.sc osi ng the operation process of this apparatus. As it will seen from Fig. 1, at the beginning of operation, the rod carrying unit 17 is. arranged directly over and at some distance from the glue tank 15. The first step comprises, the movement of unit 17 which dips down to reach the tank 15 of glue 16. Its stroke is such that the base surface 23 of push rods 20 is dipped inside said tank, 15 for a predetermined height H. This height H is less than heigfrt A of .the tank As it will be seen from the drawings, the whole unit 17 has lower occupation of space in a plan view than the free space between the upri.ghts 11 of guides 12, so that said unit 17 can insert therein and contacts glue 16. The second operation step comprises the lifting of uni, 17 and sirnultaneous arrival of printed ci.rcui.t carrying support 13 which is moved i.n a horizontal plane, being di.s.placed on said guides. 12 arranged at right angles. to the drawing sheet. At the end of this step, the position of the different parts is that shown in Fig. 3. It will be seen therein that uni,t 17 has taken again the position of Fig. 1. All push. rods. 20 are now provided with a drop of glue of the same size.. The board 13 for printed ci.rcui,ts. has been brought under said unit 17.The next operation step provides another dipping down unit 17..The amount of this dipping down is smaller than the preceding dipping down.This. second stroke. brings the base surface 23, representing the lower end of the push rods, to a distance D from the top surface of the printed circuit board 40, so that the glue contacts. only board 40 and not the push. rods. The length of the centering gudgeon 30 is such. that its lowermost portion, which is suitable to he received in the bushes. 42, contacts hDle 43 before the glue drop contacts the board 40, so as. to. correctly position said printed ci rcui t board 40 relative to said push. rods 20.The. next step of the. process. provides the. return of unit 17 to its primitive raised position. On the printed circuit board 40 the same number of glue drops 25 as the push rods , will remain, and these drops will he of identical size on tie board 40. The glue drop 27 sticked on the push. rods is smaller than the glue drop .26 initially s.ticked on the push rod 20 when the latter had been dipped in the tank 15. The next operation provides the removing of the printed circuit board 40 this. removal may take place concurrently with the lifting of unit 17, so that the step corresponding to Fig. 5 can be eliminated, which. step has. been shown only for better representing the several glue drops on b.oard 40 and push rods, and passing directly to Fig. 1, thus starting a new operating cycle.During the cycle it ii also provided that during the steps.corresponding to Figs. 3 and 4, the glue tank. 15 can be supplied with. new glue, then leveie.d, s o that the glue height A is unchanged.
