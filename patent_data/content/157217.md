# Lube oil ring pump.

## Abstract
A lubrication system for moveable machine parts within a housing have a sump containing a fluid and a rotatable shaft comprising a ring 16 eccentrically encircling and being fric tionally rotated by shaft 14 , ring being at least partially im mersed in sump fluid to carry fluid during rotation for machine parts, a plurality of fluid carrying fins 24, 26 attached to ring 16 to increase the fluid carrying capacity of ring, fins com mencing from each outer edge and extending partially inwardly along the ring with towards each other thereby forming an an nular space 29 between fins and ring, conduit means 30 having an inlet located within annular space for receiving fluid carried in annular space and delivering fluid to moveable ma chine parts and first and second abutments 18, 20 attached to shaft, one on each side of ring and spaced from ring suffi ciently to form an axial gap for a fluid film which transmits rota tional power from abutments to ring.
