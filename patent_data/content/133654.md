# Particle charging and collection system.

## Abstract
A system including a process of and an apparatus for beneficiating a feed coal containing impurities which include pyrite and ash forming minerals, comprising providing a feed coal which has been comminuted to less than a predetermined size, and moving said feed coal by related means into contact with a surface of a solid body at a velocity relative to said surface sufficient simultaneously to further comminute said feed coal so as to increase the number of particles at least 25 percent over the number of particles in the feed coal and thereby to differentially electrically charge the respective coal and impurity constituents to a high level enabling said constituents to be physically separated one from the other substantially immediately upon entering an electric field, and electrical means including one negatively charged and one positively charged electrode for performing said physical separation.
