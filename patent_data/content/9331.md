## Abstract
Imides derived from 2 oxo 3 benzothiazolineacetic acid and butyric acid have been found to be effective as herbicides and plant growth regulants. These imides are compounds represented by the for mula These imides are produced by reacting an appropriate imide with an anhydride in the presence of a catalytic amount of an alkali metal salt.
