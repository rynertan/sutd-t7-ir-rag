# Electrically conductive device.

## Abstract
Electrically conductive device constituted by a male connector 1 comprising two end flanges 4, 5 and an electrically conductive bottom part 3 holding a plurality of a male contacts which are adapted to cooperate with the female contacts 12 of a female connector 8 . When these connectors are interconnected the female contacts are electrically interconnected and a gap 14 between the connectors 1, 8 permits cleaning of these contacts.
