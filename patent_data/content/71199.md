# Isomerization.

## Abstract
A process is provided for the skeletal isomerization of straight chain olefins to branched chain olefins by contact at an elevated temperature with a chlorine or fluorine contain ing compound activated alumina catalyst, the alumina having an average particle size of from about 0.5 10 ³cm to about 160 10 ³cm and from 3 to 9 of the pore volume being attributable to pores having radii from about 100 to about 10,000 Angstroms.
