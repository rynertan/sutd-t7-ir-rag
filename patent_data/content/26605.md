## Description
Title Improvements in and Relating to Building Panels DESCRIPTIONField of invention This invention concerns building panels and specifically prefabricated panels typically used in the construction of factories and warehousesBackground to the invention Building panels for use in the above field are known and typically comprise two skins of metal sheet, typically zinc plated sheet steel which are bonded to opposite surfaces of a layer of thermal insulating material or the like to form a composite sandwich. Systems have been proposed in which the sheets are additionally joined by means of discreet spacer elements which not only serve to separate the two sheets of material by the appropriate distance but also assist in holding the two sheets together on opposite sides of the sandwich and tend to reinforce the bond between the inner material and the two outer skins of metal sheet Structurally, the simple double bonded sandwich without spacers is less strong than the form of construction in which the two outer skins are additionally joined by spacer members but it is less easy to customise cladding panels which incorporate spacers since the spacing between the two sheet steel skins is one of the parameters which has to be varied to adjust the span strength i.e. structural spanning capacity of a panel.To this end a large number of different sizes of spacer would be required to provide a range of panel thicknesses and in practice this is not normally possible from a clost and storage point of view. Consequently, hitherto, cladding panels have tended to be constructed of one or two standard thicknesses and more often than not the cladding used is of far greater strength and weight than is necessary for the particular spans in the building concerned. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved means for fixing together the two skins of a composite cladding panel, so as to readily allow different spacings between the two panels without interfering with the panel surfaces. It is a second object of the invention to provide a panel whose structural integrity is independent of any chemical bond.The invention According to one aspect of the present invention a building panel for cladding comprises inner and outer sheet members having complimentary and aligned channels formed therein and elongate means extending along the line of aligned channels and secured within the channels, at least by means of a mechanical joint, which requires no penetration of a sheet member. The channels may be formed by a deformation of the panels from which the sheet members are formed. This is particularly appropriate where the sheet members are formed from metal panels typically cold rolled steel panels Alternatively the channels may be formed within the thickness of the panels forming the said inner and outer sheet members and this is particularly appropriate where the panels forming the inner and outer sheet members are formed from a plastics material extruded in sheet form. In one preferred form the elongate means comprises a length of wire or strip material bent in a zig zag manner so as to extend diagonally between the two panels forming the inner and outer sheet members, the wire or strip material being secured within the channels at the junctions between the diagonals Where the inner and outer sheet members are metal panels which are deformed at intervals to form parallel ridges on one surface, the ridges defining channels when viewed from the other surface, and where the elongate joining means comprises a length of metal wire bent as previously described, a good mechanical joint can be formed between the wire and the inner and outer sheet members by crimping the walls of the ridges around the bridging sections of the wire received in the channels formed by the ridges. In another embodiment of the invention, the elongate joining member comprises a length of expanded metal or wire mesh which when used to join metal panels formed with ridges defining the channels, can be secured to the panels by suitably crimping the walls of the ridges as previously described. The channels may tp advantage be formed with a restricted entrance slit and the elongate joining means may be formed with a cross sectional shape which can be snap fitted into the channels through the restricted entrance thereto. This is particularly appropriate to a form 4 construction. in which the inner and outer sheet members are formed from panels of extruded plastics material in which channels are pre formed during extrusion, each of the channels being of partly circular or part triangular cross section with the entrance slit being smaller than the maximum dinienSion of the width of the channel In order to reduce the transmission of heat from one sheet member to the other, a low conductivity material may be used such as kevlar,carbon fibre, low conductivity metals such as stainless steel or suitable plastics materials for the elongate joining means. In addition or alternatively a thermal break may be used such as a sleeve of thermal insulating plastics material or the like into which the elongate joining member is fitted before it is pushed into the channels in the sheet members.In this way the elongate joining means is firmly insulated from the inner and outer sheet members. Where the elongate joining means is a deformed length of wire or metal strip, thermal resistance can be increased by increasing the length of the conductive path between the two sheet members by bending the wire at a shallower angle between the bridging sections received in the channels so that a longer length of wire extends between the two sheet members. It will be seen that by using a simple elongate bridging means such as the type described, a panel can be constructed readily from stock material with the desired degree of spacing between the inner and outer sheet members being obtained by appropriately forming the wire or strip material or cutting the expanded metal or woven wire mesh sheeting so as to provide the required spacing between the two sheet members. Where it is not desirable to incorporate thermal insulating material into the channels as a sleeve around the material forming the elongate joining means, the bridging member may be constructed from two parts, one for securing in the channel in one sheet member and the other for securing in a channel in the other sheet member and a joint of thermal insulating material may be formed at the junction between the two parts forming the elongate joining means. This arrangement is particularly suitable when the elongate joining means is formed from bent wire and in this arrangement, two zig zags of wire are used to form a single elongate joining means, the apices of the triangular sections formed by the zig zag bending of the wire being either joined by means of thermal insulating joints to the apices of the adjoining zig zag wire or being received in one or other of the channels in the two sheet members. Where a range of sizes of standard sections typically extruded or cold rolled steel sections are available, these may be used as the elongate joining means and the channels in the inner and outer sheet members may be formed accordingly so as to receive either as a snap fit or as a sliding fit the opposite ends of the standard sections. Where an inter engaging sliding fit is required between the ends of the elongate joining member and the channels in the inner and outer sheet members, and standard sections are not available, suitable joining flanges may be formed by bending opposite edges of an appropriate width of elongate sheet material so as to form triangular cross section end regions to the sheet or the like for fitting into appropriate triangular section channels formed in the inner and outer sheet members Where expanded metal or the like is required for the flange of the joining member, special edge sections may be secured to opposed edges of the expanded metal sheet, the width of the sheet being selected or cut from standard material so as to give the desired spacing between inner and outer sheet members and the edge sections being fitted to the chopped or selected width of expanded metal sheet material.It will be seen that the advantage of the invention is not lost in any of these forms of construction since in each case the joining member is formed from standard material which can be readily worked or cut to length or bent as required to give any desired spacing between the inner and outer sheet members. The sheet members are themselves preferably preformed with the channels at regular spacings. By inserting an appropriate joining member into every pair of aligned channels, so maximum rigidity and structural strength can be built into the panel. Where a standard sheet is used, but less rigidity and or structural strength is required,joining members may be omitted from selected pairs of aligned channels. Thus for example every other pair of channels may be left empty. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanied drawings.In the drawings Fig.l is a perspective view partly cut away illustrating one embodiment of the invention with those parts of the construction not normally visable shown in hidden detail, Fig.2 is a perspective edge view of part of a composite panel constructed as another emDLiment of the invention, Fig.3 is a perspective view of a composite panel of a further embodiment of the invention Fig.4 illustrates four different types of elongate joining member which may be used in the embodiment of Fig.3, Fig.5 is a cross section of part of another composite panel formed as another embodiment of the invention, Fig.6 illustrates by way of a scrap perspective section how a thermal break can be incorporated between an elongate joining member and a sheet member forming one surface of the panel the type shown in Fig.l, Figs 7 and 8 show by means of a cross section a71d a scrap perspective view how a two part elongate joining member can incorporate a thermal break without the need for the arrangement shown in Fig.6 Detailed description of embodiments Referring first of all to fig.l, a composite panel is formed from two metal sheets 10 and 12 each formed with parallel ridges of which one is generally designated 14 in sheet 10 and one is designated 16 in sheet 12. The sheets 10 and 12 are arranged so that the ridges are on the external surfaces of the composite panel and the two sheets 10 and 12 are joined and simultaneously separated by means of zig zag wire joining members.One such member which co operates with the ridges 14 and 16 is indicated by reference numeral 18. The ridges 14 and 16 are formed by deforming the sheet metal 10 and 12 and initially define parallel sided channels into which the wire 18 can be slid . The wire is bent in a zig zag profile so as to have diagonal sections such as 20 and 22 which extend between a bridging section 24 for entering the channel formed by the ridge 16 and two bridging sections 26 and 28 which enter the channel formed by the ridge 14. The number of bends in the wire and the length of the wire is selected according to the size of the panels and the spacing required between them. After inserting the bridging sections 26 and 28 into the channel formed by the ridge 14, the walls of the latter are crimped as shown in Fig.l so as to trap the bridging sections of the wire zig zag in the ridge 14. The bridging section 24 is similarly trapped by crimping the walls of the ridge 16. The result is a very strong panel which can be constructed from standard material and can also, during manufacture, be constructed with any desired spacing between the two inner and outer sheet members formed by the panels 10 and 12. As shown in Fig.2, where the external surfaces of the panels 10 and 12 are to be flat or substantially flat, the ridges such as 14 and 16 can be hidden by bending the sheet material at the bottom of each of the ridges through 900 so as to produce re entrancy on either side of the ridge 14 and thereafter bending the sheet material parallel with the apex of the ridge 14 so as to extend away from the ridge. By doing this on each side of each ridge, so considerably more material is required to produce a given length of panel but the ridges are totally contained within the thickness of the panel so formed. An alternative elongate joining means is shown in Fig.2 thus comprising an expanded metal section 30. This type of material can be procured in sheets or strips and cut either to length or width as required and can thus provide the same degree of flexibility as regards spacing between members 10 and 12 as the bent zig zag wire arrangement of Fig.l. Fig.3 of the drawings illustrates an alternative arrangement in which the panel is formed from moulded cast or extruded sheets 32 and 34 each formed with internally protruding ridges of which one on the panel 32 is denoted by reference numeral 36 and one on the panel 34 is denoted by reference numeral 38. Each ridge defines a channel of triangular cross section into which can be fitted a corresponding triangular section foot 40 in the case of ridge 36 and 42 in the case of ridge 38, the two feet 40 and 42 being formed on opposed parallel edges of a webb 44 The webb may be formed from metal or plastics material or the like. Furthermore, to reduce the weight and quantity of material required the webb may be apertured as denoted by holes 46. This form of construction shown in Fig.3 lends itself to the use of extruded plastics materials but is not limited to the use of such materials. Fig.4 illustrates four different types of foot and webb section which can be used in the Fig.3 embodiment Thus a Y section foot as denoted by reference numeral 48 can be used. Alternatively a solid triangular section foot such as 50. These forms of construction lend themselves to being constructed by means of an extrusion or casting process. Alternatively sheet material such as sheet metal can be bent to form a generally triangular foot 52 and ina composite fourth construction, a webb of expanded metal or perforated plastics material 54 is fitted with elongate feet of which one is shown at 56 along opposed edges. The feet may be extruded plastics or metal sections or may be formed by bending sheet metal as in 52. Fig.5 of the drawings illustrated an alternative arrangement in which the elongate joining means are standard extruded sections typically of plastics or metal of which one is designated by reference numeral 58. Opposed edges of the section 58 are enlarged to form circular section ribs 60 and 62 and these are snap fitted into appropriately shaped elongate recesses formed in ridges 64 and 66 of the two panels 68 and 70 forming the composite panel. Fig.6 illustrates how a thermal break can be introduced into the embodiment of Fig.10 A sleeve of thermal insulating material 72 is fitted around each of the bridges such as 24, 26,28 before these are inserted into the channel formed by the ridges 14 and 16. The walls of the ridges are then crimped around the sleeve of insulating material which forms the required thermal bridge between the conductive wire 18 and the thermally conductive sheet material normally metal forming the plate 10. Figs 7 and 8 illustrate an alternative thermal break.Here the elongate joining means is formed from two zig zagaed profiles each of half amplitude relative to the zig zag of the wire joining member of figure 1, the frequency of the bends being twice that of the frequency of the bends in the wire joining member of Fig.l The bridges at the external edges of the zig zag profile are, as in Fig.l, received in the ridges formed in the two panels 10 and 12 and the other set of bridging sections 74 and 76 as shown in Fig.8 are joined together through a joint of thermal insulating material designated by reference 78. This may be a quick setting resin material having low thermal conductivity or maybe a sleeve having two parallel apertures through which the wire is threaded before it is bent. The invention thus allows a building panel for cladding to be constructed which, since it does not rely on a chemical bond for its strength is not susceptible to fire damage or weakening as a result of ageing or creep.
