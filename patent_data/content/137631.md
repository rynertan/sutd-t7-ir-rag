# Apparatus for automatically producing cable with crimped terminals.

## Abstract
An improved apparatus for automatically producing cable with terminals crimped thereto is disclosed which includes a cable storing section, for storing various kinds of cables, a cable selecting section for selecting a required cable, a cable measuring and cutting section, a cable sheath scraping section for removing insulative sheath at the foremost end parts of the cable, a terminal crimping section having a plurality of terminal pressure connecting machines arranged in line along a conveyor, and a control circuit. The control circuit automatically controls selection of kinds of cables and terminals and their working conditions at every time when operations are achieved in each of the sections. The cable measuring and cutting section is provided with a direct measuring mechanism in which a distance of move ment of the measuring head is measured while it is stretched under the effect of tension. The cable sheath scraping section is preferably provided with a scraping length adjusting mechanism which serves to adjustably determine the length of naked wire portion of the cable at the foremost end parts thereof with insulative sheath removed therefrom.
