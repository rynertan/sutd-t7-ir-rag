# Automatic brake control circuit for aircraft.

## Abstract
A circuit incorporated in a braking system for allowing a pilot to select a desired rate of deceleration and to cause the aircraft, upon landing, to achieve and maintain the selected deceleration rate. Fundamentally, the circuit includes a selector switch 12 for selecting the desired rate of deceler ation and uses a linear decelerometer signal having an output corresponding to the instantaneous rate of actual deceler ation of the aircraft. Comparator circuitry 26, 28 compares the actual and desired rates of deceleration and provides an error signal to high and low rate circuits which charge a storage capacitor 38 which in turn, through a buffer 48 and power drive circuitry 50 , regulates the associated con trol valve. When the difference between the actual and desired rates exceeds a particular level, the high rate circuit 40, 42 controls the charging of the capacitor 38 . The low rate circuit 44, 46 operates when the difference between the actual and desired rates is below the particular level, and is operative to cause the actual rate of deceleration to asymptotically approach the desired rate. There is also included an initialization circuit 56 60 for quickly filling the brake cavities to initiate the braking operation.
