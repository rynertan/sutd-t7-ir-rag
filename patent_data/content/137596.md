# Automatic transmission with venting.

## Abstract
A transmission includes a housing 20 having the interior thereof connected for fluid communication to a vacuum source 14 , such as an engine manifold. A check valve 32 and a regulator valve 36 are disposed between the transmission housing and the vacuum source. The check valve prevents fluid flow from the vacuum source to the transmission, and the regulator valve limits the maximum vacuum that can be drawn in the transmission housing. The normal transmission fill tube opening 42 has installed therein a filter for restricting fluid flow to the interior of the housing and or a cap 44 for preventing fluid flow through the fill tube 40 during normal operation.
