## Description
Dishwasher basketThe present invention refers to baskets to be used in dishwashing machines, in particular machines having at least two baskets, one over the other, a first basket having a front wall which in the operating condition faces toward the machine door and leans out beyond the corresponding front wall of a second basket.In dishwashing machines of the above said type the first and the second basket are different both for the above said reason and for the different kind and shape of the built in holders for the dishes, and for the different arrangement of some auxiliary means, like the brackets with guide rollers, which shall cooperate with corresponding means provided on the lateral walls of the vessel of the dishwashing machine.The manufacturer is therefore usually compelled to provide for two types of baskets having different size and shape, for a certain dishwashing machine outfit.Each different type of outfit, providing for a different arrangement of pottery in the baskets needs the use of a different kind of holders inside the baskets and as a consequence a different shape both of the first and of the second basket.Eventually the manufacturer must provide for the manufacture of many different types of baskets having different size, with increasing manufacturing difficulties and costs. A further disadvantage is given by the fact that the buyer cannot adapt each basket and the related dish holders to his particular needs.The object of the present invention is to avoid the above said disadvantages and to implement a unified basket which may be adapted to the different possible needs.In order to attain the said object the present invention refers to a basket to be used in a dishwashing machine characterized in that it consists of a basic module and a series of additional elements which can be coupled to the basic module in a separable manner in order to adapt the basket to the size of the washing vessel of the machine in the area where the basket has to be located.Particularly the invention refers to a basket to be used in a dishwashing machine having at least two baskets, one over the other, a first basket having a front wall which in the operating condition faces toward the machine door and leans out beyond the corresponding front wall of a second basket. In this case the basket according to the invention is characterized in that the said basic module presents a size which corresponds to the size of the second basket and an auxiliary containing element is provided which may be coupled to the front side of the basic module in order to adapt the latter to be used as the first basket.The said auxiliary containing element is advantageously shaped so as to be used as a cover basket.According to a further characterization the said basic module presents lateral sides which provide for brackets with rollers, coupled to the basket in a separable manner, which bear the guide rollers which cooperate with the relevant guide means located on the walls of the vessel of the dishwashing machine. Of course various kinds of roller brackets are provided in order to adapt the basket so as to be used both as the top basket and as the bottom basket.Eventually various kinds of holders are provided for the dishes, which may be located freely inside the basic module, in order to adapt the basket to the particular kind of pottery to be put in it.Similar holders may be already provided by the manufacturer or may be supplied later to the buyer which may locate they up to his particular needs.Thanks to said features the manufacturer provides only for one basic module of simple and regular shape, and for a series of additional elements to be coupled to the basic module in order to allow it to be used in different cases.It is clear that in this way a greater manufacturing simplicity and a greater cost reduction may be achieved even if complying with different user needs.Further features and advantages of the invention are clear from the following description made referring to the attached drawings, which are supplied only as a not limiting example, and where figure 1 is a schematic cross section view of a known type of dishwashing machine figure 2 is a perspective exploded view of a basket according to the present invention figure 3 shows a detail of a variation of figure 2 figure 4 is an exploded view of a further variation of figure 2 figure 5 shows the basket of figure 4 in the set up condition figure 6 and 7 show two possible variations of the basket according to the invention.Figure 1 shows a dishwashing machine l comprising a cabinet 2 which interiorly delimits a washing vessel 3, closed at its front side by a door 4 bottomly hinged to cabinet 2.Inside washing vessel 3 there are two baskets 5 and 6, one over the other at some distance, to bear the pottery during the washing.Baskets 5, 6 present lateral walls which provide guide rollers 5a, which cooperate in a known in se manner with corresponding guide means hold on lateral walls of vessel 3. Usually top basket 5 and bottom basket 6 have different size and different shape for many reasons.In the case shown as an example in fig. 1, you can see that first of all the bottom basket 6 has a front wall 7, facing the door 4, which in operating condition leans out beyond the corresponding front wall of top basket 5. This is due to the fact that the door 4 has a top area with a thickness A used to locate electric components to control the operation of the machine, and a bottom area with thickness B, less than A, in order to obtain a washing vessel volume as great as possible.As already told in the first part of present description, a further reason for differences between top basket 5 and bottom basket 6 lies in the fact that said baskets usually provide for different kind of pottery holders and for differently shaped and located guide rollers.For instance, in the case of the dishwashing machines presently manufactured by the Applicant, the top basket may provide for holders for dishes, saucers, cups, and glasses, or for cups and glasses only the bottom basket may be left without holders in order to be used for pots or it may provide for dishes holders. Covers are usually located in a small additional basket, inside the bottom basket. Still in the case of dishwashing machines manufactured by theApplicant, the top basket is further different from the bottom basket, having on its lateral walls two series of guide rollers located at different heights see fig. 1 with reference to the basket itself, in order to allow to locate at different height the top basket inside the washing vessel.In fig. 2 the reference number 10 globally indicates a basket according to the present invention. Basket 10 comprises a basic module 11 with a floor 12, a front wall 13, which in operating condition shall face the door 4, a rear wall 14 located oppositely to front wall 13 and two lateral walls 15. Basic module 11 does not provide interiorly any kind of pottery holder. Shape and construction of such a basic module are therefore particularly simple and as a consequence of easy and inexpensive manufacture.On lateral walls 15 of basic module 11 may be snapped brackets with guide rollers of the type indicated by number 16 or of the type indicated by number 17 depending on the fact whether the basket has to be used in the bottom or in the top position in the latter case two series of rollers at different heights are provided for the reasons already explained above .Brackets 16, 17 present rods 18 on which guide rollers 19 are freely mounted.In case the basket has to be used as bottom basket, to basic module 11 is added an additional containing element 20, to be used as covers container, with hooking elements 21 in order to be hooked to front wall of basic nodule 11.In the example shown in fig. 2 the additional container 20 is located externally to front wall 13 and in contact with the latter. Reference number 22 indicates the handle to grasp the additional container 20.In the variation shown in fig. 3 the additional container 20 is shaped so as to ride on front wall 13. In this case additional container 20 has a recess 23 to mount wall 13.Figure 4 shows a further variation the basic module 11 lacks the front wall. In this case lateral walls 15 both show at their front ends a vertical projecting pin 24.Additional container 20 is attached to front side of basic module 11.In this case additional container 20 show at its ends two top tabs 25 with holes 26 to receive pins 24. Additional container 20 has further two top hooks 27 to hook to top edges of lateral walls 15 of basic module 11. Fig. 5 shows the basket in the assembled condition. Should the basket be used as a top basket, the front side of module 11 is completed by a wall 28 with tabs 29 identical to tabs 25, which receive pins 24, and with hooks 27a. Inside basic module 11 are located pottery holders for instance of types indicated by reference numbers 30, 31, 32 in figures 6 and 7. Such holders merely lie inside the basic module otherwise they may be snapped to it and are therefore easily changed with different holders if necessary.It is therefore possible, starting from the same basic module 11 to build a series of different baskets in order to fulfil different user needs.Of course, without changing the basic idea of the invention, it is possible to change the embodiments and the details with respect to the examples supplied, without departing from the scope of the present invention.
