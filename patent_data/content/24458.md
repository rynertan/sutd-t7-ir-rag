## Description
IMPROVED SOLVENT REFINED COAL PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention A need exists to develop a process for producing an upgraded solid material which is solid and or semi solid at rocni temperature from coal and which is capable of later being com bined with a liquid for further uses, such as, for example, as fuel.Since coal reserves represent one of the largest sources of energy supply in the world, much attention has been directed to devising and developing processes for conversion and or upgrading coal. The term conversion , as employed herein, includes processes wherein a solid carbonaceous material, essentially hydrocarbon in nature, such as, for example, coal, as defined herein, is charged, in accordance with tulle proccss defined and claimed herein1 physically and or chernically, to another distinct specie, such as, for exatnple, the change that occurs as a result of the hydrogenation of coal to a liquid.The term upgrading includes processes wherein treatment of the solid carbonaceous material, for example, coal, results in a product having enhanced physical and or chemical properties, such as, for example, where some of the solid carbonaceous material is not liquified during processing but has a lower ash content and is lower in sulfur and nitrogen and or where the liquid or solid obtained is lower in sulfur and nitrogen content. Attempts to provide an effective process for upgrading coal have not been generally successful because of the difficulty of incorporation, cost and amount of hydrogen required to convert coal to an upgraded material. Further, when coal, whether ash containing or deashed, is treated with a catalyst, the result is rapid catalyst aging and a decrease in activity because of excessive coking and or plugging.Additionally, where a solid and or semi solid material at room temperature can be obtained, such product cannot later be readily combined with a liquid for further use, i.e., it is usually burned as solid fuel The present invention overcomes these problems by providing a process for upgrading coal which comprises the steps of 1 subjecting a slurry composed of coal and a solvent containing donatable hydrogen, together with hydrogen, to catalyst free hydrogenation conditions in a first hydrogenation zone to form an intermediate coal solvent slurry 2 deashing said intermediate coalsolvent slurry to form a coal solvent solution 3 subjecting said coal solvent solution to catalytic hydrogenation conditions in a second hydrogenation zone to obtain a product that can be separated at ambient pressure into a a first liquid fraction boiling at a temperature in the range of about 100 to about 3750C, b a second liquid fraction boiling above said first liquid fraction at a temperature in the range of about 200 to about 5250C and c a solid and or semi solid material and then 4 recycling at least a portion of said second liquid fraction to said first hydrogenation zone.2. Description of the Prior Art U. S. Patent No. 3,932,266 to Sze metal discloses a method of effecting hydrogen addition to coal in two stages, with ash being separated between stages, to produce a synthetic crude. The synthetic crude is produced from coal by initially hydrogenating coal in the presence of a solvent and a hydroliquefaction catalyst. The liquid product containing insoluble material from the initial hydrogenation is then deashed using a liquid promoter , and the essentially ash free liquid coal product is then subjected to a second hydogenation in the presence of a catalyst wherein sufficient hydrogen is added to provide a synthetic crude column 1, lines 28 to 58 column 10, lines 24 to 31 and claim 1 .In marked contrast to the present invention, the Sze process consumes greater quantities of hydrogen, does not provide a solvent containing donatable hydrogen for use in the initial hydrogenation and results in rapid catalyst aging in the first hydrogenation. SUjitRY or THE INVENTION We have discovered a unique process for upgrading coal which comprises the steps of 1 subjecting a slurry composed of coal and a solvent containing donatable hydrogen, together with hydrogen, to catalyst free hydrogenation conditions in a first hydrogenation zone to form an intermediate coal solvent slurry 2 deashing said intermediate coal solvent slurry to form a coal solvent solution 3 subjecting said coal solvent solution to catalytic hydrogenation conditions in a second hydrogenation zone to obtain a product that can be separated at ambient pressure into a a first liquid fraction boiling at a temperature in the range of about 100 to about 3750C, b a second liquid fraction boiling above said first liquid fraction at a temperature in the range of about 200 to about 5250C and c a solid and or semi solid material and then 4 recycling at least a portion of said second fraction to said first hydrogenation zone. The coal that can be used herein can have the following composition on a moisture free basis Table 1 Composition of Coal Broad Range, Wt. Preferred Ranee, Wt. Carbon 45 94 60.5 92Hydrogen 2.5 7.0 4.0 6.0Oxygen 2.0 45 3.0 25Nitrogen 0.25 2.5 0.75 2.5Sulfur 0.3 10 0.5 6.0 The carbon and hydrogen content of the coal will reside primarily in benzene compounds, multi ring aromatic compounds, heterocyclic compounds, etc. Oxygen and nitrogen are believed to be present primarily in chemical combination with the aromatic compounds. Some of the sulfur is believed to be present in chemical combination with the aromatic compounds and some in chemical combination with inorganic elements associated therewith, for example, iron and calcium. In addition to the above, coal being treated herein will also contain solid, primarily inorganic, compounds which will not be convertible to product herein, which are termed as ash , and are composed chiefly of compounds of silicon, aluminum, iron and calcium, with smaller amounts of compounds of magnesium, titanium, sodium and potassium. iiie ash content of the coal treated herein amounts to less than 50 weight percent, based on the weight of moisture frce coal, but, in general, amounts to about 0.1 to about 30 weight percent, preferably about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent. Anthracitic, biturninous and subbituminous coal, lignitic materials and other types of coal materials referred to in ASTM D 388 are exemplary of the coal which can be treated in accordance with the process of the present invention to produce upgraded products therefrom. The coal, prior to the use in the process of the invention, is preferably ground in a suitable attrition machine, such as a hammermill, to a size such that at least 50 percent of the coal will pass through a 40 mesh U. S. series sieve. The ground coal is then dissolved and or slurried in a suitable solvent. Any liquid compound, or mixtures of such compounds, containing donatable hydrogen can be used as a solvent herein.However, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons are preferred. By donatable hydrogen it is meant that a compound can, under the conditions of reaction herein, add hydrogen and also release the same. A solvent found particularly useful as a start up solvent is anthracene oil defined in Chamber s Technical Dictionary,MacMillan Great Britain, 1943 , p. 40 as follows A coal tar fraction boiling above 5180F., consisting of anthracene, phenanthrene, chrysene, carbozole and other hydrocarbon oils. Other solvents which can be satisfactorily employed as start up solvents herein are those which are commonly used in the Pott Broche process.Examples of these are polvnuclear aromatic hydrocarhons such as naphthaiene and chrysene and their hou o genated products such as tetralin tetrahydronaphthalene , decalin, etc. or one or more of the foregoing in adr iyture with a phenolic compound such as phenol or cresol. The selection of a specific solvent when the process of the present invention is initiated is not critical since a liquid fraction which is obtained on completion of the defined conversion process will serve as a solvent for the process at equilibrium conditions. The liquid fraction which is employed and formed during the process as described herein is referred to as a second liquid fraction and is produced in a quantity which can be more than sufficient to replace any solvent that is converted to other products or which is lost during the process. Thus, a second liquid fraction formed in the process of the invention is advantageously recycled to the first hydrogenation zone of the process.In a preferred embodiment, the operation can be carried out that all of the second liquid fraction produced is recycled and satisfies the requirements of the solvent needed in the first hydrogenation zone. It will be recognized that as the process continues the solvent used initially becomes increasingly diluted with the second liquid fraction until the solvent used initially is no longer distinguishable from the second liquid fraction. If the process is operated on a semi continuous basis, the solvent which is employed at the beginning of each new period will be that which has been obtained from a previous operation. A slurry composed of coal and a solvent containing donatable hydrogen, together with hydrogen, is subjected to catalyst free hydrogenation conditions in a first hydrogenation zone.The catalyst free hydrogenation conditions are set forth in Table 2. table 2 Catalyst Frce Hydrogenation Coalitions Broad Range Preferred RangeTemperature, C 343 10 399 482Pressure, kPa psiy 3,447 34,470 6,894 13,888 500 5,000 1,000 2,000 Solvent Coal Weight Ratio 0.5 1 10 1 1 1 4 1Hydrogen Coal Feed WeightRatio 0.01 1 0.30 1 0.05 1 0.10 1Hydrogen Gas Purity, mole 85 100 95 97Residence Time, hrs 0.1 to 5.0 0.5to 2.0 kilopascals pounds per square inch gauge By catalyst free 1 it is meant that no external catalyst is added to the first hydrogenation zone however, ash in the coal itself is present and is known to have some catalytic properties.The exact conditions selected depend, for example, upon the particular feed to be treated, the degree of hydrogenation desired, etc. It is economically desirable to use as low a temperature as possible and still obtain the desired results. If desired, unreacted hydrogen can be recovered and recycled. After subjecting the slurry to catalyst free hydrogenation conditions, an intermediate coal solvent slurry having the typical analysis set forth in Table 3 is obtained.

Ash and or other insoluble material can be separated from the intermediate coal solvent slurry by any technique kne a to one of ordinary skill in the art to provide a coal solvent solution, as defined herein, to be essentially free of insoluble material and or ash. Suitable techniques for ash removal, deashing, can include, for example, filtration, filter wash solvent, separation, and centrifugation. The preferred technique for deashing in the present invention is filtration. The coal solvent solution fonned as a result of aeashlng has essentiaj Jy the same analysis as the intermediate coal solvent slurry in Table 3, except the ash has been removed.In one embodiment of the present invention some or all of the ash from the deashing step is recycled to the first hydrogenation zone to enhance hydrogen take up. A coal solvent solution formed as a result of deashing is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation conditions in a second hydrogenation zone. The catalytic hydrogenation conditions are set forth in Table 4.

S. Patent No. 3,840,473. The preferred catalyst is comprised of a hydrogenation component selected from the group consisting of Group VI and Group VIII metals, their oxides and sulfides, supported on a non zeolitic carrier, which catalyst is promoted with a Group IV B metal. The hydrogenation component employed in the catalyst can be one of a combination of the Group VI and Group VIII metals or their oxides or sulfides. We prefer to employ catalysts containing a clbination of Group VI and Group VIII components, and particularly we prefer to employ such components in an atomic ratio of Group VIII metal to Group VI metal of at least 1 0.3, preferably at least about 1 0.5, and more preferably at least about 1 1.0.Generally, we do not employ such catalyst with a Group VIII to Group VI atomic ratio in excess of about preferably an atomic ratio of less than about 1 3.5, and norse preferably an atomic ratio of less than about 1 2.5. We find a particularly preferred catalyst contains the Group VIII andGroup VI metals in an atomic ratio of less than about 1 1.75.Further, the catalysts have a total Group VI plus Group VIII metals content of at least about 5 percent by weight based upon the total catalyst, and preferably at least about 10 percent by weight. As a general rule, we do not employ catalysts contain ing more than about 50 percent by weight metals and usually restrict total Group VI and Group VIII metal content to less than about 30 percent by weight. Preferred catalysts for use in our process can be comprised of combinations of the iron group metals and Group VI metals such 2s molybdenum and tungsten. Of the iron group metals we prefer to employ cobalt and nickel, with nickel being particularly preferred, and of the Group VI metals we prefer to employ molybdenum.Illustrative of particularly preferred catalysts for use in our invention have metal combinations of nickel molybdenum, cobalt molybdenum, nickel tungsten, and nickel cobalt molybdenum. The most preferred catalyst employed contains a GroupIV B metal, i.e., titanium, zirconium, or hafnium. Accordingly, we employ catalysts containing at least 1 percent by weight of aGroup IV B metal based upon the total catalyst and preferably containing at least about 2.5 percent by weight. While there does not appear to be any upper limit on maximum amount of GroupIV B metal which can be employed, there does not appear to be any advantage to employing more than about 10 percent by weight based upon the total catalyst of such metal. Preferably, we employ catalysts containing less than about 8 percent by weight of aGroup IV B metal. Of the Group IV B metals titanium, zirconium and hafnium , we prefer to employ titanium and zirconium, with titanium bei particularly preferre d. Thc carrier or support employed in the catalyst can be any non zeolitic refractory oxide having a surface area in excess of 5 m2 g, such as alumina, silica aluminas, silica gels, acidleached boro siZicate glass and spins, e.g., magnesium alumina ate, magnesium oxide, alumina aluminum phosphates, etc. Preferahly, however, we employ an alumina carrier. The catalyst caii be a variety of shapes and sizes, such as 1 32 inch extrudates, 1 4 inch tablets or 1 2 inch stars or rings. This is not part of the invention and whatever shape or size is most suitable for a given operation can be employed. When treating a coal solvent solution, according to the process of the invention, it is customary to continue the rcaction until the catalyst activity has decreased markedly due to the deposition of ash and or coke or other carbonaceous material thereon In the process of the present invention, the reaction will continue over an extended period of time before regeneration of the catalyst is required. When regeneration of the catalyst becomes necessary, the catalyst can be regenerated by combustion, i.e., by contact with an oxygen containing gas such as air at an elevated temperature usually about 4820C or by any other means generally used to regenerate hydrogenation catalysts. The manner in which the catalyst is regenerated does not constitute a portion of the present invention. Catalytic hydrogenation produces a product that can be separated by any conventional method known in the art, especially by distillation at ambient pressure into a a first liquid fraction boiling at a temperature in the range of about 100 to about 3750C, preferably about 150 to about 3250C, b a second liquid fraction boiling above said first liquid fraction at a temperature in the range of about 200 to about s2soc, preferably about 250 to about 4750C and c a solid and or semisolid material.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODILIENTS The invention will be further described with reference to the experimental data. Activity and aging of the catalysts is indicated by API for a given number of run hours in the examples which follow. API is a gravity measurement hygrometer method ASTM D 287 of the product and is a reasonable measure of catalyst activity, the amount of hydrogen taken up in a given reaction. For example, product CAPI s of 0, 3 and 9 from a 3 API feed showed hydrogen consumptions of 2.6, 5.3 and 12 kmol H2 m3 feed, respectively. Variations between successive API readings during the course of a run would then indicate the amount of catalyst aging. The API measurements were typically made at 71 C 16 C as compared to the more common 160C l6CC to make certain that the product would have a positive value rather than a negative API value. The catalysts employed in the experimental work were prepared by conventional methods. These methods do not constitute any part of the present invention.Example 1 Forming an Intermediate Coal Solvent Slurry An intermediate coal solvent slurry was prepared according to the process as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,341,447 to Bull et al. An ash contianing coal from thePittsburg and Midway Coal Company Colonial Mine was used in the experimental work. The coal had the following analysis Table 8 Ash Containing Coal Analysis Dry Basis wt Carbon 71.8Hydrogen 5.0Nitrogen 1.3Oxygen 7.9Sulfur 3.7Ash 10.3Two separate runs were carried out wherein ash containing coal was dissolved under catalyst free hydrogenation conditions in a solvent, substantially as described in Table 6, as a second liquid fraction , recovered from previous extraction runs in accordance with the present invention under the conditions as set forth inTable 9.

A first liquid fraction was that fraction which boiled between about 191 to about 288 C at ambient pressure in the separation by distillation. A second liquid fraction was that fraction which boiled between about 288 to about 4540C at ambient pressure in the separation by distillation.On completion of the distillation of the two fractions, there remained a solid and or semi solid material. Elemental analyses of the two liquid fractions and the solid and or semi solid material are set forth in Table 12. A small amount of material, about 0 to about 5 percent, usually less than about 3 percent, boiling at a temperature lower than 191oC can be obtained. The amount of such material depends on the process conditions. Table 12 Analyses of Liquid and Solid Fractions wt.

The results of the catalytic hydrogenation are shown inFigure 1. All runs have an increased amount of hydrogen incorporated as indicated by the higher API values as compared to OKAPI values in Table 11. In order of preference a nickeltitanium molybdenum catalyst is more desirable than a nickel cpbalt molybdenum catalyst, although both catalysts are acceptable in the present invention.Example 5 Separation into First Liquid Fraction, Second Liquid Fraction and Solid Material After Catalytic Hydro genation The product of Run No. 7 was subjected to separation by distillation after catalytic hydrogenation into a a first liquid fraction which boiled between about 191 to about 2880C, b a second liquid fraction that boiled between about 288 to about 3860C and c a solid and or semisolid material. An analysis of each of these is set forth in Table 14. A small amount of material, about 0 te about 5 percent, usually less than about 3 percent, boiling at a temperature lower than 191 C can be obtained. The amount of such material depends on the process conditions. Table 14 Liquid Fraction and Solid and or Semi Solid Analyses wt.

Most important, however, the solid material from Run No. 7 in Table 14 is much more suitable for use as a solid fuel for burning or for use as a blending component with other fractions as described in our co pending application, entitled Novel Fuel Compositions Case B , Serial No. 865,607 , filed concurrently herewith.Example 6 NiCoMo Containing Catalyst Figure 1 also illustrated the superior aging characteristics of catalysts containing NiTiMo on alumina over catalysts containing NiCoMo on alumina. In examining the metal loading content of the two catalysts, on a molar basis, it was noted that the NiTiblo containing catalyst has a higher metal loading content. To show that the NiCoMo containing catalyst with the same metal loading content as the NiTiMo containing catalyst produced a catalyst which did not age as well as the NiTiMo containing catalyst, a catalyst containing 3.0 weight percent nickel, 6.0 weight percent cobalt and 8.0 weight percent molybdenum was prepared.This catalyst and the 0.5 weight percent nickel, 1.0 weight percent cobalt, and 8.0 weight percent molybdenum containing catalyst were compared at equivalent conditions 420 C 800 F , 13,788 kPa 2,000 psig , 2.0 LHSV, and 75.2 kmol H2 m3 feed using a feed similar to that described in the previous examples. The results are presented inFigure 2 as Run Nos. 8 and 9. The API values in Figure 2 were taken at a lower temperature, since negative values were not expected. From Figure 2 it can be seen that identical results were obtained.Thus, the metal loading content of the NiCoMo catalyst in the range studied has no effect on the aging of the catalyst.Example 7 Effectiveness of liiW on Alumina Catalyst While the above data demonstrate the use of both a NiCoMo on alumina and NiTi 4o on a lumina catalysts, other catalysts with different metal combinations are also applicable. A 6.0 weight percent nickel and 19.0 weight percent tungsten on alumina catalyst was also employed in the invention herein. Results with this catalyst using the same feed and processing conditions ofRun 7 of Table 13 and Figure 1 are set forth in Table 15. Table 15 Processing with a NiW on Alumina Catalyst Run Time, Hrs. OAPI 710C 160C 16O0F 600F 16 7.0 31 6.4 47 7.3 63 7.0 93 7.0 This catalyst showed hydrogen incorporation as evident from an QAPI increase of from 3 for the feed and to 7 for the product. While the NiW catalyst did not age, it did not have as high an activity level as the NiCoMo or NiTiMo based catalyst. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the invention, as hereinabove set forth, can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and, therefore, only such limitations should be imposed as are indicated in the appended claims.
