# PROJECTOR FOR PRODUCING A LIGHT SPOT OF POLARISED LIGHT FOR BIOSTIMULATION PURPOSES

## Abstract
A projector for producing a uniformly illuminated re mote light spot of polarised light which can be used for biostimulation. The projector comprises a box like housing 1 in which a metal halogen lamp 2 is arranged with upwardly directed diverging beams. A Fresnel lens 3 is arranged in an upper opening of the housing to direct the light beams in a parallel bundle towards a Brewster polariser 4 which is hingedly connected to the upper portion of the housing. The polarised light reflected from the polariser prop agates in a parallel bundle and the beam collimation is sufficiently correct for illumination from distances of up to 3 m.
