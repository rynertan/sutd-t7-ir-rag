# Fuel distribution and metering.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fuel metering and distribution system for an internal combustion engine comprising an open fuel reservoir 18 into which fuel is metered and a set of capillary tubes 20 each extending from the fuel reservoir 18 to a point in an induction manifold adjacent the intake valve of a respective one of the engine cylinders. The fuel may either be metered by a carburettor like arrangement drawing fuel from a float chamber or by means of a single solenoid valve connected between the reservoir and a source of fuel under pressure. The ends of the fine tubes terminate in the fuel reservoir immediately above the fuel level, whereby as the fuel rises, the additional fuel metered into the reservoir is sucked into the fine tubes and transferred directly to the engine cylinders.
