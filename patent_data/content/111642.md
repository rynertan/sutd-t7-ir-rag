# Method and apparatus for measuring a displacement of one member relative to another.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for measuring a minute linear or rotational displacement of a linearly movable or rotary member 20 relative to a stationary member 10 wherein the stationary member 10 is provided with a plurality of photodetectors 11 arranged at regular linear or angular intervals along a predetermined linear or circular length D, and the linearly movable or rotary member 20 is provided with a plurality of narrow slots 21 arranged at regular linear or angular intervals along the same linear or circular length as the above mentioned linear or circular length. The length D on the stationary member 10 is equally divided by n, which is a positive integer, and each of the photodetectors 11 is positioned at one of the dividing points or positions. The length D on the linearly movable or rotary member 20 is equally divided by n m, where m is a positive number sufficiently smaller than n, and each of the slots 21 is positioned at one of the dividing points or positions. The two members 10, 20 face each other across a small gap and are so arranged that when illuminated through the slots 21 , the photodetectors 11 receive successively different amounts of light and consequently produce outputs of successively different levels. When plotted against the successive posi tions of the photodetectors 11 in the linear or circular arrangement the outputs from a wave, the phase of which changes greatly upon minute linear or rotational displace ment of the two members 10, 20 with the slots 21 and photodetectors 11 thereon relative to each other. The linear or rotational displacement is measured by measuring the phase change, and a very high degree of accuracy of measurement is attained by statistically processing the outputs of the photodetectors 11 . The slots 21 and the photodetectors 11 may be replaced by any other suitable elements which interact with each other to produce a variable amount of information.
