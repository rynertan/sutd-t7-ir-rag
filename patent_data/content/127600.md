## Abstract
A device for increasing the oxygen concentration in a subsurface stratum of a thermally stratified body of water. The device comprises a flexible tube 13 , which is surrounded by a flexible shell 12 . Compressed oxygen containing gas is introduced through first nozzle means 29 at the lower end of the tube and through second nozzle means 31 into channel means 34 between the shell 12 and the tube 13 . There is an upward flow of water in the tube and a downward flow in the channel means 34 around the tube.
