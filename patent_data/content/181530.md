## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition. More particularly, it relates to a herbicidal composition comprising as the active ingredients a 2 4 chloro 5 cyclopentyloxycarbonylmethylthio 2 fluorophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H isoindole 1,3 dione hereinafter referred to as Compound I of the formula EMI1.1 and b ethyl 2 4 chloro 6 methoxypyrimidin 2 yl amino carbonyl amino sulfonyl benzoate hereinafter referred to as Compound II of the formula EMI1.2 which exerts a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without causing any material phytotoxicity to crop plants, particularly to peanut and soybean. In recent years, there has been used a great number of chemicals having a herbicidal activity in order to exterminate or control the undesired vegetation of weeds.Since, however, weeds are diversified in kinds and, their growth extends to a long period of time, the herbicidal effects of conventional herbicidal agents are quite restricted in general. In view of such situation, the appearance of any herbicidal agent which exerts a strong herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without any material phytotoxicity to crop plants has been highly demanded. As a result of the extensive study, it has now been found that the associated use of Compounds I and II as the active ingredients produces a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without causing any material phytotoxicity to crop plants, particularly peanut or soybean. In comparison with the sole use cf each of said active ingredients, enhancement of the herbicidal potency on their associated use is remarkable so that the active ingredient may be applied in a smaller dosage. Thus, a clear and definite synergistic effect is observed in the associated use. The herbicidal composition of the invention which comprises Compounds I and II can exterminate or control a variety of weeds, i.e. dicotyledonous weeds such as common lambsquarters Chenopodium album , redroot pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus , field bindweed Convolvulus arvensis , smartweed Polvaonum sp. , common chickweed Stellaria media , common purslane Portulaca oleracea , common cocklebur Xanthium strumariumf, jimsonweed Datura stramonium and velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti , Ipomoea plants such as tall morningglory Ipomoea purpurea , hemp sesbania Sesbania exaltata , prickly sida Sida spinosa , black nightshade Solanum niarum and common sunflower Helianthus annuus , monocotyledonous weeds such as greer foxtail Setaria viridis , southern crabgrass Diitaria ciliaris , goosegrass Eleusine indica , barnyardgrass Echinochloa c us qalli and johnsongrass Sorghum halesense , etc. Particularly, it is advantageous that the herbicidal composition of the invention is useful in simul taneous control of such weeds as velvetleaf and field bindweed which are hardly exterminated. Compound I is known to exert a herbicidal activity EP A 0126419 . Compound II is also known to be useful as a herbicide Australian Patent Application No.15181 83 . However, the associated use o Compounds I and 11 has never been attempted, and the production of said synergistic effect on such associated use has never been expected. The proportion of Compounds I and its as the active ingredients in the composition of the invention may vary within a considerable broad range. Generally, however,Compound II may be used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 part s by weight, preferably of 0.02 to 2 part s by weight, to one part by weight of Compound I . In addition to the above active ingredients, the composition may contain a solid or liquid carrier or diluent. Any surface active or auxiliary agent may be also incorporated therein. Thus, the composition may be formulatex in any conventional preparation form such as emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or suspension. The combined content of the active ingredients in the composi tion may be from 0.5 to 90 by weight, preferably from 2 to 80 by weight. As the solid carrier or diluent, there may be used kaolin clay, attapulgite clay, bentonite, terra alba, pyrophyllite, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcite, wallnutshell powder, urea, ammonium sulfate, synthetic hydrated silica, etc. Examples of the liquid carrier or diluent are aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. xylene, methylnaphthalene , alcohols e.g. isoproparol, ethylene glycol, cellosolve , ketones e.g. acetone, cyclohexanone, isophorone , vegetable oils e.g. soybean oil, cotton seed oil , dimethylsulfoxide, acetcnitrile, water, etc. The surface active agent used for emulsification, dispersion or spreading may be any of the anionic and nonionic type of agents. Examples of the surface active agent include alkylsulfates, alkylarylsulfonates, dialkylsulfosuccinates, phosphates of polyoxyethylenealkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, etc. Examples of the auxiliary agents include ligninsulfonates, sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, gum arabic, CMC carboxymethyl cellulose , PAP isopropyl acid phosphate , etc. Practical embodiments for preparation of the composition are illustratively shown in the followingFormulation Examples wherein part s are by weight. Formulation Example 1 Ten parts of Compound I , 10 parts of Compouna II , 10 parts of synthetic hydrated silica, 3 parts of alkylsulfonate, 2 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate and 65 parts of diatomaceous earch are well mixed while being powdered to obtain a wettable powder. Formulation ExamPle 2 Five parts of Compound I , 20 parts of Compound II , 3 parts of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, 3 parts of CMC and 69 parts of water are mixed and pulverized until the particle size of the composition become less than 5 microns to obtain suspensions. Formulation Example 3 Fourty parts of Compound I , 40 parts of Compound II , 3 parts of calcium ligninsulfonate, 2 parts of sodium laurylsulfate and 15 parts of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide are well mixed while being powdered to obtain a wettable powder. Formulation Example 4 1.5 parts of Compound I , 0.5 part of Compound II , 1 part of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, 5 parts of polyvinyl alcohol and 92 parts of water are mixed and pulverized until the particle size of the composition become less than 5 microns to obtain suspensions. A composition comprising Compound I and Compound II thus formulated is useful for post emergence control of undesired weeds by foliar treatment. The foliar treatment may be effected by spraying the composition containing Compound I and Compound II over the top of plants. The direct application may be also adopted. In order to improve the herbicidal activity, the composition may be used with other herbicides. Besides, it may be used in combination with insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, fungicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, soil improvers, etc. The dosage of the active ingredients may vary depending on prevailing weather conditions, soil involved, formulaticn used, mixing proportion of each active in greaient, crop and weed species, etc. In general, however, the total amount of Compounds I and II are favcred to be within a range of 0.1 to 3 grams per are. In case of the composition being formulated into an emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or suspension, it is normally diluted with water and applied over the top at a volume of 1 to 10 liters per are to the foliage of the crop plants or weeds which germinate or have germinated.The dilution may include, in addition to the above mentioned surface active agent, any spreading or auxiliary agent such as polyoxyethylene resin acid esters, ligninsulfonates, abietic acid, dinaphthylmethanedisulfonates, paraffin and the like. The practical herbicidal activity of the system of the invention will be explained in further detail with reference to the following Test Examples wherein the growth controlling percentage was determined by weighing the aerial parts of the test plants fresh weight and making calculation according to the following equation EMI7.1 Growth SEP z SEP Fresh SEP weight SEP of SEP test tb controlling SEP plant SEP in SEP treated SEP plot tb SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP SEP x SEP 100 tb percentage SEP Fresh SEP weight SEP of SEP test tb SEP SEP SEP plant SEP in SEP untreated SEP plot tb The phytotoxicity to crop plants was visually observed.

Hideo Chisaka Noyaku Jikkenho Agricultural Experimental Method ,Chapter 3 Herbicides, pages 109 116 .Namely, several combinations of the compositions having different mixing ratio of Compounds I and II but exerting the same level of growth controlling effect, for example, 90 growth control, were analyzed and plotted in a graph so as to readily determine a synergistic effect, arithmetic effect or competitive effect. In case of enhancing the synergistic effect, the equivalent efficacy line as plotted is shown below the arithmetic efficacy line. As shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawing wherein the ordinate indicates the dosage of Compound 11 per are and the abscissa indicates the dosage of Compound I per are, the ecuivalent efficacy line e.g. dotted line of 90 growth control of common cocklebur is located under the arithmetic efficacy line e.g. solid line , from which it is presumed revealed that the associated use cf Compounds I and II in certain mixing ratio would ehhance the synergistic effect.
