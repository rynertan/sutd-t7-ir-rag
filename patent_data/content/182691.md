## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED THIOPHENE 2 SULFONAMIDES, THEIR PREPARATION ANDTHEIR APPLICATION AS ANTIGLAUCOMA AGENTS.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel thiophene 2 sulfonamides useful in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure. More particularly this invention relates to compounds having the structural formula EMI1.1 wherein R, X and n are hereinafter defined, as well as the pharmaceutically and ophthalmologically acceptable salts thereof. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions and the use thereof for systemic and ophthalmic use employing a novel compound of this invention as active ingredient for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure, especially when accompanied by pathological damage such as in the disease known as glaucoma.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glaucoma is an ocular disorder associated with elevated intraocular pressures which are too high for normal function and may result in irreversible loss of visual function. If untreated, glaucoma may eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field defects, is now believed by many ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase of glaucoma. Many of the drugs formerly used to treat glaucoma proved not entirely satisfactory. Indeed, few advances were made in the treatment of glaucoma since pilocarpine and physostigmine were introduced.Only recently have clinicians noted that many ss adrenergic blocking agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. While many of these agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure, they also have other characteristics, e.g. membrane stabilizing activity, that render them unacceptable for chronic ocular use. S l tert Butylamino 3 4 morpholino 1,2,5 thiadiazol 3 yl oxy 2 propanol, a ss adrenergic blocking agent, was found to reduce intraocular pressure and to be devoid of many unwanted side effects associated with pilocarpine and, in addition, to possess advantages over many other ss adrenergic blocking agents, e.g. to be devoid of local anesthetic properties, to have a long duration of activity, and to display minimal tolerance. Although pilocarpine, physostigmine and the blocking agents mentioned above reduce intraocular pressure, none of these drugs manifests its action by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and, thereby, impeding the contribution to aqueous humor formation made by the carbonic anhydrase pathway. Agents referred to as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, block or impede this inflow pathway by inhibiting the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. While such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are now used to treat intraocular pressure by oral, intravenous or other systemic routes, they thereby have the distinct disadvantage of inhibiting carbonic anhydrase throughout the entire body. Such a gross disruption of a basic enzyme system is justified only during an acute attack of alarmingly elevated intraocular pressure, or when no other agent is effective.Despite the desirability of directing the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor only to the desired ophthalmic target tissue, no topically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are available for clinical use. However, topically effective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are reported in U.S. Patents 4,386,098 4,416,890 and 4,426,388. The compounds reported therein are 5 and 6 hydroxy 2 benzothiazolesulfonamides and acyl esters thereof. To be an effective and acceptable topical agent, an ophthalmic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor must not only penetrate the ophthalmic tissues to reach the active sites within the eye, but it must also be devoid of those side effects including irritation, allergic reaction and the like which would militate against long term administration.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention have structural formula EMI4.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whereinX is a straight, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon of up to 10 carbon atoms, such asEMI4.2 m is 1 or 2 n is 0, 1 or 2 R is 1 OR1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen, b C14 alkyl, c hydroxy C14 alkyl, d C14 alkoxy C1 4 alkyl, e phenyl, f pyridyl g carboxy C1 4 alkyl, h amino carboxy C1 4 alkyl EMI5.1 7 N R1 2 wherein the R1 groups are the same or different, or can be joined together to form, with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle such as piperidino, piperazino, morpholino, l pyrrolyl, or the like.EMI5.2 10 phenyl, either unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of a hydroxy, b C14 alkoxy, c C1 5 alkanoyloxy, d halo, such as chloro or bromo, e C1 4 alkyl, f NR R , wherein R2 and R3 are independently, i hydrogen, ii alkyl, or iii C15 alkanoyl,EMI6.1 whereinM is an ophthalmologically acceptable cation selected from sodium, potassium ammonium, tetra C1 4alkyl ammonium, pyridinium, imidazolium, pralidoxime, and thiamineEMI6.2 wherein M is as previously defined EMI6.3 wherein R4 is C1 3 alkyl or phenyl C13 alkyl orEMI6.4 wherein R4 is as previously defined, and the two may be the same or different. It is preferred that n 2, i.e. that the 5 substituent be a sulfone moiety. It is further preferred that X be CH2 1 4 and if R is phenyl or substituted phenyl it is preferred that X be CH2 methylene . Specific compounds within the scope of this invention are 5 4 methoxybenzylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 4 hydroxybenzylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 4 methoxybenzylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 4 hydroxybenzylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 2 hydroxyethylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 2 hydroxyethylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 2,3 dihydroxypropylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 2,3 dihydroxypropylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 trans 4 hydroxycyclohexylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 trans 4 hydroxycyclohexylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfon amide 5 2 acetoxyethylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 3 hydroxypropylsulfonyl thiophene 2 sulfonamide 5 3 hydroxypropylthio thiophene 2 sulfonamide The novel process of this invention comprises as the principal step the condensation reaction of a 5 halo l sulfamoylthiophene with a mercaptan of formula R X SH under the influence of a strong base. The reaction may be illustrated as follows EMI7.1 wherein halo is chloro, bromo or iodo, preferably bromo. The thiophene starting material is represented above as a thiophene sulfonamide and is a quite useful reagent. However, the reaction is usually cleaner and better yields are achieved if the sulfonamide group is protected by an easily removed protecting group such as the N,N dimethylformamidine. In other words, the starting material might actually be of structure EMI8.1 The formamidine protecting group is readily removed by treatment with a mineral acid or aqueous base. In the novel process, the mercaptan, the halothiophene and strong base in approximately equimolar amounts are admixed in a polar organic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dimethylsulfoxide, or the like and stirred at about 100C to 1000C for about 0.5 to 3 hours. The preferred laboratory technique is to treat the mercaptan with the strong base at about 100C to 300C followed by addition of the halothiophene with aging at about 100C to 1000C for the requisite time period. Strong bases suitable for use in the novel process include alkali metal hydrides and alkoxides such as sodium, or potassium hydrides, methoxides, ethoxides, isopropoxides, or t butoxides. The sulfides produced by the foregoing process are converted to the corresponding sulfones by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or a peracid such as m chloroperbenzoic acid or Oxone R a Dupont trade name for potassuim hydrogen monoperoxysulfate . Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide is conducted in a carboxylic acid medium such as acetic or propionic acid at about 50 to 1000C for about 0.5 to 8 hours. The oxidation with a peracid is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, butyl acetate, or isopropanol at about 10 to about 400C for about 1 to 24 hours. Clearly the time is not critical and times longer than that necessary to complete the reaction are not detrimental. Another process to prepare those compounds wherein R isEMI9.1 is represented by the following reaction scheme EMI9.2 where R1 has the meanings hereinbefore designated, and X1 is chloro, bromo, iodo,EMI9.3 EMI9.4 Generally equimolar amounts of the thiophene andEMI9.5 are employed, although use of an excess of the more readily available reactant is satisfactory. The reaction is conducted in a suitable, inert solvent such as acetone, dimethylformamide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or benzene and the like with at least an equimolar amount of a hydrohalide acceptor when the acylating agent is an acyl halide or with a carboxylic acid acceptor when the acylating agent is an acid anhydride. Bases such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like may be employed for this purpose. The reaction may be conducted with or without a catalyst at temperatures of from OOC to the boiling point of the solvent used but preferably from about 150C to 500C. When a catalyst is employed, a 4,4 dialkylaminopyridine such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine is preferred.The compounds wherein R isEMI10.1 of this invention are most suitably prepared by reacting a compoundEMI10.2 with an appropriate haloformate, particularly a chloroformate of the formula EMI10.3 or a bis carbonate of the formula EMI10.4 The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, pyridine, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or benzene and the like with at least an equimolar amount of a hydrohalide acceptor. Bases such as triethylamine, pyridine and the like may be employed for this purpose. The reaction may be conducted with or without a catalyst at temperatures of from OOC to the boiling point of the solvent used but preferably from 150C to 500C. When a catalyst is employed, triethylamine or a 4,4 dialkylaminopyridine such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine is preferred. Another process of this invention for preparing the ethers, i.e. R OR1 wherein R1 H, the hydroxy compound is treated with an alkylating agent of formula R1 X2 wherein x2 is a halide such as chloride, bromide or iodide, or other good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate or benzenesulfonate in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, or the like in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably sodium methoxide, at about OOC to 350C, usually about room temperature for about 10 to 30 hours. The O sulfates of this invention are prepared by reacting an hydroxyalkylsulfonylthiophene 2sulfonamide with sulfamic acid in pyridine at elevated temperatures about 500C to the boiling point for about 18to 48 hours to provide the ammonium salt followed, if desired, by titration with hydroxides of the formula MOH to provide the other salts. Similarly the O phosphates of this invention are prepared by treatment of a hydroxy compound with phosphorus oxychloride, an alkyl dichlorophosphate or a dialkyl chlorophosphate in pyridine or similar basic solvent at about 5 to 50C for about 0.25 to 1.0 hour. In any of the foregoing syntheses the sulfonamide group may be protected as an N,Ndisubstituted formamide prepared and removed as described earlier. The novel pharmaceutical formulations of this invention include formulations for systemic administration and ophthalmic formulations designed for topical ocular administration, preferably the latter. The formulations for systemic administration comprise a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of one or more of the novel compounds of this invention. They may be in a form a for oral administration e.g., as tablets, in combination with other compounding ingredients customarily used such as talc, vegetable oils, polyols, benzyl alcohols, gums, gelatin, starches and other carriers dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in a suitable liquid carrier in hard or soft capsules, encapsulated in a suitable material or b for parenteral administration e.g., dissolved or dispersed in a suitable liquid carrier as a solution, suspension or emulsion, or c for transdermal application, e.g. as a patch. The active drugs of this invention are most suitably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as a solution, suspension, ointment, or as a solid insert. Formulations of these compounds may contain from 0.01 to 15 and especially 0.5 to 2 of medicament. They may contain a novel compound of this invention as the sole medicament or may contain as well an effective amount of a ss adrenergic blocking agent such as timolol maleate or a parasympathomimetic agent such as pilocarpine. The two active principles are present in approximately equal amounts on a weight basis. The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the active compound may be conveniently admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical inorganic or organic carrier. Typical of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are, for example, water, mixtures of water and water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols or aralkanols, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum based jelly, ethyl cellulose, ethyl oleate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, isopropyl myristate and other conventionally employed acceptable carriers.The pharmaceutical preparation may also contain non toxic auxiliary substances such as emulsifying, preserving, wetting agents, bodying agents and the like, as for example, polyethylene glycols 200, 300, 400 and 600, carbowaxes 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000, antibacterial components such as quaternary ammonium compounds, phenylmercuric salts known to have cold sterilizing properties and which are non injurious in use, thimerosal, methyl and propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, phenyl ethanol, buffering ingredients such as sodium chloride, sodium borate, sodium acetates, gluconate buffers, and other conventional ingredients such as sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitylate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, monothioglycerol, thiosorbitol, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and the like.Additionally, suitable ophthalmic vehicles can be used as carrier media for the present purpose including conventional phosphate buffer vehicle systems, isotonic boric acid vehicles, isotonic sodium chloride vehicles, isotonic sodium borate vehicles and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert such as one which after dispensing the drug remains essentially intact, or a bio erodible insert that either is soluble in lacrimal fluids, or otherwise disintegrates. Generally, doses of the present compounds of about 0.01 to about 50 mg kg and preferably from about 0.1 to about 20 mg kg of body weight per day may be used. Dosage may be single or multiple depending on the daily total required and the unit dosage.

At the end of the reaction, the pyridine is distilled from the mixture under vacuum at 50 C. The residue is dissolved in water and made basic by addition of concentrated ammonia. The solvent is evaporated. The product is separated from residual ammonium sulfamate by extraction into ethanol.The ethanol extract is filtered and evaporated to give crude sulfate as the ammonium salt.
