## Description
CONTINUOUS WORD RECOGNITION SYStEM Backsraund Of Invention The present invention relates to improvements in recognition accuracy in a continuous word recognition system. Speech recognition is effective as a measure for inputting data and commands to a computer, and many recognition systems have been sold in the past. As a principle of recognition in these systems, a pattern matching process has been widely employed. According to this process, one or a plurality of reference patterns for a word to be recognized are prepared, and comparison is made between an input pattern and the reference patterns and a word belonging to the category of the most similar reference pattern is determined to be a result of recognition.Through this process, a sufficiently high recognition rate has been obtained in the case of recognition of discretely spoken words In the case of continuously spoken words also, they can be recognized according to the principle of the pattern matching process, but in continuous speech there occurs the phenomenon of coarticulation in which physical characteristics of a pattern are distorted due to influence of successively concatenated phonemes. Consequently, the distorted pattern becomes substantially different from the reference pattern of discretely spoken words, and this has resulted in erroneous recognition. Among the current proposed methods as counter mezsure for this problem of .coarticulation , one is a continuous word recognition method making use of demi word pair reference patterns. A detailed description of this method is found in U.S.Patent 4,513,435 entitled SYSTEM OPERABLE AS AN AUTOMATON FOR RECOGNIZING CONTINUOUSLY SPOKEN WORDS WITH REFERENCE TO DEMI WORD PAIR REFERENCE PATTERNS . Ïn this method, a paired pattern of dem words formed by segmenting out a latter half of a given word to a former half of the next word in continuously spoken words is employed as a reference pattern. This demi word pair pattern is characterized in that it contains a boundary between words, that is, a transient portion influenced by coarticulation Accordingly, by preparing demi word pair reference patterns for all the word pairs, it becomes possible to deal with the distortion caused by coarticulation. The demi word pair reference patternn are produced from discretely spoken words and a continuously spoken word series.In the following, the procedure for producing them will be explained . At first, discrete 4emi word pair patterns are produced from discretely spoken words. For all the discretely spoken words, repective intra word central time points are sought, and respective discrete demi word pair patterns are formed of the former half portions and tbe latter half portions with respect to the intra word central time points. Subsequently, continuous demi word pair patterns are produced from continuously spoken words.By carrying out pattern matching between a continuously spoken word series and discretely spoken words for which the intra word characteristic pointn have been determined, the corresponding central time points are sought on the continuously spoken words, and then a BeXment from an intra word central time point of a preceding word to an intra word central time point of a succeeding word is aegmented out to be used as a continuous demi word pair pattern. The continuous demi word pair patterns are produced for all the word pairs. Next, recognition processing through the pattern matching process is effected by making use of the thus obtained discrete and continuous demi word pair patterns as reference patterns.The results of recognition are obtained as a category name series of the reference pattern series for which the maximum similarity was attained. At this time, in order that the concatenation of reference patterns may not become diacontinuous, the pattern matching is effected under automaton control, As described above, the demi word pair reference pattern system has been effective for resolving the problem of coarticulation because the reference patterns can have the phy cal characteristics of the distortion caused by coarticulation at the interface between words. However, among operators and users are inexperienced in the recognition apparatus, there is a large variation in speech, and for some people a sufficient recognition rate is not obtained even with the above mentioned system. For instance, in some cases even the same user uses different modes of speech, i.e., both discrete words and continuous words. In the heretofore known demi word pair reference pattern system, since the intra word central time points in continuous speech were sought by carrying out matching with discrete speech, not only can the correspondence to the time axis not be determined accurately, but also it is doubtful whether the determined intra word central time points are proper or not as central time points.As a result, in some cases, concatenation of reference patterns upon recognition becomes discontinuous1 and erroneous recognition results. In addt tion, in continuous word speech, due to the influences of preceding and succeeding words1 there may occur conversion to a voicele sound or conversion to a nasal sound of a vowel sound and omission of utterance, and sometimes even the same word would result in various different patterns, It is difficult to speak all such pattern variations upon registration.Although cne may conceive of the method of increasing the diversity o patterns by increasing the number of time registration is performed, in that case the registration requires a lot of time and labor. Especially, in the case of beginners who have little experience in the use of the speech recognition apparatus, upon registration they often may be strained and may speak in a monotone mode. Consequently, upon recognition, as the user becomes experienced in speaking, the patterns may become different from those produced at regiatration, sso that erroneous recognition may occur frequently. As described above, in the heretofore known continuous speech recognition system relying upon demi word pair reference patterns, there has beeq a shortcoming that the system cannot be adapted to the diversity of sgeechen and, especially in the case of beginners a high recognition rate has not been obtainable. Summary Of The invention It is one object of the present invention to provide a speech recognition system having a higher accuracy, in which shortcomings in the prior art are eliminated and various modified reference patterns can be prepared so as to adapt to the diversity of speech without increasing time and labor for registration. According to the present invention, there is provided a continuous word recognition system comprising, a fixed pattern stcrrgs means for storing a predetermined fixed pattern for a plurality of words as patterns to be recognized, the fixed patterns being comprised of time erial feature parameters a regiatration pattern storage means for storing registration patterns spoken by a user, the registration patterns being patterns of discretely spoken words and continuously spoken word pairs of said plurality of words a reference pattern production means for producing demi word pair reference patterns each consisting of time serlal feature parameters for a segment in the continuously spoken word pair starting from a first time point of the former word by making Use of a pattern matching method between the pattern of the continuously spoken word pair pattern and patterns consisting of combinations of the fixed patterns and the discretely spoken word patterns, a reference pattern storage means for storing the reference patterns produced in the reference pattern production means, an input pattern buffer means for storing an input pattern, the input pattern consisting of time erial feature parameters of continuously spoken words by the under and a recognition means for recognizing the input pattern as a concatenation of the demi word pair reference patterns by matching the input pattern with concatenations of the demi 5BDrc pair reference patterns stored in the reference pattern storage means According to another aspect of the present invention .ere is provided a continuous word recognition system including further a fixed pattern amendment means for amending at least a part of said fixed patterns based on information obtained in the operation of said reference pattern production means. The system according to the present invention is controllable based on a finite state automaton control. The principle of the present invention is such that possible modified patterns are preliminarily prepared in a fixed pattern storage section. and these patterns hereinafter called fixed patterns are used as supplementary reference patterns In other words, reference patterns are produced from both the preliminarily prepared fixed patterns and the registration patterns spoken by a user, and thereby recognition is effected.The above mentioned principle can be structurally realized by providing a fixed pattern storage section for holding fixed patterns, and a reference pattern production section for producing demi word pair reference patterns including the fixed patterns, Brief Deecription Of The Drawings Figure 1 is a block diagram showing a first preferred embodiment of the present invention Figures 2 and 3 are chXmatic diagrams to be ueed for explaining the principle of segmenting of reference patterns Figure 4 in a block diagram showing a second preferred embodiment of the prevent invention and Figure 5 i a schematic diagram showing amendment to a fixed demi word pair pattern in the second preferred embodiment. Descrirtion Of The Preferred Embodiment One preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in block form in Figure 1. In a fixed pattern storage section 1 there are fixedly held a group of reference patterns. The term reference pattern as used here means speech data of a word which becomes an object of recognition, and in general it is represented by a time series of characteristic vectors. For the above mentioned fixedly held reference patterns hereinafter called fixed patterns , possible modified patterns spoken by those skilled in the art on the basin of knowledge of phonetics or patterns subjected to various modifications which were selected from a group of many patterns are employed.Examples of such modifications include conversion to a voiceless sound, conversion to a nasal sound or omission. Here, as the fixed patterns, discrete patterns are prepared, n and these fixed patterns are designated as Bm, where m designates a spoken word and n represents the number of times it is spoken. The operation of the continuous word recognition system according to the present invention is divided into a reference pattern production mode which demi word pair reference patterns are produced for registration patterns spoken by a user and the fixed patterns, and a recognition mode in which recognition is effected. In the following, description will be made on the respective modes. In the reference pattern production mode, discrete demi word pair patterns are produced from discrete speech, and continuous demi word pair patterns are subsequently produced from continuous speech. Finally, amendment to the fixed patterns is effected. Sere, by way of example, description will be made by selecting numerals as the object of recognition. At first, when speech data Amg m 0,1,....,9 n l of discrete spoken words through 0 through 9 are input, these data are stored as time series of feature parameters in a registration pattern storage section 2. In a reference pattern production section 3, an intra word time point is sought from the discrete speech data held in the registration pattern storage section 2, and the data portion before the intra word time point is sent an a former half pattern into a reference pattern storage section 4, while the data portion after the intra word time point is sent as a latter half pattern into the reference pattern storage section 4.With regard to the method for seeking the intra word time point, the same method as that disclosed in ts above referenced U.S. Patent 4,513,435 can be employed. More particularly, in the case where 3 san in Japanese has been input, one may adopt the method in which a middle point in time of the word time interval is chosen as an intra word time point.This mode is schematically shown in Figures 2 a , b and c .In these figures, the input discrete speech pattern is shown inFigure 2 a , the former half pattern is shown in Figure 2 b and the latter half pattern is shown in Figure 2 c . The obtained former half pattern of 3 is represented by A ,3 , the latter half pattern of 3 is represented by AS 3, , and these are called discrete demi word pair reference patterns. Here, the symbol means blank , and A ,3 can be deemed as a demi word pair pattern for a blank word and a word 3 . Practically, it means that before 3 no word is concatenated.Similar processings are carried out for all the words of the user s discrete spoken words Am , and thereby discrete demi word pair patterns A ,m , A m, , m O,l ,9 are produced. After the demi word pair patterns for the user s speech have been produced, in a similar manner intra word time points central time points are sought also for the fixed patterns Bmn, t O,l...,.. 9 n l in the fixed pattern storage section 1, then they are divided into former half patterns and latter half patterns, and thereby fixed discrete demi word pair reference patterns IB 9,0 , B O, ............ B ,9 , B 0,9 , are produced.In this way, demi word pair reference patterns are produced from both the ueer s discrete pattern and the fixed patterns, and they are stored in the reference pattern storage section 4. After the demi word pair patterns have been produced for discrete speech, two digit continuous spoken words of 00 through gg are successively spoken by a user, and these time series of. feature parameters are stored in the registration pattern storage section 2 similarly to the discrete speech. In the reference pattern production section 3, continuous demi word pair patterns are segmented out of the continuous speech data held in the registration pattern storage section 2. In the case of the two digit continuous speech, the continuous demi word pair pattern consists of a latter half portion of the first digit and a former half portion of the second digit.With regard to the method for segmenting out a continuous demi word pair pattern, the method disclosed in the above referenced U.S. Patent 4,513,435 is employed. In more detail, pattern matching is effected by employing the continuous speech of two digits as an input pattern and by employing a concatenated pattern of discrete demi word pair patterns corresponding thereto as a reference pattern, and a similarity is sought in the case where the optimum adaptation in time has been established. Likewise, a similarity is sought for all the combinations of the demi word pair patterns produced from the user s discrete demi word pair patterns and the fixed patterns, and segmenting is effected for the combination having the largest similarity.What is segmented out is the portion corresponding to the latter half demi word pair pattern .òr the first digit and the former half demi word pair pattern for the second digit. By way of example, description will be made on the procedure for segmenting out a continuous demi word pair pattern 5,8 from continuous speech 5g read five eight , or gohachi in Japanese . The input pattern of 58 is read out of the registration pattern storage section 2, and is sent to the reference pattern production section 3. In the reference pattern production section for the input pattern of 58 , time axis adaptation to concatenated patterns of discrete demi word pair patterns 9,5 , 5, , ,8 , 8, is effected, and the portion coxteeponding .to 5, ,8 is segmented out as a continuous demi word pair pattern 5,8 Here, as the discrete demi word pair patterns needed for matching, besides those produced from the user s own patterns, those produced from fixed patterns can be employed,Figure 3 shows one example of segmenting of 5,8 which was effected by matching between a user 5 own pattern ll5t1 and a fixed pattern S . The method for time axis adaptation is described in detail in the above referenced U.s, Patent 4,513,435, and further explanation thereof will be omitted here. Upon segmenting when there exist a plurality of patterns for one kind of discrete demi word pair pattern as is the case where both the user s own patterns and the fixed patterns are employed, matching is carried out for all combinations of patterns, and s continuous demi word pair pattern is segmented out for a concatenation of discrete demi word pair patterns having the largest similarity. segmenting of continuous demi word pair patterns is effected for all the continuous speeches, and through the same processing as that described above, 100 varieties of continuous demi word pair patterns for 0,0 to 9,9 are produced and stored in the reference pattern storage section 4. Then the reference pattern production mode is finished. In the recognition mode, successive digits ih a multi digit numeral input to a pattern buffer 5 and a concatenated pattern consisting of the demi word pair patterns in the reference pattern storage section 4 are subjected to pattern matching in a recognition processing section 6, and thereby recognition is effected. Upon recognition, control is effected by a finite state automaton so that contradiction may not arise in the obtained result and the concatenation of demi word pair patterns.For instance, a limitation that after the pattern ,3 , the pattern 3,x x ,0,1,2,......9 must be cone concatenated, is imposed. With regard to the construction and operation of the above referenced recognition processing section 6 which carries out recognition processing under control of a finite state automaton and the finite state automaton, they are described in the above referenced U.S. Patent 4,513,435, and further explanation thereof will be omitted here. The result is determined from the demi word pair pattern having the largest similarity among an allowable concatenated series of demi word pair patterns. For instance, assuming that a series of ,7 7,6 6,9 has been obtained, the result of recognition is 76 . Furthermore, according to another feature of the present invention,, prepared fixed patterns are subjected to amendment processing by making use of information of user s speech, and thereby reference patterns more adapted to the user s speech can be obtained. This amendment of fixed patterns is effected by making use of the information of the portion of the registration pattern spoken by a user left after a segment has been segmented out as a reference pattern, that is, the unused portion. This feature can be structurally realized by providing a fixed pattern atnendmsnt section. This forms a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, and it will be explained in the following. Referring now to Figure 4 which shows the second preferred embodiment of the present invention, in which a fixed demi word pair pattern amendment section 7 is additionally provided.Similarly to the fix6t preferred embodiment1 continuous demi word pair patterns are produced as reference patterns, and after they have been stored in the reference pattern storage section 4,Subsequently amendment to the fixed demi word pair patterns is effected in the fixed demi word pair pattern amendment section 7.This processing is considered to be an adaptation processing for amending the fixed demi word pair patterns which were not produced from the user s speech to more adapted reference patterns by making use of the user patterns. The amendment is effected by making uss of the information of the portion corresponding to l5 6, in the case of the example 58 illustrated in Figure 3, By way of example, it is assumed here that the operation of replaclng this unused portion for the fixed pattern is carried out.In Figure S is shown an example of amendment to a fixed detni word pair pattern of F ,5 . This basic concept is such that when a modification similar to a particular fixed demi word pair pattern has appeared in an unused portion of continuous speech the unused portion is employed in place of the corresponding segment of a fixed reference pattern.In other words, explaining in terms of the example shown inFigure 5, the fixed demi word pair pattern B ,5 to be replaced by the unused portion of the continuous pattern is the portion of the fixed pattern the least distance from the continuous pattern matched with the fixed demi word pair pattern upon segmenting.By this processing, the pattern of the portion which was unused and wasted in the heretofore known system, is utilized effectively as a supplementary pattern that can be adapted to the diversity of the user s speech. In this case, the diatance of the unused portion is that held for each one of the matched fixed demi word pair patterns in the segmenting of the continuous demi word pair pattern.Accordingly, at the time point when the segmenting of the continuous demi word pair pattern has finished, a continuous pattern at the least partial distance is sought for each fixed demi word pair pattern and amendment can be effected by making use of the unused portion of the pattern. This operation is carried out for every one of the fixed demi word pair patterns used for segmenting of the continuous demi word pair pattern. As described above, in the second preferred e iodiment, after production of the discrete demi word pair patterns and the continuous demi word pair patterns, amendment to the fixed demi word pair patterns is carried out, and when the amended patterns have been tutored in the reference pattern storage section 4, the reference pattern production mode is finished. While a principle of the present invention has been described above in connection with preferred embodiments of the invention, it is intended that the description of the preferred embodiments should not limit the scope of the present invention.For instance, as fixed patterns, not only discrete speech patterns but also continuous speech patterns can be employed, and in that case it is also possible to carry out amendment to the employed fixed continuous speech patterns, In addition, there is no need to use all of the fixed patterns as reference patterns for the purpose of recognition, but only a part of them could be used. Furthermore, the amendment to the fixed demi word pair patterns need not be replacement, but a method of producing average patterns or weighted average patterns or a method of adding other patterns could be employed. According to the present invention, by holding modified patterns prepared fixedly as reference patterns, it is possible to correctly recognize even a modified pattern which was not spoken by a user upon registration and thereby improve a recognition rate. In other words, if modification of an input pattern is of the same kind as that upon registration, then a correct result can be obtained because the similarity to a user s reference pattern becomes great, and even if it is of a different kind, a similarity to a fixed discrete demi word pair pattern becomes high, and thereby a correct result can be obtained. In addition, upon segmenting a continuous demi word pair pattern, a demi word pair reference pattern can be segmented at correct intra word time points by employing fixed discrete demi word pair patterns also for matching. In other words, in the case where the mode of user s speech is of a different kind between discrete speech and continuous speech, the correspondence along the time axis becomes inaccurate. Therefore, if there is a pattern that is of the same kind as or close to a modification of continuous speech among fixed patterns which consist of various kinds of modified patterns, then an intra word time point can be obtained. accurately by matching with the fixed patterns.Accordingly, errors in segmenting of reference patterns are reduced as compared to the prior art, and therefore, with the effect that the quality of the reference patterns is improved and erroneous recognition is reduced. Moreover, according to the present invention, reference patterns adapted to user speech can be increased without increasing time and labor for registration, because an unused portion of a registration pattern is uti li zed. Accordingly, reliability of recognition is enhanced and the recognition rate is improved. Furthermore, by amending fixed patterns by means of user a patterns, fixed patterns of poor quality, i.e, fixed patterns which are close in distance to a different category and which are liable to induce errors, can be reduced. Therefore, the present invention is advantageous in that erroneous recognition is reduced.
