## Description
Hybrid DNA technology has made polypeptides accessible, which previously could be obtained only realistically by isolation. Where these polypeptides existed naturally in only small amounts, even isolation became problematic. There was no possibility in these situations to provide the materials in even research amounts, so that they could be studied, no less in amounts which might provide for commercial medical applications. The advent of hybrid DNA technology has changed all this. Now, naturally occurring and synthetic polypeptides can be produced employing the mechanisms of cells, particularly unicellular microorganisms, to produce the polypeptide. In producing a naturally occurring polypeptide of interest, there are many steps involved. Initially, one must identify a DNA sequence encoding for the polypeptide. After identifying the sequence, which may be quite arduous, one must establish the correctness of the sequence. Where the sequence is obtained as part of a much larger fragment, the fragment must be further manipulated to provide a polynucleotide which can be successfully employed for the subsequent steps of producing a construct which will provide for the desired expression in a host. An experimental design must be developed based on the codons necessary for expression of the polypeptide and relating the coding sequence to the regulatory and processing signals necessary for expression. The procedural steps will involve various manipulations to provide for the bringing together of DNA fragments from diverse sources which must be correctly oriented and properly juxtaposed to provide for the desired transcriptional regulation and expression of the polypeptide of interest. This frequently involves employing restriction enzymes in the proper order, removal or introduction of restriction sites, joining of the diverse fragments, and isolating the correct construction. Finally, one must establish that the construction is operative in a host to provide the efficient production of the desired polypeptide. Rivier U.S. Patent Nos. 4,336,336 and 4,338,397 describe leader sequences for secretion in prokaryotes. Kurjan and Herskowitz, Methods and compositions are provided for the efficient production of growth hormone release factors which are secreted as matureable or mature polypeptides from a yeast host. The growth hormone releasing factors are prepared in constructs employing the leader and processing signals of yeast secretory signals, where the polypeptide is expressed as a fused protein which is secreted in mature or matureable form. In accordance with the subject invention, polypeptides having the physiological activity, of human growth hormone release factors, are produced. Unless otherwise indicated when referring to growth hormone release factor polypeptide s , it is intended to include not only the naturally occurring mammalian factors, but also fragments or analogs thereof exhibiting analogous biological activity. Procedures are provided for cloning the gene encoding for the growth hormone release factor polypeptides, for preparing constructs for expression of such polypeptides and isolating the polypeptides are precursors to such polypeptides pre polypeptide . Particularly, the subject polypeptides are prepared as a construct where the subject polypeptides are in reading frame with a leader sequence and processing signals, so that the polypeptides or pre polypeptides are secreted into the nutrient medium and may be efficiently isolated. The subject invention involves genes expressing human growth release factor polypeptides, preferably the naturally occurring polypeptides or physiologically active fragments thereof, and novel constructions involving the genes in reading frame with yeast secretory leader processing signals. The constructs will for the most part have the following formula 5 LS PS gene 3 wherein 5 and 3 indicate the coding strand direction LS is leader sequence for yeast derived from any convenient gene secreted by yeast, such as ÿ α factor, ÿ α factor, acid phosphatase, etc. PS is a processing signal which encodes for amino acid sequences recognized by particular peptidases, so that before, during or after secretion, the amino acids are cleaved and removed to provide for the mature polypeptide product, the processing signals may be those associated with any of the polypeptides secreted in yeast, such as the leader sequences indicated above, or may be modified processing signals lacking portions of the processing signal or repeating units and gene is the DNA sequence encoding for a growth hormone releasing factor polypeptide and will be described in more detail subsequently. The secretory leader sequence signal, the processing signal and the gene encoding for the GRF in the same reading frame will define a structural gene encoding for a pre GRF peptide. The GRF gene, when joined to the processing signal sequence, will usually have an overhang which includes nucleotides of one strand at the 3 terminus of the processing signal sequence. Any leader sequence may be employed which provides for secretion. The secretory leader sequence may be a naturally occurring sequence, a fragment of a naturally occurring sequence, a synthetic sequence or combinations thereof. The significant aspect of the secretory leader sequence is its use in combination with the gene, which allows for maturation of the secreted polypeptide. Any processing signals may be employed which permit removal of the secretory leader sequence and Each of the genes for the growth hormone releasing factor polypeptides or fragment thereof having growth hormone releasing factor physiological activity may be derived from the chromosome, from cDNA, or may be synthesized based on a putative amino acid sequence. For the purpose of the subject invention, synthetic sequences are employed which are prepared by combining a plurality of single stranded fragments which have been analyzed and prepared to be devoid of significant stretches of repeating sequences, that is, the absence of repeating sequences of more than 9 bases, preferably of not more than 7 bases. In addition, the sequences are designed, so that restriction endonuclease recognition sites of restriction enzymes which may be subsequently used in the preparation of the expression vector will be absent, preferably there will be not more than one restriction endonuclease recognition site in the coding sequence, more preferably there being no restriction endonuclease recognition site of a known restriction endonuclease. Furthermore, since the expression product is to be prepared in yeast, it is desirable that the codons be those which are preferred by yeast. By being preferred codons is intended the frequency with which a particular codon appears for encoding the yeast glycolytic enzymes. The genes can be prepared by bringing together a plurality of single stranded sequences varying from about 8 to 40, more usually from about 10 to 35 bases, where overlap occurs of at least 5 bases, more usually at least about 8 bases. Desirably, the terminal single strands provide for overhangs or cohesive ends which can be joined to the secretory and processing signals at the 5 end of the coding strand and 3 transcriptional regulatory signals, e.g. polyadenylation signal, transcriptional terminator, etc., at the 3 end of the coding strand. Stop codons for translational termination may also be included in the synthetic sequence or may be present in a different sequence to be subsequently joined to the synthetic gene. Synthetic genes of particular interest have the following DNA sequences In the above constructions, the 5 end overhang provides for binding to a The synthetic gene may be inserted into a construct to produce an expression vector or gene containing sequence having the following formula each of the functional sequences symbolized by the symbols may be separated by extended sequences where such sequences do not interfere with the function of the symbolized sequence P intends the promoter or RNA polymerase binding site ti intends transcriptional initiation regulation site or sequences which includes various DNA sequences associated with the initiation of transcription and processing of the messenger RNA, such as recognition sites for repressors operators , enhancers, activators, derepressors, cap site, or the like, which may be subject to extrinsic regulation by temperature, small organic molecules, etc. LS is a yeast recognized leader sequence including the secretory leader signal, particularly ÿ α factor and ÿ α factor PS is the processing signal s which includes at least two basic amino acids, which may be the same or different, and are lysine or arginine, and may include additional dipeptide sequences, such as glutamine alanine, glutamic acid proline, aspartic acid alanine, or as described further below gene intends a DNA sequence which encodes for a polypeptide of at least about 20, more usually at least about 29, and generally either 40 or 44 amino acids and not more than about 45 amino acids capable of having one or more of the physiological functions of growth hormone releasing factor, more particularly N terminal fragments of less than 45 amino acids tt intends transcriptional termination recognition site or sequences, which includes stop codons, polyadenylation signals, or the like T intends the transcriptional terminator RepS intends the replication system which includes one or more DNA sequences encoding for replication by at least a yeast host and additionally one or more other hosts, particularly prokaryotic hosts, more particularly E. Various processing signals may be employed having at least one dipeptide unit of basic amino acids and usually not more than about three such units, where the basic amino acid dipeptide units may be joined together or separated by one or more, usually two or more amino acids, where the intervening amino acids may be one to three dipeptide units. The basic amino acids are lysine and arginine. Intervening dipeptide units may be X Y wherein X is an acidic amino acid or amide thereof, i.e. asp, glu, asn, and gln and Y is an acidic amino acid or amide thereof or ala or pro. In addition to the sequences described above, other sequences may encode for other structural genes, particularly markers, which are recognized by the host s for the replication system s , which allows for detection of those host cells containing the gene of interest. These structural genes referred to as markers may provide for prototrophy in an auxotrophic host biocidal resistance, such as from antibiotics, heavy metals, or toxins immunity, or the like. One or more markers may be present, usually not more than 3, more usually not more than 2. In preparing the constructs of the subject invention for expression of human growth hormone releasing factor or analogs thereof, the gene may be synthetically prepared by employing single strands as described above, which are combined under ligating conditions, where the sequences require that the single strands align and anneal to provide for the desired coding sequence. In addition, as indicated, the single strands can provide for specific cohesive ends which allow for proper alignment and reading frame with the secretory leader sequence and processing signals and joining to the appropriate transcriptional and translational termination signals. By appropriate choice of the upstream overhang 5 or 3 one can provide for linking of the subject gene to leader and processing signals in proper reading frame. Particularly, with ÿ α factor, the upstream 5 overhang can have a 5 terminal base sequence which provides for a portion of the In addition, the downstream terminus can be chosen to link with an appropriate restriction site overhang, conveniently in the present case The expression vector may have one or more replication systems, particularly where one replication system is for bacteria, to allow for cloning during the construction, while the other replication system is for the host in which the gene is to be expressed. with the ÿ α factor or After each manipulation the resulting construct may be cloned in a prokaryotic host and the desired DNA fragment isolated by restriction cleavage and used for further manipulation. The expression construct or plasmid may be introduced into an appropriate host, such as Various mutant hosts may be employed having desired mutations or hosts may be modified with episomal elements or by integration to impart desirable characteristics. For example, desirable hosts may overproduce particular enzymes, e.g. membrane enzymes involved in processing, such as dipeptides, may provide controllable regulation of particular promoters, e.g. temperature sensitive repression, may have desirable growth characteristics, membrane characteristics, or the like. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation Nucleotide sequences for human growth hormone releasing factors 40 and 44 comprising preferred yeast codons and eliminating extended repeat sequences were devised based on the amino acid sequence described in Rivier The various oligonucleotides joined in accordance with the ligation strategy are shown in Table 1. The completed genes with appropriate flanking nucleotides and the encoded amino acids are as indicated in Exhibit 1. The ssDNA segments were joined as follows 1 nmole of each segment was 5 phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Two hundred pmoles of all the phosphorylated segments were then annealed in a single step as an 30µl pool by cooling from 95 C to 25 C over approximately 1.5 hours. Ligation was achieved in a reaction volume of 30µl containing 3mM ATP, 10mM DTT, 100mM tris HCl, pH 7.8, 10mM MgCl₂, 1µg ml spermidine and T4 DNA ligase. The double stranded fragments resulting from the above reaction mixture were digested with The joining of the synthetic nucleotide sequences encoding GRF, described above, to the sequences encoding yeast α factor, was accomplished as follows. First, a yeast genomic library was obtained by cloning Sau3A restriction fragments of yeast DNA into the BamHI site of the plasmid YEp24. Plasmid pAB101 which contains the yeast α factor gene as a partial Sau3A fragment, was obtained by screening the library with an enzymatically The resulting mixtures were used to transform The two plasmids 5µg each were digested to completion with Plasmid pc1 1 is a derivative of pJDB219, Beggs, Each ligation mixture is used to transform Cultures 100ml for GRF40 and 50ml for GRF44 of yeast strain AB103 ÿ α, In accordance with the subject invention, novel constructs are provided including sequences encoding for growth hormone releasing factor, particularly joined in reading frame with secretory and processing leader signals, so as to provide for secretion of the polypeptide product into the nutrient medium. By virtue of providing for secretion, greatly enhanced yields can be obtained based on self population and subsequent preparative operations and purification are simplified. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
