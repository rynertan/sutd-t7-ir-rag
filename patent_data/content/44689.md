# Process and apparatus for forming ice confection products, and products formed thereby.

## Abstract
A process for preparing an ice confection or other foodstuff with projecting and relatively recessed relief fea tures of its outer surface, characterised by extruding the ice confection or other extrudable edible material from a rotating extrusion nozzle having a cross section with an assymmetrical configuration with respect to the rotation axis, with the extruded material passing from the nozzle immediately into an unconfined space and on to an elongate travelling conveyor which does not share the rotational motion of the extrusion nozzle, thereby to lay down on the conveyor an extended spirally formed extrudate with pro jecting and relatively recessed relief features derived from its extrusion through the nozzle of assymmetrical configuration.
