Ketoconazole is commercially available as an oral antimycotic in Europe and U. S. A. but has a disadvantage of adverse reactions such as hepatic dysfunction U. S. pats. 4,144,346 and 4,223,036 . Further EuropeanUnexamd. Pat. Publn. No. 61835 discloses azole substituted propanols but their utility is directed only to agricultural fungicides. It has been discovered by the present inventors that the novel azole substituted alcohol derivatives I exhibit orally active potent antimycotic activity as well as agriculturally fungicidal activity. Thus the present invention has been established by these findings. The compounds I of the present invention can be prepared through several synthetic routes as shown below. EMI3.1 wherein Hal and X each is halogen, R4 is C1 C5 alkyl, and Q, Rê and R each is as defined above According to the process provided by the present invention, the azole substituted alcohol derivatives I or their acid addition salts are manufactured by a reacting a compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R and R3 each is as given earlier with a compound of the formula Q H III wherein Q is as given earlier in the presence of an inorganic base in a solvent at temperature of from 20 to 1500C or b reacting a compound of the formula EMI4.2 wherein Hal is halogen and R2 and R3 each is as given earlier with paraformaldehyde and a compound of the formula Q H III wherein Q is as given earlier in the presence of an inorganic base in a solvent at temperature of from 0 to 1000C optionally followed by subjecting the resulting compound of the formula EMI4.3 wherein Q, R2, , and R3 each is as given earlier to c acylation, d alkylation, e reduction or e Grignard reaction with a compound of the formula R4MgX v wherein R4 and X each is as given earlier in accordance with procedures already known. Accordingly the ketol Ia is prepared by reacting the oxirane II with an azole III such as lH imidazole or lH triazole in the presence of an inorganic base such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal alkoxide, hydride or hydroxide in a solvent such as hexamethyiphosphoric triamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methanol, ethanol or mixture thereof at temperature of from 20 to 1500C. In case of using lH triazole asQ H III , eventually a 4H l,2,4 triazol4yl. isomer Ia may be produced together with 1H 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl compound Ia but can be separated from the latter in accordance with methods already known, if necessary. A starting oxirane II is prepared in accordance with the following scheme EMI5.1 Thus the active methylene compound VII is allowed to react with bis dimethylamino methane in acetic anhydride at temperature of from OOC to 1200C to give the vinylketone VI Eametani et al., Heterocycles, 12, 933 1979 , which is then oxidized with a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide or a peracid such as performic acid, peracetic acid, pertrichloroacetic acid perbenzoic acid, per m chlorobenzoic acid or perphthalic acid in a solvent such as a ketone e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone , an ether e.g. ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane , a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane , an aprotic solvent e.g. benzene, toluene or a lower carboxylic acid e.g. formic acid, acetic acid at temperature of from 100C to 600C. The oxirane II is also prepared by subjecting the diketone VIII to the oxirane formation reaction, Thus the dike tone VIII is allowed to react with diazomethane in a solvent such as dimethylformamide Eistert et al.,Ber. 91, 2710 1958 or with dimethyloxosulfonium or dimethylsulfonium methylide in the presence of sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide Corey et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 6 1353 1965 . In an alternative method, the objective ketol Ia is also prepared by reacting a haloketone IV with paraformaldehyde and an azole III in the presence of an inorganic base in a solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide or the like at temperature of from 0 to 1000C. The starting haloketone iv is prepared by halogenating a corresponding ketone or ketol M with an appropriate halogenating reagent such as sulfuryl chloride or thionyl chloride with or without solvent e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride at temperature of from 10 to 1200C. EMI7.1 wherein Y is hydrogen or hydroxy and Hal, R and R3 each is as given earlier In an optional process, the ketol Ia thus obtained is then subjected to acylation, alkylation, reduction orGrignard reaction with the compound of the formula R4MgX v wherein R4 and X each is as given earlier in accordance with procedures already known. Thus the acylation is performed using an acylating reagent such as an anhydride or halide of carboxylic acid in the presence of a base such as organic base e.g. pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine or inorganic base e.g. alkali metal hydride, alkali metal alkoxide, alkali metal hydroxide with or without solvent e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide at temperature of from 0 to 1000C. Exemplary acylating reagents are acetic anhydride, methyl chlorocarbonate, propionyl chloride, trifluoroacetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride and p chlorobenzoyl chloride. The alkylation of the ketol Ia is performed using an alkyl halide such as methyl chloride, ethyl bromide, propyl iodide or butyl bromide or dimethyl sulfate in the presence of a base as afore mentioned in a solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, benzene, hexamethylphosphoric triamide or methylene chloride at temperature of from 10 to 1200C. The reduction of the ketol Ia is performed with an alkali metal complex such as sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride or lithium aluminum hydride. This reaction is generally achieved at temperature of from 15 to 1200C in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or the like. The Grignard reaction of the ketol Ia is performed with a compound of the formula R4MgX V wherein R4 and X each is as given earlier in a solvent such as ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at temperature of from 0 to 1200C. The objective compounds I Ia, Ib, Ic and Id have one or two asymmetric carbon atoms and include optical isomers or diasteroisomers. Though they may be generally obtained in the form of a racemate, it can be resolved into its optical isomers or diastereoisomers in accordance with known methods for example, with the aid of an appropriate optically active acid or according to known methods such as fractional crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts obtained. The compounds I of this invention form acid addition salts with an inorganic acid such as hydrohalogenic acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid , sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid and with an organic acid such as acetic acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid, tartanic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid or the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are preferred in the use of oral antimycotics. The compounds I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts possess potent orally active antimycotic activity and may be used as medicaments for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which contain them in association with one or more of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and excipients. Exemplary carriers, diluents and excipients can be organic or inorganic materials suitable for enteral or parenteral administration e.g.water, lactose, gelatin, starches, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, gums, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum jelly, etc. . The pharmaceutical preparations can be made up in a solid form such as tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, granules, powders or suppositories or in a liquid form such as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. The pharmaceutical preparations may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and or may contain conventional pharmaceutical adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers, etc. The dosages in which the compounds I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be admistered can vary depending upon the requirements of the patient and directions of the attending physician.A daily dosage of said compound to a human adult in oral administration is 15 to 2,000 mg and may be administered once or in several divisions.
