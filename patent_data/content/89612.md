# Apparatus for blending solids.

## Abstract
Particulate materials are blended in a vessel provided with a plurality of vertically extending conduits therein. The vessel comprises a downwardly converging frustoconically shaped bottom wall which defines the lower region of the vessel. The conduits are provided with opening within the upper region of the vessel and the lower ends of the conduits extend through the bottom wall, each communicating via a corresponding inclined conduit with a solids outlet at the open bottom of the bottom wall. At least one drain conduit communicates between a corresponding opening in the bottom wall and a corresponding inclined conduit. A baffle is disposed within the vessel separating the upper and lower regions and comprises a downwardly converging inverted generally conical portion spaced above the bottom wall and defining therebetween a downwardly converging annular passage. Various arrangements of positioning and spacing of drain conduits and corresponding openings in the bottom wall are disclosed to improve flow, sampling and blending of particulate materials from the lower region of the vessel.
