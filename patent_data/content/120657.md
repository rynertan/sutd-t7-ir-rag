# Dual function ultrasonic transducer assembly.

## Abstract
A transducer assembly is provided which performs simultaneous imaging and flow measurement. Separate imaging and Doppler transducers are mounted on one face of the assembly. Each transducer type is backed by backing material which provides damping in accordance with the performance criteria of the different transducer types. The transducer types may be mechanically focused in the same direction so that flow measurements are made in the centre of the area being imaged.
