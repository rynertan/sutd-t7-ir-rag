# Anisotropic melt forming polymers containing fumaric acid or substituted fumaric acid.

## Abstract
A polyester or polyesteramide capable of forming an anisotropic melt containing residues derived from dicarboxylic acids, dihydric phenols, hydroxyaromatic acids and aminophenols characterised in that at least 10 mole of the acid residues of the polymer are radicals derived from fumaric acid or a substituted fumaric acid. Preferably at least 10 mole of the residues other than the residues of fumaric acid or substituted fumaric acid are aromatic ring substituted residues. The polyester or polyesteramides of the in vention are particularly suitable for blending with chlo rine containing polymers at concentrations of up to 25 by weight of the polymer blend to improve the process ability of the chlorine containing polymer. A polyester in which the acid residues are entirely aliphatic is particu larly suitable for blending with poly vinyl chloride .
