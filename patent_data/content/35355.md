# Modified aluminium hydrides, their preparation and their use in reducing acetylnaphthalene derivatives.

## Abstract
A modified lithium aluminium hydride type reducing agent is useful for reducing organic compounds having a carbonyl group ketone group of aldehyde group in their structure to the corresponding alcohols. It is obtained by reacting one equivalent of lithium aluminium hydride with one equivalent of an optically active N substituted ephedrine of the formula, The reducing agent is particularly useful for reducing 2 acetyl 5, 8 dimethoxy 3,4 dihydronaphthalene to the corre sponding 2 1 hydroxy ethyl compound, and, by selecting a particular modified aluminium hydride the unsymmetrical ke tone can be reduced to selectively produce either an alcohol in which the asymmetric carbon atom bonded to the hydroxy group is in R configuration or an alcohol in which said asym metric carbon atom is in S configuration.
