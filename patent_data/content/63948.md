# Plug and ball injector valve.

## Abstract
An injector valve 10 for injecting a charge of a sub stance such as a plug or a ball into a flow line 12 . The injector valve 10 comprises a valve cylinder 20 and a piston 18 which is displaceable in the valve cylinder 20 . The valve cylin der 20 has an inlet channel 28 and an outlet channel 30 for connection into a flow line 12 for fluid flow through the valve cylinder 20 between the inlet and outlet channels 28 and 30 . The valve cylinder 20 has a loading port 14 for loading a charge of a substance into the injector valve 10 . The piston 18 has an injection passageway 22 which is positioned for the piston 18 to be displaceable in the valve cylinder between a loading position where the injection passageway 22 is in re gister with the loading port 14 , and an injection position where the injection passageway 22 is in register with the inlet and outlet channels 28 and 30 . An intermediate seal 78 is provided to provide a seal between the piston 18 and the valve cylinder 20 , the intermediate seal 78 being positioned to be between the loading port 14 and the injection passage way 22 when the piston 18 is in its injection position and a pressure balancing cavity area 82 is provided between the valve cylinder 20 and the piston 18 and is positioned to communicate with the intermediate seal 78 when the piston 18 is displaced between its injection and loading positions.
