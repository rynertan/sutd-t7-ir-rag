# Washing machine for a waste container.

## Abstract
A washing machine for a waste container or for any other container of a relatively large size is designed so as to be attached preferably to a vehicle, such as a lorry, for example as a unit with a frame of an exchangeable platform. The washing machine 1 comprises at least one rotable brush 2 , which consists of a tubular brush body 3 , from which the brush fibres project preferably radially, and of nozzle means for spraying the washing liquid onto the object to be washed. According to the invention, for the purpose of moving the brush 2 along a path of movement substantially of a shape of a rectangle or square in the normal plane of the axis 4 of rotation of the brush, the washing machine 1 comprises guide means 5, 6 and a drive gear 7 for moving the brush 2 in the normal plane of its axis 4 in one direction back and forth. The washing machine 1 addi tionally comprises a second sit of guide means 8, 9 and a drive gear 10 for moving the brush 2 in the normal plane of its axis 4 back and forth in a direction perpendicular to the direction mentioned above.
