# Constant frequency generator.

## Abstract
A substantially constant frequency self regulated gener ator produces in one embodiment 120 volts or the like single phase output or in another embodiment 120 or 240 volts or the like single phase output. The generator employs an exciter stator 20 and a stationary rectifier assembly 22 with the former being a six pole exciter stator 20 alternately wound with three shunt poles 38, 39, 40 and three series poles 48, 49, 50 with two separate windings 51, 52 on each series pole. The three shunt windings of 41, 42, 43 of the exciter stator 20 are connected in series making, in effect, one shunt winding 44 . The series circuit consists of two separate windings 51, 52 on each series pole, which are respectively parallel connected and wound on all three series poles 48, 49, 50 . Each series pole then has two separate isolated coils 51, 52 . With the exciter stator there is employed a stationary diode assembly 22 utilizing three diodes 65, 66, 67 as control diodes for the shunt 44 and isolated series windings 51, 52 . A further smaller diode 72 in parallel with the shunt winding 44 discharges the stored magnetic field allowing some current flow during the half cycle when the shunt winding is not energized. In addition, a small slide wire resistor 76 may be employed for no load voltage adjustments.
