## Description
This invention relates to an area cutting method in a numerically controlled machine tool and, more particularly, to an area cutting method for cutting an area delimited by a curve of an external shape and at least two closed curves which lie within the curve of the external shape. Forms of numerically controlled machining include cutting in which the interior of an area bounded by the curve of an external shape comprising straight lines and circular arcs is hollowed out down to a predetermined depth, and die milling in which the interior of an area is die milled. In such machining, as shown in Fig. 1 A , an area cutting method is conventionally carried out by performing cutting along an i 1th cutting path PTi 1 in one direction the direction of the solid line arrow , raising the tool a predetermined amount at the completion of cutting, then positioning the tool directly above a cutting starting point Ps on the next, or i th, cutting path PTi by moving the tool in the direction of the dashed line arrow, thereafter lowering the tool to the cutting starting point Ps, moving the tool along the i th cutting path PTi in the direction of the solid line arrow, and subsequently repeating the above unidirectional cutting. Another area cutting method shown in Fig. 1 B includes, following completion of cutting along the cutting path PTi 1 of the i 1 th cutting path, moving the tool from a cutting end point Pe to the cutting starting point Ps on the next, or i th, cutting path, and thereafter performing cutting along the i th cutting path PTi. Thus, cutting is performed back and forth in the direction of the solid line arrows. There are cases where it is required to cut an area AR shaded portion delimited by a curve OLC of an external shape and a closed curve INC inside the curve of the external shape, as shown in Fig. 2. The reason for example is that it maybe necessary to form bolt holes, which are needed for effecting a connection to another part, in the area hereafter referred to as an island IRD bounded by the closed curve INC, or to hollow out the island IRD to a depth less than that of the area AR by using a different tool. Thus, if the island IRD is present inside the curve of the external shape, the area AR the shaded portion in Fig. 2 delimited by the shape OLC of the external curve and the closed curve INC is cut, in accordance with the conventional method shown in Fig. 1 A or B , by a obtaining intersection points P Area cutting can thus be carried out with the conventional methods even if the island IRD is present. However, the conventional methods cannot be applied as they are if two or more islands are present and the spacing between the islands is small. By way of example, the conventional methods cannot be applied if, as shown in Fig. 4, two islands IRD₁, IRD₂ reside so close together inside the curve OLC of the external shape that offset curves INF₁, INF₂ intersect, the latter curves being obtained by offsetting closed curves INC₁, INC₂, which specify the respective islands, by a predetermined amount D e.g., a value obtained by adding tool radius r Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an area cutting method whereby area cutting can be performed even if two or more islands reside so close together inside the curve OLC of the external shape that the offset curves INF₁, INF₂ of the closed curves INC₁, INC₂ specifying the islands intersect each other. Another object of a first aspect of the present invention is to provide an area cutting method wherein, when two offset curves INF₁, INF₂ intersect each other, these are combined to obtain a combined offset curve consisting of a single closed curve and area cutting is performed upon so arranging it that the center of the tool does not penetrate the interior of the offset curve. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an area cutting method wherein, when two offset curves intersect each other to give rise to a portion which is impossible to area cut, cutting of this portion is omitted and only the remaining area cuttable portions are area cut. Preferably, the curve of an external shape, each closed curve inside the curve of the external shape and offset curves may be displayed on a display unit. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a numerically controlled cutting method for cutting an area delimited by a curve of an external shape and at least two closed curves which lie within said curve of the external shape, these three curves being predefined by an NC machining program, the method comprising a step of calculating offset curves offset outwardly from respective ones of said closed curves by an amount dependent upon tool diameter, a step of checking whether the offset curves intersect one another, a step of ascertaining that a portion incapable of being area cut exists when the offset curves intersect one another, and a step of cutting the area from which said portion incapable of being area cut is omitted, this portion lying within an area bounded between the intersecting offset curves wherein a combined offset curve is calculated which is made up of the intersecting offset curves except for the portions thereof which contain said area bounded between the intersecting offset curves, the area cutting being performed in such manner that the center of the cutting tool does not penetrate the interior of the calculated combined offset curve. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a numerically controlled cutting method for cutting an area delimited by a curve of an external shape and at least two closed curves which lie within said curve of the external shape, these three curves being predefined by an NC machining program, the method comprising a step of calculating offset curves offset outwardly from respective ones of said closed curves by an amount dependent upon tool diameter, a step of checking whether the offset curves intersect one another, a step of ascertaining that a portion incapable of being area cut exists when the offset curves intersect one another, and a step of cutting the area from which said portion incapable of being area cut is omitted, this portion lying within an area bounded between the intersecting offset curves wherein area cutting data is entered necessary for performing area cutting based on undirectional cutting or back and forth cutting and a cutting straight line is calculated, which specifies an i th cutting path PT Figs. 1 A , B are views for describing conventional area cutting methods by unidirectional and back and forth cutting, Figs. 2 and 3 are views for describing a conventional cutting method for a case where an island is present, Fig. 4 is a view for describing the drawback of the conventional area cutting methods where two islands are present, Fig. 5 is a view for describing one method according to the present invention in general terms, Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an apparatus for practicing an area cutting method of the present invention, Fig. 7 is a flowchart of processing for implementing an area cutting method of the present invention, Fig. 8 is a view for describing offset processing, Fig. 9 is a view for describing processing for creating a combined offset curve, Fig. 10 is a view for describing a cutting method for a case where a portion incapable of being area cut does not exist, and Fig. 11 is a view for describing another area cutting method according to the present invention. Fig. 5 is a view for describing one method according to the present invention in general terms. The present invention provides an area cutting method for cutting an area AR delimited by a curve OFC of an external shape and at least two closed curves INC₁, INC₂ which lie within the curve of the external shape. The area cutting method has a step of calculating first and second offset curves INF₁, INF₂ offset outwardly from the respective closed curves by an amount dependent upon tool diameter, a step of checking whether the offset curves intersect each other, and a step of cutting an area from which there has been omitted an area CSA common to an area bounded by the first offset curve INF₁ and an area bounded by the second offset curve INF₂ when the offset curves intersect each other. Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an apparatus for practicing the method of the present invention, and Fig. 7 is a flowchart of processing according to the present invention. The area cutting method of the present invention will now be described in accordance with Figs. 5, 6 and 7. In a case where the offset curves INF₁, INF₂ intersect, area cutting is performed through processing similar to that of steps 23 through 29 by obtaining the intersection points between the straight line SL In the foregoing, area cutting is performed by checking in advance whether offset curves, which are offset outwardly from two respective closed curves inside a curve of an external shape, intersect each other, obtaining a combined offset curve in case of intersection, and using the combined offset curve. However, area cutting can be carried out without obtaining a combined offset curve. Fig. 11 is a view for describing another area cutting method for a case where a portion incapable of being machined exists. A in the Figure is for a case where the i th cutting path PT In Fig. 11, the tool is moved along the first and second offset curves in the cutting feed mode. However, it is possible to adopt an arrangement in which the foregoing processing is executed while keeping the tool at rest and then move the tool in the rapid traverse mode between R Further, in the case described above, an area cutting command is inserted into the NC tape, cutting paths are successively created by using the area cutting data that follow the area cutting command, and area cutting is performed by moving the tool along the cutting paths. However, the invention is not limited to such case, for an arrangement can be adopted in which an NC tape containing cutting path data is created by the aforementioned method and area cutting is performed by using the NC tape containing this cutting path data. According to the present invention as described above, if two or more islands lie so close together inside the curve of an external shape that the offset curves, which are obtained by offsetting closed curves specifying the respective islands by an amount dependent upon the tool diameter, intersect one another and therefore give rise to a portion incapable of being area machined, an area which omits this portion can be machined. Further, according to the present invention, it may be arranged to combine two offset curves to obtain a combined offset curve constituted by a single closed curve, and to carry out area cutting without allowing the tool center to penetrate the interior of the combined offset curve. In other words, it is arranged so that if a portion incapable of being area cut exists, this portion is not cut but the remaining portion that is capable of being area cut is so cut. Therefore, a machine tool no longer ceases operating when area cutting becomes impossible, and erroneous cutting no longer takes place, as with the prior art method. Moreover, the offset paths may be displayed on the display unit together with the islands and the curve of an external shape of an area. This allows the operator to readily perceive whether the offset curves intersect one another by observing the display and, hence, to readily ascertain whether a portion incapable of being area cut exists.
