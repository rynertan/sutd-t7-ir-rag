# Binary transversal filter.

## Abstract
Binary transversal filter having a plurality of stages of shift registers 2, 12 that are driven by timing signals MLT 3 of a frequency which is greater by a number of times that of clock pulses CLK being introduced, and weighing circuits 4, 14 which weigh outputs of the stages of each of the shift registers 2, 12 so that outputs of the weighing circuits 4, 14 can be synthesized 5 . The cha racteristic feature resides in the facts that NRZ signals 1 are introduced into the shift registers 2, 12 and that the shift registers are driven by timing signals MLT 3 of a frequency which is greater by M times that of clock pulses CLK of the NRZ signals.
