## Description
POLYMERIC COMPOSITION RESISTANT TO PHOTODEGRADATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention is directed to compositions and a method. More specifically, this invention concerns itself with ultraviolet light sensitive polymer compositions have enhanced resistance to photodegradation, and methods for enhancing the resistance of ultraviolet light sensitive polymers to photodegradation. Description of the Prior Art Polymers have in the past and continue to provide an attractive substitute for other more traditional types Qf structural materials e.g., wood and metals because of relatively inexpensive materials and fabrication costs. As polymers continue to find new applications in, for example, the fabrication of automotive parts and building materials, they must also become more durable and capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces. Degradation of polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat, and or air. Such degradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structural integrity, changes in light transmission properties, changes in color, loss or reduction in flexibility and or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomenon.Those attempting to avoid polymer degradation have generally selected from among three possible approaches a elimination or reduction of the degradative forces b isolation of the sensitive polymer material from the degradative forces or c modification of the polymer composition to enhance its resistance. to degradative forces. The latter approach is generally preferable since it does not require engineering or structural changes in the polymer product environment. There are a variety of additives which have been disclosed as suitable for enhancing the resistance of polymers to one or more of the degradative forces discussed hereinabove. These additives hereinafter referred to as stabilizers can be physically combined with or engrafted upon the environmentally sensitive polymer, thereby prolonging its useful life in the hostile degradative environment.Stabilizers are available which can enhance the polymers resistance to more than one of the degradative forces and conversely, a stabilizer which is effective for prevention of, for example, oxidative degradation may have little if any effect upon the polymers resistance to other degradative agents. Thus, it is not uncommon for polymers to contain a variety of stabilizer materials, each being present for the prevention of the particular degradative reaction. One of the more difficult to control of the degradative forces is irradiation of the polymer by ultraviolet light. The impact of such irradiation will of course vary depending upon the intensity and duration of exposure and thus may manifest itself only after a prolonged interval.The irradiation of polymers with ultraviolet light can often times cause cross linking of these materials thereby reducing its resiliency and or impact resistance. Changes in color and opacity are also often affected by prolonged exposure of the polymer to ultraviolet light. While many materials are know, and commercially available, as stabilizers against ultraviolet light degradation, the degree of protection afforded by such agents is often concentration dependent.The following list of references are illustrative of the types of ultraviolet absorbers commonly used in conjunction with polymeric materials sensitive to photodegradation U.S. Patent Nos. 3,362,929 3,362,930 3,829,292 3,901,849 3,910,918 3,939,164 published patent application numbersB402,162 and B571,638 UK patent 999,806 and an article appearing in J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 60 1458 et seq. 1938 .In addition, commonly assigned U.S. patent applicationsSerial No. 697,345 and 697,387 both filed on June 18, 1976 disclose compounds which are highly effective as ultraviolet light stabilizers for polymeric materials. The compounds disclosed in the above referenced pending patent applications are substituted decahydroquinolines. Such compounds are highly effective in enhancing the resistance of polyolefins to photodegradation by ultraviolet light. As will be readily appreciated, the addition of substantial amounts in excess of 10 weight percent of stabilizer materials to a polymer can often modify its intrinsic physical, chemical and or electrical properties or the intrinsic properties of articles prepared therefrom.Thus, there is a continuing need for highly efficient ultraviolet light stabilizer compounds and compositions which are protective of polymers at low concentrations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to remedy the above as well as related deficiencies in the prior art. More specifically, it is the principal object of this invention to provide a polymer composition having enhanced resistance to photodegradation from light within the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Another object of this invention is to provide a polymer composition having enhanced resistance to ultraviolet light degradation, yet containing low concentrations of stabilizer compounds. Still yet an additional object of this invention is to provide a method for enhancement of the resistance of ultraviolet light sensitive polymers to photodegradation thereby prolonging their useful life in a degradative environment. The above and related objects are achieved by providing a composition containing an ultraviolet light sensitive polymer and, in amounts sufficient to enhance the resistance of said polymer to photodegradation, a stabilizer mixture containing at least one substituted decahydroquinoline compound and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzotriazoles,benzoates and nickel phenolate complexes. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The compositions of this invention can be readily prepared by simply combining a polymer which is sensitive to ultraviolet light degradation and the stabilizer mixture under conditions designed for uniform distribution of said mixture throughout the polymer. Ordinarily, the concentration of stabilizer mixture in the polymer will range from about 0.05 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer to about 5 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer.The preferred content of stabilizer mixture in the polymer compositions of this invention is typically in the range of from about 0.1 parts by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts ultraviolet light sensitive polymer to about 1 part by weight stabilizer mixture per one hundred parts by weight ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. Virtually all polymeric materials are sensitive, at least to some degree, to photodegradation by ultraviolet light. The term photodegradation is used throughout this disclosure in reference to ultraviolet ight sensitive polymers to describe any photo induced changes in the physical, chemical, and or electrical properties caused by such irradiation. Such degradative changes can include cross linking of the polymer, dehydrohalogenation, reduction in chain length, photo oxidation, etc.Polymers which are especially sensitive to ultraviolet light degradation are materials which contain unsaturation along their respective backbone, vinyl halide polymers, polyolefins, polyacetalde hydes, polyurethanes, ABS resins, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, poly a substituted acrylates, varnish, phenol formaldehyde resins, polyepoxides, polyesters, and their respective blends and copolymers. The preferred ultraviolet light sensitive polymers of the composition of this invention are poly a mono olefins. Such amono oleo in monomers used in preparation of the latter polymers include ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, 4 methyl l pentene, and the like.

One such representative preparation is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,146,217, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The nickel phenolate complexes which are suitable for use in the stabilizer mixture of this invention can be represented by the following structural formulaEMI11.2 wherein R is lower alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms. Compounds falling within the scope of the above formula are commercially available e.g., Cyasorb W 1084 r 2,2 thio bis 4 t octyl phenolate n butylamine nickel available from American Cyanamide Company or can be prepared by techniques described in the open literature. One such representative preparation is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,975,358, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The compositions of this invention can contain, in addition to the materials described hereinabove, a variety of optional ingredients. Such ingredients can include metal oxides, such as zinc, calcium and magnesium oxide, fatty acids such as stearic, lauric acid and the metal salts thereof fillers such as calcium and magnesium carbonate, calcium and barium sulfonates, aluminum silicates, asbestos, and the like plasticizers and extenders, such as dialkyl and diaryl organic acids, such as diisobutyl, diisooctyl, diisodecyl and dibenzyl oleates, stearates, sebacates, azelates, phthalates, and the like ASTM Type 2 petroleum oils, paraffinic oils, castor oil, tall oil, glycerine, and the like antioxidants, such as 2,6 di t butyl paracresol, 2,2 methylene bis 4 ethyl 6 t butyl phenol , 2,2 thio bis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol , 2,2 Lmethylene bis 6 t butyl 4 ethyl phenol, 4, 4 butylidene bis a t butyl m cresol , 2 4 hydroxy 3, 5 di t butylanilino 4 , 6 bis octylthio 1,3,5 triazine, hexahydro 1,3,5 tris ss 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionyl s triazine, tris 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl isocyanurate, tetrakismethylene 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, distearylthiodipropionate, dilaurylthiodipropionate, tri nonylphenyl phosphite, tinthioglycolate, and the like and other ingredients such as pigments, tackifiers, flame retardants, fungicides, and the like. Optional compounding ingredients which are especially preferred for use in combination with above stabilizer mixtures are the antioxidants. The inclusion within the polymer composition of an antioxidant, in addition to the W stabilizer mixture, confers upon the polymer composition stability against two of the more environmentally hostile degradative forces. The antioxidant can be present within the polymer composition within the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight polymer, and preferably from about 0.2 to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer.Generally, the phenolic antioxidants are preferred for use in conjunction with the UV stabilizer mixtures of this invention. The combination of the W stabilizer mixture and a phenolic antioxidant is especially suitable for stabilization of polyolefin polymers especially stabilization against degradation by heat, oxygen and ultraviolet light. Ordinarily, the polymer is compounded with the various types of stabilizer materials in accord with standard mixing techniques and equipment such as in a Banbury mixer, a Henschel mixer, a rubber mill, an extruder mixer or equivalent device. The various components of the composition may be physically intimately blended either in the absence of or in the presence of a common solvent or in a solvent which is capable of dissolving the polymer component of the composition yet substantially incapable of dissolving the stabilizer ingredients. Typical of such solvent dispersing agents include hexane or benzene. Subsequent to intimately dispersing the various components of the composition within one another, the dispersing agent if any can be removed by selective evaporation and the resultant resin recovered.The resin may thereafter be formed into useable products by a variety of standard techniques. The ultraviolet light stability of the compositions of this invention is evaluated by exposing a sample of the composition to a Xenon or carbon arc light in a WeatherOmeter operating at temperatures of about 600C. Degradation of the sample is monitored periodically by measuring the carbonyl adsorption band at 1720 cm 1 using an IR spectrophotometer. The relatively rapid formation of carbonyl sites indicates photodegradation of the sample. This test procedure is an accepted method for evaluation of the accuracy of such W stabilizers and is fully described in the literature, see Photodegradation, Photooxidation andPhotostabilization of Polymers by Ranby and Raybeck, JohnWiley and Sons, New York City 1975 at page 125 e seq., and is also disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,909,493.Photo degradation of the sample can also be manifest by visual cracking of the sample when heated to about 1800C. Oxidative degradation and thermal stability of the sample can also be verified by monitoring the time required to effect discoloration and or embrittlement of the sample in an aging oven maintained at 1400C. EXAMPLES The Examples which follow further define, describe and illustrate the preparation and evaluation of the composition of this invention. Apparatus and procedures used in the preparation and evaluation of such samples are standard or as hereinbefore described. Parts and percentages appearing in such examples are by weight unless otherwise stipulated. EXAMPLE I A series of films were prepared 20 mils thick from polypropylene Profax 6501, available from HerculesInc., Wilmington, Delaware and 1 Tinuvin 328 2 3 ,5 di t amyl 2 hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole , a known W stabilizer available from Ciba Geigy 2 a substituted decahydroquinoline 3 a mixture of Tinuvin 328 and substituted decahydroquinoline and 4 devoid of any stabilizing agent. These films were prepared by dissolving approximately 200 grams of polypropylene in 300 mls. of benzene together with the desired stabilizing agent s . The solvent was thereafter evaporated leaving the resinous material. The resinous material was further processed by extrusion using a Brabender extruder operated at 4500F. and at 75 rpm. Films were prepared from the extruded material by placing a measured amount of the composition between parallel aluminum plates which were maintained at 4200F.The plates were then brought together thereby compressing the sample. The duration of the molding cycle is approximately 3 minutes and the amount of pressure applied approximately 20,000 psig. Heating is continued for only 1 3 of the compression cycle. A 4 minute cool down period is allowed prior to separation of the aluminum plates. The molded sheet thus obtained is in the range of 10 to 20 mils thick. This sheet is stripped from the aluminum plate and cut into strips approximately 1 x 2 and mounted for subsequent testing in an Atlas Model 60 W Weather Ometer. TheWeather Ometer is operated at 140 1500F. The sample, upon being placed within this device, was subjected to a Xenon light source and the ultraviolet light degradation thereof plotted by monitoring the infrared absorption band of the sample at 1720 cm 1 this band corresponding to carbonyl group formation .A Perkin Elmer Model 467 IR spectrophotometer was used to monitor carbonyl group formation.In addition to the listed materials of the composition specified hereinabove, all samples contained the antioxidant,Irganox 1010 1 tetrakis methylene 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamate imethane, available from Ciba Geigy or GOODRITEs 3125 a triester of a substituted cinnamic acid and 1,3,5 trls12 hydroxyethyl s triazine 2,4,6 trione, available from BFGoodrich .

As is evident from the above comparative data, the presence of both Tinuvin and the substituted decahydroquinoline in the film sample enhance the resistance of polypropylene to degradation by approximately 60 in excess of the decahydroquinoline stabilized film and approximately 250 above the Tinuvin stabilized film. These results clearly demonstrate that Tinuvin and the substituted decahydroquinolines behave synergistically when used in combination with one another as a stabilization mixture for polypropylene.
