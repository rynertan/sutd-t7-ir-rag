# Method of making a master replicating tool.

## Abstract
A method of making a master replicating tool having a predetermined aspherical profile from which negative aspherical profiled optical elements can be made, compris ing machining a blank of a hard, non deformable silieceous material with a cutting tool in a one stage machining opera tion to produce substantially the predetermined profile, coat ing the surface so produced with a layer of nickel or nickel based alloy, machining the nickel or nickel based alloy to produce the predetermined profile with the cutting tool and protecting the surface by applying a layer of an inert, scratch resistant material thereon. Hand figuring the blank after machining is avoided. The scratch resistant layer is thin and can be between 500 Å and 5000 Å thick. This layer is applied by vapour deposition and is preferably vacuum deposited vitreous carbon. The blank is machined to produce the substantial predetermined profile to within the limits determined by the fracture planes of the siliceous material which are produced during the machining operation and these fracture planes may be less than 20 µm for ceramic materials.
