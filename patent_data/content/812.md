# A process for isomerizing xylenes.

## Abstract
Isomerization of xylenes in admixture with ethyl benzene by contact with a zeolite catalyst such as ZSM 5 is improved by use of zeolite having a silica alumina ratio of at least 500 at a temperature above about 427 C. At these conditions, conversion of ethyl benzene follows a different reaction path which permits high conversion of ethyl benzene to benzene without loss of xylenes by disproportionation.
