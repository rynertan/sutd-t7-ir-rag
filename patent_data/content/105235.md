# ELECTRONIC AC INDUCTION MOTOR BRAKE

## Abstract
A braking control circuit for an alternating current motor is disclosed as having a winding and adapted to be coupled to an energizing control circuit for connecting a source of AC voltage to and for disconnecting the source of AC voltage from the winding. The braking control circuit comprises a selctively con trolled rectifier operative in a first conductive mode for applying rectified current to the winding to brake the motor and in a sec ond non conductive mode, and a switching circuit coupled to the rectifier and responsive to the disconnecting of the source of AC voltage from the winding for switching the rectifier between its first and second modes at a first switching rate to brake the motor rotation at a corresponding first braking rate, and thereafter for switching the rectifier between its first and second modes at a second switching rate different from the first switching rate to brake the motor at a corresponding second braking rate.
