# Cable termination apparatus.

## Abstract
A cable termination apparatus 90 for use in locating and terminating an electrical cable 10 of the twin axial type to an electrical connector 50 , the cable having a pair of insulated wires 20, 30 having inner conductors 22, 32 , the apparatus being characterized by as comprising a body 91 of conductive material including a passage 95 for receiving and locating one of the wires 30 and a radial slot 96 receiving and locating the inner conductor 22 of the other wire 20 , the passage 95 extending through the body and having a generally frusto conical wire entry portion, the slot 96 extending axially inward from one end of the body and intersecting with the frusto conical portion to provide stress relief to the conductor 22 terminated e.g., soldered 98 within the slot.
