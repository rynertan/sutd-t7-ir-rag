# Method and system for encapsulating electronic components into plastic material.

## Abstract
Method for encapsulating parts of elements 11 into a plastic material to manufacture electronic components. The mould has one or more parallel rows of mould cavities 6 , into which a plastic material is injected through one or more sprues 4 . The elements are part of a strip 1 of which the length is a multiplicity of the length of a row of cavities, which strip is step by step treated in said mould such that an uninterrupted strip of components is obtained.
