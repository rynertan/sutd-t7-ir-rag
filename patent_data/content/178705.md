## Description
The invention relates to a composition of triglycidyliso cyanurate hereinafter TGIC with reduced tackiness. TGIC is a much used raw material and auxiliary in many chemi cal reactions, particularly in the preparaton of polycondensation pro ducts resins . In such uses it is often desirable for the TGIC to be used in a manageable solid form. In its preparation, however, TGIC is usually first obtained in a liquid form, upon which it must be crystallized. Unfortunately, this presents considerable problems. It is very hard for TGIC to crystallize out of its melt, and very small amounts of impurities stemming from the preparation even make crystalli zation virtually illusory. If a more or less solid product is obtained at all, it is sticky and virtually unmanageable. It is therefore custo mary for TGIC to be subjected to extreme and very expensive purification processes, while such a high degree of purity would as such not be necessary for the intended uses, provided the product could be obtained in a manageable solid form. The object of the invention is to provide a solution for this problem. According to the invention a composition of TGIC with reduced tackiness consists of at least a solid mixture of TGIC and a non reactive polyester. The TGIC content of this mixture is preferably 50 wt at most in order to achieve an effective reduction of the tackiness. The lower limit of the TGIC content is determined by economic considerations. Below 5 wt the TGIC content is too low for practical reasons. The effective TGIC content of said mixture ranges from 10 70 wt , particularly from 25 50 wt . The expression non reactive polyester is in this connection understood to mean that under the preparation and storage conditions of the TGIC composition the polyester does not appreciably react with the TGIC. Preference is given to using a polyester which essentially does not contain any free acid groups, because such groups often lead to reactivity of the polyester. According to a suitable mode of realization the polyester used is a so called non functional polyester, i.e. a polyester which does not essentially contain any free acid groups or alcohol groups, in addition to the ester groups. As end groups in the molecules such polyesters contain groups derived from monovalent alcohols and or monovalent acids. Examples of usable monovalent alcohols are aliphatic, aromatic and aliphatic aromoatic mono alcohols with 1 20 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance methanol, ethanol, iso propanol , butanol, 2 ethylhexanol and the natural fatty alcohols, such as palmityl alcohol, stearyl alco hol or oleyl alcohol, or also phenols, benzyl alcohol or phenylethyl alcohol. Examples of usable monovalent acids are aliphatic, aromatic and aliphatic aromatic monocarboxylic acids with 2 20 carbon atoms per mole cule, for instance acetic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid and the natural fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid, or also phenylacetic acid. Particularly suitable are monovalent aromatic carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid or its substituted derivatives, for instance o methylbenzoic acid, p methoxybenzoic acid. According to another mode of realization the polyester applied is a so called hydroxy functional polyester. These can be obtained from the normal polyester ingredients of polyvalent alcohol and polyvalent acid without addition of monovalent alcohol or acid, in which case an excess of polyvalent alcohol is used. The hydroxyl value of such a polyester may be, for instance, 5 100, more specifically 25 65, calcu lated as mg KOH g. The acid component contained in the polyester to be used is preferably substantially a dibasic aliphatic, aromatic or aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acid, for instance glutaric acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, 1,10 decanedicarboxylic acid or orthophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid. The dibasic acids can be used either alone or in combination with each other. The preferred dibasic aromatic acid is terephthalic acid and the preferred aliphatic acid is adipic acid. The alcohol component of the polyester to be applied pre ferably consists substantially of one or more aliphatic, aromatic or aliphatic aromatic diols. Examples of the aromatic diols are 2,2 di 4 beta hydroxyethoxyphenyl propane 2,2 di 4 beta hydroxyethoxyphenyl butane 2,2 di 4 hydroxypropoxyphenyl propane 2,2 di 3 methyl 4 beta hydroxyethoxyphenyl propane the polyoxyethy lene or polyoxypropylene ether of 4,41 isopropylidenediphenol, in which the two phenol groups are ethoxylated or propoxylated and the average number of oxyethylene or oxypropylene groups is 2 to 6 di 4 beta hydroxyethoxyphenyl ketone and di 4 beta hydroxypropoxyphenyl ketone. The preferred aromatic diols are hexanediol 1,6, butanediol 1,4, 2,2 di 4 beta hydroxyethoxyphenyl propane and 2,2 di 4 hydroxypropoxyphenyl propane. The eligible divalent aliphatic alcohols are hexanediol 1,6 butanodiol 1,4 2,2 dimethylpropanediol 1,3 propyleneglycol 1,2 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol and ethyleneglycol, which alcohols may contain groups other than hydroxyl groups, such as for instance diethyleneglycol. The divalent aliphatic alcohols can be used either alone or in combination with each other. Both the acid component and the alcohol component may contain up to 10 3,4 or polyvalent acids respectively alcohols, such as for instance trimesic acid, trimellitic acid respectively glycerol, tri methylolpropane pentaerythritol, or a poly functional hydroxy acid, such as for instance dimethylpropionic acid. The invention also relates to a process for making a composi tion of TGIC with reduced tackiness in which TGIC and a non reactive, preferably crystalline or crystallizable, polyester are mixed to form an at least partly liquid mixture and the resulting mixture is solidified. A major advantage of the process of the invention is that liquid raw TGIC can be started from without pre purification. The raw TGIC may, for instance, have been prepared by converting cyanuric acid with epichlorohydrin followed by dehydrohalogenation. The invention is elucidated by means of the following, non restrictive examples. To a reactor with a capacity of 3 litres, provided with a thermometer, a stirrer and a distiller, 1360 grammes hexanediol 1,6 and 1660 grammes terephthalic acid are supplied. Subsequently, during stirring, while a light nitrogen flow is passed over the reaction mix ture, the temperature is raised to 250 C. In this process water is formed. After 350 grammes water has been caught, the acid number is 10.7. Under reduced pressure the esterification is continued to acid number 2. This resin has the following values 300 grammes of the resin from example 1 is melted. At a tem perature of 160 C 300 grammes TGIC is added. After the mixture has been homogenized for 30 minutes, it is poured out and, after cooling, granu lated. The epoxy equivalent weight of this product is 232. 516 grammes polyester resin with an acid number of 34 Uralac P 2900 of DSM Resins is mixed in dry condition with 84 grammes of the product from example 2, 300 grammes titaniumdioxide KRONOS, Cl 310 , 9 grammes polyacrylate Resiflow PV 5, 66 active, rest silica, Worlée and with 4.5 grammes benzoin. This mixture is subsequently put in an extruder make Buss, type PR 46 . The extrudate is cooled, ground and screened, with the screen fraction smaller than 90 micrometres being caught and used as powder paint. This powder paint is applied by electrostatic spraying to steel panels previously degreased with trichloroethane. In this process an electrostatic spraying device make Gema, type HP 720, is used.
