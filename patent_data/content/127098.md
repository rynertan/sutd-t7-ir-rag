## Description
DERIVATIVES OF BETA S IINO GASSE TRItETHYII2QNIONIO BUTYRATE AND THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE This invention relates to derivatives of ss amino y trimethylammonio butyrate and their production and use. There has for sometime been a demand for a more effective antidiabetic drug having a new mode of action for the treatment of diabetes and its complications, the incidence of which has been on the steady increase. Thus, in diabetes, as an insulin deficiency promotes a liberation of fatty acids in the adipose tissue, there occurs an increased supply of fatty acids to the liver and as the decomposition of fatty acids is concurrently promoted, the production of ketone compounds is stimulated, leading to the so called ketonemia. In the extrahepatic tissues, the utilization of glucose is poor and the ketone compounds so produced are used as energy sources.Therefore, it is expected that if the decomposition of fatty acids is inhibited, the production of ketone compounds will be attenuated and, consequently, the utilization of glucose be promoted so that blood sugar levels are ultimately decreased. In other words, a specific inhibitor of fatty acid degradation would be of value as a new antidiabetic drug relying on a new mechanism of action. In view of these background facts, the present inventors made an extensive study for the development of a new antidiabetic and discovered that derivatives of the compound of the formula EMI2.1 are substances capable of inhibiting the decomposition of fatty acids, and have completed the present invention.The present invention is directed to 1 a compound of the formula EMI2.2 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon residue and R2 is a group represented by the formula OR3 in which R3 is a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon residue or by the formula NH R4 in which R4 is a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon residue , provided that when R1 is a hydrogen atom or an acetyl group, R2 is not a hydroxy group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof 2 a method of producing the compound I or a salt thereof, which comprises subjecting a compound of the formula EMI2.3 or a salt thereof to hydrocarbon residue introduction reaction, esterification reaction and or amidation reaction 3 an antidiabetic agent which contains an antidiabetically effective amount of the compound I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent therefor, 4 a compound in the optically active D form which is represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein R5 is a hydrogen atom or an acetyl group or a salt thereof and 5 a method of producing a compound of the formula EMI3.2 wherein R6 is COCH2CH3 or COCH2CH2CH3, which comprises cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genusEmericella and capable of producing the compound IV in a culture medium so as to cause formation and accumulation of the compound IV in the culture medium and isolating said compound.

The hydrocarbon residue introduction reaction according to the invention is effected by using a halide carrying the desired hydrocarbon residue or an alkyl sulfate such as dimethyl sulfate. The halogen in said halide is, for example, bromine, iodine or chlorine. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent such as tetrahycrosuran, dioxane, water, dimethyl formamide, chloroform, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate or pyridine, or in a mixture of such solvents.The alkylation reaction, for instance, is generally carried out in the presence of a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide or sodium hydride, at a temperature generally in the range of about 100 to 800C but not particularly limited thereto for about 5 to 48 hours, preferably about 5 to 12 hours. In cases where the above mentioned hydrocarbon residueR1 is an oxo substituted alkyl, the above hydrocarbon residue introduction reaction may be carried out in the conventional manner of acylation. As the aclatin agent to be used in said acylation reaction, there is used an acylating agent containing an oxo substituted alkyl group acyl group as represented by R1. Said acylating agent includes conventional acylating agents, such as halides, anhydrides, active esters and azides each derived from an acid containing said acyl group. The halogen of said halides is, for example, chlorine or bromine. Said active esters include, among others, p nitrophenyl esters and N hydroxysuccinimide esters. Said acylation reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent. Said solvent includes, among others, water, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, chloroform, dichioromethane, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide and pyridine. Such solvents may be used either alone or in the form of a mixture.The acylating agent is used generally in an amount of about 1 to 5 moles, preferably about 1 to 1.5 moles, per mole of the starging compound. Generally, the acylation is advantageously carried out in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal hydrogen carbonate, an alkali metal carbonate, an alkali metal hydroxide, a trialkylamine or pyridine. The reaction temperature is not critical. Generally, however, the reaction is carried out about 100 to 500C, preferably at about 5 to 300C, for about 1 to 48 hours, preferably about 1 to 12 hours. The pH in the reaction system is kept at about 7 to 11, preferably about 8 to 9. The esterification reaction in the practice of the invention can be carried out in the conventional manner.Thus, for instance, in accordance with one mode of carrying out said esterification reaction, the starting compound is suspended in an alcohol which contains an alkoxy group represented by R2 and, then, a gas such as hydrogen chloride gas is blown into the suspension. In this mode, the alcohol is used in large excess of the starting compound.The reaction temperature is generally about 0 to 800C, preferably about 25C to 600C, and the reaction time, namely aas introduction period, is about 1 to 12 hours, preferably about 1 to 4 hours. The esterification reaction may also be effected by suspending the starting compound in an alcohol which contains an alkoxy group represented by R2 with an inorganic or organic acid, such as hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid or toluene sulfonic acid, added thereto in advance, and treating the resulting mixture at about 0 to 1000C, preferably about 250 to 800C, or with heating under reflux, for about 5 to 48 hours, preferably 5 to 12 hours. In accordance with another mode of said esterification, an alcohol containing an alkoxy group represented byR2 is reacted with thionyl chloride, acetyl chloride, sulfinyl chloride, trifluoroacetic acid anhydride or the like at a low temperature of about 400 to 5 C, preferably about 200 to 50C, and then the starting compound is added to the above reaction mixture for treatment. The treatment reaction is carried out at about 0 to 1000C, preferably about 250 to 800C, or with heating under reflux, for about 1 to 48 hours, preferably about 4 to 12 hours. The amidation according to the invention is effected, for example, by bringing the above ester into contact with ammonia or an amine of the formula NH 2 R4 wherein R4 is as defined above. For said reaction, ammonia or the amine is used in an amount of about 1 to 20 moles, preferably about 2 to 10 moles, per mole of the ester. The reaction is carried out at about 0 to 1000C, preferably about 25 to 600C, for 12 to 72 hours, preferably 24 to 48 hours. The amidation may also be effected, for example, by activating the carboxyl group of the starting compound and then bringing the activation product into contact with ammonia or the above mentioned amine. Said activation is effected by treating the starting compound, for example, with phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or the like for conversion of said compound to the acid chloride form, or with isobutyloxycarbonyl chloride, ethoxycrbonl chloride or the like for conversion of said compound to the mixed acid anhydride form, or by converting said compound to an active ester with p nitrophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxy 5 norbornene 2, 3 dicarboximide or the like. The thus activated starting compound is reacted with about 1 to 2 moles, per mole of the activated starting compound, of ammonia or the amine.The reaction is carried out at about 0 to 1000C, preferably about 25 to 60 C, for about 12 to 24 hours. In accordance with a further mode, the amidation may be carried out by contacting the starting compound with ammonia or the amine in the presence of a condensing agent such as a carbodiimide e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide , carbonylimidazole or N ethyl 5 isoxazolium 3 sulfonic acid salt. The condensing agent is used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles, preferably 1.2 to 1.5 moles, per mole of the starting compound. The reaction is carried out at about 10 to 500C, preferably about 5 to 250C, for about 5 to 48 hours, preferably about 10 to 24 hours. The thus produced compound I is separated and or collected from the reaction mixture by the conventional method, such as extraction with an organic solvent e.g. chloroform, n butanol or column chromatography using an ion exchange resin or an adsorbent resin, among others. Those compounds I in which R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon residue and R2 a group of the formula OR3 wherein R3 is a hydrocarbon residue which may optionally be substituted or the formula NH R4 wherein is is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue which may optionally be substituted can be produced by i bjecting the compound II or a salt thereof to hydrocarbon residue introduction reaction and then subjecting the resulting compound to esterification or amidation or ii subjecting the compound II or a salt thereof to esterifi cation or amidation and then subjecting the resulting compound to hydrocarbon residue introduction reaction. The compound III in the optically active D form can be produced for example by the following procedure EMI10.1 In the above formulas, the group R8 means a protective group other than acetyl. The protective group R8 is exemplified by t butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl. Rg is a protective group which is eliminable under conditions different from those for eliminating the protective group R8.

The compound V is a protected D asparagine in which the a amine group is protected by a protective group represented by R8. The compound V can be produced by reacting D asparagine with a protective group introducing reagent containing R8 R8 X wherein R is, for instance, halogen, active ester or amide . The reaction is carried out in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or dioxane, in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide e.g. NaOH, KOH or triethylamine, at about OOC to 259C for about 1 to 24 hours. For the production of compound VI from compound V , the compound V is reacted with bistrifluoroacetoxyphenyliodine in 2 mixed solvent composed of water and dimethylformamide.

For the production of compound VII from compound VI , the compount VI is acylated at the amino group thereof with an agent for introducing a protective group represented by Rg . Thus, said protective group Rg introducing agent and the compound VI are reacted in water, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide or a mixed solvent composed of these, at about 0 to 500C for about 5 to 24 hours. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or sodium hydrogen carbonate.

The Wolff rearrangem.ent is carried out by reacting the diazonized compound with a silver salt of benzoic acid or acetic acid, for instance, dissolved in an organic base such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N methylmorpholine,N ethylmorpholine or pyridine, at about 5 C to 500C, preferably about 0 C to 270C, in bye dark, for about 30 minutes to 10 hours. The compound IX is produced by saponifying the compound VIII . Said saponification is carried out by contacting the compound VIII with a hydroxide of sodium, potassium or barium, for instance, in water, an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, or a mixed solvent composed of water and an organic solvent such as mentioned above, at about 100C to 500C, preferably about 00C to 270C, for about an hour to 5 hours. The compound X is produced from the compound IX by selective elimination of R8 and introduction of acetyl group. Said elimination can be performed by a method conventionally used in the peptide syntheses such as hydrolysis, catalytic reduction, or acid treatment. The hydrolysis can be effected by any method that is conducive to a cleavage of an amide bond. For example, methods employing an acid, a base or an ion exchange resin may be mentioned.

The acid to be used in said acid treatment is, for example, hydrogen bromide acetic acid, hydrochloric acidacetic acid, hydrochloric acid dioane, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesuifonic acid. The temperature of the acid treatment should advisably be selected depending upon the acid used witin the range of about 10 C and 50 C, preferably about OOC to 25 C, and the reaction time within the range of about 30 minutes to 24 hours. The acetylation is effected by reacting the starting compound with acetic anhydride, or a mixed acid anhydride prepared by reacting acetyl chloride or acetic acid with an alkoxycarbonyl chloride such as methyl chiorocarbonate, ethyl chlorocarbonate, butyl chlorocarbonate, propyl chlorocarbonate or isobutyl chlorocarbonate, in water or a mixed solvent composed of water and an organic solvent such as acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran.

The reaction temperature is about 100C to 500C, preferably about OOC to 250C. The trimethylation of compounds III from the compound X in accordance with the present invention is carried out, for example, by reacting compound X with dimethyl sulfate, methyl bromide, methyl chloride or methyl iodide in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide.

The desired products yielded by either of the above reactions can be isolated and purified by conventional separation and or purification techniques, such as chromatography, recrystallization, etc. The compound III is produced by hydrolysis of the compound III . The hydrolysis can be effected by any method that is conductive to a cleavage of an amide bond.For example, methods employing an acid, a base or an ion exchange resin may be mentioned. Examples of said acid include inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid and examples of said base include potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. Examples of said ion exchange resin include Dowex 50 Dow Chemical,U.S.A. , Amberlite IR 120 Rohm and Haas Co., U.S.A. andDiaison SKlA and SKlB Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd.,Japan . When the acid is employed, the reaction is preferably conducted in aqueous solution and when an aqueous solvent is employed, it is preferably a mixture of water with methanol, ethanol, butanol or the like.

Isolation of deacetyl FA 5859 or a salt thereof from the reaction product mixture can be accomplished by the per se conventional procedures such as ion exchange, adsorption, concentration, crystallization, etc. While the desired compound can be isolated optionally as the free compound or as a salt thereof, it is more expedient to isolate it in the form of a salt. A typical procedure for isolating the desired substance from the reaction mixture comprises adsorbing the substance on a strongly acidic ion exchange resin or the like, desorbing the same with hydrochloric acid or the like and collecting ninhydrin positive fractions. When the hydrolysis is effected with hydrochloric acid for instance, a more expedient procedure may be adopted. Thus, the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the excess hydrochloric acid and a solvent such as methanol, ethanol or diethyl ether is added to the residue to give hydrochloride of the substance as crystals. By the process described above is obtained the compound III as the free compound or as a salt. The optically active L form of compound II , which is the starting compound to be used in practicing the invention is deacetyl FA 5859. Deacetyl FA 5859 can be produced, for example, by cultivating a microorganism be longing to the genus Emericella and capable of producingFA 5859 in a culture medium so as to cause formation and accumulation of FA 5859 in the culture medium, collecting the same and subjecting the same to hydrolysis. The chemical synthesis of the D form of the starting compound II for the method according to the invention is as mentioned hereinabove as a method of producing compound III from compound V . As for the L form, it can be produced in the same manner by using the L form of compound V . As the microorganism to be used in producing FA 5859 and compound IV , there may be used, for instance, any microorganisms which belong to the genus Emericella and are capable of producing FA 5859 and or compound IV . As an example of such microorganism, there is mentioned Emericella quadrilineata, and more particularly,Emericella quadrilineata IFO 5859. The above mentioned IFO 5859 strain was deposited onSeptember 14, 1954 at the Institute For Fermentation, Osaka IFO , Japan, and is listed in the Institute For Fermentation,Osaka IFO List of Cultures, 1978, Sixth Edition published by the IFO. The microbiological characteristics of Emericella guadrilineata are as described in Transactions of TheMycological Society of Japan, Volume 20, No. 4, 481 1979 . As it is true of microorganisms in general, microorganisms of the genus Emericella are liable to undergo mutation whether spontaneously or under the influence of a mutagen. Thus, any and all mutants that are obtainable by irradiation with X rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet light, etc., monospore separation, treatment with certain reagents or cultivation in media containing such reagents, or other mutagenic treatments, as well as those spontaneous mutants that may be available, can be successfully employed in the production of FA 5859 and or the compound IV when they are still capable of elaborating them. The medium used for the production of FA 5859 may be liquid or solid, insofar as it contains nutrients available to the strain employed, although a liquid medium is suited for mass production. In the medium are incorporated suitable proportions of assimilable carbon sources, digestable nitrogen sources, inorganic substances and trace nutrients. The carbon sources may for example be glucose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, dextrin, starch, glycerin, mannitol, sorbitol and oils and fats e.g.soybean oil, olive oil, bran oil, sesame oil, lard oil, chicken oil, etc. , fatty acids e.g. lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, etc. . The nitrogen sources may for example be meat extract, yeast extract, dried yeast, soybean flour, corn steep liquor, peptone, cottonseed flour, spent molasses, urea, ammonium salts e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium acetate, etc. and so on. In addition, salts including those of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc., metal salts such as those of iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, nickel, etc., salts of phosphoric acid, boric acid, etc., and salts of organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, etc. are also used as necessary.It is, of course, possible to add amino acids e.g. glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, lysine, valine, methionine, proline, etc. , peptides e.g. dipeptides, tripeptides, etc. , vitamins e.g. B1, B2, nicotinic acid B12 C, etc. , nucleic acids e.g. purine and pyrimidine and their derivatives and others. Of course, for the purpose of controlling the pH of the medium, an organic or inorganic acid, an alkali, a buffer solution or the like may be added. For defoaming purposes, an oil, a surfactant or the like may also be added to the medium. The cultural methods that may be employed include stationary culture, shake culture or aerobic submerged or stirred culture, for instance. For mass production, submerged aerobic culture is of course preferable. While the conditions of cultivation, of course, depends on the species or strain of microorganism, the cultural method used and so on, fermentation is generally conducted at a temperature of about 15 to 370C with the initial pH being set at pH about 3 to 8. Particularly desirable conditions are about 23 to 320C in the intermediate stage of cultivation and pH about 4 to 6 at the start of cultivation.While the cultivation time is also dependent on the abovementioned conditions, it is desirable to continue cultivation until the titer of the physiologically active substance has reached a maximum. In the case of shake culture or submerged aerobic culture in a liquid medium, the duration of time to such maximum titer is generally about 1 to 8 days. The FA 5859 and the compound IV thus elaborated occurs mostly in the liquid phase of the fermentation broth.Therefore, it is a recommend procedure to separate the broth into a supernatant and a cellular mass by filtration or centrifugation and purify the supernatant to recover the desired substance. However, it is also possible to subject the fermentation broth as such directly to a known purification procedure. To harvest FA 5859 and or the compound IV from the broth, the procedures generally known for the isolation of microbial metabolites can be employed. ror example, microbial cells are removed by centrifugation and the active product is separated and purified from the supernatant fluid. Thus, such procedures as the one utilizing solubilities or a difference in solubility in various solvents, precipitation from a solution, the method utilizing differential rate of precipitation, a difference in adsorptive affinity for a given adsorbent, ion exchange chromatography on ion exchangers, concentration under reduced pressure, crystallization, recrystallization, drying, etc.can be utilized either singly or in a suitable combination or in repetition. The compound I , III and IV each can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by the established procedure. As examples of the acid used for this conversion to a salt, there may be mentioned hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, etc. When the compound I , III and IV each is obtained as a salt form, it can be converted to a free form by the established procedure, such as a method employing an ion exchange resin to absorb the acid or base which forms the salt. Then, the fatty acid degradation inhibiting activity of the compound I , III , IV was determined in accordance with the method described in P.75 Metabolism of Lipids which is Vol. 9 of SeikagakuJikken Koza Text of Biochemical Experiments compiled by Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, published 1975, using rat liver homogenates. Thus, an SD strain rat 6 weeks of age, male was fasted for one day and, then, bled to death. The liver was immediately excised and homogenized with 10 times w v of a 0.25 M sucrose solution containing a 5 mMTris HCl buffer pH 7.4 , 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin using a Teflon rod homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 820 xg for 10 minutes and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 8,000 xg for 10 minutes.The resultant pellets were suspended in the same sucrose solution as above to a concentration of 0.2 g wet liver weigh 0.5 ml solution and 0.5 ml of the suspension was used as the enzyme solution in the reaction. Then, 2.5 ml of a reactant mixture comprising 30 umole of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 , 300 vmole of KC1, 3 pmole of ATP, 3 pmole of MgC12, 120 vmole of sucrose, 0.6 Umole of 1 14C palmitic acid 0.2 pCi and bovine serum albumin withamolar ratio of 1 5, pH 7.4 , 3 mole of L carnitine, 0.6 umole of Co enzyme A, 7.5 vmole of NAD, 0.03 vmole of oxalacetic acid, 0.1 ml of water or an aqueous solution containing an inhibitor and 0.5 ml of the enzyme solution was incubated aerobically at 370C for 20 min. in a sealed tube hanging a filter paper immersed with Hyamine Hydroxide 10 X Packard, Holland and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of 70 perchloric acid. 4C02 formed was trapped and the radioactivity was counted. The inhibitory activity measured is shown in Table 1.The inhibitory activity is shown as percentage of inhibitory activity to degradation activity of fatty acid facilitated by the addition of carnitine to that of not added of the compound.

Blood samples were taken 4 hours later from a vein of tail and ketone bodies were measured as ss hydroxybutyrate according to the modified method of Williamson L D.H.Williamson et al. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, P454 1968 , AcademicPress, New Yorkl. The amount of ketone bodies was shown as a relative amount of ss hydroxybutyrate percentage to the amount of p hydroxybutyrate in blood of control rats. Results obtained are shown in Table 2. As seen from the data, good relationship between inhibitoy activity of fatty acid degradation and antiketogenic activiy of the derivatives of B amino y trimetylaminobutyrate was o served. Table 2.

This abnormal increase of ketone bodies gives severe damages to patients, such as coma. Consequently, the present compounds, which have antiketogenic activity, are of value as new drugs for the treatment of ketonemia or ketoacidosis. In particular, it is presumed that the compound I wherein R1 is alkyl hardly causes side effect of inducing fatty liver, and that inactivation of the compound by enzymes is decreased. Therefore, the compound I whereinR1 is alkyl is advantageously used as a drug. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the present compound shows a remarkable fatty acid decomposition inhibitory activity and antiketogenic activity. Toxicity of the present compound is low, because there is not found dead mouse by 400 mg kg oral administration. Therefore, the compounds I , III , IV or salts thereof is useful as a fatty acid decomposition inhibitor, for instance. When the compound I , III , IV or a salt thereof is used as such a fatty acid decomposition inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes in mammalian animals e.g. mouse, rat, man , it is administered at a daily dose of about 0.2 to 200 mg kg. The compound I , III , IV or a salt thereof can be administered orally as such or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent in such dosage forms as tablets, granules, capsules, liquids, etc., or non orally in the form of an injectable preparation. In the production of oral preparations, there may be employed suitable amounts of binders e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cel lulose, macrogol, etc. , disintegrators e.g. starch, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, etc. , excipients e.g. lactose, starch, etc. , lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, etc. and so on. In the production of parenteral or non oral preparations, e.g. injections, there may be employed iso tonicating agents e.g. glucose, D sorbitol, D mannitol, sodium chloride, etc. , preservatives e.g. benzyl alcohol, chlcrcDut2nol, methyl p hydroxybenzoate, propyl pphydroxybenzoate, etc. , buffers e.g. phosphate buffer, sodium acetate buffer, etc. and so on.

This fermentation was conducted at 280C, 100 Q min. aeration, 200 r.p.m. agitation and an internal pressure of 1.0 kg cm2 for 114 hours. A couple of batches of fermentation thus obtained were pooled and the cells were removed by filtration to give a filtrate containing FA 5859. Reference Example 2 A 125 Q portion of the filtrate obtained in Example 1 was passed through a column of Amberlite IR 120 H form 20 Q and after the column was rinsed with 40 Q of water, elution was carried out with 1N aqueous ammonia.The eluate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 30 Q to remove the ammonia and the concentrate was passed through a column of chromatographic grade activated carbon 30 Q . The column was rinsed with 60 g of water and elution was carried out with 90 g of 50 aqueous methanol. The eluate was collected in 10 ut fractions and the active fractions No. 5 to No. 6 were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 25.5 g of a crude syrup. This crude product was dissolved in 100 ml of acetate buffer pH 4.0 0.05 M and the solution was passed through a column of Dowex 50 x 2 500 ml buffered with acetate buffer 0.1 H pH 4.0 .Then, elution was performed with the same buffer as above in the order of 1 L at pH 4.0, 1.5 L at pH 4.3, 1.5 t at pH 4.6 and 1.5 Q at pH 5.0.

After the column was rinsed with 600 ml of water, solution was carried out with 1.5 t of 0.5N aqueous ammonia. The eluate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 500 ml and the concentrate was passed through a column of Dowex 1x2 OB form 200 ml , followed by washing with 200 ml of water.

The molecular formula of FA 5859 and the NMR signal at 6 3.19 ppm 9H, s suggest the presence of a trimethylammonium group in the molecule. Moreover, the NMR spectrum indicates the presence of methyl protons of the acetyl group CH3CO at a 1.98 ppm 3H, s and a couple of methylene protons CH2 x2 at 6 2.42 ppm 2H, d and 3.56 ppm 2H, d and a methine proton CH at d 4.7 ppm. Decoupling studies reveal that the above couple of methylene protons are respectively coupled with the methine proton at 6 4.7 ppm, suggesting the existence of a partial structure of CH2 CH CH2 . Moroever, the molecular formula of this compound suggests the presence of a carboxyl group.This is also apparent from the fact that a C O vibration is seen at 1590 cm 1 in the case of the free compound and at 1730 cm 1 in the case of the hydrochloride. Therefore, the following planar structural formula may be advanced for FA 5859.EMI29.1 FA 5859 is in the optically active L form, because of its specific rotation. The salts is also L form.
