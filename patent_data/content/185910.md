# Thermal printer control device.

## Abstract
In a thermal printer control device gate circuits HD1 to HD8 are provided between the thermal head 3 and the print controller. After the print controller has supplied a print start signal to the thermal head, print signal control circuit 4 detects whether a print stop signal has not been supplied within a predetermined time, and closes the gate circuits to prevent supply of the print signals to the thermal head.
