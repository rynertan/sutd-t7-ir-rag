# Door mounting and actuating apparatus for a pressure vessel.

## Abstract
A pressure vessel such as a steam cooker 10 is provided with a door closure comprising a horizontally disposed door mounting and actuating member 20 pivotally mounted for swinging movement across an access opening 12 of the vessel and supporting a warped door 18 for movement into and out of the opening. A rotationally and axially movable shaft 60 carried in the door mounting member 20 has a cam 96 and follower 92 associated therewith for moving the shaft axially in response to rotation thereof. The door 18 is coupled to the shaft 60 by a mechanism which shifts the door laterally with respect to the door mounting member and also causes translational movement of the door toward and away from the mounting member in response to rotation of the shaft so that the door can be inserted through the opening in a warped condition and then be unwarped to seal against the inside of the opening without requiring an operator to exert a lateral force on the door closure.
