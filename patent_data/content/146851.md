# System and method for automatically controlling vehicle speed.

## Abstract
A system and method for detecting a distance from a vehicle to an obstacle in front of the vehicle and controlling the vehicle according to changes in the distance thereof holds the vehicle speed constant upon recognition of the fact that the detected obstacle is a plurality of regularly spaced, stationary objects disposed along a side of a curved road and otherwise the vehicle speed is controlled on the basis of the distance between the vehicle and detected obstacles such as other vehicles moving in front of the vehicle or obstacles resting on the road as the vehicle moves through a curve.
