## Description
TITLE CHLORINATED OR CH LOROSU LFONATE D ETHYLENE VINYL ACETATE COPOLYMER FOR USE IN PAINTS BACKGROUND OF ThE INVENTION This application is a continuation in part of application Serial No. 608,861 filed ,ay 10, 1984. The present invention is directed to a novel chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer for use in sprayable corrosion resistant paint compositions having a high solids content and a low viscosity, to a process for making the copolymers and to the paint compositions derived from these copolymers. Various polymers, such as chlorinated polyethylene rubber or chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, have been dissolved in solvents and mixed with conventional fillers and pigments to make sprayable corrosion resistant paints. The sprayable corrosion resistant paint compositions must have a viscosity low enough to be readily sprayable. It is also desirable to minimize the quantity of solvent for the polymer used in the paint composition. The paint compositions must contain sufficient solids to provide adequate covering characteristics and, perhaps, even more importantly, the paint when applied as a film to a substrate must be strong and capable of withstanding impact without cracking.Thus, the paint compositions must have adequate strength. Paint compositions containing high molecular weight polymers are known to provide better covering characteristics and have higher strength than paint compositions containing lower molecular weight polymers. However, such compositions are more difficult to spray on a substrate because their high molecular weights lead to higher solution viscosities. The paint compositions of the present invention contain a copolymer that results in sprayable paint compositions having a high solids content while, at the same time, they have a surprisingly low viscosity and, the paint compositions, when applied as a film to a substrate, exhibit excellent tensile strength which is an indication of the strength of the paint. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a copolymer for use in corrosion resistant paints which comprises a chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer made from an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin having a melt index of from about 350 10,000 and having a vinyl acetate content of from about 10 30 weight percent, said chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a glass transition temperature of from about 15 50 C, a combined chlorine content of from about 42 56 weight percent, about 2 6 acetate groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and, optionally, up to 5 sulfonyl chloride groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and sufficient chlorine atoms attached directly to the copolymer backbone carbon atoms to bring the total degree of substitution of the backbone carbon atoms of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer to about 30 50 . The chlorinated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are made by a process which comprises dissolving an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin having a vinyl acetate content of about 10 30 weight percent and a melt index of from about 350 10,000 in an organic solvent for the copolymer resin, adding a chlorinating agent and or a chlorosulfonating agent to the resulting solution to produce a chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer wherein the total degree of substitution of backbone carbon atoms of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer is about 30 50 and, optionally, contains up to about 5 sulonyl chloride groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of the copolymer. The chlorinated copolymer is especially useful for the preparation of sprayable paint compositions of high solids content and low viscosity. Such compositions comprise about 15 30 by weight, based on the weight of the total composition, of a chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer wherein said copolymer contains from about 42 56 weight percent combined chlorine, from about 2 6 acetate groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of said chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and up to 5 sulfonyl chloride groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of said chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer so that the total degree of substitution of the backbone carbon atoms of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer is from about 30 50 percent, an organic solvent for the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene viny acetate copolymer, and from about 20 35 by weight fillers ana pigments, based on the weight of the total composition, said sprayable paint composition having a solution viscosity of about 300 5,000 cps measured on aBrookfield viscometer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The ethylenefvinyl acetate copolymer resin that is chlorinated or chlorosulfonated contains about 10 30 percent by weight, preferably about 16 26 percent by weight, copolymerized vinyl acetate and has a melt index of from 350 10,OG0, preferably about 400 3000. The melt index is determined by ASTM D1234 65T, revised 1965 Condition E .The melt index of the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin that is chlorinated or chlorosulfonated must be between 350 10,000, If the melt index of the copolymer resin is less than 350, the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated copolymer will have too high a viscosity and when such copolymer is compounued in a paint composition, the resulting viscosity of the paint composition is, likewise, too high. If the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin has a melt index greater than 10,000, the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated copolymer elastomer is unduly soft and processing is difficult. The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin is dissolved in an organic solvent, such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example, chloroform, methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene, cblorobenzene or, preferably, carbon tetrachloride.The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin is reactea with the chlorinating agent, gaseous chlorine alone or with the chlorosulfonating agent, sulfuryl chloride to introduce on the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin, chlorine alone or with sulfur, wherein the sulfur is present on the chlorinated copolymer as sulfonyl chloride groups. The amount ot gaseous chlorine and sulfuryl chloride used in the process is determined by the required degree of chlorination or the amount of sulfur desired as sulfonyl chloride groups on the chlorinated copolymer. Generally between about 0.5 2 parts by weight gaseous chlorine and 0 0.1 parts by weight sulfuryl chloride per part ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin are used to incorporate the desired amounts of chlorine atoms and sulfonyl chloride groups on the copolymer. The temperature at which the chlorination or chlorosulfonation reaction is carried out may be varied over a wide range and is generally governed by the viscosity of the solution and the decomposition temperature of the conventional free radical catalyst used in the process. Usually the temperature is between about 80 1000C. Generally the chlorination or chlorosulfonation is conducted in the presence conventional free radical initiators such as 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropane nitrile . The resulting chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer can be isolated by known means, preferably, drum drying. Other well known methods of isolation that can be used are, for example, precipitation, filtration and spray drying or solvent exchange to a nonchlorinated solvent. The resulting chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer has a glass transition temperature of from about 15 50 C and a combined chlorine content of from about 42 56, preferably 44 50, weight percent. The copolymer contains from about 2 6, usually 2.5 5.5, acetate groups per 100 backbone carbon atons of the copolymer. Optionally, the copolymer contains up to 5, usually 0.1 1, sulfonyl chloride groups per 100 backbone carbon atoms of the copolymer. The copolymer contains sufficient chlorine atoms attached directly to the copolymer backbone carbon atoms to bring the total degree of substitution of backbone carbon atoms of the copolymer to about 30 50 . The degree of substitution of the substituents on the chlorinated or chlorosultonated copolymer is critical, because of their effect on the glass transition temperature Tg of the copolymer.If the glass temperature is below about 150C, which occurs when the total degree of substitution is below about 30 percent, paint compositions containing the copolymers and conventional fillers and pigments, when applied as a film to a substrate are too soft and tacky and lack adequate tensile strength to form a strong film on a substrate. On the other hand, if the total degree of substitution of the backbone carbon atoms on the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer is more than about 50 percent, the glass transition is above about 50 C Paint compositions containing such copolymers when applied as a film to a substrate are too brittle and crack upon impact. If the amount of acetate groups on the copolymer is less than about 2 per 100 backbone carbon atoms or more than about 6 per 100 backbone carbon atoms of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, paint compositions containing the copolymer when applied as a film to a substrate are not strong and lack adequate tensile strength, even at the required degree of overall substitution.It is surprising that a chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, made from an ethylene vinyl acetate resin that has such a low molecular weight, as indicated by the melt index of the resin of from 300 10,000, would result in a chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer that when used as a component in corrosion resistant paint compositions would result in a film that is especially strong, as indicated by its tensile strength, and because of the low molecular weight of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated copolymer it can be readily applied to a substrate by spraying. The above described chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer can be formulated into corrosion resistant paint compositions by any conventional means with pigments and fillers on, for example, a ball mill. The pigments used can be any of the conventional types used in paint compositions comprising, for example, iron oxides, lead oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, coal dust, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulfate, as well as color pigments, including cadmium yellow, cadmium red, chromium yellow, and metallic pigments such as aluminum flake. Conventional fillers used in corrosionresistant paints can be incorporated in the composition. Representative fillers include calcium carbonate, clay, talc, etc. The corrosion resistant paint composition of the present invention contains about 15 30 percent by weight, usually 12 26 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer ana a solvent for the chlorinated copolymer. The solvent evaporates after the paint composition is applied to a substrate leaving the solid material to form a film or coating. The solvent is chosen so as to provide good viscosity and sprayability characteristics. The solvent also assists in the substrate wetting, promotes copolymer component compatibility, package stabilitv and coalescence or film formation. Representative solvents that can be used include aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, halogenated aliphatic compounds such as carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene, chloroform and methylene chloride, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, normal butyl alcohol, monoethers of glycols such as the monoethers of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, as well as mixtures of the above. The solvent is present in the composition in amounts of about 30 60 percent by weight based on the total weight of the solvent and the chlorinatea or chiorosulfonated ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer component and the pigments and fillers present. The composition contains a relatively large amount of solids which provides good covering characteristics.The particular amount of solvent used is that amount which will result in a paint composition having a solution viscosity determined in 30 percent by weight xylene of about 300 5000 cps, usually, 400 1000 cps, measured on a Brookfield viscometer. Generally, the utiliation of the chlorinated or chlorosulfonated ethyleneZvinyl acetate copolymer allows the addition of about 20 35 percent by weight fillers ana pigments to give a total solids content of from 35 65 percent by weight. In addition, plasticizers, antioxidants, U.V. light absorbers, flow control agents and other formulating additives can be used in the sprayable paint composition if desired. These materials are optionally present in amounts up to 5 percent by weight based on the total solids in the corrosionresistant paint composition. The corrosion resistant paint composition of the present invention is designed for application by spraying, although other conventional methods of coating, including brushing, dipping, and flow coating, can be employed if desired. However, the paint composition is especially formulated for spraying. Conventional spray techniques and equipment are utilized in the application of the corrosion resistant paint composition. The paint composition can be applied over any substrate including wood, metal, glass, cloth, plastics, and the like, as well as over various primers. The paint compositions are particularly useful on substrates such as primed steel, aluminum, insulation material and the like. In general, coating thickness of the paint composition on the substrate will vary depending upon the particular application desired. In general, coatings from 0.1 2 mm have been found to be satisfactory in most applications. After application of the corrosion resistant paint compositions to a substrate, the compositions can be cured. The compositions are not usually subjected to a heat cure cycle but, if desired, improvements in the properties are obtained when the compositions are cured at temperatures of about 400 1200C, for 5 60 minutes and, in most cases, from 600 1200C for about 10 30 minutes. Higher or lower temperatures with correspondingly shorter or longer times can be utilized. The exact cure schedule best employed depends upon the nature of the substrate. The corrosion resistant paint composition has a high solids content and yet the viscosity of the composition is low enough that it can be applied to a substrate by conventional paint spraying techniques. The following examples illustrate preferred eiibodiments of the invention in which amounts are given in parts by weight, unless otherwise indicated.
