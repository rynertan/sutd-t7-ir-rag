# Method for producing prepreg rovings and method for producing fibre reinforced plastic articles.

## Abstract
A method for producing a prepreg roving, which com prises impregnating a composition comprising an unsatu rated polyester, an unsaturated monomer e.g. styrene and a polysocyanate compound e.g. 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate in a filamentary reinforcing material 1 e.g. a glass roving and then heating the impregnated reinforcing material to react the unsaturated polyester with the polyisocyanate compound, thereby bringing the resin to the B stage and a method for producing a fiber reinforced plastic article, which comprises disposing prepreg rovings A , said prepreg rovings being prepared by the above method bet ween at least two plies of sheet molding compound B obtained by impregnating a composition comprising an unsaturated polyester and an unsaturated monomer in glass fibers and forming the impregnated product into a sheet and consolidating the resulting assembly under heat and pres sure. Figure 1 is a flow chart showing the production of the prepreg roving mentioned above.
