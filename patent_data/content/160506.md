# SENSOR CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A sensor circuit including a current driven type sen sor CR for detecting changes in a predetermined state and control means 16 having an input applied discontinuously with the output signal of the sensor means, wherein circuit arrangement is made such that the sensor means is supplied with a driving current only when the control means requires the output signal of the sensor means as the input signal to the control means. The sensor circuit finds advantageous application in floppy disc drives.
