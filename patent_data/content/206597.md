# Improvements in or relating to infra red heaters.

## Abstract
An infra red heater 1 for a glass ceramic top cooker comprises a dish containing a base layer of thermal insulating material. A peripheral wall of thermal insulating material extends around the periphery of the base layer and at least one infra red lamp 3 extends across the base layer. A ballast device 5 is electrically connected in series with the infra red lamp, for example in the form of a coil of bare resistance wire, and serves to reduce inrush current to the lamp. A thermal cut out device 7 cuts off the supply of power to the infra red lamp and to the ballast device 5 if the temperature of the glass ceramic cooking surface becomes excessive. The coil of bare resistance wire preferably has an electrical resistance which is approximately half the electrical resistance of the infra red lamp at its operating temper ature. The use of a ballast device 5 enables the infra red lamp 3 to be used in conjunction with a cyclic energy regulator 9 .
