# Battery flow restrictor.

## Abstract
An improved battery structure for a multicelled primary cell circulating electrolyte battery which provides for uniform distribution and rate of flow of the electrolyte to all of the cells. Batteries of this type include an intake raceway to conduct electrolyte along the edges of the cell plates to introduce the electrolyte to all of the cells. The invention contemplates the use of a flow restrictor in the form of a physical separator between the intake raceway and the cells which is interrupted by passages to permit a controlled flow of electrolyte to the cells. The passages are sized and located responsive to system parameters to provide a uniform flow and a predetermined pressure drop at the restrictor which is preferably of the order of ten times the pressure drop of the electrolyte through the cells.
