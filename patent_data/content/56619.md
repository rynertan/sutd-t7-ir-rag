# YARN FEEDING FINGER CONTROL DEVICE FOR A CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE, IN PARTICULAR A SINGLE CYLINDER HOSE KNITTING MACHINE

## Abstract
For selectively controlling yarn feeding fingers 2 in a circular knitting machine the yarn feeding fingers 2 whereof are individually pivoted to a stationary structure 4 and movable between a rest position and an operative one, with the drive ends 2b of the feeding fingers 2 there are associated respective electromagnets 11 the movable arm atures 12 whereof act as by thrust application on the respective drive ends 2b of the yarn feeding fingers 2 . The selective energization of the various electromagnets 11 is accomplished through a memory device driven by a photo electric unit located astride a disk formed with peripheral notches and made rigid with the machine main drum. Each forward step movement of the drum results in the sending of one or more pulses from the photoelectric unit to the memory device, wherein the knitting program is stored such that for each pulse or number of pulses there correspond an energization or de energization control impulse to a given electromagnet 11 .
