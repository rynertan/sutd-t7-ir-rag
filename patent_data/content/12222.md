# Magnet ignition device.

## Abstract
A magnet ignition device is provided with an angular po sition detecting device 8 for producing a first angular signal with one polarity corresponding to an angular position of a given crankshaft to an engine and a second angular signal with the other polarity corresponding to an angular position of the crankshaft retarded by a given angle relative to the an gular position where the first angular signal is generated. An ignition timing operation circuit 15 is driven by the first an gular signal. A signal representing advance angle information of the result of the operation by the operation circuit and the second angular signal are both applied to a switching ele ment 7 . In the circuit arrangement, only the second angular signal is used as an ignition signal in low rotational frequen cies suffering from a great variation of the rotational frequen cy of the engine and, in high rotational frequencies higher than a given rotational frequency, only the advance angle sig nal is used as the ignition signal. With such an arrangement, an instability of the ignition timing due to a great variation of the rotational frequency in low rotational frequencies is pre vented thereby to secure an accurate and stable ignition tim ing.
