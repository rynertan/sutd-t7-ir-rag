# A fluid pump for location within a liquid reservoir.

## Abstract
A fluid pump for location within a reservoir 10 and which is operable with rise and fall of liquid within the reser voir. The pump comprises a tube 30 of a resiliently deform able material, an abutment surface 35 which is engaged by the tube and a float device 32 which is mounted to the tube 30 . Liquid entering the reservoir causes upward movement of the float device 32 and such movement of the float device causes increasing engagement between the tube 30 and the abutment surface 35 . The increasing engagement between the tube and the abutment surface causes the tube to deform resiliently and a localised reduction in the contained volume of the tube is thereby effected to cause expulsion of fluid from the tube. Conversely, as the liquid level falls in the reservoir, the float device moves downwardly to reduce the extent of engagement between the tube and the abutment surface, so that the tube tends to resume its initial contained volume.
