# A method of making steel strip with high strength and formability.

## Abstract
A method of making steel is provided wherein low carbon steel is heat treated directly in connection with the hot rolling to a so called dual phase steel the structure of which is characterized by fine grained, polygonal ferrite and therein dispersed grains of martensite. The mainly in austenitic state hot rolled steel after finished hot rolling is cooled down to a predetermined temperature within the interval 800 650 C and kept there during more than 1 minute, thereafter cooled to a temperature below 450 C with a cooling rate exceeding 10 C second. The method is used for making steel strip exhibiting high strength and formability.
