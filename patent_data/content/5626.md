# Cap assemblies for lamps.

## Abstract
A GLS incandescent filament lamp has a conventional bulb 12 enclosing filament mount 7 and a lamp cap with a metal shell 10. Current leads 8 and 9 pass through a first moulded insulating base part 13 and their free ends lie in grooves 18, 19. A second moulded insulating base part 14, which fits onto the first part, has metal contacts which engage the free ends of the leads and are connected thereto by conductive cement which also fastens the parts of the base together. In a screw cap embodiment one lead is connected to a metal contact in the centre of the second part and the other lead is connected to a tag on the cap which is clamped between the two base parts.
