# Detecting the temperature of moulds of a glassware forming machine of the individual section type.

## Abstract
An infrared detecting device 50 is mounted for turning movement about a vertical axis 52 which lies in a plane which is substantially equidistant from the centre lines of two adjacent sections 20, 30 of the machine. The device is turned through an arc 54 about the vertical axis between a first orientation, in which it receives radiation from a mould portion 12 of a first 20 of the sections which radiation is used to detect the temperature of the mould portion, and a second orientation, in which it receives radiation from a mould portion 12 of the other 30 section.
