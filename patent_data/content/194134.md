# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit including an inverter circuit 1 including first and second transistors T₇, T₈ of different conductivities, and a level shift circuit 2 , the first transistor T₇ being supplied with an input signal IN via the level shift circuit 2 , the second transistor T₈ being supplied with the input signal IN directly, and the level shift circuit 2 having an amount of level shift such that, when an input signal IN corresponding to an H logic level is received, the level of the input signal supplied via the level shift circuit V
