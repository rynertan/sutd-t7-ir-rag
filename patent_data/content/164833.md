# Plunger mechanism for use in a glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
The plunger mechanism is for use in moving a plunger into or out of a mould cavity and has a piston 12 movable in a cylinder 10 with a piston rod 18 projecting from the piston. A plunger can be mounted on the piston rod. A passage 20 passes through the piston and the piston rod and communicates with the chamber in the plunger or with mould cavity. A tube 22 which can be connected to a source of air under pressure or to a vacuum source passes through the cylinder and enters the passage. The gap between the passage and the tube is sealed by an inwardly contracting ring 24 with an overlapping joint 25 which makes sealing contact around the tube. A ring of resilient material 32 may encircle the inwardly contracting ring and the wall of a recess in which it is mounted.
