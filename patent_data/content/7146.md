# Connector system for elongate members.

## Abstract
Three elongate members such as rods or tubes forming mutually perpendicular uprights 2 , transoms 1 and ledgers 3 in a scaffolding structure and interconnected by engage ment of a bracket 6 carried at one end of a first horizontal member 1 in a socket provided in a second upright member 2 , a third horizontal member 3 being engaged between the said end and the second member and retained in position by a wedge element 15 . The wedge element is jammed in posi tion by tightening a clamping nut 18 . The resulting intercon nection is easy to effect and makes use of standard pipes such as scaffolding tubes.
