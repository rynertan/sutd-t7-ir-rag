## Description
PLANT TISSUE CULTURE VESSEL Typically, explants are surface disinfected and then handled under sterile coiditions. After disinfection, explants are rinsed several tines with sterile distilled water and cut into desired segments with sterile instrun eiis. The explant is then placed in a cults vessel in contact wih the media and the vessel is placed in a culture roon in which light quantity, photoperiod, and temperature are controlled. After approxinately six to eight weeks in the culture room the developed explant material is used for the initiation of the multiplication stage of In Vitro propagation. Here the developed explant is aseptically removed from its vessel and trinned and divided if necessary. The tissue is then placed in a culture vessel in a medium with the appropriate hormone composition and balance to induce multiplication and returned to the culture room.After about another six to eight weeks in the culture room on a multiplication medium the tissue is aseptically removed from its vessel, divided, transferred to fresh medium and returned to the culture room. This transfer is either to a growth medium which is formulated to induce development of shoots, with or without roots, that will withstand the transition to the greenhouse environment or to a multiplication medium once again for further propagation. The ability to repeatedly recycle tissue culture through the multiplication stage Stage II accounts for the rapid increase which are one of the mein advantages of In Vitro propagation. This procedure, however, is a very labor intensive activity, and it has been estimated that as much as 60 65 per cent of the cost of producing plants In Vitro can be attributed to wages, salaries and associated costs W.C.

William1 Establishment of Tissue Grown Plants in the Greenhouse Environment, Proc.Fla.State, Hort.Soc. 91 235 237, 1978 .Consequently, there have been many attempts to reduce labor related expenses. One such successful attenipt is described in co pendingEuropean Application Nb. our Ref. Plant Propagation in which there is claimed a process for at least semi automated, and eventually completely autanated, plant tissue culture propagation comr prising providing plant tissue culture containing a large number of densely pecked seristematic areas, autanatically separating and thinning said tissue into small clusbers of meristematic tiSsues, bulk transporting said separated tissue aseptically to a separating apparatus wherein said tissue is washed and propagules of substantiallY uniform size and substantially free of phytotoxic cell debris are obtained, aseptically transporting said propagules to a culture vessel and distributing said propagules on the surface of a culture medium. For use In said process and other uses as well the present invention provides a plant tissue culture vessel provided with a substantially flat fine screening element elevated above the inner bottom surface of the vessel, said vessel being sterilizable. substantially sealable and adapted for growing plant tissue cultures supported on the surface of said screening element in optimal contact with culture medium filling said vessel to the level of said screening element, said screening element being sized to permit the passage of said culture medium therethrough while retaining said tissue culture on the surface thereof. In one possible embodiment of the present invention said screening element is supported on projections provided on the inner side salls of said vessel, while in preferred embodiments of the invention, as described in greater detail hereinafter, said screening element is supported within said vessel on a palletlike grid element positioned on the inner bottom surface of said vessel, said pallet being provided with apertures facilitating free flow of liquid within the areas defined by said grid. Preferably said screening element has a mesh size of about 250 to 4,000 micronS and a screening element having a mesh size of about 500 to about 700 microns is especially preferred. In hydroponic and other similar seed sprouting systems such as described in U.S. Patents 2 062 755 4 057 930 4 135 331 and 4 355 484 there are described different arrangements of seed and or plant supporting screens, however these are provided in order to support the seed or plant over a water or liquid medium so that they wont drown therein and said patents do not teach or suggest the use of the presently claimed screening element in the non analogous art of plant tissue culture propagation since in plant tissue culture propagation, the plant tissue culture propagules are usually embedded in the culture medium and the problem of drowning in liquid simply does not exist. Thus despite the existence of the art of water culture growing of plants on supporting screens for over fifty years as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent 2 062 755 heretofor no advantage was recognized for the use of a screening element in plant tissue culture propagation. Furthermore, the screen support elements used in said hydroponic systems are several orders of magnitude larger than those used in the present invention and are not sized to permit the passage of culture medium therethrough while retaining tissue culture on the surface thereof as described and claimed herein. Said vessel is preferably made of autoclavable material such as polycarbonate plastic or other similar material as described, e.g., in U.S. Patents 4 224 765 and 4 358 908. As already indicated the invention is primarily useful in the production of tissue culture derived plantlets by automated procedures.After the plant tissue is cut and or divided in bulk, it must be mechanically transported to a culture vessel and planted in contact with a medium in that vessel in such a manner as to facilitate growth and development in the tissue, Now, this can simply be accomplished by suspending the plant tissue in a liquid and volumetncally dispensing this suspension to a culture vessel according to the present invention. When a mixture of plant tissue and medium is dispensed to the presently proposed vessel the medium passes through the screen while the plant tissue is held by the screen. When the mixture is added until the level of the medium reaches the,level of the screen, the plant material lies on an even layer on top of a medium base. This is the optimal configuration for the growth and development of the tissue into plantlets. Another advantage of the vessel of the present invention is to allow the bulk transfer of developing tissue culture to fresh liquid or solid medium, When an Agar based medium Is used, the plant tissue loosely adheres to the screen, consequently the bulk transfer can be effected simply by moving the screen to a new vessel containing a liquid or solid medium base. Alternatively, if the tissue culture is resting on a liquid medium, then fresh medium can be added to the culture vessel after the spent medium is removed by aspiration. A further advantage is to allow the bulk removal of developed plantlets for inexpensive packaging and shipping. Vet another advantage is to allow for inexpensive in vitro screening of whole plantlets for resistance to environnicntal stress.That is, plantlets grown on the screening element can be transferred in bulk to a medium which contains the agent to be selected against.Here simply, the liquid medium under the screening element can be changed and the agent to be selected against introduced with the new medium. The invention will now be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments with reference to the following illustrative figures so that it may be more fully understood. It is stressed, however, that the particulars shown and described are by way of exançle and for purposes of illustrative discussion only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readlly understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention.In this regard no attempt is made to show structural details of the vessel and its component parts in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the 1invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice. In the drawings Figure 1 is a cross section of a culture vessel constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a top view of a culture vessel constructed in accordance with the present invention showing a pallet and only a portion of a screening element positioned thereon and Figure 3 ts a side view of the cover of the vessel. Referring now to the drawings in detail, there is seen an autoclavable polycarbonate vessel 1 fitted with a fine 600 micron mesh autoclavable nylon screen 2 one cm above the inner bottom surface 3 of the vessel. The screen forms a flat surface in the vessel covering its entire inside dimension so that very little plant material can flow around the screen. The screen rests on an autoclavable polycarbonate pallet like grid element 4 designed to allow the screen to remain flat while the med1um plant tissue mixture is dispensed . The pallet 4 is also designed to establish an even distribution of medium throughout the vessel by permitting the medium to flow through apertures 5 in the lower portion of the walls of the pallet 4. After filling, the vessel is closed with an autoclavable polycarbonate cover 6 as shown in Figures 3 and 4 and sized to tightly close said vessel 1. In operative use, medium plant tissue mixture is evenly dispensed on the surface of the screen 2. When the medium reaches the level of the screen dispensing Is terminated. The vessel is thus filled in such a manner that an even layer of plant tissue rests on and in good contact with a medium base and the vessel is then sealed with its cover 6.
