# Method for purification of anterior pituitary hormones.

## Abstract
Solutions containing an anterior pituitary hormone such as growth hormone or prolactin are treated to produce relatively pure hormone by a process comprising removal of impurities using an ion exchange column followed by fractionation of the eluent on an isoelectric focusing column. Fractions at the isoelectric point of the specific anterior pituitary hormone can be pooled, dialyzed with sterile water, and then lyophilized. The identity of the resulting product can be confirmed by electrophoretic analysis on sodium dodecylsulfate gel, immunodiffusion on an Ouchterlony plate, or both.
