# Fluid handling apparatus having a fluid metering volume therein.

## Abstract
A fluid handling device of the rotary slot type is character ized by a fluid metering volume disposed in the stator of the device in close proximity to a fluid transfer passage formed in the stator. The metering volume receives a piston movable in a suction and a pumping stroke to draw fluid into the metering volume and to pump fluid therefrom. A rotary seal having the slot formed therein is received by seal rotating means such that a portion of a tab formed on the seal is accessible to per mit removal of the seal from the rotating means.
