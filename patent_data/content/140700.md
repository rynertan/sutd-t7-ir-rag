# SELF ALIGNING HINGE

## Abstract
A hinge pin 26 passes through a central lug 24 form ing one hinge part. The other hinge part comprises two lugs 20, 22 flanking the central lug and having slots 54, 58 in which the hinge pin is loosely received. A U shaped spring 28 has ends hooked round the ends of the hinge pin and a central part hooked over a central post 74 integral with the flanking lugs 20, 22 . The spring urges the hinge pin into the slots 54, 58 but allows play in the hinge so that two halves 14, 16 of a housing, for example, can mate correctly with out resort to precision engineering in these parts of the hinge.
