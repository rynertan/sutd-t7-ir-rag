# Process of printing by impact and for marking areas where impact or pressure is applied.

## Abstract
A printing or reproducing or pressure detecting process comprising producing on a substrate a surface consisting essentially of a colored acetylenic composition of partially polymerized monomer which has at least two triple bonds which are conjugated, and having certain substituents in the molecule preferably 5,7 dodecadiyn 1,12 bis p bromo phenyl urethane monomer. When subjected to impact or pressure, these surfaces change color sharply e.g. an orange surface comprising the above bromophenyl urethane monomer, partially polymerized, changes sharply and in stantly to blue in those precise areas where struck by a typewriter letter face.
