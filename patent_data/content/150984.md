## Description
The invention relates to novel 6 substituted methylenepenicillanic acids, and novel 6 substituted hydroxymethylpenicillanic acids, certain esters and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods for their preparation and their use as beta lactamase inhibitors and intermediates therefor. One of the most well known and widely used of the classes of antibacterial agents is the class known as the beta lactam antibiotics. These compounds are characterized in that they have a nucleus consisting of a 2 azetidinone beta lactam ring fused to either a thiazolidine or a dihydro 1,3 thiazine ring. When the nucleus contains a thiazolidine ring, the compounds are usually referred to generically as penicillins, whereas when the nucleus contains a dihydrothiazine ring, the compounds are referred to as cephalosporins. Typical examples of penicillins which are commonly used in clinical practice are benzylpenicillin penicillin G , phenoxymethylpenicillin penicillin V , ampicillin and carbenicillin typical examples of common cephalosporins are cephalothin, cephalexin and cefazolin. However, despite the wide use and wide acceptance of the beta lactam antibiotics as valuable chemotherapeutic agents, they suffer from the major drawback that certain members are not active against certain microorganism. It is thought that in many instances this resistance of a particular microorganism to a given beta lactam antibiotic results because the microorganism produces a beta lactamase. The latter substances are enzymes which cleave the beta lactam ring of penicillins and cephalosporins to give products which are devoid of antibacterial activity. However, certain substances have the ability to inhibit beta lactamases, and when a beta lactamase inhibitor is used in combination with a penicillin or cephalosporin it can increase or enhance the antibacterial effectiveness of the penicillin or cephalosporin against certain microorganisms. It is considered that there is an enhancement of antibacterial effectiveness when the antibacterial activity of a combination of a beta lactamase inhibiting substance and a beta lactam antibiotic is significantly greater than the sum of the antibacterial activities of the individual components. Thus, according to the invention, there are provided new compounds which are 6 substituted methylenepencillanic acids, their 1 oxides, 1,1 dioxides and esters thereof readily hydrolyzable Still further, there are provided derivatives of 6 substituted methylenepenicillanic acids, their 1 oxides and 1,1 dioxides having a carboxy protecting group, said compounds being useful as chemical intermediates. Yet further, there are provided 6 substituted hydroxymethylpenicillanic acids, their 1 oxides, 1,1 dioxides and salts and esters thereof which are useful both as chemical intermediates and as beta lactamase inhibitors.

The invention compounds of formulae I and II wherein one of the groups R², R³, R¹² or R¹³ contain a basic nitrogen atom are capable of forming acid addition salts. Such salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids are included in the invention. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, citric, malic, tartaric, maleic, fumaric, gluconic, saccharic, benzenesulfonic, Further, the compounds of formulae I and II wherein R¹ is hydrogen form cationic salts and such salts with pharmaceutically acceptable cations are included in the invention. Examples of such cations are sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and substituted ammonium salts formed with amines such as diethanolamine, choline, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N methylglucamine and procaine. This invention relates to derivatives of penicillanic acid which is represented by the following structural formula In derivatives of penicillanic acid, broken line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is below the plane of the nucleus. Such a substituent is said to be in the alpha configuration. Conversely, broad line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is above the plane of the nucleus. This latter configuration is referred to as the beta configuration. As used herein a solid line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent can be in either the alpha configuration or the beta configuration. The compounds of the invention are prepared for example, by one or more of the following general methods. The requisite Wittig salts of the formula employed in Method A, above, are either known compounds or are readily prepared from commercially available precursors by common synthetic methods, for example as illustrated below. The primary alcohols of the general formula R³CH₂OH are converted to the corresponding chloromethyl compounds, typically by reacting the alcohol with an equimolar amount of thionyl chloride in the presence or a reaction inert solvent, e.g. chloroform or methylene chloride at or about room temperature. The product is isolated, e.g., by neutralization of the reaction mixture and extraction. The chloromethyl compound, R³CH₂Cl is then converted to the desired Wittig salt e.g. by reaction with an equimolar amount of triphenylphosphine. Typically, this step is carried out in a solvent such as toluene at elevated temperature, preferably at the reflux temperature. The desired product forms a precipitate which is then collected by filtration. 6 Alpha hydroxypenicillanic acid is a known compound, see e.g., Hauser et al., The oxidation of the carboxy protected 6 alpha hydroxypenicillanate IV to the corresponding 6 oxopenicillanate ester X is typically carried out with an approximately equimolar amount of trifluoroacetic anhydride and a molar excess of dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of a reaction inert solvent, e.g., chloroform or methylene chloride. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 80 to 70 C. The reaction mixture is neutralized, e.g. by addition of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, after which the mixture is isolated, e.g. by partitioning between water and a water immiscible solvent and evaporation of the organic layer. The 6 oxopenicillanate ester of formula V is then reacted with a Wittig reagent of formula This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a reaction inert organic solvent, for example, a hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene or xylene a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,2 dibromoethane or chlorobenzene an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or t butylmethylether. While this reaction can be carried out over a range of temperature of from about 100 to 50 C., a preferred temperature is in the range of about 78 to 25 C. The desired product of formula VI, R¹ R The ester of formula VI, R¹ R As mentioned above, an especially preferred carboxy protecting group, R When sulfoxides or sulfones of the invention are desired, for example those of the formulae I wherein n is 1 or 2, the sulfides of formula VI are oxidized employing any of a wide variety of oxidants known in the art for the oxidation of sulfoxides to sulfones. However, particularly convenient reagents are metal permanganates, such as the alkali metal permanganates and the alkaline earth metal permanganates, and organic peroxy acids, such as organic peroxycarboxylic acids. Convenient individual reagents are sodium permanganate, potassium permanganate, 3 chloroperbenzoic acid and peracetic acid. A particularly preferred group of oxidants are the organic peroxy acids and a preferred organic peroxy acid is 3 chloroperbenzoic acid. When the desired oxidation product is a sulfoxide of formula I wherein n is 1, approximately molar equivalents of the starting sulfide n is zero and oxidant are employed. When the desired product is a sulfone, e.g. of formula I where n is 2, the sulfide is contacted with two or more molar equivalents of oxidant. Alternately, of course, the sulfoxides can serve as starting materials for the preparation of the corresponding sulfone, in which case at least an approximately equimolar amount of oxidant is employed. When, for example, a compound of the formula VI, R¹ R In the above mentioned oxidation procedures it is preferred to employ a starting material wherein the carboxy group is protected by the above mentioned carboxy protecting groups, R The compounds of the invention, e.g. of formula I or II , wherein R¹ is an ester forming residue readily hydrolyzable wherein R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as previously defined, they can be prepared by alkylation of the appropriate invention compound wherein R¹ is hydrogen with a halide of the formula R wherein Q is halo and R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as previously defined. The terms halide and halo are intended to mean derivatives of chlorine, bromine and iodine. The reaction is typically carried out by dissolving a salt of the compound of e.g., formula I or II wherein R¹ is hydrogen in a suitable polar organic solvent, for example, N,N dimethylformamide, and then adding about one molar equivalent of the appropriate halide R When Method B as outlined above is employed to prepare the invention compounds of formula II where n is 2 and X₃ and R¹⁸ are each hydrogen or compounds of formula VIII , the requisite 6 alpha bromo 1,1 dioxopenicillanate ester starting material IX is converted to a Grignard reagent by reaction with an equimolar amount of a low molecular weight Grignard reagent, e.g., methylmagnesium bromide, ethylmagnesium chloride or n butylmagnesium iodide, in an ethereal solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran or ethyl ether, at a temperature of from 80 to 25 C., typically 78 C. After stirring for a few minutes, an equimolar amount of the appropriate aldehyde of formula R¹²R¹³C O is added and stirring continued until the reaction is substantially complete, ordinarily from about 10 minutes to about four hours at the same temperature. The desired ester of formula II , n 2, is then isolated by standard methods. For example, the reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride and the product extracted with a water immiscible solvent. The resulting product, II , is further purified, e.g., by silica gel chromatography. The secondary alcohol of formula II , n 2, X₃ H, can then be dehydrated to provide the corresponding 6 substituted methylene 1,1 dioxopenicillanate compound of formula VIII . While a variety of methods known in the art for dehydration of secondary alcohols to olefins may be employed to successfully carry out this step, a preferred method employs conversion of the alcohol to an acetate by reaction with at least equimolar amounts of acetic anhydride and pyridine followed by stirring at room temperature for from one to ten hours to allow for formation of olefin in substantial amounts. The reaction is ordinarily quenched with water and the desired product II , n 2, is isolated by extraction methods and purified, if desired. The products of formula II , or VIII obtained as described above are esters wherein R¹ is either a carboxy protecting group, R Typically, the starting 6 alpha bromo 1,1 dioxopenicillanate esters IX are prepared from the 6,6 dibromo 1,1 dioxopenicillanic acid by treatment with sodium bicarbonate and sodium bisulfite followed by acidification. The resulting 6 alpha bromo 1,1 dioxopenicillanic acid is then converted to an ester of formula IX . The starting esters of formula X employed in Method C as outlined above, are known compounds, see, e.g. U.S. 4,234,579. In a typical procedure carried out by this method, the starting ester X in reaction inert solvent, e.g. toluene, xylene, pentane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether or mixtures thereof, is contacted at low temperature with an equimolar amount of alkyl lithium reagent, e.g., Alternatively, the above starting dibromo ester of formula X is reacted with an equimolar amount of a low molecular weight Grignard reagent, employing the same reagents and conditions described above for Method B, to provide the bromohydrin of formula XI . The bromohydrin XI can be acylated to provide the corresponding compound XII wherein R¹⁸ is other than hydrogen as defined above. Typically the acylation is carried out by reaction of equimolar amounts of acyl chloride, acyl bromide or the corresponding acid anhydride, the intermediate bromohydrin of formula XI and a tertiary amine, for example pyridine, N methylmorpholine or the like, in the presence of a reaction inert organic solvent, preferably methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate at or below room temperature. The desired diester of formula XII is then isolated by well known methods such as extraction and evaporation of solvent and purified, if desired, e.g. by column chromatography. The bromohydrin ester intermediate XI or the bromo diester XII can then be subjected to hydrogenolysis conditions to remove the bromine atom. This is accomplished by employing any of a variety of the known reducing agents and conditions such as, e.g. subjecting the bromohydrin to hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst or to reduction by means of certain organotin hydrides. Preferred organotin hydride reducing agents are the dialkyltin dihydrides, trialkyltin hydrides, having from one to six carbon atoms in each of said alkyl groups, and the triaryltin hydrides wherein said aryl is phenyl, or phenyl substituted by nitro or alkyl or alkoxy having from one to three carbon atoms. Particularly preferred are triphenyltin hydride and tri The reaction employing said tin hydrides is ordinarily carried out in the presence of a reaction inert solvent. Suitable solvents for use with the organotin hydride reducing agents are those which substantially dissolve the starting compound of formula XI or XII but do not themselves react with the hydride reducing agent. Examples of such solvents include the aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and napthalene and ethers such as ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and 1,2 dimethoxyethane. Particularly preferred solvents for reasons of economy and efficiency are benzene and toluene. In carrying out the hydrogenolysis employing organotin hydride reducing agents, equimolar amounts of bromohydrin XI or bromodiester XII and hydride is required by theory. In practice an excess of hydride, e.g., 5 50 molar excess, is often employed to assure complete reaction. The hydrogenolysis by organotin hydrides proceeds to substantial completion under the preferred conditions disclosed above without use of a catalyst. However, the reaction is expedited by means of a source of free radicals such as, e.g, ultraviolet light, or a catalytic amount of azobisisobutyronitrile or peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide. A catalytic amount of azobisisobutyronitrile is a preferred source of free radicals for this reaction. Typically, the compound of formula XI or XII is dissolved in reaction inert solvent, the solution is maintained under an inert atmosphere, e.g. a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, and the appropriate amount of organotin hydride and, optionally, the source of free radicals, e.g. azobisisobutyronitrile, added and the resulting mixture stirred at a temperature within the preferred range of from about 0 C. up to the boiling point of the solvent. The reaction is ordinarily complete in from a few minutes to about a few hours, e.g., from 5 minutes at the boiling point of benzene to about 20 hours at 0 C. The product of formula II, X₃ H is then isolated by methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, by evaporation of solvent and silica gel chromatography of the residue. The compounds of formula II, X₃ H formed by organotin hydride debromination as described above, have been found to be predominantly the 6 beta isomers, that is, the 6 R¹²R¹³C OR¹⁸ substituent is in the beta configuration. When the hydrogenolysis step is carried out employing hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, a convenient method for carrying out this transformation is to stir or shake a solution of a compound of the formula XI or XII under an atmosphere of hydrogen, or hydrogen mixed with an inert diluent such as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a noble metal hydrogenolysis catalyst. Suitable solvents for this hydrogenolysis reaction are those which substantially dissolve the starting compound of the formula XI or XII but which do not themselves suffer hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis. Examples of such solvents include ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and 1,2 dimethoxyethane low molecular weight esters such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate tertiary amides such as When the hydrogenolysis is substantially complete, the desired product of formula II, X₃ H is then isolated by standard methods, e.g., the catalyst is removed by filtration, the solvent evaporated and the product purified, if desired, by well known methods such as crystallization or by chromatography. When the starting compound of formula XI or XII is a benzyl ester R¹ R The 6 substituted hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid or ester of formula XII or II, X₃ H where n is zero, can be oxidized by any of the methods known to convert sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones, for example by means of 3 chloroperbenzoic acid as described above, to provide the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone of formula XII OR II, X₃ H and where in each n is 1 or 2, respectively. However, a preferred method for obtaining sulfones of formula XI , XII or II is by employing the appropriate 6,6 dibromo 1,1 dioxopenicillanate ester X where n 2 as starting material in the above described Method C. The starting aldehydes of formula R¹²R¹³CO wherein R¹² and R¹³ are as defined above are either available from a commercial source or are readily prepared from available starting materials by methods well known in the art, e.g. As indicated above, the compounds of the formulae I or II wherein R¹ is H, and salts thereof, in combinations with beta lactam antibiotics, show synergistic activity in Those compounds of the formulae I and II , where R¹ is H, and salts thereof, in combinations with known beta lactam antibiotics are useful as industrial antimicrobials, for example in water treatment, slime control, paint preservation and wood preservation, as well as for topical application as disinfectants. In the case of use of these compounds for such an application, it is often convenient to admix the active ingredient with a non toxic carrier, such as vegetable or mineral oil or an emollient cream. Similarly, they can be dissolved or dispersed in liquid diluents or solvents such as water, alkanols, glycols or mixtures thereof. In most instances it is appropriate to employ concentrations of the active ingredient of from about 0.1 percent to about 10 percent by weight, based on total composition. As also indicated above, the compounds of the formulae I and II wherein R¹ is R The compounds of the formulae I and II wherein R¹ is hydrogen or the residue of an ester group readily hydrolyzable The ability of said compounds of formulae I and II to enhance the effectiveness of a beta lactam antibiotic against beta lactamase producing bacteria makes them valuable for co administration with beta lactam antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, particularly man. In the treatment of a bacterial infection, the compound of the formula I or II can be co mingled with the beta lactam antibiotic, or in the case where R When using a compound of formula I or II wherein R¹ is R When using said compounds of formula I or II in combination with another beta lactam antibiotic, said compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, i.e. intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Although the prescribing physician will ultimately decide the dosage to be used in a human subject, the ratio of the daily dosages of the compound of formula I or II , wherein R¹ is R As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, some beta lactam compounds are effective when administered orally or parenterally, while others are effective only when administered by the parenteral route. When a compound of formula I or II is to be used simultaneously i.e. co mingled with a beta lactam antibiotic which is effective only on parenteral administration, a combination formulation suitable for parenteral use will be required. When a compound of formula I or II is to be used simultaneously co mingled with a beta lactam antibiotic which is effective orally or parenterally, combinations suitable for either oral or parenteral administration can be prepared. Additionally, it is possible to administer preparations of the active compounds of formula I or II orally, while at the same time administering a further beta lactam antibiotic parenterally and it is also possible to administer preparations of said compounds of formula I or II parenterally, while at the same time administering the further beta lactam antibiotic orally. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific details of these examples.
