# A method of cutting a polymer film and a device for web cutting.

## Abstract
This method of cutting a polymer film F is based upon relative linear or primary movement between the film F and a cutting edge 22 in a film cutting position and uses no secondary cutting motion films having a thickness in the range of from 10 micrometers to 500 micrometers are used and the cutting edge 22 is a substantially continuous edge 22 at the periphery 21 of a substantially circular steel sheet disc 20 having a thickness in the range of from 10 micrometers to 500 micrometers and a diameter in the range of from 10 millimeters to 100 millimeters the disc 20 is maintained for a first and preferably predetermined length of cutting operation in a first position where a predetermined first incremental portion of the cutting edge 22 is in film cutting position then, disc 20 is indexed, i.e. step switched, for removing the first incremental portion of cutting edge 22 from the film cutting position and for moving a subsequent incremental portion 23 of cutting edge 22 into film cutting position then the subsequent portion 23 is held in position for another length of cutting operation this indexing step is repeated until a major part, at least, of the substantially continuous edge 22 of steel sheet disc 20 has been indexed. The subject web cutting device 2 has an indexing blade in the form of a substantially circular steel sheet disc 20 having a a substantially uniform thickness in the range of from 10 micrometers to 500 micrometers, b a diameter in the range of from 10 millimeters to 100 millimeters, and c a substantially continuous cutting edge 22 extending around the periphery 21 of disc 20 .
