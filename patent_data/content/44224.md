## Description
DISEASE CONTROL IN PLANTS My prior Patent Application PCT GB 79 00050, published asWO 79 00838, describes inter alia the increase in the efficacy of agricnltnral growth regulators used in combination with certain metabolic additives, viz. a a carbohydrate source, e.g. glucose, hydrolysed starch, sucrose, fructose, glycerol, glyceraldehyde, erythrose, ribulose, Eyulose or arabinose or an ester or glycoside or metabolic equivalent of such a carbohydrate, which will normally be applied at 10 to 10,000 g ha grams per hectare b an organic acid of the Krebs Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle or a metabolic precursor thereof, including citric, succinici malic, pyravic, acetic and fumaric acids , which will normally be applied at similar rates to the carbohydrate source c a vitamin or coenzyme, e.g. ascorbic acid, thiamine riboflavin, pyridosine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, nicotinamide, folic acid, or a precursor thereof including nicotinic acid, which will normally be applied at 0.01 to 500 aha d a purine or pyrimidine nucleoside, nucleotide or a metabolic precursor thereof, e.g. adesine, adencsine, thymine, thymidine, cytosine, gaanine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, uracil uridine or inosine, which will normally be applied at 1 to 500 g ha e a fatty acid of a type found in natural saturated and unsaturated fats, e.g. butyric, lauric, palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acid, which will normally be applied at 10 to 10,000 giha i a naturally occurring fat or oil including olive, soya, coconut and corn oils, which can be degraded by living organisms to fatty acids and which will normal be applied at 10 to 10,000 g ha and g an amino acid of a type that occurs naturally in plant proteins, e.g. glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, repine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, asparagine, lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine, Mitidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, proline or hydroxy proline, which will normally be applied at 1 to 500 g ha. 4 subsequent Patent Applicatian PCT GB 80 00116, published as WO 81 00187, further describes the use of such metabolic additives in combination with a coating agent, ior example di 1 menthene or a related terpene. Such Such coating agents include but are not limited to the iollowing s I di 1 p di l enthene a terpene sold under the trade names of Miller Gard, Vapor Gard and Miller Aide 2 acrylic polymers, including copolymers, e.g. poly acrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile, poly methyl methacrylate and poly ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate 3 cellulose ethers, e.g. hydroxethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 4 cellulose esters, e.g. methyl cellulose 5 epoxy resins, e.g. Epikote 828 and Epikote 1001 6 hydrocarbon resins, e.g. petroleum resins 7j polyester and polyether resins 8 polyamide resins 9 rubbers, e.g. natural rubber, polyurethane, butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, polychloroprene, and rubber oil fraline 10 silicone resins and polymers 11 styrene polymers, including copolymers, e.g. polystyrene and styrene butadiene 12 thermosetting polymers, e.g. melam ne formaldehyde copolymer, phenol formaldehyde resins and urea formaldehyde resins 13 vinyl polymers, including copolymers, e.g. polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butyral, poly vinyl pyrrolidone, poly vinyl acetate vinyl chloride and poly vinyl acetate acrylate and 14 natural drying oils, e.g. linseed and linseed tung oils. The coating agents themselves are applied in water at from 250 ml to 62 litres per hectare of coating agent. The amount of water per hectare in which this quantity of coating agent is used varies depending on the method of application. In aerial or controlled droplet application, the amount of water is in the range 20 to 120 litres per hectare about 2 to 10 Imperial gallons per acre in using conventional ground spray equipment, the amount of water is in the range 110 to 5600 litres per hectare about 10 to 500 Imperial gallons per acre . In using the coating agents as disclosed in WO 81 00187, it is possible to apply a fungicide or growth regulator in the autumn in order to affect fungal and plant development both then and in the ensuing spring, thus, by a single application, effectively treating the plant at two discrete growth periods with an intervening period during which no significant growth of plant fungus takes place. It has now been discovered that the treatment of crop plants with a growth regulator such as chlorocholine chloride in combination with the metabolic additives described in WO 79 00838 has a surprising and unexpected effect upon fungal development on the crop plant. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of killing or inhibiting fungi on growing plants, comprising applying to the plants a growth regulator, together with a coating agent and or a metabolic additive of the types defined above. Although neither chlorocholine chloride nor the metabolic additive used is significantly fungicidally active at the rate of application involved, a decrease in the development of fungal pathogens results and lasts for many weeks after treatment. when a coating agent, particularly di l menthene or a related terpene, is used in combination with the growth regulator there is a further decrease in the development of fungal pathogens.The coating agent at the rate applied is not itself signiiicantly fungicidal, nor is it acting as a physical barrier to fungal development, since the control of fungal pathogens extends to a time when the plant has grown at Least five times the size that it was at application and has formed many new yet still protected leaves. Thus there is a synergistic action between the coating agent and the growth regulator foruulation. While it is not possible at present to be certain as to how the effect is produced it seems likely that it results from action on the plant s hormonal system leading to greater resistance to fungal infection. This technique is applicable to a wide range of crop and ornamental plants including, but not limited to, small grain cereals, e.g. wheat, rice and barley large grain cereals, e.g. maize potatoes sugar beet sugar cane and fruit bearing trees and bushes.
