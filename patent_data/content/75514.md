## Description
CAT IONIC POLYMERS AND SURFACTANTS SILICA POLYMERIZATION RETARDANTS AND DISPERSANTS Background of the Invention Silica deposition in aqueous systems, for example cooling towers and hypersaline geothermal brines, has been a continual problem. They have, historically, been cleaned by blow down. If deposition occurs, mechanical removal has been the method used. Obviously, this causes loss of time and increased energy and labor costs. pH affects the ionization of silanol groups and, therefore, affects the polymerization rate. Silica first forms, then three dimensional networks and, eventually, colloidal particles grow through condensation. At pH 7, nuclei formation and particle growth is very rapid. The pH of cooling water is generally 6.0 to 8.5 and the water temperature is generally about 30 to 70 C. The pH of geothermal brines is generally 4.0 to 6.0 and the brine temperature is generally about 100 to 2100C. It is known to use cationic polymers or cationic surfactants as silica scale inhibitors in hypersaline geothermal brines Harrar, J.E. et al, Final Report on Tests of Proprietary Chemical Additives asAnti scalants for Hypersaline Geothermal Brine ,January 1980, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Harrar,J.E. et al, On Line Tests of Organic Additives for the Inhibition of the Precipitation of Silica fromHypersaline Geothermal Brine IV.

Description of the Invention The instant invention is directed to a method of retarding the polymerization and formation of silica deposits in cooling water applications comprising adding to the cooling water a polymerization inhibiting concentration of a mixture of an inhibitor selected from the group consisting of cationic polymer, cationic surfactant, or mixtures thereof. The instant invention is also directed to a method of retarding the polymerization and formation of silica deposits in an aqueous system comprising adding to the water a polymerization inhibiting concentration of a mixture of a at least one branched cationic polymer and b at least one cationic surfactant or linear cationic polymer. The instant invention is also directed to a mixture of a at least one branched cationic polymer and b and at least one cationic surfactant or linear cationic polymer. The use of cationic polymers and or cationic surfactants is, thus, proposed for retarding silica polymerization and preventing silica deposition in cooling water applications. Synergism was found in the use of a mixture of branched cationic polymer and cationic surfactant and or linear cationic polymer in retarding silica polymerization and preventing silica deposition in both cooling water and geothermal brines applications. The inhibitor is added in a concentration of, preferably, 1.5 to 100 ppm active most preferably 2 to 50 ppm. The inhibitor retards polymerization of the silica and thus, retards its precipitation and subsequent deposition. Any cationic polymer may be used in cooling water applications. Examples include homopolymers of the following dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, ethyleneimine, methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium methosulfate and diquaternary ionene.
