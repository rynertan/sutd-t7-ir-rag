## Description
This invention relates generally to cryogenic amplifying switching devices and more specifically relates to a superconducting transistor. The prior art shows a number of three terminal, transistor like devices formed from layered structures. Some require the use of metals operating in a superconducting mode while others require the use of normal metals or combinations of such metals. In addition, some of these structures call for the use of tunnel barriers, insulators or crystalline materials which separate the metals one from the other. To the extent that such prior art arrangements have not come into wide use, it is apparent that they are lacking in certain qualities which are present in known semiconductor transistor devices. Apart from this, while three terminal, cryogenic devices have appeared in the prior art, for reasons like poor gain and lack of isolation, none of these devices have filled the need for a transistor like device operating in the cryogenic environment. U.S. Patent 3,155,886 filed August 16, 1961 shows three superconductors separated by a pair of tunnel barriers. In this instance, the tunnel barrier between the second and third superconductor is a high band gap material. U.S. Patent 3,204,115 filed July 31, 1961 shows an arrangement similar to the 886 reference. One difference is that the first and third materials are normal metals. U.S. Patent 3,275,844 filed November 16, 1962 discloses a transistor like structure similar to the 886 reference except that all metals are normal metals. U.S. Patent 3,372,315 filed August 4, 1965 shows a device similar to the 844 reference except that the second insulator is a single crystal material mica and has a low energy barrier height. This device was intended to run at room temperature. While the reference calls for a low barrier, in reality, the barrier height is rather high 0.8 0.95eV relative to that required .005eV for the semiconductor of the present application. In addition, the reference has no requirement for a superconducting base. U.S. Patent 3,178,594 filed June 27, 1962 shows a transistor like device wherein the middle metal film is required to be superconducting whereas the other two may be normal or superconducting. The insulators between films are, however, both high energy gap materials and of a thickness which permits tunneling. U.S. Patent 4,157,555 filed November 7, 1977 shows a superconducting transistor composed of three thin films of superconducting material separated from each other by insulating oxides of a thickness sufficient to permit tunneling. One junction is biased above twice the superconducting energy gap and the other is biased at less than twice the superconducting energy gap. Injection of quasiparticles into the center film by one junction provides a current gain in the second junction. The semiconductor layer of the present application improves a current gain in the second junction. The semiconductor layer of the present application improves on this reference by blocking the return flow of quasiparticles thereby keeping the common base current gain equal to or less than one. Also, in the present application, there is no tunneling between the base and collector regions. By providing a low energy barrier material, the transmission of quasiparticles is encouraged while the passage of Cooper pairs is inhibited. U.S. Patent 4,334,158 filed June 6, 1980 shows a three terminal device called a QUITERON in which the superconducting gap of a superconducting material is caused to vanish by the injection of excess quasiparticles. The device uses a pair of tunnel barriers, i.e., an injection barrier and an acceptor barrier, both of which may consist of a semiconductive material. It should be appreciated that in this reference, the semiconductor has no other function than its use as a tunnel barrier. To the extent that the device of this reference suffers from poor input output isolation, the device of the present application, in addition to having gain, has excellent input output isolation. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a three terminal, transistor like device which exhibits gain and has excellent input output isolation. Another object is to provide a three terminal, transistor like device which exhibits good linearity and has low power dissipation. Still another object is to provide a three terminal, transistor like device which exhibits high speed switching at cryogenic temperatures. Yet another object is to provide a three terminal, transistor like device which can be formed into high density integrated circuits. The invention as claimed is intended to meet these objectives and to remedy the drawbacks encountered with hitherto known devices. The transistor in accordance with the invention comprises a superconducting base and a collector isolated from the base by a semiconductor element. The latter, in addition to providing excellent input output isolation, permits the flow of quasiparticles while simultaneously inhibiting the passage of Cooper pairs. In a preferred embodiment, the structure is a three terminal device which incorporates three metal layers, serving as emitter, base and collector electrodes, respectively. The first and second of the three layers are separated by an insulating tunnel barrier or any other barrier suitable for the injection of quasiparticles and the second and third layers are separated by a semiconductor layer of a thickness sufficient to inhibit tunneling. The semiconductor layer has a low barrier height which is sufficient to permit the passage of quasiparticles from the second layer while simultaneously inhibiting the passage of Cooper pairs. The second layer is a superconductor while the first and third layers may be superconductors, normal metals or degenerate semiconductors. The second and third layers are connected to the semiconductor layer by means of ohmic contacts. In one embodiment, the first layer or emitter is formed from aluminium while the second and third layers otherwise characterized as the base and collector, respectively, are made of tantalum. A barrier layer of tantalum oxide Ta₂O₅ separates the first and second layers and is sufficiently thin to permit tunneling between these layers. A layer of semiconductor such as p type gallium antimonide GaSb or indium antimonide InSb is disposed between the second and third layers and has an energy barrier height sufficient to permit the passage of quasiparticles. While the semiconductor layer should have a thickness sufficient to inhibit the tunneling of Cooper pairs, it should also be thin enough so that the effects of impact ionization are negligible. In the above described device, the ohmic contacts, which are necessary to achieve the desired current flow, are obtained by virtue of the fact that gallium antimonide and indium antimonide naturally form ohmic contacts with most metals, including tantalum. Finally, means for switching the flow of quasiparticles is connected to the resulting device. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly the good input output isolation and the fast operation of the device which is due to the small dimensions made possible by the simple structure and the inherent properties of the carrier transport mechanism used in the device. The achieved low power consumption allows high package density and thus high system speeds. Several ways of carrying out the invention are described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate a specific embodiment of the invention and in which The superconducting transistor described hereinbelow comprises a superconducting base and a semiconductor isolated collector. The cryogenic transistor is basically a five layer device consisting of a layer of metal such as aluminium, a tunnel barrier comprising an insulator like tantalum oxide Ta₂O₅ , a layer of metal such as tantalum which must be superconducting, a layer of semiconductor material such as p type gallium antimonide or indium antimonide which is thick enough to inhibit tunneling and has an energy barrier height sufficient to permit the flow of quasiparticles while simultaneously inhibiting the passage of Cooper pairs, and a final layer of metal like tantalum. Also included are the ohmic contacts which form between the tantalum layers and the semiconductor. In another embodiment, the first three layers are the same as in the first embodiment but the semiconductor is p type germanium and the last metal layer is aluminum. In both embodiments, the metal layers contacting the semiconductor material either form an ohmic contact naturally as is the case with tantalum and gallium antimonide or indium antimonide and aluminum and germanium or an ohmic contact is formed between tantalum and germanium by first diffusing aluminum into the surface of germanium to which a tantalum contact is to be made. By applying appropriate biases between the metal layers which can also be characterized as emitter, base and collector layers, quasiparticles which are injected into the superconducting base will pass to the collector terminal. The carriers which appear at the collector are prevented from returning to the superconducting base by the barrier height of the semiconductor material. The resulting device is capable of high speed switching and exhibits high gain and has excellent input output isolation. As used in the following description, the term Cooper pairs shall refer to the paired electrons or holes in a superconductor below its critical temperature. The term quasiparticle shall refer to an unpaired electron or hole in a superconductor. It should be noted that quasiparticles exhibit a mixture of electron like and hole like properties. It should also be understood that when one, for simplicity, refers to quasiparticles passing through a semiconductor, a more complete physical description is that when a quasiparticle enters a semiconductor, it becomes definitely either a hole or an electron. It is this electron or hole which passes through the semiconductor. Referring now to FIG. 1 there is shown a cryogenic, three terminal, transistor like device 1 which includes metallic layers 2, 3, 4 which are otherwise characterized in FIG. 1 as emitter, base and collector, respectively. Layers 2, 3 are spaced from each other by a layer 5 of insulating material which is of a thickness sufficient to permit the tunneling of charge carriers through it. A layer 6 of semiconductor material is disposed between layers 3, 4 which is doped such that under suitable bias conditions, it presents essentially no energy barrier to the passage of hole like quasiparticles but successfully blocks the passage of electron like quasiparticles and Cooper pairs. Layer 6 must have a thickness sufficient to inhibit the tunneling of quasiparticles and Cooper pairs through it and yet be sufficiently thin that effects due to impact ionization are negligible. Impact ionization effects may also be decreased by the suitable choice of a doping profile in layer 6. Layers 3, 4 are connected to layer 6 by means of ohmic contacts which form naturally as a result of the materials being used or are formed using a material which is interposed between the metal of layer 3 and the semiconductor of layer 6. In the arrangement of FIG. 1, layer 3 otherwise characterized as a base must be superconducting while layers 2, 4 otherwise characterized as emitter, collector, respectively, may be superconducting, normal metals or degenerate semiconductors. To render device 1 conductive, a bias which makes emitter 2 positive with respect to base 3 is applied from bias source 7 between base 3 and emitter 2 via terminal 8 of double pole switch 9. A second bias source 10 applies a bias between layers 2 and layer 4 via load device 11 which renders layer 4 or the collector negative relative to layer 3 or the base. The specific operating voltages which will be defined hereinafter in detail cause quasiparticles to be injected into layer 3 from layer 2. The quasiparticles have sufficient energy to pass over the low energy barrier provided by the semiconductor of layer 6 and flow as holes, in the example given, to layer 4 where they are collected. If switch 9 is connected to terminal 12 thereof instead of terminal 8, layers 2, 3 are shorted and device 1 is rendered nonconductive. To render the base superconducting, device 1 is submerged in liquid helium which provides a temperature of approximately 2 Kelvin 1 2 TC 2 K for Ta . Under such circumstances, semiconductor layer 6 experiences a phenomenon called carrier freeze out and effectively acts as an insulator with respect to thermally generated charges. The primary reason for operating device 1 well below the transition temperature of the superconducting base is that this results in a very low thermal quasiparticle density in the superconducting base resulting in low leakage current between the collector and the base. In a preferred embodiment, layer 2 may be made of aluminum while layers 3, 4 may be made of tantalum. Layer 5 may be made of tantalum oxide Ta₂O₅ and should have a thickness in the range of 1 10 nm to permit quasiparticle tunneling through it. Layer 6 of semiconductor may be a p type semiconductor such as gallium or indium antimonide and may have a thickness in the range of 100 1000 nm. Thicknesses in this range prevent tunneling and render negligible the effects of impact ionization. Semiconductor layer 6 is doped with a dopant such as carbon to a level of 10¹⁵ 10¹⁶cm ³. Broadly speaking, the doping level should be such as to render the semiconductor not quite degenerate with the edge of its conduction or valence band approximately lined up with the upper or lower edge of the gap of the superconducting layer 3. Layer 3, otherwise characterized in FIG. 1 as the base, may have a thickness which is as thin as possible consistent with the formation of a continuous layer of tantalum. Thicknesses in the order of 10 30 nm are suitable. Using the materials just described, the tantalum of layers 3, 4 when deposited on gallium or indium antimonide naturally forms an ohmic contact with the semiconductor material. The use of ohmic contacts allows electrons or holes to move freely from layer 3 to layer 4 at only millielectron volt meV energy levels. Layers 2, 4 may be of any reasonable thickness consistent with the overall device design. In another embodiment, layers 2, 3 and 5 may be made of the same materials as the layers of the first embodiment discussed hereinabove. Layer 6, however, may be made of a p type semiconductor such as germanium which is doped to near degeneracy with the dopant such as boron. Finally, layer 4 may be made of tantalum. To the extent that aluminum readily forms an ohmic contact with p type germanium when annealed, no special processing is required. However, because tantalum does not directly form an ohmic contact with germanium, aluminum is first diffused at a temperature of 300 C into the surface of the germanium to form a shallow degenerate Schottky contact. In a subsequent step, tantalum is deposited and an ohmic contact results. Both of the above described devices are layered structures and it is well within the skill of those versed in the semiconductor arts to form the structure of FIG. 1. Well known techniques such as vacuum deposition, molecular beam epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition may be used. In a simple approach, a wafer of gallium antimonide is thinned in the location where one wishes to make a device using a chemical etch down to about 500 nm in thickness. This might be aided by the use of an epitaxial layer of the desired thickness at which the etching would stop. The thinned portion of the wafer is then subjected to the deposition of tantalum on both sides forming ohmic contacts with the gallium antimonide or indium antimonide. In a subsequent step, one layer of tantalum is masked while the other is subjected to an oxidation process which forms a tunnel barrier layer of tantalum oxide. In a final step, aluminum is deposited on the tantalum oxide and electrodes are applied to the various layers to apply biases thereto which will cause device 1 to switch. Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown an energy band diagram of the device of FIG. 1 in an unbiased state. Layer 2, which acts as the emitter of device 1, is intended to inject quasiparticles through the tunnel barrier of layer 5 into layer 3 which acts as the superconducting base. With device 1 operating well below the superconducting transition temperature of layer 3, the superconducting gap, Δ, of layer 3 prevents significant current from flowing until the bias between layers 2, 3 is of the order of the superconducting gap which is the threshold level of device 1. Referring now to FIG. 3, the energy band diagram for device 1 in the biased condition is shown. Once a voltage of the order of the superconducting gap, Δ, is applied between layers 2, 3, the quasiparticles that are injected into layer 3 from layer 2 readily pass on through superconductor layer 3 into layer 6 of semiconductor which effectively isolates collector layer 4 from base layer 3. To the extent that Cooper pairs are formed by recombination of quasiparticles injected from emitter layer 2, such Cooper pairs lie well above the valence band or well below the conduction band of semiconductor layer 6 depending on whether the semiconductor is p or n type and they are of insufficient energy to exceed the energy barrier of the semiconductor material. Also, the Cooper pairs are prevented from tunneling to collector layer 4 in as much as the thickness of semiconductor layer 6 is sufficiently great to prevent Cooper pair tunneling. In this way, undesired base to collector leakage current is minimized when a bias is applied between collector and base in the absence of quasiparticle injection from emitter layer 2. Because superconducting base layer 3 is thin its thickness is of the same order as its mean free path , injected quasiparticles readily pass on through superconducting layer 3 into semiconductor layer 6. Then, provided that the energy bands of the semiconductor are as shown in FIG. 3 i.e., nearly, but not quite degenerate with the edge of the valence band approximately lined up with the edge of the gap of the superconductor , the application of a voltage bias between base layer 3 and collector layer 4 results in all of the carriers which enter semiconductor layer 6 being swept into collector layer 4. Thus, almost all of the current injected from emitter layer 2 arrives at collector layer 4 minus only a small amount which goes into base layer 3 due to recombination of the quasiparticles. For the bands as shown in FIG. 3, there is essentially no threshold collector base bias voltage and there is excellent isolation. The collector current is nearly independent of collector base voltage from sub millivolt biases up to the biases of the order of tens of millivolts. The maximum useful voltage depends on the band curvature at the interface between superconducting layer 3 and semiconductor layer 6 and on the width of the latter. It is important that semiconductor layer 6 be wide enough so that no direct tunneling occurs between base layer 3 and collector layer 4 for the desired operating voltages. It is also important, for optimum operation, that semiconductor layer 6 not be too close to degenerate since this would result in excessive leakage between base layer 3 and collector layer 4. At this point, it is emphasized that the contacts between layers 3, 4 and layer 6 are either true ohmic contacts or shallow, degenerate Schottky contacts which act as ohmic contacts. This is very important for the operation of device 1 since it permits holes to move freely from base layer 3 to collector layer 4 at only meV energy levels. The gain of device 1 is determined entirely by the recombination rate of quasiparticles as they pass through base layer 3. Thus, if a fraction, f, of the current injected from emitter layer 2 recombines to form Cooper pairs, the following relations should hold Where, for example, if f .05, the common emitter current gain β 19. Typical operating voltages for device 1 are Emitter to base voltage is 1 millivolt where the emitter is biased positive relative to the base. Collector to base voltage is between 0 20 millivolts where the collector is negative relative to the base. It should be appreciated that device 1 can also be made using ohmic contacts to the conduction band of an n type semiconductor. The band diagrams for such a device, with and without biasing, would basically be mirror images of the band diagrams shown in FIGS. 2, 3 with the biases reversed from that shown in connection with FIG. 1. The superconducting base, semiconductor isolated device 1 described hereinabove should have excellent linearity, very wide dynamic range, high gain, low threshold and low power dissipation. In addition, the resulting devices should have high speed, excellent input output isolation and provide high packing density in the integrated circuit environment. While a superconductor or normal metal has been shown as the emitter electrode which injects quasiparticles through a tunnel barrier into the superconducting base, it should be appreciated that other techniques for injecting such quasiparticles may be used. For example, light of appropriate energy may be applied directly to the superconducting base to break Cooper pairs which action provides the necessary quasiparticles.
