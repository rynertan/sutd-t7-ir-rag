# A method of joining a pair of metal parts.

## Abstract
In a method of joining a pair of metal parts 11,12 one of the parts 12 is provided with an insulative coating 14 at its surface to be joined to the other part 11 , while the joining surface of the other part 11 is free of any coating and defines a plurality of substantially parallel, longitudinally extending spines 13 . To effect the required join, the joining surfaces of the parts 11,12 are urged into interengagement and are simultaneously caused to undergo relative vibrational movement in a direction substantially parallel with the splines 13 on said other part 11 .
