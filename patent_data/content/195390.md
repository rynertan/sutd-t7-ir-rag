# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PREVENTING AN ELECTRIC ALTERNATING CURRENT GENERATOR FROM FALLING OUT OF STEP

## Abstract
Method for preventing an electric alternating current generator from falling out of step. According to the invention a transformer TR with controllable phase shift α is connected between said generator G and an a.c. network N . Sensing members TG, SC, INT1 form a measure of the load angle δ of the generator G and its rate of change dδ dt . The attainment of a predetermined point, suitably the maximum point, of the power load angle characteristic of the generator is sensed by means of a differentiating circuit DM and level detecting ND1 means. The attainment of this working point initiates a change of the phase shaft α of the transformer with the same rate as the rate of change dδ dt of the load angle δ of the generator. Sensing members ND2 sense when the load angle velocity has dropped to a low value, preferably zero, whereupon the change of the phase shift of the transformer is interrupted. In this way, the risk of the generator to fall out of step is effectively prevented for certain types of faults, for example short circuits in the a.c. network.
