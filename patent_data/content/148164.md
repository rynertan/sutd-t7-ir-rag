# DIGITIZER FOR AN IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An analog video signal obtained from a television camera having a 4 3 aspect ratio is converted into a square array of N N square pixels corresponding to the pixel content in the center of the television camera by apparatus which includes an analog to digital converter 201 having as its analog input 203 the analog output signal of the television camera and providing a sampled digital data output 209 , the converter having an encode input 205 and a data ready output 207 in addition to its analog video input and digital data output. A synchronization recovery circuit 211 is coupled to the video input and adapted to extract from the composite signal a composite synchronization signal containing line synchronization information, frame synchronization information and field index information. An interface circuit is coupled to the encode input 205 to the analog to digital converter 201 and the data ready output 207 , and receives the data output of the converter for converting the 4 3 aspect ratio of the television camera into a square image corresponding to a square in the center of the screen containing a square array of N N square pixels.
