## Description
in water to the point of initiation of the dissolution is very short, and since the dissolution rate is very high, the fiber is dissolved out in a very short time after dipping in water or the strength of the fiber is lost in a very short time. This time is ordinarily two hours or shorter. There has been proposed a method in which the hydrophilic nature of such a water soluble fiber is modified so that the fiber is prevented from being completely dissolved. In this proposal, the fiber is not dissolved out but the reduction of the strength is ordinarily controlled to a certain reduction ratio in the range of from 30 to 60 .Furthermore, this certain reduction ratio is ordinarily reached within 2 hours after immersion in water. This dissolution time or reduction ratio depends on the temperature, and the higher the temperature, the shorter the dissolution time and the higher the strength reduction ratig. A water swelling fiber such as rayon, cellulose or cellulose acetate is not dissolved out but degradation is stopped at a certain strength reduction ratio, e.g., 20 to 50 , and this certain strength reduction ratio is ordinarily reached within 2 hours. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a fiber, the strength of which is gradually reduced with the lapse of time when it is immersed in water or is wet with water. By the expression gradually reduced with the lapse of time used herein, it is meant that the time required for initiation of degradation after immersion in water is longer than in a conventional water soluble or water swelling fiber, the dissolution rate is low, and the time required for the dissolution is long. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a wet degradable fiber having a covering resin layer, wherein the moisture permeability R of a resin WET DEGRADABtE FIBERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a wet degradable fiber. More particularly, it relates to a fiber, the strength of which is gradually reduced with the lapse of time when the fiber is in the wet state or immersed in water. 2. Description of the Prior Art As the fiber of which the strength is reduced in water or in the state wet with water, there are known fibers of water soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol and fibers of waterswelling polymers having hydrophilic groups, such as rayon, cellulose, and cellulose acetate. Reduction of the strength in water or dissolution in water in these fibers is industrially utilized in various fields. For example, because of an excellent water solubility, a polyvinyl alcohol fiber is used as an adhesive binder, a cracking preventing agent in a molded article, a fiber for a crepe fabric, a fiber for a chemical lace fabric, a marking fiber for a knitted fabric, a selvage curl preventing fiber for a woven or knitted fabric, a fiber for preventing extension of an elastic yarn, and a fiber for pressing a strongly twisted yarn. These known fibers, however, are commonly characterized in that degradation of the strength is manifested in a very short time after immersion in water, or the strength is reduced to a certain level in a short time after immersion in water and then further reduction of the strength is halted. The time required for initiation of the reduction of the strength after immersion in water is very short, and the degradation or dissolution is completed in a very short time.For example, in the case of a water soluble fiber composed of polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol, the time from the point of immersion forming the covering layer is at least 2.5 g mÃª.24 hours as determined at a relative humidity difference of 0 90 with respect to a thickness of 0.1 mm, and the strength wet reduction ratio AS of the fiber is within a range satisfying requirements represented by the following formulae 0 AS 70 , 20 AS2 100 and AS2 AS1 1.10 wherein aS1 represents the strength reduction ratio after two hours immersion in water at 200C and AS2 represents the strength reduction ratio after fifty hours immersion in water at 200C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The wet degradable fiber of the present invention has a moisture permeable covering resin layer. As the skeleton fiber on which this moisture permeable covering resin layer is formed, there can be mentioned a fiber in which reduction of the strength is advanced in the wet state, such as a water soluble fiber or a water swellable fiber, and a fiber which is hydrolyzed in the wet state in the presence of a hydrolysis promoter such as an amine to advance deterioration or degradation of the fiber, such as a polyester fiber. By the term water soluble fibers used herein is meant a fiber which is dissolved when it is immersed in water at a temperature higher than OOC, with the result that the strength of the fiber is reduced as compared with the strength in air. This fiber may be composed of a natural polymer, a semi synthetic polymer, or a synthetic polymer. For example, there can be mentioned polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, sodium polyacrylate, and collagen. By the term water wetting fiber used herein is meant a fiber which is not dissolved but swollen when it is immersed in water at a temperature higher than 0 C, with the result that the strength of the fiber is reduced as compared with the strength in air. This fiber also may be composed of a natural polymer, a semi synthetic polymer, or a synthetic polymer. For example, there can be mentioned rayon, cellulose acetate, Vinylon, wool, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, sodium polyacrylate, and collagen. As the fiber which is hydrolyzed in the wet state in the presence of a hydrolysis promoter such as an amine, there can be used a polyester fiber, that is, a fiber composed of a polymer having ester bonds in the main chain. For example, there can be mentioned a polyester comprising terephthalic acid as the main acid component and at least one glycol, preferably at least one alkylene glycol selected from ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, pentamethylene glycol, and hexamethylene glycol, as the main glycol component. A polyester in which a part of the terephthalic acid component is replaced by another bifunctional carboxylic acid component also can be used, and a polyester in which a part of the glycol component is substituted by a diol component other than the above mentioned glycol also can be used. As the bifunctional carboxylic acid other than terephthalic acid, there can be mentioned aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic bifunctional carboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid, napthalene dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl dicarboxylic acid, diphenoxyethane dicarboxylic acid, B hydroxyethoxybenzoic acid, p hydroxybenzoic acid, 5 sodium sulfoisophthalic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, and 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid. As the diol compound other than the above mentioned glycol, there can be mentioned aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic diol compounds such as cyclohexane 1,4 dimethanol, neopentyl glycol, bisphenol A, and bisphenol S, and polyoxyalkylene glycols. A polycarboxylic acid such as trimellitic acid or pyromellitic acid or a polyol such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol may be copolymerized with the polyester, so far as the polyester is substantially linear ordinarily, the amount of the comonomer is up to 1 mole . When a fiber composed of a copolycondensate derived from terephthalic acid, 5 sodium sulfoisophthalic acid, and ethylene glycol or a fiber composed of a polyester in which 0.1 to 5.0 mole of sodium alkylsulfonate or trimethyl phosphate is incorporated is used as the skeleton fiber, the effect of gradually advancing reduction of the strength in the wet state with the lapse of time is enhanced. Sodium alkylsulfonate and trimethyl phosphate may be used alone or in the form of a mixture of both compounds. The configuration of the skeleton fiber used in the present invention is not particularly critical. For example, an unprocessed yarn having a circular or noncircular section may be used. However, it is preferred that a fiber having a configuration modified by false twisting, fluid processing, rubbing processing, stuffing processing, asymmetric structure forming processing, shrinkage difference utilizing processing, or raising processing be used as the skeleton fiber. Moreover, a spun yarn formed by tow spinning, false twist spinning, or composite spinning can be used. These yarns are effective for fixing a covering resin tightly to the surfaces of fibers, and the durability of the applied resin can be increased by the anchoring effect. A resin having a moisture permeability R of at least 2.5 g m2 24 hours is used as the resin to be covered on the skeleton fiber in the present invention.The moisture permeability R referred to herein is a value determined according to the method of JIS 2 0208. Namely, the value of the moisture permeability R is expressed by the amount g of water vapor which passes through a film having a thickness of 0.1 mm and an area of 1 m2 for a period of 24 hours under a relative humidity difference of 90 0 which means that the atmosphere on one side of the film is maintained at a relative humidity of 0 and the atmosphere on the other side of the film is maintained at a relative humidity of 90 . When moisture permeability is lower than 2.5 g mÃª.24 hours, the amount of water vapor passing through the covering resin layer is limited and no substantial wet degradation is attained. If the moisture permeability 2 is very high, for example, 500 to 1000 gum2 24 hours, the degradation rate is too high and the thickness of the covering layer has to be increased, and the resulting fiber has a thick covering layer such that it is of almost no practical use. Among resins having a moisture permeability R of at least 2.5 g m2 .24 hours, a resin having a flexibility but being not water soluble or water swellable is used.For example, there may be used vinyl and vinylidene resins such as polyacrylic acid, polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutene, acetal resins such as a formal resin and polyvinyl butyral, polyamide resins such as nylon 6 and nylon 66, unsaturated polyester resins, polyurethane resins such as other type polyurethane and ester type polyurethane, diene type rubbers such as polybutadiene, styrene butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, polyisobutylene, and butyl rubber, olefin rubbers such as ethylene propylene rubber and polyisobutylether, polysulfide rubbers such as Thiokol rubber, silicone rubbers, fluorine resins such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polytrifluoroethylene, and cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose and othyl cellulose. The thickness of the covering resin layer is appropriately determined according to the desired strength wet reduction ratio of the wet degradable fiber.Ordinarily, the thickness is varied according to the kind of resin, but it is preferred that the thickness of the covering resin layer be 0.05 to 5 mm, more preferably 0.1 to 2 mm. If the thickness of the covering resin layer is smaller than 0.05 mm a uniform covering is hardly formed and the permeability of the covering layer becomes uneven. If the thickness exceeds 5 mm, the contribution of the covering resin layer to the strength becomes excessive, and control of the strength wet reduction ratio becomes difficult. When the skeleton fiber is a polyester fiber, an amine is incorporated in the covering resin. In this case, the resin not only shows a moisture permeability but also exerts a function of fixing the amine to the surface of the fiber, preventing falling of the amine by rubbing or shock and preventing scattering of the amine into air, dissolution of the amine in water, or adhesion of the amine to the finger or skin. By the term amine used herein is meant an aliphatic, aromatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon compound in which an organic group inclusive of hydrogen is substituted with ammonia, a primary amine RNH2 or a secondary amine R2NH . The number of nitrogen atoms contained in one molecule is not particularly critical, and one or more of nitrogen atoms may be contained. It is preferred that an amine which provides a hydrogen ion concentration pH of at least 9.0 when dissolved at a concentration of 5 by weight in water or a solvent having a largest solubility to the amine be used. As specific examples of the amine used in the present invention, there can be mentioned o tolylbiguanide, piperazine anhydride, N methylethanolamine, guanidine carbonate, hexamethylenediamine carbamate, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, N methyl D glucamine,L alginine, 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 ethyl l,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 methyl l propanol,N methyldiethanolamine, 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, polyethylene imine, 2 methylimidazole, 2 ethyl 4 methylimidazole, modified aliphatic polyamines, modified aliphatic polyamine adducts, and ketimine. It is preferred that the content of the amine in the covering resin be 2 to 100 by weight, more preferably 10 to 70 by weight, based on the resin. If the content of the amine is lower than 2 by weight, the hydrolysispromoting action is insufficient. If the content of the amine exceeds 100 by weight, the hydrolysis promoting action is too violent and desirable strength wet reduction cannot be obtained. Any known methods may be adopted for covering the moisture permeable resin on the skeleton fiber. For example, there may be adopted a hot melt extrusion coating method, a method in which the fiber is dipped in a dope of the resin and is squeezed by a mangle, a method in which the fiber is dipped in a dope of the resin and passed through a fine hole, and a method in which the fiber is sprayed with a solution of the resin and is then heated and dried. When an amine is incorporated in the resin, use of the resin in the form of an aqueous liquid such as an aqueous emulsion or an aqueous suspension should be avoided. In order to gradually reduce the strength in the wet state with the lapse of time, the strength wet reduction ratio AS of the wet degradable fiber of the present invention should satisfy requirements represented by the following formulae 0 AS1 AS1 70 , 20 S2 100 , and AS2 ASl 1.10. Supposing that the tensile strength of the wet degradable fiber in the normal state is Sa and the tensile strength of the fiber, measured in the wet state when the fiber is dipped in water at 200C and is taken out after the lapse of a certain time, is SB , the strength wet reduction ratio S is represented as follows SA SB S x 100 SA Incidentally, in the above formulae, AS1 represents the strength wet reduction ratio after 2 hours immersion in water at 200C, and AS2 represents the strength wet reduction ratio after 50 hours immersion in water at 200C. The wet degradable fiber of the present invention can be used for engineering work and ocean engineering work. Especially, the wet degradable fiber of the present invention is preferably used for a diameter expansion type sand bag pack drain for solidifying soft ground, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication Kokai No. 57 143010. Namely, the wet degradable fiber of the present invention is suitable as a fiber manifesting the expansion of diameter required for this diameter expansion type pack drain. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples. These examples by no means limit the scope of the invention.
