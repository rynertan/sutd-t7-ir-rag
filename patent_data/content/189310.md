## Description
The invention relates to N substituted 2 chloro 7 fluoro 10 piperazino 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepins of the general formula I The subject compounds of the invention are highly potent antidopaminergic, non cataleptic neuroleptic agents which are potentially useful for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders of this type. According to recent pharmacological assay results, the compounds are of surprisingly low toxicity and are expected to be substantially free of the common undesirable extrapyramidal side effects lowered motoric coordination and related disturbances . Their acid addition salts, eg hydrochlorides, maleates and especially methanesulphonates, can be used in the formulation of dosage forms for pharmacological evaluation and possible therapeutical application. The basic 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin skeleton of compounds of formula I is a well known carrier system of a number of neuroleptic substances, of which several have found practical use in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, eg, clorotepin 8 chloro 10 methylpiperazino 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin, Metysová J et al, Acta Biol Med Ger A typical and most interesting compound of the present invention has the structure of 3 4 2 chloro 7 fluoro 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin 10 yl piperazino propionamide, which was pharmacologically tested as the methanesulphonate compound A . This compound was tested using oral administration and the numerical data given were calculated per base. Acute toxicity was evaluated in mice and the result, obtained in 48 h, was considered representative LD₅₀ 336 mg kg in male mice and 316 mg kg in female mice. Longer evaluation of the toxicity test leads to lower LD₅₀ values, which is not the result of toxicity of the compounds, but of a deep central depression of the animals which perish due to insufficient feed and water intake. For comparison the value of acute toxicity of clozapine, ie 8 chloro 11 4 methylpiperazine 5H dibenzo b,e 1,4 diazepine Lindt S et al, Farmaco, Ed Prat A further compound of the invention is 1 2 chloro 7 fluoro 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin 10 yl 4 2 1,3 dioxolan 2 yl ethyl piperazine which also was tested as the methanesulphonate compound B . This compound and the following ones were likewise administered orally and the data were calculated per bases. Acute toxicity in mice, LD₅₀ 350 mg kg. Discoordinating effect in the rota rod test in mice, ED₅₀ 3.5 mg kg. In the dose of 50 mg kg it has no cataleptic effect in rats and in the same dose it only mildly potentiates the cataleptogenic effect of perphenazine. In the same dose there is only a slight indication of antiapomorphine effect in rats. In the dose of 80 mg kg after an interval of 3 h it increases the homovanillic acid level in the rat brain striatum by 504 simultaneously, it lowers the dopamine level by 25 . The invention further includes 1 2 chloro 7 fluoro 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin 10 yl 4 2 1,3 dioxan 2 yl ethyl piperazine, which also was tested as the methanesulphonate compound C . Acute toxicity in mice, LD₅₀ is higher than 500 mg kg on intravenous administration, LD₅₀ 77.6 mg kg. Discoordinating activity in the rota rod test in mice, ED₅₀ 2.86 mg kg. In the dose of 50 mg kg, compound C has no cataleptic effect and only mildly potentiates the cataleptogenic effect of perphenazine in rats. In the same dose it does not reveal any antiapomorphine effect in rats. In the dose of 20 mg kg 3 h interval it increases the homovanillic acid level in the rat striatum by 400 clozapine in the same dose by 200 the dopamine level is not affected. The affinity of compound C to dopamine receptors in striatum on the basis of release of ³H spiperone is approximately the same as with clozapine. Finally, 3 4 2 chloro 7 fluoro 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin 10 yl piperazino propionamidoxime, which is also included in the invention, was tested in the form of the dimaleate compound D . Acute toxicity in mice, LD₅₀ 320 mg kg. In the test of affecting the motility of mice according to Ther, the medium effective dose of compound D was 50 mg kg. In the dose of 80 mg kg 3 h after the administration this compound increases homovanillic acid level in rat striatum by more than 300 the increase is significant already after the dose of 20 mg kg.

Neutralization of the base with maleic acid in ethanol gives the neutral maleate C₂₇H₃₀C1FN₂O₆S after crystallization from ethanol the pure substance melts at 166 168 C The product is slightly soluble in water. Neutralization of another sample of the above base with methanesulphonic acid in ethanol and subsequent addition of ether yields the monomethanesulphonate C₂₄H₃₀C1FN₂O₅S₂,which after crystallization from an ethanol ether mixture melts at 158 159 C.
