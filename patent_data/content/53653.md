# A voltage temperature insensitive on chip reference voltage source compatible with VLSI manufacturing techniques.

## Abstract
A voltage and temperature insensitive reference circuit voltage source for predetermining the proportion of supply voltage to constitute the output voltage including a pull up device and a pull down device connected between a source of supply voltage and a reference point. A two element biasing circuit is connected between the source and the pull down device which is connected to the reference point with the pull up device comprising a FET having a gate. A connection extends from the biasing circuit at a point between its elements to the gate. An output connection extends from the junction of the pull up and pull down device. One of the elements which is connected between the source and the other of the elements is characterized by high resistance relative to the other of the elements whereby the proportion of voltage available at the output connection remains substantially constant regardless of source voltage variation and ambient temperature.
