# Electronic fluorescent lamp ballast.

## Abstract
An electronic ballast inverter for multiple fluorescent lamps 10, 12 employs a push pull inverter and a series resonant circuit for driving the lamps. The inverter operates at the resonant frequency of the series resonant circuit. The current in the resonant circuit is limited, for low load condi tions, in response to a sensing voltage which is used to raise the frequency of operation of the inverter to make the load more reactive.
