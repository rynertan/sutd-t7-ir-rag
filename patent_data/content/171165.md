# Coupling clutch and a self contained, non removable guard.

## Abstract
A clutch according to the present invention includes first and second hubs 48, 148 having first and second splined fric tion discs 68, 168 received thereon. The first friction disc 68 is biased away from the second friction disc 168 and is movable towards the second friction disc 168 preferably by a piston 90 reciprocally mounted in a housing 12 and rotat ably mounted on the friction disc by a bearing 102 . The sec ond friction disc 168 is substantially prevented from sliding on the splines with the second hub 148 , the splines 158, 176 allowing the second friction disc 168 to cant to compen sate for axial angular misalignment of the first and second hubs 48, 148 . The guard 120 according to the invention includes a plurality of ring members 122 held in a spaced realtion by bars 124 . The bars 124 are received within apertures 26 formed in the first shell 14 and are captured therein when the second shell 12 is secured thereto. The guard 120 cannot be removed without disassembly of the housing.
