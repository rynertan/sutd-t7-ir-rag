# Positive displacement screw pump.

## Abstract
A screw displacement pump 10 for comingled material has a body 11 defining a chamber 12 . Inlets are provided for the admission of fluid to the chamber and an outlet is provided for discharge of fluid from the chamber 12 intermeshing screw members 40 are mounted for rotation within the chamber 12 for transporting comingled material from the inlet to the outlet, the threads 41,42 of the intermeshing screw members 40 being of opposite hand The pitch of the screws 40 at the outlet end thereof is smaller than the pitch of the screws 40 at the inlet end thereof to cause compression of gaseous material being transported. Clearance is provided between the screws 40 and between the screws 40 and the walls of the chamber 12 to allow sufficient leakage of the material towards the inlet, when the material is in the liquid phase, to avoid a liquid lock.
