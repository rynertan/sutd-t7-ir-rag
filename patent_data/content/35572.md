# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INSPECTING SEALED PACKAGES FOR PINHOLES.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for inspecting for pinholes in a sealed and packaged body in vacuum, which body accom modates a volatile substance such as glucose injection solu tion, distilled water for injection, milk, oil or the like, and a sublimated substance such as naphthalene or the like. These will be referred to as volatile substances hereafter. In accordance with the invention, the judgement as to whether or not pinholes are present is performed accurately by first eliminating any outside influence attributed to a volatile sub stance either attaching to the outside of the packaged body or remaining within the inspection chamber. This is accomp lished by vaporizing the volatile substance in advance using a vaporization evacuation unit provided in the inspecting chamber, the vaporized substance being cooled and retrieved by a cooling heat exchanger.
