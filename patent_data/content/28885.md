# An electrically conducting cermet, its production and use.

## Abstract
An electrically conducting cermet comprises a sintered compact of refractory oxide granules such as alumina granules having diameters of from 50 to 800 microns and a conductive network extending through the cermet and pro vided by a layer of one or more of titanium, zirconium, haf nium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molyb denum, tungsten, iron cobalt or nickel surrounding the indi vidual oxide granules and constituting a volume fraction of 0.04 to 0.2 of the total cermet, wherein particles of one or more of said metals are dispersed within the oxide granules in a volume fraction of 0.01 to 0.15 of the granules, which granules also contain 0.01 to 0.25 per cent by weight of magnesium oxide.
