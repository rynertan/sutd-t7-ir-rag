# Paper folding apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for forming a longitudinal fold in a web of paper includes a paper feed arrangement 10 , paper folding means 12 , arranged below and downstream of the paper feed arrangement 10 , and guide means 14 extending between the paper feed arrangement and the paper folding means. The paper feed arrangement 10 includes an input 16 roller 22 and a support 24 on which are mounted a pair of tractor drives 26 engageable with the edges of the web. The support 24 is movable in a transverse direction to alter the position of the web relative to the paper folding means. The paper folding means 12 includes a pair of fold plates 32 mounted upstream of a pair of driven output rollers 34 which are resiliently biased into engagement with one another. The gap between the fold plates 32 extends perpendicularly to the input roller 22 . The guide medns 14 is a rigid V shaped member extending from lust below the input roller 22 to just above the fold plates 32 . The apparatus may be used to form a fold in single or multi sheet webs without prior perforation or scoring along the fold line. It may also form a fold at any of a range of transverse positions across the web.
