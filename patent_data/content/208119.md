Such industries include the oil production industry where waters from the oil fie ls contain undesirable oil dispersed therein, and in this instance undesirable solids. Other examples are the pulping and paper producing industries, the metal and automotive industries. New materials having activity in emulsion breaking, or emulsion resolution, applications anl processes are highly desired and sought. Not only are active materials of greater efficiencies than those presently available desirable, but also active materials of different chemical compositions in and of themselves, to augment the available selection of materials and widen the choices for any qiven need.

Emulsicn breaking, the resolution of an emulsion, such as an oil in water emulsion, into seDarate continuous oil and water phases, is an important industrial application, often associated with the treatment of industrial waters containing such emulsion as an undesirable contaminant. The automotive industry commonly uses paint emulsions.In refineries and steel mills waters containing emulsified oil are often formed. Oil field produced waters can contain both dispersed oil and solids. Polymers of the quaternary ammonium salts of l acryloyl 4 methyl piperazine, including the homopolymer thereof and polymers derived from the polymeriation of the quaternary ammonium saittoqetherwith other suitable vinyl addition monomers, have been found extremely active in emulsion breakinq applications, as shown below in Examples 13 to 17. EXAMPLES 13 TO 17 A number of the polymers prepared in preceding examples demonstrated oil in water emulsion breaking activities at low dosages based on active polymer in in a series of comparative tests, as follows. The polymer was added to an oil in water emulsion which was the agitated for a 6 minute period. Then 150 opm alum was added and agitation, at a lower speed, was continued for 3 minutes, followed by the addition of 2 ppm of a commercial anionic flocculant with a further lower speed of agitation continued for 1 minute.Effectiveness was determined by the turbidity of the test mixture after it had been allowed to settle for 30 minutes after agitation ceased. Examples 13 to 17 continued Set out in Table I below are the dosage ranges at which such polymers were found effective as emulsion breakers in this test. These dosage ranges are at least on the same level with, and in soe instances lower than, that of materials presently in commercial use in emulsion breaking applications.

EXAMPLE 18 In the following Bench Wemco CoagulationTest, materials were tested at various concentrations for one minute at 170 rnm in a small Wemco unit for clarification of oil field type waters containing dispersed solids and oil. The test samples were allowed to sit for 10 seconds after the one minute agitation period and then the percent li qht transmittance therethrough was measured on a photometer. A conolymer of l acryloyl 4 methyl piperazine and acrylamide, whose preparation is described above in Example 12, havinq about 30 mole percent of the piperazine and 70 mole percent of the acrylamide, was tested and found to be of superior activity at various typical dosaqe levels when compared to, commercial products for such applications. Such commercial products were of the high molecular weight dlmethylaminoethylmethacrlate dimethyl sulfate quaternary ammonium salt and acrylamide copolymer type.
