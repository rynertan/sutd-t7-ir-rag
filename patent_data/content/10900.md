# A static inverter with a relatively low frequency output voltage, and a method for generating this voltage.

## Abstract
In a static inverter for providing a low frequency out put e.g. 60Hz from a d.c. supply Q , the passage of low frequency currents through the inverter transformer P is avoided by producing a train of high frequency pulses e.g. 40kHz which represent, for example by their pulse widths 4 , the successive instantaneous amplitudes of the requi red low frequency voltage. These pulses cause a train of corresponding pulses 7 to be produced at the secondary of the transformer, and this train is filtered H to produce a unidirectional voltage 9 having the desired instantane ous amplitudes. This voltage is fed to a transistor switching bridge 1 which changes the unidirectional voltage into an alternating voltage 12 having the required low frequency. Means N, E, L, M is preferably provided to allow regene ration of power from the load back into the d.c. supply Q .
