# Gear pump or motor.

## Abstract
A fluid gear pump or motor 10 has a central housing 12 with an end cover 16 on one side and an adapter cover 20 on the other. A pair of gears 30, 32 are rotat able inside the housing 12 and one gear shaft 30 extends through the adapter cover 20 for attachment to another machine. The adapter cover 20 is mechanically grounded to the attached machine. Internal loads on the gear shafts 31,33 are transmitted to bearings 34, 35, 36, 37 mounted in the two covers 16, 20 . A centering plate 40 transmits the loads from one pair of bearings 35, 37 in the end cover 16 to the housing 12 . Another center ing plate 40 transmits the loads from the housing 12 and the other bearings 34, 36 to the grounded adapter cover 20 . Free floating wear plates 60, 60 are provided in intimate contact with the end faces of the meshed gears 30, 32 , and a balancing assembly 50, 50 is provided between each wear plate 60, 60 and the respective adjacent centering plate 40, 40 . The belancing assem blies 50,50 are formed to define areas adjacent to but sealed off from the pump inlet that are subjected to outlet pressure in order to balance the loading of the gears 30, 32 .
