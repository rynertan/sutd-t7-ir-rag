## Description
The present invention relates to a fenderfairing structure,particularly effective for tractor semitrailers. As it is well known,tractor semitrailers comprise a tractor thereto there is coupled, by means of an articulating fifth wheel, the semitrailer which latter may be detached from the tractor as it is required. In order to facilitate the latching and unlatching operations of the semitrailer to from the tractor, the rear wheel fender is open at the top and,more specifically, it consists of a front portion and a rear portion which are respectively located at the front and rear of the wheel, thereby the upper part of the latter is substantially free. As the tractor semitrailer is driven with the semitrailer coupled to the tractor, the semitrailer itself practically acts as a fender for the rear wheel, since it is located at a reduced spacing above said rear wheel. On the other hand,a problem is originated as the tractor is driven without the semitrailer. Infact,in that casethe rear wheel remains unprotected since any suitable fender structure is available. Due to that reason, and especially in the rain, great amount of water are upwardly pro√Öaect ed by the rear wheels of the tractor, thereby reducing the visibility field of the following vehicles, with consequent overtaking difficulties by the latter. Another drawback is moreover that, under the mentioned conditions, great amounts of mud are projected on the articulating fifth wheel, which has to be accurately cleaned before coupling the semitrailer to the tractor. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks,by providing such a fairing fender structure which is specifically designed for protecting the rear wheels of a tractor and the like, and which affords the possibility of being easily removed, as the semitrailer is coupled thereto,and engaged as the tractor is to be driven without the semitrailer. Within that task, it is a main object of the present invention to provide such a fairingfender structure which while affording the possibility of being mounted quickly and simply, is so designed as to provide a suitable and reliable protection, thereby preventing water and mud from being upwardly projected as the tractor is driven with the semitrailer disengaged. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a fairing fender structure which is of very reduced size, thereby, in the nonuse condition it is not necessary to remove or store parts of said structure. Yet another object of the present invention is that of providing such a fairing fender structure which is highly competitive from a mere economical standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task and objects,as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter,are achieved by a fairing fender structure, particularly for tractors of tractor semitrailers,characterized in that it comprises a flexible plate like element effective to be arranged above each rear wheel of said tractor, said plate like member being effective to be wound from a winder device as supported at the upper end of the rear wheel fender front portion and being effective to be engaged with the upper end of the rear portion of said fender and vice versa. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more apparent hereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrated, by way of an indicative but not limitative example, in the accompanying drawings, where fig.l schematically illustrates the tractor of a tractor semitrailer with the fairing fender structure removed from the rear wheel of the tractor fig.2 schematically illustrates the tractor of a tractor semitrailer with the fairing fender structure applied to the rear wheelgand fig.3 schematically illustrates the winder device associated with the plate like element forming said fairing fender structure. With reference to the figures of the accompanying drawings, the fairing fender structure for tractors of tractor semitrailers according to the present invention, comprises a plate like element l,made from a flexible or resilient material,and having a suitable strength and thickness in such a way as to be able of resisting, without any damages, against projection of solid bodies and rocks. Ehe mentioned plate like element 1 may be unwound from a winder device 2,which latter is preferably of the automatic rewinding type thus, on the unwound plate like element will act in any case a resilient return force which is effective to maintain it in a stretched condition above the wheel, at the region included between the front portion 3 of the fender of the rear wheel 4 and the rear portion thereof, indicated at 5. More specifically, the winder device 2 is provided, at the two ends whereof, with ears 6 for fixing said device at the upper or top end of the fender front portion 3. At its end projecting from said winder device 2, the resilient plate like member 2 is provided with a rigid cross bar 7,to facilitate the engaging and driving of said resilient plate like element. Moreover, at one end thereof, the plate like element 1 is provided with a window pair 8, provided for engaging with hook members 9 as formed at the upper end of the fender rear portion 5. The fairing fender structure according to the present invention may be used in a very simple way, which will be clear from the above disclosure. More specifically, as the tractor is to be used without the semitrailer, the user has to simply withdraw,by means of the cross bar 7,the resilient plate like element 1 from the winder device 2,in such a way as to engage the windows 8 with the hook members 9 thus the plate like element 1 will be arranged, in a stretched condition, above the rear wheel 4, thereby acting as an efficient shield against projection of water, solid materials and the like. As the semitrailers is to be coupled to the tractor, the user will disengage the windows 8 from the hook members 9 thus the mentioned plate like element 1 will be automatically rewind by the winder 2,thereby the semitrailer may be easily coupled to the tractor. The above also applies in the case therein the winder device 2 is coupled to the fender rear portion and the hook members are provided at the front portion thereof. From the above disclosure it should be noted that the invention fully achieves the intended objects. In particular it should be noted that the provision of a flexible or resilient plate like member,having a suitable thickness and which may be automatically rew wai by the winder device, affords the possibility of making a fairingfender structure for a tractor rear wheels which is effectively a practical one and which does not obstruct in any ways the semitrailer coupling and disengaging operations. Moreover the very reduced size of the winder and its quick coupling to the fender afford the possibility of applying it to any types of tractor semitrailer. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to several modifications and variations, all whereof fall within the scope of the inventive idea. Moreover all of the details may be replaced by technically equivalent elements.
