# Colour cathode ray tube apparatus.

## Abstract
Information about the position of an electron beam in a shadow mask colour cathode ray tube is obtained by detecting a signal representative of the electron beam current intercepted by the shadow mask. The signal may be derived by detecting the current generated by the electron beam in the shadow mask, or in the conductive layer at the tube screen, or by detecting the difference between the electron beam currents in the mask and at the screen. In the latter case, the shadow mask 2 and the conductive layer 3 are connected respectively to the ends of the primary winding 6 of a transformer. The difference currents are detected by a secondary winding 9. A centre tap 8 of the primary winding is connected to the tube EHT. EHT isolation may also be achieved by optical or capacitive decoupling. The shadow mask may have shaped apertures to generate distinctive difference currents. In a preferred embodiment the apertures are slits or rows of slots extending from one side to the other of the shadow mask and a line raster is such that each line coincides with a different slit.

## Description
COLOUR CATHODE RAY TUBE APPARATUS This invention relates to colour cathode ray tube apparatus of the shadow mask type. Although colour cathode ray tube technology is advancing at an extraordinary rate, the application setting the standards for technology is domestic television. In this application the screen is intended to be viewed at a distance of two or three metres and the tolerance of the viewer to marginal picture distortion and colour convergence and purity inaccuracies is, with minor exceptions, high. Much higher standards are required if a colour cathode ray tube is to be used in a display terminal for the display of alphanumeric and graphical data. The user is only about one half metre from the tube and the requirement may be to display over 3,000 clearly distinguishable characters. This postulates extremely precise control of the electron beams of the cathode ray tube. Control of the position of an electron beam using feedback is known in electron microscopes and in beam indexing cathode ray tubes. Electron microscope technology is so different from that of the cathode ray tube as to provide little assistance to the latter. Beam indexing tubes rely on detecting the position of an electron beam at the screen of the tube. Typical such systems are described in BritishPatent Specifications 1,403,061, 1,195,588 and 1,006,697. The first two Specifications describe various means of deriving information from the screen such as by secondary emission or currents generated in conductors by the electron beam.Specification 1,006,697 describes beam position detection by noting the instants at which the beam touches a conductor arranged in serpentine fashion and positioned a short distance from the screen. All beam indexing systems rely on electron beams selectively activating phosphors arranged in vertical strips on the tube screen. As the required resolution of the picture increases, so the widths of the phosphor strips decrease and so must the size of the electron beam. At the resolution required of data display terminals, even were the electron beam size to be achieved, the picture brightness would be below acceptable standards. Application of some of the techniques used in beam indexing tubes to a shadow mask tube is possible, but all require costly adaptation of the tube. It is the object of the invention to obtain feedback signals from which beam positional information can be derived without the necessity for complex modification of the shadowmask tube. According to the invention, colour cathode ray tube apparatus including a shadow mask colour cathode ray tube is characterised by means to derive a signal representative of the electron beam current intercepted by the shadow mask. The signal may be representative of currents generated by the electron beam in the shadow mask or in the conductive layer at the tube screen, but preferably the said means to derive a signal comprises means to detect the differences in currents generated by an electron beam at the shadow mask and at the screen. In the shadow mask tube, the screen is maintained at the same high potential as at the shadow mask by means of a thin conductive layer of aluminium. According to the difference current embodiment of the invention the ends of the primary winding of a transformer are connected respectively to the shadow mask and the conductive layer. A centre tap of the primary winding is connected to the source of high potential.A secondary winding of the transformer, one end of which is connected to ground potential, detects the difference in the currents generated in the shadow mask and at the screen by an electron beam. The invention is further explained, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic of cathode ray tube apparatus indicating how difference currents are obtained in the preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 2 illustrates how different currents are generated in the shadow mask and at the screen of a cathode ray tube as the position of an electron beam changes Figure 3 shows a modified shadow mask which generates distinctive difference currents in accordance with the vertical position of an electron beam Figure 4 is a waveform of difference currents derived from the shadow mask of Figure 3 Figures 5, 6 and 7 illustrate one use of a shadow mask according to Figure 3 Figure 8 shows another design of shadow mask particularly suitable for generating difference currents Figure 9 is a block diagram of colour shadow mask cathode ray tube apparatus using the mask of Figure 8 Figures 10 to 13 are graphs showing difference currents and other signals generated in the system of Figure 9 and Figure 14 illustrates convergence correction apparatus using beam position error signals generated by the system ofFigure 9. Figures 15 and 16 illustrate different means for deriving a signal representative of the electron beam current intercepted by the shadow mask. Operation of the invention depends on the fact that in different positions of an electron beam relative to the apertures in a shadow mask, different values of current are intercepted by the shadow mask. The value of the intercepted current can be detected by detecting the current in the shadow mask, or by detecting the current in the conductive layer at the screen, i.e., by detecting the beam passing through the apertures in the shadow mask, which is, of course, a measure of the beam current intercepted by the shadow mask, or by detecting the difference between the currents generated by the beam in the shadow mask and at the screen. The detection of difference currents has the advantage of doubling the rate of change of the signal as the beam moves across the shadow mask.If E is the beam current and A is the proportion of E intercepted by the shadow mask, the three methods detect respectively E.A, E 1 A , and E A 1 A E 2A 1 . Referring to Figure 1, in the embodiment of the invention in which difference currents are detected a colour cathode ray tube 1 has a shadow mask 2 and a conductive layer 3 at the screen, provided for the purpose of maintaining the screen at high potential, usually the potential of the final anode of the electron guns not shown . Conductors 4, 5 are connected between, respectively, the shadow mask 2 and the conductive layer 3 and the ends of the primary winding 6 of a transformer. A centre tap 7 of winding 6 is connected to a terminal 8 at which the high potential is available. A secondary winding 9 of the transformer is connected between ground and a terminal 10. At terminal 10, a current appears which represents the difference between the currents generated by an electron beam in the shadow mask 2 and the conductive layer 3.It will be noted that a direct current signal is not obtained. As an electron beam traces a raster over the shadow mask, varying fractions of the beam are intercepted by the shadow mask and generate currents therein. The remainder of the beam passes through the apertures in the shadow mask, lands on the conductive layer and generates currents in the layer. The relative sizes of the currents in the shadow mask and the conductive layer, and thus the difference between the currents, indicates the fraction of the beam intercepted by the shadow mask. Figure 2 is illustrative and shows a crosssection of part of the shadow mask 2 with apertures 11 and the conductive layer 3. An electron beam 12 is shown in two positions, its boundaries in the two positions beiny indicated by continuous and by dotted lines respectively. For simplicity, we restrict the discussion to the two dimensional case. The difference between the currents in the shadow mask 2 in the two position of the beam is positive and proportional to b a . The difference in the currents in the conductive layer 3 is negative and proportional to c b a . The difference in the currents detected at terminal 10 Figure 1 is b a c 2 b a . While the argument is rather simplistic, it does not, for example, take account of the electron density across the beam, it does show that in different positions of the beam different currents will be generated in the shadow mask 2 and the conductive layer 3. Figure 3 illustrates one embodiment of the invention, showing in part a shadow mask 2 with the conventional arrangement of holes 13. At the edges of the shadow mask are formed apertures 14 of such shape and relative disposition as to provide distinctive signals. As shown in Figure 3 the apertures 14 are slots, angled to provide an inverted V pattern. If an electron beam is caused to trace a horizontal line raster over the shadow mask depicted in Figure 3 the difference currents generated by a pair of adjacent apertures 14 will have the distinct form shown in Figure 4. The difference current is at a maximum when no part of electron beam is striking the screen and declines to a minimum as the beam crosses an aperture 14.The time interval between the minima caused by the beam crossing two adjacent apertures 14 is representative of the vertical position of the beam in that segment of the screen containing the apertures. Figure 4 also shows the shape of the signal generated by the shadow mask current alone, and is the inverse of the signal generated by the screen current alone. In all three cases the signals are distinctive. We describe the use of apertures 14 in terms of difference currents but screen or mask currents can equally well be detected. Referring to Figure 5, a single pair of apertures 14 is shown together with some lines 15 of a horizontal line raster. The apertures 14 define a notional point P on the shadow mask and it is possible, from the difference currents generated by the raster lines 15 crossing apertures 14, to determine the position of the raster relative to P. From this information the position of the raster relative to the shadow mask can be adjusted. Referring to Figure 6, terminal 10 Figure 1 is connected to a pulse peak detector 16, the output of which is connected as input to a bistable circuit 17 such that each input pulse received by the bistable circuit 17 changes the stable state of the circuit. An output 18 of circuit 17 which is active when circuit 17 is in the stable state representative of an onus condition is connected as one input to an and circuit 19.The other input of and gate 19 is connected to a suitable oscillator, for example the cathode ray tube clock oscillator, and the output of and gate 19 is connected to a counter 20. Counter 20 counts the pulses generated by the oscillator connected to and gate 19 for the period during which and gate 19 is open due to bistable circuit 18 being on . Bistable circuit 18 is on in the interval between detection of the peaks of the pulses generated by an electron beam crossing apertures 14. The count is thus representative of the time interval between detection of the pulses. The counter 20 is reset, after a suitable interval, by the off output 21 of bistable circuit 17, which is connected to counter 20 through a delay device 22. The line flyback pulse may be supplied to a reset terminal of bistable circuitry 17, to ensure it is in the offs state at the beginning of a line.The counts are stored in a digital store 23 at positions representative of the raster lines. This may be achieved by supplying to the addressing circuitry 24 of the store 23 the value of the current line count. All data terminals have a line counter from which this value may be taken. Referring to Figure 5, the values t1 to t2 and t3 for the respective raster lines N, N 1 and N 2 are held in store 23. The values may be used in one of two ways. Store 23 can hold ideal values of t1, t2 and t3, which are the values these time intervals should have if the raster were correctly positioned on the shadow mask. By subtracting the derived values of t1, t2 and t3 respectively from the ideal values the actual positon relative to the ideal position of the raster can be determined.If, for example, the derived t1 were greater than the ideal t1 the raster is positioned too low and a small additional current may be supplied to the frame timebase signal to reposition the first line of the raster higher on the shadow mask. If, on the other hand, the derived value of t1 were less than the ideal value the raster would be too high relative to the ideal position and less frame timebase current is supplied to position the first line of the raster lower on the shadow mask. While it is only necessary to perform the subtraction for one raster line, it is preferred to do it for three to allow for inaccuracies in determining the values of the intervals t. The use of three lines permits a majority vote to be taken.The subtractions may be executed in a purpose built comparator but it is preferred that the store 23 should form part of a microprocessor associated with the cathode ray tube. The positional information may also be used in a colour cathode ray tube to correct convergence by applying increments of current to the convergence coils. An alternative method of deriving positional information from the values t1, t2 and 3 is illustrated in Figure 7 where PQ represents a line through the centre of right hand aperture 14 of Figure 5 and PR is the perpendicular from P Fig. 5 to the raster lines N, N 1 and N 2. The distancePS from P to raster line N 1 is calculated and compared with an ideal value. We take the unit of length to be the distance between the two raster lines. t2 2.PS. tan QPR i But tan QPR t2 t1 2 t3 t2 2 t3 t1 4 To allow for errors in determining tl, t2 and t3, all three values are calculated and averaged. The result is substituted in i and the value of PS obtained. It will be noted that the divisors 2 cancel so that for greater accuracy the full values t1, t2 and t3 may be used instead of the half values. After comparison with the ideal value, the frame timebase is adjusted to reposition the raster. The procedure can be repeated for each electron beam of a colour cathode ray tube thereby ensuring vertical convergence.Other patterns of aperture which give distinctive current signals can be used. In a further embodiment of the invention, herein described with reference to Figures 8 to 14, and the subject of our copending British application 7922387, from which the following description is taken, the shadow mask is provided with slits which extend from one side to the other of the display area. The electron beam, or beams in the case of a multigun colour cathode ray tube, are caused to trace a line raster of which each line is collinear with a respective one of the slits. Referring to Figure 8, the shadow mask 2 used in this embodiment is of conventional construction, differing from known masks only in the number of apertures and the relative orientation of the apertures and the raster scan. The apertures are in the form of straight slits 25, and rows of slots 25 , extending at least from one edge to the opposite edge of the region in which a display is generated. For convenience, the apertures will be referred to as slits, which term comprehends both the slits 25 and the rows of slots 25 . The shadow mask 2 is used in a colour multi gun cathode ray tube of which the beams are caused to trace a line raster, which may be interlaced. There is one line of the raster to each slit 25 and the lines of the raster are caused to coincide with the slits 25 i.e. the raster lines are collinear with the slits 25.Although in practice it is found most convenient to provide a horizontal line raster, in which case the shadow mask 2 is as shown in Figure 8, the invention can also be applied to a vertical line raster, in which case the slits 25 are disposed vertically. With a horizontal line raster, the electron guns of a cathode ray tube should be arranged so as to subtend different vertical angles to the slits 25. While it is preferred to have the guns arranged in line perpendicular to the slits 25, it is also possible to have a delta gun arrangement with one side of the triangle of which the guns are the apices perpendicular to the slits. By way of example, there may be 512 horizontal slits each .13 mm wide and with centres spaced at a distance of .39 mm.In conjunction with phosphor stripes .092 mm wide, this provides clipping and leaving tolerances of .019 mm for the maintenance of colour purity. As is usual practice, the inner walls of the slits are tapered to a point to prevent beam electrons, scattered by impact with the side walls, activating screen phosphors to generate unwanted colours. This may be done by etching the slits from only one side of the mask so that the beam exit aperture is wider than the entrance aperture. Figure 9 shows the system whereby positional information is derived using the shadow mask 2 of Figure 8. Referring toFigure 8, in which the circles 33 to 36 represent different positions of an electron beam, it will be seen that the difference current is at a minimum when the beam is symmetric to the slit 2 and increases with the asymmetry of the beam relative to the slit. To detect the difference currents the arrangement of Figure 1 is used. It will be noted that the centre tap 7 is connected to the final anodes 26 of the electron guns. The potential of point 8 may be, for example 20kV. The means for detecting difference currents does not interfere with the usual arrangement for generating the electron beams and directing them at the screen.The secondary coil 9 of the transformer is connected at one end to earth and at the other to three channels 27 to 29 in which error signals for the control of the red, green and blue electron beams are derived from the difference current signal appearing in secondary coil 9. The control problem is complicated by the fact that three electron beams are simultaneously directed at the screen. Further, each beam is modulated by a video signal. The beams can be distinguished by time division multiplexing but it is preferred to use frequency division multiplexing. The ambiguity in the sign of the tracking error is removed by imposing on each beam a spot wobble or dither.This produces an error signal which is clearly recognisable and readily useable. Referring to Figure 9, the cathode ray tube 1 has vertical deflection coils 30 which are supplied with a vertical deflection current by driver circuitry 31. An oscillator 32 supplies to the driver circuitry 31 a sinusoidal frequency FD which is superimposed on the conventional vertical deflection waveform. The effect is to oscillate each beam as shown in part in Figure 8 where the references 33 to 36 illustrate landing positions during one halfwave of the oscillation, assuming the beam to be correctly tracking the slit 2. The amplitude of the oscillation is chosen such that the oscillation causes about a 5 variation in the currents generated in the shadow mask and at the screen.The variation in image brightness due to the oscillation will be less than this in a tube having negative purity margin phosphor stripe width smaller than electron spot . This is because in such a tube the width of a phosphor stripe is less than the slit width by twice the leaving tolerance. Consequently the phosphor will only be struck by electrons from near the centre of the Gaussian intensity curve, where the slope of the curve is relatively gradual. In cathode ray tube apparatus designed to be operated as a data terminal the video information is supplied in discrete form at a rate known as the pel frequency. In order to prevent beating between the dither and the video modulation, FD is synchronised with, or preferably is derived from the same source as the pel frequency generator.Thus, the element shown as 32 in Figure 9 can be the oscillator from which the basic timing of the apparatus is derived and the frequency FD merely one output of this oscillator. The dither signal FD moves the electron beams relative to the shadow mask apertures and thus modulates the currents at FD, 2FD and higher harmonics. On the assumption that the electron beams have an intensity distribution which is approximately Gaussian, only the fundamental and second harmonic are significant. Figures 10 to 13 are plots of amplitude against time of the fundamental and second harmonic of the difference current detected at coil 9. The graphs also illustrate the displacement of an electron beam relative to a slit. Curve 37 of Figure 10 represents the position of a beam which is coincident with the slit apart from the movement imposed by the dither signal.In this case the AC component of the difference current waveform 38 contains no fundamental and is almost entirely composed of the second harmonic of the dither frequency. The case in which the beam is slightly misaligned with the slit in the positive direction is shown inFigure 11. Curve 37 starts at some positive value on the vertical axis. The AC component of the difference current waveform 38 is now asymmetrical, but it is significant that there is now a detectable fundamental 39 of given phase and amplitude. The second harmonic 40 is also shown. Figures 12 and 13 show situations in which the beam is differently misaligned with the slit. In Figure 12 the misalignment is twice as far in the same direction as in Figure 11 and in Figure 13 the misalignment is half as far as, and in the opposite direction to that in Figure 11.Comparing the fundamental curves 39 in Figures 11 to 13, it is seen that the fundamental indicates in phase the direction, and in amplitude, the amplitude of the misalignment of the beam with the slit. Extraction of the fundamental thus provides a signal which can be used directly to correct the alignment of the beam with the slit. Referring to Figure 9, the beams are differentiated by frequency modulation. The red, green and blue guns, 41 to 43, respectively, receive video information at terminals 44 to 46, respectively. For simplicity, we describe only the processing of the red video signal. The red video signal at terminal 44 is filtered in low pass filter 47 of which the cut off frequency is chosen to be smallest value which will not degrade the video signal appreciably. If the video pel frequency is 20MHz, the cut off may be chosen as 40MHz. The filter 47 may be integrated into the video amplifer design.The filtered red video is then added in summing network 48 to a carrier signal a 1 sin2 FRt from an oscillator 49. FR, and the corresponding signals in the other video channels, FG and FB, are chosen above the cut off frequency of the low pass filter 47 the filters in each channel are identical and sufficiently different so as to avoid side band overlap after amplitude modulation by the dither signal. The three frequencies should also be non harmonically related to avoid mutual interference due to non linear distortion. For exampleFR 60MHz, FG 70MHz and F B 80MHz. A suitable dither frequency FD is 2MHz. It will be noted that the presence of the carrier signal in the red video modulating signal means that the beam is never completely extinguished.The factor a should be chosen sufficiently large to give a useable signal but not so large as to reduce contrast significantly. A suitable value for a is 5 of the maximum video signal. Gamma correction of the output of summing network 48 may be required to linearize the I V characteristic of the cathode ray tube. The difference currents detected in coil 9 are supplied to the red, green and blue error signal channels 27 to 29 respectively. The red channel 27 includes a demodulator 50 which mixes the signal from coil 9 with the carrier frequency 2 FRt. Ideally, this demodulator performs the analogue multiplication of its inputs. A second demodulator 51 mixes the output of demodulator 50 with the dither frequency, sin2 FDt. An adjustable delay 51 is provided for synchronisation. Finally, a low pass filter 52 with a cut off somewhat less than F D produces at its output the error signalER due to the red beam. In similar fashion, error signalsEG and EB due to the green and blue beams, respectively, are produced at the outputs of the green and blue error signal channels 28 and 29 respectively. Figure 14 illustrates one way in which the error signals ER, EG and EB can be used. The figure shows a crosssection of the neck of the cathode ray tube with the electron beams R, G and B emanating from in line guns arranged perpendicularly of the slits. Surrounding the neck of the tube is a known convergence correction device consisting of two threepoled armatures 53, 54 with centre poles 55, 56 on the line of the electron beams. The outer poles are wound with seriesconnected coils 57, 58 and 59, 60, respectively, which receive signals to correct the vertical component of misconvergence of the blue and red electron beams relative to the green beam.The coils 61, 62 wound on the centre poles correct the horizontal component of misconvergence by adjusting the horizontal position of the red and blue beams relative to the green beam. Any of the standard techniques can be used to calculate or derive the appropriate signals for the coils 61, 62. The correction of horizontal misconvergence forms no part of this invention. The arrangement of Figure 14 has the advantage that the outer beams are separately controllable armature 54 controls the blue beam and armature 53 controls the red beam. A signal EB EG can be applied directly to the coils 57, 58 while a signal ER EG can be applied directly to the coils 59, 60. The signal EG is supplied directly to the vertical deflection coils 30 Figure 9 .The effect of EG is to adjust the vertical position of all three beams until the green beam is aligned with the slit. The signals ER EG and EB EG adjust the vertical positions of, respectively, the red and the blue beams. The signalsEB EG and ERE G are derived by subtracting the signalEG from the signals EB and ER, respectively, using conventional subtracting networks. In order to prevent the different beams locking on different slits, two modifications of the system described with reference to Figures 9 to 14 may be found desirable. To ensure that the beams start together in the top slit, initial correction currents EB EG, ER EG and EG should be supplied B E E G to the coils 57 and 58, 59 and 60, and 30, respectively, at the beginning of each frame scan which position the beams at the left hand end of the top slit. The initial currents may be derived from adjustable resistors connected to a suitable potential source. To ensure that the beams all track the correct stir after line flyback, the first correction signals applied to each line, before feedback information is available, are those applied to the preceding line.The signals EB, EG and ER are sampled a short interval after the start of a line in conventional sample and hold circuits and the sample values are supplied to the correction coils at the conclusion of the line blanking signal, which is on during the line flyback period. The remaining elements of cathode ray tube apparatus according to the invention are conventional. It is preferred that the vertical deflection be effected by means of a staircase signal instead of the more usual ramp signal. The staircase signal can be generated by means of any of the commonly available integrated digital to analogue converters to which the input is provided by a counter driven by a suitable oscillator. Although reference has been made to deflection coils, thereby implying that the description relates only to electromagnetic deflection systems, it is to be understood that the invention is applicable also to electrostatic or mixed electromagnetic electrostatic systems. The term deflection coils is intended to comprehend the deflection means used in any of the conventional deflection systems. Arrangements for detecting directly the beam currents intercepted by the shadow mask are shown in Figures 15 and 16. The embodiment of Figure 15 uses an optical coupling to perform the high voltage isolation function of the transformer of the embodiment of Figure 1. The high potential EHT terminal 8 is connected directly, through conductor 5, to the conductive layer 3 at the screen of the cathode ray tube 1, and is connected through a light emitting diode LED 63 and conductor 4 to the shadow mask. A bias resistor 64 may be provided if the characteristics of LED 63 make it desirable.A radiation detecting element 65 is connected between ground and terminal 10 at which a signal representative of the mask current appears. LED 63 may be GaAs, in which case the radiation emitted is largely in the infra red band. A suitable LED is a TIES 36 made by Texas Instruments.In this case element 65 is preferably of silicon and may be a silicon phototransistor. It is thought, however that the response of a phototransistor would be too slow for some applications and it is preferred that element 65 should be a silicon avalanche photodiode, for example a TIED 69, also made by Texas Instruments. In contrast with the transformer coupling of Figure 1, the embodiment of Figure 15 is DC coupled, which may be advantageous in certain circumstances.In addition the low dynamic impedance of the LED 63 largely short circuits the capacitance between the shadow mask and screen. This makes it easier to achieve a large signal bandwidth. Figure 16 shows an embodiment using capacitors. EHT terminal 8 is connected directly to shadow mask 2 through conductors 4, and through resistor 66 and conductor 5 to conductive layer 3. The junction of resistor 66 and conductor 4 is connected to ground through by pass capacitor 67. The other end of resistor 66 is connected to terminal 10, at which a signal proportional to the screen current appears through a capacitor 68 which isolates the EHT from the circuitry connected to terminal 10. In the embodiment of Figure 15, an LED can be connected in conductor 5 and its output as detected by a radiation detector will represent the beam current generated at the screen. The outputs of the radiation detectors can be differenced in a conventional subtraction circuit to derive the difference currents. There has been described shadow mask colour cathode ray tube apparatus with means to derive a signal representative of the electron beam current intercepted by the shadow mask.This signal may be the electron beam current in the shadow mask, in the conductive layer at the screen of the tube, or the difference between these currents. The signals have been isolated from the EHT applied to the tube and screen by a transformer or by optical or capacitive decoupling. Shadow masks with aperture patterns such as to produce distinctive signals have also been described.
