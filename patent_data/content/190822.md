# Pressure control valve.

## Abstract
A pressure control valve for a selectively engageable friction device 10 has two flow rates for controlling piston movement during the application of the friction device. The valve 58 includes a spring loaded valve capsule 60 slidably disposed in a stepped diameter bore 44 between a feed passage 52 and a control passage 36 . When the fluid pressure in the feed passage exceeds the fluid pressure in the control passage by a predtermined amount, the capsule is thereby moved in the bore against the bias of the spring 70 so tht the outer cylindrical surface of the capsule and the largest diameter portion 46 or the bore co operate to form an orifice which permits a high flow rate, resulting in a rapid fill operation of the piston cylinder 24 of the friction device. The pressure in the piston cylinder, sensed in the control passage, and the biasing force of the spring move the capsule into the next largest diameter portion of the bore to provide a reduced flow during the final pressurization of the piston cylinder of the friction device. A cheque valve 62 in the capsule permits rapid exhausting of the friction device when the feed passage is exhausted.
