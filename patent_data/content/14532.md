# Exhaust gas sensor.

## Abstract
An exhaust gas sensor comprises a first exhaust gas sensing element 46 , composed, for example, of titania, responsive to temperature and to the partial pressure of oxygen, and a second similar metal oxide ceramic element 48 which also is responsive to exhaust gas sensor tempera ture, but is more slowly responsive to the partial pressure of oxygen in the exhaust gases. Changes in partial pressure of oxygen are detected by connecting the sensor elements 46,48 series with each other and with a source of electrical energy 60 and detecting the voltage change across one of the elements.
