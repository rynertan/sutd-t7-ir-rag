# Method of reducing storage losses in harvested sugar beets.

## Abstract
Harvested sugar beets are treated to reduce storage losses of recoverable sucrose by contacting the beets with propylene. The treatment may be effected by spraying an aqueous solution of propylene onto the beets, by dipping the beets into an aqueous solution of propylene, by con tacting the beets with gaseous propylene, or by other suit able means. Propylene concentrations less than about 750 ppm, preferably in the range of about 10 to about 500 ppm, and more preferably about 20 to about 200 ppm, are effective to reduce storage loss of recoverable sucrose.
