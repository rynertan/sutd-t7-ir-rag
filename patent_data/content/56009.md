# Multiple stage hydrocarbon conversion with gravity flowing catalyst particles.

## Abstract
A multiple stage catalytic conversion system is provided in which a hydrocarbonaceous charge stock and hydrogen flow serially through a plurality of catalytic reaction zones I IV , in each of which the catalyst particles are downwardly movable via gravity flow. At least four reaction zones are utilized, with the fresh feed and hydrogen reactant stream being split between the first and second reaction zones I,II . The flow 10 of that portion introduced into the second zone is restricted 11 . The effluent 12 from the first reaction zone I is also restricted 13 and then combined with the effluent 14 from the second reaction zone II . One portion of the combined effluent 16 is introduced into the third reaction zone III , and the remaining portion 17 is restricted in flow 18 , combined with the effluent 19 from said third reaction zones III , and introduced 21 into the fourth reaction zone IV . This technique decreases the mass flow to the first three zones I III and increases the pressure drop experienced within the entire conversion system, thus serving to alleviate the problems associated with the occurrence of stagnant catalyst areas as a result of catalyst particles being pinned within a reaction zone and thus unable to assume a downward gravity flow pattern. Restriction of the second zone feed 10 and first reaction zone effluent 12 ensures a higher pressure in the first zone I .
