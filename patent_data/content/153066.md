# Dual entry centrifugal compressor.

## Abstract
A dual entry radial compressor rotor 140 has two sets of alternating full length blades 152a, 154b and partial length blades 152b, 154b on a symmetrical hub 144 , with the par tial length blades 152b or 154b on one hub side terminating at the rotor high velocity exit coincident with the full length blades 154a or 152a on the other hub side, to smooth the gas velocity profile in the tangential direction. Aerodynamically shaped sawtooth profiled reliefs 172 are provided in the hub radial portion between the blade tips to allow induced pressure differentials between the flow paths to smooth the axial veloc ity profile.
