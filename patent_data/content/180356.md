# Preparation of alkoxy halides.

## Abstract
Alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl alkoxy halides are prepared by react ing the corresponding alkoxy alcohol with a halogenating agent, e.g. thionyl chloride, in the presence of a quaternary am monium compound as catalyst. In addition to being faster, the catalysed reaction results in an increased yield of desired product and a decrease in the ten dency of the polyoxyalkylene chain to cleave.

## Description
PREPARATION OF ALKOXY HALIDES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkyl alkoxy, aryl alkoxy or alkylaryl alkoxy halides suitable for use as intermediates in the preparation of surfactants. Numerous attempts have been made to develop surfactant compositions for use in enhanced oil recovery and the patent literature is replete with descriptions of formulations, see for example, USP s 4,424,135, 4,159,037, 4,110,228, 4,066,124 and 4,018,278. A useful summary of the art is given in Kirk Othmer sEncyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 17, pages 168 182. This indicates that most compositions contain a a main surfactant which is either a petroleum or a synthetic hydrocarbyl sulphonate and b co surfactants which include simple alcohols, ethoxylated alcohols and sulphated ethoxylated alcohols. It has also been disclosed that alkyl and alkylaryl polyalkoxy alkylene sulphonates may be used as co surfactants. These compounds are generally prepared by a three stage process. In the first stage of a typical process, an alcohol or alkyl phenol is condensed with an alkylene oxide in the presence of sodium or potassium hydroxide to form an alkoxylate. This is then halogenated by treatment with thionyl or sulphuryl chloride, usually in the absence of a catalyst. Finally the halide is converted to a sulphonate by reaction with sodium sulphite, again, usually in the absence of a catalyst. GB 1,499,618 discloses that the sulphonation of alkyl or alkyl aryl halides may be carried out under relatively mild conditions in the presence of a quaternary ammonium compound as catalyst. We have now discovered that the use of such a catalyst in the second stage, the halogenation stage, results in a shorter reaction period and an increased yield of desired product when compared with the uncatalysed reaction. Thus according to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of an alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl alkoxy halide which process comprises reacting an alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl alkoxy alcohol of formula R ORl m OH, with a halogenating agent in the presence of a quaternary ammonium compound as catalyst wherein R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or an alkyl phenyl group of formula EMI2.1 wherein R2 is an alkyl group containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms andR3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms, or K2 and R3 are both alkyl groups containing 4 to 12 carbon atoms and R4 is a hydrogen atom, orR2, R3 and R4 are each alkyl groups wherein the sum of the number of carbon atoms in the groups is in the range 8 to 24 R1 is an alkylene group containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms and m is a number in the range 1 to 15, preferably 4 to 10. Preferred catalysts are quaternary ammonium compounds of formula EMI2.2 in which R5, R6, R7 and R8 are hydrogen atoms or alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl groups containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, at least one being hydrocarbyl, or two of the radicals R5, R6, R7 and R8, together with the nitrogen atom, represent a heterocyclic ring andX denotes an anion, preferably a halide, most preferably a chloride ion. Preferably R5, R6 and R7 are hydrogen atoms and R8 is an alkyl group containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms. The catalyst may be bonded onto a polymer such as an ion exchange resin. Alternatively, the catalyst may be formed in situ by the reaction of an amine with the halogenating agent. Suitable amines include n propylamine, n octadecylamine, ethylenediamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine and pyridine. Preferred halogenating agents are chlorinating agents such as thionyl chloride and sulphuryl chloride. The halogenation reaction is suitably effected at a temperature in the range 30 to 100 C, preferably in the range 750 to 85 C. Pressure is not a significant parameter and the reaction is therefore most conveniently carried out at ambient pressure. The molar ratio of alkoxy alcohol to halogenating agent is suitably in the range 1 1 to 1 5, preferably 1 1 to 1 2.5. The quantity of catalyst employed is preferably in the range 0.1 to 5 by weight, expressed as a percentage by weight of the alkoxy alcohol. The reaction may be effected in the presence or, preferably, the absence of a solvent. Solvents which may be used include 1,2 dichloroethane, toluene and chloroform. As a result of the reduced reaction time, the tendency of the polyoxyalkylene chain to cleave noted by Robinson et al, J. Soc.Cosmet. Chem., 31, 329 337, is reduced. Thus both the yield and selectivity as indicated by the matching of the alkoxy distribution in the alcohol and the halide are improved, and product contamination with unwanted by product is reduced. The invention is illustrated with reference to the followingExamples 1 to 6. Examples 1 and 3 are not in accordance with the invention, however, and are provided for comparison. Example 1 2.25g 5 mM of the ethoxyalcohol C12H25 0CH2CH2 60H was heated under reflux at 860C with l.l9g 10 mM thionyl chloride in 30 ml of anhydrous 1,2 dichloroethane. Thin Layer Chromatography TLC indicated that a time in excess of 4 hours was necessary to achieve quantitative chlorination. The product was isolated after 8 hours by pumping in vacuo. Gas Liquid Chromatography GLC indicated that 74.8 6 ethoxychloride and 22.7 4 ethoxychloride were produced and that 1,4 dioxan production was consistent with this ethoxy group loss.Mass Spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the ethoxychlorides and 1,4 dioxan. 111 NMR spectroscopy gave a consistent average ethoxylate value for ethoxychloride product of 5.6. Example 2 1.13g 2.5 mH of the ethoxyalcohol C12H25 0CH2CH2 60H was heated under reflux at 860C with 0.6g 5 mM of thionyl chloride and 10 mg 0.9 methyltrioctylammonium chloride in 30 ml of anhydrous 1,2 dichloroethane. The product was isolated by evaporation of solvent and volatile reagent. TLC indicated that quantitative chlorination was complete after 0.5 hours. GLC indicated that 93.5 6 ethoxychloride and 4.3 4 ethoxychloride were produced and that 1,4 dioxan production was reduced to 10 of that in Example 1. 1H NMR spectroscopy gave an ethoxychloride ethoxylate value of 5.9. Example 3 61.65g 0.11 M of the ethoxyalcohol C18H37Ph OCR2CH2 50H was heated with stirring at 800C with 14g 0.12 M thionyl chloride in the absence of solvent. The product was isolated by pumping in vacuo. 13C NHK spectroscopy indicated 95 conversion to ethoxychloride after 4 hours and GLC indicated the production of 0.08 mole of 1,4 dioxan per mole ethoxyalcohol. Example 4 87.23g 0.15M of the ethoxyalcohol C18H3 7Ph OCH2CH2 50H was heated with stirring at 800C with 19.75g 0.17M thionyl chloride and 0.87g 1X methyltrioctylammonium chloride in the absence of solvent. The product was isolated by pumping in vacuo. 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated quantitative chlorination after 0.25 hours. GLC indicated the production of 0.01 mole of 1,4 dioxan per mole ethoxyalcohol. It should be noted when comparing Examples 1 and 2 that addition of the catalyst resulted in at least an eight fold increase in the chlorination rate in addition to reducing the dioxan production to 1 10 of its previous value. Examples 3 and 4 show that the addition of the catalyst increased the chlorination rate sixteen fold and reduced the production of dioxan to 1 8 of its previous value. Example 5 1.13g 2.5 mM of the ethoxyalcohol C12H25 0CH2CH2 60H was heated under reflux at 860C with 0.6g 5 mM of thionyl chloride and 10 mg 0.9 of l aminooctadecane in 30 ml anhydrous 1,2 dichloroethane. The product was isolated as before. TLC indicated quantitative chlorination after 1 hour. GLC indicated that 98 6 ethoxychloride and 2 4 ethoxychloride were produced. In comparison with the uncatalysed reaction of Example 1, catalysis by this amine increased the reaction rate at least fourfold and reduced 4 ethoxychloride production by ethoxy chain cleavage to a very low level. Example 6 1.13g 2.5 mM of the ethoxyalcohol C12H25 oCH2CH2 6oH was heated under reflux at 800C with 0.6g 5 mM of thionyl chloride and 10 mg 0.9 of l aminopropane in the absence of a solvent. The product was isolated as before. TLC indicated complete chlorination after 0.5 hours. GLC indicated that 96Z 6 ethoxychloride and 4 4 ethoxychloride were produced. In comparison with the uncatalysed reaction of Example 1, the presence of l aminopropane increased the rate of reaction at least eightfold and reduced 4 ethoxychloride production by ethoxy chain cleavage from 22.7 to 4 .
