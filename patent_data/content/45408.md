## Description
The present invention relates to immediately useful abrasive products comprising a flexible backing on at least one side of which are adhered abrasive grits, such products being referred to in the art as coated abrasives more particularly it relates to endless abrasive belts formed from such coated abrasive products. Coated abrasives, in general, have been made on backings ranging from paper, cloth, leather, to plastic films and metal sheets. Except for specialty items the greater majority of all coated abrasive products are made on paper or woven cloth backings. Coated abrasives, often subject to high stresses in operation, are made from strong paper backings, vulcanized fiber backings, or, for strength and flexibility, woven cloth backings. Laminates of various of these materials have also been used and taught in the patent literature. Problems connected with the use of woven cloth as a backing for coated abrasive articles, and for belts in particular, are the elongation characteristic inherent in woven cloth, due to the repeated curvature in the yarns, inherently produced by the interlaced nature of the material, and a weakening of the material in certain circumstances due to the inherent presence of knuckles at the crossover points in the yarn. Knuckles are the small bumps on the surface of woven cloth caused by yarns curving to cross over other yarns. The presence of such knuckles is believed to be responsible for the catastrophic failure of coated abrasive articles, particularly belts, in certain severe grinding operations. The desirable properties of woven textiles as a backing material for coated abrasives are retained, and many of the undesirable properties are avoided by the use, in the present invention, of arrays of substantially coplanar and coparallel textile yarns, which are not woven but are bonded into the structure of the coated abrasives by other means. Theoretically ideal properties for coated abrasives would be expected for backings in which the arrays of yarns are exactly coplanar and coparallel. However, such exactitude in the arraying of the yarns is neither practical nor necessary to derive benefit from the use of this invention. For the purposes of the present invention, an array of yarns is substantially coplanar if all the yarns of the array can be accomodated in the space between two parallel planes which are separated by a distance of four times the average diameter of the yarns in the array. An array is substantially coparallel if the largest angular difference in direction between any two yarns in the array is no more than thirty degrees. The use of such fabrics as stitch bonded Malimo fabrics, or adhesive bonded layers of oriented yarns, results in the elimination of many of the disadvantages referred to above in connection with the use of conventional woven cloth. Thus, the elongation and failure problems caused by the presence of knuckles in the woven cloth are avoided. A major advantage of the non interlaced fabrics when employed as substrates for coated abrasive is the fact that such fabrics can be produced at much higher rates of speed than can conventional woven textiles, thus increasinq the productivity and lowering the cost of manufacture. Referring specifically to the stitch bonded,Malimo type fabrics, these materials are produced by laying fill yarns over warp yarns and, with a third yarn, stitching the warp and fill yarns together. Because of the space requirement for the multiple stitching needles, there is an upper limit on the number of warp ends per inch in such fabrics. Because of this, the stitch bonded fabrics tend to be or may be of more open construction than conventional woven cloth for coated abrasive use. The greater openness, combined with the use of strong multifilament yarns permits desiqn of fabric having lower weight than conventional woven fabrics of the same or lower strength and tear resistance, thus economizing on the use of raw materials. Thus special procedures may be required in filling the spaces between the yarn in such fabrics.The overall production of coated abrasive from stitch bonded fabrics is, however, closely analogous to production from conventional woven cloth. The steps of sizing the yarn, back filling or sizing, saturating, front sizing, applying a maker coat, applying abrasive, and finally applying a sand size coat may all be used in coated abrasive production from theMalimo type, or stitch bonded fabrics. Adhesive bonded fabrics may be produced in a similar manner as the stitch bonded, but with an application of suitable adhesive, at the point in the manufacture where otherwise the third yarn would be used to stitch bond the warp and crossinq threads together. Similarly the thermally bonded fabrics mav be produced by applying heat at the points of junction of the warp and cross threads to fuse or soften the yarns or a coating previously applied to the yarns. In some cases it may be desirable to insert a thin tissue sheetinq between the warp and fill yarns, to aid in preventing the back fill treatment from penetrating too far into the cloth. This can be done in the Malimo machine during the manufacture of the backing. Instead of oriented fill yarns, a random web of fill yarns can be employed, as in the Maliwatt type ofMalimo fabric as opposed to the Malimo type . Such web should be selected to contain fibers which present sufficient surface for good adhesion. Machines are available such as the Model 14001 which will produce both the Malimo type and the Maliwatt type fabrics. The present invention is particularly suitable for producing coated abrasive stock suitable for forming coated abrasive belts. The ability to control the longitudinal strength and stretch properties of the material are important in this reqard. While the total strength of a woven fabric in the warp direction cannot always be predicted by summing the strenqths of the individual warp yarns and the stretch properties can almost never be predicted from the stretch of the individual yarns, both these properties can be more readily controlled and predicted in the fabric designs employed in the present invention. In addition any tendency of coated abrasive belts to split when subject to stresses in use due to the effect of the interlaced filling weft yarns is eliminated by the use of the non interlaced backing construction disclosed herein. By non interlaced backing , I mean a backing reinforced with non interlaced arrays of substantially coplanar and coparallel yarns as described above. The particular finishing materials employed are not critical and many variations are possible provided proper cover and adhesion are achieved. Important aspects of the finishing are obtaining good adhesion to the backing, properly filling the cloth and preparing its surface for the maker coat to hold the abrasive, and adequately bondinq the yarns so that the end product resists delamination, splitting, and tearing. Adequate flexibility for the end use intended is also important. Thus the particular chemical structure of the finishing compositions is not critical, except to the extent that it affects the physical properties described above. Other methods than the Malimo machine may be used to produce the arrays of yarns which are useful in preparing the non interlaced backings of this invention. For example, prepared cut to length crossing yarns may be laid across an array of warp yarns, for example at right angles, by a suitable machine, or manually. The warp and overlaid yarns may then be consolidated by a stitching yarn or by adhesive means. U.S. Patent 3,250,655 shows an adhesively bonded fabric of this type. Other machines are known which wind a filling so called array of yarns around the longitudinal warp yarns arrayed in a tubular configuration. Other machines or methods such as weft insertion machines can be employed to produce yarns arrays suitable for the present invention. The presently preferred material for the warp yarns is continuous filament polyester having relatively high strength and low elongation properties. Obviously other yarns of similar or higher strength properties and similar or lower elongation under load, may be used. In less critical applications yarns with less strength and higher elongation could be used, and other advantages of the present invention be still retained. Besides the various synthetic organic yarns, glass or metal yarns may be employed as part or all of the yarn arrays. The preferred yarns in the fill direction are texturized continuous filament synthetic yarns, as in the example below. Natural and synthetic staple fiber textile yarns may be employed. Continuous filament yarns are particularly useful if they are texturized, given a false twist, or are otherwise produced to have a high bulk or surface area so that good adhesion to the cloth finishing materials is achieved. The following are examples of specific embodiments of the invention. Example 1 This example, a preferred construction, employs a stitch bonded backing of the type disclosed in Figure 9 of U.S. Patent 2,890,579. The fabric of the example was made on a Malimo machine available fromUnitechna Aussenhandelqesellschaft mbH, DDR 108 Berlin,Mohrenstrasse 53 54 GDR . The approximately 4 inch wide carrier for the fill yarns holds 61 ends, and makes one complete cycle from one edge of the web and back for every 4 inch longitudinal forward motion of the web. For a 60 inch wide machine this produces a fill which crosses the warp yarns at an angle of about 88 in one direction and 92e in the other. The stitching yarns, which bind the warp to the fill are 70 denier continuous filament polyester. The stitch length is 1.2 mm.The warp yarns are 1000 denier duPont type 68 continuous filament high tenacity polyester 9.2 grams per denier breaking strength , and the warp count is 14 ends per inch. The fill yarns are continuous filament 170 denier containing 33 filaments available from CelaneseCorporation as type 731 polyester. These yarns have a low twist 0.25 per inch and are texturized to provide a bulky yarn for optimum adhesion to coatings later applied. The tenacity is 3.5 to 3.9 grams denier and the elongation is 18 to 24 at break. The yarn is preferably not treated with a coning oil. The above described backing was then saturated with a resin and acrylic latex composition to prepare it for front fillinq, back filling, and coating with maker grain and size coat. A heat settinq step is combined with the drying of the saturant. The fabric finishing steps will now be described in more detail.Saturation and Heat Setting Standard sizing rolls are employed to apply the following composition in the amount of 3 to 4 pounds per sandpaper makers ream 330 sauare feet . The fill yarn side of the fabric was facing up. Saturant Composition Cymel 482, available from American Cyanamid, a melamine formaldehyde resin syrup 80 solids, pH 8 to 9 160 partsBeetle 7238, available from American Cyanamid, a urea formaldehyde resin syrup 124 parts water 120 parts aqueous solution containing 15 NH4C1 and 24 2 amino 2 methyl propanol 13 parts 5 to 7 parts pigment dispersions may be added to color backing. Upon completion of the application of the saturant the fabric is dried on a tenter frame for at least 3 minutes in a hot air oven in which the temperature in the entry zone is 205 F, and the temperature at the exit zone is 350 F. A tension of at least 2 pounds per inch of width is maintained on the fabric during its travel through the oven. This process not only dries the saturant but also heat sets the fabric.Front Fill Coasting The composition of the front fill coating, applied to the fill yarn side in this example, but which can instead be applied to the warp yarn side if desired, is as follows 1 phenol formaldehyde A stage resol resin syrup having a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of 1.5 and a solids content of 78 199 parts 2 CaCO3 160 parts 3 sodium lauryl sulfate 2 parts 4 Hycar 2600 x 138, a latex of an acrylic acid ester polymer having a qlass transition temperature at 25 C available from B. F. Goodrich Chemical Company 54 parts The front fill coatinq composition is applied with a box knife in the amount of 10 to 11 pounds per ream, and water may be added as necessary to maintain the required viscosity for proper coating.The coated cloth is again dried on a tenter frame with a tension of at least 2 pounds per inch of width by passinq through a hot air oven in which the entry temperature is 205 F and the exit zone temperature is 300 F. Back Fill Coating J To the side not coated with the front fill is applied a back fill of the following composition. 1 Beetle 7238 urea formaldehyde resin syrup available from American Cyanamid 133 parts 2 Nopco NXZ anti foam agent, available from Nopco Chemical Co., Newark, New Jersey 5.3 parts 3 UCAR 151 adhesive, a polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate 60 aqueous dispersion, available from Union Carbide Corporation, having a pH of 4 to 6 133 parts 4 air washed clay 176 pounds 5 aqueous solution containing 15 NH4C1 and 24 2 amino 2 methyl propanol 5.3 parts 6 water to adjust viscosity to 11000 cps at room temperature, as needed pigment may be added if desired to color backing . The composition is applied by knife coating in the amount of 10 pounds per ream, and dried in an oven having an entry zone temperature of 1500F and an exit zone of 200 F. The thus coated fabric is now ready for application of a maker coat of phenolic resin, the application of abrasive, and the application of an abrasive size coat, as is conventional and well known in the art. A suitable formulation to be applied to the front sized side of the backing is as follows 1 phenol formaldehyde alkaline catalyzed resol resin, F P factor 2.08, pH 8.7, solids 78 in water 7 parts 2 phenol formaldehyde alkaline catlayzed resol resin, F P 0.94, pH 8.1, solids in H2O 78 3 parts 3 CaCO3 1.54 x total solids To the adhesively coated fabric is then applied by conventional electrostatic means 35.4 lbs. sandpaper maker s ream 330 square feet grit 60 high purity aluminum oxide abrasive grain.The abrasive adhesive coated backing member is then heated for 25 minutes at 170 F., 25 minutes at 190 F., and 47 minutes at 225 F. to provide a dry adhesive layer 17.4 lbs. S.P.M.R. and to anchor the abrasive grains in the desired orientation. Afterwards, a size coat 10.6 lbs. S.P.M.R. dry of the same composition as the maker coat, except of lesser viscosity, is then applied according to usual techniques.The wet adhesive layer is then dried 25 minutes at 125 F., 25 minutes at 135 F., 18 minutes at 180 F., 25 minutes at 1900F., and 15 minutes at 225 F., after which a final cure at 2300 F. for 8 hours is given. The coated abrasive material is then ready to be converted according to usual techniques, into belts, discs, and other desired abrasive products. While the above example described finishing the backing with the abrasive coat on the fill side of the cloth, in other cases it may be more desirable to coat on the warp side. It should be noted that a central feature of the invention is the use of yarn arrays which are not interlaced as in conventional woven fabrics, and the use of the terms warp and fill in the description of fabrics bonded by other means than weaving does not imply such interlacing. The abrasive sheet material of the above example can be formed into belts by conventional joining techniques well known in the art. Particularly suitable are the butt joints described in U.S. Patents 3,665,600 and 3,787,273.Lapped joints as described in U.S. Patent 4,194,618 may also be used. In such cases it may be desirable to apply the front fill coating and the abrasive and maker on the warp side of the backing, instead of on the fill side. In the case of butt joints, the backing may be coated on either one side or the other.Example 2 An adhesively bound coated abrasive backing of this invention was prepared by crossing two sets of substantially parallel spun polyester yarn 3 5 gm denier tenacity, 19 singles, cotton count between the top and bottom platens of a photographic dry mounting press manufactured by Seal, Inc. , the upper platen of which is electrically heated to a temperature of 340 to 350CF. A sheet of polyamide hot melt adhesive web Bostik No. 5350 available from USM Corp. was inserted between the yarn layers and the press closed to fuse and set the adhesive. A laminating time of approximately 45 seconds was used. The press was opened, the cross direction yarn beam cut free, and the machine direction yarn beam advanced to bring the next adjacent portion of yarn over the bottom platen of the press.The cross direction yarn beam was then brought through the press to cross the other beam and the bonding process repeated. Approximately 8 yards of fabric was prepared in this manner. The fabric so prepared contained a density of 93 yarns inch in the machine direction and 47 yarns inch in the cross direction, yielding a calculated areal weight of 6.81 oz yd2. The count and density of fabrics thus prepared are readily varied by varying the counts and weights of yarn s used in the respective beams. The fabric was then heat stretched by passing it over a catenary shaped surface at a speed of 20 ft min while under a linear tension of 15 lbs inch of width. During this operation, the fabric was heated to 400 F by infrared radiators on the opposite side of the web from the catenary surface. In this way the machine direction breaking strength of the fabric was increased from 158 lbs inch of width to 179 lbs inch of width, and the elongation to break of the fabric was reduced from 32 to 20 . The following formulation was then applied to the cross direction side of the heat stretched fabric, using a conventional bar coater with a .017 inch gap 1 Duracryl 820, a 45 solids acrylic 133 parts latex, available from Charles S. Tanner Inc., Greenville, S.C. 2 An alkaline catalyzed bisphenol 87 parts formaldehyde resin syrup, F P factor 4.18, at 73 solids. 3 Calcium carbonate 200 parts 4 Alfonic 1012 60, a non ionic surfactant, 7 16 parts available from Charles S. Tanner Co. 5 Water 25 parts A drying time of 2 min. at 200 F was used. After drying, the machine direction side of this fabric was then coated to 20 lbs sandpaper ream with a conventional laboratory knife on roll coater using the following frontsize formulation 1 An alkaline catalyzed bisphenol formaldehyde 195 parts resin syrup, F P factor 4.18, at 73 solids. 2 An alkaline catalyzed phenol formaldehyde 20 parts resin syrup, F P factor 0.94, at 78 solids. 3 CaCO3 150 parts 4 Alfonic 1012 60, a non ionic surfactant 3.6 parts available from Charles S. Tanner Co. 5 Water 45 partsThis material was then oven dried for 5 minutes at 250 F. The thus prepared fabric was now ready for application of a maker coat of phenolic resin, the application of abrasive, and the application of an abrasive size coat, as is conventional and well known in the art. In recognition of readiness for the application of maker adhesive and abrasive grain, the thus prepared fabric may be henceforward denoted as a backing. A typical formulation applied to the front sized side i.e., the side on which machine direction yarns were originally exposed of the backing was as follows 1 phenol formaldehyde alkaline catalyzed 7 parts resol resin, F P factor 2.08, pH 8.7, solids 78 in water. 2 phenol formaldehyde alkaline catalyzed resol 3 parts resin, F P 0.94, pH 8.1, solids in H20 78 . 3 CaC03 1.54 x total solids To the adhesively bonded backing was then applied by conventional electrostatic means 50 lbs sandpaper maker s ream 330 square feet grit 50 eutectic composition, Al203 ZrO2 abrasive grain available from Norton Co.,Worcester, Massachusetts . The abrasive adhesive coated backing member was then heated for 25 minutes at 170 F, 25 minutes at 1900F, and 47 minutes at 225 F to provide a dry adhesive layer 17.4 lbs S.P.M.R. and to anchor the abrasive grains in the desired orientation. Afterwards, a size coat of the same composition as the maker coat, except of lesser viscosity, was then applied according to usual techniques. The wet adhesive layer was then dried 25 minutes at 125 F, 25 minutes at 135 F, 18 minutes at 1800F, 25 minutes at 1900F and 15 minutes at 225 F, after which a final cure at 230 F for 8 hours is given. The coated abrasive material was then ready to be manufactured according to usual techniques, into belts, discs, and other desired abrasive products. A sample of coated abrasive material, thus prepared, was converted into 2 1 2 x 60 abrasive belt products. Other coated abrasive belts were also prepared, using the same means and formulations as the material of this invention, with the exception that the backing substrate fabric used was a conventionally woven polyester spun yarn backing 2 x 1 drills construction 66 ends per inch and 44 picks per inch yarn 3 5 gm denier, warp, 12 s and filling, 15 s cotton count . The warp twill side of this cloth was used as the frontside. The product of this invention, using the previously disclosed adhesively bound backing Product A was compared to the product prepared by using the conventionally interwoven backing Product B in a series of grinding operations. Test 1 Four different bars of AISI C1018 steel 1 2 2 1 2 x 9 3 4 were alternately qround on their narrow faces with a test machine which used a 55 durometer cog tooth contact wheel, at 15 lbs deadweight force, operating at a belt speed of 5000 surface feet per minute. Two belts of each product type, with the running direction of the belts coinciding with the warp or machine direction of the backing, were tested. The end of the useful life of each belt was judged to have occurred when no more than 5.0 grams of steel could be removed during a 2.0 minute period of continuous grinding. Total Weight of Steel RemovedProduct A belt 1 609 gramsProduct B belt num 2 608 gramsProduct A belt 2 639 gramsProduct B belt X2 619 gramsTest 2 In this test, a piece of AISI 1020 hot rolled steel angle iron 1 8 x 1 x 9 3 4 was ground at a 15C angle to one of its 1 8 faces. A 90 durometer plain face rubber contact was used with a belt speed of 5000 surface feet per minute. The force used to apply the abrasive was approximately 8.5 lbs of deadweiqbt. In this application, abrasive grain, and the maker and size adhesive coats are normally shed from the backing at a high rate. The end of the useful life of the product normally occurs when all of the abrasive grain has been stripped from the backing. Time to Shed Grams of Steel RemovedProduct A belt num 1 5.0 minutes 166Product B belt num 1 3.5 minutes 99Product A belt num 2 5.0 minutes 158Product B belt i2 3.5 minutes 94 In the case of product B, wherein the backing used was of conventional woven design, both belts tested showed evidence of severe damage to the filling yarn, with the second belt of the two splitting and breakinq apart to terminate the test. No such damage was found to have occurred to the backing of the product A herein disclosed. Example 2 above has illustrated one of the coated abrasives of this invention having a backing without bonding yarns of any kind. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that many variations from this specific example could be made within the scope of this invention. For example, if greater economy in the product were necessary, the cross direction set of reinforcing yarns could have been eliminated. Belts made from the product would then have had less resistance to splitting but could have been satisfactory for certain uses. The choice of adhesive could be varied within wide limits to give the combination of flexibility and damage resistance most suitable to the intended use of the coated abrasive product. It should also be readily appreciated that more complex mechanical arrangements could be used to assemble the material described in Example 1 or 2 at higher speed. A variety of methods for different adhesives are described inU.S. Patent 3,250,655.Example 3 If greater economy than obtained with example 1 is desired, and reduced splitting resistance may be tolerated, a suitable backing can be made with only one array of reinforcinq yarns. For example, cotton 18 s singles yarn was wound onto the surface of a cylinder coated with polytetrafluoroethylene at a spacing to give 72 yarns per inch when measured parallel to the axis of the cylinder. A coating of Hycar 2679X6, an acrylic polymer latex adhesive supplied commercially by B. F. Goodrich Chemical Company, was then applied in sufficient thickness to completely cover the layer of yarn. The cylinder with its wet coasting of. adhesive was turned slowly in slightly warmer than ambient air until the adhesive had dried completely to a continuous film encapsulating the cotton yarns. A cut was then made alonq a line on the surface of the dried composite parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and the resultinq sheet of yarn adhesive composite stripped from the cylinder. The yarn adhesive composite is then used as the backing for the preparation of a coated abrasive, using the same maker and size adhesives and abrasive grain and the same techniques as described for example 1 and 2.
