# Calendars.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a calendar having a stack of date bearing leaves 11 for the earliest dated leaf at the front of the stack, the leaves being detachable from the stack day by day so that the front leaf displays the current date. Each leaf 10 of the stack comprises a plastics film bag open at the upper end so that when the leaf is detached at its upper edge from the stack, the bag form leaf can be used for receiving trash or other material.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A calendar comprising a stack of leaves or sheets bearing a sequence of dates and bound together with the earliest date at the front of the stack, and leaves or sheets being individually detachable so that, by removal of leaves, the current date is displayed at the front of the stack, each leaf or sheet of the stack comprising a bag to serve as a receptacle when the function as a part of the calendar has been served. 2. A calendar as claimed in claim 1, wherein the leaves are bound together at one edge of the stack to be torn off one by one as required. 3. A calendar as claimed in claim 2, wherein the leaves are bound together by rings extending through the stack adjacent said one edge at spaced locations along the edge. 4, A calendar as claimed in claim 3, wherein the rings also extend through a mounting board from which the stack can be suspended by the rings. 5. A calendar as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4 wherein the leaves each comprise a rectangular bag open at one end and are bound together at the open end thereof. 6. A calendar as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the leaves are formed from plastics film material.

## Description
C A L E N D A R S This invention relates to calendars comprising a stack of leaves or sheets bearing a seguence of dates and bound together with the earliest date at the front of the stack, the leaves or sheets being individually detachable so that, by removal of leaves the current date is displayed at the front of the stack. The invention provides a calendar comprising a stack of leaves or sheets bearing a sequence of dates and bound together with the earliest date at the front of the stack, the leaves or sheets being individually detachable so that, by removal of leaves, the current date is displayed at the front of the stack, each leaf or sheet of the stack comprising a bag to serve as a receptacle when the function as a part of the calendar has been served. It is well known that it is characteristic of prevalent traditional tear a page a day type calendar to be torn off each day and thence discarded as a piece of trash, thus it will not only serve to waste use of paper or tissue but also add more trash by itself and thus producing more environmental pollution in the long run. The present invention thus provides a simple and effectual calendar and also, as dates pass and calendar leaves are detached, bags from the leaves for trash or other material, Thus each calendar leaf after use for its display function is re used as a container for wastes, such leaves otherwise becoming pieces of waste themselves as is the case with conventional tear a page a day or month calendars. The following is a description of a specific embodiment of the invention reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a front perspective view of a calendar having a stack of detachable date bearing leaves in the form of plastic bags and Figure 2 illustrates one bag form leaf after detachment from the stack. Referring to the drawings there is shown a calendar comprising a stack of leaves indicated at 11 dated in sequence from the front of the stack. The stack is hung from a nail or other fixing 2 in a supporting wall by a plastics rope or thread 3 extending over the nail and connected at spaced locations to horizontally extending oblong board 4. The upper edge of the board 4 is formed with spaced apertures 5 in which the ends of the rope 3 are fixed, The stack of leaves 11 is hung from the board by means of two spaced strips or rings 7 passing through spaced holes 6 towards the lower edge of the board and are threaded through spaced holes 9 adjacent the upper edges of each of the leaves 10 of the stack of leaves.As indicated earlier, the dates of the year are printed in sequence on the front face of each of the leaves of the stack to be removed one by one as the days pass so that the leaf at the front of the stack displays the current date. Each leaf of the calendar comprises a bag formed from plastics film open at the upper end so that when the leaf is detached from the stack by tearing the strips or rings 7 through the top edge of the stack, the leaf can serve as a bag for trash or other material as illustrated in Figure 2. The invention thus provides a calendar of conventional appearance and which has the dual purpose of displaying the date and also providing a receptacle fqr trash or other material as the leaves of the calendar are detached from the stack when they are no longer required for the date display function.The costs of the calendar can be minimised by retrieving and recycling the plastics leaves once they have served their required purposes
