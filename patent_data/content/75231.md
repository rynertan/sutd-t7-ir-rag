# Process for providing a matt surface on a photographic material and photographic material provided with such matt surface.

## Abstract
A matt surface can be provided on a photographic material comprising a support base, one or more light sensitive gelatin sliver halide emulsion layers and an outer non light sensitive gelatin layer coated on said layers if discrete particles, insoluble in water and sub stantially soluble in aqueous alkaline medium, of a car boxy group containing copolymer are introduced into said outer layer. The particles, of a diameter between 0.5 and 4 micron, are introduced into the coating com position of the outer layer as a dispersion of a meth acrylic acid and ethylmethacrylate copolymer containing 20 to 50 per cent by weight of methacrylic acid, which dispersion is obtained by dispersing in an aqueous so lution of a hydrophilic colloid a solution of said co polymer in ethylacetate or water including ethylacetate.
