# Surgical clip applier with in line cartridge and interruptable biased feeder.

## Abstract
An instrument is provided for applying ligating clips from a magazine. The magazine has an open rear end and an open front end. A toothed pusher bar is urged forwardly by a spring into the magazine to push a row of clips forwardly so as to position one clip between a pair of jaws. The jaws are actuated to close the clip by a pair of scissors type handles. As the scissors type handles are closed, a toothed pawl carried on one of the handles engages the teeth on the pusher bar to disengage the pusher bar from the last clip in the magazine so as to eliminate the imposition of undesir able forces on the row of clips in the magazine during the application of the front clip.
