# Biological sewage treatment apparatus of the rotary disc type.

## Abstract
In a sewage treatment apparatus comprising a rotary shaft 1 and a plurality of rotary plates 2 se cured to the rotary shaft in an axially spaced apart re lationship, each of said rotary plates being adapted to be rotated while it is partly dipped in sewage within a treating tank 4 , a plurality of holding members 5 are fixedly provided around the rotary shaft for rotation therewith, and said rotary plates are secured such that at least one rotary plate is fixedly held at its central end portion between every two adjacent holding mem bers. The sewage treatment apparatus can be easily as sembled at the site of installation. Despite of the rela tively large diameter of the rotary plates, the apparatus can be relatively easily assembled, even when each rotary plate is made up of a plurality of fan shaped plates. The apparatus is of special use suitable when the rotary plates and holding members are made of a thin plastics plate. The rotary plates are firmly secured to the rotary shaft. The apparatus withstands the forces exerted in operation excellently, and is thus scarcely likely to be damaged.
