# Track assembly with optical inspection device.

## Abstract
A track assembly adapted for use with crawler type vehicles of the type including a joint having a shaft 100 , an element 102 journalled on the shaft, a lubricant port 106 opening to one end of the shaft and in fluid communication with the interface of the shaft and the element, and a removable plug 38 received in the port 106 for confining lubricant therein. The plug 38 is an elastomeric sleeve having a frusto conical outer surface and a rod of transluscent material received within and sealed against the sleeve. The presence or absence of lubricant within the port 106 is ascertained by optical inspection of the end of the rod exterior of the port without removing the plug from the port.
