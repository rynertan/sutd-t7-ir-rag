3,6, 7,8 SUBSTITUTED s TRIAZOLO 4, 3 b PYRIDAZINES AND COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEM The present invention relates to new pharmacologically active heterocyclic compounds.More particularly, the invention relates to 3,6,7,8 substituted s triazolo 4, 3 b pyridazines corresponding to the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R3 represents hydrogen or loweralkyl. R6 represents amino, loweralkylamino, diloweralkylamino, or heterocyclic amino or lower alkyl substituted heterocyclic amino, wherein the heterocyclic moiety forms a 5, 6 or 7 membered ring, having one or two ring nitrogen atoms and zero or one ring sulfur or oxygen atom and wherein R7 represents loweralkyl wherein R8 represents hydrogen or loweralkyl and R7 and R8 taken together independently represent polymethylene or substituted polymethylene of 3 or 4 methylene units, e.g., CH2 CH2 n wherein n is 2 or 3 substituted by loweralkyl, or methano or ethano bridges and to pharmacologically acceptable salts of said compounds.The compounds wherein R7 and R8 are polymethylene or substituted polymethylene having four methylene units can be named either as s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazines or as 7,8,9,10 tetrahydro 1,2,4 triazolo 3,4 a phthalazines. When so named, the 7,8,9 and 10 positions refer to the carbons of the tetramethylene group attached to the pyridazine residue. A preferred group of such compounds are those corresponding to Formula I in which R7 and R8, taken together are polymethylene or bridged polymethylene, said bridged polymethylene compounds corresponding to the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R3 and R6 have the above significance, andB represents methylene or ethylene. Compounds ofFormula II can be named as substituted triazolopyridazines or as tetrahydrotriazolophthalazines. In the present specification and claims the terms loweralkyl and lower alkoxy refer to compounds containing one, two, three or four carbon atoms and halo refers to fluoro, chloro or bromo. The invention is inclusive of subgroups of compounds of the above formula, for example, those wherein R3 is hydrogen those wherein R3 and R8 are both hydrogen those wherein R3 represents hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl those wherein R6 is pyrrolidino, those wherein R7 and R8 are substituted polymethylene substituted by loweralkyl, methano or ethano, those wherein R6 is piperidino those wherein R6 is morpholino or thiamorpholino those wherein R6 is amino those wherein R6 is azepinyl or diazepinyl or those wherein R6 is Methyl piperazino those wherein R7 and R8 are polymethylene those whereinR7 and R8 are substituted polymethylene, substituted with methano, etc. Such subgroups are apparent from the above description and the following specification and further listing is omitted for the sake of brevity.Preferred groups of compounds comprise those wherein the loweralkyl is methyl those wherein R3 is hydrogen those wherein R6 is pyrrolidino, piperidino 2 methylpyrrolidino, hexahydro lH azepin l yl, or 4 methyl hexahydro lH 1,4 diazepin l yl those wherein R3 is hydrogen or methyl and those whereinR7 and R8 are polymethylene, with or without a methano or ethano bridge. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by the reaction of a 3 halo 6 hydrazinopyridazine of formula III with a substituted carboxyl compound of formula IVEMI4.1 wherein R3, R7 and R8 have the above significance and wherein X is halo, generally at a temperature of 400 to 1500C, preferably 1000 to 1300C, in an excess of acid optionally diluted with an inert solvent, having a boiling point of 400 to 2000C, preferably 750 to 1750C, followed by reacting the resulting 6 halo triazolopyridazine with the corresponding R6 amine, at a temperature of 750 to 1600C, preferably 1000 to 1400C, in the same solvent employed for the reaction of compounds III and IV.Useful solvents include either an inert organic solvent or a hydroxylic solvent such as, for example, water,C1 C4 alkanols and their admixtures with water, C1 C4 alkoxy alkanols, glycol ethers, dioxane, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorobenzene and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride. The reactions are preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure, although higher pressures may be employed if desired. Thus, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by first reacting a 3 chloro 6 hydrazinopyridazine with an appropriate acid of formula IV. This reaction proceeds when the reactants are contacted and mixed, preferably at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture. The first step of the reaction is preferably carried out in an excess of the reacting acid, the excess acid serving as reaction medium or component thereof.The 6 halo triazolopyridazine product can be recovered from the reaction mixture by evaporation to remove the excess acid reaction medium and can be purified by conventional procedures such as recrystallization and washing. The substituted 6 halo triazolopyridazine, in an appropriate solvent, is then reacted with excess R6 amine e.g. at least two fold on a molar basis or the R6 amine in the presence of an inorganic base such as, for example, sodium carbonate or a non nucleophilic amine, as hydrogen halide acceptor. The reaction is preferably carried out at the boiling temperature, using excess R6 base. The product is recovered by conventional procedures such as concentration under reduced pressure. The starting materials for the above method can be prepared by procedures which are known. The necessary pyridazines for the method above are obtained by reacting the appropriate 3,6 dihalo 4, 5 substituted pyridazine with hydrazine hydrate. In an alternative procedure for preparing substituted triazolopyridazines of Formulae I and II, a 3,6 dihalo 4,5 substituted pyridazine of Formula V EMI6.1 is reacted with the R6 amine to prepare a 3 halo pyridazine of Formula VIEMI6.2 The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent, as hereinbefore described, at a temperature of 250 to 1500C, preferably 50 to 1400C, in the presence of an inorganic base, such as, for example, sodium carbonate, a non nucleophilic amine, or an excess of the R6 amine, as a hydrogen halide acceptor. The resulting 3 halopyridazine is then reacted with a loweralkanoyl hydrazine of Formula VIIEMI6.3 preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst, in an inert liquid medium, preferably an oxygenated solvent such as, for example, analkylene glycol alkyl ether, at a temperature of from 50 to 2000C, preferably 1000 to 1750C. The generation of hydrogen halide during the reaction accelerates the reaction rate. The product is recovered and purified by conventional procedures. These reactions are preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure although higher pressures may be employed if desired. In the above formulae, R3, R6, R7 and R8 have the significance set out above with respect to FormulaeI IV. The hydrazino pyridazine starting materials can be prepared by known procedures. For example, 3,6 dichloro 4 methylpyridazine heated at reflux with excess hydrazine hydrate 50 percent in water for 0.3 to 1 hour produces 3 chloro 4 methyl 6 hydrazinopyridazine and 3 chloro 5 methyl 6 hydrazinopyridazine. The isomers can be separated by fractional crystallization using ethanol as a solvent. See, Takahayashi, Pharm. Bull., 5, 229 1957 Chem. Abstr. 52 6359, Linholter et al., Acta Chem. Scand. 16, 2389 1962 Chem. Abstr. 59 1632g, Steck et al., J.Amer. Chem. Soc., 76, 4454 1954 and Horning eft al., J.Org. Chem., 20, 707 1955 . When R7 and R8 are cyclopentylene or cyclohexylene, the dichloro intermediate is conveniently prepared from a 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 4,7 methano or ethano isobenzofuran 1,3 dione. Diels and Alder, Ann., 478, 149 1930 Ann., 490, 236 1931 . The dione compound is reacted with excess hydrazine hydrate in an exothermic reaction to produce the corresponding hexahydro 5,8 methano or ethano phthalazine l,4 dione. Additional heating at 1000 1700C for 10 30 minutes may be useful to complete the reaction. The phthalazine 1,4 dione is then reacted with excess phosphorus oxychloride heated at reflux for about 2 4 hours, cooled and the product hydrolyzed by careful addition of ice and water to produce the dichloro intermediate. The 3,6, 7,8 substituted s triazolo 4,3 bjpyri dazine compounds corresponding to the above formulae and their pharmacologically acceptable salts have useful biological activity as bronchodilators and also have a desirably low toxicity and freedom from undesirable side effects at dosages consistent with good bronchodilator activity. Some triazolopyridazines are known to have different properties. For example, 6 methyl 3 4 morpholinyl 8 phenyl s triazolo 4,3 pyridazine, rather than blocking histamine induced bronchoconstriction, has been found to potentiate bronchoconstriction. The compound 6 morpholino 3 phenyl s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine, although a potent bronchodilator with a high LD50 low toxicity , has been found to produce audiogenic convulsions in laboratory animals at relatively low dosages. See,U.S. Patent 4,136,182. The triazolopyridazine compounds are crystalline solids which can be readily formulated in aqueous or alcoholic liquids. In general, the free base compounds are readily soluble in aqueous liquids, and the triazolopyridazine compounds are conveniently employed in either free base or salt form. In practicing the method an effective bronchodilating amount of one or more substituted triazolopyridazine is administered internally to a mammal in need thereof by a route effective to bring the compound into contact with the bronchial and tracheal tissues of the mammal. Administration can be carried out either by a parenteral route, such as by intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular injection, or by introduction into the gastroinestinal tract via oral or rectal administration, for example, in order to bring about such contact via the blood stream, or by intratracheal administration, by inhalation of a solution in the form of a spray, for example. The effective bronchodilating amount of the compound, that is, the amount of the substituted triazolopyridazine sufficient to inhibit or alleviate bronchial spasm depends on various factors such as the size, type and age of the animal to be treated, the particular triazolopyridazine or pharmacologically acceptable salt employed, the route and frequency of administration, the severity of spasm if any and the causative agent involved, and the time of administration. In particular cases, the dosage to be administered can be ascertained by conventional range finding techniques, for example, by observing the bronchodilator activity produced at different dosage rates. Good results can be obtained when the compound is administered at dosage rates from 1 to 3, to 10 to 50 milligrams of substituted triazolopyridazine compound per kilogram of animal body weight.It is generally desirable to administer individual dosages at the lowest amount which provides the desired protection from bronchial spasm consonant with a convenient dosing schedule. Dosage units adaptable to oral administration such as tablets, capsules, lozenges, elixirs, syrups and the like are preferred and the active triazolopyridazine compound can be formulated in conventional timed release capsule or tablet formulations. Some of the compounds can produce audiogenic convulsant side effects at dosages which, though much higher than the effective dose for bronchodilation, are still below a toxic dosage. Bronchodilator activity can be obtained at high, but non toxic dosages at which additional factors could promote undesirable convulsant side effects, by eliminating other factors contributing to audiogenic convulsions. However, it is preferable to employ the compounds at effective dosages substantially below the audiogenic convulsant dosage, e.g. at one third, to one fifth, one tenth or less of the audiogenic convulsant dosage. The audiogenic convulsant dosage, dosage producing audiogenic convulsions can be determined in known procedures, as described for example in U.S Patent 4,136,182. In practicing the method of the invention, the active ingredient is preferably incorporated in a composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and from about 5 to about 90 percent by weight of the substituted triazolopyridazine compound or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. The term pharmaceutical carrier1 refers to known pharmaceutical excipients useful in formulating pharmacologically active compounds for internal administration to animals, and which are substantially non toxic and non sensitizing under conditions of use.The compositions can be prepared by known techniques for the preparation of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, suppositories, elixirs, syrups, emulsions, dispersions, wettable and effervescent powders, sterile injectable compositions, and can contain suitable excipients known to be useful in the preparation of the particular type of composition desired. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and formulation techniques are found in standard texts, such as Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania. As employed herein, the phrase pharmacologically acceptable salt refers to salts of the substituted triazolopyridazines, the anions of which are relatively nontoxic and innocuous to mammals at dosages consistent with good biological activity so that side effects ascribable to the anions do not vitiate the beneficial effects of the triazolopyridazine compounds. Suitable pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared by conventional procedures such as dissolving the free base compound in an inert organic solvent such as ether and treating the resulting solution with an excess ether solution of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, or hydrobromic acid. For the sake of brevity, such compounds will be hereinafter referred to simply as triazolopyridazines .

See Konzett and Rossler Arch. f.Exp. Path. u. Pharmakol. 195 71 74 1940 Rosenthale and Dervinis, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 172 9194 1968 .In this procedure an anesthetized guinea pig is artificially respired with a fixed volume of air. The volume of air is selected to slightly exceed the capacity of the guinea pig s lungs, and the excess air or overflow is measured. Test compounds are evaluated by administering a test compound intravenously 2 minutes prior to administration of an agonist compound histamine, serotonin or acetylcholine following 3 previous agonist doses resulting in relatively uniform 10 percent bronchoconstriction.When the bronchospasm resulting from administration of the agonist compound occurs, the animal s lungs can receive less air, and hence the overflow is measurably increased. When a test compound blocks the bronchoconstriction induced by administration of the agonist compound, the results can be expressed quantitatively as a percent blockade. This is calculated by dividing the overflow agonist response measured after administration of the test compound by the average of the 3 preceding agonist responses, multiplying by 100 and subtracting this value from 100 percent. The results can also be expressed in comparison to a known bronchodilator, such as aminophylline. In such procedure, comparative results are expressed as percent aminophylline , calculated by expressing the percentage blockade produced by a test compound as a percentage of the average percent blockade produced by dosages of aminophylline administered to the same test animal employed for the test compound with the aminophylline observations preceding and following the evaluation of the test compound in that animal. In representative operations with triazolopyridazine compounds of the invention, administered intravenously at a dosage rate of 3 milligrams of test compound per kilogram of animal body weight except as otherwise indicated and using aminophylline at a dosage rate of 10 milligrams per kilogram for comparison and histamine as the agonist, representative compounds gave excellent results in terms of percent blockade of histamine and percent of aminophylline. 7,8 Dimethyl 6 pyrrolidino s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine, administered as an aqueous solution was found to give a 65 percent blockade of histamine, amounting to 67 percent of aminophylline activity. In similar operations, the compound 6 pyrrol idino 7,8 tetramethylene s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine and the compound 6 morpholino 7 , 8 tetramethylene s tri azolo 4,3 b pyridazine gave 100 and 75 percent blockade of histamine, respectively, amounting to 105 and 113 percent of aminophylline activity. 3,7 Dimethyl 6 morpholino s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine, 6 N methyl piperazino 7 methyl s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine, and 3, 7 dimethyl 6 piperidino s triazolo 4, 3 b pyridazine gave average percent blockades of 61, 39 and 48 percent, respectively.Example 58 Audiogenic Convulsive Side Effects Certain xanthine compounds, such as the known bronchodilator aminophylline, have central nervous system stimulant side effects which are difficult to detect in animal models which are satisfactory for evaluating other compounds. The interaction of sound with the convulsive threshold of drugs is a known phenomenon which can be used to evaluate such side effects. See, for example, Schlesinger et al., Life Science 4, 2345 2351 1965 , 7, 437 447 1968 and 9 I 721 729 1970 Buckholtz, Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 3, 65 68 1975 and U.S. Patent 4,136,182. In a procedure for pharmacological evaluation, the lowering of the convulsive threshold, or the lowering of the LD50, by sound can be studied in mice. In the test operations, mice are administered a test compound by intraperitoneal injection at various dosages, and the number of mice showing tonic convulsions and the number of fatalities occurring within 30 minutes is recorded. The ED50 for tonic convulsions, and the 30 minute LD50 are then determined. These operations are carried out in standard laboratory cages with mice that have become acclimated to the laboratory. The surviving mice are then also exposed to sound about 30 minutes after dosing. The sound exposure is carried out by placing the mice in a sound insulated cage with a bell which emits 120 decibels of sound, and activating the bell for two minutes. The number of tonic convulsions and fatalities are then recorded to determine the ED50 and LD50 in the presence of the sound challenge. In a series of similar experiments, the ratio of the 30 minute LD50 without sound to the sound induced Lid 50 for aminophylline, theophylline and caffeine has been found to be greater than 3 for all three compounds, while strychnine exhibited no significant change in toxicity with sound. U.S.Patent 4,136,182. Various triazolopyridazine compounds have been found to exhibit increased toxicity and lowered convulsive thresholds in such procedures, similar to aminophylline. Other triazolopyridazines which have bronchodilator activity exhibit much less toxic potential for audiogenic seizures. For example, the ratio of LD50 without sound to Lid 50 with sound for 6 morpholino 7,8 tetramethylene s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine was found to be 3.8 while the ratio for 6 morpholino 3 methyl 7 , 8 tetramethylene s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine was found to be about 1.18.Surprisingly, some triazolopyridazines have been found to exhibit a significant lowering of audiogenic convulsive threshold without an associated increase in sound induced deaths, as indicated by a low ED50 for audiogenic tonic convulsions in comparison to the LD50 with sound. The compound 6 morpholino 7 methyl s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine exhibits desirable bronchodilator activity and its sound in duced LD50 of 280 mg kg is not greatly below its 30 minute LD50 of 327 mg kg. However, its ED50 for audiogenic tonic convulsions is only 45 mg kg.6 Morpholino 3,7 dimethyl s triazolo 4,3 b pyridazine in contrast has been found to exhibit much less reduction in convulsive threshold, with an LDso of 228, LD50 with sound of 148, and an audiogenic convulsion End 50 of 135 mg kg. The following table illustrates the bronchodilator activity of representative compounds of the invention and their acute toxicity and audiogenic convulsive properties.

Untreated animals collapse when exposed to the histamine aerosol. In these operations, the animals were observed, and an ED50 was calculated as the dosage at which fifty percent of the animals displayed a collapse time greater than the mean collapse time plus two standard deviation units observed with control animals treated with the injection vehicle alone.
