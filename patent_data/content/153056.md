# Gas turbine installation with start up system.

## Abstract
The temperature of air entering compressor 12 is sensed electrically by a sensor 40 to produce a signal which is con verted by sealing amplifiers 64, 66 into a signal indicative of desired fuel air pressure differential. Actual fuel air pressure differential is sensed by a pressure sensor 80 to produce a sig nal which is compared with the sealed temperature signal to control a fuel valve 74 . The control system may be used only during start up in which case when ignition is detected by sen sor 102 control of fuel valve 74 may be switched to a gov ernor 104 .
