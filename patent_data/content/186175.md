# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE HAVING IMPROVED REDUNDANT STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A memory device having a redundant array of memory cells which operates stably without a leakage current and unnecessary power consumption is disclosed. The memory device has an array of memory cells which are divided into a plurality of sections. The section or sections having at least one of defective memory cells are inhibited from being accessed. A branch power supply line is provided for each section and adapted to be connected to a trunk power supply line, and the branch power supply line for the section including defective memory cell is electrically isolated from the trunk power supply line.
