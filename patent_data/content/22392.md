## Description
The present invention relates to a drum brake assembly of the type comprising a brake spider, on which is mounted a pair of brake shoes, pivotably mounted on one of its ends and actuated by a rotatable cam, disposed between the opposite brake shoe ends. The cam rotation cause a pivoting movement of each shoe around its respective anchor pin, moving them away from the brake assembly center, to force them into engagement with the internal friction face of a brake drum. The shoes employed in this type of brake are fabricated, or cast, with two webs. In the end of each shoe, actuated by a cam, there is a cam follower roller. lhe opposite end of said shoe is mounted on an anchor pin. There are two anchor pins and two rollers, one of each for each shoe. A description of the brake, specially in respect to the anchor pins and shoes, including its mounting and function, is disclosed in the BrazilianPatent Application No PT 7805449. In the present state of the art, and as indicated above, a cam follower roller is provided in the end of each shoe which is actuated by the cam. The function of this roller is to provide an area of contact between the shoe and cam greater than the small area provided by the shoe web, or depending on conditions, by the two brake shoe webs. Another function of the roller is to facilitate and smooth the action of the cam when the latter, in a rotational movement, displaces the shoes from their released position, to force them into engagement with the friction face of the brake drum. The rollers are generally made as one solid cylindrical part, having smaller diameters in the two ends which fit into semi circular apertures that are provided in the ends of the webs of the shoes, while the central portion, with a larger diameter, is located between the two webs.The rollers are fastened to the shoes by means which are well known to those skilled in the art. In order to decelerate or stop the vehicle, the shoes, as are forced outward by means of the cam to engage with the internal face of the brake drum. After having obtained the desired braking effect, the driver of the vehicle releases tho brakes. The cam, that in rotational movement moves the shoes away from their released position, now rotates in the opposite direction, and the shoes can return to their released position, biaised by a spring fastened between the two shoes, to force them in constant contact with the cam by means of the rollers. This spring, called shoe return spring, can be fixed to the shoes by different niethods well known to those skilled in the art.One of these methods is d pin located between the two webs of each shoe, to which the spring is engaged by means of a substantially semi circular, hook formed on each extremity of the spring. Both rollers and spring present certain disadvantages, well known to those skilled in the art. he greatest difficulty with the rollers is that, due to the exposure of the contact area between the roller and the shoe webs to a atmospheric influence as well as accumulation of contaminants in the same area, they size in their seats in the extremities of the shoe webs.Consequently , the rollers will not rotate, and the cam, in its rotational movement, will rub against a fixed surface causing wear both on the roller and on the excentric surface of the cam, thus adversely affecting the functional movements of the brake. The difficulty with the spring is quite clear in the configuration of the brake described in the Brazilian Patent Application NO 7805449. The spring, as mentioned above, has in each extremity a hook essentially semicircular to be fixed to the shoes, and it can only be removed with aid of special tools. To this end, the invention proposes a drum brake assembly of the type comprising a pair of brake shoes pivotally mounted on a brake spider by one of their ends, and a rotating cam actuator disposed between the other ends of said brake shoes to cause a pivoting movement of each shoe around its respective anchor pin, each of said shoe comprising two parallel webs having apertures in said other ends to slidably engage with a cam follower roller assembly characterized in that said roller assembly comprises a pin and a body rotatably and slidably mounted on said pin, wherein said aperture consists of a radial section and two parallel flats, to slidably engage with a radial section and two parallel flats of said roller pin. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a front view of a drum brake assembly made pursuant to the teachings of the present invention Figure 2 is a view of one end of the shoe showing the aperture to fit a roller pin Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line A A of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a view of the end of the shoe with the roller in place Figure 5 is a view of the end ot the shoe showing a second embodiment of the aperture with the roller in place Figure 6 is a view of the return spring showing the new form of fastening hook on one end and Figure 7 is a view of the end of the shoe showing a third embodiment of the aperture with the roller in place. Referring now to the drawings a cam actuated drum brake assembly is indicated by the numeral 10. Assembly tOJ,is supported by brake spider 12 , which is rigidly fastened to a vehicle axle flange not shown . Brake assembly 10 includes a pair of brake shoes 14 , each of which comprises two parallel shoe webs 38 . Each brake shoe is slidably mounted, by one end, on an anchor pin 16 ,which in turn is mounted in brake spider 12 . Between the extremities of the brake shoes 14 , opposite to the anchor pins 16 , a cam 18 , is located with a rotational movement, actuated by means not shown but well known to those skilled in the art. Each brake shoe 14 is provided with a roller assembly 20 , consisting of one pin 22 , and one roller body 24 , which functions as a follower of cam 18 . When brake 10 is applied, cam 18 , rotates to move the shoes outward by means of rollers 20 . The shoes pivot through anchor pins 16 . This outward displacement of brake shoes 14 , forces brake linings 26 into engagement with the internal face of the brake drum not shown , fastened to the wheel of the vehicle. When brake 10 is released, the brake shoes 14 and brake lining 26 fastened to the brake shoes, are moved away from the internal face of the brake drum by action of return spring 28 , held between the webs of the pair of shoes by means of two pins 30 , and hooks 32 and 34 . In the extremities 36 adjacent to cam 18 , each web 38 presents a U shaped aperture 40 , which includes a radial section 42 and two flats parallel to each other and intersecting with the radius of said radial section 42 . Roller pins 22 , in turn, have on both ends two parallel flats 46 , to engage with parallel flats 44 of apertures 40 in the webs 38 , of brake shoes 14 , while the radial section 48 on both ends of roller pins 22 is engaged with radial section 42 of apertures 40 in the webs 38 of brake shoe 14 . The roller bodies 24 are mounted rotatably and slidably on pins 22 and rollers assemblies 20 are mounted slidably in the apertures 40 by means of pins 22 . The tension of spring 28 holds the roller assemblies 20 in contact with cam 18 , and there is no necessety of any other means to hold said assemblies in place in relation to shoe 14. Spring 28 presents on both ends semi circular hooks 32 . One of the hook ends 32 has an extension 34 of suitable form to enable removal and mounting of spring 28 by hand, without the aid of any tools. Figure 5 shows another configuration of aperture to fit the roller. Aperture 54 includes a radial section 56 and two flats 60 and 52 , parallel to each other. Flat 60 intersects with the radius of radial section 56 , while flat 52 is tangent to the radius of the. radial section 56 . For this configuration, the roller pin 50 presents in each end only one flat 62 , located in the same geometrical. Figure 7 presents another configuration of aperture to fit the roller, being a variation of the aperture shown in Figure 5. Here the aperture 54 includes a radial section 56 and a plane 60 . Plane 60 intersects with the radius of the radial section 56 . This configuration accepts the same roller pin 50 as described with reference to Figure 5. Many modifications and or variations of the present invention are possible by those skilled in the art and it is intended that these modifications and or variations he included within the scope of the appended claims.
