# Apparatus for and a method of transferring liquid.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transferring liquid between regions of a first and a second pressure comprising a vessel, a dividing member in the vessel, the vessel and the dividing member being relatively movable to divide the vessel into separate variable volume chambers, a first pair of valves, one of which controls passage of liquid between a first of said chambers and said region of a first pressure, the other of which controls passage of liquid between a second of said chambers and said region of a first pressure, a second pair of valves, one of which controls passage of liquid between said first chamber and said region of a second pressure, the other of which controls passage of liquid between said second chamber and said region of a second pressure, operating means repeatedly to perform the following cycle of operations close the valves of one of said pairs and open the valves of the other of said pairs, then move the dividing member to cause the volume of said first chamber to increase and the volume of said second chamber to decrease, then close the valves of the other of said pairs and open the valves of said one pair, and then move the dividing member to cause the volume of said first chamber to decrease and the volume of said second chamber to increase.
