# Ribbon cartridge.

## Abstract
A ribbon cartridge for use in impact printers, typewriters or the like in which a supply spool 12 and a take up spool 32 are enclosed in a housing with the center of each spool being supported for rotation and for floating movement along a guide path 40 . A fixed center drive capstan 36 imparts surface movement to the take up spool 32 which in turn imparts surface movement to the supply spool 12 . A spring 42 urges the surfaces of the spools together and the take up spool against the drive capstan to effect the serial drive train.
