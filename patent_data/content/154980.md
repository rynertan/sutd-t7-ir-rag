# Negative working light sensitive lithographic plate requiring no dampening solution and plate making process.

## Abstract
A negative working light sensitive lithographic plate re quiring no dampening solution and a plate making process are described. The negative working light sensitive litho graphic plate comprises a support and, in sequence, on said support, A a light sensitive layer containing 1 an o quinonediazide compound and 2 a coupling component which causes a diazo coupling reaction under a basic envi ronment, and B a silicone rubber layer. The plate making process comprises imagewise exposing the negative work ing light sensitive lithographic plate and developing said exposed plate to obtain a lithographic plate requiring no dampening solution, whereby a step of processing with base is carried out after imagewise exposure.
