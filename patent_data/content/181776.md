# A float valve mechanism.

## Abstract
A float valve mechanism comprising a housing 13 defining a closed chamber 14 having an inlet port 12 and an outlet port 22 . The chamber 14 is closed by a cap 17 threaded on to it. The valve head 32 has a conical surface 34 engaging a conical valve seat 23 and a skirt portion 35 having a slightly smaller diameter than the outlet port 22 so that water flowing through the outlet is throttled as the valve nears its closed position. The valve head 32 can be formed separately, of rubber like material, and snap fitted on the valve stem 29 .
