# HYDROCRACKING CATALYST WITH REDUCED ZEOLITE CONTENT

## Abstract
A catalyst composition composed of a porous, inorganic refractory oxide in intimate combination with between about 40 weight percent and about 70 weight percent of a crystalline aluminosilicate Y zeolite. The Y zeolite contains ion exchanged Group VIII noble metal cations and preferably has a silica to alumina mole ratio above about 6.0. Such a catalyst containing the recited amount of zeolite has been found to possess higher than expected activity when used to hydrocrack feed stocks in an ammonia deficient atmosphere and to retain activ ity for hydrocracking in ammonia deficient atmospheres after regeneration. The most preferred Y zeolite for use in the cata lyst has a siiica to alumina mole ratio between about 6.1 and about 7.0 and is prepared by contacting an ammonium exchanged Y zeolite with an aqueous solution of ammonium hexafluorosilicate.
