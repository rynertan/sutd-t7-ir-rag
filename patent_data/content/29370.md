## Abstract
The thermogelation temperature of protein in a solu tion having a pH above the isoelectric point of the protein can be lowered within the range of the thermogelation temperature of egg albumen and an increase of stability of the protein in a solution having a pH below the isoelectric point of the protein by a process comprising cooling an ungelled heated protein containing alkaline solution having a total protein content of less than about 20 wherein the pH of the solution is within the range of from about 7.5 to about 10 and the temperature is within the range of from about 50 C. up to the gelation temperature of the protein to a temperature sufficiently low and within a sufficient time after the solution reaches its maximum temperature level to prevent any substantial further change in the protein struc ture or gelation.
