## Description
MIRROR WITH HOLSTERBackground of the Invention This invention relates to mirrors and more particularly, to a novel and highly effective magnifying mirror that is portable and lighted and that can be held in the hand or supported on a horizontal surface or in a wall mounted holster in a variety of positions for convenient use. Mirrors are among the artifacts of civilization that are used daily by nearly everyone. They are so commonplace that they are taken for granted, but their importance is such that, over the centuries, various inventors have given a great deal of attention to their perfection. There are many styles of conventional mirrors having various useful features such as portability, magnifying capability, and lights. All conventional mirrors, however, have certain drawbacks. For example, many portable mirrors lack a handle altogether, or, if they have one, it is rigidly connected to the mirror or capable of such limited articulation as to confer no special benefit. Many magnifying mirrors are of limited usefulness under conditions of dim ambient light. Many lighted mirrors, while portable in the sense that they can be carried, for example in a suitcase, must be plugged into house current in order to light up, so that the lighting feature is not always available. It is believed that no mirror previously developed has a combination of features that make it ideal for use at home as in a bedroom or bathroom , in the office, and during travel, regardless of ambient lighting conditions or availability of house current. It is believed moreover that no such mirror has a combination of features such that it can readily be held in the hand or supported on a horizontal surface or in a wall mounted holster in a variety of positions for convenient use.

The mirror 10 comprises a housing 14 and a reflector 16 mounted on the housing 14. Illuminating means 18 is mounted adjacent to the reflector 16 for illuminating a subject positioned before the reflector 16.Circuit means 20, shown for example in Figs. 7 and 16, is connected to the illuminating means 18 for actuating the illuminating means 18. A handle 22 is provided, together with pivot means 24 pivotally connecting the handle 22 to the housing 14. Detent means 26 selectively retains the handle 22 in any of a plaualivy of different angular detent positions with respect to the reflector 16. The housing means 14 comprises a hollow plastic casing forked by parts 28 and 30 which are united by a sonic weld 32. The reflector 16 is attached to one side of the casing, as Fig. 6 for example shows, and the illuminating means 18 is mounted within the casing behind the reflector 16. The casing is formed on the side 34 opposite the reflector 16 with a well 36, and the handle 22 can be pivoted so that it is substantially accommodated within the well 36. The reflector 16 is concave, whereby the mirror 10 produces a magnified image. The illuminating means 18 comprises two lamps 38 respectively positioned adjacent to opposite edges of the reflector 16. The pivot means 24 comprises a pair of hollow bearings 40, and the circuit means 20 comprises separate branches 42 and 44 resspectively extending through the bearings 40 and to the lamps 38. The handle 22 can be pivoted from a first position in the well, as illustrated in Pigs. 14 and 15, to second, third and fourth detent positions which are respectively angularly removed from the first position by substantially 450, 85e and 1800. Fig. 13, for example, illustrates the detent position in which the handle forms an angle of substantially 850 with respect to the position occupied by the handle when it is accommodated within the well as shown in Figs. 14 and 15. Figs. 3, 6, 10 and 11, for example, illustrate the detent position in which the handle is angularly removed from its position in the well by substantially 180. The bracket means 12 is selectively engageable with the mirror 10 for storing the mirror in a position such that it can be used while so stored. Figs. 1 7 illustrate the mirror 10 stored in the bracket means 12, the handle 22 of the mirror 10 being fully opened to a position angularly removed from the well position by 1800. The bracket means 12 comprises a holster 46 which accommodates the handle 22. The bracket means 12 further comprises a wall mount 48 and means 50 for pivotally connecting the holster 46 to the wall mount 48. The circuit means 20 comprises a plug 52 for selectively connecting and disconnecting the circuit 20 adjacent to the handle 22, whereby the illuminating means 18 can be powered by house current with the handle 22 inserted in or removed from the holster 46. The plug 52 is formed with a resilient portion 54 best shown in Figs. 6 and 7 which can be manually squeezed to facilitate the connecting and disconnecting of the circuit means 20. The plug 52 is also formed with stop means 56 in the form of protrusions engageable with the inside and outside of flanges 58 projecting inwardly into an aperture 60 formed in the bottom of the holster 46.Stop means 56 cooperates with the flanges 58 in order to fix the position of the plug 52 longitudinally with respect to the lower openings or aperture 60 in the holster 46. The circuit 20 comprises means 62 Fig. 16 for rectifying and transforming house current, and a second plug 64 for connection to house current. The circuit 20 further comprises a power source such as battery means 66 Fig. 16 mounted in the handle 22, whereby the illuminating means 18 can be actuated independently of house current. The power source 66 is preferably a rechargeable nickelcadmium battery consisting of four cells connected in series.Such a battery delivers about 4.8 volts when fully charged and in normal operation about 4.5 volts at an output of 600 milli amperes. me lamps 38 constituting the illuminating means 30 are connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 16. The rectifier transforser 62 when connected as shown in Fig. 16 also functions as a charger for the battery 66. A switch 68 well shown in Figs. 2, 7 and 16 is adapted to turn both bulbs 38 on or off together while leaving the battery 66 connected to the charger 62 for charging. Access doors 70 Pigs. 2 and 15 facilitate bulb replacerent, and portions 72 on the front side of the mirror are transparent or, preferably, translucent, so that the illuminating means can irradiate a subject positioned before the mirror 10. The features described above provide a mirror having exceptional versatility. The mirror can be positioned in a multitude of ways for easy use. It can be positioned as shown in Fig. 1, for example, in its holster, and it can also be positioned pivoted 1800 about the vertical axis. As shown in Fig. 3, the mirror would then be facing the wall 74 on which the wall support 48 is mounted. To use the mirror, it then needs merely to be pivoted counterclockwise until it faces the user. The pivot 50 between the holster 46 and wall mount 48 enables the mirror to be pivoted clockwise or counterclockwise as seen in Fig. 4 and 5. The mirror can be withdrawn from the holster and held in the hand with the handle 22 fully extended as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The mirror can also be placed on a flat surface such as a dresser or table with the handle 22 retained in an intermediate detent position as shown in Fig. 13. In all of these positions the mirror can be lighted by battery or by house current. The opening 60 in the bottom of the holster 46 makes it possible to plug the circuit 20 into house current while the mirror 10 is accommodated within the holster 46. The plug 52 can be disconnected, the mirror 10 withdrawn from the holster 46, and the plug 52 can then be reconnected with the mirror withdrawn from the holster 46 as shown inFigs. 10 and 11. Thus in all of the positions that can be assumed by the mirror it can be used with the lights 38 on or off. Thus there is provided in accordance with the invention a novel and highly effective magnifying mirror that is portable and lighted and that can be held in the hand or supported on a horizontal surface or in a wall mounted holster in a variety of positions for convenient use. The mirror avoids the problems of conventional mirrors and is easily portable, can be held in the hand or separately supported in a position that can be adjusted for easy use, and can be utilized under conditions of dim ambient light regardless of the availability of house current. Moreover, the mirror is inexpensive to manufacture. Many modifications of the preferred embodiments of the invention disclosed above will readily occur to those skilled in the art. In particular, the dimensions and materials employed can be readily selected and adjusted by those skilled in the art.Accordingly, the invention includes all structures which are within the scope of the appended claims.
