# Thermal ink jet printer.

## Abstract
A thermal ink jet printer utilizes a printhead resistor which has a central conductive region 23 to excite bubble growth and to cause ejection of ink droplets. The existence of the central conductive region causes bubbles to be created which are toroidal in shape and which fragment during collapse, thereby randomly distributing the resultant acoustic shock across the surface of the printhead resistor and minimizing cavitation damage.
