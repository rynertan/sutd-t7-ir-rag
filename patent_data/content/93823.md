# Improvements in the cooking modular equipments for large kitchen plants.

## Abstract
The modular cooking equipment for large kitchens includes transverse supports 7 on which fit duct lengths are suspended according to the coupling sense of the module. The duct lengths can thus be quickly connected through screw unions, according to sequences of mnemonic striker. The duct lengths pref.include a number of parallel pipes 1 5 , which may be flexible, for water and gas supply, and an electric raceway 6 . The pipes and raceway are supported by brackets 8 fixed by screws 9 to the supports Adjacent modules may have upstanding lateral edges, which are riveted together and covered by a hooking profile to form a continuous working surface.

## Description
Inprovements in the cooking modular eouipments for large kitchen tiants. An improvement enables the direct union with suspended net, on continuous cou pling line, of the modular component ducts. Another improvement in coupling of the execution modular pieces permits the continuity of the operation plan, thus obviating the interstice formation. The necessity of allowing the suit the project realization, in the preparation of cooking operating coFpertments for large installations, has led to employ modular components which can be fitted in plane with continuous sequence. The installation thus formed must then be equipped with a total adduction net.Such installations are at present carried out at first by cutting the different ducts according the measures that are required and subsequently by connecting each rodular components. As far as the net of ducts is concerned, the present proceeding requires a long time for preparation and choice of the unions to preset. Noreover, the employ of rigid ducts does not allow margins of tolerance and gives rise to difficulties in the phase of the final connection. Then the positio ning of the pipe net into the ground hampers the pavement cleaning and uglifies the surrounding as well. In addition, the drawing of one component does not allow the prosecution of the work because the duct continuity is interrepted.It can be noted, moreover, that the present proceeding gives rise to the formation of residues in the interstices on the bench plane. Tnis dirty deposition can be partially removed and in any case it turns out to uglify the installation. The .ve...ion permits the solution of the problem concerning the duct net setting by means of the modular component conglobation on proper transversal supports, with fi duct lenghts suspended according the coupling sense so that they can be qui ckj connected through screw unions, according to sequences of rne onic striker. The ducts for water and gas supply have been foreseen in lexnble raterial. The continuity of the bench plane is permitted by a hooking profile which slides or. guides for introduction on the front side and covers the two adherent profiles of the modular components.A form of execution is illustrated, in a merely way, bythe draxvings of Tables 1 and 2, where fig. 1 in the perspective view of the composition system on line, sho wing one modular component coupled with another one that can be noticed in a partial wiev and with fitted hooking profile ensuring the continuity of the operative plane. Sidewise, the cutaway of the envelope can be noted with the supplied battery of conduits. Fig. 2 is the side view of the modular component. Fig. 3 is the perspective view of the two corresponding sets of end parts to be connected, and the transversal supporting piece is show with an interposition component between the lenghts of electric raceway. Fig. 4 is the perspective partial view of the connection device permitting to avoid interstices in the connected modular components.Fig. 5 is the transversal section of the fig. 4 particular.The version employs the set of parallel pipes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and the electric raceway 6 which are supported by tie 7 through hooking brackets 8 fixed by screws 9. This allows to fit the duct assembly in a suspended position and an easy removal for restoration and replacement. Each fluid delivery pipe is fitted with an initial T uion 10 with threaded clutches, in the horizontal part of which a pipe piece is joined having a proper section and a threaded end. The second horizontal part of the T union is the one foreseen for the coupling of the modular components fitted side by side. The vertical T union end is fitted with an interception sphere valve 11.To the already mentioned part of pipe, a fle xible fitting is connected 12 having a thresded end which, by means of two unions 13 and 14, permits to fix to part 15, on one side, and to T union of the side by side fitted modular part, in the other one. The device substantially allows to avoid the times of preparation and choice of cor..ponents during the setting up phase, as. well as to get a tolerance by means of flexible connections 12 and the paveMent cleaning since suspended ducts are foreseen. The employ of the front wainscot, in addition is limiting dirtiness below the covered surface. In an enlargement is required for the operative compar tment, union 14 is coupled with T part 10. By loosening screws 9 of transversal piece 7, the pipe assembly can be disjoined from the device and removed, al lowing in this way to prosecute the cooking work on the remaining modular parts.Through hooking profile 17, both limbs 18 and 19 coupled and fixed by means of a set of rivets 20, can be covered these rivets formtwo guides for the introduction and horizontal slide of profile 17 mentioned above.The continuity of the operative plane for the modular components is thus possible, obviating interstices with filth deposits. The execution modulus employs a work plane 21, which can be equipped in different ways, and a control board 22 fitted with lighting push buttons 23. Temperature check instrument 24 is foreseen as well as two knobs 25 and 2 with square base and rounded corners. One of these knobs controls a gas cock, and the other knvob a sphere cock for the water delivery. 7 .wtherncre, a feeding cock 27 is foreseen with flexible hose for coupling, a front panel 28 fixed by means of screw and an underlying wainscot 16 covering and protecting the delivery pepes, a projecting side 29 in the front part containing all above control devices. In addition, an underlying side panel 30 with screws and a lower wainscot 31. On the device back side, a cowl conveying the combustion product 32 covers the smoke discharging stack, with monted wind protection device 33. In particular, wainscot 16 foresees a convex recess 34 which facilitates the entrance of the primary air required by the gas burners fitted inside the cooking device, through grate 35 positioned on the bottom of the front panel 29. The above mentioned control and check instruments are foreseen on a wall 22 with a 550 sloping for guaranteeing a protection of these devices and to falilitate cleaning and maintenance.The projecting of the modular oomponent permits also to the operator an easy approach to the work plane.
