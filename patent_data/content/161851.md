# Tables for billiards, snooker and pool.

## Abstract
A billiard table 10 having a playing surface 15, a plurality of pockets 13 at the edge of the playing surface and cushions 14 extending along the edge of the playing surface and be tween said pockets 13. A reversible electric motor 18 coupled to a drive wheel 19 is provided and said drive wheel frictionally engages the underside of the playing surface 15 to effect rota tion of the playing surface about its central vertical axis. The rotation of the playing surface enables the players of the game to play from only one area at the edge of the table and therefore little space is required around the remainder of the periphery of the table 10. A sloping gully 21 extending under the pockets returns the balls to a collecting box 21a.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A table comprising a table top having a playing surface, a plurality of pockets spaced along the edge of the playing surface, a plurality of cushions extending along the periphery of the playing surface between the pockets and means whereby the table top can be rotated about its central vertical axis. 2. A table as claimed in claim 1 wherein the playing surface is hexagonal and six pockets are provided, one at each corner of the playing surface. 3. A table as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the table top has a central vertically downwardly extending shaft and electrical drive means are provided to produce a rotation of the table top about said shaft. 4. A table top as claimed in claim 3 wherein said electrical drive means comprises a reversible electric motor coupled to a drive wheel which frictionally engages the underside of said table top. 5. A table as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the electrical drive means is controlled by a switch device having two recessed switch buttons selectively operable to cause the motor to rotate the table top in either direction. 6. A table as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the table top is mounted on a rigid supporting frame. 7. A table as claimed in claim 6 wherein a plurality of runners are provided between the table top and the supporting frame to facilitate rotation of the table. 8. A table as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein a sloping gully extends beneath the pockets to a common collecting box or tray.

## Description
TABLES FOR BILLIARDS, SNOOKER AND POOL This invention relates to tables of the kind used for playing billiards, snooker, pool and similar games played with billiard balls. It is well known that tables of the kind referred to not only occupy a large space but also require a similarly large space about the periphery of the table in order to allow the participants to play their shots correctly. There is not always enough space, therefore, to install billiard tables where they are desired and persons are thus hindered from learning the techniques involved in billiards type games. According to the invention, there is provided a table comprising a table top having a playing surface, a plurality of pockets disposed at the edges of the playing surface, a plurality of cushions extending along the periphery of the playing surface between the pockets, and means whereby the table top can be rotated about its central vertical axis. It is a preferred feature of the invention that the playing surface is hexagonal and six pockets are provided, one at each corner of the playing surface. According to another preferred feature of the invention the table top has a central vertically downwardly extending shaft and electrical drive means are provided to rotate the table top about said shaft. Preferably the table top is mounted on a rigid supporting frame. It is also preferred that a plurality of runners are provided between the table top and the supporting frame to facilitate rotation of the table. It is another preferred feature of the invention that a sloping gully extends beneath the pockets for conveying balls from the pockets to a central collecting area. One embodiment of the invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a table according to the invention, and Figure 2 is a part sectional side view of the table shown in Figure 1. Referring to the drawings, the billiard table comprises a table top 10 beneath which is a rigid support section 11 securely mounted on legs 12.The table top 10 comprises a baize covered hexagonal piece of slate providing a hexagonal playing surface 15, which surface is flat and level, and a raised wooden surround lOa of circular outline the edges of which bounding the hexagonal playing surface have cushions 14 secured to them. At each of the six corners of the playing surface is a pocket 13. The cushions 14 and pockets 13 are constructed in a similar manner to those of conventional billiard tables. A circular gully 21 secured to the support section extends under all the pockets and slopes down to a collecting box or tray 21a adjacent a playing area 16 from a point diametrically opposite area 16. A short vertical shaft 23 has a flange at its upper end secured to the underside of the table top and extends into, and is rotatable with respect to, the support section 11. The shaft 23 is coaxial with the central vertical axis of the table top and the lower end of the shaft and said flange rest in a step bearing 26 carried by the support section 11. A reversible electric motor 18 is secured to section 11 and is connected to a drive wheel 19 which frictionally engages in the underside of the table top 10 at 20 so that rotation of the motor effects rotation of the table top in a chosen direction about the shaft 23. The motor 18 is controlled by control box 24 disposed on the floor beneath the edge of the table and having a forward drive orifice 32 connected to the motor by a flex 28 and a reverse drive orifice 33 connected to the motor by a flex 29. The control box enables the players to select the direction and extent of rotational movement of the table top as insertion of the end of a cue into one of said orifices operates a switch button causing the motor and hence the table top 10 to rotate in a particular direction. A plurality of runners, e.g. rollers, are provided between the table top and the support section and ensure the smoothness of rotation of the table top although it will be appreciated that the rotational speed of the table top must not be great enough to cause the billiard balls to move under centrifugal force. It will be appreciated that the rotation of the table top 10 enables the players of the game, therefore, to play from only one area at one side of the table, and, where the available space is restricted, the table is arranged so that the collecting box is adjacent where the players are to stand. Because little room is needed around much of the periphery of the table, spectators can stand close to the table without incommoding the players. Rotation of the table top could also be effected by the provision of two oppositely wired motors and drive wheels, the flex 28 connected to one end and the flex 29 to the other. For use of the table, say, where there is no electricity supply, the table may be arranged to be rotated by hand pressure.
