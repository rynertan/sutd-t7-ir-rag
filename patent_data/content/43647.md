# Energy conversion and storage process.

## Abstract
An energy conversion process for converting ther mal energy into stored electrochemical energy and then into electrical energy comprising heating a first FeCl₂ containing electrolyte melt to produce gaseous FeCl₃ and a reductant product in a first chemical reaction, these reaction products being separated, cooled, option ally stored, and combined in a second FeCl₂ containing electrolyte melt to cause a reaction to take place which is the reverse of said first reaction, thereby regenerating said first melt and producing heat and electrical energy.
