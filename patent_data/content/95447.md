# Device for supporting rolls of adhesive paper in roller type clothes brushes.

## Abstract
The device comprises at least one pair of support and rotation elements 4 for the roll 2 of a shape and size such as to allow them to be inscribed in a circumference of a diameter less than the inside diameter of the roll 2 , and a pair of extremity members 5a 5b , spaced one away from the other at a distance slightly greater than the length of the roll 2 , the shape of these being appropriate and the size greater than the inside diameter of the roll. A rod shaped part 6 connects, in an integral fashion, one with the other, the support elements 4 and the extremity members 5a 5b . To enable the brush to be grasped manually, a handle 9 is provided adjacent to and integral with one of the said extremity members. The other extremity member has trans versely in it, at least one slit 8 that divides the said member into two parts and enables elastic deformation to take place. A projecting part 10 provided on the end cap of a tubular sheath 3 for the protection of the roll 2 mounted on the device, can engage with the said slit 8 .
