# Aerated drinks machine.

## Abstract
An appliance for making an aerated beverage by intro ducing carbon dioxide under pressure into a bottle 29 partly filled with water, in which a support member 16 is pivotally mounted by a pivot 15 on the casing 10 and carries the shatterproof housing, 24 , which surrounds the bottle, the nozzle 31 , the stopper 27 and the container 18 of pressurized liquid carbon dioxide, so that these all pivot with the support member as a pivotal assembly. Such construc tion can be made relatively inexpensively.
