# Spectrophotometer gas control system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a spectrophotometer which includes a burner adapted for burning a gaseous fuel and for atomizing a sample to be analyzed in a burner compartment, mechanical elements or electrical circuitry serving to periodically pass a beam of light through the burner compartment, a detector, electrical circuitry for energizing the detector during the period of absence of the beam of light through the burner compartment, said detector being adapted when energized to produce an electronic signal representative of the presence of a flame in the burner compartment and control elements responsive to the electronic signal for controlling the feeding of fuel to the burner.
