# Flexible tine harrow for the preparation of seed beds.

## Abstract
In a flexible tine harrow for the preparation of seed beds and comprising a plurality of individual harrow sections 4 , each of these sections has an intermediate frame 9 which is supported by earth crumbling drums 10 in front of and behind the harrow section and is towingly connected with the main frame 1 both through a link connection 13 at the front end of the intermediate frame and through a telescopic stay 14 biased to extension and arranged above the harrow sec tion 4 . The directions of the pull and push forces exerted through the link connection and the stay intersect at a point 19 on a level with the shares of the harrow tines 5 , and the forces themselves may be combined into a horizontal resul tant at said point.
