## Description
REFRIGERANT COMPOSITION This invention relates to a refrigerant composition, namely, a working fluid composition for refrigerators. Heretofore, chlorofluorohydrocarbons, fluorohydrocarbons or mixtures thereof having an azeotropic or like composition have been known as refrigerants.At present, dichlorofluoromethane hereinafter referred to as Flon 12 or chlorodifluoromethane hereinafter referred to as Flon 22 is mainly used as a refrigerant. Recently, there is an increasing demand for development of a refrigerant having improved refrigeration characteristics, particularly an improved performance coefficient. An object of the invention is to provide a refrigerant composition which have an improved performance coefficient. Here, the performance coefficient is indicated in terms of refrigeration capacity compression work . Since refrigeration capacity is quantity of heat per unit time taken away from a material to be cooled and compression work is quantity of work per unit time of the power required for operation of refrigerator, the performance coefficient corresponds to an efficiency of refrigeration. Another object of the invention is to provide a refrigerant composition which contains chlorodifluoromethane, the refrigerant composition being superior to chlorodifluoromethane alone in refrigeration characteristics, particularly performance coefficient. These objects and other features of this invention will become apparent from the following description. We have made intensive research in an attempt to provide a refrigerant composition having an improved performance coefficient and found that combination of chlorodifluoromethane and a member selected from the group consisting of l,l difluoroethane, l chloro l,ldifluoroethane and chlorotetrafluoromethane provides a refrigeration composition which is outstandinly superior to dichlorofluoromethane Flon 12 or chlorodifluoromethane Flon 22 alone in the performance coefficient.The present invention has been accomplished based on this novel finding. Thus, according to this invention the above objects are accomplished by a refrigerant composition comprising chlorodifluoromethane and a member selected from the group,consisting of l,l difluoroethane, l chloro l,l difluoroethane and chlorotetrafluoroethane. Preferred embodiments of this invention include the following compositions. 1 A refrigerant composition comprising chlorodifluoro methane and l,l difluoroethane, particularly comprising about 90 to about 70 wt.Z of chloro difluoromethane and about 10 to about 30 wt.Z of l,l difluoroethane With the proportion of less than 10 wt.Z of l,l difluoroethane, a significant improvement in the performance coefficient is not achieved as compared with that obtainable by a refrigerant comprising Flon 12 orFlon 22 alone. While 1,l difluoroethane is inflammable by itself, it can be made less inflammable when mixed with chlorodifluoromethane, and is noncombustible in the range of content of higher than 70 wt.Z of the latter. Thus, the proportion of 1,1 difluoroethane in the present composition is preferably less than 30 wt.Z. 2 A refrigerant composition comprising chlorodifluoro methane and l chloro l,l difluoroethane, particularly comprising about 95 to about 10 wt.Z of chloro difluoromethane and about 5 to about 90 wt.Z of l chloro l,l difluoroethane With the proportion of less than 10 wt.Z or more than 90 wt.Z of l chloro l,l difluoroethane, a significant improvement in the performance coefficient cannot be obtained as compared with that obtainable by a refrigerant comprising Flon 12 or Flon 22 alone. 3 A refrigerant composition comprising chlorodifluoro methane and chlorotetrafluoroethane, particularly comprising about 95 to about 10 wt.Z of chloro difluoromethane and about 5 to about 90 wt.Z of chlorotetrafluoroethane With the proportion of less than S wt.Z or more than 90 wt.Z of chlorotetrafluoroethane, a significant improvement in the performance coefficient cannot be obtained as compared with that obtainable by a refrigerant comprising Flon 12 or Flon 22 alone. The refrigerant composition of the invention affords a higher refrigeration capacity than when Flon 12 is used singly, and particularly the composition comprising about 90 to about 70 wt.Z of chlorodifluoromethane and about 10 to about 30 wt.Z of l,l difluoroethane or about 95 to about 10 wt.Z of chlorodifluoromethane and about 5 to about 90 wt.Z of l chloro l,ldifluoroethane or chlorotetrafluoroethane affords a significantly higher refrigeration capacity. The refrigerant composition of the invention is suitable as a medium for a refrigeration cycle operated at a relatively higher temperature, for example also for a heat pump, since the composition has a smaller specific heat ratio than Flon 22 and affords a compressed gas of a higher temperature than when Flon 22 is used alone. The refrigerant composition is a non azeotropic composition. In general, with use of a single component or an azeotropic composition, the evaporation temperature in an evaporator is kept constant since the evaporation is conducted at a constant pressure. However, with a non azeotropic composition, the temperature in an evaporator is lower at the inlet and higher at the outlet.The fluid to be cooled, which flows counter to the flow of refrigerant to effect heat exchange therebetween, generate a temperature gradient along the flow thereof even when the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant is kept constant. Namely, the difference of temperature between the refrigerant and the fluid to be cooled becomes smaller as the fluid proceeds. The refrigerant composition according to the invention, which is a nonazeotropic composition, can generate a temperature gradient in the evaporator which is similar to that generated in the fluid to be cooled, thus affording improved refrigeration efficiency, i.e. performance coefficient. The present invention will be described with reference to the following examples and comparison examples.
