## Description
A BUBBLE MEMORY CASSETTE This invention relates to a bubble memory cassette exclusively applicable to a bubble memory cassette forming part of a and is particularly but not portable type bu e memory cassette system. Numerical control devices for controlling machine tools have recently been adapted to employ bubble memories rather than paper tapes as the storage medium. These bubble memories are magnetically driven and therefore require a considerable amount of often expensive equipment to enable the bubble memory element to be used as the storage medium.Such equipment includes peripheral circuitry composed of a driver for driving a coil located within the bubble memory element and for driving a variety of gates, a sense amplifier for reading outputs, a function driver and a timing circuit, as vell as a control circuit for controlling data read and write operations. The system that utilizes the bubble memory medium is therefore provided with 1 a bubble memory cassette which houses solely the bubble memory element, and 2 a cassette adapter which contains the peripheral circuitry and a holder for holding the inserted bubble cassette and for establishing electrical contact with the cassette, the cassette adapter responding to commands from the numerical control device to read information from the bubble memory cassette and to write information into memory.To reduce costs, it is so arranged that a single cassette adapter can be used in common by individual numerical control devices, the adapter being designed so that bubble memory cassettes storing different kinds of numerical control information can be exchanged merely by ejecting one cassette and replacing it by another. The contentional bubble memory cassette, however, accommodates only the bubble memory element. The sense amplifier that reads the data from the bubble memory element is provided within the cassette adapter.Consequently, signals travelling through the connector from the bubble memory element to the sense amplifier in the cassette adapter must traverse a considerable distance. This can lead to a problem in factories that employ machine tools since sources of noise abound in such environments. If the numerical control device is installed in the vicinity of a noise source, the long wires passing through the connector between the bubble memory element and the sense amplifier will tend to intercept the noise, the latter entering the input side of the sense amplifier which operates at a low voltage level. Another problem is encountered when it is desired to increase the storage capacity. by installing a plurality of bubble memory element modules within the bubble memory cassette. Specifically, the greater number of modules increases the number of connecting wires between the bubble memory element and the sense amplifier, thereby necessitating a connector of a large size. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a bubble memory cassette comprising a storage medium comprising a bubble memory element and a sense amplifier operable to read out data when stored in said storage medium, the cassette being suitable for use in a bubble memory cassette apparatus comprising a cassette adapter which is to be interposed between the cassette and a host system, for this purpose the cassette being capable of being physically inserted into and withdrawn from such cassette adapter, which includes control circuitry for use in exchanging information between the bubble memory element and a host system when the cassette is in use. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a bubble memory system comprising a cassette adapter and a bubble memory cassette which accommodates a storage medium comprising a bubble memory element, the cassette being capable of being inserted into and withdrawn from the cassette adapter which is interposed between the bubble memory element and a host system when the bubble memory system is in use, the cassette adapter including a control circuit for use in exchanging information between the bubble memory element and such host system, and there being at least a sense amplifier portion of peripheral circuitry for the bubble memory built in to said cassette. According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a bubble memory cassette comprising a storage medium comprising a bubble memory element and a sense amplifier operable to read out data when stored in said storage medium. An embodiment may be employed to shorten, to as great an extent as possible, the wiring distance between the bubble memory element and the sense amplifier in a portable bubble memory cassette apparatus, thereby to enhance the reliability of the apparatus in an electrically noisy environment. A develqent of the invention may provide a bubble memory cassette for use in a portable bubble memory cassette apparatus, in which there is no increase in the number of connecting wires between the bubble memory cassette and the cassette adapter even when the bubble memory cassette is provided with a plurality of bubble memory element modules. A further developmentof the present invention may provide a bubble memory cassette for use in a portable bubble memory cassette apparatus, in which a plurality of bubble memory element modules provided within a bubble memory cassette can be employed selectively by switching among them through use of a changeover switch provided in the bubble memory cassette. embodiment of Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an illustrative view which is useful in describing a portable cassette memory system employing a bubble memory cassette in accordance with the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a portable cassette adapter and a bubble cassette. Referring first to Fig. 1, numerals lla, llb each denote a cassette type storage medium referred to as a bubble memory cassette hereafter having a bubble memory element. A portable cassette adapter 12 has a casing 12a which accommodates the abovementioned peripheral circuitry and control circuit, and which is formed to include a cassette holder 12b for retaining whichever of the bubble memory cassettes lla, llb has been inserted therein, and for providing electrical connection to the housed peripheral circuitry and control circuit. The casing 12a is small in size and is provided at its top with a handle 12c for easy carrying, so that the entire cassette adapter 12 is portable.Further, an eject lever 12d is provided on the side of the cassette holder, the lever being used to eject a bubble memory cassette which has been inserted into the holder 12b.Numerical control NC devices, serving as host systems, are indicated at numerals 14, 15. The NC devices include a built in memory for storing a part program, as well as receptacles 14a, 15a, respectively, which are installed in the casing to make possible electrical connection between the NC device and the cassette adapter 12 via a cable and plug mentioned below. A programming apparatus 16, for the purpose of writing a part program into the bubble memory cassettes Ila, llb, includes a display section 16a and a keyboard 16b, as well as a receptacle 16c which is installed in the casing to make possible electrical connection between the programming apparatus 16 and the cassette adapter 12 through the cable and plug. The cable, denoted by numeral 17, has one end thereof connected directly to the circuitry housed within the cassette adapter, and has the other end thereÏf connected to a connector 18 which is adapted to be plugged into any of the receptacles 14a, 15a, 16c. Thus, the cable 17 and connector 18 enable an exchange of signals and information between the cassette adapter 12, specifically the peripheral circuitry and control circuit housed within the cassette adapter 12, and either of the NC devices 14, 15 or programming apparatus 16, and permit a part program to be read from or written into either of. the bubble cassettes lia, llb. In operation, assume that the NC device 14 is to execute numerically controlled machining using a part program which has been stored in the bubble memory cassette gila. In this case the bubble memory cassette lla is in 12b serted into the cassette holder of the cassette adapter 12, and the connector 18 is plugged into the receptacle 14a of the NC device 14. This establishes the electrical connection between the bubble memory cassette lla and the portable cassette adapter 12, and between the portable cassette adapter 12 and the NC device 14. Once these connections have been made the part program stored in the bubble cassette lla is transferred to and stored in the memory that is built in the NC device 14. The NC device 14 then executes a numerical control operation on the basis of the part program.Similarly, if the NC device 15 is to execute numerically controlled machining using the part program stored in the bubble memory cassette lla, the connector 18 is plugged into the receptacle 15a to transfer and store the program in the NC device 15 as described above. Further, a numerically controlled machining operation on the basis of a part program stored in the bubble memory cassette lIb can be carried out merely by inserting the bubble memory cassette lib into the cassette holder 12a. To exchange cassettes, the eject lever 12d is depressed to eject the bubble memory cassette, accommodated within the cassette holder 12b, to a position where it can be removed by hand. The operator then withdraws the ejected cassette from the cassette holder 12a and forcibly inserts a new bubble memory cassette into the cassette holder until the cassette is received at the operating position. Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the principal components constituting the portable cassette adapter 12 and a bubble memory cassette, such as the bubble memory cassette gila. Specifically, the portable cassette adapter 12 includes an interface circuit 21 for the connection to the host system, a control circuit 22 for generating a variety of necessary signals and for controlling write signal inputs and the delivery of read signals and the like, a timing circuit 23, a function driver 24, timed by the timing circuit 23, for producing signals that enable signal read and write operations, and a coil driver 25, timed by the timing circuit 23, for generating two sinusoidal signals each having a frequency of 100kHz, the signals differing in phase by 900.A receptacle 26 is provided in the cassette holder 12b of the portable cassette adapter 12. The bubble memory cassette lla is provided with a connector 40 which is brought into electrical connection with the receptacle 26 when the bubble memory cassette lla is inserted into the cassette holder 12b of the portable cassette adapter 12. The bubble memory cassette further includes a bubble memory module 41, and a sense amplifier 42 for reading out the data stored in the bubble memory module 41.The bubble memory module 41 has drive coils 41X, 41Y for converting, into a revolving magnetic field, the two sinusoidal currents, having the phase difference 0f 90J7 . obtained from the coil driver 25. In reading data from the bubble memory module 41 in resl onse to a signal from the function driver 24, the data signal immediately enters the sense amplifier 42 disposed in close proximity to the bubble memory module 41 within the cassette casing which it shares with the module. The sense amplifier 42 delivers the data signal to the portable cassette adapter 12 following amplification of the signal. In a case where a plurality of bubble memory modules are installed within the bubble memory cassette lla, a selector is provided within the sense amplifier 42, the arrangement being such that switching the selector supplies the sense amplifier with a data signal obtained from the desired bubble memory module designated by the selector. Wit such an arrangement, and with the addition of only a small quantity of wiring for driving the selector, the number of output lines from the sense amplifier is the same as when only a single bubble memory module is provided. The sense amplifier is provided within the bubble memory cassette, so that the distance between the sense amplifier and the bubble memory module is nuuch shorter than in a prior art arrangement. As a result, externally generated noise is less likely to enter the sense amplifier input side hence, .data read out proceeds with a higher degree of reliability. In addition, by providing a simple selector, a single sense amplifier suffices even when the bubble memory cassette is provided with a plurality of bubble memory modules. Thus there is no increase in the number of sense amplifier output lines despite the greater number of bubble memory modules. As many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.
