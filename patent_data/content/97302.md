# A method of manufacturing a metal button, a button formed by the method, and an article incorporating such a button.

## Abstract
A metal button is disclosed comprising a button part 1 and a rivet part 6 both formed by cold forming respective pieces cut from a body of raw material. The button part has monolithic body providing a shank portion formed with a cavity 2 to receive the stem of the rivet part and with an enlarged head. In use, the stem of the rivet part 6 is inserted, from one side of a piece of cloth or the like, through a hole in the latter, into the cavity in the body of the button part and is pressed into this cavity to deform the rivet stem and increase the diameter thereof to fit tightly within the cavity in the button part. The button parts and rivet parts of a plurality of such buttons are formed by cold forming respective blanks cut, without scrap being formed, from a body of raw material such as a length of aluminium rod or wire. The simple unitary form of the rivet parts and button parts, and the lack of scrap, makes for economic manufacture.

## Description
Title A method of manufacturing a metal button, a button formed by the method, and an article incorporating such a button Description of Invention THIS INVENTION relotes to the manufacture of buttons, more particularly of metal buttons of the type comprising two parts, one of which, herein termed the button part, in use, serves for engagement in a button hole or the like in, for example, an article of clothing and the other of which, herein termed the rivet part co operates with the button part to secure the latter to the piece of cloth or the like on which it is mounted. A button of this type is herein referred to as being of the type specified The main use of such buttons is in the garment industry, although such buttons may also be used, for example, in mechanical components.Metal buttons of the type specified are conventionally formed from sheet material from which blanks ore eut and which blanks are formed by means of dies at various stages in a manufacturing process in the course of which the various components of the button are progressively fitted together. It is also known to use centrifugal casting and plastics injection moulding techniques, in manufacturing individual components of buttons. Various designs of metal buttons of the type specified are known, incorporaling a plurality of individual components and such a button may consist of as many as six elements. In most known forms of metal button of the type specified, the rivet part is secured to the button part by permanent deformation of the rivet part inside ihe body of the button part. In other cases, the stem of ihe rivet part is made a force fit in the orifice, receiving said stem, in the body of the button. This rivet may be grooved, stratiated or formed with a projection, for the purpose of giving more effectiveness to the grip belween the rivet stern and the body of the button part. In a typical known process of forming a metal button of the type specified using blanks of sheet material formed by means of dies, each component element requires for its formation a respective die and a respective predetermined raw material. This, if the button has five elements, five different dies and five different raw materials of different specifications may be necessary. Furthermore, these component elements must be, assembled in a predetermined or order to obtain finally the two parts, i.e. the body part and the rivet part, which will supplied to a garment manufacturer to be applied to garments. In known buttons of the type which utilize injection moulded plastics parts, security of fixing of the buttons to a garment is limited, since the grasping pressure by which the buttons are attached to the garment, is provided by the plastics. In order to present more clearly the prior art, a short description of the more widely known buttons of the kind specified is given below, with reference to the accompanying Figures 7 to 12. Figure 7 shows a button made of five component parts. The integral button or core has a cap, a cone and a bell, which are assembled as shown.The rivet has a cap on its head. All five parts are from sheet metal, shaped by means of dies. When the button is secured, the tubular rivet is deformed upon entering the cavity of the cone and engaging the bell. Figure 8 shows a button comprising four components, three of them made with dies the rivet, the cone and the anvil. When the button is secured, the rivet deforms upon entering the cone and colliding with the anvil. Figure 9 shows a button of three components, each formed by a different manufacturing process the cap is made of sheet metal formed by means of a die, the cone is of plastics formed by injection moulding and the rivet is a special, cold formed rivet. When the button is secured, the rivet enters under pressure into the orifice of the plastic cone. Figure 10 shows a button of five components, all formed from sheet metal shaped by dies a cap, an anvil, and a cone, forming the button part of the button assembled as shown, and a hook and its cap, forming the rivet .When the button is secured, the hook pierces the cone and its two tips bend as they collide with the anvil. Figure II shows a button of five components, four of which are formed of sheet metal shaped by dies. The button part of the button has a cap, a washer, and a cone the rivet comprises a cold formed primary part and a sheet metal cap. When the button is secured, the stem of the rivet penetrates the cone and deforms upon colliding with the washer the cone has a double neck which hinders pulling of the rivet out of the button part. Figure 12 shows a six component button, which is the same as the button of Figure E, except that it has a holder, which replaces the double neck in the cone. As will have been noted, all these prior art buttons have more than two components and, where a deformable rivet and an anvil are used, the anvil must be made separately, because it must be sufficiently strong to deform the rivet. A cone to form the cavity and support the anvil is usually needed. Sometimes a washer is used instead of an anvil. The rivet has sometimes two pieces, because the nails or hooks which are used need a cap, for aesthetic reasons. It is an object of the present invention, in one of its aspects, to provide a method of manufacturing a button of the kind specified, which is more economical than known methods and yet can yield on effective product of good appearance. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a method of manufacturing metal buttons each comprising a button part and a rivet part, characterised by dividing a body of metallic raw material into a plurality of blanks, without producing, from said body, any scrap material, and forming the button parts and the rivet parts as respective monolithic components by cold forming said blanks into respective said rivet parts or button parts, without necessarily converting any portion of a said blank into scrap material. It is an object of the invention in another of its aspects to provide an improved button of the kind specified, which is economical to manufacture and yet is satisfactory in appearance and in use. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a button comprising a button part and a rivet part, manufactured by the above method according to the invention, characterised in that said button part comprises a monolithic body with a cavity ending in a self contained anvil, and said rivet part, as produced by said cold forming operation, comprises a head and a stem of a diameter such as to fit freely within said cavity and a length such as to engage, by its tip said anvil at the end of said cavity, before said head engages said button part, whereby the button con be secured to a piece of cloth or other sheet material by passing the stem of the rivet part through a hole in the cloth or other sheet material, from one side thereof, into said cavity of the button part disposed on said other side of the piece of cloth or other sheet material, and pressing the rivet into said cavity to cause the tip of the rivet part to engage the said anvil and to cause subsequent deformation of the rivet part in which the stem of the rivet part is increased in diameter to fit tightly within said cavity and the piece of cloth or other sheet material is held between the button part and the head of the rivet part. The invention also comprehends within its scope a piece of cloth or other sheet material, for example incorporated in an article of clothing in combination with a button embodying the invention, the combination having been formed by extending the stem of the rivet part of a button according to the last noted aspect of the invention through a hole in said piece of cloth or other sheet material from one side thereof, into said cavity of the button part disposed on said other side of the piece of cloth or other sheet material, and pressing the rivet into said cavity to cause the tip of the rivet part to engage said anvil and to cause subsequent deformation of the rivet part in which the stem of the rivet part is increased in diameter to fit tightly within said cavity and the piece of cloth or other sheet material is held between the button part and the head of the rivet part. Embodiments of the invention are described below with reference toFigure I to 6 of the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE I is an exploded perspective view, of a button with three components, embodying the invention, FIGURE 2 is an exploded perspective view of a button with two components, embodying the invention, FIGURE 3 is a view in axial section of the button part of the button of Figure 1. FIGURE 4 is a view in axial section of an integral core, forming the button part of the button of Figure 2. FIGURE 5 is a side elevation view of the rivet part of the button ofFigure I and of the button of Figure 2, and FIGURE 6 is a view in axial section showing the button of Figure I applied to a piece of cloth. Referring to Figure I, this shows, to the left, in perspective, and separated from one another, i.e. prior to final fixing to a garment or the like, the button part and the rivet part of a button embodying the invention.Thus, the left portion of Figure I shows the two separate items as they would be supplied to a clothing manufacturer for securing to garments.Figure I shows, to the right, the button separated into its individual components, of which there are only three, namely the monolithic rivet part 6, the monolilhic core I of the button, and a cap 5 which is secured to the core I. Figure 2 shows, in perspective, the two components of another button embodying the invention, namely a monolithic button part I and a mono lithic rivet part 6. For the purposes of the drawings and the description which follows, the button part I of Figure 2 may be regarded as identical with the core I of the button of Figure I, although it will be appreciated that where the button is to carry an insignia, trade name or the like, this will normally be provided on the cap 5 in the embodiment of Figure I but directly on the button part in the embodiment of Figure 2. Figure 4 shows in axial section the monolithic button part I of the button of Figure 2. This button part is cold formed from a section cut from an aluminium wire, or rod and has a shank portion provided with an axially extending cylindrical cavity 2, and an enlarged flot topped circular head 4 of small depth measured axially. The cavity 2, when the button is fitted to a garment, receives the stem of the rivet part. At the end of the shank of the button part I remote from the head 4, the entrance to the cavity 2 is restricted and partially closed by a radially inwardly turned annular lip or flange, or by two radially inwardly projecting protuberences 3 and 31. Figure 3 is a view in axial section of the button psrt of the button ofFigure I, which differs from that of Figure 4 only in that a cap 5 is applied to the core. As noted above, this cap is an additional piece which is only necessary for aesthetic purposes and carries, for example, the clothing menufocturer s logotype or the like, which, in the embodiment of Figures I and 4 may be simply be impressed on the top of the head 4. Figure 5 shows the rivet part 6, cold formed from a section cut from aluminium wire or rod and which has a flat head and a stem intended to fit within the cavity 2 of the button part of Figure 3 or Figure 4. As supplied to the clothing manufacturer, by the stem of the rivet part is of a diameter somewhat less than the entrance to cavity 2 defined by the inwardly turned annular lips of protuberences 3,31, so that the stem is a free fit in said entrance and in the remainder of cavity 2. The stem of the rivet part 6 is also of such a length that the tip of said stem, i.e. the end of stem remote from the rivet head, will, when the stem is inserted in the cavity 2, engage the closed inner end of the cavity, which inner end forms an anvil, before the head of the rivet part 6 engages the free end of the shank of the button part. To apply the button of Figure I or the button of Figure 2 to a piece of cloth, forming, for example, part of a garment, the rivet part 6 and the button part are placed on opposite sides of the cloth with the rivet stem and the cavity 2 in line with, and facing, one another, and the rivet stem is passed through the cloth, for example being driven through the cloth to form a hole in the cloth, or being passed through a hole formed previously in the cloth into the cavity 2 until the tip of the rivet stem engages the anvil formed by the inner end of the cavity 2.During further pressing of the rivet part 6 and the button part together, the stem of the rivet part is progressively deformed so that its diameter increases until it fits tightly within the cavity 2, and by reason of its frictional engagement with the wall of the cavity 2, and by reason of the fact that the expanded tip of the rivet stem is now too large to pass through the restricted entrance to the cavity 2, cannot thereafter be withdrawn from the button part. The pressing of the rivet part 6 into the button part I, with consequent deformation of the rivet stem, is continued until the cloth is clamped between the head of the rivet part 6 and the free end of the shank of the button part. Figure 6 shows the assembled button, with the cloth 7 in between the two components. The process of manufacturing the above described metal button is very simple from an aluminium wire or rod of predetermined diameter, respective lengths are cut off to constitute two pieces or blanks to be coldformed. One of these pieces is cold formed, using appropriate dies, to form the rivet part 6 and the other of these pieces is cold formed, using appropriate dies, to form the core or integral button I. No waste or scrap is formed in the process. In its simplest form, e.g. as shown in Figures 2 and 4, the whole button comprises only two components and only a corresponding number of dies needs to be employed. Furthermore, no scrap or waste moterial is produced and no complicated assembling of components forming the core button part and the rivet is required. Only one raw material, with one specification for the two pieces is necessary. The rivet is in one piece, i.e is monolithic and no cap is needed for the rivet. The other part i.e the button part, is also a one piece, monolithic component, including within its body the anvil. The cone is also self contained. In the embodiment shown inFigure 2, whilst if account is taken of the cap 5, the button part may be regarded as being of two part constrution, the cap 5 is merely a trim or decorative element and is not functionally necessary. Thus the process described with reference to the drawings has, as compared with known processes, the advantage that no scrap or waste material is produced since all of the starting material, i.e. the aluminium wire or rod, is transformed into the final product and the advantage of simplicity, both of the process and of the end product, permits a reduction of approximately 75 in the tools and dies required, since only two pieces are produced. As a consequence appreciable economy in production is obtained as compared with known methods of making metal buttons of the type specified fewer pieces need to be produced, fewer kinds of stock materials need to be stocked, less time need be extended in production of repair parts, there is less wear of equipment and tools, less labour is involved, less weight of products and, as a result, less transportation cost.If the button does not carry a cap, this lowers the cost of manufacture, whilst even if it does carry a cap, the product it is less complicated than prior buttons since only two pieces take part in fixing the cap to the button. Furthemore, since only two monolithic parts are involved in securing the button to a garment or the like, there is less likelihood of the firmness with which the rivet part is held in the button part diminishing in use than with known buttons. The button is preferably made from aluminium, with which a product is obtained which is 100 stainless and more resistant to high temeratures than buttons with a plastics injection moulded core, that is, articles of clothing which carry the buttons embodying the invention can be sumitted to relatively high temperatures without deterioration of the button. Aluminium is also more resistant to wear than plastics, and, indeed the buttons described with reference to Figures I to 6 have been found to be more durable in use than known metal buttons of the type specified.
