## Description
DESCRIPTION DERIVATIVES OF 2 SUBSTITUTED 6 PHENYL 3 2H PYRIDAZINONE, THEIR PRODUCTION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM . The present invention relates to derivatives of 2 substituted 6 phenyl 3 2H pyridazinone to their production and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these derivatives. The etiology of peptic ulcers has not yet been completely elucidated. It is considered that various important factors combine together to cause peptic ulcers.Nowadays, an antacid is used to neutralise the acidity of gastric juices or an anticholinergic drug is used to inhibit the secretion of the gastric juices in order to treat peptic ulcers. However, sufficiently lengthy activity is not available by the former method refer to Avery Jones, J.E. and Lennard Jones, J.E. ClinicalGastroenterology , 2nd. Ed., Blackwell ScientificPublications, Oxford, 1968, Chapter 14. . On the other hand, it is known that the latter method causes side effects involving the parasympathetic nerve system such as the inhibition of movement of the stomach at doses at which the anticholinergic drug is effective refer to Kaye, M.D., Rhodes, J. and Sweetman, P.M., Gut , 9,590 1968 . Compounds having a thioamide group on a pyridazinone ring and their anti peptic ulcer activity are disclosed in our Japanese Patent Applications LayingOpen Nos. 21180 1978 and 118469 1980. These compounds inhibit the secretion of gastric juices, and possess a strong anti ulcer activity because they contain the key 6 phenyl 3 2H pyridazinone grouping. However, problems concerning the length of time over which anti peptic ulcer activity is exhibited and of unfavourable side effects still remain. It has now been discovered that these problems can be overcome by derivatives of 2 substituted 6 phenyl3 2H pyridazinone represented by the qeneral formula I EMI2.1 wherein RÚ. Rê and R independently represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group R4 and R5 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group m is an integer of from 1 to 3 n is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 3 Z represents a CH2 , 0 or S X represents S R6 or N H H7. wherein R6 represents a lower alkyl group and R7 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group or propargyl group and the two carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 of the heterocyclic ring of the formula I to which R4 and R5 are bonded respectively, are joined by either a single or a double carbon carbon bond and acid addition salts thereof with the proviso that when Z represents 0 or S , the carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 are joined by a double bond and n represents an integer of from 1 to 3. The apostrophes on the nitrogen atoms N and N are merely for ease in identifying these nitrogen atoms. The compounds of the invention show a strong anti peptic ulcer activity with fewer unfavourable side effects.A lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group is a group having up to 6,preferably up to 4, more preferably up to 3, carbon atoms. R1 R2 and R3 in the formula I can represent chlorine, methyl or methoxy. Preferably, the group of formula EMI3.1 is a phenyl,4 chlorophenyl,3,4 dichlorophenyl,4 methOxy phenyl,3,4 dimethoxyphenyl,3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl,4 methyl phenyl,5 methylphenyl or 2,4 dimethylphenyl group,Preferably one of R4 and R is a methyl group and the other is hydrogen, or both R4 and R5 represent hydrogen. R6 can be a methyl group and R7 may be a methyl, ethyl or propyl group. The compounds represented by the general formula I can be easily prepared in accordance with the invention in high yield by any process shown in the following ChartsNos. 1 to 3, wherein R8 represents a lower alkyl group Chart No. 1EMI4.1 Chart No. 2EMI5.1 The compounds of the invention are prepared from a compound II having an omega aminoalkyl group on the nitrogen atom at the 2 position of the pyridazinone ring in Chart No. 1, from a compound VI having an omega aminoalkylene oxo alkyl group on the 2 nitrogen atom in Chart No. 2, and from a compound VII having an omega aminoalkylene thioalkyl group on the 2 nitrogen atom in Chart No. 3.These starting compounds can themselves be prepared by using a compound having an omega halogenoalkyl group or an omega phthalimidoalkyl group on the nitrogen atom at the 2 position of the pyridazinone ring as follows The starting compound II wherein Z is CH2is obtained by reaction of the corresponding compound having an omega halogenoalkyl group or an omegaphthalimidoalkyl group with an aqueous ammoniacal solution or with hydrazine hydrate. The compound II can also be prepared by dissolving the corresponding compound having an omega halogenoalkyl group or an omegaphthalimidoalkyl group in an appropriate solvent and passing gaseous ammonia into the thus prepared solution to carry out amination, etc. The starting compounds VI and VII whereinZ is 0 or is S respectively are obtained by reacting a compound having an omega halogeno C1 to C3 alkyl group which means m is 1 to 3 in the general formula I with an equimolar amount or more of an aminoalkyl alcohol or aminoalkylmercaptan aminoalkanethiol in an inert solvent in the presence of metallic sodium, sodium hydroxide, etc. at an elevated temperature or room temperature for a few hours. The isothiourea derivatives of the present invention represented by formulae I A , I C and I E can be prepared by bringing the starting compound II , VI or VII into reaction with a corresponding amount of a compound III as is shown in Charts Nos. 1 to 3.For instance, dimethyl cyanodithioimidocarbonate or dimethyl cyanodithioimidocarbonate can be used as the compound III . In this reaction, a solvent is not always necessary although an inert solvent such as ethanol, acetonitrile or chloroform is suitable. The reaction is carried out at room temperature or under cooling.However, it is possible to effect the reaction under reflux while using a solvent. The derivatives of isothiourea of the invention e.g. the compounds I A , I C and I E , are also important as intermediate compounds for preparing derivatives of guanidine of the invention, e.g.compounds I B , I D and I F , respectively. As is shown in Charts Nos. 1 to 3, the compounds I B , I D and I F are obtained by bringing the respective derivatives of isothiourea, e.g. the compounds I A , I C and I E , and ammonia or a lower alkylamine,R NH 2 wherein R denotes a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl, into reaction in an inert solvent such as ethanol, acetonitrile or benzene at an elevated temperature or at room temperature for a few hours. The group SR in the isothiourea derivatives is substituted by the group NH R7 in the ammonia or the alkylamine. In the case where Z represents CH2 , 0 or S , the compounds I B , I D and I F may be prepared directly from the starting compounds II , VI and VII .In such a case, for instance, a nearly equimolar mixture of a compound II and a derivative of isothiourea IV are brought into reaction in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile, chloroform, etc. at a raised temperature or room temperature for from a few hours to a few days to give the desired compound of the present invention.The compounds of the general formula I can be converted into the appropriate acid addition salts. The pharmacological and toxicological properties of the compounds of the present invention are explained as follows 1. Pharmacoloqical properties Anti peptic ulcer activity of the compounds was evaluated on Shay s ulcer, stress ulcer and aspirininduced ulcer, as well as the effects of the compounds on gastric secretion, by the following methods using rats as experimental animals 1 l Shay s ulcer Two groups of rats of body weight of from 2x10 1 to 2,5x10 1 kg 200 to 250 g , each group consisting of 10 animals, were treated under ether anaesthesia by ligature of the pylorus after 48 hour fasting during which water was taken ad lib. and, just after the operation, an aqueous suspension of one of the compounds of the invention in a 1 solution of carboxymethylcellulose hereinafter referred to as CMC was administered intraduodenally to the rats in one group at a dose of 10 4 kg kg 100 mg kg .The other group control was given an aqueous 1 solution of CMC intraduodenally,After keeping these animals for 18 hours without giving them any food and water, their stomachs were extirpated under ether anaesthesia and the area m2xl0 6 mm2 of the ulcer generated on the forestomach part of the rats was determined under an anatomical microscope. The total area of the ulcers of one group was represented by an ulcer coefficient. The rate of inhibition of the occurrence of ulcers was obtained by calculation according to the following formula Rate of inhibition of the occurrence of ulcers 100 x Ulcer coeff. of control qp Ulcer coeff. of test qp ulcer coeff.of control gp The compounds tested in this experiment and their rate of inhibition of the occurrence of ulcers are shown in Table 1 below. 1 2 Stress ulcer One group of 10 rats of body weight of from 2x10 1 to 2.5x10 Úkg 200 to 250 g after oral administration of an aqueous suspension of the compound of the invention being tested in a 1 CMC solution at a dose of 10 4 kg kg 100 mg kg were kept in stress cages and immersed in water at a temperature of 230C to the depth of their thorax for 20 hours to give a stress of restriction in water. Another group of 10 rats of the same strain a control group were also treated with the same stress, but after administration of an aqueous 1 CMC solution. Just after removing the rats from the water, they were clubbed to death and their stomachs were extirpated. Then about 1.5x10 5m 15 ml of an aqueous 1 formaldehyde solution was injected into each stomach.After maintaining the formaldehyde solution in the stomachs for 10 minutes to enable the solution to contact to the inner stomach wall, each stomach was cut open along the greater curvature to examine the length of erosion in 10 m mm generated on the mucosa of the glandular stomach region under an anatomical microscope. The sum of the length of erosion for rats of one group was represented by the ulcer coefficient. The rate of inhibition of the occurrence of the ulcer by each compound was obtained by the same method as in 1 1 , the results being shown also in Table 1. 1 3 Aspirin induced ulcer One group of 10 rats of body weight of from 2x10 1 to 2.5x10 1 kg 200 to 250 g was subjected to laparotomy under ether anaesthesia, after 24 hour fasting with ad lib. taking water, to have ligature of their pylorus according to Okabe et al., 1974 . Just after the ligature, an aqueous suspension of one of the compounds of the invention in a l o CMC solution was intraduodenally administered to the rats at a dose of 10 4 kg kg 100 mg kg . After closing the abdomen, an aqueous dispersion of aspirin in a 1 CMC solution was orally administered at a dose of 10 4 kg kg 100 mg kg . After 7 hours of the aspirin administration, the stomach was extirpated under ether anaesthesia, and the length in 10 3m mm of erosions generated on the mucosa of the glandular stomach region was measured. The sum of the length of erosion on rats of one group was represented by the ulcer coefficient. The same procedures were carried out on another group of 10 rats of the same strain a control group except that an aqueous 1 cMC solution was administered instead of the aqueous dispersion of one of the compounds of the present invention. The rate of inhibition of the occurrence of ulcers was obtained by calculation as in 1 2 , the results being also shown inTable 1. 1 4 Effects on gastric secretion One group of 10 rats of body weight of from 1.5x10 to 1.8x10 kg 150 to 180g was subjected to ligature of the pylorus after 24 hours fasting, under ether anaesthesia, and one of the compounds of the present invention or the reference compound was administered as a dispersion in an aqueous 1 CMC solution into the duodenum. Only an aqueous 1 CMC solution was administered into the duodenum of a control group of 10 rats. After 7 hours from closing the abdomen, the stomach was extirpated under ether anaesthesia to collect the gastric juice that had accumulated in it.The inhibiting effect of each drug on gastric secretion was calculated by the following formula Inhibiting effect on gastric secretion 100 x A B A wherein Amount of gastric juice of control group A ml Amount of gastric juice of test group B ml The results are also shown in Table 1.
