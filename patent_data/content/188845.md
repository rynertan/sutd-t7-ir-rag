# Insecticidal composition and method for combatting aphids.

## Abstract
The invention provides insecticidal compositions for com batting aphids, which compositions contain an aphid insecti cide in an amount lower than the minimum usual percentage for said insecticide in an aphicidal composition and an alarm pheromone for aphids. The compositions of the invention are less toxic because of the reduced insecticide content but they are not less effective than the insecticidal compositions which do not contain an alarm pheromone.
