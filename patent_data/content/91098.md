# Flexible magnetic disc drive apparatus.

## Abstract
A flexible magnetic disc drive apparatus which compris es a disc clamper assembly 40 which is operated in interlock with a door to hold a flexible magnetic disc 68 between the disc clamper assembly 40 and spindle 64 , a link mechanism 38 for connecting the disc clamper assem bly 40 to the door 80 , wherein the link mechanism 38 comprises a door lever 82 which is rotatably fitted at one end to the housing 54 of the flexible magnetic disc apparatus in the vicinity of the disc clamper assembly 40 , and is connected at the other end to the door 80 and whose intermediate part is provided with a projection 88 , and a clamper hanger 62 which is rotatably fitted at one end to the housing 54 between the door 60 and the projection 88 and is connected at the other end to the clamper hanger 62 , and wherein, when the door 80 is opened, the door lever 82 pushes the clamper hanger 62 upward to lift the disc clamper assembly 40 above the spindle 64 , and, when the door 80 is closed, the clamper hanger 62 is elastically brought downward by the urging force of the plate spring 94 fitted to the door lever 82 to let the disc clamper assembly 40 fall, thereby causing the disc 68 to be held between said clamper hanger 62 and spindle 64 .
