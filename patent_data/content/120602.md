# Assay methods.

## Abstract
A method of performing an assay for an analyte com prises providing a chromatographic medium, preferably in sheet form, forming a reaction mixture containing a labeled reagent present partly in a form which is mobile on the medium and partly in a form which is immobile, the propor tions of the two forms being related to the analyte concentra tion, applying the mixture to a spot on the chromatographic medium, optionally applying a solvent to cause the mobile form of the labelled reagent to migrate from the spot, and measuring the label intensity remaining at the spot. The method provides a convenient way of performing immuno assays, 2 site immunometric assays, and agglutination assays.
