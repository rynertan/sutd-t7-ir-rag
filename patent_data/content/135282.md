## Description
This invention relates to improving the adhesion of aramid, preferably poly p phenylene terephthalamide fiber to polymer matrices in reinforced composite structures. Such improvement is demonstrated by increased interlaminar shear strength. The commercial importance of fiber reinforced composites has long been recognized. Both thermosetting resins such as unsaturated polyester and epoxy resins, and thermoplastic resins such as nylon and polycarbonate are commonly used as matrix material for reinforced composites. Glass, carbon and boron fibers are well known reinforcement materials. While the adhesion between certain reinforcing fibers and matrix polymer is excellent, other combinations require the use of so called coupling agents in order to approach the maximum strength achievable through reinforcement. This technology is highly specialized, and the suitability of any material to improve the adhesion between any particular fiber and any particular matrix is not predictable. For example, certain silanes have been used to couple glass fiber to epoxy resins but silanes are not effective for coupling carbon fibers with phenolics. Further, some coupling agents are unsuitable because of high cost or questionable carcinogenicity. Fiber surface treatments have also been used to enhance adhesion between fiber and matrix. Relatively recently a new high strength aramid fiber, poly p phenylene terephthalamide fiber has come on the market and reinforcement is one of its major end uses. It is widely used as reinforcement in tires, belts and plastics. Many coupling agents were tried with the object of improving the adhesion of this new fiber to epoxy and unsaturated polyester matrices with limited success. In particular, it was highly desirable to improve the interlaminar shear strength of organic polymeric composites reinforced with poly p phenylene terephthalamide fiber. This is discussed in Polymer Composites, January 1983, Vol. 4, No. 1, pp. 26 31. The present invention is directed to a solution of this problem. This invention provides poly p phenylene terephthalamide fiber coated and reacted with a sulfonyl azide of the formula wherein X, Y and Z are selected from the group of hydrogen, carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, and vinyl, with the proviso that at least one but not all of X, Y and Z is hydrogen, in an amount sufficient to improve the adhesion of the aramid fiber to a polymer matrix. Also provided are epoxy and unsaturated polyester composites reinforced with such fiber. A number of useful compounds falling within formula I above are as follows The aforementioned sulfonyl azides are prepared using procedures described in the literature which involve reaction of sulfonyl chlorides with sodium aside. The compounds are not water soluble and are preferably applied from solvents. Thus the compounds may be applied to continuous filaments by dip coating, finish roll applicator or metering and the filaments dried. Heating the coated fiber at temperatures up to about 150 C may be used to hasten drying. In another procedure, staple or short length aramid fiber may be doused with a solution of the compound and then dried. Curing of the coated yarn at elevated temperatures is required to effect the desired reaction with the fiber surface. Curing temperatures from 140 to 200 C and for periods of from 0.5 to 1 hour have been found satisfactory. The compounds may be cured in the drying process. The coating solutions preferably contain about a 5 concentration of the azides but as little as 1 concentration may be used. The percent active ingredient add on is not critical. Between 0.1 and 10 weight percent based on the coated fiber is preferred but even smaller amounts will improve adhesion. One skilled in the art can readily determine the amount sufficient to enhance adhesion. After the fiber is coated, dried and cured, the resin matrix is applied. If desired, the azide coated continuous filaments may be cut to short fibers and blended with unsaturated polyester resin for injection molding and other purposes. The filaments in the composite generally range from 2 to 70 volume percent. The needs of the particular end use application generally dictate the amount, type continuous vs. short fiber and orientation directionality of the fiber to be used. It should be understood that while the greatest benefits in increased adhesion are found with unsaturated polyester and epoxy matrix materials, the coated filaments of the invention also provide improved adhesion to other matrix materials. Polyester resins used with reinforcement to make a variety of products are described more fully in the Modern Plastics Encyclopedia 1980 1981 pp. 59 60. In the examples below, commercially available epoxy resin and unsaturated polyester were used for the matrices. Composites that were prepared for demonstrating the improved adhesion obtained with the coated filaments of the invention were unidirectional filament wound samples. Sodium azide 27.9 g in water approx. 150 ml is added to a stirred solution of 4 carboxybenzene sulfonyl chloride 75.4 g in acetone 600 ml at room temperature. After stirring 0.5 hr the clear solution is diluted to 2 liters with water and chilled. The resultant solid, 4 carboxybenzene sulfonyl azide, is filtered, washed with water, dried in air and then dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorous pentoxide. Yield is 63.4 g 82 , m.p. uncor. 185 186 dec. lit 184 186 Hendrickson and Wolf, J. Org. Chem. 4 Hydroxybenzene sulfonyl azide and 3 carboxy 4 hydroxybenzene sulfonyl azide are made in a similar fashion from known sulfonyl chlorides. 3 Carboxybenzene sulfonyl azide is made according to French Patent 1,455,154. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. A 1000 filament, 1578 dtex 1420 denier , poly p phenylene terephthalamide yarn is coated with a 2 solution solvents, see Table I of each of several designated compounds by running the yarn through a dip tank, through a die of 0.041 cm 0.016 inch diameter to remove excess solution, and drying on the run in an oven. Each yarn sample is then heated under nitrogen under the conditions shown in Table I, first at a lower temperature to assure that all solvent is removed and then at a higher temperature to assure reaction with the fiber surface. Samples of each treated yarn and an untreated yarn for comparative purposes are wound in a rectangular mold and embedded in two different matrix resins. One comprises 100 parts by weight of an isophthalic polyester in styrene monomer, unpromoted Freeman Chemical Corp. Stypol Trade Mark 40 2990 and 2 parts by weight of t butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate Pennwalt, Lupersol Trade Mark PDO, 50 solution as catalyst. The other is an epoxy resin composition comprising 100 parts of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A Epon Trade Mark 826, Shell , 25 parts of 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether Araldite Trade Mark RD 2 Ciba Geigy and 30 parts aromatic diamine curing agent Tonox Trade Mark , Uniroyal . The rectangular mold has two cavities 15.2 cm long x 1.3 cm wide x 1.3 cm deep 6 x 1 2 x 1 2 and resin coated fiber is wound into these cavities. Two cover plates are laid on the cavities and screws are partially tightened to hold the cover plates to the mold. Four shims 0.32 cm 1 8 thick are placed between the mold and the cover plates to give the desired sample thickness. All metal parts were sprayed with mold release before winding for easy disassembly . The complete mold is then placed in a vacuum chamber at room temperature and 63.5 cm 25 inch vacuum for 30 minutes to degas the resin. All screws are tightened. The polyester samples were cured for one hour at 130 C. The epoxy samples were cured for 1.5 hour at 120 C followed by one hour at 175 C. The cured composites are cooled down to ambient temperature. The screws and cover plates of the molds are removed. The composite is cut with a saw to give two unidirectional filament wound samples 15.2 cm long x 1.3 cm wide x 0.32 cm thick 6 x ½ x ⅛ . Fiber volume is 64 4 . Thickness varies between 2.92 mm 115 x 10 ³ inch to 3.25 mm 128 x 10 ³ inch and all fiber is aligned in the length direction. Interlaminar Shear Strength ISS is measured according to the test procedures of ASTM D 2344 76. A span to depth ratio of 4 1 was employed as well as loading at three points. Table II below gives the results obtained using the aforementioned compounds I to IV and an untreated control. A known way of improving adhesion between a reinforcing fiber and a polymeric matrix is to apply a coating of material such as a vinyl ester. Such a treatment is referred to as a subcoat or topcoat and can provide further improvement in adhesion when used in conjunction with the treating agents of the present invention.
