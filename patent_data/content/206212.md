## Description
This invention relates to electrical drive systems, especially DC drive systems. In particular it relates to brushless DC drive systems, including motors and amplifiers, of the type frequently referred to as trapezoidal drives. The invention also encompasses motors forming parts of such systems. The brushless drives in question generally have an armature portion and a field structure portion, and in one form of construction, the field structure portion may be a permanent magnet rotor, having at least two poles, and the armature portion is a stator having windings which are energized in steps to advance the rotor poles and thus bring about rotation of the rotor. Particularly favoured constructions of motors of this type, often referred to as an inside out construction, have six rotor poles and three phase windings. Drives of this general kind are discussed in the papers Electronically Commutated DC Feed Drives for Machine Tools by P. Zimmermann, Motorcon September 1982 proceedings, Ultra High Performance Brushless DC Drive by A. C. Stone and M. G. Buckley, delivered at a conference in Brighton in October 1984, and Novel Design and Control of Trapezoidal Back E.M.F. Motor The Smooth Transition From Brush to Brushless DC by A. C. Stone and M. G. Buckley, Motorcon April 1985. These papers contain extensive discussions of relevant background material in this field. It is known to provide auxiliary recesses on the armature core of a rotary electrical machine having a plurality of winding recesses, to reduce the cogging force, the auxiliary recesses facing a field section. In JP A 55 71163, there is disclosed a rotary electrical machine comprising an outer field section and an inner armature core having a multiplicity of winding recesses. Projecting teeth are located between the winding recesses, and auxiliary recesses of lesser depth than the winding recesses are provided on the tops of these projecting parts or teeth, between the winding recesses. FR A 2,392,525 discloses a generally similar type of arrangement, having recesses in the radially outer faces of projecting members separating winding recesses. All of the embodiments disclosed have indentations on the rotor, and there is no suggestion of any inverted construction in which recesses are provided in stator teeth. The indentations are shown in the majority of the representations as being of part cylindrical cross section, although other shapes of indentation are not excluded. The performance criteria to be met in operation by the indentations are that the effect of the indentations should substantially equate magnetically to that of the spaces between the poles, whether between main poles or between main and auxiliary poles. No specific dimensional criteria are however set down for the indentations, although it is stated that they may be both narrower and of substantially lesser depth than the interpole spaces. This latter requirement, i.e. that the indentations be relatively shallow, appears to be associated with reduction of ripple torque, but would seem to be to some extent opposed to the configuration of the indentations required to provide magnetic consistency as between the effects of the indentations and those of the interpole spaces. FR A 1,584,258 provides a construction of electrical machine in which the polefaces of the rotor or the stator or both may be grooved or recessed, with the object of reducing noise and vibration in operation of the machine. This disclosure is however directed specifically to reluctance motors, in which the stator has a multiplicity of radial slots for accommodating windings, and the rotor has a multiplicity of magnetised salient poles. Machines of this kind are particularly subject to cogging torques. According to the disclosure, the faces of the stator teeth, defined between the winding slots, and or the poles of the rotor, are modified to cut down this cogging torque. The modification of the face profile in question consists of local enlargement of the air gap between the stator pole faces and the rotor teeth. A number of arrangements are provided for achieving this. A basic configuration, shown in Figure 1, provides a single groove extending in the axial direction of the machine in either the stator pole face or in the face of the rotor pole. The circumferential width of this single groove is equal to that of the stator slot opening, but it is represented as being relatively shallow in depth. In a multiple groove arrangement, shown in Figure 4, each stator pole face or rotor tooth or both has three parallel axially extending grooves. The widths of the two outer grooves together equal the width of the single central groove, so that the outer grooves are accordingly smaller than the central groove. In yet another arrangement, Figure 7, there is provided a recessed or dished stator pole face or rotor tooth surface, so that the profiling of the face or faces extends over the entire periphery of the pole or tooth. DE A 3,144,630 relates to a brushless DC motor arrangement having an outer rotor. The objective of the invention is simplification of motor assembly construction. The outer rotor machine has a stator stack and magnets. Hall devices are located both magnetically and physically on the same side of the field magnets as the stator and windings. A particular feature is a cooling plate which supports a circuit board. The arrangement provides a compact machine facilitating easy access to the circuit board. The Hall devices are also supported from the cooling plate, and two mounting holes are provided so that each Hall device can be placed in one or other of two separate dispositions relative to the stator depending on motor requirements. Thus the Hall mounting arrangement allows the location of the Hall devices to be advanced in the direction of rotation as required, but the degree of advance is set at the motor assembly stage. The invention does not provide for variation of the actual degree of Hall advance during running of the machine. Hall devices also form a feature of DE B 2,850,478, directed to an outer rotor brushless DC machine in which a circumferential groove or recess is provided on the opposite side of a flexible continuous rubber magnetic member from the poles of the stationary stator. The axial extents of the magnets and the stator stack appear to be substantially the same. The Hall devices are carried on a support plate and protrude into the annular groove or gap. GB A 2,126,026 describes a method of phase advance of current in a brushless DC motor, in order to increase the available torque at high speed. Three Hall sensors are used, A phase advance circuit processes the rotor position signal to provide the required degree of phase advance. A separate sensor may also be provided in a DC brushless system. Such an arrangement is disclosed in DE B 1,218,503, in the form of an individual sensor having its own activating magnets. The motor rotor cooperates with stator magnets which are separated from the sensor portion of the device by a plate. The separate sensor turns with the machine rotor, since both motor rotor and sensor rotor are mounted on a common shaft. The rotation of the sensor rotor triggers devices such as contacts supported on a carrier. Brushless DC drives are also known comprising speed and torque control means in which overlap of energisation of different phase combinations is employed to provide a smooth torque output. In US A 4,249,116, overlap of this kind is illustrated in Figure 7. At any given time during two phase energisation of a brushless DC motor, two windings are energized. After each 60 It is an object of the invention to provide a DC drive system having a low speed performance adequate for servo use. In particular it is an object of the invention to minimize torque ripple in brushless drives and to provide smooth torque transitions. It is a further object of the invention to provide a machine structure favourable to the elimination of cogging or reluctance torque. Yet further aspects of the invention have as their object the reduction of heat generation in control systems and motors for DC drives of the kind to which the invention relates, and the extension of the speed range of such drives. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an electric motor comprising a stator having a plurality of winding slots and a rotor having a plurality of poles, the stator having at least one dummy slot between at least one pair of adjacent winding slots, characterised in that said at least one dummy slot has a width dimension which is substantially the same as the width dimension of a winding slot and a depth dimension which is large compared with the radial dimension of the airgap between the external periphery of the rotor and the internal periphery of the stator, so that, during relative rotation of the rotor and stator, reluctance force prevailing between the rotor and the stator due to the presence of said at least one dummy slot is substantially the same as the reluctance force prevailing between the rotor and the stator due to the presence of a winding slot, said at least one dummy slot behaving similarly to a winding slot in respect of reluctance force. In an especially favoured construction, the motor has two dummy slots between at least one pair of adjacent winding slots. Preferably the stator has two dummy slots between a pair of adjacent winding slots at a plurality of locations equally spaced around the stator. In a multiphase brushless motor according to this aspect of the invention, the winding slots for each phase within an angular stator increment corresponding to an electrical cycle may be spaced so that the phases are equally spaced electrically within each electrical cycle. In particular, in a three phase construction, the angular spacing between the winding slots of successive phases within each pole pitch may correspond to 120 degrees electrical. In another aspect, the invention provides a brushless drive system, comprising a multiphase motor according to the invention having a plurality of phase windings and control means for energising each phase winding of the motor in a predetermined sequence during system operation, said control means including means for regulating the current flowing in each motor phase during operation of the system in dependence on a current error signal established in the region of a transition between phases by comparison of a required current signal with the actual current present in the incoming phase so that the current error signal is, at least initially, of relatively large magnitude, due to the initial absence of energising current in the incoming phase, and thus demands a large phase current. In a variant of this aspect of the invention, the invention may provide a brushless drive system, comprising a multiphase motor according to the invention having a plurality of phase windings and control means for energising each phase winding of the motor in a predetermined sequence during system operation, said control means including means for regulating the current flowing in each motor phase during operation of the system in dependence on a current error signal established in the region of a transition between phases by comparison of a required current signal with the actual current present in the outgoing phase, so that the current error signal is of relatively small magnitude and initial phase current overshoot may be substantially minimised. In a further control strategy applicable to braking regions of the four operating quadrants of a reversible drive, the drive system of the invention may have means for selecting, for predetermined regions of the torque speed operating quadrants of the motor, said current error signal established by comparison of the required current signal with the actual current present in the incoming phase, and, for other regions of said operating quadrants, a current error signal established by comparison of the required current signal with the actual current present in the outgoing phase. The invention also provides, in yet another aspect, a brushless drive system, comprising a multiphase rotational motor according to the invention having a stator, a rotor, a plurality of phase windings, control means for energising each phase winding in a predetermined sequence during system operation, and sensor means associated with said control means for indicating rotor disposition at each of a plurality of rotational dispositions of the rotor relative to the stator, the control means being responsive to said sensor indication for a first rotor disposition for changeover between phases during rotation of the rotor through a phase transition in one direction of rotation and being responsive to said sensor indication for a second rotor disposition for changeover between the same phases during rotation of the rotor through the same phase transition in the opposite direction of rotation. In a particular construction according to this aspect of the invention, said sensor means may include two switch means for each transition between phases and said sensor indications are provided by changes of state of the switch means, one of said two switch means undergoing a change of state when the rotor is in a first predetermined rotational disposition relative to the stator for determining the changeover between the relevant phases for one direction of rotation through the transition and the other of said switch means undergoing a change of state when the rotor is in a second predetermined rotational disposition relative to the stator for determining the changeover between the same phases for the opposite direction of rotation, and the shorter angular increment of rotation between the rotational disposition of the rotor for a change of state of said one switch means and its rotational disposition for a change of state of said other switch means defining a phase transition region, the system including inhibit means for preventing said control means from initiating changeover between phases on leaving a said phase transition region when the direction of rotation of the rotor is reversed while the rotational disposition of the rotor is within said phase transition region. In a still further aspect, the invention provides a brushless motor, comprising a stator, a rotor having a plurality of poles defined by permanent field magnets, and a plurality of Hall effect devices positioned at a plurality of locations around a circumferential path, each of said devices being activated when there is a respective predetermined angular relationship between the rotor and the stator, said Hall effect devices being disposed radially inwardly of axial end regions of said field magnets, so that said magnets serve also as triggering magnets for the Hall effect devices, and said field magnets being mounted on a generally cylindrical rotor core and extending axially beyond one end of said core, so that the projecting ends of the field magnets overlie the Hall effect devices. The brushless drive system of the invention may comprise a pulse width modulation power supply having at least two switches and control means for regulating the on and off periods of each switch to control current magnitude in the phase windings, the on period of each switch being phase displaced relative to the on period of the other switch under zero net current conditions so that forward and reverse bias currents are established by respective overlap periods between the on periods of the switches. The power supply may have four said switches, the on period of each of said switches being phase displaced relative to the on period of an associated one of said switches under zero net current conditions so that said bias currents are established by the respective overlap periods between the on periods of said switches, the on period of each switch being phase displaced relative to the on period of an associated one of said switches so that forward or reverse currents are established by respective overlap periods between the on periods of said switches. In a system where the motor is a three phase motor, the pulse width modulation power supply may include a six switch bridge and control means for regulating the on and off periods of each switch to control current magnitude in each phase winding, each instantaneously active group of four switches together with the control means substantially instantaneously defining a power supply as defined in the previous paragraph. When the brushless drive system of the invention comprises a three phase motor, said control means may include means for connecting, the phase windings of said motor in either star or delta configuration in dependence on a motor operating parameter, without interruption of motor rotation, said motor parameter being speed and the control means including means for monitoring motor speed. The motor of the invention may comprise a stator having laminations, each stator lamination having at least one radially outwardly extending projection, and said at least one projection of each lamination along the axial length of the motor being circumferentially displaced about the axis of the motor relative to that of another of said laminations so that said projections define a series of circumferential fins for aiding heat dissipation from the stator. Each lamination suitably has two said projections and the projections of each lamination along the axial length of the motor substantially define two ribs extending in a spiral along said axial length. The invention is especially applicable to inside out brushless machines having six rotor poles and three phase windings in the 1 to 40 NM torque range, and in particular in the 6 to 16 NM torque range. Embodiments of the invention will now be described having regard to the accompanying drawings, in which In order to achieve 120 degrees flat top phase response, the poles 3 are defined by high coercivity rare earth cobalt magnets, e.g. samarium cobalt, positioned directly in the airgap and held on rotor 4 by the protective band 5. The samarium cobalt magnets are used to achieve uniform field flux, to minimise armature reaction and inductance, and also to minimise rotor inertia. A concentrated coil arrangement is also used so that a square wave back E.M.F. is inherently generated by the system. Figure 2 shows typical trapezoidal torque versus rotational displacement characteristics for the motor of Figure 1, in which the transition from one phase combination to another as the machine rotates may be clearly noted. As shown in Figure 2, during the 60 Figure 4 shows a schematic circuit diagram for an electronic control system for driving the motor of Figure 1. A high gain velocity loop is used in which an analog velocity command 10 volts reference 6 is fed to the velocity loop incorporating controller 7 from a differential input amplifier not shown . This is compared with the actual motor velocity feedback signal reference 8 , e.g. a voltage proportional to motor rotational speed, monitored by a tachometer 9 or any other suitable sensor means, to produce a velocity error reference 10 , which is fed to a current loop incorporating controller 11. The current loop 11 compares the velocity error 10 which represents a current command with the actual motor current feedback signal reference 12 , e.g. a voltage proportional to current, to produce a current error signal reference 13 . This current error signal 13 is fed to a pulse width modulation PWM stage 14 of the control system. A single current loop is used, this being achieved by multiplexing at 15 the three current feedback signals 16a, 16b, 16c one for each phase into a single loop input 12 to current controller 11 . Selection of the correct phase current 16a, 16b or 16c to be fed into the loop is controlled by commutation information stored in read only memory ROM . This memory contains electronic commutation information addressed by rotor position information provided by a position sensor 17, the PWM lines, and a rotor direction of rotation signal. Outputs from read only memory also provide drive signals for transistors 18a, b, c, d, e, f in the power stage, together with some control signals and status information, to feed the windings 19a, b, c. System monitor 20 includes various protective features necessary for the practical functioning of the system but not to the understanding of its principles of operation. Figure 5 is a tabular chart illustrating in more detail the operation of a system such as that of Figure 4 and may also be compared with Figure 3. In the simple conventional mode of operation shown, the desired direction of rotation is indicated by the input 6 of Figure 4 being positive or negative and rotor position is indicated by three Hall switches A, B and C , which between them define eight possible codes, two of which are illegal, the other six being used for position information. For each segment of rotor rotation identified by a Hall code, two phases are active, as indicated for both reverse and forward modes, and the current in one of these phases is used to provide feedback, as identified by the current sample or feedback row shown in the table. Since each phase is active over a 120 The motor described in relation to and shown in Figure 1 is a six pole machine with a three phase winding. The direct one slot per phase per pole winding arrangement shown results in a total of 18 lamination slots, which is a particularly unhappy number from the point of view of cogging or reluctance torque. In order to obviate this, an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 6 may be used. In this construction, each portion or tooth 21 of the stator lamination lying between a pair of the winding slots 2 is provided with a dummy slot 22. Each dummy slot 22 is essentially a notch in the radially inner face of the lamination tooth 21 and is dimensioned to behave similarly to a winding slot opening 23 from the reluctance torque viewpoint. Basically this means that the notch is the same width as the winding slot and is of a depth which is large compared with the airgap. Thus a basic 18 slot lamination may be converted into what is effectively a 36 slot lamination by providing one dummy slot in each tooth face. The only change at the winding terminals is that the ripple due to slot effects is at twice the frequency which would apply to the 18 slot lamination. Thus the rotor sees 36 slots from the point of view of reluctance torque. The reluctance forces prevailing between the rotor and stator as a result of the presence of the dummy slots are of the same order of magnitude as those due to the winding slots proper. These forces vary as the magnets pass by the slots so that the frequency of cogging is increased. This increase, representing a doubling of the frequency in the case of 36 slots in an 18 winding slot lamination, allows the elimination of cogging torque to be achieved with a lesser degree of for example, skew or short pitching, than would be the case in the absence of the dummy slots. Both of these cogging reduction techniques decrease the extent of the flat top flux linkage from its idealised 180 However the higher frequency of cogging achieved by providing the dummy slots in accordance With the present invention permits the necessary reluctance torque reduction to be achieved with lesser interference with the flux linkage waveforms than would apply in the absence of these dummy slots as well as enabling other difficulties associated with cogging reduction to be substantially minimised. Thus in summary the dummy slot is important in allowing ripple reduction techniques to be used with much less effect on the basic torque or speed voltage output. Because there are now twice as many slots from the reluctance viewpoint, the required skew or short pitch is reduced by half. A similar construction may be employed on a motor armature, as an alternative to or in addition to pole skewing, and this method of minimising or substantially eliminating cogging torque is not necessarily limited to brushless DC drives. A combination of 18 winding slots and 19 dummy slots may be used to give a particularly favourable condition of low cogging. By providing 37 equally spaced teeth around the inner periphery of the stator, the reluctance torque at each point will tend to cancel with that at a point diametrically opposite. Seventeen of the flux carrying teeth each contain a single dummy slot cut in the centre of the tooth face while the eighteenth tooth is one and one half times as wide as the others and contains 2 equally spaced dummy slots. All the openings, both for the windings and the dummy slots, are equally spaced around the circumference. The resultant short pitching effect on the winding reduces the extent of flat top flux linkage per phase by about 30 electrical degrees, which is marginally acceptable in a six step or trapezoidal design. The reduction in flat top is occasioned by each coil of each 6 coil phase winding being short pitched. The slot spacing is uniform at 9.73 Figure 7 shows an alternative lamination having 39 slots. In this arrangement, at least one dummy slot 22 is provided between each adjacent pair of winding slots 2, the dimensions of these dummy slots in terms of circumferential gap being the same as those of the winding slots, so that the samarium cobalt magnets of the rotor again see the dummy slots as though they were real or winding slots. The enhancement in the number of slots increases the frequency of cogging torque, doubling the number of slots doubling the cogging frequency, and also in itself slightly reduces the amplitude of the cogging torque. However the impact of introducing dummy slots may be further improved by the addition of one or more extra dummy slots, for the purpose of reducing the amplitude of the cogging torque, so that at one or more locations around the inner periphery of the stator lamination, two dummy slots 22a, 22b are provided between a pair of adjacent winding slots. As shown in Figure 7, two dummy slots are provided at three locations around the inner periphery of the stator lamination, as defined by its teeth, in circumferentially enlarged stator lamination teeth 24, so that there is a total of 39 slots as perceived by the rotor, while the number of winding slots remains at 18. In the arrangement of Figure 7, all of the slots are equally spaced around the internal periphery of the stator lamination. Since there are 39 of them over the 360 degree periphery of the stator, their angular spacing is thus 9.23 degrees mechanical. Accordingly coils 1, 3 and 5, as identified around the external periphery of lamination 1 in Figure 7, which each span six slots, are short pitched, at 55.38 degrees mechanical, while coils 2, 4 and 6, which span 7 slots, are long pitched, at 64.61 degrees mechanical. Thus the rotor pole peripheries do not exactly match the spacing of the winding coils, this resulting in the elimination of the cogging torque. The degree of short pitch or long pitch in each case equals 4.62 However the arrangement shown in Figure 7 has the side effect of upsetting to a small degree the electrical symmetry of the construction and the 120 degree electrical spacing between the phases is altered. Thus the overlap between torque waveforms is different for different phase transitions. Referring again to Figure 7, it will be apparent that phase B is 18.5 In order to overcome this problem, the construction shown in Figure 8 may be adopted, in which all of the phase B slots and all of the phase C slots are rotated relative to the phase A slots so that there is a full 20 degree mechanical spacing between each phase B slot and its preceding phase A slot and also between each phase C slot and its preceding phase B slot. The spacing between a phase C slot and the following phase A slot across the two dummy slots 22a, 22b in each circumferentially enlarged stator tooth 24 is 24.61 degrees while the spacing across the single dummy slot at each other transition between phases C and A is 15.38 degrees. Coils 1, 3 and 5 accordingly remain short pitched, as in Figure 7, again spanning 55.38 degrees, while coils 2, 4 and 6 are long pitched, at 64.61 degrees. However the mechanical spacing between phase A and phase B is exactly 20 Lamination 1 of Figure 8 also has a fin or projection 25, to be described in more detail in connection with other subsequent drawings. The precise shaping of the teeth which define the winding and dummy slots is not of critical importance, but as set out above, the spacing of the slots is relevant to the elimination or reduction of cogging torque and slot ripple effects, while retaining the trapezoidal shape of the torque wave forms. In yet another construction of stator lamination having dummy slots, 27 slots in total are used, every second tooth having a dummy slot. Still further constructions of lamination embodying suitable arrangements of dummy slots may be devised as required by particular operating needs. Reverting to the control system illustrated in Figure 4, it will be seen that it requires only the positions of the phase transition points to be detected by the position feedback device. At these points it is theoretically desirable to have an instantaneous transition from one phase combination to the next at the point of equal torques, i.e. where the two phase torques are equal. In practice the current rise time on the phase winding is limited by the DC bus voltage and the motor phase inductance. Also, the practical tolerances in volume manufacture mean that it is not readily possible to arrange three sensors precisely coincident with six phase transition points. Even if this were possible, the effects associated with such an arrangement are not necessarily wholly desirable. Under the slow speed conditions required by servo performance, and also under conditions of heavy load, a reduction in torque at the phase transition may result in stalling, or oscillation at the point of equal torque. The reduction in net torque caused by early switching, i.e. before the torque crossover or equal torque point, is shown by the upper diagram of Figure 9. If the outgoing phase is switched off too soon, the incoming current is unable to provide enough torque to maintain a uniform torque level throughout the transition. Thus, to overcome such effects, it is necessary to provide a switch point which will preclude stalling and also to build in some hysteresis at the switch point. In this way, a clean and abrupt transition from one torque waveform to the next may be achieved. This ensures that the motor tends to come smoothly through the phase transition and minimises torque ripple. Thus, according to the present invention, phase commutation is implemented after the point of equal torque, i.e. late switching is used. This has been found to minimise disturbances in velocity through the commutation points and is illustrated in the lower diagram of Figure 9. This technique of late switching also results in an increased torque at the commutation point for a brief period the torque spike indicated in the Figure and eliminates any tendency for the motor to stall. Tolerances may also be taken up in the region immediately surrounding the point of equal torque. In order to provide the necessary position signal on each side of the switch point, a Hall effect switch is positioned to each side of the transition point as indicated schematically in Figure 10. The late switching feature also has a further advantageous effect, in connection with which Figure 10 is again relevant, in that oscillation about the switch point is avoided by the phase energisation configuration of the machine remaining in the combination in which it entered the transition region until such time as it passes the switch on the side from which it emerges from the transition region during a movement without reversal through the transition. Thus oscillation between phases is prevented, and in Figure 10, moving from left to right, the AB phase combination is maintained until Hall 2 is triggered, whereas when moving from right to left, the AC combination is preserved until Hall 1 is reached. Thus there is late switching in both directions during movement through a transition and there is no oscillation within the transition region. In addition, a further information bit is provided in the control system to prevent phase change on reversal of the direction of rotation within the transition region, i.e. between Hall 1 and Hall 2, especially at slow speed. By the detection of tachometer polarity and the provision of a suitable address bit, clockwise or anticlockwise rotation is detected and the controller may be made aware of the direction from which the rotor is approaching the switch point so that an appropriate direction input may be provided to the controller. A latch on the direction input renders it inoperative insofar as activating the phase change is concerned if reversal takes place in the transition region between Halls 1 and 2. Thus if the motor is reversed after passing Hall 1 in the AB configuration but before reaching Hall 2, no phase change takes place and it moves back along the AB characteristic. The current flowing in each phase in the motor of Figure 4 is sensed by an electrically isolated sampling circuit. However since only two phases are active at any one time, only the current in one phase requires to be controlled. This in turn necessitates only the one current loop. The three phase currents are thus applied to multiplexer 15, which selects the appropriate phase current, depending on the rotor position and direction, in accordance with instructions stored in a PROM. It will be apparent that for any phase combination there is in theory a choice as to which phase current may be monitored in order to obtain the current feedback, and in general it is immaterial which of the two currents available at any given time is used, except in the transition regions between phases. In the operating modes set out in the chart of Figure 5 for the system of Figure 4, the straightforward and conventional option is adopted of selecting the same phase current for feedback purposes over each 120 An advantageous construction of control system for a drive in accordance with the invention will now be described having regard to Figures 12 to 17. The system of Figure 12 has similarities of configuration to that of Figure 4 and corresponding features are identified by the references already used in Figure 4. A command input signal 6 sets a desired operating condition for velocity loop 7, which is compared against actual velocity 8. The velocity error 10 provides the input to current loop 11, with 12 representing the actual current input to this loop. The current error signal drives PWM generator 14. Multiplexer 15 serves to select the appropriate current 16a, b, or c for feedback 12 into the current loop. Position sensors six in number provide inputs 26 for use in PROM 27 for phase control of the base drives and these inputs are also applied to the PROM of multiplexer 15. In contrast with the conventional system of Figure 5, where the direction of desired rotation resulted in one or other of the phase sequences being energised, the PWM mode of Figure 12 results in both forward and reverse currents being generated so that a bias is established to hold the motor against rotation under standstill conditions. The actual current level is set by the current loop while the generator 14 establishes the PWM pulse width. The output of generator 14 provides inputs to PROM 27, which selects the individual phases to be driven in dependence on rotor position. The chart of Figure 13 sets out similar manner to that of Figure 5 the various inputs to PROM 27, disregarding certain elaborations of the system to be subsequently explained. The chart also relates to simple transitions using only three Hall switches. It will be seen that the four possible modes of operation are determined by the three bits of information defined by PWM Forward, PWM Reverse and Direction. These are represented respectively on Figure 12 by input 28 from the forward amplifier 29 of PWM generator 14, input 30 from reverse amplifier 31, and input 32 from polarity detector 33. Input 32 provides a signal indicative of the actual direction of rotation of the rotor. Only four of the possible combinations of these 0 or 1 on off type inputs are used for phase control and the remainder represent either illegal conditions indicative of a logic error, or a PWM off condition. PROM 27 is programmed to recognise the appropriate inputs and in conjunction with these and the further inputs 26 from the Hall switches, to establish the appropriate phase combinations in the sequences set out in the chart. The phase combination sequence for reverse operation is read from left to right and that for forward operation from right to left, but each individual combination within a sequence is read from left to right. The chart also shows the phase current to be used as the sample for current feedback to provide the rising edge incoming phase arrangement of Figures 10 and 11. The Hall information 26 provides a further input to a PROM of multiplexer 15 for this purpose. The plus or minus sign against each current sample relates to the need to take account of the direction of the energising current in the phase, since it reverses between each combination in which each individual phase is involved in the course of a single electrical cycle, and each input 16a, 16b or 16c to multiplexer 10 is thus duplicated, so that the current signal can be read in the sense appropriate for maintaining rotor rotation in the desired direction. If the current signal were to be considered with regard to magnitude only and ignoring direction, those signals denoted as negative would be interpreted as rotation in the wrong or undesired direction. The chart of Figure 14 represents an elaboration of that of Figure 13 in which six Hall A, B, C, D, E and F switches are provided and transition regions can thus be identified. The transitions are indicated in Figure 14 by the cross over points in the outline phase torque diagram shown under the Hall codes at the top of the chart. Inhibiting of phase change on reversal within the transition region, as noted in regard to Figure 10, is achieved by latch 34 of Figure 12, which interrupts input 32 in the presence of an input 35 from multiplexer 15 indicative of the rotor disposition corresponding to a transition region. Triggering of latch 34 by signal 35 disables input 32 to PROM 27 and prevents phase change in a transition region, so that if reversal takes place in this region, the phase combination prevailing on entry to the transition region is maintained. Outside the transition region, Hall switch latch input 35 allows the polarity or direction signal 32 unimpeded access to PROM 27. It will be noted on the chart then in each transition region the settings of the two Hall groups ABC and DEF are different, while in the non transition regions they are the same. In regard to still further elaborations of the system of Figure 12, Figure 15 shows eight operating regions relevant to a motor according to the invention, in terms of speed and torque. In the forward and reverse braking quadrants, at higher speeds, current monitoring based on rising edges, i.e. the incoming phase, may result in current overshoot, and in order to obviate this, in the higher speed regions of these quadrants, current feedback may be based on the trailing edges or outgoing phases of each phase combination. The rising and trailing edges of the three current waveforms are shown in Figure 16. With rising edge current feedback, for a particular operating mode, current is monitored in the sequence B, A, C, B, A, C, whereas in the case of trailing edge monitoring, the sequence is C, B, A, C, B, A. The monitoring sequences are held in the PROM of multiplexer 15 and the appropriate sequence selected in dependence on machine speed, direction of torque i.e. whether the current is positive or negative and direction of rotation. These three bits of information establish uniquely which of the eight operating regions of Figure 15 is present. Machine speed as measured by a sensor such as a tachometer provides an input 36 to a threshold means 37, which when the speeds exceeds a preset value, applies an input 38 W In the presence of suitable combinations of inputs, as set out in full in the final chart, Figure 17, current feedback is transferred from the rising edges or incoming phases to the trailing edges or outgoing phases, when the motor operating mode is in the high speed braking regions of the quadrants of Figure 15. The chart of Figure 17 incorporates all the features of that of Figure 14 along with the additional columns necessitated by inputs W The diagram of Figure 15 may be referred to as representing eight quadrant operation. Hysteresis is built into the W An advantageous arrangement of rotor position sensing by the use of Hall effect devices may be achieved by the arrangement shown in Figure 18. As is well known, Hall effect devices provide contact free sensing and operate up to high temperatures. In order to minimise the motor length, the Hall effect devices 41a of the sensor are operated by the magnets 3 which produce the main motor field flux, thus eliminating the length occupied in the case of a conventional design by a separate position sensor. In order to guarantee reliable information from the Hall devices when placed in the vicinity of the strong magnetic fields produced by the large motor currents, the positioning of the Hall devices underlying an axial end portion of the rotor magnets is important, so that the field produced by the motor currents is negligible in the vicinity of the Hall devices compared with that created by the magnets 3. In addition, in order that there is an airgap to one side only of the Hall devices, they are underlaid by a steel flux return ring 41b, against which they are directly juxtaposed. Thus there is an airgap on the radially outward sides only of the devices, between them and the magnets 3, and they are backed on their radially inwards sides by the flux return ring. Ring 41b serves to intensify the field strength in an advantageous manner. As well as the items already indicated in connection with Figure 1, including the motor shaft 4 on which the magnets 3 are mounted and retained, Figure 18 also shows rear end bell 42 within which the shaft turns in bearing 43. Axial thermal expansion between the axially outward end of bearing 43 and end bell 42 is taken up or accommodated by wavy washer 44. The Hall devices are disposed at the free axial ends of nylon posts 45, which are mounted on the end bell by means of adjustable clamps 46. The axial ends of the magnets thus overlie the Hall devices which are triggered by the transitions between successive poles, i.e. by polarity changes. The switches are positioned so as to give the required signals at the appropriate stages of each electrical cycle. The switches and their mounting posts 45 are thus located in otherwise unused space underlying the axial ends 47 of the windings. In order to reduce motor temperature, i.e. to reduce losses due to switching in a motor, it is usual to use a choke of the order of one to several millihenries in series with a DC motor. In the case of brushless three phase motors, one such choke must be used in each of the motor phases. While providing an effective solution to the problem of motor heating, the inclusion of such chokes in a brushless DC drive system may frequently be impractical and is necessarily expensive. Figure 19 shows a standard pulse width modulating system in which pulses are supplied simultaneously to transistors A and D and in turn B and C in order to maintain a current Im in the motor. Each transistor in the circuit of Figure 19 has an associated flyback diode. This arrangement results in a relatively rapid rate of decay of the flyback current, so that the ripple current, which determines the heating, is relatively large. The rate of rise and fall of current in such a system is controlled by both the DC bus voltage V and the total load inductance Ls plus Lm . Hence the problem of large current ripple and thus motor heating is more acute for low inductance loads and for high voltage converters. The modulation technique shown in Figure 20 tackles this problem by maintaining a transistor on between the two firing pulses, so that the flyback current will flow through a different circuit and the rate of current decay will be slower than the rate of rise. Thus the current ripple is reduced. Such an arrangement is effective for large currents and for single ended loads but presents difficulties in application at low currents and zero speed. High performance servo drives require a high degree of stiffness and no dead band over the whole area of the four quadrants of the torque speed curve. To achieve this a small bias current may be applied to the motor in the zero speed condition to ensure zero stiffness and no dead band. Thus the zero speed switching condition shown in Figure 21 is required, in which the modulation technique of Figure 20 becomes quite clearly impossible, in that if transistor D were to remain on during the off period, this would result in shoot through when transistor B turns on. An improved modulation technique illustrated in Figure 22 allows bias current operation near zero together with the application of a lock up technique to the transistors from zero to full current. In addition, circulating or flyback currents are shared equally between the flyback diodes. The no load condition shown in Figure 22 illustrates clearly that at zero speed there is an equal and opposite alternating bias current flowing in the motor, the forward pulses F being established by the overlap between the on periods of transistors A and D and the reverse pulses R being established by the overlap between the on periods of transistors B and C. In addition transistor A operates on the inverse signal of transistor C, as do the B and D transistors. Thus the switching cycle is Under load, the base drive waveforms shown in Figure 23 apply. Forward pulses F are established by the overlap between the on periods of transistors A and D but there are now no reverse pulses, since there is no overlap between the on periods of transistors B and C. The base drive signal for transistor C is the inverse of that for A, while that for transistor D is the inverse of that for B. Thus there exists the danger of shoot through, since there is no delay or dead time between switching off transistor A and switching on transistor C. Accordingly a delay, for example, of 10 microseconds, must be added to each on signal in the base drive section, to avoid the occurrence of a shoot through condition. When forward current flows, transistors B and C are also switching but no losses are associated with this. Even though a base drive signal is applied to these transistors, no collector current can flow, because the flyback diode associated with each of these transistors is conducting during some of the notional on time for the transistor, so that the transistor is reverse biassed. Since the B and C on signals do not occur together at any point, a complete circuit for the collector current is never created. Thus the system provides a notional switching of these transistors but no switching or steady state losses are incurred. The circuit arrangement shown schematically in outline in Figure 24 combines a square wave with standard pulses through a series of NAND gates. F bar represents the inverse of a standard technique forward pulse, while signal R bar is the inverse of a standard technique reverse pulse. PWM is the square wave from which the PWM sawtooth signal is normally derived. The system described has the particular advantage that gear changing is not required. Thus the same modulation technique is used not only about the zero point but also at higher values of load current. Accordingly there is no disturbance on the motor shaft at any stage, which would occur if there were a gear change or modulation technique change. This heat minimising PWM technique is especially useful in brushless DC drives but is in not limited to such drives and may also be applied to DC motors of other kinds and for inductive loads in general. In the three phase systems described hereinabove, star mode is used, with the three motor phases being internally connected and current applied to the three external phase ends. This arrangement is shown in Figure 25, along with the sequence of phase combinations followed as the motor turns through an electrical cycle. Each phase carries current for two consecutive working strokes, is switched off for one working stroke and then carries current in the opposite direction for the next two. The terminal torque sensitivity is twice the phase torque sensitivity and as each phase current is a square wave with a two one mark space ratio, the RMS current is the square root of two thirds of the peak current. In order to provide a drive capable of delivering high torque with low speed and running to high speed at low torque levels, a star delta changeover technique may be employed which doubles the speed range of a given three phase full wave inverter drive with minimal addition to system cost or complexity. Delta mode, in which only a single phase is active at any one time, is shown in Figure 26. The phase sequence shows that each phase carries current for one period in three and the RMS current is the square root of one third of the peak current. Terminal torque sensitivity is thus equal to phase torque sensitivity in this case. Figure 27 shows a power circuit for implementation of star delta changeover without any interruption of motor rotation or any physical change, e.g. operation of a switch, in the circuit, together with the operating sequences in both the star and delta modes. A standard full wave three phase inverter bridge is associated with two extra power devices controlling the neutral point of a star connected three phase winding. Figure 28 is a timing diagram for this circuit, from which it may be seen that when the drive is in star mode, transistors 7 and 8 are not used, while in delta mode only one of the transistors 1 to 6 is on at any one time and either transistor 7 or 8 is on in every commutation cycle, to provide a return path. An example of torque speed characteristic obtainable with such a combination is shown in Figure 29. At low speed the drive operates in star mode and so sees a motor torque sensitivity equal to twice that of the single phase. A comparator from the speed feedback device detects if the drive exceeds a preset speed corresponding to the optimum point for transfer from star to delta mode. In the example shown, this speed is about 2,700 rpm, and is thus below the maximum speed and peak torque of 3,500 rpm and 40 NM respectively of the star mode configuration. Above this 2,700 rpm threshold, the control logic is changed from star to delta mode so that the motor torque sensitivity is halved. Figures 30 and 31 show in pictorial and development views respectively, a cooling fin arrangement provided on the external periphery of the stator lamination 1 of Figure 8. Each fin 25 extends over 60
