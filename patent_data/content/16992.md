## Claims
Claims 1. Procedure for the regeneration of ion exchange resins where these resins treat, through alkali magnesium exchan ge, sugar juices yielding molasses as a final product with a high magnesium content, while the resins are depleted due to the enrichment of Sodium and or Potassium ions with Magnesium loss, characterized by the fact that regeneration of the resin occours through percolation of the molasses containing magnesium ions with fresh rea gent additives containing magnesium ions such as B agne sium Chloride, causing ion exchange and regenerating the resins with Magnesium ion, while the Sodium and or Potas sium ions return to the molasses for the purpose of eliminating the effluents polluted by the chloride ions so that the molasses can be recovered and can be easily used and also to reduce fresh reagent consumption. 2.

## Description
Process and installation for regeneration of ion exchange resins during the alkali magnesium process through molasses regeneration obtained from this process, enriched with fresh regenerating salts .It is well known that sugar mills use ion exchange resins, capable of partially replacing the most molassige nic cations, such Sodium and Potassium by one less molas sigenic cation, like Magnesium, to increase the saccharose content. This procedure is currently emloyed by using a cation resin, like Amberlite IR 122 S, in the form of Magnesium, by percolation of a Magnesium Chlori de solution through the resin the Quentin Process ag resulting from a German Patent DP 974408 .Subsequently the cations, as for example Sodium and orPotassium, are replaced by the Magnesium cations knownQuentin process by letting the sugar juice containing the highest molassigenic cations percolate on the ion exchange resin in the above mentioned form. hen the resins are depleted, they must be regenerated and, with the aforesaid procedure, this regeneration is currently obtained by percolation of a Magnesium Chlori de solution which triggers the exchange and the substitution of the Magnesium by Sodium and or Potassium, resulting in great quantities of Chloride ions in the ef fluents.This high concentration rate of Chloride ions in the ef fluents is a great drawback, since the permissible limit stated by the anti pollution Laws is exceeded, while it is impossible, for obvious economic reasons, to eliminate this concentration chemicallyXfrom the effluents. Thus the effluents must be kept in large besins and drained little by little, but they shall represent a pollution source.A second drawback lies in current sugar juice treatment with resins in the Alkali magnesium process. This juio ce, after treatment, is further processed for sugar recovery, the final product, molasses, has an indicatory content of approximately 80 of Magnesium ion released during the ion exchange. This high Maghesium content prevents the traditional conversion or utilisation of molasses which, as iS known, is a high energy product.The procedure regarding this invention greatly reduces, or eliminates, the aforesaid drawbackes since the cloride ions containing polluting effluents are totally eliminated thus obtaining molasses having a low magnesium content with the advantage of noticeably reducing the consumption of the fresh regenerating product such as Magnesium Chloride.According to the procedure of this invention, the regeneration of the depleted resins is ached through percollation of the molasses derived from treatment of the previous sugar juice with resins and containing, as has been stated before, a high percentage of Magnesium, pro vided a proper amount of fresh reagent is added to the molasses. This process is earmarked by the fact that in order tp regenerate the ion exchanging resins such as Amberlite IR 122 S in the form of Magnesium, the molasses obtained after crystallization of the juices previously treated with these resins is percolated since the molasses contains for indicatory purposes, about 80 o of the magnesium required to regenerate the resin in the required form, i.e. in the form of Magnesium.It is however necessary to add an amount of fresh reagent such as Magnesium Chloride to this molasses at the ratio, for indicatory purposes, of about 20goy to reach the total Magnesium ion ratio for regeneration.This molasses with its additives will yield the magnesium cation to the resin, acquiring Sodium and or Potas sium cations during percolation on the ion exchange resin. At this stage, the ion exchange resins are ready to start another cycle and the effluent molasses will keep less Magnesium cations and thus be for more suitable for subsequent traditional transformations or for normal usage.For informative purposes, the enclosed drawing shows a block diagram of the processing and regenerative system of the ion exchange resins in the Alkali magnesium process according to the currently known Quentin process and the one according to this patent.Figure 1 shows in a block diagram the sugar juice proces sing with alkali magnesium exchange resins.Figure 2 shows in a block diagram the resin regeneration as currently achieved.Figure 3 shows in a block diagram the sugar juice treat ment with alkali magnesium exchange resins and subse quent regeneration according to this patent.With reference to Figure 1, the sugar juice 1 to be purified penetrates and percolates in the resin columa,He re the alkali magnesium exchange takes place i. e. theSodium and or Potassium ions pass on to the resin while the Magnesium ions pass on to juice. The processed juice 2 undergoes various subsequent treatments B vacuum panningcrystallization, centrifugation, etc. until crystallized sugar 3 and molasses 4 are obtained, subje cted to further transformations or uses C.As already stated, this molasses has a high Magnesium content.Regeneration of resin see Figure 2 is obtained by per colating the regenerated fresh product 5, such as Magne sium.Chloride, in the depleted A column in order to obtain the alkali magnesium ion exchange and to regenerate the resins with magnesium ions, while the effluents 6, with a highly polluting chloride content are diahar ged in the tanks D.In the procedure and installation covered by the patent as shown in Figure 3, the molasses obtained from the treatment of the juices is heated and is diluted in E and thus enters as regenerating agent the depleted column A inWS tives with a suitable percentage of fresh regenerative agents 5 have been added. The molasses and the fresh regenerating agent lose their magnesium ions to the resin while being enriched with Sodium and or Po tassium ions. The effluent molasses after concentration in F can be subjected to further treatments or utilization C, feci litated by the lower magnesium content. methodical washing operations are obviously necessary between ion exchange treatments and regeneration and vi ceversa to prevent mixing of the fluids.Obviously, this patent is also valid if the examplified magnesium cation is replaced by any other cation apt to take the place of the more molassigenic cat ions of the sugar juices to obtain high sugar and molasses extractions of low purity.
