## Description
Interleukin 2 hereinafter referred to as IL 2 , formerly referred to as T cell growth factor, is a soluble protein, which is produced from T cells activated with a lectin or an antigen Morgan, D. A. et al. Science, The problem underlying the present invention is to provide a pure IL 2 preparation which is free from contaminants produced by human cells. The present invention relates to a human interleukin 2 polypeptide preparation having a specific activity of about 5x10⁷ units mg, wherein the polypeptide bears threonine as the C terminal amino acid and no sugar moiety. The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising this interleukin 2 polypeptide preparation. The IL 2 polypeptides which bear threonine as the C terminal amino acid and have no sugar moiety may be produced by cells of Escherichia coli which have been transformed by the incorporation of a recombinant DNA possessing a DNA fragment coding for IL 2 polypeptide into a host of Escherichia coli. The invention furthermore relates to a new plasmid comprising a DNA sequence coding for a human interleukin 2 polypeptide which is obtainable from any of the transformants FERM BP 225, FERM BP 226, FERM BP 248, FERM BP 249 or FERM BP 245. The invention is further illustrated by the enclosed drawings. Figure 1 shows a restriction endonuclease cleavage map of a cloned gene coding for IL 2 polypeptide. Figure 2 shows the base sequence of the cloned gene. Figure 3 shows the plasmid vector pTrS 3. Figure 4 is a flow chart showing the construction of recombinant DNA pTIL2 21. Figure 5 is a flow chart showing the construction of a recombinant DNA pTIL2 22. In the Figures, A , G , C and T represent deoxyadenylic acid, deoxyguanylic acid, deoxycytidylic acid and thymidylic acid, respectively. The new IL 2 polypeptides of the present invention bear threonine as the C terminal amino acid and no sugar moiety. One example of the IL 2 polypeptides has alanine as the N terminal amino acid, and more precisely has the following amino acid sequence I. Another example of the IL 2 polypeptides has proline as the N terminal amino acid, and more precisely has the following amino acid sequence II. The IL 2 polypeptides of the present invention were produced in cells of The IL 2 produced intracellularly or extra cellularly is recovered by any known method, such as precipitation with ammonium sulfate, dialysis to remove salts under normal or vacuum pressure , gel filtration, chromatography, preparative flat bed iso electric focusing, gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography hereinafter HPLC , ion exchange, gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography , and affinity chromatography on dye bound carrier, on activated Sepharose 4B coupled with monoclonal antibody against said IL 2 or on lectin bound Sepharose 4B and the like. Methods of recovery, and purification of IL 2, are described in Watson et al., J. Exp. Med., The activity of IL 2 may be ascertained by the microassay procedure principally discussed by Gillis et al. Gillis, S. et al., J. Immunol., IL 2 possesses the activity to promote the proliferation of T lymphocytes, which enables the measurement of IL 2 activity using an index of T cell growth activity. That is, five CTLL cells are transferred into 100 µℓ of DMEM containing 2 FCS in 96 well flat bottomed microplates together with 100 µℓ of the serially diluted translation products. After 72 to 96 hours incubation at 37 C in a 5 CO₂ incubator, the number of cells grown and activated is counted under microscopy. As a positive external control group, 100 units ml, 10 units ml of IL 2 are added and the IL 2 activity of the test sample is calculated in comparison with the number of grown viable cells in these control groups. The polypeptide thus obtained shows the same biochemical and biological behavior as has been known for IL 2 produced by mammalian cells by mitogen stimulation, and has IL 2 activity. The molecular weight is around 15,000 dalton and IL 2 activity was completely neutralized or precipitated with monoclonal anti IL 2 antibody in the presence or absence of immunoadsorbents, such as Igsorb Enzyme Center . In immunoelectrophoresis, the IL 2 polypeptide shows only a single precipitate against the corresponding anti IL 2 antibody. The IL 2 activity remains stable after reduction with 2 mercaptoethanol, and is resistant to treatment with DNAse and RNAse as well as to heat treatment at 56 C for 30 min. The activity is stable at a pH between pH 2 to 9. The IL 2 produced could promote the growth of monoclonal functional T cells cytotoxic T lymphocyte , enhance the thymocyte mitogenesis, give rise to the generation of anti tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes from memory state in the absence of the antigen, and could be used to augment natural killer cell activity against YAC l and RL l cells. The IL 2 polypeptide preparations of the present invention are free from physiologically active substances produced by human cells, and can be more convenient for the therapeutic use than the known IL 2 polypeptide preparation produced by a human cell.
