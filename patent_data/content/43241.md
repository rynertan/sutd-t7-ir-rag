# RECOIL OPERATED FIRING PIN RETRACTOR FOR ELECTRICALLY FIRED GUNS

## Abstract
An electrically fired gun, of the type having a transverse sliding breechblock, has a recoil operated mechanism for retracting the firing pin electrode tip behind the face of the breechblock during its opening and closing movements. A movable weight is connected by a rocker arm to the firing pin assembly, and is normally latched in place to hold the electrode tip in a retracted position. Manual release of the latch allows a spring to extend the electrode tip into a firing position. Recoil of the gun on firing results in a movement of the weight that retracts the electrode tip, and the parts are automatically re latched in this position.
