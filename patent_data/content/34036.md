# Encoders and decoders for cyclic block codes.

## Abstract
An encoder 12 is disclosed for generating a cyclically encoded n bit channel word from an incoming k bit data word, the encoder comprising generator word and data word shift registers 4100 and 4200 , input and buffer shift registers 4300 and 4400 to 4800 and gating and clocking means. For the encoder to function properly when the number of parity bits is small, one of the buffer registers is partitioned into segments 4600, 4700, 4800 which have predetermined lengths FIG. 4 . A complementary decoder 20 is also described.
