## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a halogen containing polyether, more particularly a fluorine and or chlorine containing polyether. FR A 1 401 154 discloses substituted oxetane polymers prepared by ring opening polymerization in the presence of special initiators. An object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of a halogen containing straight polyether. Further object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of a chemically and or thermally stable halogen containing polyether. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of a halogen containing polyether. This object is achieved by a process for preparing a halogen containing polyether comprising repeating units of the formula Typically, the halogen containing polyether which can be prepared according to the inventive process is a fluorine containing polyether comprising repeating units of the formula In a preferred embodiment the inventive process is a process for preparing fluorine containing polyether comprising repeating units of the formula In another preferred embodiment the inventive process is a process for preparing a halogen containing polyether of claim 1, which is a fluorine chlorine containing polyether comprising repeating units of the formula In the formulas in the specification, the sequence of the repeating units may be random and is not necessarily the same as defined in the formulas. The fluorine containing polyether II can be prepared by ring opening polymerization of 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane. 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane is a known compound and is prepared, for example, by reacting tetrafluoroethylene and paraform in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The ring opening polymerization is initiated by a polymerization initiator. Initiators are alkali metal halide or alkali metal fluoride and acyl fluoride, which reacts with the alkali metal fluoride to generate alkoxy anion, or trimethylamine. An amount of the initiator is not critical in the present invention. Preferably, it is from 0.001 to 30 by mole, more preferably from 0.01 to 10 by mole, based on the amount of 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane. Specific examples of the alkali metal halides are potassium fluoride, potassium iodide, potassium bromide, cesium fluoride, etc. When the polymerization is initiated by the alkali metal halide, generally, a produced compound has the formula When an acyl fluoride of the formula wherein R and p is an integer of 0 to 50 is added to the polymerization system in which the alkali metal fluoride is used as the initiator, produced is the compound V in which A is a group of the formula When acyl fluoride of the formula As understood from the above, a comparatively highly volatile low molecular weight compound contained in a high molecular weight product is recovered by distillation and added to the subsequent reaction as the initiator together with alkali metal fluoride. Instead of using the acyl fluoride, a fluorine containing epoxide is reacted with alkali metal fluoride to obtain an acyl fluoride, which is, in turn, reacted with 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane. For example, hexafluoropropylene oxide is reacted with cesium fluoride in the aprotic solvent to obtain a compound of the formula wherein p is an integer of 0 to 50. Then, 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane is added to the reaction mixture to obtain the same compound as obtained when the above acyl fluoride alone is used. Alternatively, a compound of the formula wherein A is the same as defined above, p is an integer of 2 to 200 and q is an integer of 0 to 50 is prepared by firstly ring opening 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane in the presence of the alkali metal halide initiator or the initiator system of alkali metal fluoride and the acyl fluoride and then adding hexafluoropropylene oxide. As understood from the above discussion, theoretically, it is possible to provide an alternative or block copolymer of 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane and an epoxide compound eg. hexafluoropropylene oxide which can be ring opening polymerized by the same initiator system. Further, when a bifunctional acyl fluoride eg. oxalic fluoride is used together with alkali metal fluoride to open 2,2,3,3 tetrafluorooxetane, a bifunctional compound of the formula Generally, in the presence of alkali metal fluoride, any acyl fluoride that forms an equilibrium amount of fluoroalkoxy anion according the following equation Preferred example of the Lewis acidic initiator is antimony pentafluoride. The reaction of the invention is usually carried out in a liquid reaction medium. When the initiator other than the Lewis acidic one is used, an aprotic solvent such as polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether eg. diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, etc. is preferably used. In acetonitrile or glyme CH₃OCH₂CH₂OCH₃ , the reaction of the invention hardly or does not proceed, but a small amount of a large cyclic polyether such as 18 crown ether 6 accelerates the reaction in these solvents. Acetonitrile and glyme are preferred since they have low boiling points and are easily removed from the reaction mixture by distillation. When the Lewis acidic initiator is used sometimes, a dimer or trimer of hexafluoropropylene is used. The reaction temperature varies with the kinds of the initiator and or the solvent. Usually, it is 30 to 100 C, preferably 30 to 50 C. The product is recovered from the reaction mixture by a per se conventional method. The solid product is recovered, for example, by washing the reaction mixture with water to remove the solvent and initiator and filtering it. The volatile product is recovered, for example, by rectification. The reaction product has a structure of the formula V with the acyl fluoride end group having high reactivity, and is per se useful. In some instances, a chemically inactive compound is required. For example, when the acyl fluoride V is heated in the dimer or trimer of hexafluoropropylene in the presence of antimony pentafluoride as a catalyst, a compound of the formula The fluorine containing polyether comprising the repeating units of the formula Fluorination is carried out by reacting fluorine gas with the polyether II at a temperature of from 160 to 300 C, preferably from 180 to 250 C. Fluorination may be carried out at a temperature lower than the above temperature range. At such low temperature, the fluorination is accelerated by ultraviolet radiation. In the latter reaction, hydrogen fluoride is inevitably produced. Therefore, the light source must be protected by a material which is resistant to hydrogen fluoride and transmits light having a wavelength of from 200 to 400 nm, preferably from 300 to 400 nm. Thus, the fluorination with ultraviolet radiation cannot be carried out in a reactor having a window made of glass eg. quartz glass which is usually used for photoreaction, since glass is corroded by hydrogen fluoride. A light transmitting material to be used in the fluorination of the invention is single crystal sapphire or a melt moldable transparent fluorine containing polymer. Specific examples of such fluorine containing polymer are tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymers, tetrafluoroethylene perfluoropropyl vinyl ether copolymers, tetrafluoroethylene ethylene copolymers, polychlorotrifluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride. Since single crystal sapphire is expensive and one having a large area is hardly obtainable, the fluorine containing polymer is commercially preferred. When the reactor is radiated by ultraviolet light from the reactor interior, a transparent glass part is covered with the fluorine containing polymer. When the reactor is radiated by an outside light source, the transparent window is made of the fluorine containing polymer film. To make the window pressure resistant, the film is laminated on a plate made of glass, for example, quartz glass. The reaction system may be radiated directly or through a gas phase. Usually, ultraviolet light has a wavelength of from 200 to 400 nm, preferably from 250 to 350 nm. When the fluorination is carried out with ultraviolet radiation, the reaction temperature is not critical. However, the reaction system is heated to a temperature at which the system is stirred to smoothly promote the fluorination. Thus, the reaction temperature mainly depends on the molecular weight of the polyether II . Generally, as the fluorination proceeds, flow point and viscosity of the product decrease and correspondingly the reaction temperature can be lowered. Practically, the reaction temperature is from 0 to 120 C, preferably from a room temperature to 100 C. Fluorination may be carried out by bubbling the fluorine gas in the reaction system or by injecting the gas in the gas phase. The fluorine gas may be diluted with an inactive gas eg. carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc. . The fluorination can be carried out continuously or batch wise. When the polyether II having an end group of the formula A completely fluorinated polyether comprising repeating units of the formula It is difficult to isolate the completely fluorinated polyether from such a mixture by a conventional distillation. However, the completely fluorinated polyether is separated from the partly fluorinated one with a polar solvent such as acetone. When the above mixture is dissolved in the polar solvent, the completely fluorinated polyether is contained in the lower layer and easily recovered by liquid liquid separation. The fluorine chlorine containing polyether comprising the repeating units of the formula Fluorination is carried out in the same manner as described above. Chlorination is carried out by reacting chlorine gas with the polyether II or III with radiation of ultraviolet light having a wavelength of from 200 to 500 nm. The reaction temperature varies with the molecular weight of the polyether to be chlorinated and is kept at a temperature at which the reaction system can be stirred. Generally, as chlorination proceeds, the viscosity of the reation system decreases and correspondingly the reaction temperature is lowered. Usually, the reaction temperature is from 30 to 200 C, preferably from 50 to 150 C. Chlorination may be carried out by bubbling the chlorine gas in the reaction system or by injecting the gas in the gas phase. The chlorine gas may be diluted with an inactive gas eg. argon, nitrogen, etc. . Any reactor that is radiated by an inside or outside light source may be used for chlorination. As a transparent material, quartz or Pyrex glass are preferred. Chlorination of the polyether II affords a halogen containing polyether comprising the repeating units of the formula The polyether IV is produced by fluorinating the polyether XVIII . Alternatively, the polyether II is firstly fluorinated to produce the polyether III and then chlorinated to produce the polyether IV . The main chain of the polyether of the invention is chemically thermally stable and used in the same applications as conventional fluororesins and perfluoropolyether. For example, the polyether having the acyl fluoride end group is useful as an intermediate for the production of various fluorine containing compounds. Those having a carboxyl end group are useful, for example, as surfactants. Those having a stabilized end group are heat and chemical resistant oils and thus useful as heat transfer medium, lubricant, plasticizer, modifier, etc. Those having a large molecular weight are used as molding materials.
