# Polypropylene compositions having improved impact strength properties at low temperatures and process for preparing same.

## Abstract
Polypropylene compositions having high impact strength at low temperatures comprising as essential com ponents 100 parts by weight of polypropylene having an isotactic ity index 90, 8 25 parts by weight of an amorphous copolymeric fraction 1 of ethylene propylene soluble in xylene at 23 C, containing 20 80 by weight of ethylene, 2 10 parts by weight of an ethylene propylene crystalline copolymeric fraction 2 having a crystallinity of the polyethylene type containing 50 90 by weight of ethylene and in which the weight ratio between the total polymerized ethylene and fraction 1 is 1. The compositions are prepared by polymerization pro cesses comprising at least a step of homopolymerization of propylene to stereoregular polymer and a subsequent step of polymerization of ethylene propylene mixtures in the presence of catalysts comprising a titanium compound carried on a magnesium halide in active form.
