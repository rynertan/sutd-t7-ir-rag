# Semiconductor switch.

## Abstract
A semiconductor switch is proposed which comprises a thyristor 1 of PNPN structure with three PN junctions and with anode, cathode and gate electrodes, a first transistor 21, 70 for short circuiting at least one PN junction of said thyristor upon its saturation, and a second transistor 30, 60 provided between the anode side or cathode side of the thyristor and the base of said first transistor so as to make the first transistor in saturation in accordance with the voltage which is applied to the anode or cathode of the thyristor. The ratio of the time constant of the second transistor to that of said thyristor is not substantially less than 0.5.
