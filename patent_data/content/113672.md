# SIGNAL PROCESSING METHOD IN AUTORADIOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A signal processing method in autoradiography em ploying a stimulable phosphor sheet for the purpose of obtaining information on one dimensional location of radioactively labeled substances distributed in at least one dimensional direction on a support medium, in the form of symbol, numeral or combination thereof, which comprises a process including 1 determining one dimensional scanning line for signal processing and 2 detecting sampling points on said scanning line, said process being applied to digital signal correspond ing to an autoradiograph having the locational information on the radioactively labeled substances, said digital signal being obtained by the use of the stimulable phosphor sheet.
