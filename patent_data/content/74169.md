# Micro biological production of muconic acid.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for microbiological oxidation of toluene to muconic acid. The toluene oxidation is achieved with novel strains of microorganisms e.g., Pseudomonas putida Biotype A which are capable of converting toluene to muconic acid quantitatively by the ortho Î² ketoadipate pathway. Muconate lactonising enzyme is not induced in the microorganism, thereby permitting the muconic acid to be produced and accumulated in a quantity greater than one gram of muconic acid per litre of conversion medium.
