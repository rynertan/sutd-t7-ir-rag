# MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY HAVING SPECIFICITY FOR THE DOUBLE STRANDED CONFORMATION OF NATIVE DNA AND DIAGNOSTIC METHODS USING SAME

## Abstract
Described are monoclonal antibodies having conforma tion dependent specificity for native dsDNA, as exemplified by the IgM antibody produced by murine hybridoma ATCC No. HB 8329, have been prepared. These antibodies may be bound to double stranded DNA to form immune complexes and thus are useful in immunodiagnostic tests to detect DNA duplex formation by DNA hybridization and to separate dsDNA from a solution containing it.
