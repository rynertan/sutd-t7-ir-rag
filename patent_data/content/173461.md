# Thermal diffusion fluid flow sensor.

## Abstract
A miniature solid state fluid flow sensor having a low dif fusivity substrate 10 , such as a polymer film, which is op tionally mounted on a thermally conductive base. A resistor strip 12 on the substrate is connected to an electrical oscillator 16 and thus emits thermal waves which are propagated through the fluid at a rate dependent on a fluid flow component perpendicular to the strip. A thermoelectric detector 20 , spaced from one side or each side of the strip, senses the thermal waves and detector circuitry 26, 28, 30, 31 de termines the time or phase shift due to fluid flow.
