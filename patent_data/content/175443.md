## Description
IMPROVED ALCOHOL RECOVERY PROCESS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the recovery of alcohols from concentrated aqueous acid streams. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Large volumes of alcohols are produced annually by the catalytic hydration of olefins, in which the selected olefin feed is absorbed in a concentrated aqueous sulfuric acid stream to form the corresponding alcohol and alkyl ester of the sulfuric acid. For example, the absorption of butene to form sec butanol and a sec butyl ester of.sulfuric acid can be illustrated by the following equation EMI1.1 Thereafter, water is admixed with the sulfuric acid stream withdrawn from the absorber to hydrolyze the ester and to facilitate alcohol recovery which is accomplished by stripping with steam There is thereby produced a diluted sulfuric acid stream which must for economic reasons be treated to concentrate it with respect to its sulfuric acid content, after which it is recycled to the olefin absorption step. The reconcentration of the diluted sulfuric acid stream is a very expensive and energy intensive process step, and a method whereby the alcohol could be recovered from the sulfuric acid stream withdrawn from the absorber, which did not require such a reconcentration, would be highly desirable. Processes have been proposed for alcohol recovery by extraction from such alcohol containing sulfuric acid streams by use of benzene, chloroform, ether, carbon bisulfide and toluene U.S. Patent 1,365,046 phenols, cresols, their homologues, ethers and phosphates U.S. Patent 2,139,953 and saturated hydrocarbons British Patent 493,884 . British Patent 506,473 relates to a method for production of organic oxy compounds from a mixture of two liquid phases containing the oxy compound distributed between the two layers in which the layers are separated and then recontacted at a lower temperature to extract the oxy compound from the more hydrophobic phase, e.g., a hydrocarbon phase. However, such extraction methods are not commercially desirable, since the solvent s extract very little alcohol if the acid strength of the alcoholcontaining sulfuric acid stream is greater than about 55 . Dilution of the acid stream to improve the ability of these solvents to extract the alcohol is.not economically practicable, since even more expense would be incurred in reconcentrating the resulting sulfuric acid recovered after the extraction prior to its being recycled to the olefin absorbing step. C. L. Munson et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Proc.Des. Dev., vol. 23, no. 1, pp. 109 115 1984 which is not admitted herein to be prior art investigated equilibrium distribution coefficients and separation factors for extraction of ethanol from dilute aqueous solutions of the alcohol by a number of different solvents and solvent mixtures, including extraction sol vents comprising neodecanoic acid and 2 ethyl hexanoic acid. An ethanol water extraction solvent phase is obtained and treated to dehydrate the ethanol, followed by fractionating the ethanol and solvent mixture. The dilute aqueous raffinate is separated from the extractor and treated, as by stripping, to separate extraction solvent dissolved in the raffinate. SaMmaY OF THE INVENTICrJ According to the process of the present invention, alcohols are recovered from aqueous mixtures thereof with a concentrated strong acid by contacting such alcohol containing aqueous concentrated acid mixtures with a carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of acids of the formula RCO2H wherein R is a straight or branched chain or cyclic alkyl of from 5 to 19 carbon atoms per molecule to form an extract phase containing said carboxylic acid in addition to said alcohol, and an aqueous raffinate phase depleted in said alcohol. It has been surprisingly found that the extraction solvents of this invention efficiently remove alcohol from concentrated aqueous strong acid solutions thereof and that the process permits recovery of this alcohol without substantial dilution of the aqueous strong acid. The alcohol can be recovered from the solution containing the alcohol together with the carboxylic acid extraction solvent by passing the alcohol solution to an alcohol vaporization zone, introducing a substantially anhydrous stripping gas to said alcohol vaporization zone in an amount and under conditions sufficient to form vapors comprising the alcohol and to form an alcohol depleted liquid phase comprising the carboxylic acid extraction solvent.Thus, the recovered strong aqueous acid raffinate, depleted in alcohol, can be readily recycled, for example, directly to an olefin absorption process for absorption of additional olef in. Further, it has been surprisingly found that the extraction solvents of this invention permit only minor amounts of water to pass into the extraction solvent phase so that alcohol can be recovered substantially free of water. Only minor quantities of the carboxylic acid extraction solvent have been found to pass into the aqueous raffinate in the process of this invention, thereby minimizing or avoiding the need to treat the raffinate for removal of the carboxylic acid extraction solvents. It has also been surprisingly found that open steam distillation or steam stripping of such alcoholcontaining carboxylic acid extraction solvent solutions results in a liquid phase from the stripping step in which the carboxylic acid extraction solvent contains significant levels of water, which is undesired in subsequent use of the carboxylic acid extraction solvent as recycled to an extraction zone in which the mono alcohol is sought to be removed from such aqueousstrong acid solutions.Therefore, while the advantages of open steam injection such as outstanding heat transfer capacity between the open steam, the alcohol sought to be vaporized, compatibility of the alcohol and steam, cheap and readily available sources of steam and steam injection apparatus, and the like would make this method the first choice of one seeking to recover the alcohol vapors, its disadvantage of passing significant levels of water to the liquid phase recovered from such a stream stripping zone are unexpected and unacceptably large. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of a rpior art process for indirect hydration of olefins using sulfuric acid, dilution of the sulfuric acid extract and stream stripping of the diluted acid for recovery of the alcohol vapors. Figure 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of one embodiment of the process of this invention. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a second embodiment of the cyclic process of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Prior Art Methods The prior art method of producing alcohols by hydrating the corresponding olefin can be illustrated by reference to Figure 1. An olef in, for example an aliphatic olefin having from 2 to 8, and more typically from 2 to 4, carbon atoms per molecule e.g., ethylene, propylene or butylene is fed as a gas or liquid via line 2 to an absorber 10 wherein it is contacted with and absorbed at least in part by a concentrated aqueous strong acid stream introduced via line 6, to form the corresponding alcohol and alkyl ester of the strong acid. The olefins to be hydrated can be obtained from any available source, such as the destructive distillation of carbonaceous materials, but warticularly from the cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons such as is practiced in the petroleum refining of mineral oils.The olefin can also be conventionally obtained by careful fractionation of cracked petroleum gases and is preferably substantially free of higher unsaturates, particularly diolef ins such as butadiene, etc. Illustrative of olefins which are employed are lower branched and straight chain alkenes i.e., alkenes of 2 to 6 carbon atoms , such as ethylene, propylene, the butylenes and the like. The strong acid used to absorb the olefin in absorber 10 also termed olefin hydration acid will generally comprise a strong organic or inorganic acid which is miscible with water and which is characterized by dissociation constants pK values in aqueous solutions of less than about 3.5. Examples of suitable inorganic olefin hydration acids are hydrofluoric acid, hydroiodic acid, hydrochloric acid, ortho phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid,. perchloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Sulfuric acid is especially preferred.Examples of suitable organic olefin hydration acids are chioroacetic acid, benzene sulfonic acid and the like. For convenience, the following discussion will be directed to the use of sulfuric acid, although it will be understood that any of the above strong acids could also be employed. The aqueous strong acid stream 6 which is used to absorb the selected olefin feed is a concentrated acid stream whose precise acid concentration will vary depending on the olefin which is employed, the strong acid selected, the temperatures of reaction and other conditions. For example, when sulfuric acid is used as the strong acid, stream 6 will generally contain from about 45 to 99 acid strength sulfuric acid for hydration of propylene and from about 55 to 85 acid strength sulfuric acid for reaction with butylene or higher olefin feeds. The temperature and pressure employed in absorber 10 generally also varies depending on the olefin, the acid concentration and other factors. Generally, a temperature of from about 20 to 1500C is used, and the pressure is sufficient to maintain the desired liquid phases in the absorber. Typically, for example, propylene is absorbed from a gas phase at a temperature of from about 90 to 1500C, and at a pressure of from about 100 500 psig. As illustrated, the olefin and sulfuric acid streams are contacted in a counter current fashion with the sulfuric acid stream being introduced into the upper portion of the absorber 10. Unabsorbed gases are withdrawn from the upper portion of absorber 10 via conduit 7 and can be recycled, if desired, to conduit 2 or can be subjected to conventional scrubbing washing treatment, as with caustic solutions. A product stream, comprising a sulfuric acid solution of the alcohol herein termed the absorber product stream , is withdrawn via line 4 from the lower portion of absorber 10.The absorber product stream can also contain the alkyl ester corresponding to the selected olef in, e.g., diethyl sulfate when ethylene is the olef in, and di isopropyl sulfate in the case of propylene hydration.The concentration of the alkyl ester in stream 4 can vary widely, and is generally from 15 to 30 wt. of the total alkyl ester mono and di alkyl ester in the case of lower alkenes e.g., propylene and butylene absorption. In the second step of the hydration process, water is conventionally added via line 12 to the absorber product stream 4 for hydrolysis of any alkyl ester and to form additional quantities of the corresponding alcohol, e.g., isopropanol from mono or di isopropyl sulfate. The manner in which the water and absorber product stream are contacted varies, and the art employs a variety of such methods, including 1 in line addition of water as illustrated , with a provision for a suitable length of conduit to provide adequate mixing and reaction time, and 2 contacting of the absorber product stream and water in a separate reaction vessel with agitation not shown . The amount of water which is added to the absorber product stream also varies widely. Generally, sufficient water is added in order to reduce the acid strength to from 45 to 55 sulfuric acid. These reduced acid strengths are desired to permit subsequent recovery of the alcohol by steam stripping. Typically, from about 0.2 to 0.5 parts by weight of water is added per part by weight of the absorber product stream. The diluted stream thus formed generally contains from about 45 to 55 wt. sulfuric acid, and is then passed via line 4 to distillation column 20, herein termed the alcohol generator, wherein crude alcohol is recovered as an overhead product via line 18 by steam stripping. The overhead alcohol product can then be passed to further conventional processing to produce alcohol of the required purity. A bottoms product is withdrawn, from alcohol generator 20 via line 28 and comprises a sulfuric acid stream which generally. contains from about 40 to 55 wt. sulfuric acid. In conventional process, the alcohol generator bottoms 28 are passed directly to another distillation column 30, hereinafter termed the acid concentrator , wherein this acid stream is distilled e.g., by use of a steam heat exchanger 34 and reboiled stream 37 for removal of water as overhead 32 and to form a second bottoms product 38 comprising a reconcentrated acid stream. These concentrated bottoms are generally cooled in cooler 40 and passed to storage tank 50 for ultimate recycle to the absorption step 10, with addition of make up acid 5, as required. Present Invention Referring to Figure 2, it has been surprisingly found that alcohols can be efficiently and quickly recovered by contacting a concentrated aqueous strong acid solution thereof 104 herein termed the acid alcohol feedstream with an effective amount of an extraction solvent 166 selected from the group consisting of alicyclic and acyclic alkyl carboxylic acids having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule. The carboxylic acids which are employed as extraction solvents 166 in the process of this invention therefore comprise at least one member selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acids of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R is an alicyclic or acyclic alkyl group having from 5 to 19 carbon atoms. When R is acyclic alkyl, the alkyl group can be straight or branched chain. The R group can be substituted with nonreactive groups such as fluoro and chloro.Examples of such R groups are pentyl, hexyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, undecyl, 2 ethylhexyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl and fluoro and chloro substituted derivatives of the foregoing. A preferred class of carboxylic acid extraction solvents for use in this invention comprise saturated acids, and especially saturated hindered acids wherein the carboxyl groups are sterically blocked or hindered. The discussion of steric hindrance may be found in Newman, Steric Effects in Organic Chemistry, 1956, pp. 204 207. Generally, steric hindrance results from the presence of tertiary or quaternary alpha, beta or gamma carbon atoms in the acid, increasing substitution leading to increased hindrance. Steric hindrance has been observed to tend to prevent esterification of the carboxylic acid with the alcohol. A class of particularly preferred sterically hindered carboxylic acids are the neo acids neo is used to denote a carbon atom that is bonded to four other carbon atoms, e.g., as in neo hexanoic acid, L.e. 2,2 dimethyl butanoic acid . Thus, the preferred neo acids can be represented by members selected from the group consisting of acids having the formula II EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different and are independently selected from the group consisting of cyclic and alicyclic alkyl of from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, with the proviso that the neo acid contains a total of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, and preferably from 7 to 15 carbon atoms per molecule. The alicyclic alkyl groups can be straight or branched. A preferred class of neo acids are those wherein, referring to formula II above R1 and R2 are preferably each alkyl radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms per radical and R3 is preferably alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that the neo acid has a total of at least 6, and preferably at least 7, carbon atoms per molecule. Some typical examples of neo acids are 2,2 dimethyl butanoic acid alpha, alpha dimethyl ct cylohexyl acetic acid alpha, alpha dimethtl octanoic acid l methyl 4 propylcyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid and the like. Commercial neo acids which comprise a mixture of isomers, all with the neo structure formula II , such as neo heptanoic acid, neo octanoic acid, neononanoic acid, neo decanoic acid and neo tridecanoic acid, are especially useful and preferred in the process of this invention. The preparation and properties of the commercial carboxylic acids are described in N.Fefer and A. Rutkouski, J. Am. Oil Chemists Soc., 45, 5 1968 . Neo acids can also be prepared by the well known Koch process from carbon monoxide, water and typeII, III, IV or V olefins as described by H. Koch inBrenntstaff Chem., 36, 321 1955 . Further details on methods for making neo acids can be found in BritishPatent 998,974 and U.S. Patent 3,349,107, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Neo acids are often made from branched chain olefin feedstocks which are random isomeric mixtures in regard to the position of the olefinic bond. These acids are thus random isomeric mixtures of neo acids. These neo acids are suitable in their isomeric forms, or any suitable mix tures thereof may be employed. The carboxylic acid extraction solvent of this invention may be used alone or as mixtures with a cosolvent for the selected alcohol, such as a C10 to C20 paraffinic hydrocarbon, a C7 to C12 aromatic hydrocarbon, or a C1 to ClO alkyl ester of a C4 to Cls monocarboxylic acid. When used, such additional cosolvents will be generally employed in such mixtures in an amount of less than about 45 wt. of the carboxylic acid cosolvent mixture. In particular, it has been observed that the carboxylic acid extraction solvents of this invention, when contacted with alcohol and concentrated aqueous acid, will form the corresponding carboxylic ester of the alcohol, albeit at a rate which varies depending on the particular carboxylic acid extraction solvent selected for use.For example, steric hindrance in the carboxylic acid, especially the neo structures Structure II will tend to reduce the rate and equilibrium constant of the esterification reaction. Eventually, the thus formed ester of the carboxylic acid extraction solvent will build up to approximately a steady state concentration in the continuous process in which the carboxylic acid extraction solvent is repeatedly recycled to extract additional quantities of alcohol from the alcohol containing concentrated aqueous acid feedstream as will be described in more detail below . The selected carboxylic acid extraction solvent of this invention may be contacted with the acid alcohol feedstream in extraction zone 160 in any conven ient manner, including continuous, semi continous or batchwise operations, in a single or in multiple extraction stages. The concentration of the strong acid e.g., sulfuric acid in acid alcohol feedstreams 104 herein termed the acid strength or A.S. to be so contacted, can vary widely and will typically range from about 40 to 80 wt. sulfuric acid, preferably from about 50 to 65 wt. sulfuric acid when a neo acid is employed as the extracting solvent. As used herein, the acid strength in the acid alcohol feedstream is defined herein on an organic free basis, as follows using H2SO4 as the acid for purposes of illustration EMI11.1 wherein W1 is the weight of strong acid, W2 is the weight of H20, W3 is the weight of alcohol, W4 is the weight of the mono alkyl ester of the strong acid,M3 is the molecular weight of the alcohol M1 is the molecular weight of the strong acid, and M5 is the molecular weight of the olefin. Also, the concentrations of the alcohol and alkyl ester in the stream 104 can vary widely, and the saturated monoalcohol concentration will generally range from about 5 to 50 wt. and preferably from about 10 to 40 wt. and the saturated alcohol alkyl ester of the strong acid will generally range from. about 1 to 15 wt. , and preferably from about 1 to 5 wt. , of total alkyl ester mono and di alkyl ester . The amount of carboxylic acid extraction solvent which is used to contact the acid alchol feedstream can also vary widely. Preferably, the carboxylic acid extraction solvent of this invention and the acid alcohol feedstream are contacted in zone 160 in a ratio of from about 0.3 to 5 parts by weight of the carboxylic acid per part by weight of the acid alcohol feedstream. The temperature and pressure in zone 160 in which such extraction is performed using the carboxylic acid solvents of this invention is not critical, and will vary widely depending upon the particular carboxylic acid solvent employed, the degree of efficiency of removal desired for the alcohol, phase settling time desired, and other factors. Generally, however, temperatures within the range from about 25 to 100 C, preferably from about 25 to 800C, can be used, and the pressure can be atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric, with pressures of from about 13.8 to 689.5 kPa 2 to 100 psig being typically suitable.Similarly, the time for the contacting of the selected carboxylic acid solvent of this invention and the acid alcohol feedstream is not critical and can vary widely, but will typically fall within the range of from about 0.1 to 6 hours. Finally, the process of this invention can employ as extraction zone 160, in which the extraction with carboxylic acid solvent is carried out, any of the conventional equipment which are employed for liquid liquid extractions. For example, the solvent and the acid alcohol feedstream can be introduced as a combined stream inta a stirred tank, and the resulting liquids passed to a settling drum from which the light phase alcohol solvent phase and the heavy phase lean acid alcohol phase can be recovered. Alternatively, the contacting zone can comprise a static plate extraction column either packed or trayed column , a reciprocating plate column such as the KARTS column , stirred columns such as YORK SCHIEBEL columns and the like. In the process of this invention, water may be added to the acid alcohol feedstream 104 in order to provide the water of hydration for formation of the selected alcohol from alkyl ester corresponding to the alcohol. This water can be introduced via stream 112 into the conduit carrying the acid alcohol feedstream 104 as illustrated, or the water can be introduced into zone 160 itself. Generally, from about 0.04 to 0.4 parts by weight of water are added per part by weight of the acid alcohol feedstream. An alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract stream 162 can be thus separated and recovered as the light phase from extraction zone 160, either directly from zone 160 as illustrated or following treatment of a two phase mixture removed from the contacting zone to a conventional phase separation vessel. This alcohol rich carboxylic extract 162 generally contains from about 5 to 20 wt. alcohol and from about 95 to 45 wt. of the carboxylic acid solvent. The alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 will only contain a minor proportion of water, preferably less than about 2 wt. water, more preferably less than about 1 wt. water, and most preferably less than about 0.3 wt. water.In addition, it has been found that the carboxylic acid extraction solvents of this invention permit recovery of such a alcohol rich stream without, at the same time, contamination with significant amounts of the strong acid or alkyl ester of the strong acid.Generally, the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 recovered from the contacting zone contains less than about 1 wt. , most preferably less than about 0.3 wt. , of such alkyl esters and is substantially free of the strong acid, that is, contains less than 0.1 wt. and most preferably less than 0.01 wt. , of the strong acid e.g., H2SO4 . A second phase 168 can also be recovered, again either directly or indirectly, from the extraction zone 160 as the heavy phase and comprises a mixture of water, strong acid and alkyl moieties, either as the mono ester or di ester of the strong acid or the alcohol, or mixtures thereof, enriched in the strong acid. This separated strong acid enriched phase 168 can be recycled to an olefin absorbing zone 110, after addition of make up strong acid 105, if required. Generally, this strong acid phase 168 separated from the extraction zone 160 will contain strong acids in an acid strength of at least 1 wt. , and preferably from about 2 to 10 wt. greater than the acid strength of the strong acid in the diluted acid alcohol feedstream 117 passed to extraction zone 160. Preferably, the extraction process of this invention is performed by continuously passing the acid alcohol feedstream 117 and the carboxylic acid extraction solvent 166 to the extraction zone 160 countercurrently, and at flow rates such that the strong acid phase, that is the acid alcohol feedstream 117, is the discontinuous phase and is introduced to the upper portion of the extraction tower 160, with the extraction solvent phase comprising the continuous phase. It has been found that such an embodiment greatly reduces the time required fdr phase separations to occur during the. extraction. The manner in which the acid alcohol feedstream 104 is formed is not critical to this invention.When feedstream 104 is formed by absorption of olefin into a strong acid, any of the prior art methods and absorption apparatus can be used, as described above. Therefore, in one embodiment of the process of this invention, feedstream 104 can be formed by passing an olefin stream 102 to conventional absorbing zone 110 for countercurrent contact therein with a concentrated strong acid stream 106. Olefin 102 can comprise any of the above mentioned aliphatic olefins having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule, and particularly olefins having 3 or 4 carbon atoms per molecule. Similarly, the identity and concentration of the strong acid in acid stream 106, the temperature and pressure and other conditions used in absorbing zone 110 correspond to those which have been discussed earlier.Therefore, when the olefin comprises propylene, and the strong acid is sulfuric acid, stream 106 will generally comprise sulfuric acid of an acid strength of from about 45 to 99 , more preferably from about 50 to 80 , and when the olefin 102 comprises butylene or higher olefin feeds., stream 106 will generally comprise sulfuric acid of an acid strength of from about 45 to 85 wt. and more preferably from about 55 to 80 wt. .Generally, a temperature of from about 20 to 1500C and a pressure of fran about 413.7 to 3,448kPa 60 to 500 psig will be used. Further, any of the above discussed strong acids can be employed., and such acids will generally comprise a strong organic or inorganic acid which is miscible with water and which is characterized by dissociation constants pK values in aqueous solutions of less than about 3.5. Examples of suitable inorganic olefin hydration acids are hydrofluoric acid, hydroiodic acid, hydrochloric acid, ortho phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, perchloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Sulfuric acid is especially preferred.Examples of suitable organic olefin hydration acids re chloroacetic acid, benzene sulfonic acid and. the like. Unabsorbed gases are withdrawn from the upper portion of absorbing zone 110 via conduit 107 and can be recycled if desired to conduit 102 or subjected to conventional scrubbing washing treatment, as with caustic solutions. Therefore, the alcohols recovered by the process of this invention comprise the alcohol corresponding to the olefinEs fed to the absorbing zone 110, and generally comprise saturated mono alcDhols having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule, and preferably having 3 or 4 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of such alcohols are n butanpl, iso butanol, secbutanol, tert butyl alcohol, n propanol, iso propanol, pentanols, hexanols and octanols. As used herein, the term extract saturation i.e., E.S. values of strong acid solutions, containi alcohol and or alkyl ester of the strong acid, is defined by the expression III E.S. X1 III XA wherein xl is the mole fraction of alcohol and alcohol equivalents represented by the alkyl esters absorbed in the liquid and XA is the mole fraction in the liquid of the strong acid and strong acid moieties of the strong acid esters. The alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 can then be treated by steam stripping or by the further improvement method of the present invention for recovery of the alcohol therefrom and for recovery and separation of the carboxylic acid solvent for recycle, if desired, to the extraction zone 160 in order to extract additional quantities of alcohol therein.According to theimpre alcohol separation method of this ition, the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 is passed to an alcohol vaporization zone wherein stream 162 is contacted with substantially anhydrous stripping vapors under conditions sufficient to form an overhead vapor product comprising at least a majority that is, at least 50 wt. of the alcohol introduced to the alcohol vaporization zone with extract 162 and preferably from about 70 to 95 wt. of the thus introduced alcohol and substantially free of the carboxylic acid extraction solvent and to form a bottoms product comprising an alcohol depleted carboxylic acid stream which is preferably suitable for recycle to an alcohol extraction zone, as described above. The alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 can be treated in the alcohol vaporization zone by distillation, flashing or stripping using a substantially anhydrous gas which is substantially inert to the alcohol and to the carboxylic acid under stripping conditions. Suitable stripping gases include N2, olefins and saturated hydrocarbons, with mono olefins of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and alkanes of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms being preferred. Therefore, the alcohol vaporization zone can comprise one or more flashing zones, distillation zones, gas stripping zones or combinations of the foregoing. The introduction of steam into the alcohol carboxylic acid mixture is preferably avoided, since it has been found that the carboxylic acid s affinity for water is greatly increased in the absence of sulfuric acid.Thus, it has been found that if open steam distillation or stripping were used, while alcohol vapors could be stripped overhead, the bottoms stream from such a steam stripper would comprise an aqueous carboxylic acid mixture which when recycled to the liquid liquid extraction zone would tend to build water in the system, and thereby decrease the efficiency of reconcentration of sulfuric acid as discussed above. Since low selectivity for water absorbtion by the carboxylic acid solvent in the liquid liquid extraction zone 160 is critical, the introduction of steam or water vapor into the alcohol vaporization zone via open steam distillation or steam stripping should be avoided.Also, it has been found that alcohol water carboxylic acid extraction solvent mixtures can present settling problems in recovering alcohol and or the carboxylic acid solvent therefrom, when such steam distillation or steam stripping methods are attempted. According to one embodiment of the process of this invention, illustrated in Figure 2, the separated alcohol enriched carboxylic acid extract phase162 is heated e.g., using heat exchanger 167 to a temperature of from about 0 to 2000C.higher than the temperature employed in extraction zone 160, and the resulting heated alcohol enriched stream 165 is flashed into a vapor liquid separation zone 170 such as a suitable vapor liquid separating drum at a lower pressure in order to effect vaporization of at least a majority of the alcohol and thereby permit recovery of alcohol vapors 172 from this flashing zone 170.A lean solvent phase comprising the carboxylic acid extraction solvent can be withdrawn from flashing zone 170 via conduit 166 and recycled to extraction zone 160, after addition of make up carboxylic acid extraction solvent 169, if required. Alternatively, if the pressure in flashing zone 170 is sufficiently low, the use of heater 167 can be eliminated and stream 162 can be passed to zone 170 directly. The conditions of temperature and pressure which are employed in flashing zone 170 for alcohol recovery will vary widely depending upon the alcohol to be recovered, the particular carboyxlic acid extraction solvent which is used, and other factors.Generally, however, flashing zone 170 should employ a temperature of from about 30 to 2000C, preferably from about 60 to 1500C, as determined in flashfeed stream 165 for recovery of alcohols of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Preferably, the carboxylic acid extraction solvent which is used in this invention possesses a normal boiling point of at least about 100 Ci more preferably at least about 140 0C, greater than the normal boiling point of the alcohol in order to permit more efficient separation of the alcohol vapors 172 without, at the sqme time, contaminating the thus separated vapors with significant quantities of the carboxylic acid solvent itself. The conditions of pressure which are used in flashing zone 170 will, of course, have an effect on the necessary temperatures to recover the alcohol by flashing, but generally, the pressure in the flashing zone 172, will range from about 13.8 to l,Q34kPa 2 to 150 psia2, and more preferably from about 34.5 to 345kPa C5 to 50 psia . According to another embodiment of the process of this invention, the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 can be distilled in a conventional distillation column not shown provided with a reboiler, whereby at least a portion of, the bottoms product is reboiled by indirect heat exchange with a heating fluid e.g., steam and the thus heated stream is reintroduced into the lower portion of the distillation column typically below the feed point in the column to which the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract liquid stream is introduced . The alcohol vapors are withdrawn as the overhead product, and if desired can be at least partially condensed to form a liquid reflux to the upper portion of the column. According to yet another and preferred embodiment of the process of this invention, illustrated in Figure 3, the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract 162 is passed to stripping zone 180 optionally, after heating stream 162 in heater 167, as described above wherein the extract liquid is stripped by means of a stripping gas 184 which is introduced to the lower portion of stripping zone 180, to form a vapor ous overhead product stream 182 and a liquid bottoms product 166. Overhead product 180 which comprises at least a majority of the feed alcohol, as described above, and which also contains the stripping gas, can be cooled in cooler 185 to condense the alcohol vapors.The resulting gas liquid stream 186 can be passed to a vapor liquid separation drum 192, to permit separation and withdrawal of uncondensed vapors 188, comprising the stripping gas, and a liquid alcohol stream 190, which can be withdrawn and subjected to further purification, if desired. A portion of liquid alcohol stream 190 can be passed via conduit 189 as liquid reflux to stripping zone 180. The bottoms product 166 comprises the alcohol depleted carboxylic acid stream and can be recycled to extractor 160 with the addition of make up carboxylic acid via conduit 169, as required for extraction of additional quantities of the alcohol. As described earlier, stripping gas 184 comprises a substantially anhydrous gas which is substantially inert to the alcohol and to the carboxylic acid under stripping conditions. Suitable stripping gases include N2, mono olefins of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and alkanes of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Preferably, stripping gas 184 comprises a mono olefin, alkane or mixture thereof corresponding to the mono alcohol sought to be stripped from extract 162. A particularly preferred source of such an olefin stripping gas 184 in the off gas stream 107 removed from the overhead of olefin absorbing zone 110. The conditions of temperature and pressure which are employed in stripping zone 180 for alcohol recovery will vary widely depending upon the alcohol to be recovered, the particular carboxylic acid extraction solvent which is used, and other factors. Generally, however, stripping zone 180 will employ a temperature of from about 30 to 200it, preferably from about 60 to l50ic as determined in the feed stream 165 , for recovery of mono alcohols of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms.Preferably, the carboxylic acid extraction solvent which is used in this invention possesses a normal boiling point of at least 100C, more preferably at least about 140 C, greater than the normal boiling point of the alcohol in order to permit more efficient separation of the alcohol vapors 182 without, at the same time, contaminating the thus separated vapors with significant quantities of the carboxylic acid solvent itself. The conditions of pressure which are used in stripping zone 180 can also vary widely but will generally range from about 13.8 to 1t,034kPa 2 to 150 asia and more preferably from about 34.5 to 345kPa 5 to 50 psia . The alcohol depleted carboxylic acid stream 166 formed as described above preferably contain the carboxylic acid in a concentration at least as great as and more preferably from about 1.01 to 1.15 times greater than the concentration of the carboxylic acid in the alcohol rich carboxylic acid extract stream 162 which was treated in the alcohol vaporization zone according to the process of this invention. In addition, alcohol depleted carboxylic acid stream 166 preferably contains water in a concentration of less than about 1 wt. , and more preferably less than about 0.5 wt. , most preferably less than about 0.2 wt. . The overhead alcohol vapors e.g., t62 or 182 withdrawn from the vaporization zone of this invention preferably contain less than about 2 wt. of the carboxylic acid extraction solvent, and comprise at least 50 wt. and preferably from about 70 to 95 wt. of the liquid alcohol feed to the alcohol vaporization zone. It will be understood from the foregoing that the anhydrous stripping vapors employed herein to separate the alcohol comprise either 1 internally generated vapors when either the aforedescribed flashing method or the rebvoiling distillation method is employed or 2 a separate stripping gas, e.g., the olefin vapors withdrawn from an olefin extractor 110, and that such vapors gases are deemed herein to be anhydrous if they do not contain water not introduced to the vaporization zone with the liquid alcohol feed thereto.For example, if such internally generated stripping vapor, are generated in a reboiled distillation column, the bottoms product which is reboiled to provide heat to the distillation column may contain water in an amount corresponding to the vapor liquid equilbria of the distillation system s last lowest theoretical vapor liquid contacting stage. Therefore, the reintroduction of such reboiled steam into the distillation column will not introduce water into the column in amounts in excess of that passed to the column with the liquid alcohol feed. Similarly, when the stripping vapors are generated by flashing, a portion of the water content of the liquid alcohol feed will also generally vaporize, but such water is indigeneous and the resulting vapors are nevertheless anhydrous stripping vapors under the above definition.Finally, if a separate stripping gas 184 is used, preferably this gas stream is substantially water free, that is contains less than about 10 wt. water, and more preferably less than about 5 wt. water. Gas chromatograph analyses were performed in theExamples using a known amount of methyl isobutyl carbonyl MIBC as internal standard. The sample was injected into aHP 5880A GC with a 60 meter SE 30 capillary column. The oven temperature was initially at 40 C for 4 minutes then temperature program at 5 min to 2000C. The injection port and detector temperatures were 225 and 330 C, respectively.Water content was analyzed using a 1 8 x 10 Porapak N column at 175iC isothermal column temperature with thermo conductivity detector. In the Examples, sulfuric acid concentrations are expressed as acid strength , i.e., A.S. values defined above , unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of butene, secondary butyl ether SBE , sec butyl alcohol SBOH , butyl ester of sulfuric acid BuHSO4 sulfuric acid, and water was prepared in the selected amounts and passed as an acid alcohol feedstream having an acid strength of 55 wt. H2SO4 and an extract saturation value of 1.0 to the upper portion of a continuous Karr extraction unit comprising a reciprocating plate column total liquid holdup equals 650 cc. and contacted therein with a selected amount of neo decanoic acid which was passed to the reciprocating plate column at the lower portion thereof. The liquids thus passed to the extraction unit were preheated each to a temperature of 600C. The reciprocating plate column was provided with a hot water heating jacket maintained at 600C.The upper portion of the extraction unit column was provided with a phase separator whereby a light phase , comprising the neodecanoic acid and extracted sec butyl alcohol values, were accumulated and withdrawn for analysis.From the bottom portion of the column, a heavy phase , comprising the alcohol depleted sulfuric acid stream, was also withdrawn and collected, for analysis. The liquids thereby accumulated were each analyzed by gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy NMR for component identification. The heavy phase was found to have a 60 percent acid strength, compared to the 55 percent acid strength of the feedstream to the extraction column. The data thereby obtained are set forth inTable I.

Batchwise Preparation of Acid Alcohol Feedstreams Containing Absorbed Olefin A sulfuric acid stream containing absorbed butylene values was prepared by charging 400 cc. of sulfuric acid of the selected strength from 50 to 75 wt. H2SO4 to a one liter baffled Hastelloy C autoclave equipped with a flat blade turbine stirrer and an olefin gas sparger for sparging directly into the liquid phase under the stirrer. The autoclave was also provided with thermocouples to measure the liquid reaction medium temperature, and was provided with an electric heating mantle and cold water cooling coil for temperature control. After the charged sulfuric acidwas heated to the selected reaction temperature, the butylene gas feed, preheated to the reaction temperature, was sparged to the liquid sulfuric acid at the selected gas feed rate.Unabsorbed gases were continuously withdrawn from the autoclave, and the absorbed butylene was accumulated in the reactor until the desired extract saturation ES value was obtained. Thereafter, the thus formed acid alcohol feedstreams are contacted with the selected amount of a carboxylic acid solvent of this invention, and the results thereby obtained are reported in the associated tables below. EXAMPLE 8 The above batchwise procedure for preparing an acid alcohol feedstream was followed to obtain an ES value of 0.5 and sulfuric acid A.S. value of 56.7 . In a series of runs, separate portions of the acid alcohol feedstreams were contacted with the indicated amount of octanoic acid for extraction of sec butyl alcohol SBA therefrom using the indicated contacting temperatures, employing a 60 ml. separatory funnel, with agitation, and employing 3 hours of settling time. The weight percent sec butyl alcohol in the light phase i.e., the upper layer comprising the octanoic acid layer was then analyzed. The data thereby obtained are set forth in Table 8 below.

EXAMPLE 10 The procedure of Example 9 was repeated except that the solvent feed ratio for each extraction solvent of this invention was varied to determine the effect of solvent to feed ratio on the selectivity of extraction, such extraction selectivity being determined as the weight ratio of water to secondary butyl alcohol in the upper layer. All runs were conducted using a 250C contacting temperature, an A.S. value of 56.7 and an extract saturation value of 0.5. The data thereby obtained are set forth in Table 10. These data indicate that solvent to feed ratio has a pronounced, non linear effect on the selec tivity for alcohol extraction, with increasing amounts of water being removed together with the acid solvent, for example, in the case of octanoic acid, as the solvent to feed ratio is increased above about 0.5. In contrast, a high selectivity for alcohol extraction and, concurrently the lower selectivity for water removal is achieved using neoheptanoic and neodecanoic acids at solvent to feed ratios of from 1.0 1 to 2.0 1 vol vol .

The results thereby obtained are set forth in Table 11. Therefore, it has been found that the capacity for alcohol removal of neodecanoic acid was greatly increased at both the 250C and 600C contacting temperatures by decreasing the weight percent sulfuric acid in the acid alcohol feedstreams. The data inTable 11 also indicate that increasing acid strengths resulted in a greatly increased amount of butylene regenerated in the upper layer containing the neodecanoic acid solvent, particularly when the acid alcohol feedstream had an A.S. value of greater than about 60 . Therefore, it can be seen that if the acid strength of the acid alcohol feedstream is not greater than about 60 A.S., then the regenerated olefin in the light phase will comprise less than about S wt. of the alcohol present in the acid alcohol feedstream treated by use of the process of this invention.In contrast, conventional steam stripping methods for alcohol recovery from an absorber product stream generally result in regenerated olefin of above 15 25 wt. of the alcohol contained in the absorber product stream.

The concentration of neodecanoic acid in a heavy phase was then determined to assess the solubility of neodecanoic acid therein as a function of extract saturation values. The data thereby obtained are set forth in Table 12. From these data it can be seen that, at each acid strength level tested, the solubility of neodecanoic acid in the heavy phase which comprise the depleted sulfuric acid solution increases as the ES value of the feed extract increases, and that best results were obtained that is lowest concentration of the neodecanoic acid in the heavy layer were achieved when the ES value in the feed extract was less than about 0.4.

Referring to Figure 1, the prior art method of alcohol recovery, it can be shown by calculations that an absorber product stream 4 having an acid strength AS of 71 and an extract saturation ES value of 1.2 and therefore comprising 47.75 wt. H2SO4, 32.74 wt. butylene equivalents and 19.51 wt. water requires 19.56 grams of additional water be added, per 100 grams of the absorber product stream 4, in order to reduce the acid concentration to an acid strength A.S. of 55 . The subsequent steam stripping of this diluted acid stream for alcohol recovery provides a depleted sulfuric acid stream which must be reconcentrated to 71 A.S. before recycle to the absorber 10. In contrast, referring to Figure 2, the process of the present invention, to achieve a 55 A.S.after addition of water 112 to the same absorber product stream 104, can efficiently recover the alcohol using a 60 A.S. and ES of 1.0 in the absorber product stream, and only about 6.8 grams of water, per 100 grams of absorber product stream 104, is required to be added in diluting this stream to the desired 55 A.S.level. EXAMPLES 14 21 The following runs were made to illustrate our discovery of a major and unexpected difference in solution behavior in the partitioning of alcohol into a neo acid extraction solvent of this invention from aqueous alcohol, neo acid mixtures free of sulfuric acid as compared to that observed for such mixtures which also comprise sulfuric acid. A series of extractions were performed using the method of Example 8 upon acid alcohol feedstreams prepared as in Example 8, using the sulfuric acid concentrations, butylene concentrations and other conditions set forth in Tables 13 and 14 below, which also summarizes the data thereby obtained. As can be seen from Tables 13 and 14 the extent of removal of water from the alcohol containing feeds using neodecanoic acid as the extraction solvent was surprisingly far less when the feed comprised aqueous sec butanol sulfuric acid mixtures Examples 14 21 than when the feed comprised aqueous sec butanol alone Comparative Examples 1 IX .

EXAMPLE 22 A series of experiments were performed to illustrate the benefits found in practice of the process of this invention by contacting the acid alcohol feedstream with a carboxylic acid extraction solvent of this invention in a manner in which the acid alcohol feedstream comprised. the discontinuous phase in the extraction zone. A 150 cc glass tube was charged with 60 cc of a mixture comprising the selected proportion of an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of the indicatedA.S. and E.S. values, containing sec butyl alcohol, and neodecanoic acid, as the extraction solvent. The mixture was heated to a temperature of 600C at atmospheric pressure by heating the glass tube in an oil bath, and the mixture was then shaken for 10 seconds to thoroughly mix the liquid phases.The shaking was stopped and the liquid mixture was observed to determine the time required to form a liquid liquid interface between the upper phase the alcohol containing neodecanoic acid extract phase and the lower phase the alcohol depleted sulfuric acid phase . These times are reported as break times in Table 15 below. As can be seen from Table 55, the extraction runs in which the carboxylic acid extraction solvent comprised the continuous liquid phase Runs l B through 6 B effected a breaktime greatly decreased from those observed in Runs 1 A through 6 A, respectively, for the extractions in which the carboxylic acid extraction solvent comprised the dispersed liquid phase, that is the discontinuous liquid phase. Therefore, the extraction process of this invention is preferably performed in a manner in which the acid alcohol feedstream is the discontinuous liquid phase in the extraction zone.

It will be understood frort the foregoing that while the alcohol recovery method of this invention has been particularly described with regard to alcohol recovery from acid alcohol feedstreams produced by absorbing olefins into concentrated strong acids, the method of this invention may be employed for recovery of alcohol from such acid alcohol. mixtures produced by different processes, either as product or by product streams. EXAMPLE 23 A mixture of butene, secondary butyl ether SBE , secondary butyl alcohol SBOH and neo decanoic acid NDA was prepared in the selected amounts and continuously passed as feed to the eighth tray of a ten tray distillation column 1 inch Oldershaw . A preheated stripping gas, comprising butenes, was continuously charged below the first tray of the column. The liquid feed thus passed to the extraction unit was preheated to the selected temperature. The distillation column was provided with a vacuum jacket, and the upper portion of the column was provided with a partial condenser to partially condense the overhead product and phase separator to separate the condensed sec butyl alcohol from uncondensed gases, including the butenes. The bottoms product comprised the neo decanoic acid depleted in alcohol.The liquids thereby obtained were each analyzed by gas chromotography and nuclear magnetic resonance for component identification. The data data thereby obtained are set forth in Table I. The partially condensed liquids obtained from the overhead products in this distillation was found to contain 11.05 wt. dissolved butenes, 82.21 wt. SBOH, 0.22 wt. SBE, 5.37 wt. water and 1.15 wt. NDA. EXAMPLE 24 The procedure of Example 23 is repeated employing the conditions set forth in Table 17. The recovered liquid condensate, separated from the overhead product stream, was found to contain 10.12 wt. butens, 82.78 wt. SBOH, 0.25 wt. SBE, 4.87 wt. water, and 1.98 wt. NDA. EXAMPLE 25 The procedure of Example 23 is repeated employing the conditions set forth in Table 18 The recovered liquid condensate, separated from the overhead product stream, was found to contain 13.31 wt. but enes, 80.69 wt. SBOH, 0.28 wt. SBE, 4.64 wt. water, and 1.08 wt. NDA. EXAMPLE 26 FOR COMPARISON The procedure of Example 23 is. repeated except that the stripping gas containing butenes also contains water, in a concentration of about 7.4 wt. . The results thereby obtained are set forth in Table 19 . These results indicate that the liquid condensate following partial condensation contained 2.18 wt. butenes, 82.08 wt. SBOH, 9.96 wt. water, and 5.77 wt. NDA. This indicates the significantly increased water concentrations in the desired SBOH product and the increased NDA content of this SBOH product stream, which results when the stripping gas contains significant levels of water. EXAMPLE 27 FOR COMPARISON A series of runs were conducted using the procedure of Example 23 except the stripping gas comprised steam, using the selected steam feed pressure and temperatures indicated in Tables 20 and 21 below. The data thereby obtained illustrate the undesirability of recovering the secondary butyl alcohol by steam stripping. In these runs a significant concentration of the NDA solvent was noted in the overhead product. In addition, it was observed that the bottoms product withdrawn from the stripping column contained high amounts of.. water and resulted in a two phase bottoms product which had very poor settling qualities. The organic phase of this bottoms product comprised the NDA solvent layer However, its high water content rendered that the phase undesirable for recycle to an extraction process wherein the SBOH is desired to be extracted using the NDA from an aqueousSBOH sulfuric acid solution, wherein dilution of the resulting alcohol depleted sulfuric acid is desirably avoided. Thus, although high alcohol recoveries can be achieved using steam stripping, as is illustrated by Table 21, the water content of the separated bottoms product organic phase is unacceptably great.
