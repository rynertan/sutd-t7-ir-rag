# Method for browning foods in a microwave oven.

## Abstract
A method for effectively browning foods in a microwave oven by controlling the humidity of the cooking environment. Humidity and temperature sensors are provided to measure the relative humidity of the environment surrounding a foodstuff to be browned as the food is cooked by microwave energy. The actual sensed conditions are compared with a predetermined optimum relative humidity. Adjustments to the relative humidity are then made by either increasing or decreasing the air exchange rate, or by increasing or decreasing the amount of heat added to the air exchanged, or both.
