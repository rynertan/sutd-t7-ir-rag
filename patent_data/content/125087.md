# Windshear detection and warning system.

## Abstract
Windshear warning apparatus which separately com pares a plurality of inertial derived 34 36 and air data derived 47 acceleration signals which under normal wind conditions are substantially equal but under windshear conditions will be significantly different and used to indicate incipient wind shear. Also, a signal proportional to the product of the mag nitude and rate of change of the total or resultant inertial acceleration of the aircraft is used to provide a warning 52 of a significant windshear condition.
