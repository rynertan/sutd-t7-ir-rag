## Abstract
A method for determining tumor associated glucose side chain TAG in the body fluid of mammals, a method for diagnosing tumors through the determination, and a kit for diagnosis of tumors. TAG specifically existing in the body fluid of a patient suffering from a tumor is reacted with lectin to form a TAG lectin combination entity. The amount of the combination entity or of the remaining is measured to ascertain the presence or absence of tumor cells, the degree of cell growth and the vicissitudes of the cells, thus diagnosing a tumor. The use of a kit containing vegetable lectin and, in some cases, a stabilizer and or a preservative is particularly convenient for determination of TAG.

## Description
Specification DETERMINATION OF TUMOR ASSOCIATED GLYCOLINKAGE DIAGNOSIS OF CANCERS AND KITS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF CANTERS Technical Field This invention relates to determination of the level of tumor associated glycolinkage containing substances, i.e., sugar related substances including glycoproteins, glycopestides, glycolipids and sugars hereafter TAG in a sample of body fluids of mammals, more particularly those TAG which increase as undifferentiated cells, especially tumor or cancer cells proliferate, and diagnosis of cancer based on such determination. Background Art It has heretofore been used a method of determining the level of specific glycoproteins in a sample of body fluids of patients with cancer. This process makes use of the antigenicity mainly of the protein moiety of the glycoproteins. For example, a1 foetoprotein level and carcinoembryonic antigen hereafter CEA level are determined for the diagnosis of primary hepatoma and of cancers of digestive organs, particularly rectal cancer, etc. cf. Igaku no Ayumi,Vol. 106, No. 5, Fifth Saturday Special Issue, pp. 235 to 250 1978 . however, these methods are not satisfactory since their applicability is limited to certain types of cancers and tumors. On the other hand, no diagnostic method utilizing the linking specificity of the sugar residue of TAG is known heretofore. There is a long existing need for a simple, inexpensive quantitative methodology to determine TAG levels in body fluids which has a wide applicability. Disclosure of Invention Paying attention to the fact that in the body fluids of individuals or patients with cancer there is present TAG produced by undifferentiated cells mostly cancer cells and released into the body fluid and thatTAG is drastically different from glycolinkage containing substances produced by differentiated cells mostly normal cells and released into the body fluids in the chemical structure of the sugar chain, its length and the composition of sugar residues, extensive investigations have been made which have led to the discovery thatTAG has a galactose gl3 or 4 N acetylglucosamine and or N acetylgalactosamine terminal and binds specifically with lectins, and that the TAG level in a sample of body fluid can be determined by reacting the TAG with a lectin.The TAG level will indicate presence or absence of cancer cells, degree of proliferation thereof and rise and fall thereof and permit successful diagnosis of various cancers or tumors. This invention is based on the above discovery. Thus, this invention provides a method for determining the TAG level in a sample of body fluid which comprises reacting the TAG in a sample of the body fluid with a lectin to form a TAG lectin complex and measuring the amount of the TAG lectin complex or an unreacted lectin, and a kit for use in such method. Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 is a graph representing the amounts of TAG found in the body fluids of patients suffering various cancers and of healthy persons determined in accordance with Example 2 described hereinafter, and Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the amounts of TAG found in various body fluids determined according to Example 3 described hereinafter. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Various body fluids can be used in this invention. Examples of suitable body fluids include blood, tissue fluids, lymph, hydrothorax, ascites, amniotic fluid, gastric juice, urine, pancreatic juice, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, etc. Of these blood, especially in the form of serum or plasma is preferred. The amount of body fluid for samples is usually about 1 to about l0 mQ, preferably 2 to 5 mQ. In this invention the determination of TAG level in a sample of body fluid can be carried out either by isolating or separating TAG from the body fluid reacting it with a lectin to form a TAG lectin complex and measuring the amount of the TAG lectin complex or unreacted lectin after separation thereof, or by adding a labeled lectin to the body fluid sample directly to form TAG labeled lectin complex, separating the resultingTAG labeled lectin complex or unreacted labeled lectin and measuring the amount thereof. To separate the TAG fraction from a body fluid sample, conventional methods for the extraction or separation of glycolinkage containing substances such as salting out, precipitation, extraction with solvents, centrifugation, dialysis, molecular sieve, enzyme inactivation, etc., or a combination of one or more of them can be used. For example, TAG fraction can be obtained by adding a precipitation or denaturation effective amount of sulfosalicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid or zinc sulfate to blood serum or plasma, or heating the blood serum or plasma to precipitate albumin, immunoglobulin and the like, removing the precipitated proteins by filtration and dialysing the filtrate. In cases where a labeled lectin is used, the body fluids collected other than blood can be used as is as a test sample hereafter sample . It is, however, preferred to add a protein having a low sugar content such as bovine serum albumin BSA , etc., as a protective protein in order to prevent the sample from denaturing and at the same time promote the reaction with lectin.More preferably, an appropriate amount of the protective protein is added to samples after removing albumins, immunoglobulins, etc., from the samples since this permits determination under more controlled conditions.When using blood samples, blood serum obtained by the conventional blood serum collecting method, or blood plasma obtained by the conventional blood plasma collecting method using an anticoagulant such as heparin, EDTA, citric acid, etc., can be used as a sample, with blood plasma collected using heparin as an anticoagulant being preferred. Samples can be diluted with water or suitable aqueous buffer solutions, if necessary or desired, e.g., in cases where the TAG level is relatively high as in ascites, etc. In this invention those lectins which can specifically combine with galactosew 3 or 61 4 N acetylglucosamine and or N acetylgalactosamine as described in J.B.C., 250, 8518 8523 1975 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 62, 144 1975 Z. Immunitaetsforch., 138, 423 433 19693, Br. J. Exp. Pathol., 27, 228 236 1946 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, No. 5, 2215 2219 1978 Biochemistry, 13, 196 204 1974 , CarbohydrateResearch, 51, 107 118 1976 , etc., for example, peanut lectin, castor bean Ricinus communis lectin, etc., can be used. Substances which can be used for labeling lectins and thereby make them detectable by radiometric, fluorimetric, colorimetric and like means are enzymes, fluorescent substances and radioactive substances. Examples of suitable enzymes include glucoamylase, glucose oxidase, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, 6 galactosidase, hemeoctapeptide, etc., and active fragments thereof. Examples of suitable fluorescent substances include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamin, dansyl chloride i.e., 5 dimethylamino l naphthalenesulfonyl chloride , etc. Examples of suitable radioactive substances include radioactive iodine, tritium, etc. To label lectins with the above described labeling substances, any conventional methods employed for labeling known proteins such as antigens and antibodies with enzymes, fluorescent substances and radioactive substances can be used.For example, lectins can be labeled with radioactive isotopes according to the method described in Kazuo Shizunome and YuichiKumahara Radioimmunoassay , pp. 45 56 1978 published by Asakura Publishing Co., Tokyo. In the method of this invention labeled or unlabeled lectins are preferably used in admixture with suitable solvents. Any solvents which do not denature labeled or unlabeled lectins, for example, physiological salt solution, water, 0.1 M tris HC buffer solution CpH about 7.5 , 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution pH about 7.4 , etc., can be used. The amount of lectin contained in the solvent or diluent can be chosen depending on agglutination value which is defined in terms of a final or maximum dilution of serially 2 fold diluted samples , the type of label, or the substances to be determined, etc., and usually is about 0.01 to about 100 llg mQ, preferably 0.03 to 40 vg m . The above labeled or unlabeled lectin solutions can be diluted further. In order to practice the method of this invention, a predetermined amount of TAG fraction or body fluid per se is mixed with a given amount of lectin or labeled lectin, respectively and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand for reaction at about 450C or less preferably about 4 to 400C, most preferably about 20 to 400C. The TAG unlabeled or labeled lectin complex or the unreacted unlabeled or labeled lectin, can be separated from the reaction mixture by any conventional separating technique, for example2 chromatography, electrophoresis, salting out, fractionation, dialysis, gel filtration, adsorption or a combination of them or a separation method using agar gel, agarose gel or polyacrylamide gel. In greater detail, to separate the unreacted labeled or unlabeled lectin from the reaction mixture, a suitable amount of a precipitant for the TAG lectin complex can be added to the above reaction mixture and the resulting complex can be removed, e.g., by centrifugation thereby obtaining the unreacted labeled or unlabeled lectin fraction as a supernatant. Representative precipitants are polyethylene glycol, ammonium sulfate to saturation3, Rivanol acrinol , etc. The conditions for centrifugation can be chosen appropriately depending on the precipitants used. For example, when polyethylene glycol is used as a precipitant it is preferred to perform centrifugation at about 1,000 G for about 30 to 60 minutes. In cases where TAG labeled or unlabeled lectin complex is isolated from the unreacted lectin, the complex can be separated with ease from the unreacted lectin utilizing the difference in diffusion speed between the complex and unreacted lectin on agar gel, agarose gel or polyacrylamide gel. More particularly, when the reaction mixture is layed on the gel in a vessel unreacted lectin diffuses into the gel which theTAG lectin complex remains on the gel, i.e., outside the gel without being diffused. Thus, they can be separated from each other with ease in the conventional manner.There is no limitation in the preparation of the gels and conventionally used methods can be employed for this purpose. For example, a certain amount of agar, agarose or polyacrylamide is added to a diluent which will not cause denaturation of proteins such as distilled water, citrate or Tris HCQ buffer solution pH about 7.5 , etc., followed by heating at 60 to 800C with gently stirring to dissolve and the solution is poured into a suitable vessel such as a test tube and allowed to cool to congeal like jelly. The concentration of the gel is chosen depending on the dimension e.g., molecular weight, stereostructure, etc. of the labeling substance and TAG labeled lectin complex. Usually gels of about 0.4 to 2.0 by weight, preferably 0.7 to 1.0 by weight are used in this invention. The resulting gel can contain a preservative if necessary or desired.The surface of the gel thus prepared may be flat or concave, with the latter form being preferred since complexes to be formed will not adhere on the wall of the vessel. The amount of the TAG labeled or unlabeled lectin complex or unreacted labeled or unlabeled lectin is measured by the conventional method and the TAG level in the body fluid can be calculated from the value obtained. For measurement of the amount of the residual unlabeled lectin various methods can be used. It is preferred, however, to add to samples a substance capable of reacting with the lectin specifically to agglutinate or precipitate it and observe the change visually or by measuring using an optical analysis, e.g., optical density. Examples of suitable lectin agglutinating substances include glycoproteins having a galactose 3 or ssl 4 N acetylglucosamine terminal, for example, rabbit erythrocyte, neuraminidase treated sheep erythrocyte, etc., and Sephadex, glass beads, etc., coated with the above described glycoproteins. Practically, this method can be carried out as follows. The above described reaction mixture is diluted serially with two fold dilution with a diluent, e.g., 0.15 M phosphate buffer solution, physiological salt solution2 etc., and aliquots of the dilution are placed on V or U form plates or side glasses or in small test tubes or the like and each mixed with a substance capable of agglutinating the lectin specifically with stirring and the plates or the like bearing the mixture are allowed to stand at 450C or less, preferably 4 to 40 C for 30 minutes or more, preferably 60 to 90 minutes to observe final or maximum dilution at which agglutination will still occur. This maximum dilution is defined as agglutination value.The lectins which can be used in this invention exhibit substantially the same agglutination value. In cases where labeled lectins are used, the determination of TAG level can be performed by a method suited for measuring labeled substances for lectins. For example, after separating TAG lectin complex and unreacted labeled lectin from each other the amount ofTAG labeled lectin complex or unreacted labeled lectin can be determined by selecting an appropriate substrate for an enzyme which substrate can be analyzed by colorimetric or fluorimetric analysis and determining the activity of the enzyme when the lectin is labeled therewith by determining the intensity of fluorescence when the lectin is labeled with a fluorescent substance or by determining the radioactivity when the lectin is labeled with a radioactive substance. For example2 when an enzyme e.g., peroxidase is used for labeling lectin, a predetermined amount of the reaction mixture is dropped on the surface of the gel in a test tube and allowed to stand at about room temperature, preferably 4 to 25 C for 1 to 48 hours.Then, a given amount of a suitable substrate for the enzyme e.g., hydrogen peroxide is added to the reaction mixture thus treated to effect enzymatic reaction followed by stopping it in an appropriate period of time and the optical density of the resulting mixture is measured if necessary using a dye or color former e.g., o phenylenediamine . Alternatively, when a fluorescent substance is used for labeling lectin, a predetermined amount of diluent such as a buffer solution is added to the reaction mixture on the gel after incubation and the intensity of fluorescence of the resulting mixture is measured. A particularly convenient procedure for carrying out the method described herein is by means of a kit for the determination of TAG in a body fluid, such as plasma or serum. Such a kit can include a reagent containing a plant lectin as a specific agglutinating agent for TAG. The lectin reagent can also contain a stabilizer and or preservative for lectin, such as proteins having a low sugar content, e.g., such as bovine serum albumin. In a preferred embodiment, this plant lectin reagent can be lyophilized and a reconstituting reagent containing an aqueous based or a water miscible solvent pH about 6 to 7.8, preferably 7 to 7.2 can also be included in the kit. The reagents may optionally also contain buffers for maintaining the reconstituted reagent system at a controlled pH and preservatives and or stabilizers intended to prevent deterioration of the material prior to use.Although buffers are not considered a critical component of the kit reagents, preferably a pH of about 6 to 7.8, more preferably pH 7 to 7.2 would be used in carrying out the present method.The reconstituting reagent preferably can contain water as a solvent. For example, physiological salt solution, phosphate buffer solution, etc., can be used as a reconstituting agent. Further, a water miscible solvent which will not affect the reaction adversely may be added. As stated hereinabove the TAG level in a sample of body fluid can be determined advantageously in accordance with this invention. Further, this invention which permits recognition of tumor associated glycolinkage enjoys a wide applicability to various cancers or tumors as compared with conventional methods or systems utilizing antigenicity and recognizing mainly the protein moiety of glycoproteins such as CEA, alpha 1 foetoprotein, etc. , and is applicable to the diagnosis of any cancers or tumors such as gastric cancer, mammary cancer, colon cancer2 rectal cancer, ovarian cancer, oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer, larynx cancer, prostate cancer2 liposarcoma, malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, gastric primary sarcoma, hepatoma, etc., in their early to late stages with ease and therefore this invention is very useful for the detection of cancers in their initial stages. This invention will be explained in greater detail with reference to Examples which should be construed as being non limitative. Unless otherwise indicated all parts or percentages used hereinafter are by weight.Example 1 i3 Preparation of Test Sample Blood was collected from each of 7 patients with gastric cancer, 4 patients with lung cancer, 3 patients with mammary cancer, and one patient each with colon cancer, rectal cancer, ovarian cancer, oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer, larynx cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, liposarcoma, malignant lymphoma and gastric primary sarcoma and plasma samples were prepared in the conventional manner.To the plasma samples was added a 6 aqueous sulfosalicylic acid solution portionwise with stirring till the proportion of the additive to the plasma became 1 1 by volume. After stirring sufficiently the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 to 3,500 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant was dialyzed with water and 0.15 M phosphate buffer solution for 24 hours to prepare test sample. ii Determination To each of test samples obtained in Ci above was added an equivolume of 0.15 M phosphate buffer solution having dissolved therein 0.8 ,ug mQ of peanut lectin a product of E.Y. LABORATORIES INC. and the mixture was reacted with stirring at 20 to 370C for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with a 0.15 M phosphate buffer solution to obtain a series of two fold dilutions each of which was placed on a V form plate in an amount of 50 pQ and mixed with 50 u of rabbit erythrocyte 1 x 108 to 2 x 108 cells mQ with stirring.After allowing the dilution at 370C for 1 hour occurrence of agglutination of erythrocyte in each dilution was abserved. Maximal dilution value at which the agglutination still occurred was defined as agglutination value and judgement was made using this value. The results obtained are shown in Table 1 below.

All four patients with lung cancer showed an agglutination value of 1. With respect to other cancer almost all the patients had agglutination values of 8 or less with exceptions being an agglutination value of 32 observed with one patient with uterine cancer and another with gastric primary sarcoma. As stated above, agglutination value observed in patients with malignant tumor or cancer is always 32 or less while that of the healthy is 128 or more. Therefore, this method provides an efficient method of determining TAG level in a sample of body fluid outside the body and can be useful in diagnosing various malignant tumors or cancers.Example 2 i Activation of Peroxidase To 1 mQ of 0.3 M aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution having dissolved therein 5 mg of peroxidase derived from horse raddish was added 0.1 mQ of 0.1 M fluorodinitrobenzene ethanol solution and the mixture was stirred gently for 1 hour at room temperature.Then, 1 mQ of 0.06 M aqueous Nail, solution was added to the mixture which was stirred gently at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was further mixed with 1 mQ of 0.1 M aqueous ethylene glycol solution and stirred gently at room temperature for 1 hour followed by dialysing the reaction mixture with 0.01 M carbonic acid sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer solution CpU 9.5 at 4 C for a day to obtain activated peroxidase preparation. ii Labeling of Lectin with Peroxidase Five mg of lectin peanut lectin was dissolved in 3 mQ of the peroxidase preparation obtained in i above and the mixture was stirred gently at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours for reaction. After adding 5 mg of NaBli4 thereto the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at 4 C for 3 hours and the resulting solution was dialysed with 0.1 M Tris HCt buffer solution pH 7.4 for a day followed by subjecting to gel filtration usingSephadex G 150 gel column chromatography Eluant 0.1 M Tris HCt buffer solution pH 7.4 . Optical densities OD280 and OD403 of each fraction obtained were measured and the fractions of which the peaks of OD280 and OD403 overlapped each other were collected. iii Preparation of Agarose Gel Agarose a product of Iwai Kagaku Co., Ltd. was suspended in 0.01 M Tris HC buffer solution CpU 7.5 in an amount of 1 by volume and the suspension was heated at 70 to 80 C to dissolve. To this solution was added 0.01 v v of thimerosal and the resulting solution was poured into test tubes in an amount of 1 m tube followed by allowing to stand at room temperature to prepare 1 wiw agarose gel. iv Preparation of Test Sample Five mQ of blood was taken from each of twenty five patients with cancer, 2 patients with diseases other than cancer and 23 healthy persons using a syringe treated with heparin and was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant plasma was used as test sample. v Determination The test sample prepared in G above was placed in two test tubes in an amount of 200 llQ tube to which 50 each of the peroxidase labeled lectin preparation containing 3.5 g m of lectin in Tris HC buffer solution pH about 7.5 prepared in ReferenceStep of Example 2 was added. After lightly stirring it the mixture was allowed to stand at 20 to 300C for 1 hour for reaction.Then, 250 u of a solution of 8 Cw v polyethylene glycol Cmolecular weight 6,000 in 0.1 M Tris HCQ buffer solution was added to one of the test tubes and the mixture was stirred gently to formSample A, and 250 p of 0.1 M Tris HCQ buffer solution was added to another test tube and the mixture was stirred gently to form Sample B. Both Samples A and B were centrifuged for 40 to 60 minutes using a swing type rotor at 1,000 G after allowing the samples to stand at 20 to 30 C for 30 to 60 minutes for reaction. Fifty ij of the resulting supernatant was collected and added to 2 m of physiological salt solution prepared beforehand.After stirring it sufficiently the mixture was mixed with 500 ij of a substrate solution consisting of 0.1 M citrate buffer solution, orthophenylenediamine final concentration 6 by weight and 0.1 by weight of hydrogen peroxide and reacted at 20 to 300C for 30 minutes in the dark. The substrate solution was prepared beforehand and stored at 4 C, which is preferred.Thereafter, 1 mQ of 2N hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction and the color of the sample was measured spectrophotometrically in terms of optical density at 492 nm. The amount of TAG lectin complex being defined as difference c obtained by subtracting the optical density Ca of Sample A from the optical density Cb of Sample B was plotted in Figure 1 in which the symbol 0 represents healthy persons and numerals 1 to 27 designate the following patients 1 and 18 Gastric cancer C2 , 6 , 9 , 163 and 17 Lung cancer 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 and 13 Gastric cancer clearly stage 4 and 143 Progressive gastric cancer 10 Heart failure 11 Lymphadenitis 12 Colon cancer which metastated to liver 15 Uterine cancer metastated to lung 19 Hydatidenmole C20 Colon cancer C21 Uterine cancer 22 and 263 Ovarian cancer 23 Rectal cancer 24 Prostate cancer 25 Urethral cancer and 27 Hepatoma. From the results shown in Figure 1 it can be seen that samples showing c value higher than that observed in the samples from healthy persons containedTAG in amounts higher than the samples from healthy persons. From that it is strongly suggested that persons with high c value have tumor or cancer cells.Example 3 i Preparation of Test Sample Blood was collected from 14 patients with cancer and 8 healthy persons and test samples were prepared therefrom in the same manner as Example 2. ii Determination Fifty of dilution of the test sample which had been prepared in i3 above and diluted 104 fold with H solution which consisted of distilled water having dissolved therein 8 of sodium chloride, 0.4 of potassium chloride, 0.05 of sodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.06 of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.05 of magnesium sulfate, 0.05 of magnesium chloride, 0.1t of calcium chloride, and 1 of glucose was mixed with 50 ,uQ of the peroxidase labeled lectin preparation which had been prepared by Step iii of Example 2, diluted 100 fold with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution CpU 7.4 and incubated for 15 minutes in a water bath at 23 C. The resulting mixture was incubated for 15 minutes in a water bath at 23 C and then imposed gently on the surface of agarose gel prepared by the method which is described in Example 2. After incubating the test tube containing the gel in a water bath at 23 C for 1 hour 2 mQ of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution CpU about 7.4 was added to the agarose gel which was then stirred. The supernatant was transferred immediately to a clean test tube to which was then added 400 p of the substrate solution for peroxidase prepared according to the method ofExample 2. After stirring it sufficiently the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes for reaction. The enzymatic reaction was stopped with 1 mQ of 1 N hydrochloric acid, the reaction mixture was stirred sufficiently using a thermomixer or like means. The optical. density of the mixture thus treated was measured using a spectrophotometer at 492 nm. A mixture of 400 mQ of the substrate solution and 1 mt of 1 N hydrochloric acid was used as a blank. The optical density values obtained were treated in the same manner as in Example 2 and the amount of TAG lectin calculated was plotted in Figure 2 in which symbol 0 represents healthy persons and numerals 13 to 10 indicate the following patients 1 Gastric cancer 2 Hydatidenmole 3 Colon cancer C4 Uterine cancer S Ovarian cancer 6 Rectal cancer 7 Prostate cancer 8 Urethral cancer 93 Hepatoma and C10 Mammary cancer. As will be evident from the results shown inFigure 2 there is a remarkable difference in the level of TAG in body fluid between healthy persons and patients with various cancers. Industrial Applicability As described in the foregoing, TAG in the body fluid can be determined advantageously according to this invention, and knowledge of this TAG level enables one to diagnose any cancers either at their early stage or at their terminal stage. Therefore, this invention is very useful, in particular, for finding out cancers at their early stage. Further, by determination of glycolinkage, this invention can be applied to diagnosis of any cancers including, for example, gastric cancer, mammary cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, ovarian cancer, oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer, larynx cancer, prostate cancer2 liposarcoma, malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, gastric primary sarcoma, etc., more broadly than the conventional methods using antigen system in which mainly protein moiety of TAC C foetoprotein, CEA, etc. is determined.
