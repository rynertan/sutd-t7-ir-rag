# Production of liquid products from aliphatic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing liquid products e.g. gasoline blending components by conversion of a mixed paraffin olefin gaseous feedstock over two types of catalysts. In a first stage, the mixed feedstock is brought into contact with a partially deactivated catalyst which con verts olefins in the feed into liquid products. Gaseous prod ucts now rich in paraffins are separated and brought into contact in a second stage with another catalyst which is more active than that used in the first stage. The liquid products emerging from the second stage are thereafter separated and recovered. The catalyst is preferably a gallium oxide loaded MFI type zeolite.
