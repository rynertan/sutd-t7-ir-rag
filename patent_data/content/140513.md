To be published in IEEE Transactions onMagnetics . This reference discusses sputtered CoCr thin films on glass substrates and on NiP surfaced aluminium alloy substrates.The object of the present invention is to provide an improved magnetic recording structure.According to the present invention a magnetic recording structure comprising a substrate, a non magnetic underlayer on said substrate and a magnetic layer on said underlayer is characterised in that both said non magnetic underlayer and said magnetic layer contain an alloy of Co and at least one other element.According to one embodiment of the invention both said non magnetic underlayer and said magnetic layer have a microstructure primarily in hexagonal close packed form so that the easy axis of said magnetic layer extends primarily perpendicular to the plane of said magnetic layer for vertical recording. According to another embodiment of the invention said non magnetic underlayer has a microstructure primarily in body centred cubic form and said magnetic layer has a microstructure primarily in hexagonal close packed torm so that the easy axis of said magnetic layer extends primarily parallel to the plane of said magnetic layer for horizontal recording. In order that the invention may be more readily understood reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a cross section of part of a thin film disk or other magnetic recording element for vertical magnetic recording including a magnetic layer, a non magnetic underlayer and a substrate in accordance with the present invention, Figure 2 is a graph showing variations in the anisotropy tield as a function of tne thickness of the underlayer of the disk or element illustrated in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a graph showing variations in magnetic orientation ratio as a function of the temperature of the substrate surface during manufacture of the disk or element illustrated in Figure 1, Figure 4 is a graph illustrating variations in magnetic film grain size as a function of the thickness of the magnetic layer of the disk or element illustrated in Figure 1, Figure 5 is a graph showing variations in perpendicular coercivity as a function of the thickness of the magnetic layer of the disk or element illustrated in Figure 1, and Figure 6 shows a cross section of part of a thin film disk or other magnetic recording element for horizontal recording including a magnetic layer, a non magnetic underlayer and a substrate in accordance with the present invention. Vertical Recording Structure Figure 1 shows a magnetic recording structure in accordance with the present invention using Co Cr Ta to form a hexagonal magnetic medium with vertical anisotropy. The structure is essentially a single layer with a magnetic layer lla having a hexagonal close packed hcp microstructure grown epitaxially on an isostructural, lattice matched, non magnetic underlayer llb. This underlayer llb is deposited on a underbstrate 12 which may be rigid or flexible and is composed of Co1 x Crx y Tay where 0.6 x 0.35 and 0.15 y 0.In this composition range, the underlayer lIb is found to exhibit an 002 oriented hexagonal close packed hcp microstructure with a lattice constant changing from 2.03 to 2.10 as y is increased from 0 to 0.15. This lattice constant closely matches that of the magnetic hcp layer lla of Co1 x, Crx, y Tay, where 0.35 x 0. The limit of 0.35 is determined by the composition of Co approx 65 atomic below which the alloy is no longer ferromagnetic. The values of both x and x must be greater than y, and for a binary Co Cr film y is zero for both layers. For example, a Co, Cr 2 magnetic layer can be grown epitaxially on a Co 5 Cr 5 non magnetic underlayer. The required thickness of the non magnetic underlayer llb on a particular substrate 12 is given by the thickness necessary to establish oriented growth of an 002 interface on which nearly perfect epitaxy of the magnetic layer lla can take place. This will clearly depend on the substrate material and other sputtering conditions. For example, the work by Messrs. Iwasaki and Ouchi CoCrRecording Films with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy identified above indicates that some degree of vertical anisotropy orientation ratio 8 can be achieved in approx 1 Wm thick Co Cr films grown directly on polyimide substrates.However it has been found thatCo Cr or Co Cr Ta films grown on Al Mg substrates without any underlayer t5 0 exhibit anisotropy field values smaller than the demagnetizing field, 4 sM , wnere M is the saturated magnetization S as illustrated in Figure 2. Therefore, such films are not suitable for perpendicular recording. From Figure 2, it can be seen that an underlayer thickness of at least 7000 Angstroms was found to be sufficient for achieving the highest vertical orientation. It should be noted that the interface between the magnetic layer lla and the underlayer llb is merely a boundary indicating a change in composition, with no structural or spatial disturbance in atomic arrangements. Therefore, the layers lla,llb are, in the metallurgical sense, a single phase film with a modulated composition profile. Furthermore, the composition modulation or variation is achieved in practice during manufacture by simply changing, either gradually or abruptly, the voltage applied to one or more sputtering targets in a multi target vacuum system. The magnetic recording structure illustrated in Figure 1 has been utilized to achieve the highest orientation ever reported in both Co Cr and Co Cr Ta vertical recording films. The structure was manufactured using a magnetron sputtering system with a base pressure in the range of 10 7 Torr. The system had three Varian S guns which can be used for either do or rf magnetron sputtering.The magnetic recording structure of Figure 1 for vertical recording has been manufactured using different combinations of elemental and alloy targets including Co and Cr, such as targets having compositions ofCo .82 cur Co 85 Cr 15 and Cho 8 Cr 1 Tea 1 The substrates 12 were heated to a temperature in the range of l900C to 3400C and were sputter cleaned for 5 minutes prior to film deposition to form the layers lIb and lla. The film deposition by sputtering was carried out at an argon gas pressure in the range of 2 5 mTorr.Under these experimental conditions, it was possible to achieve the highest vertical orientation ratios of 35 for Co 77 cur Ta 10 and 23 forCo 77 Cr 23 magnetic layers. Figure 3 shows the measured orientation ratios as a function of substrate surface temperature, T, during deposition of Co 77 Cr Ta 10 films. T was measured using an infrared sensor which was used to monitor the temperature rise due to ion bombardment during sputtering. The lowest temperature of 2200C which corresponds to only ion bombardment induced heating, i.e. no intentional substrate heating, results in a high value of the orientation ratio. By taking advantage of this result of lowering the process temperature the deposition procedure can be simplified by the shortening of the turnaround time. The microstructure of the deposited films was inspected using scanning electron microscopy which indicated extremely uniform columnar grains with no change in grain diameter over the magnetic layer lla thickness range of 2000 Angstroms to 10,000 Angstroms, as shown in Figure 4. Smaller as well as larger grain sizes in the range of 350 Angstroms to 4000 Angstroms were achieved by changing the substrate temperature used for growth of the film. Similarly, the magnetic properties of the magnetic layer lla were controlled independent of the thickness of this layer. Figure 5 shows the perpendicular coercivity measured in Co 77 Cr Tea 10 magnetic layers as a function of thickness of the layers in the range of 1000Angstroms to 10,000 Angstroms. Under the deposition conditions used, these highly oriented films exhibited perpendicular coercivities in the range of 850 Oe. The perpendicular coercivity could be controlled over the range of 400 Oe to 1300 Oe by changing the alloy composition as well as the substrate temperature. Magnetic test results of thin film vertical recording disks or other magnetic recording elements made as described above indicate excellent reproducibility of roll off curves of nominally identical disks which substantiated static magnetic measurements. A 3 dB recording density of more than 30,000 flux changes inch has been achieved using a thin film head with a gap spacing of 0.6 Wm at a flying height of 2500 Angstrom 10 inch . Horizontal Recording Structure In order to form magnetic structures suitable for horizontal recording, it has been found that by properly controlling the Co content of the nonmagnetic Co alloy underlayer lib, this underlayer can be deposited primarily in bcc form on a substrate 12, which may be either rigid or flexible. After deposition of the primarily bcc underlayer llb to the desired thickness, the Co content may be changed so that the overlaying sputtered layer lla of a Co alloy will be magnetic in primarily hcp form. The orientation of the C or easy axis of the hcp Co alloy magnetic layer lla can be oriented in the plane of the magnetic structure, thus producing a horizontal recording structure. This dual layer structure is illustrated inFigure 6 and provides a suitable environment for orienting the C axis of the magnetic hcp layer in the plane of the structure .The composition of the magnetic layer lla is Co1 Z, and the composition of the non magnetic underlayer llb is Co X where Z and x X are one or more additive elements selected from a group includingCr, Ru, Pt, Pd, W, Ta, V, Mo, and Ti. For the general case in which the layers lla and lIb are Co alloys with Z or X, the following relationships should exist among the compositions of the alloys Magnetic Layer COl x ZxB where 0.01 x 0.35 Nonmagnetic Underlayer Co1 x Xx where 0.60 x .99 For the more specific case in which the layers lla and llb are Co Cr alloys with Z or X, it has been found that the following relationships should exist among the compositions of the alloys Magnetic Layer Co1 x1 Cr Z where 0.01 x 0.35 x y y where 0.01 y 0.15 Nonmagnetic Underlayer Co Cr X where 0.35 x 0.99 1 x x y y where 0 y 0.15 A structure manufactured so as to produce the above relationships provides a pseudo lattice between the 110 plane of the hcp microstructure of the magnetic layer lla and the 002 plane of the bcc microstructure of the underlayer lIb which places the C axis, 002 direction, of the hcp lattice in the plane of the magnetic layer lla. This is termed pseudo epltaxial because epitaxial refers to methods of growing single crystals, and the CoCr materials involved here are polycrystalline. It has been found that if the magnetic layer Ila is sputtered directly onto the substrate 12, the layer does not have a highly oriented structure.This is because the substrate surface presents a disordered interface to the deposited magnetic layer, so no lattice matching occurs. The use of an underlayer llb effectively isolates the substrate 12 from the magnetic layer lla, and has the important effect of allowing the choice and use of substrates to be made essentially independently of the particular magnetic layer used. In one example employing a CoCrRu magnetic layer Ila, the nonmagnetic CoCr underlayer llb had a bcc crystal structure and contained about 15 atomic Co. Under the deposition conditions employed, this underlayer was found to induce preferred growth of the 002 plane of bcc in the thickness range from 500 to 3500 Angstroms.X ray diffraction patterns of the overlaying CoCrRu magnetic layer 300 1500 Angstroms indicated predominance of the hexagonal 110 plane. This crystallographic orientation, which involves in plane alignment of the hexagonal C axis, is enhanced by a favourable lattice matching 3 with the 002 CrCo underlayer. The magnetic recording structure illustrated in Figure 6 has been manufactured using a magnetron sputtering system with a base pressure around 10 7 Torr. The system had three Varian S guns which can be used for either dc or rf sputtering. The system was operated using different combinations of alloy and elemental targets including Co Cr 2 Co 85Cr0.15 Co0 93Ru0,07 and Cr. Al Mg disk substrates were sputter cleaned for five minutes prior to film deposition to form the layers llb and lla. The film deposition by sputtering was carried out at a temperature in the range of 50 to 2000C under argon gas pressure of 2 3 mTorr. The horizontal C axis anisotropy in structures as illustrated inFigure 6 is believed to contribute to the high squareness of their in plane magnetic loops. Typical loop parameters were coercive squareness 0.95, squareness 0.85, and remanence 3200 to 4200Gauss. Desired coercivity values in the range of 350 to 700 Oe and 3 2 Mr values from 1 to 4 X10 3 emu cmê could easily be obtained by varying deposition conditions including the composition of the layers. The latter was in the range of Co 77 83, Cr 16 23, andRu 0 2 atomic .In general, it has been found that the coercivity of the magnetic layer lla increases with increases in either substrate temperature, underlayer thickness or Co concentration, and the coercivity increases with decreasing thickness of the magnetic layer lla. In addition to layers of CoCrRu, excellent magnetic disks for longitudinal recording have been produced by sputter depositing a magnetic layer lla of CoCr, primarily in hcp form, on a nonmagnetic layer llb of CoCr, primarily in bcc form. Further, magnetic layers lla of CoPt, primarily in hcp form, have been deposited on nonmagnetic layers llb of CoCr, primarily in bcc form, with excellent magnetic results. Still further, magnetic layers lla of CoPd, primarily in hcp form, have been deposited on nonmagnetic layers llb of CoCr, primarily in bcc form, to produce very satisfactory horizontal recording disks. For palladium, the magnetic layer lla can have the same formulation range as for platinum. For both Pd and Pt magnetic layers, the nonmagnetic underlayer lIb can have the same formulation range described above with reference to Figure 6. A series of CoCrRu layers were formed in structures as illustrated in Figure 6 with a range of coercivity from 390 to 695 Oe and a range of thickness from 350 to 1000 Angstroms. Longitudinal recording tests were performed using thin film heads made with a gap spacing of 0.6 zm at flying height of 10 Rinch. These high coercivity structures exhibited isolated pulse amplitudes of 430 gV, a half amplitude width, PW50, of 1.27 mm, and a 3dB point of 730 flux changes mm. Good overwrite characteristics, smooth envelopes, and low noise levels were observed on all structures tested. SUMMARY For both the vertical and horizontal recording structures Figures 1 and 6 , the additive elements are chosen for purposes of attaining specific magnetic properties in the magnetic layer lla, improving metallurgical stability of both layers lla and llb, improving their adherence and or adjusting the lattice constant of both layers to attain or enhance lattice matching between the nonmagnetic underlayer llb and the substrate 12, such that the crystallographic orientation of the magnetic layer lla is conducive to attainment of large magnetic anisotropy whose easy axis of magnetization is oriented either perpendicular to or parallel to the plane of the substrate 12. Multiple levels or stackings of the above underlayer and magnetic layer structures can also be used. Following are some of the advantages achieved by employing the magnetic recording structures described herein 1. The manufacturing process for the structure is a simple process involving the deposition of two compatible metal layers in one vacuum pump down with excellent uniformity and thickness control of the layers. 2. The manufacture of the structures has been achieved reproducibly in different sputtering systems using various target combinations. 3. The manufacturing process is reasonably tolerant to practical process variations of power density, sputtering pressure, and background pressure. 4. The structures are characterised by consistent recording performance featuring large signal amplitude, narrow pulse width, high bit density, low noise, and low defect counts.
