# TRIAZOLINETHIONE CONTAINING POLYMERS

## Abstract
An uncrosslinked poly triazolinethione is prepared by a process comprising the steps a providing a poly acylthiosemicarbazide , b cyclodehydrating the poly acylthiosemicarbazide by subjecting it to an elevated temperature of 60 to 150 C in the presence of an aqueous alkaline solution to form a polyanion of a poly triazolinethione , c treating the polyanion of the poly triazolinethione with aqueous acid solution to provide the poly triazo linethione , and d isolating the resulting poly triazolinethione.
