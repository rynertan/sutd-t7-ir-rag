# Fluidized bed injection assembly for coal gasification.

## Abstract
A coaxial feed system for fluidized bed coal gasification processes including an inner tube 28 for injecting pariculate combustibles into a transport gas, an inner annulus 34 about the inner tube for injecting an oxidizing gas, and an outer annulus 36 about the inner annulus 34 for transporting a fluidizing and cooling gas. The combustibles and oxidizing gas are discharged vertically upward directly into the combustion jet, and the fluidizing and cooling gas is discharged in a downward radial direction into the bed below the combustion jet. This feed system greatly reduces sensitivity to clogging of the feed channels.
