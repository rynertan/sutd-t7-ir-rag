# Separation process.

## Abstract
One or more components of a fluid fossil fuel are separated by subjecting the fluid fossil fuel to a centrifugal force in a rotor. A lighter component is withdrawn from adjacent the axis of the rotor and a heavier component is withdrawn from adjacent its periphery. Thus crude oil may be stabilised or dehydrated or natural gas may be dried by this method.
