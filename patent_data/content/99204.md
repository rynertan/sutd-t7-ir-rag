# Gun sight.

## Abstract
An optical gun sight provides a lead angle for a moving target. A first telescope 10 of fixed increasing magnification provides a first relatively large image of the target, and a second telescope 18 of selectable increasing magnification provides a second image smaller than the first image. The images are combined in a combining glass 12 or prism and presented to an eyepiece 16 . This structure permits the magnification of the second telescope to be selected in accordance with the known engagement speed of an aircraft and the images then to be spaced by a multiple of second image lengths as a function of aircraft course and distance to provide the desired lead angle.
