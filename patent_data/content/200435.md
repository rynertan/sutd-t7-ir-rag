# An electrically augmented vacuum filtration apparatus with a non ion selective membrane, construction of the membrane, and method of making the membrane.

## Abstract
An electrically augmented vacuum filter for dewatering a suspension of solids in a carrier liquid has an anodic electrode structure, 18 comprising an anode 21 and a liquid impervious wall 22 wherein the wall is a non ion selective membrane which is permeable to both cations and anions and is impervious to the suspension solids, carrier liquid, electrolyte and gaseous electrode reaction products. This non ion selective membrane comprises a substrate and a solid polymeric film, wherein the substrate is a cloth support and the solid polymeric film comprises a cation exchange resin, an anion exchange resin and a binder. The charge transfer numbers of the non ion selective membrane t is in the range of 0.20 to 0.80 and t in the range of 0.80 to 0.20, respectively. A method of making the membrane is described.
