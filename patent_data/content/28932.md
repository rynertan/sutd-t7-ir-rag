# Folded cascode amplifier arrangement with cascode load means.

## Abstract
A folded cascode amplifier arrangement includes first and second transistors P2, N7 of complementary conductiv ity type and a constant current generator 30 for supplying quiescent current thereto. Signal current flowing in the first transistor P2 is coupled to the second transistor N7 through current steering at the inter connection between their main conduction paths. The load means for the second transistor includes a cascode connected third transistor P7 for supplying load current thereto, which third transistor P7 substantially increases the resistance of the load giving the advantage of correspondingly increasing the voltage gain of the amplifier arrangement. A further advantage is that the amplifier voltage gain transfer function exhibits a frequency response dominated by a single pole. The load means may include a fourth transistor P4 in series with the third for yet further increasing the load impedance.
