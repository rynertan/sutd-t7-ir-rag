# Metal complexes, their preparation and production of hydrogen peroxide therewith.

## Abstract
Coordination complexes which may be used in a cyclic process for the production of hydrogen peroxide by autoxidation, having the formula The coordination complex being sufficiently stable for the metal ion to be oxidised and reduced without decomposition of the complex and the metal ion being in its lower oxidation state. The preparation of the complex comprises the condensation of a tris alkyl diamine metal ion complex with formaldehyde and a nucleophile.
