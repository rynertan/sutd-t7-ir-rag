# 2 Isocyanatosulfonylbenzoic acid esters and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
2 Isocyanatosulfonylbenzoic acid esters of the general formula CHEM wherein R is selected from various hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl groups R2 is H, Cl, Br, F, C1 C3 alkyl, NO2, OCH3, SCH3, CF3, SO2CH3, N CH3 2, CN, or 4 N C O and R3 is H, Cl, Br or CH3 with the proviso that when R is other than C3 C10 alkynyl, then R2 must be 4 NCO. are novel intermediates for the preparation of herbicidal ureas. The isocyanates may be prepared e.g. by reacting a corresponding 2 sulfamoylbenzoate ester of general formula CHEM wherein R2 min is NH2 or R2 as defined above, with a hydrocarbyl isocyanate and phosgene in the presence of a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine base and an inert solvent.
