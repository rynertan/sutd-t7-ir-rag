# Spatial phase modulating masks and production processes thereof, and processes for the formation of phase shifted diffraction gratings.

## Abstract
Spatial phase modulating transparent masks comprising two or more portions having two different optical paths and their production processes are disclosed. The transparent masks are particularly useful as an exposure mask in the production of phase shifted, distributed feedback DFB semiconductor lasers for a single mode operation. A process for the formation of phase shifted diffraction gratings or corrugations 23 which comprises exposing a substrate 12 , through the above transparent mask 11 , to exposure radiation 15, 16 is also disclosed. According to the present invention, the phase shifted diffraction gratings can be easily and directly produced with a high accuracy and reliability.
