# UNIVERSAL KEYBOARD MOUNT AND ADJUSTABLE KEYBOARD SUPPORT

## Abstract
A universal keyboard mount is disclosed utilizing a keyboard mounting plate and a carrier for that plate. The carrier has a cushioning section which cushions one surface of the keyboard. The keyboard mounting plate has a cushion ing section which cushions an opposed surface of the keyboard. The keyboard mounting plate and carrier are adjustably positioned so that the cushioning sections thereof may move toward and away from each other. Bumpers adjustably mounted are utilized to prevent the keyboard from striking adjacent surfaces of the work surface as the keyboard mount is moved. An adjustable keyboard support is also disclosed consti tuted by a rear housing that pivotally supports one end of a paralled link mechanism. A front housing is carried by the other end of the parallel link mechanism, and pivotally sup ports a keyboard mounting place. The parallel link mechan ism permits upward and downward movement of the keyboard mounting plate without change of the tilt of that plate. A gas cylinder mechanism coupled to the front hous ing changes the vertical position of the same, and a slide plate adjustment mechanism provides forward and back ward movement of the keyboard mounting plate.
