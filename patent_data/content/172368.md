## Description
The invention relates to a method for displaying an image stored in a raw image memory on a display device. From US A 4 107 780 a raster display is known that can be built up from a number of zones. Each of this zone is associated with a zone management processor for controlling the intensity and hue of this zone from information supplied defining the boundary of the zone, its intensity and hue. The information displayed here is supplied from a buffer store and different areas of the screen can be controlled differently. This known device does not give a hint towards the solution of the present invention to display an entire image in one part of the screen and an enlarged part of this entire image in a second part of the screen. From EP A 0 009 378 a copying system is known which enables the selection of any portion of an original, the magnification or reduction of the selected portion, and the reproduction of the thus modified portion at any location on the copy of the complete original image. For that purpose a first memory for storing the entire image is foreseen, an image process portion for selecting a portion of the original image and for magnifying or reducing it is foreseen and means are foreseen for determining the position of this selected portion on the final copy. The result of this overlaying is stored in a secondary memory and printing means are provided to print from that second memory means the stored resulting image. Also this known prior art does not contain the solution given by the present invention nor does it give a hint to display an enlarged portion of an entire image beside the displayed entire image neither the indication in the displayed entire image from where said displayed enlarged portion is taken. Japanese published unexamined patent application 53 90822 discloses the display of an enlarged partial image along with an enlargement indicator. The enlargement indicator is a small square indicator which is divided into small blocks or dices. One of the small blocks is selected by an operator, and an enlarged partial image corresponding to the selected small block is displayed. The enlargement indicator, however, does not show the entire image. It shows only the entire contour, so that the operator could not observe the entire image thus, the operator could not see an entire image on the display screen resulting in that the operator could not perform an image process by moving the cursor on the entire image. The problems solved in advantageous manner by the invention are the following Also, a display of a partial image of the full page image is required. In the former case, the operator could observe the entire image, but could not see the partial image in detail. In the latter case, the operator could not see the entire image. As described hereinbefore, the display of the both enlargement indicator and the detailed partial image on the display screen was proposed. But, it has the disadvantage that the operator could not see the entire image as in the latter case. Therefore, it has been required to observe both the entire image and the partial image on the display screen, and to specify or select a partial area of any size within the entire image to process the image of the selected partial area. But, the precise selection of the partial area in the entire image was difficult since the entire image was a rough image with low fidelity. The invention relates to a method for displaying an image stored in a raw image memory on a display device and, in solving in an advantageous manner the above stated problems, the steps laid down in claim 1 are applied. Thus in advantageous manner, the invention provides a method for displaying an entire image on a portion of the display screen and a partial image of the entire image on the remaining portion of the display screen with a contour of the partial image being overlappingly displayed on the entire image. Further advantageous embodiments are laid down in the subclaims. Following the invention is described in more detail with reference to the attached drawing showing an embodiment of the invention. In the drawing Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the circuit for performing the process of the present invention. A data source 1 is provided, which could be a host computer, a data transmission line, or an image scanning device for supplying images to a raw image memory 2. The image stored in the raw image memory 2 is supplied to an all point addressable buffer APA buffer 3 through an entire image display control device 4 and a sighting scope image display control device 5. The APA buffer 3 is directly connected to a display screen of a display device 6, wherein the storage bit positions are related to display dot positions of the display device 6, respectively. A partial image display control device 7 is connected to the sighting scope image display control device 5 and a cursor display control device 8. A coordinate data input device 9 is connected to the partial image display control device 7. An image editing device 10 is connected to the raw image memory 2 and the partial image display control device 7. Fig. 2 shows an original image 24 which is stored in the raw image memory 2, and an entire image 22 and a sighting scope image or partial image 23 which are displayed on a display screen 21. In the exemplary embodiment, the original image 24 has 1632 x 2016 dots, the display screen 21 has 640 x 200 dots. It is noted that each dot of the display surface 21 has an aspect ratio of 2 1 vertical size horizontal size . The entire image 22 has 272 x 168 dots and the sighting scope image 23 has 336 x 168 dots, which is displayed as square area due to the above aspect ratio. The entire image display control device 4 reduces the 1632 x 2016 dot original image 24 into the 272 x 168 dot entire image 22, with the reduction ratio of 1 6 in the horizontal direction and 1 12 in the vertical direction. The reduced entire image 22 is supplied to the APA buffer 3 and displayed on the left half of the display device 6. The partial image display control device 7 operates to display the partial image or sighting scope image 23 on the right half of the display screen 21. Now describing the operation of the present invention with referring to the operational flow chart of the Fig. 3, the operation starts at a block 31. In a block 32, the entire original image 24 stored in the raw image memory 2 is reduced and supplied to the APA buffer 3, and displayed on the left side of the display screen 21, as stated hereinabove. In a block 33, the positional data of a cursor 25 is supplied from the coordinate data input device 9 to the partial image display control device 7. Referring to the Fig. 4, the positional data X In a block 34, the partial image display control device 7 calculates the position of the partial display area in the raw image memory 2, which is displayed on the right half of the display screen 21. To this end, the partial image display control device 7 converts the position data X And, the partial image display control device 7 calculates the start or upper left position of the cursor in the raw image memory 2 by the following formulas In this embodiment, the size of the partially displayed area is fixed. Then, the partial image display control device 7 specifies the fixed partial area starting with the address T In a block 35, the cursor pattern is supplied to the APA buffer 3 under the control of the partial image display control device 7 and the cursor display control device 8, so that the cursor 25 is overlappingly displayed on the reduced entire image 22. In a block 36, the image of partial area starting with the address T Describing the movement of the cursor and the sighting scope image or partial image specified by the cursor, a block 37 indicates that the displacements dx and dy are supplied by the coordinate data input device 9. A block 38 determines whether the displacements have been supplied, or not. If NO, a block 39 determines whether a signal end of sighting scope image has been supplied, or not. If the output of the block 39 is NO, the operation returns to the block 37. If YES, the operation terminates at the end block 40. If the output of the block 38 is YES, the operation goes to a block 41 in which the cursor being displayed at X As described above, the cursor cross 26 is displayed on both the entire image 22 and the sighting scope image 23, and the image within the small cursor 25 in the left side entire image 22 is simultaneously displayed on the right side sighting scope image 23 as the enlarged image. Fig. 5 shows one example of the image specified by the cursor 25. It is apparent in the Fig. 5 that the image enclosed by the cursor 25 in the left side entire image 22 is enlargely displayed on the right side sighting scope image 23. The display of the entire image on the display screen is highly desirable in the image process. Due to the limited number of pels on the display screen, however, the entire image becomes rough image, and the operator could not precisely select or specify a point on the rough image. In the subject invention, the operator could roughly scan the entire image by moving the cursor on the entire image, simultaneously, he could see or observe its detailed partial image on the right side of the screen. The detailed image or the sighting scope image has the cursor cross. By moving the cursor on the rough entire image with seeing the sighting scope image, the operator could specify any point on the entire image. The image Move operation, as one example of the image process operation is shown in the Figs. 6 and 7. In this Move operation, an image of a source area is moved to a destination area, as shown in the Fig. 7. The operation starts at a block 61 in the Fig. 6. In blocks 62 and 63, the start point A and the end point B which define the source area are selected by positioning the cursor cross 26 at the points A and B. In a block 64, the start point C of the destination area is specified by the cursor cross 26. In a block 65, the image of the source area is moved to the destination area in the raw image memory 2, as shown in the Fig. 7.
