## Description
Lateral DEMOS transistor devices suitable for source follower applications.Background of the invention The invention is in the field of metal oxide semiconductor MOS field effect devices, and relates specifically to lateral DMDS field effect transistors suitable for use in source foilceer applications. Such transistors are often referred to as double diffused MCS transistors, although one or sore zones may be made entirely or partly by ion implantation, and their gate electrodes may consist of conductive layers other than metals, for instance of polycristalline silicon.Likewise, the insulating material between gate electrode and semiconductor surface may be another insulator than an oxide, for instance silicon nitride. A typical prior art high voltage DMKS transistor is shown on page 1325 of the TWEE Transactions on Electron Devices , Vol. ED 25, No. 11, November 1978, in a paper entitled Tradeoff Betw een ThresholdVoltage and Breakdown in High Voltage Double Diffused MOS Transistors , by Pocha et al.This device includes a semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type p type , a surface adjoining layer shaped region formed by an epitaxial surface layer of a second conductivity type n type on the substrate, a surface adjoining channel region of the first conductivity type in the epitaxial surface layer, a surfaceadjoining source region of the second conductivity type in the channel region, and a surface adjoining drain contact region of the second conductivity type in the epitaxial surface layer and spaced apart from the channel region. An insulating layer is provided on the surface layer and covers at least that portion of the channel region located between the source and drain.A gate electrode is provided on the insulating layer, over a portion of the channel region between the source and drain and is electrically isolated from the surface layer, while source and drain electrodes are connected respectively to the source and drain regions of the transistor. Such prior art high voltage DMDS transistors have a relatively thick surface layer typically an epitaxial layer , of the order of about 25 30 microns for a breakdown voltage of about 250V, as indicated in the Pocha et al paper. Rrrtherrmre, the punchthrough and avalanche breakdown characteristics of these devices relative to their epitaxial layer thickness make thein unsuitable for efficient use in applications requiring high voltages. It has been found that the breakdown characteristics of hi h voltaae semiconductor devices can be irproved using the REducedSURface Field or RESURF technique, as described in High Voltage Thin Layer Devices RESURF Devices , International Electronic DevicesMeeting Technical Diaest , December 1979, pages 238 240, by pels et al, and U.S. Patent No. 4,292,642 to Appels et al. Essentially, the intproved breakdown characteristics of these RESUPE devices are achieved by employing thinner but more highly doped epitaxial layers to reduce surface fields. The RESURF technique was applied to lateral DMOS transistors, as reported irl lateral DDDS Power Transistor Design , IEEE Electron Device Letters , Vol. EDL 1, pages 51 53, ADril 1078, by Colak et al and U.S.Patent No. 4,300,150. and the result was a substantial improve merit in device characteristics It should be understood that in high voltage DMOS devices, there is always a trade off between breakdown voltage, osn resisuance and device size, with the goal being to increase the breakdown voltage level while maintaining a relatively low on resistance in a relatively compact device.Using the prior art . RESURF technique, and for reference assuming a constant breakdown voltage of about 400 volts, a very substantial improvement e.g. decrease in or. resistance may be obtained in a device of the same size as a conventional thick epitaxial layer DMOS device. Hoever, such prior art RESVRF devices, with their thin epitaxial layers, are not suitable for use in source follower applications or other circuit arrangements where both the source and drain are at a high potential with respect to the substrate. For such applications, these devices would require a substantially thicker epitaxial surface layer, thus negating a principal advantage of the RESURF technique and increasing device size and cost, or they would require a lower epitaxial doping level, which would increase on resistance, again negation a principal advantage of the RESURF technique.Summary of the invention It is therefore an cutect of the present invention to provide a lateral DMOS transistor whicn is suitable for use in source follower applications or other circuit arrangements where both the source and drain are at a high potential with respect to the substrate It is a further object of the invention to provide a lateral DoDS transistor suitable for source follower applications while maintaining the advantage of devices constructed using the RESURF technique. In accordance with the invention, these objectives are achieved by a lateral DMOS transistor of the type described above, in which the single prior art surface layer on the semiconductor substrate is replaced by a 3 layer configuration including a first semiconductor layer of the second conductivity type on the substrate, a second semiconductor layer of the first conductivity type on the first layer, and a third semiconductor surface layer of the second conductivity type on the second layer. This 3 layer confiçur tion vermlts qteraticn in the source iollower mcde by preventing device breakdown when both the source and drain are operated at relatively high voltages with respect to the substrate. In a further embodiment of the invention, a plurality of spaced apart semiconductor zones of the second conductivity type are located within that portion of the second semiconductor layer extending from adjacent the channel region to beneath the drain contact region.These semiconductor zones may either be strip shaped zones which extend continuously from adjacent the channel region to beneath the drain contact region or else each zone may include first and second subzones, with the first subzone located adjacent to the channel region and the second subzone spaced apart from the first subzone and located beneath the drain contact region of the device. These semiconductor zones serve to prevent the first semiconductor layer from floating by connecting it to the third semiconductor surface layer of the device, and. also provide an additional RESURF effect in the lateral direction, thus improving both breakdown voltage and device conductivity. In another embodiment of the invention, device conductivity can be further improved by providing a second drain region and a further gate electrode, so that the second semiconductor layer can also contribute to device conductivity when the trans stow is in the on state.Brief descrittion of the drawinq Fig. 1 is a vertical cross sectional view of a lateral D S transistor in accordance with a first. ernbodi e nt of the invention Fig. 2A is a plan view along the section line 11 Il of the transistor of Fig. 1 Fig. 2B is a plan view of a lateral DEMOS transistor in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 2C is a plan view of a lateral DMDS transistor in accordance with a third embodiment of the invention and Fig. 3 is a vertical cross sectional view of a lateral DMCS transistor in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the invention.Detailed descrintion As noted above, conventional lateral DEMOS transistors are not suitable for efficient use in source follower circuits, because of the relatively thick epitaxial layers required to avoid punchthrough breakdown in the source follcwer mode.This results in an unduly large and expans ive to manuf acture device. Furtherncre, prior art RESURF tech piques, which permit the use of thinner epitaxial layers, result in devices which are unsuited for source follower applications because of similar high voltage breakdown problems. More specifically, in typical source follower applications, the device substrate is normally grounded, while the drain, source and channel regions of the device experience high voltage levels in the on state when these devices are operated with high power supply voltages.Under such conditions, conventionalRESURF devices are subject to punchthrough breakdown from channel to substrate which precludes operation in the source followar mode. These prior art problems are overcome in the present invention by a device such as that shown in Fig. 1, employing a triple layer structure above the substrate. It should be noted that Fig. 1, as well as the remaining Figures of the drawing, are not drawn to scale, and in particular the vertical dimensions are exaggerated for improved clarity.Additionally, like parts are designated with like reference numerals in the various figures, and semiconductor regions of the same conductivity type are shown hatched in the same direction. In Fig. 1, a lateral DMQS transistor 10 has a semiconductor substrate 12 of a first conductivity type, here p type, on which the device is constructed. A first semiconductor layer 14 of a second conductivity type opposite to that of the first, here n type, is located on a first major surface 12a of the substrate, while a second semiconductor layer 16 of the first conductivity type is located on the first semiconductor layer. The basic layered construction of the device is completed by a third semiconductor surface layer 18 of the second conductivity type which is located on the second layer. The lateral DMOS transistor of the invention is constructed within this layered structure by providing a first surface adjoining channel region 20 of p type material in the third layer, with a surfaceadjoining source region 22 of n type material in a portion of p type region 20. A first surface adjoining drain contact region 24 of n type material is provided in the third layer 18 and is spaced apart from the first channel region, and a portion of the third semiconductor surface layer 18 between the drain contact region 24 and the first channel region 20 forms an extended drain region 24a. Similarly, that portion of the second layer extending from the channel region 20 to beneath the first drain contact region 24 forms an extended channel region. An insulating layer 26 is provided on the surface of the transistor, over the third surface layer, and covers at least the portion of the first channel region 20 which is located between the source and the first drain regions. A first gate electrode 30 is provided on the insulating layer 26, over the previously mentioned portion of the first channel region, and is electrically isolated from the third layer by the insulating layer 26. An electrical connection to the first drain contact region 24 is provided by a first drain electrode 32, while a source electrode 28 is provided to contact the source region 22, and this source electrode also serves to connect the first channel region 20 to the source region 22.The basic construction of the device is caTple ted by a substrate electrode 34 on lower major surface 12b of the Subr strate 12. The principal difference between the present invention and prior art lateral DMCS transistors, such as Fig. 1 of U.S. PatentNo. 4,300,150 lies in the presence of the second semiconductor layer 16, which in Fig. 1 forms a p type extension of the channel region 20 between the n type first and third semiconductor layers, and which extends from the channel region 20 to beneath the drain region 24 24a. This configuration is in contrast to the prior art device shown in Fig. 1 ofU.S. Patent No. 4,300,150 in which the area between the channel and drain is composed of a single n type layer 12. The three layer configuration of the present invention affords several important design advantages, which permit the use of devices incorporating the present invention in source follower circuits. In particular, by providing an extended channel in the form of second semiconductor layer 16, it is possible to increase the doping levels of the n type first and third semiconductor layers to substantially avoid the channel to substrate punchthrough breakdown problems previously described. Ordinarily, such an increased doping level would be undesirable because it would reduce the drain to channel avalanche breakdown voltage of the device, t here, by adding the p type second semiconductor layer, this undesirable decrease in avalanche breakdown voltage is sub stantially avoided.By redistributing the electrical field over a greater area of the device, the p type second semiconductor layer utilizes the basic RESURF principle to reduce the localized magnitude of the electrical field adjacent the channel, and thus prevents avalanche breakdown in this region when higher doping levels are used in the third, and particularly the first, semiconductor layers in order to prevent punchthrough during operation in the source follower mode. Thus, the present invention results in a device which is particularly suitable for high voltage operation in the source follower mode due to its improved punchthrough and avalanche breakdown characteristics. Furthermore, in accordance with basic RESURF principles, the three semiconductor layers are not only more highly doped than in conventional devices, but are also substantially thinner, thus resulting in a smaller, less expensive and easier to manufacture device. Thus, while the total thickness of all three semiconductor layers i.e. the total thickness between insulating layer 26 and the upper surface 12a of the substrate may typically be about 6 microns in the present invention for a device capable of operating at 400 volts, the prior art AX S structure of Mocha et al, described above, requires an epitaxial layer thickness of greater than 23 microns in order to achieve a punchthrough breakdown voltage of only 200 volts. In addition, the relatively high doping levels of the semiconductor layers in the present invention provide improved normalized on resistance despite the use of relatively thin semiconductor layers. Thus, the present invention serves to improve both breakdown voltage and normalized on resistance, thereby permitting effective and efficient operation in the sourcefollower mode. While the configuration of the present invention can be advantageously used in various device constructions, the following table of approximate values will illustrate the configuration of a typical device having a breakdown voltage of about 400 volts TYPICAL TYPICALREGION Ref.

This plan view shows a horizontal section of the p type second semiconductor layer 16, as well as a portion of the more highly doped channel region 20 which extends into the second semiconductor layer beneath the source. Due to the substantially continuous nature of this intErmediate p type layer between the upper third and lower first semiconductor layers, the lower n type semiconductor layer does not conduct a portion of the total device current in the on state because layer 14 is isolated from the currentcarrying path due to the intervening second semiconductor layer 16. However, substantial further reduction in normalized on resistance could be attained if the first semiconductor layer 16 of Fig. 2A were to be used as an additional current path. Two alternate embodiments for accomplishing this function are shown in Figs. 2B and 2C. In these embodiments, a plurality of spaced apart semiconduc tor zones 16c, 16d of the second conductivity type here n type are located within that portion of the second semiconductor layer 16 extending from adjacent the channel region 20 to beneath the drain contact region 24. In Fig. 2B, these semiconductor zones are famed from stripshaped zones 1 6c which extend continuously from adjacent the channel region to beneath the drain contact region, while in Fig. 2C, each spaced apart semiconductor zone is formed from a first subzone 16d located adjacent the channel region and a second sub zone 1 6d1 which is spaced apart from the first subs zone and is located beneath the drain contact region.These spaced apart semiconductor zones 16c, 16d and 16d are n type zones having a typical doping level of about 1016 donors cm3. In Fig. 2B, the lateral extent of the semiconductor zones 16c is shown by reference numerals 16a and 16b to denote the left and right edges, respectively, of the zones. In Fig. 1, dotted lines are used to show where these left and right edges would appear in a cross section along the line I I of Fig. 2B if these semiconductor zones ere to be incorporated into the device of Fig. 1. As shown inFig. 1, the semiconductor zones extend in the vertical direction from the third se dcoriductor layer 18 18 down to the first semiconductor layer 14. fly means of these semiconductor zones, a connection is formed between the upper third and lower first semiconductor layers, so that tne first semiconductor layer is no longer floating, and can conu bute to device conduct vitv in the on state, thus lowering normalized on resis ance. In fact, normalized on resistance will be reduced by a factor of about 2 by including these semiconductor zones in the embodiment of Fig. 1.Additionally, by preventing the lower first semiconductor layer from floating by connecting it to the upper st third semiconductor layer, an additional advantage is obtained in that the avalanche breakdown voltage of the device will be increased. Furthermore , with these zones, the critical nature of the upper third semiconductor layer decreases, so that it can be made thinner. An additional embodiment of the invention, in which device conductivity is further im roved, is shown in Fig. 3. This device differs from the device shown in Fig. 1 basically in that the single gate and drain structure of Fig. 1 is replaced by a modified dual gate dual drain structure. .iDre particularly, lateral DOORS transistor 11 includes a second surface adjoining drain end region 40 of p type material, as well as a second surface adjoining channel region 36 of n type material which is controlled by a further gate electrode 46 G2 located over the second channel region.The embodiment of Fig. 3 also differs from the previously described embodiment of Fig. 1 in that the original drain contact region 24 hereinafter referred to as the first drain contact region for clarity now includes a p type surface region 38 withing the n type region 36, so that region 36 now also serves as a second surface adjoining channel region for the new portion on its right size , while the p type zone 38 serves as a further surfaceadjoining source region for the new portion of the device. A first drain electrode 44 contacts both source region 38 and region 36, and now serves as both a drain electrode D1 for the original portion of the device and as a source electrode S2 for the new portion.The purpose of this more complex dual gate dual drain structure is to enhance device conductivity in the on state by enabling the second p type semiconductor layer 16 to also contribute to device conductivity by conducting holes fran region 38, through the second channel region 36, the second drain end region 40 and the second semiconductor layer 16 back to source region 22. Electrode 28, which contacts both regions 20 and 22, now serves as both a source electrode S1 for the original portion of the device and as a drain electrode D2 for the new portion. Yet a further improvement in normalized on resistance may be achieved by combining the dual gate dual drain structure of Fig. 3 with the spaced apart semiconductor zones 1 6c or 16d d of Fig. 2B or 2C. In this manner all three semiconductor layers will contribute to device conductivity, thus achieving optimum normalized on resistance. Thus, by using a unique triple layer construction, the present invention provides a lateral E transistor which is capable of operating at high voltages in the source follower mode, while at the same tine providing a low normalized on resistance in a vertically compact and easily manufactured structure. Finally, while the invention has been particularly shown and described thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
