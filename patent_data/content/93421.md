# Metal treating method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a metal treating method of melting the periphery of the weld and removing the molten portion thereby to demount a metallic plate, partially welded on a metallic member, from a metallic member, the metal treating method comprises the steps of forming an electric arc between the hollow electrode rod and the metallic plate, melting the periphery of the weld of the metallic plate with the arc heat, sucking the molten metal with the hollow portion of the electrode rod as a suction passage. The metal treating apparatus comprises a hollow rod which is provided, at its tip end, with a hollow electrode rod, is urged onto the side of a metal to be treated by an elastic member, and can be freely moved longitudinally, a sliding block which is ruged in the same direction as that of the rod and can be freely moved longitudinally, an apparatus of causing the sliding block to be engaged with the rod to retreat the rod together with the sliding block, an apparatus for releasing the engagement relation with respect to the rod of the sliding block.
