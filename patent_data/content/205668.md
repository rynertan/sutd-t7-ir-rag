# Improved implantable prosthesis.

## Abstract
An improved implantable prosthesis, comprising a fluid or gell filled encasement made of silicone, the surface of which has sinusoidal shaped waves rather than a smooth configuration. The amplitude of the waves reduces under pressure of capsular contracture, thereby relieving said pressure without reducing the initial volume and firmness of the implant. The surface contact between prosthesis and surrounding tissue is also significantly reduced by the waves, improving the blood circulation.
