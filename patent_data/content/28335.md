# Multiprocessor system including I O interrupt handling mechanism.

## Abstract
For increased flexibility and efficiency of handling I O interrupt requests I O IR s in a multiprocessor system having a system controller SC, 22 , processors CP 20, 21 shared main storage 23 and in I O processor IOP in 24 , the IOP inserts I O IR entries onto the queues in MS in accordance with the type of interrupt which entries are only removed by the CPs, after their selection by the controller SC for execution of an appropriate interruption handling program. Bit positions in an I O IR pending register 46 in the SC are respectively assigned to the I O IR queues in MS, and their order determines queue priority for CP handling. An I O IR sets a corresponding bit position in register 46 an controls the corresponding queue entry. A broadcast bus 11 connects the bit positions of the pending register to each of the CPs.
