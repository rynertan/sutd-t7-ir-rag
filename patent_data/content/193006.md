# Method fo plasma initiated polymerization.

## Abstract
In a method for plasma initiated polymerization by the steps of exposing a vapor phase containing monomer vapor to a plasma and introducing a polymerization initiating active seed consequently produced into a condensate phase of monomer thereby effecting chain growth polymerization of the monomer, the improvement which comprises effecting the production of the polymer while keeping a radical polymerization initiator present at least in the aforemen tioned vapor phase.
