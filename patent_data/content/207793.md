# CRT control system.

## Abstract
There is described a picture quality control system for use with a multi beam cathode ray tube raster scan display device 24 . The display device generates an image comprising a multiplicity of parallel, nonoverlaping bands of pixels, each band of pixels comprising a set of parallel lines of pixels. The control system 26 includes a linearity correction circuit and a dynamic detwist correction circuit. The linearity correction circuit adjusts the distance between neighboring bands of pixels. The dynamic detwist correction circuit ad justs the relative positions of the electron beams generated by the cathode ray tube.
