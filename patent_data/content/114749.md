# Filler for heat sensitive recording paper.

## Abstract
Particulate material suitable for use as a filler in the heat sensitive recording layer of a heat sensitive recording paper comprises an amorphous silicate having a composi tion represented by the following oxide molecular ratio MO SiO₂ 0.01 1 to 1.1 1 wherein M represents at least one member selected from the group consisting of calcium, barium and zinc, or a product obtained by partially neutralising said silicate with carbon dioxide, said material having a BET specific surface area of 10 to 70 m² g and a bulk density of 0.14 to 0.30 g cc and also having such a secondary particle size distribution that secondary particles having a size smaller than 4 µm, as determined by the centrifugal precipitation method, constitute at least 70 by weight of the total particles.
