# Pulveriser.

## Abstract
A pulverizer for pulverizing solid material such as coal in which the chamber of the pulverizer has jets of fluid projected thereinto at high speed to cause the particles to impact against one another to effect the pulverizing and in which a sleeve is mounted within the pulverizer chamber so that the coarser particles which pass upwardly through the sleeve flow downwardly in the annular space between the sleeve and the chamber side wall, to be re entrained by the nozzles and projected again into the sleeve for further impacting.
