# Electrically conducting polymers and method of making.

## Abstract
The electrically conducting polymer includes poly N alkyl 3 min , 3 carbazolyl at least a portion of which is doped with a compatible charge transfer acceptor to provide p type electrical conductivity, and in which the alkyl group is of ethyl or methyl or a combination thereof. The method includes the steps of preparing a first solution comprising a Grignard reagent of at least a portion of a quantity of N alkyl 3 min , 3 dibromocarbazole monomer to be polymerized, preparing a second solution of the remainder of the monomer in a suitable solvent polymerizing a mixture of said first and said second solution in the presence of a suitable initiator for sufficient time to produce a high molecular weight polymer recovering said polymer and doping said polymer with a compatible charge transfer acceptor.
