# Electrode, cell and process for recovering metals.

## Abstract
An electrode for use in the deposition recovery of a metal of oxidation potential below hydrogen from an acidic solution, comprises an electrically conductive porous subs trate 3 , e.g. carbon, bearing on one surface thereof a fuel activating catalyst 4 , e.g. rhodium. The porosity of the substrate is sufficient that the current density at the surface 2 of the substrate 3 opposite the catalyst 4 will assure substantially complete depletion of metal ions very near the surface of the porous substrate, while the catalyst surface and the pores remain substantially free of deposited metal. Preferably the surface 2 carries an inert film or mesh 8, 9 on to which the metal deposits. Suitably the film mesh is detachable for ease of removal of deposited metal. The recovery process preferably employs a gas capable of hydrogen ion production, such as hydrogen or reformed natural gas. The process is especially suitable for recovering copper, silver and noble metals.
