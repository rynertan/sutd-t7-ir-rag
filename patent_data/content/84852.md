# SOLID FUEL STEEL CONSTRUCTION BOILER FOR DOMESTIC HEATING APPLICATIONS

## Abstract
The involved technical field is that of boilers, and the invention concerns a solid fuel steel construction boiler for domestic heating applications. The technical problem was that of providing a boiler wherein the combustion process could be controlled through an automatic control system. The solution provides for the interior space of the boiler, which is enclosed in a water curtain interspace, to be elongated vertically and divided into an upper zone 1a and lower zone 1b by a cradle 9 having an aperture 9a above which a burner is located which comprises a tube 10a perforated over its lower surface, air being delivered by an electric fan 17 controlled by an automatic control circuit into a chamber 19 whence primary air flows out toward the top portion of the upper zone 1a and secondary air is flown into the burner 10 . the lower zone 1b being connected to a smoke box 12 in communication with the chimney flue.
