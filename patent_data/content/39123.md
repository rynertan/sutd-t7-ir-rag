# Crystalline glucose and process for its production.

## Abstract
A product comprising a mixture of α and β forms of glucose as microcrystals, at least 70 of the glucose being in the form of the β isomer, dissolves readily in water to give approximately 60 solids solutions at ambient temperature. It is obtained by a process comprising the steps of 1 evaporating water from syrup at a pressure of less than 400 mg Hg to provide an at least 60 supersaturated solution of greater than 95 solids at a temperature of from 95 to 140 C 2 subjecting the supersaturated solution substantially instantaneously to a shear force to cause immediate nuclea tion of the syrup without cooling and 3 immediately forming the nucleated but substantially uncrystallised syrup into a quiescent layer and allowing the layer to crystallise substantially isothermally to produce solid crystalline glucose.
