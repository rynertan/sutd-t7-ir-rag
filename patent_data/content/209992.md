# Method and apparatus for ophthalmological surgery.

## Abstract
The invention contemplates use of a scanning laser char acterized by ultraviolet radiation to achieve controlled ablat ive photodecomposition of one or more selected regions of a cornea. Irradiated flux density and exposure time are so con trolled as to achieve desired depth of the ablation, which is a local sculpturing step, and the scanning action is coordinated to achieve desired ultimate surface change in the cornea. The scanning may be so controlled as to change the front surface of the cornea from a greater to a lesser spherical curvature, or from a lesser to a greater spherical curvature, thus effecting reduction in a myopic or in a hyperopic condition, without resort to a contact or other corrective auxiliary lens technique, in that the cornea becomes the corrective lens. The scanning may also be so controlled as to reduce astigmatism and to perform the precise incisions of a keratotomy. Still further, the scanning may be so controlled as to excise cornea tissue uni formly over a precisely controlled area of the cornea for preci sion accommodation of a corneal transplant.

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPHTHALMOLOG ICAL SURGERYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to that aspect of ophthalmological surgery which is concerned with operations upon the external surface of the cornea. Operations of the character indicated include corneal transplants and keratotomies such operations have traditionally required skilled manipulation of a cutting instrument. But, however keen the cutting edge, the mere entry of the edge into the surface of the cornea necessarily means a wedge like lateral pressure against body cells displaced by the entry, on both sides of the entry. Such lateral pressure is damaging to several layers of cells on both sides of the entry, to the extent impairing the ability of the wound to heal, and resulting in the formation of scar tissue. The CO2 laser has been employed in an effort to minimize such surgical damage to cells on severed sides of a given cut, as in the case of operations to remove a local skin defect. The beam of such a laser is characterized by a particular infrared wavelength 10.6 microns , and controlled local ablation or incision of the cornea is achieved, without developing any lateral pressure upon cells adjacent to the margins of ablation. However, the operation is not performed without side effects, in that the ablation or incision is thermally achieved, through photocoagulation and or photovaporization cells adjacent the ablated or incised margin are charred. And even with lasers emitting in the visible spectrum, the effect is still largely thermal in nature.For example, for visible laser irradiation of the skin at about 532.0 nanometers 0.532 micron , namely, in the pea green portion of the visible spectrum, histological examination reveals evidence of cellular dehydration i.e., cellular retraction with formation of tissue clefts, pyknotic nuclei at energy densities where ablation can be accomplished thus, at an energy level needed for ablation or incision with such radiation, charring cellular damage is observed at the site of the incision and is an indication of substrate heating. On the other hand, radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths is characterized by high photon energy, and this energy is greatly effective on impact with tissue, in that molecules of tissue are decomposed on photon impact, resulting in tissue ablation by photodecomposition. Molecules at the irradiated surface are broken into smaller volatile fragments without heating the remaining substrate the mechanism of the ablation is photochemical, i.e., the direct breaking of intra molecular bonds. Photothermal and or photocoagulation effects are neither characteristic nor observable in ablations at ultraviolet wavelengths, and cell damage adjacent the photodecomposed ablation is insignificant.BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus and technique for surgically operating upon the outer surface of the cornea. Another object of the invention is to provide apparatus and technique for surgically modifying optical properties of the eye through surgical procedure on the outer surface of the cornea. It is a specific object to provide surgical techniques and apparatus for reducing a myopic, for reducing a hyperopic, and or for reducing an astigmatic condition of an eye. Another specific object is to provide an improved surgical technique in performing corneal transplant operations. A still further specific object is to provide automatic means for safely applying ultraviolet irradiation in surgical procedures on the cornea. The invention achieves these objects with apparatus which effectively fixes the position of an eye with respect to a scanning laser characterized by ultraviolet radiation, at an energy level capable of achieving controlled ablative photodecomposition of the cornea, namely, of the epithelium, Bowman s membrane, and stroma levels of the cornea. Irradiated flux density and exposure time are so controlled as to achieve desired depth of the ablation, which is a local sculpturing step, and the scanning action is coordinated to achieve desired ultimate surface change in the cornea.The scanning may be so controlled as to change the front surface of the cornea from a greater to a lesser spherical curvature, or from a lesser to a greater spherical curvature, thus effecting reduction in a myopic or in a hyperopic condition, without resort to a contact or other corrective auxiliary lens technique, in that the cornea becomes the corrective lens. The scanning may also be so controlled as to reduce astigmatism, and to perform the precise incisions of a radial or other keratotomy. Still further, the scanning may be so controlled as to excise corneal tissue uniformly over a precisely controlled area of the cornea for precision accommodation of a corneal transplant.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention will be illustratively described in detail, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram in perspective, to show the general arrangement of operative components of the invention Fig. 2 is a simplified view in longitudinal section, showing an eye retaining fixture used with the apparatus of Fig. 1 Figs. 3 and 4 are simplified diagrams to illustrate different scan patterns performed with apparatus as in Fig. 1 Figs. 5 and 6 are simplified sectional views to illustrate different sculptured surface curvatures achieved with either of the scan patterns of Figs.3 and 4 Figs. 7 and 8 are views in section, and Fig. 1 is a view in front elevation, to illustrate use of the invention in a corneal transplant operation Figs. 10, 10A and 10B are views in front elevation to illustrate use of the invention in different keratotomy operations Figs. 11 and 12 are, respectively, a view in front elevation and an enlarged half section profile diagram to illustrate a Fresnel cut use of the invention Fig. 13 is a schematic diagram to illustrate apparatus modified to perform an astigmatism correcting operation and Fig. 14 is a view similar to Figs. 3 and 4, to illustrate an astigmatism correcting operation with the apparatus of Fig. 13. In Fig. 1, clamp means 10 is shown for fixed retention of the head of a patient reclined, face up such that the eye 11 to be operated upon is fixedly aligned with a downwardly folded portion 12 of the central axis 12 of beam output from a stationary laser device 13, and scanner means 14 is provided for pro grammed deflection of laser beam output, with respect to the central axis 12. The laser device 13 is served by a suitable power supply 15, and the scanner means 14 includes selectively operable control means, suggested by legend, for determining scan pattern, effective limits of scan action, and, if desired, the timevarying profile of one or more dimensional components of scan action. Preferably, the clamp means 10 includes means, symbolized at 17, to stabilize the patient s head via opposed engagements at the region of his temples, and an eye retaining fixture 18, Fig. 3 peripherally engages eye 11 at the corneal scleral area. Also preferably, an optical fixation device 20 is adjustably fixed, as to the housing of scanner 14. Illustratively, device 20 includes a device 20 includes a sighting reticle and lens, whereby the eye 11 not being operated upon can view the reticle as if at infinity the sighting alignment 21 for device 20 is parallel to the axis 12, and it will be understood that adjustable means not shown may provide an adjustable offset, as needed for accommodation of the patient s interpupilary distance and to adapt to the particular mounted offset of device 20 from axis 12. For an operation on the other eye 11 , the eye 11 will be available for similar fixation, in conjunction with another fixation device not shown and associated adjustably offsetting means alternatively, the fixation device 20 may be adjustably mounted at correct offset on the opposite side of scanner 14. For purposes of operating on eye 11 , clamp means 10 will have been indexed laterally with respect to laser 13 to the extent aligning axis 12 with the eye 11 then to be operated upon, thereby positioning eye 11 for use of the fixation device. The eye retaining fixture 18 of Fig. 2 is seen to comprise a hollow annulus, having a convergent axial end wall 23 of air permeable material contoured to engage and retain the eye via a scleral corneal region. A side port connection 24 to a vacuum pump enables retention of eye engagement to wall 23, and outward lug or flange means 25 enables rigid aligned and spaced connection of fixture 18 to laser 13 and its scanner 14 via means suggested by legend in Fig.2, such means being omitted from Fig. 1 for reasons of more simplified showing. The laser selecte for use at 13 preferably emits in the ultraviolet, namely, at wavelengths of less than substantially 400 nanometers. Such emissions for gas lasers are characteristically at 351 nm for xenonfluoride lasers, 337 nm for nitrogen lasers, 308 nm for xenon chloride lasers, 248 nm for krypton fluoride lasers, 193 nm for argon fluoride lasers, and 157 nm for fluorine lasers and within this range, frequencydoubling techniques applied to other lasers. including crystal lasers, provide further alternative sources. One of the existing commercial excimer laser products of Lambda Physik GmbH, Gottingen, Germany, for example their Model EMG 103 operating with argonfluoride, is satisfactory for use as laser 13 for this product, maximum energy per pulse is 200 millijoules, with a pulse repetition rate of 200 per second, 3 X 105 shots being available from a single charge of the involved gas, before reducing to 50 percent of specified power at this repetition rate, it being noted that full rated power is not necessarily required in use of the present invention. Pulse width is about 15 nanoseconds, and typical beam dimensions at 25 centimeters 10 inches are 10 mm x 22 mm.To bring this down to an illustratively useful rounded square spot size of 0.5 mm by 0.5 mm at the eye 11, corrective lens elements at 26, as of quartz, calcium fluoride, or magnesium fluoride, will be understood to include a cylindrical element and a spherical element whereby beam size is reduced while the rectangular section is compressed to substantially square section. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate alternative scan patterns for having the typical half millimeter focused and repetitively pulsed spot of the laser beam course the surface of eye 11 in the performance of a surgical procedure. The circle 30 in Fig. 3 may illustratively be of 6 mm diameter at the cornea, and centered on the axis of eye 11. The scan action is rectilineal, involving plural horizontal line scans with progressive vertical displacement to cover the field, here shown limited to the circle 30. For this purpose, a suitable scanner, known as icroscan 771 , is commercially available from Laser Industries, International, Hendon,England and therefore need not be here described in detail.It suffices to say that the control means 16 associated with such a scanner includes a microprocessor with memory for delineated boundary limits of scan, such as the limiting circle 30. The delineation can be to the surgeon s desired boundary contours, and the scan speed and direction may be programmed or manually controlled. What has been said as to Fig. 3 also applies toFig. 4, except that a spiral course of scan, i.e., rotary sweeps at progressively changing radius, is involved in each coverage of the delineated field 30 . It is a feature of the invention that the programming of scan action be such that predetermined depth of ultraviolet laser incision be made to effectively recharacterize the external contour of the cornea within the entire predetermined field boundary e.g., 30, 30 . This is done by progressive precise photodecomposition of the corneal tissue, as to a depth limit of 0.35 mm. In the illustrative argon fluoride laser referenced above, a precise volume of tissue e.g., 14 microns deep may be excised for each laser pulse or shot, and the half millimeter spot, repeated at 200 second, can cover the entire area within the delineated boundary 30, in about fifteen seconds. For the situation depicted in Fig. 5, the dashed line 31 represents the ultimate curvature to which the external surface of a cornea 32 may be modified to achieve a change in optical properties of the involved eye, here illustratively a myopic eye, for which the reduced curvature 31 offers a diopter reducing corrective effect, all without resort to the use of a spectacle lens or a contact lens to achieve the result. To achieve the curve 31, the minimum desired photodecomposition is at the outer boundary 30, and the maximum is at the center.This is achievable by programming the microprocessor to progressively reduce the radius of the boundary circle 30 i.e., progressively reduce the area of scanned field , for successive scans of the reducing field. If the curvature 31 requires a maximum depth of 0.35 mm of cornea removal at the center, this means that the central region of the cornea i.e., the last and most reduced scanned field will have been scanned twenty five times, and that cornea removal outside this most reduced scanned field will have involved lesser numbers of scans, the progression having been predetermined to achieve the desired ultimate curvature 30 over the area 31. What has been said as to the scan technique ofFig. 3 to achieve curvature 31 applies equally for use of the spiral scan of Fig. 4, the field 30 again being programmed for automatic reduction as necessary to provide maximum cornea removal at the center, and minimum at outer limits of the circular boundary. What has been said as to programming to achieve lesser curvature in the outer surface of the cornea Fig. 5 , to reduce a myopic condition, applies also to Fig. 6 for reduction of a hyperopic condition. InFig. 6, the difference lies in programming field scans so as to initiate and progressively enlarge a central area which defines the inner limit of field scanned.Thus, except for perhaps one field scan involving cornea removal over the entire area bounded by circle 30 30 , all remaining field scanned areas are annular, with progressively increasing inner radius of each successively scanned annular field. The last such field will necessarily be virtually a circular line at the diameter of circle 30 30 , along which circular line the depth of surgical excision will have been greatest, as indicated by dashed line 33 in the cornea 34 of Fig. 6. Quite aside from the variable depth character of the removal of corneal tissue Figs. 5 and 6 , the invention also lends itself to uniform depth removals, over the entire area of a multiply scanned constant field. In Figs. 7 and 9, the cornea of an eye 11 is subjected to a succession of scans of i.e., within a constant predetermined field area 35.In the illustrative laser case, with excision to a depth of 14 microns for each pulse, a uniform depth of 0.35 mm is achieved by 25 scans of the total area 34, to produce a carved base or floor curvature 36 for reception and location of a corneal transplant. Further with respect to a corneal transplant procedure, the described apparatus will be seen to be further useful, as in preparation of the corneal insert to be implanted at and within the recess 36.A donated eye may be reversibly held to a fixture as described at 18 in Fig. 2 by reversible it is meant that, depending upon the manner of mounting flange 25, either the epithelium or the endothelium of the donated eye may be mounted for upward exposure to the laser beam 12, it being understood that for the latter situation with the donated eye, iris and other regions not needed for corneal scleral mounting and for corneal operation will have been initially removed. A preferred procedure is first to so expose to laser scanning the concave inner side of the donated cornea such scanning is to an extent achieved by multiple scans of a full circular field exceeding the diameter of recess 36 sufficient to remove tissue at least to a uniform depth within the stroma, whereupon the mounting of fixture 18 and its partially machined corneal workpiece is reversed, to expose to laser scanning the convex outer side of the donated cornea.Scanning the outer side consists of two steps first, multiple scans of the full circular field exceeding the diameter of recess 36 , thereby excising at least the epithelium and to a depth which preferably achieves a transplant thickness T1 exceeding the depth T2 of recess 36 second, scanner 14 is operated in a line cutting mode wherein successive laser pulses sequentially advance along the circumference of a circle designed for precise acceptance in the circular recess 36, until full severance of the circular cut out, which then becomes the prepared transplant. Upon implanting, donated stroma is placed in full endotheliumfree contact with the patient s prepared stroma, and the implant may be sutured. Later, upon removal of sutures, the outer surface of the eye 11 and its transplant 27 will have the appearance shown in Fig.8, wherein the transplant projects beyond adjdcent areas of the patient s cornea, and this projecting surface of the transplant may be reduced by laser scanning to a finish contour 28 of preferably flush marginal conformance with non sculptured adjacent tissue of the patient s eye. It will be further understood that, subject to the surgeon s decision, such a finishing cut may be to a curvature which does or does not effect a predetermined change in optical performance of the eye. Fig. 10 illustrates a modified use of the described apparatus, as for developing the plural angularly spaced radial cuts 37 involved in a radial keratotomy, all within a predefined circular limit 38. Depending upon the severity of the condition which calls for a keratotomy procedure, the depth of radial cuts 37 may exceed the 0.35 mm depth illustratively given for Figs. 5 to 8. Certain myopic and hyperopic conditions may be so severe that to produce merely an excised single surface 31 or 33 could involve, in the surgcon s considered judgment, an excessive removal of tissue, at the involved region of necessarily deepest cut.For such a situation, the invention offers the option of programming successive scans in a manner to create a Fresnel type stepped development of the desired ultimate curvature. Such a situation and procedure are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 12, wherein an ulti mately reduced curvature surface 31 of Fig. 5 dashed line 41 in Fig. 12 is achieved in annular increments within the field area bounded at 30. In the outer one of these annuli 42 , the curvature and depth of cut are precisely as would have applied to generate the continuous curve 41 i.e., without Fresnel steps .But the intermediate annular area 43 effectively achieves a continuation of curve 41 with much less volume of corneal excision. Finally, the inner circular area 44 effectively completes curve 41, with minimal removal of corneal tissue. The removal of tissue at the center is denoted d44 for the Fresnel cut 44 of Figs. 11 and 12 and comparatively, is but a small fraction of the maximum removal depth 41 which would be needed to achieve the same optical correction with the smoothly developed corrected single curvature surface 41. It will be understood that for the Fresnel type cut as illustrated in Fig. 12, the previously described illustrative halfmillimeter spot size will be incapable of achieving the desired result, for the one millimeter radial increments shown in Fig. 12. To produce the requisite resolution for characterizing increments of curvature 41 at 42, 43, 44, it is necessary to employ a smaller spot size.For the indicated Lambda Physik equipment, spot size reduction is feasible via means 26 as far as to produce a 30 micron spot size, if necessary with this capability, it is seen that the one millimeter radius increments of annulus 42 and annulus 43 are each achievable with a resolution of about 35 radial steps per increment 42 or 43 . It will thus be understood that numbers given above are for purposes of more simplified illustration of this and the other aspects of the present invention. In the discussion thus far, an excimer laser has been the illustrative source of an ablating beam, and it has been generally indicated that other lasers are available as alternative sources in the desired ultraviolet region and at presently suitable energy levels, and these other lasers will emit continuously for periods of controlled duration. For example, an organic dye laser utilizing the proper organic dye can be made to produce laser emission in the region of 380 nm when pumped by an ultraviolet laser source such as a continuous wave neodymium YAG laser operating at 266 nm in this case, the organicdye laser emission at 380 nm can be frequency doubled by a proper non linear crystal such as a potassiumtitanium phosphate XTP crystal to an emission wavelength of 190 nm. The showing of Figs. 1 to 5 will thus be understood to illustrate the further case wherein ultraviolet laser radiation on axis 12 is of continuouswave nature, for programmed exposure and scan control at 15, such that the per unit time exposure of a given element of scanned area on a given scan deflected pass of the elemental area involves beam exposure flux at a level at which resultant corneal tissue ablation per scan is to an ascertained elemental depth which is but a fraction of desired maximum ablation into the stroma region of the cornea. The desired maximum ablation therefore results from programmed exposure to successive continuous wave scans of the local area requiring deepest incision, to effect the desired corrected anterior surface profile of the cornea.And it will be understood that continuous wave scanning is also equally applicable to the various sculpting purposes and techniques described in connection withFigs. 7 to 12. Figs. 13 and 14 illustrate applicability of the invention to the correction of an astigmatism which has been identified in a particular eye. In this situation, the anterior surface of the untreated eye exhibits a cylindrical component of curvature which is a departure from otherwise generally spherical curvature, and the orientation of the axis of cylindrical curvature is at a particular angular orientation a with respect to the central vertical axis of the eye. Fig. 14 indicates this angle a in the context of a circular area of perimeter P to be subjected to astigmatism correcting laser scanning ablation. For the depicted illustrative case, area scanning of progressively changed areas utilizes a rectilinear X Y coordinate drive 50 of scanner 14, wherein the orientation of the X Y coordinate system can be angularly adjusted by selectively operable means symbolized by a knob 51 having associated means 52 to indicate the angle a setting appropriate to the eye 11 requiring correction.The X Y coordinate scan drive 50 is shown under control of microprocessor means 53, with indication that means 53 is programmable to govern a sequence of scanned areas, at the preset angle a. For discussion purposes, it is indicated inFig. 14 that adjusted angular displacement of the X Y components of scan action establishes the linescan orientation L for the line scan component and the transverse offset S for the line displacement component of rectilinear scan, plus and minus directions being shown for the transverse offset S, with respect to a central alignment of symmetry in the L direction. Pulse control or gating means 54 is shown with input connections from the scan drive means 50 and from microprocessor means 53, and with an output connection 55 to determine gated on off control of laser output in the course of area scanning. More specifically, and assuming the case of progressive reduction of scanned areas to reduce the astigmatism, a first area scan may be effected by a succession of parallel L oriented sweeps, at incremental advance of transverse offset S, commencing with a first short chordal sweep S1, and progressing across almost the full circular area within perimeter P until termination of the first area scan at the symmetrically opposite short chordal sweep 51 thereby ablating a first slightly truncated area within perimeter P to a first incremental depth in the cornea.On the next area coverage, the limiting outer parallel truncations, 52 and 52 apply, to create a second area of incremental ablating intrustion which symmetrically laps and is therefore cumulative with all but the outer increment of truncations, from 51 to S2, and from Sl.to S2. In like fashion, successive area scans are at progressively shrinking spans between symmetrically inwardly displaced parallel truncations, S3 S3 , and so on, until the final area scan is of line or virtually line thickness, namely, when scanning the laser beam essentially only on the central axis of symmetry, on axis L. The net result of cumulative ablation is to achieve desired maximum depth of sculptured cut on the central axis of symmetry, at the preset orientation a, with depth of cut which gradually reduces to a minimum at the outer truncation lines S1 S1 . It will be understood that the sculptured profile of cut may be cylindrical, t the extent of effecting a prescribed number of diopters of cylindrical correction, depending upon the programming of scan area reduction predetermined at 53.And it will be further understood that the same kind of cumulative ablative sculpture to achieve a cylindrical surface correction can be obtained for a program of successive area scanning wherein the first scanned area is narrow and on the central axis L of symmetry, with area expansion between widening limits of the parallel truncations, to the point of finally scanning at the shortest and outermost truncations S1 and 51 of the area described by perimeterP. In use of the invention for laser surgery upon an eye having need for both astigmatic and spherical correction, it is preferred that the astigmatic correction, described in connection with Figs. 13 and 14, be the first of two procedures. This is considered advantageous because astigmatic errors are generally not as severe as spherical errors, so that fewer diopters of cylindrical curvature ablation will be involved than for the subsequent spherical correction procedure.Furthermore, to have eliminated or substantially eliminated the astigmatism in a first procedure is to have constituted the anterior surface of the cornea to an essentially spherical surface, which be it myopic or hyperopic in nature is more assuredly correctively sculpted to the desired profile also spherical for emmetropia vision, particularly where, as is the case of this invention, all ablativelaser area scans are e fectively centered on the optical axis of the eye. It will be seen that the described methods and apparatus achieve all stated objects and provide readily controlled procedure for correcting eye abnormalities attributable to cornea curvature. The ablative penetration of laser beam action may be kept to a relatively harmless fraction of the thickness of the cornea, and whatever the depth of invasion, a natural body process provides protective epithelium coverage of the sculpted region, within a few days after an operation. The programmable coordination of scan area size and shape circular, annular, or truncated in conjunction with unit time exposure at given sizes and shapes will produce predictable and controlled changes in curvature, whereby cylindrical errors and or spherical errors may be eliminated or substantially reduced, to the enhanced comfort and convenience of the patient. While the invention has been descrbed in detail for various illustrative embodiments and modes, it will be understood that modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.For example, what has been described above as manual means 51 to preset the angle at which astigmatic correction is to be achieved, may in fact be an automatically driven setting of the astigmaticcorrection angle, wherein the angle input data for making the automatic drive is produced by a diagnostic system or method as described in my copending European patent application no.86304097.8 filed May 29, 1986. Also, it will be understood that, although preferred, it is not necessary to limit area scanning to the circular perimeter P when sculpting for astigmatism correction. The circle perimeter P represents a preferred minimum area of ablative sculpture, being that maximum circular area involved for sight under dilated pupil conditions, e.g., about 7 mm diameter. However, the corneal area outside this perimeter P is not required for best central sight and therefore no opticall related harm results if the scanning procedure is such as to abate in regions outside perimeter P. Thus, in Fig. 13, it is not strictly necessary that pulse control means 54 shall have the Nenvelope limited i.e., perimeter P limiting function suggested by legend. In other words, a purely rectangular accomplishment of all area scans, from a single line area on the axis L of symmetry to outer limits S1 and S1 of successively expanding scanned rectangular areas, will accomplish the same optical result, at perhaps a slight degradation of cosmetic appearance. Still further, it will be understood that the radial keratotomy described in connection with Fig. 10 is illustrative of but one of a variety of keratotomy procedures to which the invention is applicable. For example, because of the great precision with which laser scan action can be microprocessor controlled, the keratotomy may include concentric circle loci of ablative incision, and the circular incisions may be full circle or in a distributed pattern of circular arcs, in angularly interlaced array, as shown in Fig. 10A, the full circles or the circular arcs being with or without connected or disconnected radial incisions, as the surgeon may deem best for his particular patient s purposes. Also, as illustrated in Fig. 10B, a radial keratotomy may be implemented, again with microprocessor control of scan action with further incisions as at 60 transverse to, and preferably not intersecting with, a particular orientation of radial incisions 61, where the radial incisions 61 are oriented to accord with the axis for which an astigmatic correction is to be made.
