# ROM EMULATOR FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTER

## Abstract
A diagnostic test system for microprocessor based elec tronics systems comprises a computer 10 and a ROM emula tor 20 for emulating the read only memory in the device under test 38 which provides the microprocessor 36 with its start up operating program. The ROM emulator 20 gains control of the microprocessor 36 in the device under test and causes it to run a series of diagnostic tests which are controlled from the test unit computer 10 . Unique capture logic circuitry 26 in the ROM emulator 20 permits test data to be read over the system address bus.
