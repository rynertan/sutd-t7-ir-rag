## Abstract
In a heated rear windscreen 10 for a motor vehicle, in order to reduce the manufacturing cost, the silk screen printed conductors 14 and the interconnection areas 16 are made from a non precious metal such as aluminium. The terminal areas 18, on the other hand, are made of a silver ceramic material to enable a satisfactory solder bond to be made with the overlying electric leads 22.
