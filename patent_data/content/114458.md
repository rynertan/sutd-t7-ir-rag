# Fuel fired burner assembly.

## Abstract
The assembly comprises a fuel supply conduit 2 terminating in a nozzle 1 which extends with annular clearance 8a into a combustion chamber 7 located within a tunnel 3 . The nozzle 1 is provided with radially directed outlet passages 18 which convey the fuel from the conduit 2 to the clearance 8a where the fuel mixes with air entering the clearance 8a from passages 15, 16 and 8b . These passages are formed between the tunnel body 3 , an outer tunnel sleeve 11 and an intermediate sleeve 14 between the body 3 and the sleeve 11 . The nozzle 1 is also provided with a through going aperture 19 which is located between two adjacent fuel ports 18 and which is axially offset from the nozzle axis. Extending through the aperture 19 with annular clearance 20 is an electrically operated flame detection probe 21 whose electrode tip 22 is disposed within the central section 6 of the tunnel 3 . The annular clearance 20 permits a residual supply of air to enter the tunnel 3 from the clearance 8b independently of the clearance 8a . The residual air supply flows around the probe 21 to form a cone of flame which enables an electrical current to be passed through the probe 21 between its tip 22 and the metallic earthed tunnel 3 .
