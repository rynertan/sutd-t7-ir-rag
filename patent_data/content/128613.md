## Description
Roof element made from concrete. The invention relates to a roof element made from concrete comprising a bottom plate and longitudinally and transversely extending adjoining ribs standing on the bottom plate. Concrete plates provided on at least one side with ribst integral with the concrete plate for reinforcement are known per se. The invention has for its object to provide such a concrete plate which is suitable for use as a roof element for a building, for example, a house or the like. According to the invention this can be achieved by coating the side faces of the standing ribs as well as the parts of the bottom plate intermediate between the ribs with insulating material and by providing the roof element on the side remote from the bottom plate with a layer of insulating material covering the free ends of the ribs and at least substantially the whole surface of the roof element. By using the method embodying the invention a comparatively light weight, yet strong roof element can be obtained, which has a high insulation value, whilst on the layer of insulating material covering at least substantially the whole surface of the roof element further roofings or the like can be readily arranged. For example, according to a further aspect of the invention recesses may be provided in the insulating material for holding laths to which are secured tile laths extending across the insulating material. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to an embodiment of a roof element in accordance with the invention shown in the accompanying Figures. Fig. 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a roof element embodying the invention. Fig. 2 is a plan view of part of the roof element of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken on the line III III in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view of an end of a roof element. The roof element illustrated in the Figures comprises a bottom plate 1 made from concrete and being integral with ribs 2 and 3 extending in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the bottom plate and being perpendicular to the plane of the bottom plate 1. Along the outer edges of the bottom plate 1 longitudinal ribs 4 and transverse ribs 5 are provided, the width of which is larger than that of the further longitudinal and transverse ribs, whilst said ribs 4 and 5 are bevelled near their ends remote from the bottom plate 1 with the exception of the ends near the longitudinal and transverse ribs, where protruding noses 6 and 7 respectively are provided in line with said ribs. In order to ensure sufficient carrying capacity of this concrete element the bottom plate 1 and or the ribs include a normal reinforcement or a prestressed reinforcement. In the embodiment shown the spaces 8 bounded by the ribs 3 and 5 and the intermediate longitudinal ribs 2, measured in the direction of length of the roof element are appreciably smaller than the spaces 9 bounded by the ribs 2 and 3. In a similar manner the spaces 10 bounded by the ribs 4 at the longitudinal edges and the neighbouring longitudinal ribs 2, viewed in the direction of width of the element, are also considerably smaller than the spaces 9 bounded by the ribs 2 and 3. Between each set of transverse ribs 3 said space 10 is subdivided by a rib II extending parallel to said transverse ribs. Every space 8 is filled out with a block of insulating material 12, which is integral with a superjacent plate shaped part 13, to the underside of which is furthermore joined a trianglesection part 14 integral with the plate shaped part 13, which fills out the space between two neighbouring noses 7. From the Figures it will be apparent that the plate shaped part 13 bears by its edges on the free top ends of longitudinal and transverse ribs 2 and 3, which ribs are covered by approximately half the width by the plateshaped part 13. In a similar manner the cavities 10 are filled out with blocks 15 of insulating material, which are integral with plateshaped parts 16 and triangle section extensions 17. For the corners of the roof element matching blocks of insulating material can be used, which comprise a part received in a recess 18 and two orthogonal, triangle section parts received in the spaces 19 and 20, as well as a plate shaped part interconnecting said parts of insulating material and forming part of the layer of insulating material covering the whole surface of the roof element together with said plates 13 and 16 and further plate shaped parts to be described hereinafter. In the spaces 9 the bottom plate is covered by plates 21 of insulating material having rims 22 in contact with the side faces of the ribs 2 and 3, said rims being provided at the top edge on the outer circumference with grooves. Between the rims 22, which are integral with the plate 21 reinforcing ribs 23 and 24 integral with the plate 21 extend in the longitudinal transverse directions of the roof element. The grooves accommodate the ends of plates 25 and 26 of insulating material contacting the standing walls of the ribs 2 and 3, said plates being integral with one another and with a plateshaped part 27 of insulating material. The lower face of the plateshaped part is provided between the plates 25 and 26 with reinforcing ridges 28 and 29 extending in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the roof element and being integral with the parts 25 to 27. From Fig. 4, in particular, it will appear that the lower ends of the plates 25 and 26 lie in the grooves in the rims 22, whilst the edges of the plate shaped part 27 bear on the top faces of the longitudinal and transverse ribs 2 and 3 and adjoin neighbouring, similar plate shaped parts 27 and or the plate shaped parts 13. It will be obvious that in this manner the plate shaped parts 13 and 27 extending parallel to the bottom plate 1 constitute a plate of insulating material covering the whole surface of the roof element. Such an element, as is shown in Figs. 1 and 4, can be disposed on partition walls 30 of a building. When the building has to be provided with a tile roof, the plates 13 and 27 of synthetic resin forming the top surface of the roof element may have recessed grooves adapted to receive laths 31. Preferably these laths are arrnaged opposite the ends of the transverse ribs 3 so that the load on these laths will be directly transferred to the transverse ribs 3. Tile laths 32 can then be fastened to the laths for supporting tiles 33 shown schematically. For manufacturing the above described roof element the parts of synthetic resin described above are arrnaged in a suitable mould and fastened and, if desired, glued to one another. Then the concrete part of the roof element can be poured in the mould, the parts of insulating material described serving so to say at the same time as a waste casing for the concrete plate provided with longitudinal and transverse ribs. As a matter of course supplements and or modifications of the embodiment described above are conceivable within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, in order to provide spaces for French windows or attic windows recesses can be made in the element during the manufacture for example, by arranging a suitable partition in the mould at the area of the opening to be left, which partition can be removed afterwards. Instead of using the laths and tile laths described, recesses can be made in the top surface of the top layer of insulating material of the roof element for accommodating supporting noses of the tiles, which are thus directly supported by the top layer of insulating material of the roof element. As a matter of course, other roofing materials may be arranged on the top layer of insulating material of the roof element. In the embodiment shown more or less dish shaped elements formed by the parts 21 to 24 and 25 to 29 are used for obtaining the recesses 9 between the ribs. As a matter of course, alo for this purpose correspondingly shaped elements consisting of a solid block may be used. The insulating material is preferably expanded polystyrene foam or a similar foam like insulating material. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain more clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction concerning the interpretation of the invention
