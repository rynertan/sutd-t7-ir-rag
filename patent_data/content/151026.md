## Description
A Method for Producing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Image Data. The present invention relates to a method for producing two and or three dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance image data, which data represent some function of the spin density distribution, the spin lattice relaxation time T1 and the spin spin relaxation time T2 of particular protons within a target. Many different techniques are currently being investigated by which a characteristic image of a target can be effectively and efficiently obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging. Typically, the characteristic sought to be obtained is some function of the spin density distribution, the spin lattice relaxation time T1 and the spin spin relaxation time T2 of particular protons within the target. These protons are first excited by application of a magnetic field and a radio frequency RF pulse. Protons thus excited tend subsequently to relax, and during the process of relaxing generate a free induction decay FID signal. The above characteristic function of the relaxing protons within the target may be obtained by a Fourier trans for mation of this FID signal. One particular nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technique, called echo planar imaging, is disclosed in Mansfield and Pykett,Biological and Medical Imaging by NMR, 29 J. Magnetic Resonance 355 1978 . The Mansfield et al. article discloses a technique of echo planar imaging in which a target is first subjected to a uniform magnetic field, thereby aligning protons within that target in a single direction commensurate with the direction of the uniform magnetic field. This direction may, for example, be aligned along the z axis of the target. The Mansfield et al.echo planar imaging technique simultaneously subjects the target to a linear magnetic gradient. As a result, although all protons are aligned along the z axis of the target, the magnetic field to which the protons are subjected varies along the z axis of the target. Thus, for any small range of z values, n Z 4 with appropriate units, all protons in the xy plane at z n are subject to approximately the same magnitude magnetic field, whereas protons in the xy plane at z rn 1 and z n 1 are subject to a smaller and larger magnetic field, respectively. Next, according to Mansfield et al., the target is subjected to a radio frequency RF pulse which is tailored, that is has a specific band of frequencies, to excite protons in a single xy plai.e, for example the xy plane at z n. More specifically, to excite only these protons, the RF pulse is chosen to have a frequency spectrum corresponding to the Larmor angular frequency wol of the protons given by the formula wO tB, where B is the magnitude of the magnetic field determined by the z coordinate, and t is the magnetogyric ratio of the protons under investigation. At this point, the protons of the target are fully excited and begin to relax, thereby giving off an FID signal. The Mansfield et al. echo planar imaging technique continues by removing the linear gradient, and attempts to further influence the excited protons so that a signal representing the spin density distribution of the protons in the xy plane at z n may be obtained by a one dimensional Fourier transformation of the observed FID signal. Basically, Mansfield et al. appears to try to project the spin densities of protons lying in a discrete array in the xy plane onto a single line. Mansfield et al. promotes the use of a square wave or a switched gradient along one axis and a steady gradient along another to achieve a condition whereby a one dimensional Fourier transformation may be used.The actual transformation contemplated is, however, not clearly disclosed in Mansfield et al. In Mansfield et al. the switched gradient is reported capable of being replaced by a cosine waveform to good approximation, but there is no disclosure of how a suitable one dimensional transformation can be selected if the switched gradient is so replaced. Mansfield et al. also asserts that a complete three dimensional spin density distribution can be calculated in a single step, but such calculation is not disclosed. In summary, Mansfield et al. requires the use of a switched gradient magnetic field to project spin densities onto a single line. However, Mansfield et al. realizes that a switched gradient field cannot be achieved in actual practice. Accordingly,Mansfield et al. suggests that a cosine waveform gradient can be used to good approximation of the switched gradient. Nevertheless, Mansfield et al. appears to rely on a single line projection Fourier transformation technique suitable for the square wave switched gradient , without considering the applicability of such technique when cosine waveform gradients are used. A Mansfield et al. echo planar technique is analyzed in a later publication by Tropper, Image Reconstruction for NMR EchoPlanar Technique, and for a Proposed Adaptation to Allow ContinuousData Acquisition, 42 J. Magnetic Resonance 193 1981 . Tropper considers the need to modify the Fourier transformation analysis ofMansfield et al. when cosine waveform gradients are employed. TheTropper analysis includes an explicit formulation for solving theFourier transformation required when cosinusoidal gradients are used, but this formulation is sufficiently complex that practical application does not seem desirable. The present invention seeks to provide an improved method for producing nuclear magnetic resonance image data. According the present invention provides, in a first aspect, a method of producing nuclear magnetic resonance image data which represent a characteristic of a target, comprising the steps of a. exciting the target with a magnetic field and a radio frequency pulse b. applying at least one time varying magnetic field gradient to the target c. collecting data from the target during the step of applying the at least one time varying magnetic field gradient, by acquiring a data signal from target which data signal is dependent on the values of a Fourier transform of the characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points in the Fourier space occupied by the Fourier transform d. determining the positions of the data signal sample points on a path in the Fourier space which path is defined as a constant times the integral of the time varying gradient e. interpolating the value of the data signals at a plurality of Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space using the positions and values of the data signal at the sample points in theFourier space and f. converting the value of the data signals at theCartesian grid points in the Fourier space by Fourier transform to a spatial domain to produce the image data of the characteristic of the target. The first data signal can be defined as being dependent in value on the values of the Fourier transform of the characteristic plus the spatial derivative of that Fourier transform. To provide a correction factor which eliminates the effect of these spatial derivatives, an alternative method of the invention provides as follows a method of producing nuclear magnetic resonance image data which represents a characteristic of a target, comprising the steps of a. exciting the target with a magnetic field and a radio frequency pulse b. applying a first time varying magnetic field gradient to the target c. collecting first data from the target during the step of applying the first time varying magnetic field gradient by acquiring a first data signal from the target, which is dependent in value on the values of a Fourier transform plus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform of the said characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points in a Fourier space occupied by the Fourier tranform d. determining the positions of the first data signal sample points on a first path in the Fourier space which first path is defined as a constant times the integral of the first timevarying gradient e. interpolating the value of the first data signals at a plurality of first Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space using the positions and values of the first data signal at the first data signal sample points in the Fourier space f. applying a second time varying magnetic field gradient to the target, such that second data collected from the target during application of the second time varying magnetic field gradient lie on a second path in the Fourier space, which second path starts at the end of the first path and is identical in shape and opposite in direction to the first path g. collecting the second data from the target during the step of applying the second time varying magnetic field gradient by acquiring a second data signal from the target which second data signal is dependent in value upon the values of the Fourier transform minus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform of the said characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points on the second path h. determining the positions of the second data signal sample points on the second path i. interpolating the value of the second data signals at a plurality of second Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space using the said positions and values of the second data signal at the second data signal sample points in the Fourier space j. combining the interpolated values of the first and second data signals at corresponding first and second Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space to establish combined data for each of the Cartesian grid points and k. converting the values of the said interpolated and combined data at the Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space byFourier transform to a spatial domain to produce said image data of said characteristic of the target. In an alternative aspect of the invention to the second and beforementioned aspect the invention provides a method of producing nuclear magnetic resonance image data which represents a characteristic of a target, comprising the step of a. exciting the target with a magnetic field and a radio frequency pulse b. applying a first time varying magnetic field gradient to the target c. collecting first data from the target during the step of applying the first time varying magnetic field gradient by acquiring a first data signal from the target, which is dependent in value on the values of a Fourier transform plus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform of the said characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points in a Fourier space occupied by the Fourier tranform d. determining the positions of the first data signal sample points on a first path in the Fourier space which first path is defined as a constant times the integral of the first timevarying gradient e. applying a second time varying magnetic field gradient to the target, such that second data collected from the target during application of the second time varying magnetic field gradient lie on a second path in the Fourier space, which second path starts at the end of the first path and is identical in shape and opposite in direction to the first path f. collecting the second data from the target during the step of applying the second time varying magnetic field gradient by acquiring a second data signal from the target which second data signal is dependent in value upon the values of the Fourier transform minus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform of the said characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points on the second path g. determining the positions of the second data signal sample points on the second path h. combining the values of the first and second data signals at corresponding positions along the first and second paths to establish combined data for each of the said positions i. interpolating the value of the combined data at a plurality of second Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space and j. converting the values of the interpolated and combined data at the Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space by Fourier transform to a spatial domain to produce the image data of the said characteristic of the target. For either of these latter two aspects of the invention, it is preferable that the first and second time varying magnetic field gradients applied to the target are sinusoidal. Specific gradient configurations are disclosed. A still further error correction is affected by the method of the present invention including application of third and fourth time variable magnetic fields. Finally, the steps of collecting the first and second data preferably include the substeps of a receiving first and second magnetic signals from the target with a coil and b demodulating these first and second magnetic signals with at least one product detector and at least one low pass filter to produce the first and second data signals, respectively.

In broad terms, the present invention relates to a method for producing nuclear magnetic resonance image data which represents a characteristic of a target volume, target volume 13 in Figure 1. For example, the target might be part of a patient which, for illustrative purposes, is represented by 10 in Figure 1. The first step of the subject invention requires the exciting of a target with a magnetic field and radio frequency pulse.As used herein, the term exciting includes subjecting the target to a uniform static magnetic field Bs, thereby aligning protons within the target in a single direction. This aspect of the step of exciting the target may, for example, be achieved by placing the target within electromagnetic coils. In this regard, in Fig. 1 electromagnetic coils 12 are illustrated surrounding target 13. Electromagnetic coils 12 are constructed as is well known by those skilled in the art to generate a static magnetic field Bs whose direction is along the z axis and whose magnitude is uniform over the entire volume of target 13. Field B is shown in Fig. 2 a as being uniform along the 5 central part of the z axis, and is shown in Fig. 3 a , which is time diagram, as being present during the excitation period. In fact, as shown in Fig. 3 a , Bs is present throughout the subsequent preparation and data collection steps. A suitable magnetic field power supply is required for the coils to generate Bs. In this regard, static magnetic field power supply 100 is shown in Fig. 4 coupled to coils 12. The step of exciting the target contemplated by the subject invention further includes any one of several pulse sequences, all well known to those skilled in the art. Such sequences have the common objective of causing the target, after excitation, to emit an RF signal proportional to some function characteristic of the proton spin density, the spin lattice relaxation time T1 , and the spin spin relaxation time T2 of the target. Whatever the sequence utilized, it is assumed, as is the usual practice, that at the end of the excitation process, all the nuclear spins in a particular volume slice of the target are coherently aligned perpendicular to the z axis direction of the static field Bs. For the purpose of illustrating a two dimensional implementation of the subject invention, it is further assumed that the step of excitation includes some form of slice selection.However, it should be understood that the teachings of this invention can also be applied to three dimensional implementation. One illustrative example of the step of exciting target 13, includes subjecting the target to a linear magnetic field gradient z.gz along the z axis. Magnetic field z.g is uniform for any given xy plane, but varies linearly from xy plane to xy plane as a function of z. Gradient z.gz is shown in Fig. 2 b .The time duration of gradient z.gz is shown in Fig. 3 a to exist only during the excitation period. As a result of z.gz, the magnitude of the magnetic field to which protons within the target are subjected B z.gz , varies along one axis of the target, in this case the z axis. Thus, for any small range of values of z, say z n, all protons in the xy plane at z n are subject to approximately the same magnetic field, while protons in the xy plane at z n 1 and z n 1 are subject to a smaller and larger magnetic field, respectively. This phenomenon is generally illustrated in Figure 5, wherein planar slice 16 within target 13 is defined by the application of the z.gz gradient along the z axis. The gradient may be applied to target 13 by z axis gradient coils 102, shown in Fig. 6.Coils 102 are excited by z axis gradient field driver 104, and sequence controller 106 Fig. 4 . The combined effect of Bs and z.gz produces the total z axis magnetic field B z Bs z.g, Fig. 3 a . The step of exciting further includes subjecting the target under consideration to a tailored radio frequency pulse. The term tailored, as is wsllknown to those skilled in the art, contemplates the selection of a band of frequencies corresponding to the Larmor angular frequencies wO of the protons given by the equations wO ss B z , z n, where B z is the magnitude of the z axis mag netic field, and T is the magnetogyric ratio of the protons. This tailored pulse is applied at a 900 angle to the field B z to knock corresponding protons 900 out of alignment. Referring to Figs. 4 and 7, RF coils 18 and RF transmitter 108 operate to produce this RF pulse. RF transmitter 108 may, as illustrated inFig. 4, comprise RF signal generator 110 and variable gain amplifier 112. RF switch 114 stops the relatively large output of the RF transmitter 108 from being fed directly to the senstive RF receiver 116. The RF transmitter 108, RF switch 114 and RF receiver 116 are operated under the control of sequence controller 106, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. With protons in xy planar slice 16 having a Larmor angular frequency wOa XBO n , the pulse from coils 18 is selected to correspond to wo, thereby trknocking down protons in slice 16. The tailored pulse has a duration and spectral envelope governed by controller 106 Figure 4 and exists during the excitation period as shown, for example, in Figure 3 b . A target excited by such a tailored pulse would have the tendency, if left alone, to generate a free induction decay FID magnetic signal which is capable of being received by suitable RF coils, such as coils illustrated in Figure 7. However, in this embodiment of the invention to further prepare the target under consideration, prior to any observation of a received FID signal, there is a step of applying at least one time varying magnetic field gradient to the target prior to the collection of any data from the target. The structure of the applied time varying magnetic field gradient is intimately related to the manner in which received FID data signal is converted from Fourier space to the spatial domain.As is well known, an FID signal generally is converted from Fourier space to a spatial domain to produce desired image data of a characteristic of the target. However, such prior art transforms are often unnecessarily complex or slow, or may fail to produce optimum resolution. Importantly, a target which has been exposed to a time varying magnetic field gradient, produces an FID signal which, after suitable demodulation, may be considered as a measurement of the Fourier transform of the characteristic of the target under investigation at points lying along a path in Fourier space. In fact, a direct correlation has been found between the time varying magnetic field gradient and this path through Fourier space upon which the sample points corresponding to the measured FID signal lie.The location of this path in Fourier space may be determined by simply multiplying the integral of the time varying gradient by a constant. The value of the resultant demodulated FID signal at a plurality of sample points on this path in Fourier space may be collected. The value of the data signals at these sample points inFourier space may be interpolated to a value at a plurality ofCartesian grid points superimposed over the Fourier space through relatively simple and straightforward interpolation. Once the i erpolated value of the data signals at a plurality of Cartesian grid points in Fourier space is achieved, it is a relatively simple matter using standard Fourier transform techniques to convert these plurality of Cartesian grid point values back to spatial domain to produce image data of the characteristic of the target. By determining the positions of the demodulated FID sample points in Fourier space by knowing the relationship between the time varying magnetic field and the path in Fourier space upon which these data points lie, reconstruction of image data readily follows either for two or three dimensional operation. Thus, there are three fundamentally different aspects to the embodiment of the invention excitation of z target, preparation of that target, and detection of the resultant FID signal. For explanatory purposes, the excitation period may be said to take place during the time period minus infinity to T, the preparation period from T to zero, and the detection period from zero to plus infinity, where T is a number less than zero. It is assumed then that at the end of the excitation period negative infinity toT , all the magnetic moments corresponding to the characteristic of the target which is to be measured are in phase and aligned perpendicular to the static field direction i.e., aligned perpendicular to the z axis of the target . During the detection period, the signal output E t from RF coils 18 comprises a plurality of signals gE t which each arise from a small volume of slice 16. The signals E t arising from a small volume of slice 16 and present at the output of the coils 18 may be shown to be given by 1 6E B1 xy M T e t sin t e SxSysz where Bl xy is a characteristic of the receiver coil 18 M T Xy is the magnitude of that component of the magnetic moment which lies in the x y plane and represents the characteristic function which is to be measured CO,T is the excitation period, T 0, and a value for T is given below T2 is the spin spin relaxation time constant typically 10 ms to 1000 ms for protons for the small volume element t is the angle between that component of the magnetic moment to be measured which lies in the xy plane and the x axis t denotes the time derivative of t e is a characteristic of the receiver coil 18 Sxsysz the volume of the small element of the slice which causes the signal E and x,y,z denote the usual coordinates in three dimensional space. With T2 assumed to be independent of x, thenEMI20.1 where x is a vector representing position in is a time dependent vector representing the magnetic field gradient typically in units of Tesla cm or some equivalent unit EMI20.2 Denoting B1 xy M T xy BY f x , where f is to be regarded as approximation to the desired function M T xy thenEMI20.3 and, defining F to be the Fourier transform of f, and using del to denote the usual differential operator, thenEMI20.4 assuming is independent of x.It is possible to compensate for first order spatial components of e during the preparation period and to modify equation 1 accordingly, but it remains an objective of the receiver coil design to make both e and B independent of x. Demodulation and filtering of the received FID signal E t is accomplished by RF receiver 116 of Fig. 4, in accordance with known processes. Receiver 116 may, for example, comprise amplifier 118, phase sensitive detector 120, and low pass filters 122, 124. The FID signal E t supplied from switch 114 to receiver 116, may be an RF signal in the range 1 10 MHz, modulated by the field gradients g to contain signals off set from the carrier up to 10 50 kHz. A frequency resolution of as little as 100 Hz may be required. This signal is then digitized by the analog to digital converters 126 and 128 Fig. 4 , and stored in the memory of a computer 130. A receiver 122 may therefore be used which is in a simple form, made up of a single analog input channel. This digital output from converters 126, 128 must then be processed in order to develop image data corresponding to the investigated plane 16 of target l0 Fig. 5 . For reasons discussed below, E t is preferably demodulated in phase sensitive detector 120 with a reference signal R t EMI21.1 Low pass filtering E t after such demodulation results in a demodulated signal E t EMI22.1 whereEMI22.2 The function f denotes the characteristic of the slice 16 of the target 13 which is to be measured and, by definition, F is the Fourier transform of f. The practical process of calculatingFourier transforms by means of the Fast Fourier Transform FFT is well known to those skilled in the art.Thus, if it is possible to utilize equation 3 to calculate values of F from the measurements of E then combining the use of equation 3 and theFFT will allow calculation of f from measurements of Er t . From the point of view of processing the data, the ideal relationship between Er t and F would beEMI22.3 Under these circumstances, measurements of Er t would be measurements of F and no processing to calculate values of F would be required. There are three factors in equation 3 which make this calculation complicated. They are EMI23.1 b e t T T2 1 andEMI23.2 The quantityEMI23.3 is just a constant and its presence or absence is equivalent to introducing a phase change in F and hence f , and multiplying F by .Since O is known, Y can be allowed for, and since t1 can either be estimated and the inverse phase change e applied or one can use the fact that f x is known to be real and simply remove the phase change by replacing the estimated f x by f x . The term presents more of a problem. T2 may be assumed to be sufficiently large for this term to be substantially constant over the time period of the experiment. However, a method of introducing a rough correction factor for T2 will be presented below. Removing the termEMI23.4 is more difficult and is one of the factors which motivates the definition of the gradients. A gradient function g t is chosen so that there exists tl and t2 with tl Z t2 and such that andEMI24.1 t2 2 tl With these constraints on t it follows that EMI24.2 w EMI24.3 and henceEMI24.4 Thus, given thatEMI24.5 is a constant for whose effect allowance can be made that T2 is sufficiently large that a can be considered constant and that the can be removed by placing suitable contraints on tl, t2 and , it is therefore possible to estimateEMI25.1 from the pair of readings Er t1 and Er t2 The process of slice selection during the excitation period essentially removes from consideration all points of the target outside the slice of interest and the function f will include only this slice of the target. The signal E t , then, is essentially determined by the function h whereEMI25.2 and f is zero for z outside the slice.The function h x,y is dependent only on the variables x and y.The Fourier transform of this quantity is the function F X,Y,O , and using the FFT process to make a numerical estimate of Xf dz from F X,Y,O means that F must be known at the points X Y kA for a suitable integers j and k, and sample spacing A. If the slice is to be imaged with a spatial resolution of Wc then in general it will be necessary to obtain samples of F over the region Since f is real, then, as is well known to those skilled in the art, F X where F denotes the complex conJugate of F, and it is therefore sufficient to obtain values for F over any half plane, for example Os X Wc and wc 4 Y wc. Since the data values available for F x are obtained by a combination of sampling Er t for various values of t and calculating F X , the values of F are only available at points determined by EMI26.1 This equation 4 defines a path X t through Fourier space in terms of the parameter t and data samples for Er and, hence, values of F are available at points along the path corresponding to the particular values of t for which Er t is sampled. In other words, the position of each data sample from the analog to digital converters 126 and 128 corresponds to a point on a path in Fourier space, which path is defined as a constant multiplied by the integral of the time varying magnetic gradient applied to the targetEMI26.2 For example, if T 0 and g t gy cos wgti 0 where gx, gy are constants, thenEMI26.3 is the parametric equation defining the path through Fourier space in terms of the parameter t and the non parametric form is EMI27.1 Z 0 Attention will now be given to specific preferred gradients in view of the foregoing discussion.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of present invention, assuming T g it is preferable that the magnetic field gradients t be defined as follows EMI27.2 Where denotes the x component of g t , etc..The above defines t for the preparation period T,0 and for the first observation period E01 the assignment of r is discussed below . With this definition g t is integrable on This definition is now extended to tE as follows if it is required thatEMI27.3 then one has EMI28.1 The functions S t x, g t y, EMI28.2 andEMI28.3 are illustrated in Figs. 8 a , 8 b , 8 c , and 8 d , respectively. This completes the definition of q t apart from the fact that further ,comment is required on the choice of gxt gy wg and 1 However, it is far from obvious why such a definition has been chosen, and some space is therefore devoted to examining the implications of the definition given. First of all note thatEMI28.4 hence the curve X t ,Y t , 0 in Fourier space, shown in Fig. 9 starts at the origin at t O. FurtherEMI28.5 EMI28.6 so thatEMI28.7 Now consider t ttÃ§ 2 , putting t equations 5 and 6 yield EMI29.1 EMI29.2 thus the position of X at t and t is identical, that is for point X t is moving back along its original path defining a second path through Fourier space see, Fig. 10 . Note that g has changed sign between the first and second path. Similarly when t E 2 ,,3t , putting t in equa tions 5 and 6 givesEMI29.3 giving rise to the third path in Fourier space shown in Fig. 11. For t ,4 , and t one has EMI29.4 and once again has changed sign while X is moving back along its third path to define a fourth path in Fourier space, as shown in Fig. 12. The magnetic gradients defined above may be applied to target 10 by means of x axis gradient coils 200 drawn in Fig. 13, and y axis gradient coils 202 shown in Fig. 14. Coils 200 are driven by an x gradient driver 204 Fig. 4 , which is under the control of sequence controller 106. Coils 202 are driven by a y gradient driver 206 which is also under the control of sequence controller 106. In each instance discussed above, the path through Fourier space is limited to the XY plane. If a three dimensional path is required, the z axis gradient may be altered in the same or similar manner as the y axis gradient. The First Data Collection FDC post period, Second DataCollection SDC preparatory period, Third Data Collection TDC post period, and Last Data Collection LDC preparation period of Fig. 8 allow time for g t to change smoothly i.e. without discontinuities from the value required for the previous data collection period to the value required for the next data collection period. The constant t is chosen so that q t 0 at term thus y 4 4n 1 t 2w g or lr 4n 3 t 2w g for some positive integer n. The first option is chosen because this makes the FDC period CO, T t 2w a complete number of g cycles of the path x t . This later condition ensures that g t y is continuous in fact g t y gy cos w t for g Similarly the rather obscure definition of g t x for ensures that this component has no discontinuities.This is done because it is not only impossible but also undesirable for g t to change too fast. This same fact provides the motivation for the definition of a on T,O . The remaining constants gx, gy, w and n are chosen in ac g cordance with the standard practices of sampling theory. The point X 2n w , which is the end of the FDC period, must be g chosen so that the X interval O,Wc is covered thus X 2n w J 2n . wc. g w gSimilarly, the amplitude of the path, g 1w , must be chosen so that the Y intveral wc, wc is adequately covered, thus Sy, wc. w gThe gradient magnitudes gx must be chosen so that the effect of inhomogeneity in the static field is reduced to acceptable levels and Wg and the data sampling rate of the analog to digital converter must be chosen so that an adequate number of samples are collected for the interpolation and subsequent FFT given the slice dimensions and the spatial resolution required.Given the desired pathEMI31.1 for two in Fourier spacewthe values of t for t O are now determined. The values of g for ts O are then determined by the continuity requirement 0 g 0 and by the requirement that gradient manipulation in the interval T,0 should not affect the pathX t for two thus givingEMI32.1 Summarizing, the method includes the steps of exciting a target with a magnetic field.This step of exciting is illustratively shown by Figs. 1, 2 a , 2 b , and 3 b as subjecting a target to a static field which includes a static uniform component B and static gradient along the z axis, S g t 0, 0, gz . The step of exciting extends during an excitation period after which the z gradient is removed. During this excitation period as illustratively shown in Fig. 3 b a tailored pulse is applied to excite protons within a selected xy planar slice, for example, slice 16 of Fig. 5. The method of the subject invention further includes the step of applying at least a first varying magnetic field gradient to the target. Illustrative of this step, a time varying magnetic field gradient g t as shown in Fig. 8 may be applied to target 13 of Fig. 1. In Fig. 8, a first time variable magnetic field gradient t is shown to occur during the first data collection period whereas a second time varying magnetic field gradient is shown to apply during the second data collection period of Fig. 8. A third time variable magnetic field gradient is illustratively shown in Fig. 8 during a third data collection period and a fourth time variable magnetic field gradient is also disclosed in Fig. 8 for a last data collection period. The method of the present invention includes the further step of collecting first data from the target during the step of applying the first time varying magnetic field gradient by acquiring a first data signal from the target which first data signal is dependent in value on the values of a Fourier transform plus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform of the characteristic of the target at a plurality of sample points inFourier space occupied by that Fourier transform. Preferably, the step of collecting this first data includes the sub steps of receiving a first magnetic signal from a target with a coil and then demodulating that first resultant signal with at least one product detector to produce the first data signals. As illustratively shown in Fig. 5, coils 18 are used during the first data collection period of Fig. 8 to receive a magnetic signal E t from target 13. Signal E t is demodulated with a phase sensitive detector 120 and passed through low pass filters 122 and 124 to produce first data signals having a real part from low pass filter 122 and an imaginary part from low pass filter 124 .This first data signals are sampled by analog to digital convertors 126 and 128, and stored in memory of computer 130 seeFigs. 15 and 16 . During the second data collection period of Fig 8, E t is demodulated and passed through low pass filters 122, 124 for the second data collection period, and the resultant digital samples from convertors 126, 128 are also stored in a second data area 130 b of the memory of computer 130. In a similar manner, digital samples of Er t for the third data collection period of Figure 8 are sampled and stored in a third data area 130 c of memory and digital samples of Er t during the last data collection period of Figure 8 are sampled and stored in a fourth data area 130 d of memory. The sample signals Er t stored in data memory areas 130a through 130d are dependent on the values of a Fourier transform of the characteristic under investigation of target 10, namely some function of the spin density distribution at the time constants T1 and T2 within planar slice 16 of target 13. This relationship may be seen by equation 3 set forth above.However, equation 3 indicates that Er t , namely the demodulated and filtered E t signal, includes a, relationship which is dependent not only the Fourier transform, BsF 31g , g ,but also on the spatial derivative of that Fourier transform namely the term of equation 3 includingEMI34.1 Furthermore, the subject method includes the step of determining the positions of the first data signal sample points on a first path in Fourier space, which first path is defined as a constant times the integral of the first time varying gradient.As applied to the illustrative preferred embodiment disclosed herein, the sample points of Er t from the output of analog to digital convertors 126, 128 which act as a digital sampler lie on a path defined in Fourier space as a constant times the integral of the timevarying gradient t , sinceEMI35.1 Therefore, by taking the integral of the magnetic field gradient as a function of time, one can determine the precise location in Fourier space of each sample point E t . In this regard, attention is directed toFig. 17 which discloses the XY coordinates of a plane in Fourier space. Path 50 winds its way through the Fourier space defined by plane XY. Path 50 has indicated on it a plurality of sample point 52.The value of path 50 at each sample points 52 can be determined by first determining at what point in time path 50 pass through a particular sample point 52. This can be determined by the relationshipEMI35.2 since g is known. Thus, once having determined the position of a particular sample point 52 in Fourier space, say for example sample point 52a, the value Er t may be readily determined by accessing that value of Er t from the first data area of computer 130 Fig. 4 for that point in time.In a similar manner the value of path 50 throughFourier space at sample point 52b, 52c and 52d can also be determined by simply accessing the corresponding Er t values stored in first data area using the relationshipEMI35.3 In a similar manner the value of Er t for the second, third and last data collection periods can be located on second, third and fourth paths through Fourier space illustrated in Figs. 10, 11 and 12, respectively. The method disclosed herein further includes the step of interpolating the value of the first data signals as a plurality of first Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space using the positions and values of the first data signal at the first data signal sample points in the Fourier space. A plurality of representative Cartesian grid points 54 are shown in Figure 17. It is preferable to interpolate the value of Er t for each of grid points 54. Although there are a number of sophisticated known processes by which such interpolation may be accomplished, one of the simplest of such methods includes the steps of selecting four sample points nearest the particular Cartesian grid point under consideration. For example, if Cartesian grid point 54a of Figure 17 was under consideration, sample points 52a, b, c and d would be selected. The step of interpolation next requires selecting the two of the sample points 52a, b, c and d which have an X value less than the X value of the chosen Cartesian grid point 54a. For the example of Figure 17, these two sample points are 52a and 52b.Next, the value of Er t at sample points 52a and 52b are averaged to determine a corresponding value for the point 56 having the same Y coordinate as the Cartesian grid point 54a and lying on the straight line joining 52 a and 52 b . Calling this average value s1, sl may be determined by s1 Er52b t Er52a t Er52b t r2 r1 r2 , where Er52a t equalsthe value of Er t at sample point 52a, ErS2b t equals the value of Er t at sample point 52b, r1 equals the distance from the Y axis coordinate of Cartesian grid point 54a to the Y axis coordinate of the sample point 52a and r2 equals the distance from the Y axis coordinate ofCartesian grid point 54a and the Y axis coordinate of the sample point 52b. A similar process is used to determine an average value of ofthe point 58 from Er t at sample points 52c and 52d.Finally, using a similar methodology, the interpolated value of Er t for Cartesian grid point 54a is determined using the calculated values s1 and s2 and the respective distances between the points 56, 54a and 58. A similar methodology may be employed to calculate the value of Er t for each Cartesian grid point 54 in the XY Fourier space plane of Figure 17. Additionally the step of converting the value of each data signal at the Cartesian grid points in Fourier space by Fourier transformation to a spatial domain to produce image data of the investigated characteristic of the target, is carried out. As applied to the interpolated values Er t at Cartesian grid points 54 of Figure 17, any of many well known two dimensional discrete Fourier transformations may be employed. This is true, , since the interpolated values are now located on a Cartesian coordinates system in Fourier space. For example, a Fourier transformation may be employed as set forth in A. Oppenheim R.Schafer, Digital Signal Processing Âµ 3.9, at 115 21 PrenticeHall, Inc. 1975 . This material is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Of course, more sophisticated two dimensional discrete Fourier transformation methods may be employed consistent with the spirit of the subject invention. As noted above, Er t , although dependent upon the values of a Fourier transform in Fourier space, are in fact dependent upon these values plus the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform note equation 3 . However, a simple combination of Er t for the first data collection period of Fig. 8 and for the second data collection period of Fig. 8 provides a correction eliminating these spatial derivatives. Specifically EMI38.1 and from equations 5 and 6 ,EMI38.2 thusEMI38.3 henceEMI39.1 provided 2 t T2 0 4 tl 4 where tl first data collection period, and t2 is the second data collection period. From this, one may proceed to the estimation of F. This process is shown in Fig. 15, where the real and imaginary parts of Er t for each data sample point stored in the first data memory area 130 a is added to the corresponding data sample point stored in the second data memory area 130 b . This addition results in a correction which eliminates the spatial derivatives of Er t The resultant sums are then each scaled by the factor e .Afterscaling,the data points are interpolated and then Fast Fourier Transformed to produce image data suitable for display. With this process, there still remains, however, an attenua tion effect due to the assumption that 2t VCT2. From equations 5 and 6 it can be shown that EMI40.1 Using these and the facts that EMI40.2 then it may be shown that EMI40.3 from which a value of T2 may be estimated for each tl e CO, rI. Given T21 an approximate correction can be made to the values ofEr t to allow for T2 decay. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 16, the data sample point values Er ti are multipled by corresponding values Er t2 and then divided by the product Er t3 Er t4 for corresponding data sample points. T2 is calculated using equation 7 , and then used to correct the value of each data sample point in the first, second, third and fourth data memory areas 130 a , 130 b , 130 c , 130 d . The corrected data sample point values for the first and second data memory areas are then used as described above with respect to Fig. 15 to produce image display data.The resultant image data not only has a correction to eliminate the negative effects of the spatial derivative of the Fourier transform in Er t but also has a correction to reduce the negative effect of the underlying assumption that T2 is very much greater than the time during which data collection occurs.Further it is also possible to obtain a record estimate of F by calculating the quantity Er t3 E t4 from the third and fourth memories 130 c and 130 d . These two estimates of F could then be combined to further improve the accuracy of F if this was felt desirable. Data collected during the first, second, third and fourth data collection periods may, of course, be combined either before or after interpolation to Cartesian grid points. The above described embodiment of the present invention describes how image data may be obtained directly from a twodimensional planar slice 16 of a target 13. It should be understood that the principles of the subject invention are also applicable to three dimensional imaging. For example, multiple slices 16 may be taken in succession through target 13 using the techniques described above. In the alternative, slice 16 may be chosen to have depth either by minimizing the graduation of z gradient zg , or by widening the frequency spectrum of the tai bred pulse applied by RF transmitter 108. Once a slice 16 of significant height is employed, then during data collection the amplitudes of the x, y, and z gradients may be varied to define a three dimensional path through Fourier space. The location of the resultants sample points of the signal Er t may be determined using the integal of the three dimensionally varying magnetic gradients, to interpolate those values Er t to threedimensional Cartesian grid points in the Fourier space. Threedimensional discrete Fourier transform technology may then be used to convert the interpolated Er t values to the spatial domain. It is also possible to achieve three dimensional imaging by using the subject methodology to achieve imaging of a two dimensional projections and then using standard back projection reconstruction methodology to extend into three dimensional space.
