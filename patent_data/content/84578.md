According to US PS 4,043,980 Mo 1609 US halogenated thiobisphenol copolycarbonates are known, the molecular weights thereof Mw are between 10,000 and 200,000. The subject of instant invention are thiobisphenolcopolycarbonates having weight average molecular weights Mw between 18,000 and 22,000 and thiobisphenoxycarbonate units in amounts between 15 mole to 35 mole , preferably between 20 mole to 30 mole , referred to the total molar amount of bisphenoxy carbonate units, characterized in that they consist of thiobisphenoxycarbonate units of the following formula I EMI3.1 wherein X is H or C1 C4 alkyl and a is a number of zero to 2, and other diphenoxy carbonate units of the following formula II , EMI4.1 wherein X and a have the same meaning as in formula I and Z is a C1 C5 alkylene, C2 C5 alkylidene, cyclohexylene, cyclohexylidene.

The copolycarbonates of the instant invention are terminated as usual by phenoxy radicals derived from phenol or alkyl substituted or halogen substituted phenols, as known in prior art. The amount of monofunctional chain stopper used depends on the molecular weight of the copolycarbonate to be achieved. Between 3 mole and 5 mole , referred to the amount of diphenoxy carbonate units present in the molecule are chosen. The copolycarbonates can be prepared according to the well known interfacial polycondensation process using phosgene, mixture of aqueous alkaline phase and organic phase consisting of aliphatic hydrocarbons and or aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic tertiary amines as catalysts, reaction temperatures between 150C and 350C, reaction times between 15 and 45 min. and pHvalues between 11,5 and 13.5. The mole ratio of phosgene to dihydroxymonomer is between 1,1 1,2 1 phosgene dihydroxymonomer. The aqueous alkaline phase consists e.g. of an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the organic phase consists e.g. of CH2Cl2 and or chlorobenzene, and the aliphatic tertiary amine consists of triethylamine orN ethyl piperidine. The two phase boundary process is generally described in detail e.g. in Schnell, Chemistry andPhysics of polycarbonates, 1964, Interscience Publishers,New York , or e.g. in US Patent 3,028,365.

The copolycarbonates of the instant invention can be obtained from the two phase reaction medium in known manner by separating the phases, neutralizing, washing etc. and finally evaporating the organic solvent or precipitating the solid polycarbonate from the organic dried solution. The copolycarbonates of instant invention have a combination of good properties like easy processability and excellent mechnical physical properties. Because of the inherent high viscosity of commercial polycarbonates their processing, i.e., molding, is carried out at temperatures higher than 6000F 3160C.Molds having complicated pattern or ones having thin cavities present particular difficulties because the resin often stops its flow before completely filling the mold and the operator electing to overcome this problem by raising the process temperature runs the risk of thermally degrading the resin. The present invention offers an attractive solution in that the desirable properties of high molecular weight polycarbonates are made available in the form of a low molecular weight resin. which is moldable at less than 500 F 260 C and preferably lower than 4850F 2510C.Thin, 20 mils. 0.5 mm, and as low as 5 mils 0,13 mm or less, and complicated parts can now be molded at sufficiently low temperatures thus avoiding the risk of thermal degradation. The result of instant invention is contrary to the teaching of GB PS 1,368X338 Le A 13 673 GB wherein good flow properties of low molecular weight polycarbo nates can only be obtained. via branching. The polycarbonates of the invention can be fqrmed into shaped articles, test. specimen, films etc. There can be added stabilizing and fillers.
