# Multiple hydrocyclone device.

## Abstract
A multiple hydrocyclone device 14 wherein cyclone units 28 are integrally formed in radial relationship in units 28 are integrally formed in radial relationship in pre molded separable discs 27 which are mounted in stacked concentric and internested relationship one upon the other within a common housing 15 . The hub portions 37 of discs 27 provide a central chamber 30 to receive the underflow fraction from the cyclones with the overflow dis charged from openings in the periphery 38 of discs 27 to an outer chamber 34 . Sealing rings 54 are arranged between the internested discs to maintain leak proof inte grity of the stacked discs 27 with spring 80 urgent thrust plate means 73 disposed at the to of the stack to permit movement or expansion of the discs in operation of the device without disturbing the sealed relationship.
