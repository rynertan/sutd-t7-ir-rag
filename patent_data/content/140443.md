## Description
Title an apparatus for automatically watering plants. The present invention relates to an apparatus for automatically watering plants arranged on a substrate, which apparatus comprises a liquid supply conduit fitted with a valve operated by a control device controlled by feeler members arranged in a measuring portion of the apparatus.Such an apparatus, coacting with a few plants only, controls the liquid supply to a very large number of adjacently disposed plants. In prior art apparatus, e.g. a greenhouse for plants of conventional dimensions is divided as regards the moisture supply e.g. into four parts, each being provided with a control device of the above mentioned type. When the control device is arranged in a location where the fluid consumption is expected to be the highest, it is ensured that all plants in this part of the greenhouse are sufficiently watered. The above described apparatus is described e.g. in Dutch patent application 77.04535. Since excess fluid cannot be re used, in connection with the conveyance of disease germs, if any, this has to be discharged. Since a great many plants can be watered by means of the aforementioned measuring device, it is important to effect this overdose in an accurate manner. It is, in fact, not possible to accurately establish the quantity of fluid consumed by means of the apparatus disclosed in the above Dutch patent application this is to take place experimentally. Consequently, it is more difficult still to give thecorrect overdose, with the result that too much or too little fluid is supplied to the plant. It is an object of the present invention to remove these drawbacks. To this effect, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the substrate of the measuring device is arranged in a box connected to a subjacent trough by means of a constriction, while between the substrate and the bottom of the trough there is provided a capillary matting, a downwardly extending portion of which extends through said constriction into the trough, the latter being connected directly to the measuring portion into which the feeler members of the control device extend, the feeler member for indication of the maximum liquid position extending to the level of the constriction. The measuring portion may be provided with an overflow opening, so that the excess is discharged adjacent the measuring device. Since the other plants in the greenhouse are arranged, in known manner, on a substrate portion enveloped by a plastics foil, the discharge of redundant liquid can be effected by making an incision or like opening in the plastics foil at the required location. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the feeler member indicating the desired maximum liquid position may extend to adjacent the overflow opening, so that even the plants present adjacent the measuring device are provided with an accurate quantity of moisture. The apparatus according to the present invention allows to determine the desired overdose in an easy manner the desired minimum and maximum position for the measuring device can be set, without more ado in light of experience.By measuring the filling time needed for filling the measuring portion from the minimum to the maximum position, the additional filling time and hence the overdosage can also be easily set. Since the feeler member extends to adjacent the constriction for indicating the maximum liquid position, a highly accurate setting can be obtained, which is of great importance, considering the total surface area to be wetted. It is stressed that the present invention concerns a system wherein a substrate misused and not a hydro or water cultivation system, as disclosed e.g. in German Offenlegungsschrift 2,813,410 and European patent application 82,697. Furthermore, British patent 1,501,374 discloses a system wherein pot plants are arranged on a capillary matting, a depending edge of which extends into a trough to be provided with fluid. There is nb question here of any control. This also applies to the substrate system described in US patent 4,299,056, wherein a substrate packaged in a capillary matting is described and in which a depending part of the capillary material is present in a liquid filled trough. There is no question of any control, however. One embodiment of the apparatus for wetting plants according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a part cross sectional side view of an apparatus for controlling the watering of plants Fig. 2 is a side view of the apparatus shown inFig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a cross section on the line III III ofFig. 1. As shown in the drawings, an apparatus for watering plants comprises a frame 9 receiving a stainless steel box 1 fitted on the underside with a water supply trough 2 extending along the length of the box. The supply trough 2 is connected to the box 1 by means of a constriction 3. On the bottom of the box there is provided a cotton matting 4, which is enveloped at least partly by a foil, not shown. The matting has a downwardly extending portion 5, which extends via the constriction 3 to the bottom of the trough 2. The trough 2 connects to the measuring portion 6, fitted with an overflow opening 7. Underneath the opening, there is provided a drip edge 8 on the outer side of the measuring portion. To the frame 9, there is also attached a control device 10, which is fitted with three feeler members 11, 12 and 13. Such a control device with feeler members is known per se from Dutch patent application 70.06427 and the afore cited Dutch patent application 77.04535. The feeler member 11 extends to adjacent the lower edge of che overflow opening 7 and indicates a maximum fluid position, while the feeler member 12 extends to the level of the trough 2 and indicates a minimum position. The electrode 13 finally extends to underneath the trough, and indicates an alarm position. In the box 1 there is provided on the cotton matting 4 a mineral wool matting 14, also called substrate, enveloped by a foil, not shown, which is fitted at the top with an opening for placing thereon a plant pot 15 with plant 16 whose roots, in time, extend to adjacent the underside of the substrate. The plant 16 can be watered via a diagrammatically shown liquid supply conduit 17 incorporating a valve, not shown, operated by the control device 10. The operation of the apparatus is as follows As soon as the liquid level in the measuring portion falls to underneath the electrode 12, liquid is supplied through the conduit 17. As soon as the liquid level again touches the electrode 11, the desired overdosage commences and the excess is discharged via the opening 7. The apparatus offers the possibility of accurately measuring the quantity of water employed, so that also the desired quantity of overdosage can be established in En accurate manner. A consequence is that the loss of liquid, which may or may not contain nutrients, is minin ized. Another possibility of accurately measuring the quantity of fluid used is that the pot with plants is weighed continuously and is watered under the control of a computer. Naturally, it is also possible to apply further variants within the scope of the inventive idea. For instance, each plant or group of plants may be arranged in a box 4, or, as in the embodiment shown, a plant may be disposed in the box 4 and the other plants of the group on separate substrate mattings situated directly on the bottom.
