Preferred salts are those with alkyl metals, such as sodium and potassium, with earth alkaly metals such as magnesium and calcium, with organic bases, such as diethanolamine, tromethamine or with amphoteric products such as lysine or arginine.According to another feature, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I and, possibly, of their salts with inorganic or organic bases, characterized in that a bromopyrrolidin9sne derivative of formulaII EMI1.2 wherein R1 has the above definite meaning, is treated with a thiolic compound of formula III HS R III wherein R has the above definite meaning, or with an alkali salt thereof, possibly in the presence of an inorganic or organic base in an organic solvent at a temperature of between 0tC 400C and the thus obtained product is then possibly converted into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.The starting compounds of formula II are known in the literature and may be prepared by reacting 2,4 dibromobutiryl bromide with glycine ethylester and subsequent cyclization of the N 2,4 dibronobutiryl glycine ethylester with sodium methoxide with methanol II Pharmaco, Ed. sci. 1978, 33, 130 141 .
