Information display system. The invention relates to an information deisplay system. The invention intends to provide a system which is particularly suitable for displaying video information on large screens. For this purpose the invention provides a system of the kind set forth in the preamble which is characterized in that it comprises a computer device having at least one input member for receiving video information and a processor member connected to the input member for processing and or controlling digital video information contained in and or obtained from the video information received from the input member and or digital video information produced by the computer device itself in order to produce display data and control signals, a communication channel having a data bus connected to the processor member of the computer device and a control bus for the transmission of the display data and the control signals respectively, a memory device connected to the data bus for storing display data received from the data bus, a memory control device connected to the control bus for controlling the storage of display data in and reading the stored display data from the memory device in response to the control signals received from the control bus, a digital analogue conversion device connected to the memory device for producing analogue display signals during reading of the memory device and at least one display panel consisting of a plurality of electronic display units arranged side by side in a manner such that the respective display locations together constitute the display surface of the display panel. The display surface of the display panel may vary between, 2 example, 2 for example, 2 ms and 200 ms or more, whilst the depth of the dis play panel remains the same, for example, 50 cms, independently of the size. Preferably the display panel is formed by arranging a plurality of display tubes side by side in a frame. The system embodying the present invention might be designated a super macro image television. By means of the system embodying the present invention television programmes, video programmes and or information programmes can be displayed on a large screen. Video programmes may be received from a video pbk up or a video camera. Thanks to the computer device texts, logos and amination images can be written on the display surface of the display panel.The information may be included both separately and simultaneously in the current television or video programme. Moreover, the information can be directly written by a keyboard on the display surface or directly by means of pre programmed video cassettes. The above summary is not limitative. Briefly stated, an image can be displayed on a large scale, whilst a plurality of images can be combined into one large image to be displayed. The display panel has a very high resolution and a high luminance exceeding many times that of a normal television image. This means that the display panel can be used also in daylight. In order to protect the display surface of the display panel it may be provided at the front with a transparent perspex sheet. The system embodying the invention is particularly suitable for advertising, video performances, information transmission, film display or combinations of these possibilities. Finally it is an aiantage of the system embodying the present invention that displays can be true to time and various effects can be obtained such as repetitions, slow down representations, close ups and so on. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a highly simplified block diagram of the system embodying the invention, Fig. 2 is a front view of the panel of the system embodying the present invention, Fig. 3 shows a block diagram in further detail of the system embodying the present invention, which is in particular compatible with the known television system and the display panel is composed of display tubes, Fig. 4 shows a detail of a display tube of the panel embodying the invention and Fig. 5A, B, C illustrate the use of prisms in the display panel in accordance with the invention. Fig. 1 Shows a highly simplified block diagram of the information display system in accordance with the invention. Reference numeral 1 designates a computer device having a video input 101 and being connected to a data bus 102, a control bus 103 and an address bus 104. The computer device may furthermore be connected to marginal apparatus 6, for example, a terminal station and a memory for video information to be displayed produced by the computer device. The digital video information produced by the computer device may or may not be displayed together with the received video information processed or not processed and being of digital, analogous nature or a combination thereof on a display panel.For this purpose the system embodying the invention comprises at least one display panel 5, a memory device 2, a memory control device 3 and a digital analogue conversion device 4.The digital display data of the computer device are transmitted through the data bus to the memory device, whereas the address and control signals of the computer are transmitted by means of the address bus and the control bus respectively to the memory control device 3. The memory control device generates control dignals on a line 103 to control the memory device 2 and control signals on a line 103 to control the digital analogue converter, which receives display data signals through a line 102 . Finally the digital analogue converter 4 passes analogue display signals through a line 107 to the display panel 5. As stated above, the video information received by the computer device may be of a digital or analogue nature or a combination thereof. In this regard the video input of the computer may be connected to a member capable of detecting the nature of the incoming video information and or to an analogue digital converter for converting incoming analogue video information into digital video information. Moreover, the computer may have separate inputs for analogue and for digital video information. The memory control device 3, the memory device 2 and the digital analogue conversion device 4 may each be formed by a plurality of the respective members co operating with different display panels 5. According to the invention each display panel 5 consists of a plurality of electronic display units 52 Fig. 2 each having a reproducing surface 53. The electronic display units are arranged side by side in the frame 5t of the display panel in a manner such that the respective display surface 53 together constitute the display surface of the display panel, the latter surface being marked by a dotand dash outline designated by reference numeral 56. The display surface of the display panel may be flat or curved, for example, corresponding with the curvatures of the display tubes employed. Since the display panel 1 is composed of identical units, replacement can be carried out in a simple manner. With respect to each display panel 5 the memory device 2, the memory control device 3 and the digital analogue converter 4 comprise at least one individual member for each electronic display unit of the display panel. Widen the incoming video information is at least compatible with the interlaced colour television system, each memory device and memory control device may comprise for each electronic display member two respective members and the digital analogue converter may comprise for each colour two respective members, i.e.in the case of colour signals, six digital analogue converting members.The system embodying the invention may, of course also be designed for the sole reproduction of black white video information, whilst the system may furthermore be designed for multiple interlacing. One of the most important faculties of the system embodying the invention is that the computer device 1 processes video information received at the input 101 in a manner such that this information, which is reproducible with the aid of a single electronic display unit 52 can now be displayed on a display panel 5 of considerably larger dimensions by partial images contained in said video information to be displayed on one individual electronic display unit of the display panel in a manner such that by allotting partial images to defined electronic display units the same image is formed, but of muoh larger dimensions and improved resolution.The display panel may even be composed of 400 display screens or television display tubes, each of which is capable of displaying a partial image lt400th the original image, electronically magnified to the dimensions of the original image size. The system embodying the present invention might, therefore, be termed an image magnifying system. Owing to the digital processing the resolution is, however, not adversely affected in contrast to the effect of optical means. A further possibility of the system embodying the invention resides in using a number of electronic display units of continuous display surfaces for reproducing an original image on an enlarged scale and using remaining electronic display members for reproducing additional video information generated by the computer itself and or introduced with the aid of a terminal station and a memory. It will be obvious that the system embodying the invention encompasses numerous possibilities of use in many domains. Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of Fig. 1 more in detail for the case in which the received video information consists of analogue colour signals and a synchronizing signal and in which furthermore the interlacing system is employed. Referring to Fig. 3 the computer device comprises a processor member 10, a multiplexer 11, an analogue digital converting member 12, a data coupling member 13, a clock generator 14, control members 15 and 16 and an amplifier 17. The computer device is furthermore connected to marginal apparatus such as a terminal station 61 and a memory 62. Of the memory and the memory control device is shown only that part which co operates with one electronic display unit, in particular, comprising a colour display tube 57 and a television board 50. In view of the interlacing system the memory, the memory control and the digital analogue converter are doubled for each electronic display unit. For the sake of ease only one part indicated by a dotand dash outline designated by reference symbol I will be described hereinafter. Referring to Fig. 3 there are provided a memory member, a memory control member and three digital analogue converting members for each raster of a half image to be displayed on the display tube of each electronic display unit. The memory member, the memory control member and the digital analogue converting member may, however, be designed so that in common for the rasters of an image to be displayed on the display tube of each electronic display unit there are provided only one memory member, one memory control member and three analogue digital converting members, the memory member having double the capacity of the memory members of Fig. 3 in case of duplicate interlacing.The respective memory control members control the memory members in a manner such that when one half of a memory member is read and displayed synchronously herewith on the respective display tube, the other half of the memory is written or supplemented. In case of the double structure of Fig. 3 the electronic implementation is simpler than in the other case mentioned above as a result of the less complex control requirements. In case of said double structure it is preferred for each electronic display unit to comprise a display tube or a different screen member and three insertable printed circuits, one print having the required electronic means for generating at least one electron beam in the case of a display tube, for sucking off the electron beam s and for controlling the instantaneous intensity thereof and a second print and, preferably, a third print identical to the second print having each a memory member, a memory control member and a number of digital analogue converting members equal to the number of electronic beams. The display panel is composed in this case of identical units. The interlacing part 1 is connected by means of a communication channel 10 to the computer device. The communication channel 100 comprises the above mentioned data bin 102, the control bus 103 and the address bus 104 and apart therefrom a clock bus 105 and a synchronisation bus 106. The communication channel may comprise cables, infrared or fibre optical ways. The clock generator 14 produces a clock signal and applies the same to the multiplexer 11, the analogue digital converting member 12, the processor member 10, the data coupling member 13 and by means of the amplifier 17 to the clock bus. The clock generator 14 produces sampling pulses of a frequency as high as is required for display with a large bandwidth input. The incoming video information includes the colour video signals red, green and blue, which are applied to the multiplexer 11 and a synchronizing signal applied to the processor member 10, the data coupling member 13 and the synchronizing bus 106. The colour video signals multiplexed by the multiplexer 11 are digitalized in the analogue digital converter 12 and then applied to the data coupling member and subsequently to the processor member in order to process the data concerned in accordance with a programme or instructions furnished by the terminal station 61 and or the memory 62. This processing can be concerned with a processing of the incoming video information, but also with the combination thereof with internally generated video information. By means of control members 16 the data coupling member 13 provides display data to the data bus 102. It is not necessary to provide invariably one driving member for each electronic display unit. In a specific case, for example, one driving member may be used for three electronic display units. The same applies to the driving members 15, which pass the address and control signals of the processor member to the control bus. Finally the processor member applies furthermore a control signal to the data coupling member. Each memory control member 31 is connected to the address bus 104, the control bus 103, the clock bus 105 and the synchronisation bus 106. Each memory member 21 is connected to the data bus and receives through the line 104 address signals and through the line 103 control signals from the memory control member 31 concerned. The digital analogue converting members 41, 42 and 43 for red, green and blue respectively receive through the line 103 a fly back suppression signal from the memory control member 31 and through the lines 102R, 102G and 102 B respectively the respective display data and in turn they apply through the lines 107R, 107G and 107B analogue display signals to the television board 50, which board is also connected to the synchronization bus, which means that all display screens 57 are synchronously scanned or written. A memory control member 31 is selected by an address and each memory member 21 receives instructions by means of the data and control bus. The further data address signals are video information.The data are stored in the memory in accordance with the address. Reading of the memory members issynchronized by the synchronizing signal contained in the incoming video information. The control is furthermore such that reading synchronous with the scan of the first interlacing part I supplements the second interlacing part II. Visual improvement is obtained by writing the second interlacing on the edges of the image dots of the first interlacing. The system embodying the invention comprises at least one display device having a large screen controlled by a computer device.The object of the system according to the present invention is to display video information and information processed and controlled by a computer device on large surfaces In synchronism with the image display sound may, of course, be reproduced. Recurring to the display panel 5 as shown by way of example in Fig. 2 it is assumed that the electronic display members comprise cathode ray tubes or display tubes 42. The following part of this description is in particular concerned with the perfection of the visual impression, that is to say, the impression that the display panel 5 functions as a single screen, whilst the display surface is formed by the respective discrete surfaces 53 of the display tubes 52. This involves that 9 solution has to be found for the discontinuities 54 and 55 resulting from the side by side arrangement of the display tubes 52. These discontinuities can be minimized by disposing the display tubes 52 as near one another as possible.For that matter, the discontinuities in smaller panels will be more disturbing than in large panels, since the viewing distance from the panel is larger in the latter case. A further problem of the display panel in the system embodying the invention may reside in that, as is known, the front faces of the display tubes are curved. This problem is particularly involved when the display tubes are mounted, so to say, in a flat plane. A solution for the two above mentioned problems is found in the use of flat, transparent Fresnel lenses preferably having having more than 60 grooves cm. In front of the front side of each display tube 52 is disposed a Fresnel lens in a manner such that the image displayed by the respective display tube is magnified to an extent such that the respective images of partial images join one another and are transformed in a flat plane determined by the Fresnel lenses In practice it has been found that this solution is particularly suitable for small display panels. A solution for the problem of obtaining co planar images displayed by the various display tubes 52 is particularly related to the display tubes themselves. Fig. 4 shows a detail of a display tube to be used in the panel in accordance with the invention. With the exception of the front side of the display tube it is a conventional one. The centre line of the display tube is designated by M and the screen is designa ted by reference numeral 61. The screen 61 is a curved surface having phosphor trios in the case of colour display tubes. The front side of the display tube designated by reference numeral 62 is flat and adjoins the curved outer face of the screen 61. In the front plate are included optical fibres i.e. at least one fibre per colour phosphor trio in a manner such that at the centre the fibre or fibres is are at right angles to both the screen 61 and the front face 62, whereas towards the outside the fibres spread in fan like fashion as is clearly shown in Fig. 4. The fibres themselves are designated by reference numeral 64.Briefly stated, the fibres 64 transform the curved surface of the screen 61 into a flat surface 62. Owing to the flat structure of the front plates of the display tubes they can be arranged more closely to one another, whilst the remaining interstice, at least at the level of the front plate, can be filled out with an elastic filler, for example, silicone cement. The advantage of using at least partly transparent silicone cement is that the silicone cement will absorb to some extent the radiation of the front plates between which it is sandwiched so that the aforesaid discontinuities are at least less conspicuous and under favourable conditions they will not attract the attention. A further solution of the problem involved in the discontinuities is found in the use of prisms specifically d S igned for this purpose as shown in Figs. 5A, B, C. Referring to Figs. 5A, C reference numeral 70 designates the screen of a conventional display tube having a curved front plate 71.In the side by side arrangement of the display tubes 70 gaps 72 are formed, which give rise to the aforesaid discontinuities. At the periphery of the front plate 71 of the display tube 70 are placed prisms 73, 73 so that the prisms arranged on neighbouring display tubes co operate with one another as is indicated in Figs. 5A, C. Fig. 5B shows an optically transparent bar 74 or light guide, which has reflective layers on the long sides, for example a metal foil 75. The bars are disposed in re entrant positions one on the other. The effect of the prisms is based on the principle of light conduction by reflection at the walls. The bars 74 are thus arranged at an angle to the front plate 71 of the display tube 70. In other words, the effect of the prisms is based on total reflection in a parallel transparent body. In fact filling out the discontinuities in the display is not based 6n information transmission but on the transmission of colour and luminance or else the colour and light dark effect on the screen. The continuity is thus essentially obtained as a confused image. Furthermore, the cross sectional areas of the bars 74 may be related to the size of the image dot. Fig. 5C illustrates the use of conical light conductors 74 in the prisms 73 . The light conductors are arranged in contact with one another and adjoin the front plate of the display tube and are in line with one another on the other side of the prism in a manner such that they are directed in positions arrow B opposite to the curvature arrow A of the front plate of the display tube.
