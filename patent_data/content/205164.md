# Semiconductor device structure.

## Abstract
This invention is a semiconductor device e.g. 10 com prising at least one semiconductor element which comprises a first epitaxial region e.g. 13 comprising InP or III V semi conductor compound approximately lattice matched to InP, a gate electrode e.g. 19 , and a second epitaxial region e.g. 14 and 15 contacting both the first epitaxial region and the gate electrode. The improvement resides in the use of the second epitaxial region consisting essentially of gallium arsenide with thicknesses greater than 70 nm. The invention is espe cially suitable for use in field effect transistors. Useful field effect transistors can be made with gallium indium arsenide as the electron conducting layer channel layer by incorporating a layer of gallium arsenide for the Schottky barrier. Relatively thick gallium arsenide layers e.g. greater than 70 nm. are used to achieve low reverse leakage currents.
