# Multi mode exercising apparatus.

## Abstract
A multi mode exercising apparatus, which includes an exercising member 14 , a rotary actuator 65 coupled to the exercising member 14 controlling its movement in response to fluid flow therethrough and a servo valve means 78 coupled to the actuator 65 for controlling both the direction and rate of fluid flow through the actuator 65 in response to an input electrical signal. A hydraulic pump 112 is used for pressurizing the fluid and a motor means 114 for driving the pump 112 . The hydraulic fluid is stored in a reservoir 110 . Means are provided for monitoring the angular position of the actuator 65 and a load cell means 26 coupled to the member provides a signal proportional to the magnitude of force applied directly to the member 14 . A microprocessing means 126 is used for controlling the input electrical signal to the servo valve 78 in response to the signal of the load cell, the angular position of the actu ator 65 , program means stored in the microprocessor 126 and calibration data.
