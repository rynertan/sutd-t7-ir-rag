# Disarmed T DNA.

## Abstract
Disarming mutations of tmr and tms T DNA genes are disclosed which are useful in an Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmid based plant transformation vector. As disarmed T DNA is compatible with standard plant regeneration protocols, such a vector may be used to introduce a plant expressible foreign gene into a dicot plant. Methods for use of disarmed T DNA are provided as are morphologically normal transformed plants. The invention is exemplified by introduction of a Phaseolus vulgaris lectin gene into tobacco.

## Description
DISARMED T DNAFIELD The present invention is in the fields of genetic engineering and plant husbandry, and especially provides a means for transforming a plant to contain a foreign gene by way of a plant transforming prokaryotic plasmid vector, and further provides plant cells transformed by such a vector.BACKGROUND L. W. Ream et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 1660 1664, disclose a T DNA, harbored by strain A3004, having a deletion of a spa I fragment between positions 7,257 and 9,442 removing sequences from the structural genes for both tmr and tms. Ream et al. further report that when a strain having the tmr tms deletion and an insertion in tml is inoculated on stems of Kalanchoe tubiflorae opines were made. Ream et al.did not report regeneration of plants from tmrtms or tmr tms tml mutants, nor did they demonstrate that plant cells were transformed to contain tmr tms tml T DNA. T. C. Hall et al., U.S. patent application ser. nos. 485,613 and 485,614 , disclose designs of a tmr tms disarming mutations having substitutions of a cam gene for T DNA sequences between the position 5,512Hind III site and the position 9,062 BamH I site, and between the position 3,390 Hind III site and the position 9,062 BamH I site.Shuttle Vectors Shuttle vectors, developed by G. B. Ruvkun and F. M. Ausubel 1981 Nature 289 85 88, provide a way to insert foreign genetic materials into position of choice in a large plasmid, virus, or genome. There are two main problems encountered when dealing with large plasmids or genomes.Firstly, the large plasmids may have many sites for each restriction enzyme. Unique site specific cleavage reactions are not reproducible and multi site cleavage reactions followed by ligation lead to great difficulties due to the scrambling of the many fragments whose order and orientation one does not want changed. Secondly, the transformation efficiency See EP A 0122791 and EP A 0126546 respectively. with large DNA plasmids is very low. Shuttle vectors allow one to overcome these difficulties by facilitating the insertion, often in vitro, of the foreign genetic material into a smaller plasmid, followed by transfer, usually by ftn vivo techniques, to the larger plasmid. A shuttle vector consists of a DNA molecule, usually a plasmid, capable of being introduced into the ultimate recipient bacteria having a replicon that can be maintained independently therein. It also includes a copy of the fragment of the recipient genome into which the foreign genetic material is to be inserted and a DNA segment coding for a selectable trait, which is also inserted into the recipient genome fragment.The selectable trait marker is conveniently inserted by transposon mutagenesis in vivo or by in vitro use of restriction enzymes and ligases. The shuttle vector can be introduced into the ultimate recipient cell, typically a bacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae which contains the genus Agrobacterium , by a tri parental mating Ruvkin and Ausubel, supra , direct transfer of a self mobilizable vector in a bi parental mating, direct uptake of exogenous DNA by Agrobacterium cells transfor mation , using the conditions of M. Holsters et al. 1978 Molec. Gen.Genet. 163 181 187 , by spheroplast fusion of Agrobacterium with another bacterial cell, by uptake of liposome encapuslated DNA, or infection with a shuttle vector that is based on a virus that is capable of being packaged in vitro. A tri parental mating, a technique well known to those skilled in the art of manipulation of large plasmids found in members of the family Rhizobiaceae, involves the mating of a strain containing a mobilizable plasmid, which carries genes for plasmid mobilization and conjugative transfer, with the strain containing the shuttle vector. If the shuttle vector is capable of being mobilized by the plasmid genes, the shuttle vector is transferred to the recipient cell containing the large genome, e.g. the Ti or Ri plasmids of Agrobacterium strains. After the shuttle vector is introduced into the recipient cell, possible events include a double cross over with one recombinational event on either side of the marker. This homogenotization event will result in transfer of a DNA segment containing the marker to the recipient genome replacing a homologous segment lacking the insert. To select for cells that have lost the original shuttle vector, the shuttle vector must be incapable of replicating in the ultimate host cell or be inc√èmpaE e 6th an independently selectable plasmid pre existing in the recipient cell.One common means of arranging this is to conjugally introduce another plasmid which is incompatible with the shuttle vector and which carries a different drug resistance marker. Therefore, when one selects for resistance to both drugs, the only surviving cells are those in which the marker on the shuttle vector has recombined with the recipient genome. If the shuttle vector carries an extra marker, one can then screen for and discard strains that contain plasmids resulting from a single cross over event between the shuttle vector and the recipient plasmid resulting in cointegrates in which the entire shuttle vector is integrated with the recipient plasmid. If the foreign genetic material is inserted into or adjacent to the marker that is selected for, it will also be integrated into the recipient plasmid as a result of the same double recombination.It might also be carried along when inserted into the homologous fragment at a spot not within or adjacent to the marker, but the greater the distance separating the foreign genetic material from the marker, the more likely will be a recombinational event occurring between the foreign genetic material and marker, preventing transfer of the foreign genetic material. If the shuttle vector is used to introduce a phenotypically dominant trait e.g. a novel expressible insecticide structural gene, but not an inactivated oncogenic T DNA gene one need not rely on a double homologous recombination. The cells resulting from a single cross over event resulting in cointegrate plasmids can transfer the desired trait into plant cells A. Caplan et al. 1983 Science 222 815 821 R. B. Horsch et al. 1984 Science 223 496 498 . One may even use a variant shuttle vector having a single uninterrupted sequence of T DNA. However, as the resulting T DNA will now contain a tandem duplication, one must be vigilant regarding a possible rare deletion of the shuttle vector by a single homologous recombination event occurring between the two homologous sequences in either the Agrobacterium or plant cells. Shuttle vectors have proved useful in manipulation of Agrobacterium plasmids see D. J. Garfinkel et al. 1981 Cell 27 143 153 A. J. M.Matzke and M. D. Chilton 1981 J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1 39 49 and J. Leemans et al. 1981 J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1 149 164, who referred to shuttle vectors by the term intermediate vectors or it . A recently disclosed variation of the shuttle vector system for inserting changes into large DNA molecules is the suicide vector . In this system, as described by R. Simon et al. 1983 Biotechnol. 1 784 791, the shuttle vector replicon cannot be maintained independently within the recipient cell. This property eliminates the need to introduce an incompatible plasmid into the recipient cell in order to exclude the shuttle vector as is commonly done during a triparental mating. All vector sequences which do not integrate into some already present DNA effectively commit suicide by not being replicated. As can be done with traditional types of shuttle vectors, one may distinguish between double and single homologous by screening for an antibiotic resistance gene which is not between the two regions of homology.Use of suicide vectors to transferDNA sequences into a Ti plasmid has also been reported by E. Van Haute et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 411 417 L. Comai et al. 1982 Plant. Molec.Biol. 1 291 300 L. Comai et al. 1983 Plasmid 10 21 30 P. Zambryski et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 2143 2150 P. Zahm et al. 1984 Mol. Gen. Genet.194 188 194 and Caplan et al., supra. C. H. Shaw et al. 1983 Gene 28 315 330, report use of a suicide vector to introduce a foreign DNA into a Ti plasmid without also introducing a selectable marker by means of selection of a single homologous recombinant followed by screening for a double homologous recombinant. An alternative to the use of homologous recombination for introduction of novel DNA sequences into T DNA involves bacterial transposons. As described in the section Agrobacterium Genes on the TIP Plasmids, transposons can jump into the T DNA of a TIP plasmid e.g. see D. J.Garfinkel et al. 1981 Cell 27 143 153 . Should the transposon be modified in vitro by the insertion of the novel sequence, that novel DNA can be transferred into the TIP plasmid s T DNA by the transposon. The TIP can then transfer the novel DNA transposon T DNA combination to a plant cell when it will be stably integrated. Overview of Agrobacterium Included within the gram negative bacterial family Rhizobiaceae which also includes the genus Rhizobium , in the genus Agrobacterium, are the species A. tumefaciens and A. rhizoyenes. These species are respectively the causal agents of crown gall disease and hairy root disease of plants. Crown gall is characterized by the growth of a gall of dedifferentiated tissue. Hairy root is a teratoma characterized by inappropriate induction of roots in infected tissue. In both diseases, the inappropriately growing plant tisssue usually produces one or more amino acid derivatives, known as opines, not normally produced by the plant which are catabolized by the infecting bacteria. Known opines have been classified into three main families whose type members are octopine, nopaline, and agropine.The cells of inappropriately growing tissues can be grown in culture, and, under appropriate conditions, be regenerated into whole plants that retain certain transformed phenotypes. Virulent strains of Agrobacterium harbor large plasmids known as Ti tumor inducing plasmids pTi in A. tumefaciens and Ri root inducing plasmids in A. rhizogenes pRi . Curing a strain of these plasmids results in a loss of pathogenicity. Ti and Ri plasmids both contain DNA sequences, referred to as T DNA transferred DNA , which in tumors are found to be integrated into the genome of the host plant. The T DNA encodes several transcripts. Mutational studies have shown that some of these are involved in induction of tumorous growth, though the exact phenotype is host dependent. Mutants in the genes for tml, tmr, and tms, respectively result in large tumors in tobacco , a propensity to generate roots, and a tendency for shoot induction.The T DNA also usually encodes the gene s for at least one opine synthase, and the Ti plasmids are often classified by the opine which they caused to be synthesized. Each of theT DNA genes is under control of a T DNA promoter. The T DNA promoters resemble eukaryotic promoters in structure, and they appear to function only in the transformed plant cell. The Ti plasmid also carries genes outside the T DNA region. These genes are involved in functions which include opine catabolism, oncogenicity, agrocin sensitivity, replication, and autotransfer to bacterial cells. The Ri plasmid is organized in a fashion analogous to the Ti plasmid. The set of genes and DNA sequences responsible for transforming the plant cell are hereinafter collectively referred to as the transformation inducing principle TIP .The designation TIP therefore includes, but is not limited to, both Ti and Ri plasmids. The integrated segment of a TIP is termed herein T DNA transferred DNA , whether derived from a Ti plasmid or an Ri plasmid. M. D. Chilton June 1983 Sci. Amer. 248 6 50 59, has recently provided an introductory article on the use of Ti plasmids as vectors.Recent general reviews of Agrobacterium caused disease include those byD. J. Merlo 1982 , Adv. Plant Pathol. 1 139 178 L. W. Ream and M, P.Gordon 1982 , Science 218 854 859 M. W. Bevan and M. D. Chilton 1982 ,Ann. Rev. Genet. 16 357 384 G. Kahl and J. Schell 1982 MolecularBiology of Plant Tumors K. A. Barton and M. D. Chilton 1983 Meth.Enzymol. 101 527 539 and A. Caplan et al. 1983 Science 222 815 821. A number of more specialized reviews can be found in A. Puhler, ed. 1983 Molecular Genetics of the Bacteria Plant Interaction, including a treatment by D. Tepfer of A. rhizogenes mediated transformation.Infection of Plant Tissues Plant cells can be transformed by Agrobacterium in a number of methods known in the art which include but are not limited to co cultivation of plant cells in culture with Agrobacterium, direct infection of a plant, fusion of plant protoplasts with Agrobacterium spheroplasts, direct transformation by uptake of free T DNA by plant cell protoplasts, transformation of protoplasts having partly regenerated cell walls with intact bacteria, transformation of protoplasts by liposomes containing T DNA, use of a virus to carry in the T DNA, microinjection, and the like. Any method will suffice as long as the gene is stably transmitted through mitosis and meiosis. The infection of plant tissue by Agrobacterium is a simple technique well known to those skilled in the art for an example, see D. N. Butcher et al. 1980 in Tissue Culture Methods for Plant Pathologists, eds. D. S. Ingram and J. P. Helgeson, pp. 203 208 . Typically a plant is wounded by any of a number of ways, which include cutting with a razor, puncturing with a needle, or rubbing with abrasive. The wound is then inoculated with a solution containing tumor inducing bacteria. An alter native to the infection of intact plants is the inoculation of pieces of tissues such as potato tuber disks D. K. Anand and G. T. Heberlein 1977 Amer. J. Bot. 64 153 158 or inverted segments of tobacco stems K. A.Barton et al. 1983 Cell 32 1033 1043 . After induction, the tumors can be placed in tissue culture on media lacking phytohormones. Hormone independent growth is typical of transformed plant tissue and is in great contrast to the usual conditions of growth of such tissue in culture A. C. Braun 1956 Cancer Res. 16 53 56 . Agrobacterium is also capable of infecting isolated cells and cells grown in culture L. Marton et al. 1979 Nature 277 129 131 and isolated tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. In the latter technique, after allowing time for partial regeneration of new cell walls, Agrobacterium cells were added to the culture for a time and then killed by the addition of antibiotics. Other workers R. B. Horsch and R. T. Fraley 1983 in Advances in Gene Technology Molecular Genetics of Plants and Animals MiamiWinter Symposium 20 , eds. K. Downey et al., p. 576 have reported transformations by co cultivation of plant and Agrobacterium cells, leading to a high rate greater than lOg of calli displaying hormoneindependent growth, with 95 of those calli making opines. M. R.Davey et al. 1980 in Ingram and Helgeson, supra, pp. 209 219, describe the infection of older cells that had been regenerated from protoplasts. The transformation frequency of inoculated callus pieces can be increased by addition of an opine or opine precursors L. M. Cello and W. L. Olsen,U.S. Patent 4,459,355 . Plant protoplasts can be transformed by the direct uptake of TIP plasmids. M. R. Davey et al. 1980 Plant Sci. Lett. 18 307 313, andM. R. Davey et al. 1980 in Ingram and Helgeson, supra, were able to transform Petunia protoplasts with the Ti plasmid in the presence of poly L a ornithine to a phenotype of opine synthesis and hormone independent growth in culture. It was later shown J. Draper et al. 1982 Plant and Cell Physiol. 23 451 458 M. R. Davey et al. 1982 in Plant TissueCulture 1982, ed A. Fujiwara, pp. 515 516 that polyethelene glycolstimulated Ti plasmid uptake and that some T DNA sequences were integrated into the genome. F. A.Krens et al. 1982 Nature 296 72 74, reported similar results using polyethelene glycol following by a calcium shock, though their data suggests that the integrated T DNA included flanking non T DNA Ti plasmid sequences. An alternative method to obtain DNA uptake involves the use of liposomes. The preparation of DNA containing liposomes is well known in the art. Preparations for the introduction of Ti DNA via liposomes have been reported T. Nagata et al. 1982 in Fujiwara, supra, pp. 509 510 T. Nagata 1981 Mol. Gen. Genet. 184 161 165 . An analogous system involves the fusion of plant and bacterial cells after removal of their respective cell walls. An example of this technique is the transformation of Vinca or Nicotiana protoplast by Agrobacterium or E. coli spheroplasts S. Hasezawa et al. 1981 Mol. Gen. Genet. 182 206 210 R. Hain et al. 1984 Plant Cell Rept. 3 60 64 . Plant protoplasts can take up cell wall delimited Agrobacterium cells S. Hasezawa et al. 1982 in Fujiwara, supra pp. 517 518 . T DNA can be transmitted to tissue regenerated from a fusion of two protoplasts, only one of which had been transformed G. J. Wullems et al. 1980 Theor. Appl. Genet. 56 203 208 . As detailed in the section onRegeneration of Plants, T DNA can pass through meiosis and be transmitted to progeny as a simple Mendelian trait. The host range of crown gall pathogenesis may be influenced by T DNAencoded functions A. Hoekema et al. 1984 J. Bacteriol. 158 383 385 .R. L. Ausich, European Patent Application 108,580, reports transfer ofT DNA from A. tumefaciens to green algal cells, and expression therein of octopine synthase and Tn5 kanamycin resistance genes.Regeneration of Plants Differentiated plant tissues with normal morphology have been obtained from crown gall tumors. A. C. Braun and H. N. Wood 1976 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 73 496 500, grafted tobacco teratomas onto normal plants and were able to obtain morphologically normal shoots that could flower, make opines and grow independently of phytohormones when placed in culture. L. Otten et al. 1981 Molec Gen. Genet. 183 209 213, usedTn7 transposon generated Ti plasmid mutants in the tms shoot inducing locus to create tumors which proliferated shoots. When these shoots were regenerated into plants, they were found form self fertile flowers. The resultant seeds germinated into plants which contained T DNA and made opines. The tms phenotype, which can be considered suppression of root formation, can be partly overcome by washing of the rooting area and can be bypassed by grafting onto a normal stock A. Wostemeyer et al. 1984 Mol. Gen. Genet. 194 500 507 . Similar experiments with a tmr rootinducing mutant showed that full length T DNA could be transmitted through meiosis to progeny, that in those progeny nopaline genes could be expressed, though at variable levels, and that cotransformed yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene was not expressed K. A. Barton et al. 1983 Cell 32 1033 1043 .It now appears that regenerated tissues which lack T DNA sequences are decended from untransformed cells which contaminate the tumor G. Ooms et al. 1982 Cell 30 589 597 or from cells that have deleted some or all T DNA F. M. Yang et al. 1980 In Vitro 16 87 92 F. Yang et al. 1980 Molec. Gen. Genet. 177 707 714 M. Lemmers et al. 1980 J. Mol. Biol. 144 353 376 F. Yang and R. B. Simpson 1981 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 4151 4155 H. DeGreve et al. 1982 supra andJ. Memelink et al. 1983 Mol. Gen. Genet. 190 516 522 . Genes involved in opine anabolism were capable of passing through meiosis, though the plants were male sterile, and seemingly unalteredT DNA can be inherited in a Mendelian fashion G. J. Wullems et al. 1981 Cell 24 719 724 G. Wullems et al. 1982 in Fujiwara, supra H. DeGreve et al. 1982 Nature 300 752 755 . Genetically, tms and functional opine synthase genes are closely linked in regenerated plants A. Wtstemeyer et al. 1984 Mol. Gen. Genet. 194 500 507 . Functional foreign genes are also inherited in a dominant Mendelian manner R. B. Horsch et al. 1984 Science 223 496 498 , as is Ri T DNA D. Tepfer 1984 Cell 37 959 967 . The epigenetic state of the plant cells initially transformed can affect regeneration potential G. M. S. van Slogteren et al. 1983 PlantMol. Biol. 2 321 333 . Recent work by A. N. Binns 1983 Planta 158 272279, indicates that tumorogenic genes, in this case tmr, can be shut off during regeneration and turned back on by placing regenerated tissue in culture. Roots resulting from transformation from A. rhizogenes have proven relatively easy to regenerate directly into plantlets M. D. Chilton et al. 1982 Nature 295 432 434 , and are easily cloned. Regenerability from hairy roots appears to be dependent on T DNA copy number C. David et al. 1984 Biotechnol. 2 73 76 .Genes on the TIP Plasmids The complete sequence of the T DNA of an octopine type plasmid found in ATCC 15955, pTi15955, has been reported and includes fourteen open reading frames ORFs flanked by eukaryotic transcriptional control sequences R. F. Barker et al. 1983 Plant Molec. Biol. 2 335 350 . The sequence of the TL region of pTiAch5, which is closely related to pTi15955, has also been reported J. Gielen et al. 1984 EMBO J. 3 835846 . T DNA genes do not contain introns intervening sequences commonly found in eukaryotic genes which are posttranscriptionally spliced out of the messenger precursor during maturation of the mRNA and do have sequences that resemble eukaryotic transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites. A number of genes have been identified within the T DNA of the TIP plasmids. Several octopine plasmid T DNA transcripts have been mapped S. B. Gelvin et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 76 80 L. Willmitzer et al. 1982 EMBO J. 1 139 146, N. Murai and J. D. Kemp 1982 Nucleic Acids Res. 10 1679 1689 S. J. Karcher et al. 1984 Mol.Gen. Genet. 194 159 165 and some functions have been assigned J. Leemans et al. 1982 EMBO J. 1 147 152 . Some of these regions, specifically those encoding tmr and tms, can also be transcribed in prokaryotic cells G. Schrnder et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 403 409 . The Ti plasmid genes tms, tmr, tml, and ocs have been well defined by transposon mutagenesis D. J.Garfinkel et al. 1981 Cell 27 143 153 . Ti plasmids having single mutations in these genes respectively incite tumorous calli of Nicotiana tabacum which generate shoots, proliferate roots, are larger than normal, and do not synthesize octopine. In other hosts, mutants of these genes can induce different phenotypes see M. W. Bevan and M. D. Chilton 1982 Ann. Rev. Genet. 16 357 384 . The phenotypes of tms and tmr are correlated with differences in the phytohormone levels present in the tumor. The differences in cytokinin auxin ratios are similar to those which in culture induce shoot or root formation in untransformed callus tissue D. E.Akiyoshi et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 407 411 A. N. Binns 1983 Planta 158 272 279 A. Caplan et al. 1983 Science 222 815 821 R. M. Amasino and C. O. Miller 1982 Plant Physiol. 69 389 392 . The tms locus encodes enzymes involved in auxin synthesis D. Inze et al. 1984 194 265 274 . T DNA containing a functional gene for tmr alone, but not functional tml alone or either of the two tms transcripts alone, can proP mote significant tumor growth. The two tms transcripts can together promote tumor growth. Promotion of shoots and roots is respectively stimulated and inhibited by functional tml L. W. Ream et al. 1983 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 1660 1664 D. Inze et al., supra . Mutations inT DNA genes do not seem to affect the insertion of T DNA into the plant genome Leemans et al. 1982 supra Ream et al. 1983 supra . T DNA genes need not be located between border sequences see TIP Plasmid DNA to promote hormone independent growth H. Joos et al. 1983 EMBO J.2 2151 2160 . Octopine Ti plasmids carry an ocs gene which encodes octopine synthase lysopine dehydrogenase . All of the signals necessary for expression of the ocs gene are found within 295 bp of the ocs transcriptional start site C. Koncz et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 1597 1603 . P. Dhaese et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 419 426, reported the utilization of various poly.adenylation sites by transcript 7 ORF3 of Barker et al., supra and ocs. The presence of the enzyme octopine synthase within a tissue can protect that tissue from the toxic effect of various amino acid analogs G. A. Dahl and J. Tempe 1983 Theor. Appl. Genet. 66 233 239 G.

TR DNA of octopine type Ti plasmids carries at least three genes involved in synthesis of the agropine family of opines J. G. 11 is et al. 1984 Mol. Gen. Genet. 195 466 473 . Nopaline Ti plasmids encode the nopaline synthase gene nos , which has been sequenced by A. Depicker et al. 1982 J. Mol. Appl. Genet.1 561 573. All of the signals necessary for expression of the nos gene are found within 261 bp of the nos transcriptional start site C. Koncz et al., supra . A gene for agrocinopine synthase and genes equivalent to tms and tmr have been identified on a nopaline type plasmid H. Joos et al. 1983 Cell 32 1057 1067 , and a number of transcripts have been See EP A 0140556. mapped L. Willmitzer et al. 1983 Cell 32 1045 1056 . J. C. McPhersson et al. 1980 Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2666 2670, reported the in vitro translation of T DNA encoded mRNAs from crown gall tissues. Transcription from hairy root T DNA has also been detected L. Willmitzer et al. 1982 Mol. Gen. Genet. 186 16 22 . Functionally, the hairy root syndrome appears to be equivalent of a crown gall tumor incited by a Ti plasmid mutated in tmr F. F. White and E. W. Nester 1980 J. Bacteriol. 144 710 720 as tms Ti plasmids and Ri plasmids can complement each other when inoculated onto plants, resulting in calli capable of hormone independent growth G. M. S. van Slogteren 1983 Ph.D.thesis, Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, Netherlands . In eukaryotes, methylation especially of cytosine residues of DNA is correlated with transcriptional inactivation genes that are relatively under methylated are transcribed into mRNA. S. B. Gelvin et al. 1983 Nucleic Acids Res. 11 159 174, has found that the T DNA in crown gall tumors is always present in at least one unmethylated copy. That the same genome may contain numerous other copies of T DNA which are methylated suggests that the copies of T DNA in. excess of one may sometimes be biologically inert. See also G. Ooms et al. 1982 Cell 30 589 597. Treatment of a tumor line with 5 azacytidine results in demethylation of aT DNA gene which is paralleled by an increase in transcription A. G.Hepburn et al. 1983 J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 2 315 329 . 5 azacytidine treatment or grafting have been shown to activate silent opine genes G. M. S. van Slogteren 1983 supra. The Ti plasmid encodes other genes which are outside of the T DNA region and are necessary for the infection process. See M. Holsters et al. 1980 Plasmid 3 212 230 for nopaline plasmids H.

Most important are the onc genes, which when mutated result in Ti plasmids incapable of oncogenicity. These loci are also known as vir, for virulence. Several onc genes have been accurately mapped and have been found to be located in regions conserved among various Ti plasmids H. J. Klee et al. 1983 J. Bacteriol. 153 878 883 V. N. Iyer et al. 1982 Mol. Gen. Genet. 188 418 424 .

Hoekema et al. 1984 J.Bacteriol. 158 383 385 . Nopaline Ti DNA has direct repeats of about 25 base pairs immediately adjacent to the left and right borders of the T DNA which might be involved in either excision from the Ti plasmid or integration into the host genome N. S. Yadav et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 6322 6326 , and a homologous sequence has been observed adjacent to an octopine T DNA border R. B.Simpson et al. 1982 Cell 29 1005 1014 . Opine catabolism is specified by the occ and noc genes, respectively, of octopine and nopaline type plasmids. The Ti plasmid also encodes functions necessary for its own reproduction including an origin of replication. Ti plasmid transcripts have been detected in A. tumefaciens cells by S. B. Gelvin et al. 1981 Plasmid 6 17 29, who found that T DNA regions were weakly transcribed along with non T DNA sequences. Ti plasmid determined characteristics have been reviewed by Merlo, supra see especially Table II therein , andReam and Gordon, supra.TIP Plasmid DNA Different octopine type Ti plasmids are nearly 100 homologous to each other when examined by DNA hybridization T.

Homologies between octopine. and nopaline type Ti plasmids, one of which overlapped the T DNA region, were mapped in detail by G. Engler et al. 1981 J. Mol.Biol. 152 183 208. One of the homologous regions also has homology with aSym plasmid involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation from a species of Rhizobius, a different genus of the family Rhizobiaceae R. K.

Ri T DNA contains extensive though weak homologies to T DNA from both types of Ti plasmid L. Willmitzer et al. 1982 Mol. Gen.

White et al. 1983 Nature 301 348 350, L. Spano et al. 1982 Plant Molec. Biol. 1 291 300 . G. A. Huffman et al. 1984 J. Bacteriol. 157 269 276, have shown that in the region of cross hybridization, the Ri plasmid pRiA4b is more closely related to a pTiA6 octopine type than pTiT37 nopaline type and that this Ri plasmid appears to carry sequence homologous to tms but not tmr. Their results also suggested that Ri T DNA may be discontinuous, analogous to the case with octopine T DNA see below . The restriction map of pRiA4b was also disclosed by Huffman et al., supra. Weak homologies have been observed between pRi8196 and several Ti plasmids in regions assignable to opine metabolic functions no nucleic acid cross hybridization was observed in T DNA encoding tumor morphology functions K.

It has been shown that a portion of the Ti M. D. Chilton et al. 1977 Cell 11 263 271 or Ri M. D. Chilton 1982 Nature 295 432 434 F. F. White et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 3193 3197 L.

Much non T DNA Ti plasmid DNA appears to be transferred into the plant cell prior to T DNA integration H. Joos et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 2151 2160 . M. F. Thomashow et al. 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 6448 6452 and M. F. Thomashow et al. 1980 Cell 19 729 739, found the T DNA from octopine type Ti plasmids to have been integrated in two separate sections, TL DNA and TR DNA, left and right T DNAs, respectively. The copy numbers of TR and TL can vary in different tumor lines D. J. Merlo et al. 1980 Molec. Gen. Genet. 177 637 643 . A core of T DNA is highly homologous to nopaline T DNA Chilton et al. 1978 supra, and Depicker et al. 1978 supra , is required for tumor maintenance, is found in TL, is generally present in one copy per cell, and codes for the genes tms, tmr, and tml. On the other hand, TR can be totally dispensed with M. De Beuckeleer et al. 1981 Molec. Gen. Genet. 183 283 288, G. Ooms et al. 1982 Cell 30 589 597 and can be found in a high copy number Merlo et al. 1980 supra . G.Ooms et al. 1982 Plasmid 7 15 29, hypothesized that TR is involved in T DNA integration, though they find that when TR is deleted from the Ti plasmid, A. tumefaciens does retain some virulence. G. Ooms et al. 1982 Cell 30 589 597, showed that thoughT DNA is occasionally deleted after integration in the plant genome, it is generally stable and that tumors containing a mixture of cells which differ in T DNA oryanization are the result of multiple transformation events. The ocs gene is found in TL but can be deleted from the plant genome without loss of phenotypes related to tumorous growth. Octopinetype T DNA borders have been sequenced R. F. Barker et al. 1983 PlantMol. Biol. 2 335 350 , are 24 base pair imperfect direct repeats of each other, and are homologous with direct repeats found at either end of nopaline T DNA. Plant DNA flanking integrated left border of TL has been observed to be composed of repeats of T DNA sequences which are in either direct or inverted orientations R. B. Simpson et al. 1982 Cell 29 10051014 . M. Holsters et al. 1983 Mol. Gen. Genet. 190 35 41, found TL to be integrated in tanden copies separated by a linker of about 400 bp originating from both plant and T DNA sequences. In contrast to the situation in octopine type tumors, nopaline T DNA is integrated into the host genome in one continuous fragment M. Lermners et al. 1980 J. Mol. Biol. 144 353 376, P. Zambryski et al. 1980 Science 209 1385 1391 . Direct tandem repeats were observed. T DNA of plants regenerated from teratomas had minor modifications in the border fragments of the inserted DNA Lemmers et al., supra . Sequence analysis of the junction between the right and left borders revealed a number of direct repeats and one inverted repeat. The latter spanned the junction Zambryski et al. 1980 supra . The left junction was shown to vary by at least 70 base pairs while the right junction varies no more than a single nucleotide P. Zambryski et al. 1982 J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1 361370 .Left and right borders in junctions of tandem arrays were separated by spacers which could be over 130 bp. The spacers were of unknown origin and contained some T DNA sequences. T DNA was found to be integrated into both repeated and low copy number host sequences. H. Joos et al. 1983 Cell 32 1057 1067, have shown that virulence is not eliminated after deletion of one of either of the usual nopaline T DNA border sequences. The orientation of the right nopaline border can be reversed without loss of functionality, and a single border sequence may be capable of transforming closely linked sequences M. De Block et al. 1984 EMBO J. 3 1681 1689 . Simpson et al. 1982 supra, and Zambryski et al. 1980 supra have suggested that the direct repeats in the border regions are involved in integration of T DNA into plant DNA. That T DNA having borders from two different Ti plasmids are less specifically integrated than are homologous borders supports this suggestion G. Ooms et al. 1982 Plant Molec. Biol. 1 265 276 . A chi x site, which in the bacteriophage X augments general recombination in the surrounding DNA as far as 10 kilobases away, is present in a nopaline Ti plasmid just outside the left end of the T DNA N.,S. Yadav et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 6322 6326 but not in an octopine Ti plasmid in an equivalent position R. B. Simpson et al. 1982 Cell 29 1005 1014 . Barker et al., supra, observed two chi sequences, both well within TLDNA. The significance of the chi in Ti plasmids is not known. Manipulations of the TIP Plasmids As detailed in the section on Shuttle Vectors, technology has been developed for the introduction of altered DNA sequences into desired local tions on a TIP plasmid. Transposons can be easily inserted using this technology D. J. Garfinkel et al. 1981 Cell 27 143 153 . A DNA sequence e.g. a bacterial transposon inserted into T DNA in the Ti plasmid can be transferred and integrated into the recipient plant s genome J. P. Hernalsteen et al. 1980 Nature 287 654 656 , and can then be recovered in a fully functional and seemingly unchanged form M. Holsters et al. 1982 Mol. Gen. Genet. 185 283 289 . Though insertion of foreignDNA has been done with a number of genes from different sources, to date non dicot foreign genes have not usually been expressed in plant cells under control of their own promoters.Sources of these genes include rabbit B globin C. H. Shaw et al. 1983 Gene 23 315 330 , alcohol dehydrogenase 2 from yeast K. A. Barton et al. 1983 Cell 32 1033 1043 ,AdhI J. Bennetzen, unpublished from corn, interferon and globin from mammals, and the mammalian virus SV40 J. Schell, unpublished . However, when the nopaline synthase gene was inserted into octopine T DNA and transformed into plant tissue, it was found to be fully functional C.

Herrera Estrella et al. 1984 Nature 310 115 120, report that a 900 bp fragment of DNA from the 5 upstream region of the same gene is sufficient to confer light inducible expression in tobacco callus to a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene. Deletions can be generated in a TIP plasmid by several methods.Shuttle vectors can be used to introduce deletions constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques. Deletions with one predetermined end can be created by the improper excision of transposons B. P. Koekman et al. 1979 Plasmid 2 347 357 and G. Ooms et al. 1982 Plasmid 7 15 29 .J. Hille and R. Schilperoot 1981 Plasmid 6 151 154, have demonstrated.that deletions having both ends at predetermined positions can be generated by use of two transposons. The technique can also be used to construct recombinant DNA molecules in vivo. P. Zambryski et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 2143 2150, report use of a vector, deleted for all nopalineT DNA genes except nos and transcript a, which on tobacco promotes the formation of very small calli and leads to the regeneration of plants having normal morphology. The nopaline synthase promoter has been used for insertion of DNA segments coding for drug resistance that can be used to select for transformed plant cells. In plant cells, a bacterial kanamycin resistance gene from Tn5 is not transcribed under control of its own promoter J. D.

Herrera Estrella et al. 1983 EMBO J. 2 987 995, have inserted the kanamycin resistance gene neomycin phosphotransferase II , or kan NPT2 , from Tn5 behind i.e. under control of the nopaline synthase promoter.The constructions were used to transform plant cells which in culture displayed resistance to kanamycin and its analogs such as G418. Herrera Estrella et al., supra, reported a similar construction, in which a metho trexate resistance gene dihydrofolate reductase from Tn7 was placed behind the nos promoter. Transformed cells were resistant to methotrexate, an antagonistic analog of folic acid. In work utilizing cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV as a vector, a dihydrofolate reductase gene from R67 behind the CaMV 35S promoter similarly conferred methotrexate resistance to infected turnip plants N. Brisson et al. 1984 Nature 310 511 514. Furthermore, L. Herrera Estrella et al. 1983 Nature 303 209 213, have obtained expression in plant cells of enzymatic activity for octop ine synthase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, an enzyme which in bacteria confers resistance to chloramphenicol, by placing the structural genes for these two enzymes under control of nos promoters.The nos drug resistance combinations are inherited from transformed plants in a Mendelian manner R. B. Horsch et al. 1984 Science 223 496 498 M. De Block et al. 1984 EMBO J. 3 1681 1689 . G. Helmer et al. 1984 Biotechnol. 2 520 527, have created a fusion gene having the promoter and 5 end of the structural gene of nos fused to E. coli ss galactosidase lacZ sequences. Plant tissues transformed with this construction may be recognized by a characteristic color when grown on the appropriate chromogenic substrate. Murai et al., supra, reported the fusion of the ocs promoter and the 5 end of the octopine synthase structural gene to the structural gene for the bean seed protein phaseolin. A fusion protein having the amino terminus of octopine synthase and lacking the amino terminus of phaseolin was produced under control of the T DNA promoter. The introns, which were contributed by the phaseolin sequences, were posttranscriptionally processed properly. A. J. de Framond et al. 1983 Biotechnol. 1 262 269, has reported on the construction a mini Ti plasmid , a plasmid which could be maintained in A. tumefaciens and lacked almost all non T DNA pTi sequences. By itself, this plasmid was not able to transform plant cells. However when placed in an A. tumefaciens strain containing an octopine Ti plasmid, tumors were induced which synthesized both octopine and nopaline. Mini Ti plasmids can also be transferred into plant cells when complemented with aTi plasmid deleted for its own T DNA. These results indicated that the non T DNA functions acted in trans with T DNA, that the missing nopalineTi plasmid functions were complemented by the octopine Ti plasmid, and that the nopaline mini Ti was functional for the transformation of plant cells.A similar pair of complementing plasmids, each containing either octopine T DNA or onc genes, has been constructed by A. Hoekema et al. 1983 Nature 303 179 180. Chilton et al. 18 January 1983 15th Miami Winter Symp., reported on the construction of a micro Ti plasmid made by resectioning the mini Ti of de Framond et al., supra, with Sma I to delete essentially all of T DNA but the nopaline synthase gene and the left and right borders. The micro Ti was inserted into a modified pRK290 plasmid that was missing itsSma I site, and was employed in a manner similar to mini Ti, with comparable results. G. A. Dahl et al., US pat. application ser. no. 532,280 discloses micro Ti plasmids carrying ocs genes constructed from the TL region of the octopine type plasmid pTi15955.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of this invention is to provide a means for transforming a plant to contain a plant expressible foreign gene. In pursuance of this goal, another object is to provide nonrevertable e.g. deletions and substitutions double mutations of the TIP genes tms and tmr, i.e.disarming mutations, the mutations being well defined as to their exact locations and being compatible with regeneration of whole plants from cultured tissues. Other objects are to provide means for simultaneously incorporating the disarming mutation and a plant expressible foreign gene into T DNA, to provide a means to transform plant cells that are compatible with plant regeneration protocols known to the art, and to provide several means for selecting for the incorporation into T DNA of the disarming mutation and or the plant expressible foreign gene. Other objects will be apparant to those skilled in the art from the present disclosure. The invention disclosed herein provides a disarming mutation, i.e.deletion or substitution of sequences that are part of both the tmr and tms. Disarming substitutions include replacements of T DNA by foreign genes which are plant expressible and bacterial genes specifying resistances to the antibiotics kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Shuttle vectors and Ti plasmids carrying disarmingmutati4ns zre also provided. Methods for construction of disarming mutations are taught as are interactions to be considered when combining various embodiments of the present invention or when combining the present invention with other processes or structures known to the art. Methods suitable for transformation of plant cells with disarmed T DNA and methods suitable for regeneration of plants transformed by the disarmed T DNA are also taught. The experimental work presented herein is believed to be the first disclosure that plant cells are capable of being regenerated into morphologically normal plants after being transformed with T DNA disarmed by inactivation of tmr and tms and no other genetic loci. It is recognized in the art that during recombinant DNA manipulations, a cryptic promoter might possibly come to be placed in front of a structural gene or fragment thereof, the cryptic promoter having position and orientation relative to the structural gene sequences as to allow transcription of those sequences. It is also recognized that interruptions, deletions, or other changes in protein sequence which are expected to interfere with protein function, do not always inactivate the modified protein.Without the results disclosed herein, it is unobvious that morphologically normal plants would indeed be obtained from plant cells transformed by disarmedT DNA. As disarmed T DNA transformed callus grows more slowly than wildtype transformed callus, it was also unobvious that the transformation frequency resulting from use of the vectors and methods of the present invention would be as high as was found with undisarmed vectors. High transformation rates permit the recovery of transformed tissue by screening, i.e. testing individual cloned tissue pieces or regenerated plants for a transformed phenotype. Lower transformation rates would necessitate selection of transformed cells, i.e. a mixture of transformed and untransformed cells are subjected to conditions whereby untransformed cells are killed and transformed cells survive without high rates.Plantexpressible selectable markers would have to be present in the T DNA transformation vectors and transformed cells would have to be subjected to selection steps, thereby increasing the complexity of tissue handling protocols prior to plant regeneration. It is known in the art that increased time and nonphysiological conditions in tissue culture can adversely affect the phenotype of regenerated plants. The present invention is useful for producing genetically modified plant cells, plant tissues, and whole plants, especially when the transforming disarmed T DNA also carries a useful structural gene plantexpressible promoter combination. In particular, the present invention provides a means to insert foreign DNA into a plant genome in a manner consistent with the regeneration of morphologically normal plants. Use of a deletion or substitution to construct a disarming mutation is advantageous as these classes of mutations cannot revert. Other useful aspects of the present invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the present disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1, taken from R. F.

T DNA Refers herein to a segment of DNA derived from the transformation inducing principle TIP which becomes integrated into a plant genome. As used herein, the term includes DNA originally derived from any tumor inducing strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In addition, as used herein the term T DNA includes alterations, modifications, mutations, insertions, and deletions, either naturally occurring or introduced by laboratory procedures, a structural requirement being that sufficient of the right and left ends i.e. borders of naturally occurring T DNAs be present to ensure the expected function of stable integration which is characteristic of all T DNA. Positions within T DNA are defined as in unmodified T DNA of pTi15955, as published by R. F. Barker et al. 1983 Plant Mol. Biol. 2 335 350.Positions of unmodified homologous T DNAs are positions homologous to those defined in pTi15955. Directions are defined so that rightward is in the direction of higher numbered positions.Though T DNAs other than that of pTi15955 might not have particular restriction sites at exactly the same sites as pTi15955, there may be sites specific to other restriction enzymes reasonably close, i.e. within about one hundred base pairs, to the sites used to construct the disarming mutations disclosed herein DNA constructions using such sites are within the scope of the present invention as are pTil5955 derived DNA constructions using restriction sites similarly reasonably close to the position 5,512 Hind III site and position 9.062 BamH I site. T DNA sequence Refers herein to any DNA sequence derived from T DNA as defined above. A T DNA sequence need not be bound by T DNA borders. Disarming mutation Refers herein to a mutation which causes loss of function of both tmr and tms. Inactivation of either of the two tmr encoded enzymes is sufficient to cause loss of function of tmr. A disarming mutation may have more than one component, e.g. the term includes insertion into T DNA of two transposons, one each into tmr and tms. A disarming mutation can exist in a functional T DNA or in aT DNA sequence lacking T DNA borders. Disarmed T DNA Refers herein to a T DNA lacking functional tmr and tms genes derived from a T DNA that had functional tmr and tms genes. In most cases, a T DNA carrying a disarming mutation will be a disarmedT DNA. Exceptions can include situations where tmr and tms have been duplicated. For example, when a shuttle vector carrying a disarming mutation forms a cointegrate with a T DNA by single homologous recombination, the tmr tms region can become duplicated. Although a disarming mutation as defined above will be present, the T DNA will still carry functional copies of tmr and tms. Plant tissue Includes differentiated and undifferentiated tissues of plants including, but not limited to, roots, shoots, pollen, seeds, and tumor tissue, such as crown galls, and various forms of aggregations of plant cells in culture, such as embryos and calluses. The plant tissue may be in planta or in organ, tissue, or cell culture. Plant cell As used herein includes plant cells in planta, in plant tissues as defined above, and plant cells and protoplasts in culture. Plant expressible foreign gene Refers herein to a gene that, when in a plant genome, is expressed in at least one tissue during at least one developmental stage but is not found in naturally occurring T DNAs. Plant detectable marker Includes genes that when in a plant genome are expressed in cells in culture or in at least one tissue during at least one developmental stage and that facilitates identification of cells, tissues, or plants that have been transformed by a T DNA carrying the detectable marker. Detectable markers include both selectable markers e.g. ocs bacterial antibiotic resistance genes placed behind a plant, plant virus, or T DNA i.e. plant expressible promoter etc. and screenable markers e.g. opine synthases or a plant expressible promoter structural gene combination expressing an enzyme that, when provided an appropriate substrate, causes a color change etc. . Production of a genetically modified plant transformed by disarmedT DNA combines the specific teachings of the present disclosure with a variety of techniques and expedients known in the art. The fundamental aspects of the present invention include the construction of disarmedT DNA, combination of disarmed T DNA with a plant expressible foreign gene, transformation of a plant cell by the combination, and regeneration of a plant descended from the transformed cell. In most instances, alternative expedients exist for each stage of the overall process. The choice of expedients depends on variables and choices, including the following T DNA and T DNA sequence sources whether tmr and tms is inactivated by insertion, deletion, or substitution which plant expressible foreign gene is to be inserted into the disarmed T DNA where that foreign gene is to be inserted whether a plant detectable marker is included within the disarmed T DNA, and if so, which marker and where positioned how theT DNA disarming mutation foreign gene detectable marker combination is to be assembled plant species and variety to be transformed inoculation method protocol for culturing transformed tissues means for detecting which cells are transformed method for regenerating the transformed tissue to form a morphologically normal plant and the like, all of which present alternative process steps which those of ordinary skill are able to select and use to achieve a desired result. As previously discussed and exemplified herein, a tmr tms disarming mutation is most advantageously constructed by deleting sequences from those two genes. Two situations that can result from deletions, also previously discussed, are that residual gene product activity may remain even though tmr or tms sequences are missing and that cryptic promoters may be inadvertantly juxtaposed with a structural gene. Either situation might lead to a tmr or tms phenotype or otherwise interfer with regeneration of transformed plants. The results disclosed herein demonstrate a deletion of T DNA sequences between the position 5,512 Hind III site and the position 9,062 BamH I site disarms T DNA in a manner consistant with the regeneration of transformed plants.In other words, a deletion ofT DNA sequences from a position reasonably close, i.e. within about one hundred base pairs, to the Hind III site towards tmr has a tms phenotype, and a deletion of T DNA sequences from a position reasonably close to theBamH I site towards tms has a tmr phenotype. Deletion of non pTi15955T DNA sequences homologous to the above specified pTi15955 sequences are within the scope of the present invention. The combination of the tmr and tms phenotypes by deletion or substitution of T DNA sequences between the Hind III and BamH I sites in a transformed plant cell is demonstrated herein to be compatible with regeneration of a whole plant from the transformed cell. With time, disarming mutations bound by other restriction sites may be found to be compatible with regeneration of normal plants these embodiments are within the scope of the present invention. In the preferred embodiments, the Hind III and BamH I sites may either be directly ligated to each other, thereby forming a deletion, as exemplified and discussed in Example 7, or may be linked by a DNA fragment having at least one gene, thereby forming a substitution. The substituting DNA may include a bacterial drug resistance gene useful for incorporation by means of marker exchange of the disarming mutation into T DNA and or a plant expressible foreign gene. It is well understood in the art of genetics that a substitution may be considered a deletion of a removedDNA sequence followed by an insertion of other DNA into the resulting gap , in the present invention a substitution is considered to be within the scope of an equivalent deletion, equivalent mutations being ones that remove the same or homologous DNA sequences from an unmodified DNA.Substitutions of a kan gene lectin gene combination and of a cam gene are exemplified herein Examples 4 and 6, respectively . Alternatively, a plant expressible foreign gene may be incorporated into T DNA independently from incorporation of the disarming mutation. As discussed in Example 4, independent incorporation of a foreign gene may be used to inactivate a T DNA gene in addition to disarming mutation inactivated tmr and tms. The orientation of the inserted foreign gene, with respect to the direction of transcription and translation of endogenousT DNA genes is not critical, either of the two possible orientations being functional. Differences in rates of expression may be observed when a given gene is inserted at different locations within T DNA, possibly because of such factors as chromatin structure. Differences in rates of expression also may vary depending on whether the plant expressible foreign gene is inserted into disarmed T DNA in TL or in TR, as the gene copy number may vary.A single copy of TL is generally transferred into a plant genome, while multiple copies of TR can be found in transformed plant tissues. Location of the foreign gene within T DNA is not critical as long as the transfer function of sequences immediately surrounding theT DNA borders are not disrupted, since these regions appear from prior art studies to be essential for insertion of the modified T DNA into the plant genome, and as long as the foreign gene is not placed in TC centralT DNA . Prior art studies have not demonstrated whether TC is integrated into plant genes further studies may indicate that TC is an acceptable alternative to TL and TR. The present invention is useful for facilitating the genetic modification of plant cells, plant tissues, and whole plants by inserting useful foreign structural genes from other species, organisms, varieties, or strains, the structural genes being under control i.e. behind plantexpressible promoters. Many useful plant expressible promoters are known to the art and the discovery of more such promoters is expected in the art. A plant expressible promoter structural gene combination constitutes a plant expressible foreign gene if the combination is incorporated intoT DNA. Considerations concerning combination of promoters and structural genes are understood in the art.Useful structural genes include, but are not limited to, genes conveying phenotypes such as follows improved tolerance to extremes of heat or cold improved tolerance to drought or osmotic stress improved resistance or tolerance to insect e.g. insecticidal toxins , arachnid, nematode, or epiphyte pests and fungal, bacterial, or viral diseases the production of enzymes or secondary metabolites not normally found in said tissues or plants improved nutritional e.g. storage proteins, lectins, etc. , flavor e.g. sweet proteins , or processing properties when used for fiber or human or animal food changed morphological traits or developmental patterns e.g. leaf hairs which protect the plant from insects, coloring which is aesthetically pleasing, changed plant growth habits, dwarf plants, reduced time needed for the plants to reach maturity, expression of a gene in a tissue or at a time that gene is not usually expressed, and the like male sterility improved photosynthetic efficiency including lowered photo respiration improved nitrogen fixation improved uptake of nutrients improved tolerance to herbicides increased crop yield improved competition with other plants and improved germplasm identification by the presence of one or more characteristic nucleic acid sequences, proteins, or gene products, or phenotypes however identified to distinguish a genetically modified plant or the present invention from plants which are not so modified, to facilitate transfer of a linked artificially introduced phenotype by other e.g. sexual means to other genotypes or to facilitate identification of plants protected by patents or by plant variety protection certificates resistance in cell or tissue culture to selective agents i.e. selectable markers and the like. The invention is exemplified by the introduction into and expression in plant cells of a Phaseolus vulgaris lectin gene behind its own promoter. The introduction and expression of a novel lectin may be used to change the nutritional or symbiotic properties or a plant tissue. Other uses of the invention, exploiting the properties of other structural genes introduced into various plant species and placed behind various plant expressible promoters, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Once designed, a disarming mutation and any disarming mutation foreign gene combination is constructed by the methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art of recombinant DNA. A disarming mutation and or foreign gene may be incorporated into T DNA, thereby forming disarmed T DNA, by means of a shuttle vector, as is well understood and as has been described in the Background and exemplified in Example 6. The disarming mutation may be incorporated into any T DNA with which it has sufficient homology to recombine with, possibly including T DNAs which are not from octopine type Ti plasmids. After a Agrobacterium cell harboring a plant expressible foreign gene disarmed T DNA combination is produced, the cell is used to transform a plant cell. Methods useful for plant cell transformation are reviewed in the Background section on Infection of Plant Tissues. In the preferred embodiments, stem segments are inverted relative to their normal orientation and placed on a solidified medium, as described by K. A. Barton et al. 1983 Cell 32 1033 1043. The callus resulting after culture of the inverted stem segments is then preferably removed from the segment and placed on a medium suitable for callus culture supplemented with a bacteriocidal antibiotic capable of killing the inoculating A. tumefaciens strain.Other alternatives for producing an Agrobacterium free callus culture include supplementing the stem culture medium with antibiotic. As originally produced, a callus is a mosaic of transformed and untransformed cells. A plant regenerated from such a callus will likewise be a mosaic. Seed produced from such a plant will be a mixture of transformed and untransformed seed. To increase the genetic uniformity of a regenerated plant, one may single cell clone transformed callus. aj,ngle cell cloning may be accomplished by any means known to the art. Typically, a callus piece known to contain transformed cells is placed in liquid culture. The resultant suspension culture is sieved to isolate single cells and very small cell clumps. The resultant filtrate is plated onto solid medium at a density consistant with growth of the cells or clumps into callus. As is understood in the art, plating onto a solid medium containing feeder cells is sometimes advantageous. Transformed plant tissues may be identified after regeneration from cloned callus. However, in the preferred embodiments, transformed calli are identified before plant regeneration. As exemplified herein, one may screen individual callus pieces of a transformed phenotype. Screening of transformed tissues for tissues expression the foriegn structural gene may be done by immunological means, including micro ELISAs dnzyme linked immuno sorbant assays , a technique well known to those skilled in the art of immunochemistry, and Western blots of antigens after electrophoresis through SDS polyacrylamide gels e.g as described by R. P. Legocki andD. P. S. Verma 1981 Analyt. Biochem. 111 385 392 . Southern, Northern e.g., P. S. Thomas 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 77 5201 5205 and dot blots, all methods well known to those skilled in the art of molecular biology, may be used to detect incorporated DNA and expressed RNA. Assays for opine production e.g. octopine and mannopine are characteristic of TL and TR from pTi15955, respectively are also indicative of the presence ofT DNA. Additionally, the phenotype of an expressed foreign gene can be used to identify transformed tissue e.g. insecticidal properties of an insecticidal toxin . Selection of transformed cells may be done with the drugs and selectable markers described in the Background Manipulation of the TIP Plasmids . Selection is most readily accomplished by providing a selectable marker incorporated into the T DNA disarmed foreign gene combination.Examples of selectable markers include either dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin phosphotransferase expressed under control of a nopaline synthase promoter. These markers are selected by growth in medium containing methotrexate or kanamycin, respectively, or their analogs. In addition, the T DNA can provide an endogenous marker such as a gene controlling resistance to toxic compounds such as amino acid analogs. Such resistance is provided by an opine synthase gene, ocs, to about 10 pg ml S 2 aminoethyl L cysteine AEC G. A. Dahl and J. Tempe 1983 Theor. Appl. Genet. 66 233 239, G. A. Dahl et al., U.S. Patent application ser. no. 532,280 .The exact drug, drug concentration, plant tissue, plant species, and cultivar must be carefully matched and chosen for ability to regenerate and for efficient selection. Single cell clones may be selected either by plating a suspension culture directly onto a selective medium or by transferring pieces of cloned callus to a selective medium. An object of the present invention is to provide a means to transform a plant cell that is compatible with plant regeneration protocols known to the art. After isolation of a transformed callus, plants are regenerated using known methods developed for regeneration of untransformed callus of that species, as exemplified herein with tobacco. However, it is recog nized that for some plant species, untransformed tissue regeneration conditions may have to be modified for regeneration of disarmed T DNA transformed callus.Example 9 demonstrates that disarmed T DNA transformed tobacco callus may be regenerated by well known methods shoots are induced from callus grown on an auxin, 1 naphthalene acetic acid NAA , and a cytokinin kinetin by removal of the auxin from the culture medium subsequently the resultant shoots are induced to root by being cultured on a medium lacking both auxin and cytokinin. The genotype of the plant tissue transformed is often chosen for the ease with which its cells can be grown and regenerated in In vitro culture and for susceptibility to the selective agent to be used. Should a cultivar of agronomic interest be unsuitable for these manipulations, a more amenable variety is first transformed. After regenerationt the newly introduced disarmed T DNA foreign gene combination is readily transferred to the desired agronomic cultivar by techniques well known to those skilled in the arts of plant breeding and plant genetics. Sexual crosses of transformed plants with the agronomic cultivars yielded an initial hybrid. These hybrids can then be back crossed with plants of the desired genetic background.Progeny are continuously screened and selected for the continued presence of integrated T DNA or for the new phenotype resulting from expression of the inserted plant expressible foreign gene. In this manner, after a number of rounds of back crossing and selection, plants can be produced having a genotype essentially identical to the agronomically desired parents with the addition of the inserted disarmedT DNA foreign gene combination. EXAMPLES The following Examples utilize many techniques well known and accessible to those skilled in the arts of molecular biology and manipulation ofTIPs and Agrobacterium such methods are fully described In one or more of the cited references if not described in detail herein. Enzymes are obtained from commerical sources and are used according to the vendor s recommendations or other variations known to the art. Reagents, buffers, and culture conditions are also known to those in the art. Reference works containing such standard techniques include the following R. Wu, ed. 1979 Meth. Enzymol. 68 R. Wu et al., eds. 1983 Meth. Enzymol. 100 and 101 L. Grossman and K. Moldave, eds. 1980 Meth. Enzymol. 65 J. H.Miller 1972 Experiments in Molecular Genetics R. Davis et al. 1980 Advanced Bacterial Genetics R. F. Schleif and P. C. Wensink 1982 Practical Methods in Molecular Biology and T. Maniatis et al. 1982 Molecular Cloning. Additionally, R. F. Lathe et al. 1983 Genet. Engin.4 1 56, made useful comments on DNA manipulations. Textual use of the name of a restriction endonuclease in isolation, e.g. BamH I , refers to use of that enzyme in an enzymatic digestion, except in a diagram where it can refer to the site of a sequence susceptable to action of that enzyme, e.g. a restriction site. In the text, restriction sites are indicated by the additional use of the word site , e.g. BamH I site . The additional use of the word fragment , e.g. BamH I fragment , indicates a linear double stranded DNA molecule having ends generated by action of the named enzyme e.g. a restriction fragment . A phrase such as Bcl I BamH I fragment indicates that the restriction fragment was generated by the action of two different enzymes, here Bcl I and BamH I, the two ends resulting from the action of different enzymes. Note that the ends will have the characteristics of being sticky i.e. having a single stranded protrusion capable of base pairing with a complementary single stranded oligonucleotide or blunt and that the specificity of a sticky end will be determined by the specificity of the enzyme which produces it. Plasmids, and only plasmids, are prefaced with a p , e.g., pTi15955 or pUC19, and strain designation followed parenthetically by a plasmid name indicates that a plasmid is harbored within that strain, e.g.,A. tumefaciens pTi15955 or E. coli K802 pUC19 . The following strains are on deposit E. coli C600 pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec NRRL B 15821 A. tumefaciens pTi15955 ATCC 15955 E. coli C600 pKS4 NRRL B 15394 E. coli HB101 pPVL134 ATCC 39181 NRRL strains being with the Northern Regional Research Center, 1815 N.University St., Peoria, Illinois 61604 USA, and ATCC strains being with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Maryland 20852 USA. Other plasmids and strains are widely available and accessible to those in the art.Example 1 The right end of the disarming deletion p203 is a plasmid having BamH I fragment 17 of pTi15955 4.5 kbp inserted into the BamH I site of pBR322. p203 was digested with BamH I and the 4.5 kbp T DNA fragment was isolated by elution from an agarose gel after electrophoretic separation. After the 4.5 kbp fragment was mixed with and ligated to BamH I linearized, CIAP digested pKS4 which may be isolated from E. coli C600 pKS4 , NRRL B 15394 , the reaction mixture was transformed into E. coli HB101. CIAP calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylates pKS4 s BamH I sticky ends, thereby preventing religation of pKS4 molecules not having T DNA inserts, a method well known in the art. pKS4 is a pBR322 derivative carrying a kanamycin resistance gene kan, encoding the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase II derived from the transposon Tn5.DNAs isolated from transformants resistant to kanamycin and ampicillin were characterized by mapping of restriction enzyme cleavage sites and a colony harboring a plasmid designated p203 Kan was identified. p203 Kan had the BamH I fragment 17 ligated to the Tn5derived kan gene the T DNA EcoR I sites being distal to the kan gene and the kan promoter being distal to the T DNA Fig. 2 .Example 2 The left end of the disarming deletion p103 is a plasmid having Hind III fragment of pTi15955 2.1 kbp inserted into the Hind III site of pBR322. p103 was digested withHind III and the 2.1 kbp T DNA fragment was isolated by elution from an agarose gel after electrophoretic separation. After the 2.1 kbp fragment was mixed with and ligated to Hind III linearized, CIAP digested p203 Kan, the reaction mixture was transformed into HB101. DNAs isolated from transformants resistant to kanamycin and ampicillin were characterized by restriction mapping and a colony harboring a plasmid designated p203 Kan 103 was identified. p203 Kan 103 had the T DNA of p103 inserted into p203 Kan, the p1O3 sequences and the p203 sequences being in the same relative orientation as they originally did in pTi15955 Fig. 3 . Example 3 Transfer to a shuttle vector p203 Kan 103 was digested with EcoR I and a 6.6 kbp fragment having the kan gene surrounded by T DNA was isolated by elution from an agarose gel after electrophoretic separation. After the 6.6 kbp fragment was mixed with and ligated to EcoR I linearized, CIAP digested pRK290, the reaction mixture was transformed into E. coli C600. DNAs isolated from transformants resistant to tetracycline and kanamycin were characterized by restriction maping and a colony harboring a plasmid designated pRK 203 Kan 103 was identified. pRK 203 Kan 103 had the EcoR I T DNA kan fragment inserted into pRK290 with p1O3 sequences proximal to the tetracycline resistance gene of pRK290, and carried sequences which constitute a disarming mutation Fig. 4 Example 4 Insertion of plant expressible genes pLec5.7 L.M Hoffman 1984 J. Mol. Appl. Genet., pXLec5.7 therein is a plasmid having inserted into the Hind III site of pBR322 a 5.7 kbpHind III fragment of DNA from the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., encoding a plant expressible gene for a lectin. The pLec5.7 coding sequence is identical to that of pPVL134, a lectin cDNA clone. pLec5.7 was digested with Hind III and a 5.7 kbp fragment of Phaseolus DNA was isolated by elution from an agarsoe gel after electrophoretic separation. After the 5.7 kbp fragment was mixed with and ligated to Hind IIIlinearized, CIAP digested pRK 203 Kan 103, the reaction mixture was transformed into C600. DNAs isolated from transformants resistant to tetracycline and kanamycin were characterized by restriction mapping and a colony harboring a plasmid designated pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec was identified. pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec has Phaseolus DNA inserted into pRK 203 Kan 103 between the p103 and the kan sequences, the lectin promoter being proximal to the kan sequences Fig. 5 . The lectin gene can be removed from pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec by digestion with Hind III, religation to itself, transformation into an appropriate bacterial host, and screening for lack of a 5.7 kbp Hind III fragment, thereby regenerating pRK 203 Kan 103. The combination of the lectin gene with the disarming mutation exemplifies combination of the mutation with other plant expressible gene. Plant expressible genes on DNA fragments not terminated by Hind III sticky ends can be inserted in the place of the Phaseolus DNA by other methods which are well understood in the art. The ends of the DNA to be inserted can be converted to Hind III ends by use of the appropriate liners. Alternatively, the ends of both the insert and the Hind IIIlinearized pRK 203 Kan 103 can be converted to blunt ends that can then be joined by blunt end ligation. Plant expressible genes may also be inserted at other locations in pRK 2O3 Kan 103, e.g. the unique BamH I site at the junction between the pKS4 and p203 derived fragments. Any restriction site unique to pRK 203 Kan 103 that is found within the pKS4 derived fragment may also be used.Indeed, any unique sites within the p103 and p203 derived fragments may be used, though the probability of the insert being incorporated by double homologous recombination into a Ti plasmid along with the kan marker decreases as the distance between the insert and the marker is increased, as is well understood in the art. An alternative to the insertion of a plant expressible gene intoT DNA at the site of a disarming mutation is insertion elsewhere in theT DNA. An example of insertion of a plant expressible gene into T DNA has been provided by N. Murai et al. 1983 Science 222 476 482, who have inserted the gene for phaseolin into the structural gene for tml.A. tumefaciens pTi529R of Murai et al. is on deposit as NRRL B 15379.The constructions described therein can not readily be combined with those exemplified herein as both use kan as a selectable marker however, analogous manipulations using combinations of different antibiotic resistance genes to drive marker replacement will be evident to those skilled in the art. Replacement of kan with a chloramphenicol resistance cam gene is exemplified in Example 6, and construction of a deletion lacking a drug resistance marker is exemplified in Example 7. When tobacco tissue transformed by a disarmed T DNA phaseolin gene combination is regenerated into a plant and allowed to flower, high levels of phaseolin sequences are found to be expressed in developing tobacco seeds.Example 5 Integration of the disarming mutation into pTI15955 pRK 203 Kan 103 and pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec were integrated into pTi15955 using the strategy as described in the Background section on Shuttle Vectors. Triparental matings were generally accomplished as described below other variations known to those skilled in the art are also acceptable. E. coli C600 pRK290 based shuttle vector was mated with E. coliRR1 pRK2013 and ATCC 15955, an A. tumefaciens strain harboring the octopine type Ti plasmid pTi15955. The pRK2013 was transferred to the shuttle vector carrying strain and mobilized the shuttle vector for transfer to the Agrobacterium.Growth on a minimal medium incapable of supporting the growth of E. coli, AB glucose or AB sucrose, containing both tetracycline and the drug to which the shuttle vector is resistant, often either kanamycin or chloramphenical, resulted in the selection of Agrobacterium cells containing shuttle vector sequences. A mating of these cells with E. coli pPH1J1 , strain 2104, resulted in the transfer of pPH1J1 to the Agrobacterium cells. pPH1J1 and pRK290 based shuttle vectors cannot coexist for long in the same cell. Growth on 100 mg l gentamycin and either kanamycin or chloramphenical selected for cells which have Ti plasmids that had undergone single or double homologous recombination events cointegration or homogenotization, respectively with the shuttle vector and now carried the desired construction.The selected colonies were then screened for tetracycline sensitivity, sensitive strains being homogenotes. Commonly used antibiotic concentrations were as follows 25 mg l or 10 mg l tetracycline in E. coli and 5 mg l tetracycline Agrobacterium, 25 mg l kanamycin, and 25 mg l chloramphenicol. E. coli and A. tumefaciens strains were usually grown in L broth at 370C and 280C, respec tively. pRK290 and pRK2013 were disclosed by G. Ditta et al. 1980 Proc. natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 7347 7357, and pPH1J1 by P. R. Hirsh 1978 Thesis, Univ. E. Anglia. Other octopine type Ti plasmids, e.g. pTiA6, pTiA66, etc., which are homologous to pTi15955, may be substituted for that plasmid indeed, any TIP T DNA having enough homology to permit marker exchange may be substituted. The pTi15955 derivatives of pRK 203 Kan 103 and pRK 203 Kan 103 Lec are respectively designated herein as pTi15955 RS Kan and pTil5955 RS Kan Lec.Example 6 Replacement of kan with cam pBR325 F. Bolivar 1978j Gene 4 121 136 DNA, having been grown inE. coli GM48 a dam host that does not methyl ate DNA in a manner incompatible with the action of Bcl I, M. G. Marinus 1973 Molec. Gen. Genet. 127 47 55 , was digested with Bcl I and BamH I, religated to itself, and transformed into E. coli Lucy M. A. Zarowitz 1983 Ph.D. thesis, Univ.Missouri Columbia . DNA isolated from transformants resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol but sensitive to tetracycline were characterized by restriction analysis, and a colony harboring a plasmid designated pBR325aBB, lacking the Bcl I BamH I fragment of pBR325, was identified. The Bcl I BamH I suture of pBR325aBB is not susceptable to the action of either Bcl I or BamH I. After pBR325aBB DNA was digested with Hinc II, the digestion mixture was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and a 1.8 kbp Hinc II fragment carrying a chloramphenicol resistance cam gene eluted from the gel. After pUC19 DNA J. Norrander et al. 1983 Gene 26 101 106 digested with Hinc II and CIAP was mixed with and ligated to the Hinc II cam fragment, the ligation mixture was transformed into K802.Plasmid DNAs isolated from chloramphenicol resistant transformants were characterized by gel electrophoresis and a colony harboring a plasmid designated pUCam19, having a cam gene inserted into the pUC19 polylinker, was identified. pUCaml9 DNA digested by BamH I and Hind III was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and a 1.8 kbp fragment carrying a cam gene was eluted from the gel. After the cam fragment was mixed with and ligated to pRK290 203 Kan 103 that had been digested with BamH I, Hind III, and CIAP, the ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli RR1 and selected for chloramphenicol resistant transformants. Plasmid DNAs from such transformants were characterized by restriction mapping and a colony harboring a plasmid having the pBR325 cam gene substituted for the pKS4 kan gene of pRK 203 Kan 103 was identified. The cam substituted plasmid is herein designated pRK 203 Cam 103 Fig. 6 . The disarmed mutation was introduced into the kan disarmed Ti plasmid pTi15955 RS Kan by the protocol of Example 5. A. tumefaciens cells selected on minimal media containing sucrose, chloramphenicol, and gentamycin were screened for kanamycin sensitivity, thereby detecting replacement by double homologous recombination of the kan gene with the cam gene. One homogenote was detected among the approximately 500 colonies screened.DNA from a colony sensitive to kanamycin and resistant to chloramphenicol was characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blotting to confirm the incorporation of cam and the elimination of kan. The resultant tmr tms Ti plasmid, designated herein as pTi15955 RS Cam, can be combined with the kan linked tml mutants of Murai et al., supra, as discussed inExample 4.Example 7 Deletion of bacterial drug resistance markers It is advantageous to have a disarmed mutation without a bacterial drug resistance marker substituted for tmr and tms sequences when one wishes to drive double homologous recombination of several other DNA sequences into a disarmed Ti plasmid, thereby allowing an antibiotic resistance gene otherwise used to disarm the pTi to be used to integrate another non T DNA sequence. This Example describes the construction of such a disarming mutation. pRK 203 Kan 103 or pRK 203 Cam 103 DNA is digested with BamH I andHind III. After the sticky ends are converted to blunt ends by incubation with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and all four dNTPs, a method well known in the art, the vector is blunt end ligated to itself.Alternatively, the linearized vector is mixed with and ligated to aBamH I Hind III linker, digested with either BamH I or Hind III to remove extra linkers, and then ligated to itself. The reaction mixture resulting from either of the above procedures is transformed into an appropriate host e.g. C600 , selected for resistance to tetracycline, and screened for sensitivity to kanamycin or chloramphenicol, depending on the plasmid starting material. Plasmid DNAs from the selected and screened transformants are characterized by restriction analysis and a colony is identified which harbors a plasmid, designated herein as pRK 203 103, hiving p203T DNA sequences directly joined to p103 T DNA sequences. pRK 203 103 is integrated into pTi15955 essentially as described inExample 6 for the integration of pRK 203 Cam 103. pRK 203 103 is transferred as part of a triparental mating into a A. tumefaciens cell harboring either pTi15955 RS Kan or pTi15955 RS Cam. After selection of tetracycline resistant cell, introduction of pPH1J1 and selection for gentamycin resistant cells, the transformants are screened for kanamycin or chloramphenicol sensitivity, depending on which disarmed Ti plasmid is used as a starting material. The presence of an antibiotic resistance less disarming mutation in the pTi is confirmed by restriction analysis and Southern blotting, methods well known in the art.This tmr tms Ti plasmid, designated herein as pTi15955 RS, can be combined with the kanlinked tml mutants of Murai et al., supra, as discussed in Example 4.Example 8 Inoculation of Tobacco Stems Stems of sterile Nicotiana tabacum var. Xanthi were cut into segments approximately 1 cm. long. These segments were placed basal end √πp inPetri dishes containing Murashige and Skoog medium MS medium pH 5.8 without hormonal supplement Table 1 , a medium well known in the art.The basal upper ends were then inoculated with A. tumefaciens cells harboring disarmed Ti plasmids by puncturing the cut surface of the stem with a syringe needle. After 3 weeks of incubation at 280C with 16 hr light and 8 hr dark, callus tissue developed at the upper surface of all stem segments. The callus regions were then transferred to MS medium containing 2.0 mg l NAA, 0.3 mg l kinetin and 0.5 mg ml carbinicillin.After 4 weeks on this medium, the tissues were free of bacteria and could be assayed for the presence of opine, a methodology well understood in the art. Approximately 80 of the tissues were found to be opine positive. Once free of inciting bacteria, the transformed plant tissues were grown on MS medium at 250C with 16 hr light and 8 hr dark. These tissues were cloned using a suspension method described by A. N. Binns andF. Meins 1979 Planta 145 365 369. Briefly, tissues were placed in liquid MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg i NM and 0.1 mg l kinetin, and shaken at 135 rpm at 280C for 10 14 days. The resultant suspensions were filtered successively through 0.543 and 0.213 mm mesh sieves, concentrated, and plated at a final density of 8 x 10 cells ml in MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg l NM and 0.3 mg l kinetin. After these had grown to approximately 100 mg, colonies were split into 2 pieces.One was placed on complete MS medium and the other was screened for the presence of opines. Approximately 0 50X of the colonies were found to be opinepositive, depending on the particular parental uncloned callus piece from which the colonies were descended. Uncloned pieces having higher concentrations of octopine tended to yield higher percentages of octopine positive clones. Example 9 Regeneration of Recombinant Plants Tissues from various opine positive clones were transferred onto MS medium supplemented with 0.3 mg l kinetin and cultured at 280C with 16 hr light and 8 hr. dark. Shoots initiated were subsequently rooted by placing them in a medium consisting of MS salts without hormones. Rooted plantlets were transferred to soil and placed at high humidity in a greenhouse. After 7 10 days, the plants were then grown with normal greenhouse conditions. All of the regenerated plants derived from opine positive clones contained opines. The presence of opines indicated thereby that these normal looking plants had been transformed by the disarmed T DNA. When screening for expression of lectin sequences, pTi15955 RS Lec transformed plants are found to have high expression in seeds and low expression in other tissues.
