# A process of electrodepositing a ruthenium iridium alloy and a bath for use therein.

## Abstract
A process of electrodepositing a ruthenium iridium alloy on a conductive substrate is provided which in volves placing the substrate in a bath containing a soluble ruthenium compound, a soluble iridium com pound, a fluoborate and fluoboric acid and making the substrate cathodic. The process is especially useful for electrodepositing a ruthenium iridium alloy on a sub strate made of a valve metal, e.g. titanium, to make an insoluble electrode.
