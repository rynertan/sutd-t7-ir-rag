# Sodium ion conducting glasses and batteries embodying such glasses.

## Abstract
A sodium ion conducting glass characterised in that it has a resistivity of not more than 10‚Åµ ohm cm at 300 C, is resistant to corrosive attack by liquid sodium and to devitrification and comprises, as calculated from the glass batch in cation percent, from 32 to 44 Na and the re mainder essentially a mixture of Si, B and Al wherein the Si content is from 10 to 40 of the total Si B Al con tent, the Al content is from 5 to 60 of such total and the B content is from 15 to 70 thereof is disclosed. A sodium sulphur battery having a liquid sodium anode, a liquid sulphur sodium sulphide mixture as a cathode and a thin glass membrane separating the anode and cathode liquids, characterised in that the membrane is formed from such a glass is also disclosed, as is such a glass in the form of a membrane for such a battery. The present invention affords numerous advantages over the prior art.
