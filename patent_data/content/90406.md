## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to food and drink that are good for health and increase absorption of calcium or iron. More particularly, it relates to food and drink that are good for health and increase absorption of calcium or iron which is characterized in that there is added to the food or drink a casein phosphopeptide that is produced by enzymatic degradation with trypsin of casein.3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For many years, milk has been known for its ability to provide complete nutrition. It is regarded as the best food in terms of calcium supply. Calcium, in turn, is the most abundant metal in the human body and is absorbed by humans in formation of bones and teeth, as well as in metabolism and various reactions and mechanisms of the living body. The effect of milk is attributable not only to the calcium content but also to the property of digestion and absorption or, otherwise stated, the high efficacy of utilization. Various studies have pointed out the contributions of lactose in milk, calcium binding protein present in small quantities, or casein itself. In addition to the active transport at the upper part of small intestine controlled by the regulation of vitamine D and various hormones t Hiroshi Naito,Chemistry and Biology, 18, 554 558 1980 3 , the importance of passive transport at the lower part of the small intestine has again been recognized in the absorption of calcium by the body. To explain how calcium in milk is efficiently absorbed by the body, it is suggested that a phosphopeptide present in material produced when casein has been decomposed by pancreatic enzymes, particularly trypsin, solubilizes calcium in the small intestine, thus increasing the amount of soluble calcium and working as the enhancer of calcium absorption LH. Naito, A. Kawakami, T. Imamura, Agricultural andBiological chemistry, 36, 409 415 1972 Y. S. Lee, T.Noguchi, H. Naito, British Journal of Nutrition, 43, 457 467 1980. It is widely accepted that calcium should be solubilized in order to be absorbed through the small intestine. The peptide is called casein phosphopeptide hereinafter referred to as cpp . It is known that there are two representative types of cpp, namely, one derived from ss casein p cpp and another derived from alpha casein alpha cpp . Their structures and various constants are as shown in Table 1. ss cpp has been extensively studied and its structure has been determined. Manson, W. D. Annan,Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 145, 16 26 1971 . The structure in Table 1 for cpp is estimated, hence it may be further degraded.

The present inventors have studied whether calcium solubilizing activity by cpp produced in vivo, as noted above, is shared also by cpp produced in vitro, and found that the latter cpp also has a significant solubilizing activity of calcium. Based on this new finding, the inventors have invented health food and drink that have a superior enhancing effect on calcium absorption by adding cpp produced in vitro to food, whereby calcium may be absorbed by the body in the form of a solubilized calcium. This is considered a significant improvement in digestion and absorption of calcium which has heretofore been efficiently done a very limited number of food and drink such as milk. The present inventors have also studied absorption of iron and found that cpp produced in vitro has a solubilizing capability on iron and increase iron absorption. It is widely believed that iron must be solubilized in order for it to be absorbed through the small intestine. Based on the new finding, the inventors have invented health food and drink that have a superior enhancing effect on iron absorption by adding cpp produced in vitro to food, whereby iron may be absorbed by the body in the form of a solubilized iron. This is also considered a significant improvement in digestion and absorption of iron which has heretofore been efficiently absorbed through a limited number of food and drink, such as heme or meat products. The present invention is to provide food and drink containing cpp that are good for health.4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION cpp employed in the present invention has the above described properties and may be produced by any of the following methods. In one method, casein is hydrolized with a crystalline trypsin to produce cpp, after which the reaction mixture is adjusted to a pH value of 4.5 5.0 to eliminate the unreacted casein and part of the impurities by precipitation, followed by addition to the supernatant of barium chloride and ethanol to the final concentration of 50 v v to precipitate and recover cpp R. F. Peterson, L. W. Nouman and T. L. McMeekin, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 80, 95 99 1958 . Alternatively, cpp, produced by hydrolysis of casein with a crystalline trypsin, may be fractionated and separated by chromatographic techniques such as gel permeation chromatography or ion exchange chromatography. The present inventors have studied new methods of recovering cpp. As a result, it was found that cpp may be recovered at a high purity by using a metal ion other than barium chloride, such as calcium, iron or magnesium and, where necessary, by using a hydrophilic solvent. Use of calcium or iron ion is industrially advantageous because the produced cpp may be added to food or drink without removing the calcium or iron. The inventors have also studied methods of eliminating the bitter taste of casein hydrolysate. It was found that the bitter taste may be effectively eliminated by passing the hydrolysate through a column containing activated carbon or ion exchange resin, without substantial impairment of cpp. cpp employed in the invention inhibits precipitation of calcium and keeps the calcium in a solubilized state, almost 100 at a pH value of 7 or 8. Although cpp is decomposed to a certain extent by digestive enzymes when taken in orally, a considerable amount of it is maintained intact and, as a result, calcium is kept almost completely solubilized. Solubilization of calcium by cpp will be shown by the following Experiments.Experiment 1 Calcium solubilizing activity was determined by using cpp obtained by the hereafter described Preparation 2. 0.5 ml of a 5 mg ml cpp solution and 0.5 ml of a 10 mM aqueous calcium chloride solution were mixed, and 1.0 ml of a 20 mM phosphate buffer solution, adjusted to a pH value of 7 or 8, was added, then the whole mixture was maintained at 250C for 6 hours. At the end of the period, calcium phosphate precipitate was eliminated by centrifugation, then 0.1 N hydrochloric acid was added to the supernatant to prevent further formation of precipitate. The calcium concentration in the supernatant was measured by atomic absorption analysis to determine the remaining solubilized calcium. A similar test was conducted as a control, but using distilled water in place of cpp solution.The results are shown in Table 2.

Experiment 2 1 ml of a 50 mg ml cpp solution obtained byPreparation 2 was mixed with 9 ml of an artificial gastric or enteric juice according to Japanese Pharmacopoeia, 7th revised edition , then the mixture was maintained at 400C for 2 hours or 6 hours, respectively. After the treatment, pepsin and pancreatin in the juices were deactivated with boiling water. After centrifugation of the mixture, cpp remaining in the supernatant was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography to determine the remaining rate. The calcium solubilizing activity was also measured by using 0.5 ml of cpp remaining in the supernatant in a procedure similar to that in Experiment 1 at a pH value of 8.

This was purified by chromatography throughSephadex G 25, DEAE Sephadex A 25 and Biogel P 6.

The contents in the small intestine were washed and collected by a physiological saline solution then fractionated to soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation. The content of iron in respective fractions were measured by atomic absorption analysis.The results are shown in Table 5.

Use of cpp is quite advantageous as compared with oral intake of casein, which undergoes a further enzymatic degradation in the body and tends to lose the calcium solubilizing activity Y. S. Lee et al.,Ibid. . Further, for in vivo formation of cpp with milk casein, a large intake of milk is necessary, whereas cpp according to the present invention may be used in a smaller amount to obtain satisfactory results and therefore, may be added to diverse kinds of food and drink. The food and drink according to the invention may include, for example, confectionary such as tablet sweets and biscuits and drink such as lactic acidcontaining beverages . cpp may be added either to raw materials or to final products directly. There is no limit to the amount of cpp to be added to the foodstuff, as it has no bitter taste or odor peculiar to casein and has no toxicity to humans.However, in view of various factors such as cost, it is preferably added, in the case of confectionaries such as tablet sweets and biscuits, in an amount of 1 30 to the raw materials and, in the case of beverages, in an amount of 0.5 6 to the final product. The present invention relating to food and drink, to which cpp is added, is explained in the followingExamples.Example 1 A mixture of 910 g of powdered sugar, 40 g of calcium carbonate, 30 g of cpp produced by Preparation 1, 10 g of a sugar ester and 5 g of hardened soybean oil was mixed in a two shaft mixer, to which 5 g of an aqueous solution of gelatin was gradually added, then the whole mixture was thoroughly blended at 50 700C. After completion of blending, the mixture was passed through a sieve, dried, and then a perfume was added.The mixture was blended again, then punched to give a tablet sweet.Example 2 A dough was prepared from 1,200 g of flour, 340 g of sugar, 150 g of margarine, 20 g of whole egg powder, 9 g of salt, 30 g of calcium carbonate, 20 g of cpp produced by Preparation 2, 6 g of sodium bicarbonate, 5 g of ammonium carbonate, 6.3 g of soybean lecithin, 5 g of vanilla oil and 250 g of water. This was extended, shaped and baked to produce a biscuit.Example 3 600 g of sugar and 200 g of prune extract were dissolved in water, and the mixture was boiled down.16 g of pectin that had been previously dissolved were added, and the mixture was thoroughly blended and further boiled down. A solution of 5 g of citric acid, 2 g of sodium citrate and 10 g of cpp produced byPreparation 3 was added to the mixture, and then the whole mixture was placed in a vessel and allowed to cool. The solidified mixture was cut into pieces, 10 g each, to give a prune jelly. Calcium and iron, contained in the food and drink obtained above, are maintained in a solubilized state by the chelating action of phosphoric group of phosphoserine and carboxy groups of acidic amino acids in the cpp. Thus, the calcium and iron are present in the small intestine in a high concentration and are able to be absorbed. The food and drink according to the present invention, therefore, increase absorption of calcium and iron in growing infants and children, and are good for the treatment of anemia in women, and bone diseases such as osteoporosis in aged people. They also have a healthy influence upon the metabolism of calcium and iron in the healthy humans. The best method to produce cpp, which is employed in the present invention as the calcium and iron absorption enhancing substance, is explained below. The method comprises contacting casein with trypsin or an enzyme preparation containing trypsin to give a hydrolysate solution containing cpp, adding to the solution calcium ions and a hydrophilic solvent, and recovering the thus prepared cpp. Alternatively, ferric ions may be added to the hydrolysate solution containing cpp to recover cpp. Still alternatively, the hydrolysate solution may be chromatographed through active carbon or an cation exchange resin to eliminate the bitter taste and recover cpp. The starting material or casein employed in the method is preferably in the form of acidic casein, sodium caseinate or calcium caseinate. However, milk or skimmed milk which are still impure, may also be used as the starting material. According to the method, casein, the starting material, is dissolved in water and then contacted with trypsin or an enzyme preparation containing trypsin. Trypsin or an enzyme preparation containing trypsin may be commercially available pancreatin, although a crystalline grade is more preferable in view of considerations such as yield. cpp may be produced by reacting the starting material, or casein, with an enzyme as mentioned above.From a practical point of view, concentration of casein should be between 2 30 d. The pH value should be from 6.0 to 9.0. The temperature at which the reaction is performed should be kept between 15 600C, preferably 20 500C. The weight ratio of enzyme to casein substrate should normally be 0.001 2 , when calculated as crystalline trypsin. They are contacted for from 5 minutes to 100 hours, during which the reaction will produce cpp. Recovery of cpp thus produced may be performed by the addition of a calcium salt such as calcium chloride or calcium acetate and a hydrophilic solvent to the reaction mixture. In the recovery step, the pH value should be maintained at or below 10, since elimination of phosphoric acid from cpp will occur at a higher pH value. Conversely, the reaction at a pH value of below 5.5 will give rise to formation of a precipitate, which must be removed before precipitation of cpp. The reaction at a pH value of below 3 will cause a simultaneous precipitation of cpp, hence it should be avoided. In summary, the reaction should preferably be performed at a pH value range of 3 10. Calcium is normally added in the range of 0.01 10 , within which no significant difference is observed. The hydrophilic solvent to be used for precipitation includes, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and acetone. It should be added to attain a final concentration of 30 80 v v . Where cpp is recovered by using iron, the iron should be in the form of ferric ion such as ferric chloride or ferric citrate. In this case, cpp can be recovered without using any organic solvent. Iron should be preferably added in the range of 0.01 1 , based on the reaction mixture. The temperature at which recovery of cpp is performed is not critical. Therefore, recovery may be performed at any temperature at which no boiling of the solvent takes place, although slightly higher yield can be obtained by keeping the temperature relatively low. Isolation of cpp precipitate thus obtained may be performed by conventional means, such as decantation, filtration or centrifugation. It may be further purified by washing it with a solvent employed for the recovery. The thus isolated cpp precipitate can be dried by conventional means such as by hot air, fluidized bed drying or vacuum drying to give a white to pale yellow powder having no odor and almost no taste. Where cpp is purified by column chromatography to remove its bitter taste, a hydrolysate solution of casein with trypsin is passed through a column containing activated carbon or a cation exchange resin.It is preferable to remove part of the impurities by isoelectric point sedimentation at pH 3 5.5, in advance of subjecting the hydrolysate to column chromatography. Upon chromatography, the hydrolysate is preferably passed through a column at a rate of 0.2 2.0 SV and at a concentration of 2 15 . By this method, 1.0 2.0 kg of the product calculated as the starting casein may be treated with about a 1 1 column. The purity of cpp thus obtained may be assayed through the determination of nitrogen content byKjeldahl method and of phosphorus content by Allen s method and modified Nakamura s method, then calculation of N P atomic ratio. The cpp obtained by the method of the invention has an N P atomic ratio of 7 20 It is almost free from the bitter taste which is peculiar to decomposition products of casein, hence may be used for food and drink as is. The cpp contains almost no aromatic amino acids, hence it shows almost no ultraviolet absorption assigned thereto e.g. 280 nm, 254 nm but only shows absorption assigned to peptide bonds 205 220 nm . The cpp may be alternatively assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography, using, for example,TSK GEL, G 2000 SW Tradename, Toyo Soda ManufacturingCo., Ltd. , eluted with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution p 6.5, containing 0.1 M sodium chloride . Detection of cpp may be performed by the measurement of ultraviolet absorption at 215 nm. According to assay by this method, it was confirmed that the cpp obtained by the process of the invention contains two types of cpp which are presumably originated from cpp and ss cpp and that the content of cpp is higher than 50 . Production of cpp according to the present invention will be explained by the following Preparations.Preparation 1 20 kg of sodium caseinate, produced in NewZealand, were dissolved in water to give a 20 aqueous solution having a pH value of 8.0. A crystalline porcine trypsin Novo, Denmark was added to the solution in an amount of 0.5 , based on the substrate, then the mixture was allowed to react at 500C at a pH value of 7.0 8.5 for 30 minutes. At the end of the period, the reaction mixture was immediately adjusted to a pH value of 4.5 to produce a white precipitate, which was removed by centrifugation. Calcium chloride and ethanol were added to the supernatant to final concentrations of 2.0 and 50 v v , respectively, then the mixture was stirred and allowed to stand overnight at ambient temperature. The supernatant was discarded by decantation and the cpp fraction was recovered with a basket type centrifugal machine. The precipitate was washed, in turn, with a 50 ethanol and then ethanol and dried by hot air, to give 3.4 kg of the cpp fraction. This contained 4.5 of water and the N P atomic ratio was 15.5. The purity, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was 80 .Preparation 2 0.5 of crystalline trypsin, based on the substrate, was added to a 2 solution of lactic casein pH 8.0 , and the mixture was allowed to react at 500C at a pH value of 7.0 8.5 for 30 minutes. At the end of the period, the reaction mixture was immediately adjusted to a pH value of 5 and the precipitate produced was removed. 0.1 of calcium acetate and 50 of ethanol were added to the supernatant to precipitate cpp, which was recovered by centrifugation and washed with ethanol to give the desired product.The N P atomic ratio of the cpp was 9.0 and it contained 3.5 of calcium. The purity, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was 90 or higher.Preparation 3 Crystalline trypsin was added to a 10 aqueous solution of lactic casein pH 8.0 in an amount of 0.01 , based on the substrate, then the mixture was allowed to react at 500C at a pH value of 7.8 8.2 for 6 hours. At the end of the period, the reaction mixture was adjusted to a pH value of 4.5, then the resulting precipitate was removed immediately. Ferric chloride was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 20 mM to precipitate cpp, which was recovered by centrifugation in a yield of 17.1 . The cpp had the N P atomic ratio of 13.0 and contained 3.5 of iron. The purity of cpp, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was 85 .Preparation 4 The supernatant containing 7.5 of the solid, obtained by isoelectric point sedimentation in Preparation 3, was passed through a column 3 cm o x 30 cm containing Dowex HCR W2 Tradename, 20 50 mesh, acid form at a rate of 0.5 SV. The eluate was fractionated every 200 ml. A bitter taste was detected after eluation of 2.4 1, at which the eluation was stopped and the whole eluate was recovered and lyophilized.The cpp, which was almost free from bitter taste and had a N P atomic ratio of 19.5, was recovered in a yield of nearly 100 . The purity of cpp, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was 50.3 .
