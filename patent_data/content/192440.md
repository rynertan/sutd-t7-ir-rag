# IMPROVED BONE FIXATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An external bone fixation system comprises two tubular members 38, 39 joined by an articulation block 40, 37 . Each pin carrier holds a bone fixation pin 17 for inserting into the bone, and the pin carriers are adapted so that two adjacent pins may be inserted into the bone with a minimum axial separation of no more than 1cm, and with a maximum included angle B of at least 30 .
