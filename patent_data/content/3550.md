# Process for converting leathery phosphazene polymer to elastomeric phosphazene polymer.

## Abstract
Leathery aryloxy polyphosphazenes are converted to useful elastomers by the presence of relatively low molecular weight oils in said polymers. The oils may be present as a result of the manner in which the polyaryloxyphosphazenes have been prepared or as an intentional addition to the phosphazene polymer.
