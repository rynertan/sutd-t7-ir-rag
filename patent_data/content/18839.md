## Description
C A D L S S The present invention relates to candles and to candle elements. It is an object of the invention to provide means enabling a large number of differently coloured decorative candles of various sizes to be produced, as desired, from a series of candle elements. From one aspect the invention provides a multi element candle in which the individual elements from which the candle is built up are not fused together. From another aspect the invention provides a candle comprising a plurality of superposed elements which are frictionally engaged one with another. Prefer ably the elements interfit one with another, in which case each element may have one end formed as a projection and its other end formed with a cavity, so that the shs ped end of one element can fit within the cavity in the abuting end of an adjacent element. With such a configuration, it is possible to construct a candle either with the projections uppermost, or alternatively with the cavities uppermost. From a further aspect the invention provides a candle structure comprising a plurality of apertured candle elements which are superposed one above the other around a central core element extending through said apertures. According to a feature of the invention, the candle element are not provided with individual wicks but are formed with a bore into which a separate wick is inserted when a plurality of the elements have been superposed one on the other to form a candle structure. From yet another aspect therefore the invention provides a candle structure comprising a plurality of similar superposed elements each of which has a separate bore, and a separate wick inserted through the aligned bores of the superposed element, wherein the structure is such that the wick can be replaced by inserting a new wick from either the lower end or the upper end of the candle structure. Alternatively each candle element may be provided with a wick and the ends of the wick at the opposite ends of the element are so formed that when two or more elements are superposed, a wick end on one element will lie adjacent the wick end of an abuting candle element thereby effectively forming a continuous wick structure through a candle comprising a plurality of superposed elements. According to a further feature of the invention the lower end of the wick or of each wick section is encased in a non inflammable material e.g. by crimping a metal tag about the lower end of the wick which serves to make the wick self extinguishing and also anchors the wick firmly in the unmelted wax. The invention also provides a candle element for forming a candle composed of a plurality of superposed elements wherein one end of each element is formed as a projection and the other end of each element is formed with a recess to receive the projecting end of an adjacent element. The invention will now be further described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which i ia,ure 1 is .a perspective view of one embodiment of candle element according to the present invention, Figure 2 is a section3 view through a candle made up of a plurality of the elements shown inFigure 1, Figure 3 is a sectional view through a further embodiment of candle structure, Figure 4 is a scrap view showing an alternative means of joining wick sections together, and Figure 5 is a somewhat diagrammatic sectional view of another embodiment of candle structure. Referring to Figure 1, a candle element comprises a generally cylindrical body 1 moulded from a suitable candle wax which is provided with n central bore 2 for receiving a wick. The upper end of the body is provided with a succession of sloping annular shoulders 3 forming a protruding male end, generally indicated at 4, and the lower end of the bod is provided with a recess 5 forming a female end which has a configuration so as generally to match the configuration of the protruding mal end. As shown in Figure 2, a plurality of such elements can be superposed to form a candle of any desired length or height with the protruding or male end 4 of one element fitting within the recess or female end 5 of the next adjacent element. The elements interlock with each other by means of tie shouldered configuration 3 and are held to getter by frictional interengagement of the interfitting portions. It will be appreciated that the configuration of the candle element shown in Figures 1 and 2 is only given by way of example ind that numerous other shapes of element may be made in order to form a candle structure of which the various elements interfit together in frictional engagement. The bores 2 of the various superposed elements are aligned to form a passage through tile candle to receive a wick 6 which is stiffened with wax so that it can readily be passed through the bore. It will be appreciated that the diameter of the bore 2 and the size of the wick 6 are chosen in relation to the diameter of the candle elements so as to provide satisfactory burning characteristics for the candle. Thus, the wick must be of sufficient diameter to be able to burn the wax forming the candle but must not be so large as to cause too rapid a rate of burning or flaring of the candle. The relationship between the diameter of the bore 2 and the size of the wick 6 is such as to allow the wick easily to be adjusted up and down within the bore but not large enough to allow any significant seepage of molten wax into the bore as the candle is burning. As shown1 the lower end of the wick is encased in a sheath 7 of non inflammable material, for example a piece of metal foil either wrapped round or crimped onto the wick. This non inflammable covering anchors the wick firmly in the unmelted wax and prevents the end from falling over and possibly out of the side of the candle if it is allowed to burn to the lower end of the wick. When the wick is finally consumed or largely consumed, the unburnt end including the noninflammable covering can readily be ejected by pushing up a succeeding wick 6a from underneath if the surrounding wax is still molten. Alternatively, the wick end can be pulled out from the top of the candle after the wax has hardened, and a succeeding. wick 6a pushed through h 1,he hose left by the enclosed end of the previous wick. A candle produced from R eries of elements as described possesses a number of advantageous features.Thus, the candle elements may be produced in a wide variety of different colours thereby enabling decorative candles to be produced incorporating elements of two or more different colours whereby an enormous range of different coloured decorative candles can be produced by a limited range of coloured elements e.g. 20 colours. Candles can also be built un to any desired height as required for a particular decorative or aesthetic effect and, moreover, can be maintained substantially at the desired height as they are burnt by adding successive candle elements at the bottom of a candle ac, the upper elements burn down and inserting a further wick through the bore of the candle from time to time as is necessary, and as is depicted in Figure 2. The facility of being able continuilly to replenish the candle as it is used up considerably reduces the wastage from unburnt ends, which is a common disadvantage with a decorative candle. Figure 3 slows a further embodiment in which the candle comprises a plurality of elements 11, here shown as two elements each incorporating their own wick 16. As can be seen, the upper end 16a of each wick projects from the upper surface of the candle element and is stiffened by virtue of the wax which it contains, whilst the lower end of the wick is encased in a sheath 17 of a non inflammable material as previously described and is located adjacent a recess 15 which reccives the upper end 16a of tlie wick of a lower candle element. Clearly the wick 16 is required to be located at the centre of the upper surface of the candle element and likewise the recess 15 must be located on the central axis of the candle section.To this end the wick is slightly inclined from the axis of the candle element so that its lower end lies adjacent to the recess 15. It can be seen that the upper end 16a of one wick overlaps the sheathed lower end of an adjacent wick, within the recess 15, when two candle sections are placed one on top of the other, with the two wicks in contact. Thus, as the upper candle element burns down the wick is gradually extinguished when it reaches the non inflammable sheath 17, but at this time the flame is transferred to the upper end 16a of the wick of the next lower element. As can be seen, the candle elements are of a different shape to that shown in Figures 1 and 2 and are illustrated as being of a generally plain cylindrical shape having a plateau 18 on the upper surface which engages in the corresponding shallow recess 15 in the lower surface of the next superposed element. It will be appreciated that the elements can take any convenient form and that instead of being circular they can be of multisided form bearing in mind the necessity for them to have a peripheral boundary in relation to the wick which is such as to ensure satisfactory burning of the overall wax sur 1 face at any time.It will also be appreciated that the 1 shape of the recess need not necessarily exactly correspond with the upper configuration of an adjacent canle element, provided that the two parts interfit toZecr in frictional engagement and that the transition of burning from one element to the next section occurs in a satisfactory manner. Figure 4 is a scrap vie of a further arrangement for joining together the wicks of two adjacent candle elements 21. In this embodiment the wicks 26 ex tend axially through each element and are intended to be joined with their adjacent ends in line and in abutting relationship.Thus, the ends of the wick are stiffened with wax and project respectively from above the upper surface 21a of an element and into the recess 25 at the lower end of an element. The lower entl of the wick is provided with a pin 22 such that as one element is placed upon the next adjacent element tie pin at the lower end of the upper element pierces into the upper end of the wick of the lower element and the two adjacent wick ends substantially abut. With this arrangement rIs the upper element burns down, the flame from the wick is transferred onto the upncr end of the next wick in the next lower element. Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of candle structure according to the invention in which the candle elements 31 are of a generally plain annular configuration and do not interfit one with another, but merely rest one upon tSle other. In this embodiment the elements are provided with a bore 32 of considerably larger diameter than that which is required to receive a wick and the aligned bores of the superposed elements accommodate a central cylndrical core candle structure 33 complete with a wick 36, but the wick is of such a diameter as to provide the correct burning characteristics for the overall diameter of the candle including the supernosed element 31.Preferably the candle elements 31 are a frictional sliding fit on te outer surface of te central candle structure 33. If desired, the central candle structure 33 may be provided with a bore to receive a separate wick instead of being formed wit1i a moulded in wick. According to a modification of any of te candle structures herein described, at least the base section or sections of a candle structure may be of a simulated non inflammable material which ie not intended to be burnt but merely to provide a decorative effect. However it will be appreciated that with such a structure, it is JJ readily possible to replenish the candle from the lower end in order to retain it at its desired height as it is burnt. The present invention enables an enormous variety of decorative candles to be built up of elements of different colours so as to provide a great variety of decorative candles of any desired height and, where desired, enables the height of the candles to be virtually permanently maintained by the replenishment of the candle with additional elements fitted at its lower end as it is burning. Where the candle incorporates a separate wick this may also be replenished without disturbing the candle structure, as described with reference to Figure 2.
