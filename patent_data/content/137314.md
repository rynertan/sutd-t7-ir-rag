# Vector quantizer for picture information.

## Abstract
A vector quantizer for quantlzing the vector of image and audio information, the vector quantizer being capable of efficiently encoding a compensation predictive error signal at a reduced bit rate by performing adaptive vector quantiza tion after judging the significance of the compensation predictive error signal in blocks, and capable of movement compensation inter frame vector encoding in which variable length encoding of movement vector is facilitated and information production control is achieved easily.
