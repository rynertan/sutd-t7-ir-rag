# Line protector for a communications circuit.

## Abstract
A line protector for central office use comprises an elongated housing 2 open at one side for receiving com ponents and a cover 30 for the opening 28 . First and second surge arresters 38 are coaxially positioned within the housing. First and second line terminals 58, 60 are respectively connected to the arresters as is a common ground terminal 62 . The three terminals project from one end of the housing in the provision of coplanar flat pins 68, 72, 80 for plugin connection with a circuit board edge con nector 108 . A test contact 90 in the housing permits use of a test probe to test the lines while the protector is plugged into the connector. A shiftable insulator 82 in the housing is used optionally to interrupt the inside lines at the line terminal pins 68, 72 .
