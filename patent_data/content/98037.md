# Electric power generation systems and methods of operating such systems.

## Abstract
In a coordinated control technique and arrangement for a steam power generating system, a megawatt error signal is developed 31, 32 a throttle or turbine pressure error signal is developed 21, 22 and the megawatt error and turbine pressure error signals are combined and used to control a throttle or turbine control valve 13 and fuel flow regulating means 19 to a boiler 10 .
