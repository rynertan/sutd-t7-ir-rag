## Description
BIS HYDROXYBEN7YL DERIVATIVES, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical composition containing same. The invention relates to bis hydroxybenzyl derivatives, to processes for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing same. More particularly the invention relates to compounds of the formula s EMI1.1 and salts thereof, in which R1 and R2 may be the.same or different groups selected from hydroxy, an etherified hydroxy and an esterified hydroxy group. The compounds of formula s I and IA possess anti inflammatory and lipid lowering activities and are potent immuno modulators with low toxicity.They enhance cell mediated immunity, stimulate the action of phagocytic cells and inhibit complement. They can generate a strong cell killing activity against foreign cells, such as cancercells. They are also useful for the control of pregnancy, as they can modify tolerance of foetal tissue. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by methods in actual use or described in the literature. For example, the compounds of formula I may be prepared in two steps fromEMI2.1 in which R1, is an etherified or esterified hydroxy group by reacting with a lithium compound such as lithium di isopropylamide, followed by reacting the lithium derivative thus obtained with the compoundEMI2.2 in which R2, is an etherified or esterified hydroxyl group and Hal represents haloqen, preferably chlorine or bromine. The free hydroxy compound of formula I R1 andR2 are hydroxy can be obtained by removing the hydroxy protecting group the ether.or ester moiety in the usual manner.For example, an alkyloxy group such as methoxy can be converted into the hydroxy group by the action of e.g. boronttibromide, and a trimethylsilyloxy, a tetrahydropyranyloxy or an acyloxy group can be converted into the hydroxy group under weakly acidic conditions. The preparation f the required starting material of formula I1 may be prepared as disclosed in tile attached flow sheet. Flow sheetEMI3.1 Compound II can also be used as starting product for a reaction with a substituted benzaldehyde under strong alkaline conditions, such as sodiummethoxide, sodiumamide or potassiumtert.butylate in an inert solvent, such as benzene or ether. The resulting compound of the general formula IV EMI4.1 in which R1, and R2 have the aforesaid meanings can be converted into the final product I by reduction of the double bond in a well known manner, preferably by catalytic hydrogenation, e.g. with palladium on carbon as catalyst. another convenient synthesis for the preparation of the compounds I consists of a reduction of an oxo group of a compound of the formula V EMI4.2 in which R1 and R2 have the aforesaid meanings. This reduction can be carried out by conventional means, for example with aluminum amalgam or sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide. The compound V can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI5.1 In aqueous weakly alkaline conditions the compounds of formula I are mainly present in open form, namely as compounds of the formula EMI6.1 in which R1 and R2 have the meanings assigned above. These compounds of formula IA as well as salts thereof are also considered part of the present invention. Obviously the compounds of formula IA can be obtained directly by using one of the aforesaid reaction methods but using aqueous alkaline conditions with respect to the isolation of the endproduct. The salts according to this invention are usually the alkaline metal salts pref. Na or ammonium salts. An etherified hydroxy group is usually a hydrocarbon oxy radical with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methoxy, ethoxy, allyloxy, propyloxy, isopropyloxy, butoxy etc., but also other ethermoieties are possible such as a trimethylsilyloxy and tetrahydropyranyl 2 oxy group. An esterified hydroxy group usually an acyloxy group, in which the acyl group is derived from an aliphatic carboxylic acid with 1 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. The compounds I and IA can occur in two diastereo isomeric forms cis trans and threo erythro respectively . Both diastereo isomers as well as the mixture thereof are compounds according to this invention. The aforesaid processes III and V I usually result in a mixture of the cis and trans isomer, whereby the trans isomer is the major product the process IV wI results in the cis isomer as the major product. If necessary the mixture of diastereo isomers can be separated in the usual manner by e.g. crystallisation, column chromatography, preparative thin layer chromatography, counter current distribution, etc. Moreover each cis and trans compound is a racemic mixture. The separate optical enantiomers also belong to the compounds of the invention.They may be isolated from the racemate in the usual manner, e.g. using an optically active base, or may be prepared starting from an optically active starting product. The compounds according to the invention can be processed to customary liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparations, for example to sugar coated pills, tablets, suppositories and solutions, also for injections. The customary excipients and diluents are used for this purpose. The oral single dose ranges from 0,01 100 mg kg body weight, the oral daily dose ranges from 0,03 to 300 mg kg bodyweight. The parenteral single dose ranges from 1 y to 10 mg kg body weight the daily dose is about the threefold quantity of this single dose. Ps anti inflammatory drug, the compound of the invention may also be incorporated in an ointment, gel or paste for local application.Preferably the drug is present in the ointment, gel or paste in an amount of 0,01 up to 2,5 of the total composition. Compounds which are recommended are compounds of formula I, in which R1 and R2 both represent hydroxy groups, substituted at the benzyl moieties in meta position. More particularly the trans isomer of the formula EMI8.1 is preferred.
