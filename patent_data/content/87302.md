## Description
GAS TURBINE ENGINE OPERATING METHOD AND APPARATUS THEREFOR This invention relates to improvements in methods and apparatus associated with the operation of gas turbine engines, particularly recuperated gas turbine engines. All known gas turbine engines suffer from high part load fuel consumption compared with reciprocating piston engines such as the diesel engine. Full load efficiencies equal to or better than the best piston engines can be achieved by gas turbine engines when equipped with exhaust heat exchangers regenerators to recover heat values normally wasted. The heat values are transferrec to the inlet air prior to combustion with the fuel.Such engine are commonly known as recuperated gas turbine engines and are especially suited for electric power generation applications. In such recuperated gas turbines it is of particular importance for achieving good part load efficiency to maintain the highest possible cycle temperature at lower output powers.This effect can be achieved by varying reducing the mass flow rate of air for combustion in addition to and or instead of varying the cycle temperature to vary load levels. The specific methods employed so far have relied upon vanes or other apparatus to partially block the air flow path to throttle the inlet air. These methods are inherently inefficient as they introduce aerodynamic losses which to a great extent offset the advantages. The gas turbine engine made according to the present invention achieves the enhanced part load efficiencies by reducing the inlet air flow at reduced engine loads and fuel flow rates, but without introducing the unacceptable aerodynamic losses associated with throttling methods and devices. The present invention also yields advantages in reduced start up times for gas turbine engines thereby increasing suitability for emergency standby power applications. In accordance with the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the method for controlling the mass flow rate of air to the combustor of a gas turbine engine for maintaining combustion temperature during reduced engine load conditions as close as possible to that at the maximum rated condition, the engine having an output shaft, a compressor having at least two independently rotatable stages, and a turbine, comprises compressing air in a first compressor stage operating at a first pressure ratio, said compressing step including the sub steps of sensing engine load, directly varying the rotational speed of said first compressor stage as a function of the sensed load further compressing the air in a second compressor stage operating at a second pressure ratio and admitting the further compressed air to the combustor. Preferably, the method is utilized for increasing efficiency of a recuperated gas turbine engine during reduced load operation, the engine also having heat exchanger means for transferring heat values from the expanded combustion gases exiting the turbine to the compressed air entering the combustor, and further includes means for decreasing fuel flow to the combustor during reduced load operation, wherein the main flow varying step includes the step of adjusting the air mass flow rate to the combustor in accordance with the reduced fuel flow to maintain combustion gas temperatures at near rated condition, and wherein the substeps are accomplished by differentially coupling the output shaft to the shaft of the low pressure compressor stage and the turbine shaft. Further in accordance with the present invention, the apparatus for controlling the mass flow rate of air in a gas turbine engine for improved performance during reduced load operation, the engine having a combustor, a turbine including a turbine shaft, and a power output shaft, comprises a rotary compressor having at least two stages including a low pressure stage for compressing air received from the ambient, and a high pressure stage for further compressing the compressed air received from the low pressure stage and delivering the further compressed air to the combustor, each of the low and high pressure stages having an independently rotatable shaft differential coupling means for operatively connecting the shafts of the turbine and the low pressure compressor stage with the output shaft, the differential coupling means providing for a simultaneous reduction in rotational speed of the low pressure compressor stage with a reduction in power supplied by the output shaft and override means associated with the differential coupling means and operatively connected between the output shaft and the low pressure compressor stage shaft for limiting the reduction in rotational speed of the low pressure compressor stage to a preselected value. PrEt Terably, the override means includes a sprag clutch, and also includes transmission means for smoothly and selectively adjusting the differential speed relationship between the output shaft and said low pressure compressor stage shaft for optimizing the aerodynamic matching of said low and said high pressure compressor stages during full load operation. It is further preferred that the differential coupling means also operatively connect the high pressure compressor shaft to the low pressure compressor shaft and the output shaft, the apparatus further including means for preferentially accelerating the low pressure compressor stage shaft relative to the high pressure stage shaft during start up from essentially zero speed, zero load conditions. And it is still further preferred that the preferential accelerating means includes engine starting means operatively connected to the low pressure compressor shaft for rotationally accelerating the low pressure compressor shaft, and brake means operatively connected to the output shaft for preventing rotation thereof until the brake means is disengaged, and wherein the differential coupling means includes planetary gear means having preselected gear ratios such that the angular speed of the low pressure compressor stage is greater than that of the high pressure compressor stage when the output shaft is constrained from rotating. The invention will now be described in more detail, solely by way of example, with referencetothe accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 is a schematic representation of a recuperated radial flow gas turbine engine made in accordance with the present invention Fig 2 is a graph showing the expected qualitative comparison of the performance of the gas turbine engine depicted in Fig 1 relative to other power producing engines Fig 3 is a graph showing qualitatively the expected speed versus load relationship of the engine depicted in Fig 1 and Fig 4 is a graph showing qualitatively the expected speed of various components of the engine depicted in Fig 1 during start up. A recuperated radial gas turbine engine 10 embodying the present invention is shown in Fig 1 and includes a radial turbine 12 connected to a turbine shaft 46, a combustor 16 with associated ducting 18 for feeding combustion gases to the turbine 12, and a compressor unit 20. Compressed air exits compressor unit 20 and is fed to combustor 16 through ducting 22 after passing through a regenerator 24. The turbine exhaust is fed through the regenerator 24 along ducting 26 to provide recoverable heat values for transfer to the compressed air. Power generated in the turbine 12 by the expansion of hot combustion gases is ultimately delivered via turbine shaft 46 to an engine output shaft 28. The use of radiai type turbine 12 is not to be construed as a limitation on the present invention but merely illustrative. The present invention can be utilized with axial turbine stages and mixed axial radial machines. In accordance with the present invention, the apparatus for controlling the main flow rate of air in gas turbine engines during reduced load generation includes at least two series connected compressor stages capable of independent rotation. As embodied herein, the compressor unit 20 includes a low pressure stage 30 and a high pressure stage 32. Low pressure stage.30 is depicted as a dual entry single exit centrifugal type compressor having axially directed inlets 34, 36 and a radially directed exit 38. High pressure stage 32, which also is shown as a centrifugal type compressor, receives air compressed from low pressure stage 30 through an inlet 40 via a duct 42 and delivers the additionally compressed air from an exit 41 to the duct 22.Again, the use of a centrifugal type compressor, including a multiple entry single exit configuration, is merely illustrative of the invention and not to be construed as limiting the invention. Importantly, and as further described herein, the low pressure compressor stage 30 is mounted for rotation on a shaft 44 while the high pressure compressor stage 32 is mounted for rotation on a separate shaft. When the high pressure compressor stage is designed to rotate at the same speed as the turbine, the high pressure compressor stage 32 can be directly coupled to the turbine shaft 46 as in the embodiment shown inFig 1. The low pressure compressor stage shaft 44 is hollow and sized for running clearance with the shaft 46 affording the required independent rotation. Other mechanical arrangements and placements for the shafts 46 and 44 are possible and are considered to be within the scope of the invention. Further in accordance with the present invention, there is provided differential coupling means for operatively connecting the shaft of the turbine, the low pressure compressor stage, and the output shaft. As embodied herein, the differential coupling means includes an epicyclic planetary gear assembly 50 which, inFig 1, is depicted as having four stages designated generally 52, 54, 56 and 58, respectively. Stage 52 has a sun gear 60, a ring gear 62, and a pair of planetary gears 62a, and 62b operatively connected to a gear carrier 66. Stage 54 has a sun gear 70, a ring gear 72, and a planetary gear pair 74a and 74b operatively connected to a gear carrier 76. And stage 58 has a sun gear 80, a ring gear 82, and a planetary gear pair 84a and 84b operatively connected to the carrier 66. As can be appreciated from Fig 1, stages 52 and 54 are series connected, stage 54 serving as a speed reduction stage, with ring gear 72 being fixed. Thus, the engine output shaft 28, directly coupled to gear stage 54, is indirectly coupled to the ring gear 62 of stage 52. Further, it can be seen that low pressure compressor stage shaft 44, which is directly coupled to the sun gear 80 of stage 58, is also indirectly coupled to the planetary gears 64a and 64b of stage 52 via planetary gears 84a, 84b and common carrier 66. However, the angular velocity relationship between the carrier 66 and the sun gear 80 and thus shaft 44 is not fixed due to the presence of stage 56 which will be explained henceforth. And finally, the sun gear 60 is directly connected to the shaft 46 for the turbine and the high pressure compressor stage. It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that because the engine output 6haft 28, the turbine shaft 46 and low pressure compressor shaft 44 are each coupled to different stages of the planetary gear assembly 50, the shaft 46 being coupled to the stage 52 and the shaft 44 being coupled to the stage 58, the angular speeds of the respective machinery components are differentially related, according to well understood mathematical formulas. Engine 10 depicted in Fig 1 and made according to the present invention is primarily a constant output shaft speed machine, but with varying speeds for the two rotors of compressor stages 30 and 32. The actual angular speeds of the low pressure and high pressure compressors can be the same or different at the full load condition depending on the arrangements and geometries selected for differential gear assembly 50. It could be an advantage to run the low pressure compressor stage 30 at a lower speed as is shown in the embodiment in Fig 1 so that the specific speeds of the two compressor rotors could be optimally matched to each other and to the turbine rotor at full load conditions.Also, the high pressure compressor stage 32 need not run at the same speed as the turbine 12 although a same speed configuration is shown in Fig 1. When load and hence opposing torque is reduced at the essentially constant speed output shaft 28, the low pressure compressor stage 30 will automatically adjust its speed downwards to a degree determined by the geometric ratios utilized in the gear assembly 50. The speed of the high pressure stage 32 will also vary but to a degree much less than the low pressure stage 30.It is desirable to size the high pressure compressor stage 32 to operate at a higher value of pressure ratio during part load conditions than at full load for reasons that will become apparent from the succeeding discussion. A more detailed description of the planetary action employed is described below As load drops while the shaft speed is kept constant the torque applied to the low pressure compressor stage 30 drops pro rata.Therefore, its angular speed drops in accordance with an appropriate law EMI7.1 NotationsN RPM Revolutions Per Minute P PowerSubscripts c1 low pressure compressor C2 high pressure compressor o output Gear assembly 50 thus determines for a given power output at shaft 28 the speed of Ncl and Nc2 with the Pcl Po as aparameter,Ncl and Nc2 being the speeds of the shafts 44 and 46 respectively. As the output falls the speed of both Ncl and Nc2 is reduced as a function of the load and there is only one turbine inlet temperature that both satisfies the aerodynamic matching of the turbine and the speed power relation of the gear assembly 50. It is contemplated that an engine fuel control 90 will monitor output torque at constant output shaft 28 speed at various loads and correspondingly vary the fuel inputted to combustor 16 through a fuel line 92. The reduction in fuel flow to combustor 16 during reduced load operation must be balanced by a reduced air flow from compressor section 20 in order to maintain a high temperature at the inlet 18 of the turbine 12.This temperature generally will be approximately that at rated conditions, and control and maintenance of this temperature is of the utmost importance in achieving high operating efficiencies in regenerated gas turbine engines. The temperature and pressure ratio over the cycle ideally will be varied in such a way as to maintain approximately the same head coefficientEMI8.1 where d H. in isentropic change in enthalpy isen and U T is the angular speed of the turbine, thus maintaining an optimum operating condition for the turbine component even at reduced loads. For the present invention the head coefficient will range between about 0.98 to about 1.13. The compressor characteristics of the two compressors 30 and 32 can be optimized for the cycle since the low pressure and high pressure compressors 30 and 32, respectively, need not run at the same angular speed at maximum load. For a typical regenerated engine, the cycle pressure ratio would be selected between about 4 1 and 12 1. Dividing this pressure ratio over two stages would also provide wide operating characteristics for the compressor portion 20 and give excellent component efficiency. Engines such as 10 made according to the present invention can achieve a far greater reduction in air mass flow than with current methods. The rate of mass flow reduction will, according to the invention, approximately follow the reduction in power to below 50 power. The resulting engine performance, both full load and part load, should give an essentially constant specific fuel consumption s.f.c. down to below 50 power thus closely and advantageously matching the characteristics of a diesel efficiency curve as is shown qualitatively in Fig 2. As a consequence of the mathematical relation governing an unaltered epicyclic planetary gear train, the angular speed of the low pressure compressor stage 30 could become unacceptably low during very low load conditions, resulting in a net flow restriction in the compressed air flow path to the combustor 16 and possibly causing other operational problems such as high idle fuel flow and delays in subsequent return to high load conditions. The present invention is also intended to overcome this problem. Further in accordance with the present invention, override means are provided for limiting the reduction in rotational speed of the low pressure compressor stage 30. As embodied in the example shown in Fig 1, the override means 100 includes a sprag clutch 102 operatively connected between the output shaft 28 and the low pressure compressor stage shaft 44, the sprag clutch 102 being mounted between a shaft section 104a and a gear 130, which engages the carrier 66 of planetary stage 58 through an idler gear 106. Shaft section 104a is coupled via a gear 110 to the carrier 76 of stage 54 of gear assembly 50 and thus to output shaft 28. A sprag clutch is a commonly available one way device which only allows the transfer of torque in one direction. A ratchet wheel isa crude variant of this principle. Here, eccentric bodies not shown are placed in a ball bearing like fashion. Fig 3 presents qualitatively the speed relationship that should be achievable among the output shaft 28, the high pressure compressor shaft 46, and the low pressure compressor shaft 44 as a result of the override means 100. The override means also includes means for selectively and continuously adjusting the angular speed relationship between thigh pressure compressor stage sleeve shaft 46 and low pressure compressor stage shaft 44. As embodied herein, a variable speed transmission means 108 is operatively connected between the shaft section l04a and a shaft section l04b. Shaft section 104b, in turn, is coupled to the carrier 112 of stage 56 which, in turn, is operatively connected to two planetary gears 114a and 114b engaging the associated ring gear 116 and sun gear 118.As sun gear 118 of stage 58 is directly connected to ring gear 82 and thus indirectly to the low pressure compressor shaft 44 , the differential speed relationship of the shaft 44 to the output shaft 28, and indirectly to the high pressure stage shaft 46, can be varied by the variable speed transmission means 108. Hence, the present configuration enables optimization of the aerodynamic matching between the two compressor stages 30 and 32. Transmission means 108 may consist of an hydraulic torque converter having two series connected parts, a hydrostatic variable strokeconstant speed component 120 and a hydrostatic fixed strokevariable speed component 122. Using this arrangement, the relative rotational speeds of shaft 44 and shaft 46 can be smoothly controlled. Other means are available to control the relative rotational speeds of shaft 44 and shaft 46 and these are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. Apparatus suitable for components 120 and 122 are known to those skilled in the rotating machinery art. For example, constant speed variable stroke pump motors are available through Andersen fdegaard A.S.of Fyrstikkalleen, Oslo, Norway. The configuration shown in Fig 1 for override means 100 is particularly advantageous because it can be used in conjunction with engine start up apparatus made in accordance with the present invention, as will be discussed hereinafter. Further in accordance with the present invention, means are provided to preferentially accelerate the low pressure compressor stage shaft during start up. This will ensure flow in the correct direction through the engine 10 during this phase of operation. If the low pressure compressor 30 should be stationary at start or lag the high pressure compressor 32 and or the turbine 12, then the higher diameter radial turbine 12 could act as a compressor during the initial start up phase and result in unacceptable reverse flow through the engine lo, preventing start up. As embodied herein in the example shown in Fig 1, preferential accelerating means includes engine brake means such as a brake 124 operatively connected to the output shaft 28 via the shaft section 104a and gears 110 and 76, and engine starting means including a starter 126 operatively connected to the low pressure compressor stage shaft 44 via a sprag clutch 132, a gear 128, the gear 130, the idle gear 106, carrier 66, etc. Because the brake 124 is mounted on shaft section 104a, the sprag clutch 102 also permits relative motion between gear 130 and shaft section 104a during the start up phase. One of ordinary skill would immediately appreciate that other arrangements are possible to operatively connect the brake 124 and starter 126 to the engine 10 through the override means 100. The intended starting sequence for the engine lo is as follows, and the speeds of the various components are qualitatively depicted in Fig 4 as a function of normalized start up time Starter 126 engages sprag clutch 132 and drives the low pressure compressor shaft 44 via gears 128 and 130 and the planetary gear stage 58. Output shaft 28 is held still by brake 124 during this phase. Sprag clutch 102 allows the shaft section 104a to be at stand still. When output shaft 28 is at standstill, turbine shaft 46 will rotate with a lower speed than low pressure compressor shaft 44 as a result of the selected gear ratios. At a preselected speed of low pressure compressor shaft 44, the brake 124 is released and the output shaft 28, high pressure compressor and turbine shaft 46, and low pressure compressor shaft 44 will thereafter rotate at speeds according to the torque split between the three shafts, the torques being proportional to the rate of acceleration of the shafts. The shafts will continue to accelerate until they reach their respective design speeds at zero load. In the example shown in Fig 4. The design Speeds are N4 50 , N7 60 , N3 100 . The preferential acceleration means of the present invention thus enables relatively high rotational speeds to be achieved in low pressure compressor stage 30 during engine startup, in which case the low pressure compressor stage 30 acts to supercharge the high compressor stage 32 and thus provide shorter times to reach operational speeds. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations could be made in the gas turbine engine of the invention without departing from the scope of the invention.
