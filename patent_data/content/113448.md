# Fuel assembly skeleton compaction.

## Abstract
A fuel assembly skeleton compaction system which provides a means for remotely dismantling an irradiated nuclear fuel assembly skeleton once the nuclear fuel rods have been removed therefrom while the skeleton remains submerged in a coolant. The system comprises a feed chamber 28 for holding the spent fuel assembly skeleton and for feeding a spent fuel assembly skeleton into a shear chamber 24 which is arranged near the feed chamber 28 . The shear chamber 24 contains a shearing device 40 for shearing the skeleton into small pieces and for moving the pieces of the skeleton into a compaction chamber 26 which is located adjacent to the shear chamber 24 . The compac tion chamber 26 contains a compaction cylinder 36 for compacting the pieces of the skeleton introduced thereinto, A storage canister 30 is located below the compaction chamber 26 such that when a slide 76 of the compaction chamber 26 is opened, the compacted pieces of the skeleton may be pushed into the storage canister 30 . When the storage canister 30 is filled, it may be remotely removed and replaced with an empty canister 30 .
