# Hydraulic control system comprising a pilot operated check valve.

## Abstract
A hydraulic control system comprising a hydraulic actuator having opposed openings adapted to alternately function as inlet and outlets for moving the element of the actuator in opposite directions, a pump for supplying fluid to the actuator, pilot operated meter in valve means to which the fluid from the pump is supplied for controlling the direction of movement of the actuator, meter out valve means associated with each opening of the actuator for controlling the flow out of said actuator, and a pilot operated check valve 100 operable for controlling flow from the meter in valve means to one end of the actuator and for preventing flow out the end of said actuator, the pilot operated check valve 100 being operable at a lower pilot pressure than the meter out valve means and including time delay means 112, 115a, 119 such that the valve 100 functions to prevent flow out of the actuator after a predetermined time delay from the time when pilot pressure to said meter out valve means is interrupted, ensuring relief valve protection.
