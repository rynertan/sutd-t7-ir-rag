# A micro displacement measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
A micro displacement measuring apparatus using a semiconductor laser, comprises a compound resonator system 10 containing said semiconductor laser 1 , and a light detector 11 capable of receiving light from said semiconductor laser, the compound resonator system being constructed in a manner such that light from said laser irradiates an object 4 to be measured and the reflected light therefrom returns to the semiconductor laser.
