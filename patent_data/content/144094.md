# Nitrogen oxides decreasing combustion method.

## Abstract
A nitrogen oxides decreasing combustion method which comprises a first step of mixing a fuel and air with each other a second step of bringing the mixture obtained in the the first step, into contact with a packed catalyst so as to cause a portion of the mixture to burn only through a catalytic reaction and a third step of adding a fresh supply of the fuel to a stream obtained from the second step to form a mixed gas and causing the mixed gas to undergo non catalytic thermal combustion the temperature of said pack ed catalyst being lower than the ignition temperature of the mixture and the adiabatic flame temperature of said mixed gas being lower than a temperature at which the nitrogen oxides occur.
