Specifically Preferred for reasons of their highest herbicidal activity, greatest plant growth regulant activity and or most favorable ease of synthesis are N 4 ethoxy 6 methylamino 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl 3,4 dihy ro 3 methyl 1 oxo 1H 2 benzopyran 8 sulfonamide, m.p. 223 224 C d and N 4 ethoxy 6 methylamino 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl 3,4 dihy ro 1 oxo 1H 2 benzopyran 8 sulfonamide, m.p. 220 225 C d . The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 1, 2 and 3.Preferred reaction conditions are given by way of illustration. As shown in Equation 1, compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylisocyanate of Formula II with an appropriate heter ocyclic amine of Formula III, where R₁ H or CH₃ and R₂ H, F, Cl, or CH₃. The reaction is carried out at 25 to 100 C in an inert, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or acetonitrile for 0.5 to 24 hours as taught in U.S. Patent 4,127,405. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylcarbamate of Formula IV with an appropriate amine of Formula III, as shown in Equation 2. JSO₂NHCO₂Ph The reaction is carried out at 50 to 100 C in a solvent such as dioxane for 0.5 to 24 hours as taught in EPO Publication No. 44,807. The required carbamates IV are prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonamides V with diphenylcarbonate in the presence of a strong base. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I may be prepared as shown in Equation 3, by the reaction of a sulfonamide V with the appropriate carbamate heterocycle, VII. where A and J are as defined in Equation 1. The reaction of Equation 3 is best carried out according to the methods taught in EPO Publication No. 70,804. The intermediate sulfonylisocyanates of Formula II can be prepared by the two step procedure shown below in Equation 4, starting from the appropriate sulfonamides, V. The reactions of Equation 4a and 4b are best carried out according to the procedure of Ulrich, et al. as described in The sulfonyl isocyanates II can also be prepared from the sulfonamides V by a two step procedure involving a reacting the sulfonamides with n butyl isocyanate in the presence of a base such as K₂CO₃. at reflux in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone or acetonitrile, forming a n butyl sulfonylurea and b reacting this compound with phosgene and a tertiary amine catalyst at reflux in xylene solvent. This method is similar to a procedure taught by Ulrich and Sayigh, The sulfonamides of Formula V may be prepared as shown in Equation 5. where J is as defined in Equation 1 R₁ is H or CH₃ R₂ is H, CH₃, F or Cl R₃ is CH₂CH₃ or CH₂CH₂CH₃. The reaction of Equation 5a, in which lithiated benzamides are alkylated with disulfides to provide the corresponding sulfides, such as IX, is most convenientl y carried out by the procedures described by J. J. Fitt and H. W. Gschwend, Reaction of lithiated benzamides of Formula IX with propylene oxide to provide the corresponding alcohols X, as shown in Equation 5b, can be accomplished according to the method taught by N. S. Narashimhan and B. H. Bhide, The hydrolysis and cyclization of alcohol amides, such as X, to the corresponding benzopyrans XII, as shown in Equations 5c and 5d, is also taught by N. S. Narashimhan and B. H. Bhide, The reaction of Equation 5f, the oxidative chlorination of sulfides, such as XII, to provide the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides XIII, is carried out by the addition of molecular chlorine or a chlorine equivalent to the sulfide in the presence of water at 15 to 80 C in an aliphatic carboxylic acid solvent such as acetic acid or in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane for 1 to 24 hours. As shown in Equation 5f, sulfonamides of Formula V can be prepared from the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XIII by contacting with either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia. The preparation of sulfonamides from sulfonyl chlorides is widely reported in the literature, for reviews see F. Hawking and J. S. Lawrence, The Sulfonamides , H. D. Lewis and Co., London, 1950 and E. H. Northey, The Sulfonamides and Allied Compounds , Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York 1948. Some of the sulfides of Formula IX are more conveniently prepared by the displacement of chlorine from the ortho chloro substituted benzamides XIV with the salt of an alkyl mercaptan as shown in Equation 6.. where M Na or KR₂ and R₃ are as defined in Equation 5. The reaction of Equation 6 can be carried out at 25 to 80 C in a polar solvent such as N,N dimethyl formamide. The displacement of halides by the metal salts of mercaptans is well known in the literature, see J. R. Campbell, The aminotriazine III is known in the art.

Usi ng the methods described herein and the procedures of Examples 1 to 5, the compounds of Table I may be prepared. Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning. Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H. M. Loux, U.S. Patent 3,235,361, February 15, 1966, Col. 6, line 16 through Col. 7, line 19 and Examples 10 through 41 R. W.

The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammermill to produce particles with an average particle size of less than 25 microns in diameter. The material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.33 mm opening before being packaged. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. The liquid surfactant is added by spraying upon the solid ingredients in the blender. After grinding in a hammermill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The ingredients are blended in a rotating mixer and water sprayed on to accomplish granulation. When most of the material has reached the desired range of 1.0 to 0.42 mm U.S.S. No. 18 to 40 sieves , the granules are removed, dried, and screened. Oversize material is crushed to produce additional material in the desired range. These granules contain 12 active ingredient. The ingredients are blended, hammermilled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are thoroughly blended, passed through an air mill, to produce an average particle size under 15 microns, reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening before packaging. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 3 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammermilled and then air milled to produce particles of active essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammermill to produce a high strength concentrate essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm openings . This material may then be formulated in a variety of ways. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are ground together in a ball or roller mill until the solid particles have been reduced to diameters under 10 microns. The compounds are selective herbicides for use in oilseed rape The compounds of this invention may be used in combination with other commercial herbicides. They are particularly useful in combination with the following herbicides The selective herbicidal properties of the subject compounds that make them useful as rape herbicides were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests, conducted as described below. Seeds of the following crops and weed species were sown into 15 cm diameter pots containing Sassafras sandy loam soil wheat Results are summarized in Table 1. Data represent the results of two tests. Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5 cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was planted with blackgrass Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5 cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was pla nted with blackgrass, sugarbeets, nutsedge, rape, crabgrass, sicklepod, teaweed, jimsonweed, velvetleaf, and giant foxtail. The other pan was planted with wheat, cotton, rice, corn, soybeans, wild oats, cocklebur, morningglory, johnsongrass, and barnyardgrass. The two pans were sprayed pre emergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. Treated plants and controls were maintained in the greenhouse for 28 days, then all treated plants were compared to controls and visually rated for plant response. Response ratings are based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 no effect, and 100 complete control. A dash response means no test. Response ratings are contained in Table 2. Data are combined from two tests.
