# Enhanced reliability interrupt control apparatus.

## Abstract
Interrupt control apparatus in a data processing system for acknowledging on priority basis one among several possi ble asynchronous interruptions INT 1, INTN , such apparatus comprising a priority network 5 , a latching register 7 and a validation circuit 11, 12 . The priority network directly receives on its inputs the asynchronous interruption signals and provi des on its outputs a binary code corresponding to the most prioritary interruption present on its inputs. The interruption code is latched in the register and is present on the outputs of it. The code latched in the register is used by the validation circuit as selection code of the related input interrupting sig nal. If such last is present, the code is validated, that is it is transferred to the central unit of the system. If the selected interruption signal is not present, the code is not validated, that is it is neglected.
