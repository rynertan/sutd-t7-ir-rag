# Vaginal ring.

## Abstract
A vaginal ring comprises a supporting ring 1 free of active agent. A layer 2 , which contains an active agent such as a steroid, is applied on its outer rim, optionally in a continuous groove provided in the supporting ring. This layer, in turn, is coated with a layer 3 devoid of active ingredient. All components preferably comprise an LTV silicone elastomer. The ratio of the thickness of the layer 2 , containing an active agent, to the layer 3 , free of active agent, is about 5 50 1. As a result, a longterm and uniform release rate is achieved for the active agent.
