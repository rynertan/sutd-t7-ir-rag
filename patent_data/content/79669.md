# Optical type information read write apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical disk system is disclosed which comprises an optical disk 10 rotating in accordance with constant linear velocity CLV technique, a signal input device 16 for digitalizing at least one information unit included in informa tion in accordance with pulse code modulation PCM technique and for producing an information signal 18 digitally encoded, and address generator 20 for generating an address signal 22 , an interleave circuit 28 for interleav ing simultaneously both the information signal 18 and the address signal 22 , and a write controller 32 for modulating a write beam incident to the optical disk 10 in response to the output signal from the interleave circuit 28 and for forming at least one sector including both the signals on the optical disk 10 .
