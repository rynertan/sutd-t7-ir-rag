# Operator Interactive verification systems and methods.

## Abstract
Operator interactive verification of a card based transac tion involves reading a magnetic stripe 24 on the card C to derive test data T representing an arithmetical combination of a uniqueness characteristic of the card derived from its translucency at defined locations D1 D6 and the assigned user s personal identification data PIN . The test data T is arithmetically combined with the personal identification data PIN entered by the user, to produce a decoded representa tion of the uniqueness characteristic D which is compared with a fresh sensing D of that characteristic as a basis for verification of both the card C and the user entered data PIN . The user can choose to alter his operative personal identification data PIN , and does this, after first achieving verification using the exisiting data, by entering the new, chosen data for re calculation with the decoded uniqueness characteristic D to produce new test data T which is then recorded on the card C in place of the old T .
