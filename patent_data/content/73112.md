# Kit for converting a panel opening to a shielded pin receptacle.

## Abstract
A kit is disclosed for converting a standard connector opening 36 in a panel 14 or the like into a shielded pin receptacle. The kit includes a ground plane spring 10 and a shielded header shroud 12. The spring 12 is a planar metal member having spring fingers 20 on the outer periphery and a central opening conforming to the panel opening. A plurality of integral inwardly directed tines 24 surround the central opening and extend substantially normal to the spring 10. The shroud 12 is formed of insulative material with a cavity 28 profiled to receive both the tines 24 and a mating connector 16. An array of openings 30 in the bottom of the cavity permit insertion of pin terminals 60, 68 from a pin header 52, pin connector 56, or the like.
