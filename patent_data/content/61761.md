## Description
A Method for Preparing a Mononucleotide 3 phoSphodiester based Substrate BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to chrcmogenic and orfluorogenic mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters, and, more particularly, to a novel method for synthesizing such mononucleotide phosphodiesters. These materials may be used, for example, in carrying out various non isotopic immunoassays. 2. Description of the Prior Art For a variety of clinical purposes such as, for example, coniorig dosage schedules, monitoring hormone levels, checking for recent ingestion or following pharmacological dynamics o bioavailability, absorption, degradation or excre tion, it is a great advantage to measure the concentration or various drugs or the like to the nanomolar or even picomolar level. As is known, radoimmunoassay can acccmpllsh analyses of this type.To carry out an analysis, an acceptable kit cr system must include an antiserum, a standard of the compound i.e., analyte to be measured, the radiolabelec derivative of the compound to be measured, a buffering agent or agents and, often, a displacing agent. The antiserum is produced by bleeding animals which have been immunized by innoculation, for example, with the hapten protein conjugate mmunogen corresponding to the compound to be measured. As is well known, in general, the technique o ratio immunoassay measures the competition between radoactively labeled analyte and unlabeled analyte for binding sites on the antibody in the antiserum. 3y ad ng to the antiserum known amounts of the analytes to be assayed and a radiolabeled analog, a dose response curve for bound or free analyte versus concentration of analyte is constructed. After this immunocali oration has been carried out, unknown concentrations can the. be compared to the standard dose response curve for assay.Crucial to this type of assay is the existence of radioactive analytes which compete effectively with non radioactive analytes. Accordingly, in order to obtain the maximum precision, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility or the assay, purified, well characterized synthetic radioactive analytes are required. Several deficiencies in radioimmunoassay methodology have been identified. First of all, it is necessary to make a physical separation of the antibody bound radiolabeled analyte from the free radiolabeled analyte. Further, the methodology is considered rather labor intensive, and the equipment re quire is likewise relatively expensive, is not uniformly available, and further requires the use of highly trained and skilled technicians to accurately carry out such assays. Like wise, the raioisotopical y labelec analytes are relatively unstable and expensive and pose an increasingly severe waste disposal problem owing to radiat on exposure hazards associated wit the commonly used radioisotopic labels.Despite these short ccmincs, the use of radioimmunoassay has grown considerably. The substantial recent growth in the use of radio mmunoassay in clinical laboratories has, however, spurred the development of variants which overcome the deficiencies of the radiomunoassay methodology as described herein. the approaches which have been developed to overcome these deficiencies primarily involve the use of enzyme or fluorescent labels instead of radioisotopic labels, preferably coupled with conditions allowing for measuring a chemical distinction between bound and free fractions of labeled analyte which leachs to the elimination of the requirement for physical separation.Immunoassays having the latter simplifyng and advantageous feature are referred to as homogeneous ìimunoassays as opposed to heterogeneous immunoassays where physical separation is required. Thus, hcmogeneous immunoassay systems have been developed which are based on the use of an enzyme labeled analyte where the enzymatic activity of the label is decreased when complexation with the antibody occurs. Unlabeled analyte whose concentration is to be determined displaces the enzymelabeled analyte bound to the antibody, thus causing an increase in enzymatic activity.Standard displacement or dose response curves are constructed where increased enzytratic activity monitored s ectcphotcmet icL iy using what has been termed a nsubst 2te which ultitrately produces a unique chromophore as a consequence of enzyme action is plotted against increased analyte concentration. These are then used for determining unkncwn analyte concentrations. The following United States patents have been issued in the field of homogeneous enzyme immunoassay 3,817,837 3,852,157 3,875,011 3,966,556 3,905,871 4,065,354 4,043,872 4,040,907 4,039,385 4,046,636 4,067,774 4,191,613 and 4,171,244.In these patents, te label for the analyte is described as an enzyme having a molecular weight substantially greater than 5,000. Also, commercialization of this technology has been limited so far to applications where the analytes are relatively small in molecular size at fluid concentrations of the analyte greater than 10 10M. As a consequence of the limitations of the homogeneous enzyme immunoassay technique described above, consice able effort has been devoted towards developing more sensitive homogeneous immunoassays using fluorescence. These have been primarily directed at assays for the larger szeo molecules such as immunoglobulins or polypeptide hormones such as insulin. The following United States patents have been issued for this type of assay 3,998,943 3,996,345 4,174,384 4,161,515 4,208,479 and 4,160,016. The label in most of these patents involves an aromatic fluorescent molecule, bound either to the analyte or to the antibody.All likewise involve various methods of quenching fluorescence through antibodies or other fluorescent quenchers so that the extent of quenching is related to the amount of analyte present in the sample. A further type cf methodology which may be described as a reactant labeled fluorescent immunoassay involves the use of a fluorescent labeled analyte designed so that a fluorescent product is released when it is enzymatically hydrolzyed. Antibody to the analyte portion of the molecule, however, rz. bits enzymatic hydrolysis. Consequently, by the law cf mass action, fluorescence is enhanced in the presence of ncreased analyte due to enzymatic hydrolysis of the displaced, fluorescent labeled analyte. As an example, a labeled analyte is ss galactosyl umDelliferone sisomicin. The enzyme galactosicase cleaves the sugar from the umbelliferone moiety which can then fluoresce. Publications which describe this methodology include J.F. Burd, R.C. wrong, J.E. Feeney, R.J. Carrico and R.C. Boguolaski, Clin.Chem., 23, 1402 1977 Burd, Carrico, M.C. Fetter, et al.,Anal. Biochem., 77, 56 1977 and F. Then, Z. Hal lander and 3ocuolaski, Jour. of Steroid Biochem., 11, 161 1979 . The co pending U.S. Farina et al.application, USSiN 248,689, filed arch 30, 1981, provides methodology for carrying out non isotopic immunoassays which obviates the deficiencies of prior assays of this general type. . In an illustrative embodiment, this methodology utilizes a labeled analyte polypeptide complex which expresses ribonuclease type activity to catalytically convert a substrate to a chromogenic or fluorogenic reporter molecule. Many organic compounds have been utilized heretofore for monitoring the catalytic activity of ribonuclease. Such organic compounds, or substrates, as they are commonly referred to, include ribonucleic acid itself, cyclic phosphate diesters, and monoribonucleotide compounds which exhibit the same or similar structural constraints as those expressed by the natural substrate. Thus, for example, one method for monitoring the catalytic activity of ribonclease involves the use of z ribonucleic acid solution. That method involves monitoring a decrease in absorbance at 300 nm of a ribonucleic acid solution as a function of time, M. Runitz, J. Biol. Chem., 15 , 563 1946 . Although that method is relatively sinple to conduct, it has several deficiencies specifically, the rate of decrease of absorption is not linear, calibration of each substate solution is required, and direct monitoring of absorbance decreases at 300 nm is impractical with clinical samples. Another method utilized for monitoring ribonuclease activity is an end point variant of the procedure described above. In the end point variant procedure, yeast ribonucleic acid is incubated with the enzyme sample for a fixed period of time. The remalr.ing RNA is precipitated with perchloric acid or uranyl acetate trifluoroacetic acid, and the absorbance of the supernatant is measured after centrifugation. S.B. Anfinsen, R.R. Redfield, W.L. Chcate, A. Page, and t7.R. Carroll, Jcur. Biol. Chem., 207, 201 1954 . However, that method is much too cumbersome for homogeneous immunoassays of the type described in the co pending Farina et al. application primarily due to the precipitation step involved. Yet another variation of the above procedures has been reported by R.C. Kamm, A.G. Smith, and H. Lyons, Analvt. 3iochem., 37, 333 1970 . The method described therein is based on the formation of a fluorescent reaction product resulting from the reaction of the dye ethidium bromide with intact yeast ribonucleic acid, but not with the hydrolysis product. In that method, a fluorescent signal, which is monitored, decreases wit time.However, mcr. tcring a fluorescent signal which decreases with time is disadvantageous, as the method may result in a lack of sensitivity when only modest differences in enzyme concentration are encountered. n ad di ton, other disadvantages are that the rate of cecrease of absorption is not linear, and calibration of each substrate solution is required. Another known substrate for monitoring rionuclease activity is a mononucleotide substrate, cytidine 2 , 3 phos phate diester, E.M. Crook, A.P. MÅathias, and B.R. R2bin, 3ocnem. J., 74, 234 1960 .In that method, an increase of absorbance at 286 nm, corresponding to the hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate ring, is monitored over a two hour period to measure the ribonuclease activity of the sam le. This method, however, cannot be used in homogeneous immunoassay methods of above mentioned the type described in the Farina et al. copending application because there are analyte sample interferences which occur at 286 nm. Furthermore, the distinction between the substrate and product absorbance spectra is small, with the ratio o extinction coefficients being only 1.495 at 286 nm. Further, certain mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters, including, 1 naphthyl esters of 3 uridylic, 3 inosonic and 3 adenylic acids have been utilized as ribonuclease substrates.These napthyl esters have been used to differentiate substrate specificities of ribonucleases from various sources. H.Sierakowska, M. Zan Kowalczewska, and D. Shugar, Biochem.Biophvs. Res. Comm., 19, 138 1965 M. Zan Kowalczewska, A.Sierakowska, and D. Shugar, Acta. Biochem. Polon., 13, 237 1966 H. Sierakowska and D. Shugar, Acta. Biochem. Polon., 18, 143 1971 H. Sierakowska, a. Szemplinska, D. Shugar,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 11, 70 1963 .As a result of ribonuclease induced hydrolysis, the use of such substances results in the liberation of 1 naphthol which is allowed to react with a diazonium salt to orm an azo compound having strong visible absoriance. This approach requires that the assay kit include a separately packaged dye former viz. 2 diazonium salt . Also, this substrate cannot be employed in a fluorometric mode. Various syntheses have been developed heretofore for the preparation of mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters. One such method for the preparation of uridine 3 l naphthyl phosphate is that disclosed in R. Kole and E. Sierakowska, Acta Biochim. Polon, 18, 187 1971 . Zn accordance with the method shown therein, uridine is acetylated at the 3 hydrcxyl position EMI7.1 Next the 2 and 5 hydroxyl groups of 3 O acetvl uridine are blocked with dihydropyran and secuentially, the 3 O acetyl undergoes hydrolysis so that 2 , 5 bis O tetrahydropyranyl uridine is formed EMI8.1 Condensation of 2 , 5t bis o tetrahydropyranyl uridine with naphthyl phosphate dicyclohexylcarbodiimi8e or naphthyl phosphoryldichloride then results in l naphthyl phosphorylation of the 3 hydroxyl to form the blocked form of the substrate 2 , 5 di O tetrahydropyranyl uridine 3 l naphthyl phosphate EMI8.2 The tetrahydropyranyl blocking groups are acid labile and may be removed without competitive phosphate hydrolysis to form the substrate, uridine 3 l naphthyl phosphate EMI8.3 A variation of the synthesis described in Sierakowska and Shugar discussed above, is the method described in Rubs amen,Khandler and Witzel Hoppe Seyler s Z.Physiol.Chem., 355, 687 1974 . There, 2 , 5 bis O tetrahydropyranyl 3 uridine phosphate is prepared by te reaction of dihydropyran with uridine 3 phosphate. Dephosphorylation of the 2 , 5 bis O tetrahydropyranyl 3 uridine phosphate with, for example, phosphatase or lead II hydroxide, forms 2 , 5 di O tetrahydropyranyl uridine. The 3 hyÅaroxyl of that compound may then be phosphorylated in the fashion disclosed in Sierakowska and Shugar to form the desired mononucleotide 3 phosphodiester, such as, for example, uridine 3 naphthyl phosphate. The synthesis schemes described by Sierakowska et al., and Rubsamen et al., suffer, however, from several major deficiencies. For example, in each synthesis method, the preparation of the key intermect ate, 2 , 5 bis O tetrahy cropyranyl uridine, involves an undesirable, lengthy chromotagraphy. Further, the resulting product is a mixture of diastereomeric pairs in low yields and this camplicates subsequent synthetic steps. Finally, the overall synthesis is labor intensive. Closely similar schemes to those of Sierakowska et al. and Rubsamen et al. are disclosed in Polish PatentNo. 81969. In one synthesis described therein, uridine 2 , 5 di O tetrahydropyrano 3 1 naphthyl phosphate is formed in dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and pyridine by the reaction of a salt of 1 naphthylphosphoric acid, e.g., the pyr a ne, aniline, lutidine or tri n buytlamine salt of the acid with 2 , 5 di O tetrahydropyranyl uridine. In another synthesis described therein, uridine 2 O tetrahydropyranyl 5 O methyl 3 1 naphthyl phosphate is formed in pyridine by the reaction of a salt of 1 naphthylphosphoric acid and 5 O methyl 21 O tetrahydropyranyl uridine.These schemes likewise suffer from the deficiencies of the Sierakowska et al. and Rubsamen et al. methods. In addition, methods are known for preparing oligoribonucleotides which incorporate the synthesis of 2 , 5 diblocked nucleotides as intermediates. Thus, in J. Smrt and F. Sorm, Collection Czechoslov. Chew. Commun. 27, 73 1962 , uridylic acid is converted into 5 0 acetyluridine 2 , 3 cyclic phosphate which, after enzymatic cleavage of the cyclic phos phate by pancreatic ribonuclease, results in 5 0 acetyluri dine 3 phosphate, which is then transformed into 2 0 tet a hydropyranyl 5 0 acetyluridine 3 phosphate by the reaction with dihydropyran. In this method, acetylation at the 5 hydrcxyl of the cyclic phosphate is utilized as a synthetic convenience for preparing intermediates in the synthesis ow oligoribonucleotides. Deblocking of the 5 acetyl is ultimately carried out in the formation of the desired oligoribonucleotide.This, however, does not describe a suitable method for synthesizing a chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide 3 phosphodiester. Further, in K.K. Ogilvie, S.L. Beaucage, A.L.Schifman, N.Y. Theriault and K.L. Sadana, Can.J.Chem., 56 2768 1978 , 2 , 51 di t butyldimethylslyl blocked uridine and adenosine nuclecsides are prepared by the reaction of t butyl aimethylsilyl chloride in pyridine or imidazole with a uricine or adenosine nucleoside. The resulting silylated nucleosides are then coupled to one another by phosphorylation to form oligonucleotides. Moreover, insofar as is known, the Smrt et al. andOgilivie et al. methods have not heretofore been utilized in preparing such chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters, despite the deficiencies of prior methods. Thus, despite the considerable number of methods that have been developed and utilized for synthesizing various substrates suitable for use for monitoring enzymatic or catalytic activity, there remains the need for further devel opment which can overcome the various shortcomings of the presently known synthetic methods. None of the synthesis schemes described heretofore are currently being used commercially for the manufacture of mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters insofar as is known. It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a novel method for synthesizing mononucleotide 3 phosphowiesters having a chromogenic and or fluorogenic in the furanoside ring functional group at the 3 phosphate mciety in a more cirect manner involving fewer synthetic steps than required in prior methods. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel method for synthesiznng chromocen c and or fluorogenic for use in monitoring catalvtic or enamstic activity mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters, which is less labor inten sive than previous syntheses heretofore known. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel synthesis of chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide 3 ohosthodiesters which results in improved overall yields of desired substrate. Still another object is to provide a novel synthesis of chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide 3 nhosphod esters, which may be carried out on a multigram scale sufficient for commercial use. A further object of the present invention is to provide a product capable of being stored for extended periods of time and then, when needed, may be converted to an active form for use. These and other objects and advantages of the present inyention will become apparent from the following detailed description. While the invention is susceptible to various modi fications and alternative forms, there will herein be described in detail the preferred embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that it is not intended to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all modifications and alternative forms falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. For example, while the present invention will be primarily described in conjunction with the formation of a uridine 31 phosphodiester, it should be appreciated that bases other than uracil may be employed, as will be described herein. SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION In general, the present invention is predicted on the discovery that mononucleotide 3 phosphodiester substrates having a chromogenic and or fluorogenic functional group at the 3 phosphate moiety may be readily synthesized in as few as three steps by simultaneously blocking the 2 , 51 hydroxyls of a mononucleoside with a selected common blocking group ana thereafter csnveting the diblocked species to incorporate the desired chromogenic and or fluorogenic moiety at the 3 position.The resulting product is provided in a form capable of being stored for extended periods of time without adverse affects and may then be converted to a useful form by removing the blocking group at least at the 2 positon. The necessary synthetic steps may be accomplished in a variety of schemes, providing sufficient versatility to allow a synthesis tailored to the desired diester substrate. The resulting chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide 3 phosphodiester substrates may be utilized for monitoring the catalytic activity of a variety of enzymes, such as, for example, ribonuclease A, T2, and the like and or polypeptide pairs having the catalytic activity of such enzymes. The chromogenic and or fluorogenic mononucleotide substrates formed by the method of this invention are useful in the immunoassay methodology disclosed in the previously identified copending Farina et al. application. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODI.MVNmS In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, suitable starting materials comprise mononculeosides having the following structural formula EMI13.1 In this structure, there appear to be certain steric constraints which must be met n order to ultimately provide a substrate suitable for monitoring the catalytic activity of, for example, ribonuclease A induced hydrolysis.Thus, the trans, cis orientation of the base B and substituents at positicns 1 and 2 , 3 , respectively, appear to have rigid structural constraints to provide a suitable substrate. However, the substituents at the 4 postion, that is, CH2OH, may apparently have a configuration where the CH2OH group is cis to both the 2 and 3 functional groups, without affecting the desirable attributes of the substrate.A. Holy and F. Sorn, Biochemica. Blochvslca. Acta., 161, 26 1968 . Accordingly, while the method of the present invention will be described in conjunction with the preparation of a substrate wherein the 4 CH2OH substituent is trans to the 2 , 3 substituents, it should be appreciated that the method is likewise equally applicable to the preparation of a substrate wherein the 4 CH2OH substituent is cis to the 2 , 3 substituents. From the functional standpoint, the selection of the base should take into account the following factors, in addition to, of course, its effect on product stability 1 any modulation increase or decrease of catalytic activity, 2 the difficulty of synthesis, 3 the effect on endogenous enzymatic activity and 4 the solubility in aqueous or other medjuins of interest should not be adversely affected to any significant extent. Other factors to consider include possible effects on hydrolysis and non specific medium induced hydrolysis. A wide variety of pyrimictine analogs are useful bases, including uracil, dihydrouracil, cytcsine, dihydrocytosine and halogenated uracils. Additionally, base on data extrapolated from results on the ribonuclease incuced hydrolysis of both the natural substrate, RNA, as well as various synthetic substrates, such as, for example, nucleo be homopolymers, F.M. Richards and W.W. Wykoff in The Enzymes, P.D. Boyer, Ed. , Academic Press, 3d Edition, Volume 4, pages 647 806, London and New York 1978 , the following pyrimidine analogs should be suitable bases EMI15.1 While the use of purine analogs as bases, such as, for example, adenosine and guanosine, will not provide active substrates for monitoring the catalytic activity of ribonuclease A, these bases should prove useful when ribonuclease T2 activity is involved. Further, any other pyrimid ine, purine or the like analogs may be used consistent with the functional considerations set forth herein. In carrying out the first step of the method, the mononucleoside is reacted with a silylating reagent to form a 2 , 5 disilylblocked mononucleoside of the general formula EMI15.2 Suitable blocking groups R should meet the following criteria 1 readily introduced without affecting the other key functionalities, 2 compatible with the subsequent phosphodiester formation step, and more particularly, should minimize or eliminate undesired side reactions in such step, 3 sufficiently stable to allow long term storage without any adverse deleterious affects and 4 easily removed without disruption of the phosphodiester bond.These criteria are satisfied by various silyl derivatives including triisopropyl sill, tert butyltetramethylenesilyl and tert butyldimethyl silyl. The tert butyldimethyl silyl moiety is preferred. In carrying out the silylation step, the resulting products ccmprise, in addition to the desired 2 , 51 diblocked species, a series of isomers including the 3 , 5 2 , 3 , 5 and 2 , 3 diblocked specie. The principal isomers provided will typically be the desired 2 , 5 diblocked species and the 3 , 5 diblocked product. The product .mix ture obtained ill depend upon te particular process para meteors em loved, and selectivity to the desired species may be enhanced by appropriate selection of such process para meters.Regardless, the separation of the various isomers to provide the desire diblocked species is relatively simple e.g. carried out by straightforward known chromatographic methods and s not unduly complicated even where selectivity is considerably less than optimum, as might occur when the reaction time is relatively short. As one illustrative example, the silylation step may be carried out bv using a relative molar ratio of uridlne to sllylation reagent of about 1 3 to about 1 4 in pyridlne, which serves both as a solvent and as a base or catalyzing ne reaction. The reaction proceeds satisfactorily at ambient temperatures and will provide high selectivity and conversion for the desired species after a reaction time cf 60 hours or so. The particular process parameters can be varied within wide limits, as may be desired. A variety of solvents are useful, including dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like. Other useful catalysts include imidazole, 2, 6 lutidine, triethylamine or the like.Useful temperatures range from about 10 C. to about 500C. with reaction times ranging from no more than 20 minutes or so to as much as 100 hours or so. The second step of the procedure in accordance with the present invention involves the formation of 2 , 5 diblocked chromogenic and or fluorogenic uridine 3 phosphodiester by the reaction or the 2 , 5 diblocked mononucleoslde with a suitable derivative form of the chromophore and or fluorophore, as depicted below EMI17.1 The mononucleotide 3 phosphodiesters so formed may be read ily handled and chromatographed due to their enhanced soluability in organic solvents, if desired. Functionally, R can be derided as any functional group which will movie the substrate with fluorogenic anchor chromogenic properties. The R group may be an acryl, araalkyl, heteroaryl or heterocyclic compound. In the pre ferred embodiment, R is umbelliferonyl, 4 methylumDelli feronyl and 3 flavonyl. Other suitable R groups include aryls such as, for example, 1 napthyl. Further, other R groups which are suitable are aryl groups which incorporate electron withdrawing and conjugating substituents which increase the acidity of ortho and para benzoic acids.Such groups include, ortho, meta and para nitrophenyl, dinitrophenyl, cyanophenyl, acylphenyl, carboxyphenyl, phenylsulfonate, phenylsulfonyl and phenylsulfoxide. In general, mixtures of mono and bi substituted derivatives may likewise be suitable. The formation of the desired phosphodiester should be conducted, of course, in a fashion adequate to insure that no or only a minimum disruption of the key functionalities occurs. Desirably, the formation should likewise allow use of relatively mild reaction conditions to provide a product capable of being readily isolated in high yields.These general objectives may be suitably accomplished by, in general, either reacting the uridine directly with a phosphorylated derivative of the desired chrCmophore and cr fluorophore or by first converting uridine to a 3 phosphorylated derivative and then reaction with an alcoholic derivative of the chromo ore and or fluorophore. The first approach can be carried out by two synthetic schemes. One scheme involves reaction of the phosphate derivative of the chromophoreJfluorophore with the 2 , 5 diblocked mononucleoside in the presence of a suitable condensation agent. Importantly, the reagent selected should provide a high yield of ester product at mild reaction conditins. Toluenesulfonyl chloride, mesitylenesulfor.yl imidazo lide, p toluenesulfonyl imidazolide, 2, 4, 6 triisopropylben zenesulfonyl chloride, mesitylenesulfonyl chloride, picryl sulfonyl chloride, N, dicyciohexylcarboiinide, 1 3 di methylaminopropyl 3 ethylcarbodiimide hyd rochl orde, and other carbodiimide analogs with or without additives such as, N hydroxy succinimide, and N hydroxyphthalimide are illustrative examples. The use of 2, 4, 6 triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride and N, N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide have been found to be satisfactory. The relative ratio of 2 , 5 diblocked nononucleo side to the phosphorylated chromogenic and or fluorogenic derivative should be in the molar range of at least 1 to 1, desirably employing an excess of such derivative. A ratio of 1 2 has been found satisfactory for the amount of the nucleoside to that of the condensation agent, but excesses up to perhaps 1 5 or so may likewise be perhaps useful. The reaction may be carried out in an aprotic polar solvent such as N, N imethy1fcrnvtiide, cioxane or tetrahydro furan and the like, in the presence of a base such as pyridine, triethylamine and the like. Suitably, dry pyridine base as a solvent may be used at a temperature in the range of from about 200C. to about 250C. with a reaction time of 5 to 18 hours. A reaction temperature range of from about 20 C. to about 50OC. and a time period of about 2 to 72 hours should likewise be satisfactory. The second synthetic scheme involves starting with a chromogenic and or fluorogenic alcohol. The alcohol may first be phosphorylated in situ to form a reactive interme dilate which is then reacted with the 2 , 5 disilylated blocked mononucleoside to form the phosphodiester. The hosphorylation reaction may be carried out by employing any of the numerous phosphorylation reagents known in the art, such as, for example, phosphorous oxychloride, 2, 2, 2 trichloroethyl phosphorodichloridite, or the like.The phosphcr ylation is carried out, typically utilizing an excess of the phosphorylation reagent, in an aprotic solvent such as N, Ndimethylformamide, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or the like, in the presence of a base, such as, pyridine or triethylamine.Pyridine may be used as the solvent and base. The excess phosphorylating reagent may then be removed from the reactive intermediate before further reaction to form the 2 , 5 disilylblocked mononucleoside phosphodiester. Suitable reaction conditions include employing dry pyridine base at a temperature in the range of from about 10 C. to about 300C. and a reaction time of about 1 to about 3 hours. A temperature range of about 78aC. to about 80 C.and reaction times of from about 5 minutes to about 5 hours should likewise be suitable. In a ffrst alternative, but related aspect of the invention, the 2 , 5 disilylated blocked mononucleoside may be phosphorylated to form a diblocked mononucleotide inteae irate, which may then be reacted with a chromogenic and or fluorogenic alcohol to form the 2 , 5 disilylated blocked mononucleotide phosphodiester. In the second approach, the 2 , 5 aiblockea nucleoside derivative is first phosphorylated to form a reactive intermediate which is then reacted with the chromophore and or fluorophore alcohol. The phosphorylation and suSse cuent ester cr,ming reactions may suitably be carried out aspreviously described in con unction with the first approach. The phosphorylated nuclecside derivative can be either the acid chloride or the acid itself. In the latter instance, a condensation reagent should be employed, as has been previously described in conjunction with the first approach. In acccrdance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, a 2 , 5 disilylblocked mcncnucleotide is first prepared by the reaction of a 3 mononucleotide and a silylating reagent, as shown schematically below EMI21.1 wherein R is a silyl blocking group, and B is a base, as previously defined herein.The 2 , 5 disilylblocked uriane monophosphate may then be condensed with the chramo cena and or fluorogenic alcohol to form the 2 , 5 disilyl blocked mononucleotide 3 phosphodiester. The silyation and condensation reactions may be carried out utilizing the process parameters previously discussed n the first approach. The 2 , 5 disilylblocked substrate is a stable compound which may be stared for extended periods of time.However, blocking is necessary to provide a suitable sub strate for use in monitoring the enzymatic or catalytic activity in applications such as non isotopic immunoassays. Deblocking of the substrate may be readily carried out with the use of several different reagents without sig nlficant deleterious hydrolytic cleavage of the deblocked substrate. The reagents should, of course, be mild enough so that the phosphate diester bond is not cleaved during the deblocking step. Also, and importantly, the reagent should be capable of being readily separated from the phosphodiester substrate and should not inhibit or otherwise interfere with the subsequent intended application. Suitable reagents include acids, ammonium halide salts, inorganic halide salts and the like. Generally, tetrabutylammonium fluoride, trityl fluoroborate, lithium tetrafluoroborate, hydrogen fluoride, acetic acid, and hydrochloric acid may be used. Tetrabutyl amman us fluoride has been found suitable. The blocking reaction is generaily carried out in a protic or aprotic polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, cioxane, pyridine or water using an excess of the blocking reagent. As an example, a 1M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran may be employed at z temperature of about 15 C. to about 300C. for a period of from about 20 minutes to about 50 minutes. The temperature range may suitably extend from about 0 C. to about OOC. with reaction. times of as little as about 10 minutes up to perhaps 120 minutes or so. The following Examples are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as a lmitation on the scope thereof. EXAMPLE I This Example il1ustrates the preparation of 2 , 5 bis t butyldimethylsilyluridine. In the preparation of 2 , 5 bis t butyldimethylsil yl utidine, 11.39 g, 0.0466 mole, of uridine was dissolved in 80 ml of pyridine by stirring at room temperature for about 5 min. Then 21.09 g,0.140 mole, t butyldimethylsilyl chloride was added to the pyridine solution and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 62 hours in a flask fitted with a drying tube. The reaction mixture was diluted with 150 ml ether and then filtered to remove pyridine HCl.The ether pyridine filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and then in high vacuum using a liquid nitrogen trap. Thin layer chromatography of an awl quoit of the reaction product mixture on silica el plate, with a solvent of, by volume, two parts ether and one part exane showed three components, respectively, at Rf 0.65, 0.5 and 0.3. The remainder of the oily reaction product mixture was chromatographed on z 4.2 x 44 cm silica gel column compris ing Silica gel 60 M Reagent, Lot No. 7953179 , of particle size 0.063 0.2 mm and 70 230 mesh ASTM with a solvent of, by volume, two parts humane ane one part ethy2 acetate, to separate the thee components of the reaction product mixture. The fractions having R4 of 0.5, identified by thin layer chromatography at the conditions given above, were combined.Additionally, reactions containinc the Rf 0.3 and 0.65 components were rechromatographed to isolate additional Rf 0.5 product. The Rf 0.5 fractions were combined to give a yield of 8.961 g, tat is 40.5 . The melting point 123 125 C. any n.m.r. spectrum CDC13 of the product confirmed the product as 2 , 5 bis t butylmethylsilyluridine. EXAMPLE II This Example illustrates the preparation of 2 , 5 bis t butyldimethylsilyl 3 uridine 1 naphthyl phosphate. The dsodium salt of 1 naphthyl phosphate, 1.814 g, 6.77 mmoles, was converted into the per minium salt using a Bio Rad AGR 50 W X8 cation exchange column. The resulting pyridinium salt solution was concentrated at room temperature in vacuum. A solution of 3.197 g, 6.77 mmoles of 2 , 5 bis t butyldimethylsilyluridine, prepared in Example I, in 50 ml of dry pyridine was added to a solution of the concentrated pyridinium salt in 50 ml dry pyridine. The mixture was dried twice by stripping pyridine off, using 50 ml of dry pyridine for each drying operation. The resulting glassy residue was edissolved in 10 ml of dry pyridine and 2.6 g of 2, 4, 6 triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred in the dark at room temperature for 20 hours and then concentrated to dry ness in vacua at room tllperatre. Thin layer chromatography of a portion of the crude product on silica gel using a solvent system comprised of hexane, methanol, methylene chloride and triethylamine in the ratio, by volume, of 5 2 2 0.5, showed one major spot at 0.5 and minor spots at the origin, Rf 0.81 and R 0.75.Under these conditions, the starting material had an Rf of 0.75, and the diester had an Rf cf 0.5. The crude mixture was then chromatographed on a 23 x 2.5 cm Silica Gel G column to separate the components. The column was eluted sequentially with 100 ml of chloroform, i00 ml of 5 methanol in chloroform, and 808 methanol in chloroform until the eluant showed product. Eluant fractions of twenty ml each were collected. Fractions 10 to 8 were identified by thin layer chromatography at the conditions given above, as containing the phosphodiester product Rf 0.5 . These fractions were combined and concentrated to give 4.721 g of tan colored product.The melting point, 83 86 C., and infrared spectrum in KBr and n.m.r. spectrum CDC13 of the product confirmed the product as 2 , 5 bis t butyldimethylsilyl 3 uridine l naphthyl phosphate. EXAMPLE III This Example illustrates the preparation of 3 uri dine 1 naphthyl phosphate. The 2 , S bis t butyldimethylsilyl 3 uridine 1 .naphthyl phosphate prepared in Example II, 75 mg, was treated with 3.2 ml of 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 minutes, and then the solvent was removed by evaporation in vacuo to leave the crude product residue.The residue was dissolved in 2 ml of water, and extracted 3 times with 5 ml portions each of ether to remove unwanted byproducts. The aqueous solution was blown by a stream of nitrogen to remove any residual ether to thus obtain 3 u i dine l naphthyl phosphate solution, essentially free of byproducts. The 3 uridine l naphthyl phosphate solution was buffered with 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer of about pH 5 and used in the thyroxine assays set forth in Examples XVII,XVIII and XXIX in the previously identified copending Farina et al. application. EXAMPLE IV This Example illustrates the preparation of 2 , 5 bis tert butyldimethylsilyl 3 uridine 4 methylumbelli rerone 7 yl phosphate. In this Example, 2 , 5 bis tert butyldmethylsilyl uridine is phosphorylated to form a reactive intermediate which is reacted with 4 methylumbelliferone. In a round bottom flask, 0.2386 g of 2 , 5 bistert butyldimethylsilyluridine, prepared in Example I, was dissolved in 5 ml of dry pyridine. The solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The solid residue was redissolved in 7 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran and 4 ml of pyridine, and cooled with stirring in an ice water bath under exclusion of atmospheric moisture. To the stirred cold solution there was added 0.5 ml of phosphorus oxychloride, using an air tight syringe. The mixture was allowed to stir for 5 minutes in a cooling bat, and ten at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Pvriaine F.C salt was deposited in the bottom of the flask. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by thin layer chromatography to monitor the formation of the intermediate. The chromatography was carried out on a silica gel plate with a solvent system comprising ethyl acetate, chloroform and hexane in the ratio, by yolume, of 5 2 3. The analysis showed a component with Rf near the origin. However, there was no component with Rf 0.55 thereby ncicatlnc that the uridine starting materIal had been completely c nsumed. The remainder of the reaction mixture was concen traded in vacuo using a liquid nitrogen tra to remove unreacted phosphorus oxychloride. To the residue there was added 0.107 g of 4 methylumbelliferone, and the mixture was cooled in an ice water bath under nitrogen atinosphere to exclude atmos heric moisture. To the mixture there was added 4 ml of dry pyridine, and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 40 minutes. An aliquot of the resulting light yellow solution was analyzed by thiwl layer chromatography, at the same conditions as given above. A new fluorescent spot, believed to be 2 , 5 bis tert butyldimethylsilyl 3 uridine 4 methylumbel liferone 7 yl phosphate, was found. The remainder of the solution was concentrated in vacuo to a glassy oil. The oil was suspended in 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran THF . To the THF suspension, there was added 20 ml of ether and the mixture was stored in a cold room, about 4 to 80C., to precipitate product. The product as obtained in this fasion was collected by filtration and dried over P205 in vacuo to yield 0.572 g of light gray powder. The product was confirmed by n.m.r. to contain 2 , 5 bistert butyldimethylsilyluridine 3 4 methylumbelliferone 7 yl phosphate. The 2 , 5 bis tert butvldimethylsilyl uridine 3 4 methylumbelliferone 7 yl phosphate was deblocked following the same procedure as set forth in Example III, to form 3 uridine 4 methylumbelliferone 7 yl phosphate, which was identified by enzyme assay. In an assay with RNase enzyme, the assay mixture was excited at 325 nm and emission was monitored at 450 nrn corresponding to the fluorogenic 4 methyl umbellifsrcne, resulting from catalytic hydrolysis of 3 uridine 4 methylumbelliferone 7 yl phosphate.
