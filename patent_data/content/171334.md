# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE STABILIZATION OF DIRECT CURRENT ARC LAMPS

## Abstract
A system for stabilizing the arc in a DC arc lamp. An AC signal is superimposed on the DC power source of the lamp to cause small regular fluctuations in the arc. The small fluc tuations prevent large fluctuations while the small regular fluctuations may be averaged to obtain a constant average value. The average is taken over 5 to 10 periods of the AC signal to produce a constant average signal with a very small standard deviation.
