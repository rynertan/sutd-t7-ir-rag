# Electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
An improved electromagnetic relay in which movable contact pieces 21 of contact mechanisms 20 are fitted into grooves 16 formed in arm portions 15 of a movable base 13 for a movable block 10 , while small projections 21a formed on the movable contact pieces 21 are fitted into recesses 17 further formed in the grooves 16 so as to fix the movable base 13 to the movable contact pieces 21 without any positional displacement or deviation for the prevention of various characteristic variations resulting from such deviation so as to maintain stable working characteris tics over a long period.
