# Reinforced and earthed antistatic laminates for use as barriers against fluids ignitable by electrostatic discharge.

## Abstract
The present invention is an antistatic laminate which has at least one continuous layer of an electrically conductive material formed by a metal foil or a metallised surface of a polymer film, eg an aluminised polyester film and at least one layer of a non conducting reinforcing scrim both layers being sandwiched between two layers of polymer film, and means for earthing the electrically conductive material. The anti static laminate may be disposed as a barrier within any container for storage or transportation of flammable fluids to divide the container into an air space and a liquid space. These laminates are flexible, very light in weight and yet robust, and have the necessary antistatic properties to minimise the installation, economic and safety problems of conventional barriers. Their low permeability also minimises the unnecessary discharge of obnoxious vapours into the environment.

## Description
ANTI STATIC LkMIRATES FOR USE AS BARRIERS AGAINST FLUIDS IGNITABLE BY ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE The present invention. relates to antistatic larinates caitable for use as a protective barrier against flammable fluids. Volatile liquids may be lost either during the filling of storage tanks or due to breathing caused by temperature variations. In designing storage tanks for flammable volatile liquids such as petroleum products, this loss poses three main proble, namely a environmental pollution, eg by products such as gasoline or petrol which contain hydrocarbons and additives such as tetraethyllead to improve their performance b the susceptibility of such fluids to ignition eg by static electrical discharge and c the economic implications of both the vapour loss and the tank design needed to minimise such loss. Various methods have been used to overcome these problems including floating decks, vapour balancing systems and collapsible bag techniques, the latter being described in our US Patent No 4079856. Of these, the commercially viable collapsible bag has certain disadvantages arising from the materials from which it is made. Firstly, these materials if made sufficiently flexible tend not to be robust enough to withstand normal wear and tear during installation in a tank or in operation however, if they are made thicker they become too heavy. Secondly, the movement of the bag in use may generate electrostatic charges which are also carried by the flammable liquid in the tank.Such storage tanks come in various shapes and sizes throughout the petroleum distribution system including ocean going vessels, refinery and depot storage, rail and road tankers, forecourt tanks for dispensing petrol or gasoline to automotive vehicles and the storage tanks in the vehicles themselves. Ideally, the bags should be flexible, robust, of theminimuraweight possible, and antistatic for nase of installation in tanks of any design without the need for use of cumbersome, expensive or sophisticated equipment and to minimise the loading on the tank structure. Polymer sheets, films and laminates produced hitherto for such uses have had desirable mechanical and barrier properties, but they also have a very high surface resistivity and high volume resistivity. This leads to the generation and accumulation of electrostatic charges which renders them unsuitable, and in some cases unsafe, particularly where they are to be used in environments where explosive gaseous mixtures may occur. Various techniques have hitherto been suggested to offset the hazards of electrostatic discharge in such environments. One method that has been suggested is to coat the base film with a conductive material but this is unsatisfactory because the coating tends to lift from the base film particularly when the conductive material is exposed to the liquid thus reducing the effectiveness of the system.To overcome this problem it has been suggested that such laminates be used in a manner whereby the conductive material is furthest from the liquid but this suffers from the same drawback if the coating lifts and separates from the polymer. Another suggested method is to incorporate conductive additives into the film during manufacture but these methods can result in a deterioration in mechanical properties and particularly in their ability to be joined by heat sealing. It has now been found that some important electrical properties of such laminates may be improved to safe levels without substantially impairing their mechanical and physical properties and in many cases the mechanical properties will be improved. Accordingly the present invention is an anti static laminate comprising at least one continuous layer of an electrically conductive material formed by a metal foil or a metallised surface of a polymer film and at least one layer of a non conducting reinforcing scrim both layers being sandwiched between two layers of polymer film, and means for earthing the electrically conductive material. According to a further embodiment, the present invention also comprises a container provided with an anti static laminate comprising at least one continuous layer of an electrically conductive material formed by a metal foil or a metallised surface of a polymer film and at least one layer of a nonconducting reinforcing scrim both layers being sandwiches between two layers of polymer film and means for earthing the electrically conductive material, the anti static laminate being disposed within the container to divide the container into an air space and a liquid space. The layer of electrically conductive material is either in the form of a metal foil or in the form of a metallised polymer. The latter may be produced by depositing a metal coating on the surface of a film of any of the well known polymers having the desired mechanical and physical properties.Examples of polymers that may be used include polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinyl chloride polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene, fluorinated polyetylene, polypropylene, and the like. Films from some of these polymers may have to be previously treated to improve surface adhesion before using them in the laminate. Polyester or polyvinyl fluoride films are most preferred. The metal in the layer of electrically conducting material is suitably an oxidation resistant metal of high conductivity such as copper, aluminium, silver, gold, palladium or nickel. It is desirable that the thickness of the metal in the layer of electrically conducting material is as low as possible in order to minimise not only the total weight of the laminate per unit of area but also the risk of that layer cracking or fracturing on repeated flexion.Thus the thickness of the metal is suitablybetweenO.Ol and 1 micron.It is preferred to use as the layer of electrically conductive material the aluminised surface of a polyester film. The non conductive scrim may be formed from any of the polymers referred to above in the context of the metallised polymer film or of cellulosic material. It is preferable to form the scrim from a petroleum resistant material such as polyester or polyvinyl fluoride. Since one of the functions of the scrim is to reinforce the laminate, it is preferable 2 that the mesh of the scrim is not greater than 10 cm Another function of the scrim is to provide delaminated areas on the laminate which allows access for maintaining electrical contact during jointing, mechanical welding or earthing.Provision for delamination may also be r.ade on the polymer film adherent to the layer of conducting material by including at specific points during lamination release agents which may be non adherent layers. Examples of such release agents include siliconised paper and sprayed polytetrafluroethylene. In the anti static laminate, the continuous layer of electrically conductive material and the scrim are sandwiched between two layers of polymer film, which may be formed from any of the polymers referred to above. Where the electrically conductive layer is formed by the metallised surface of a polymer film, one of the laminating polymer films is preferably the polymer film having the metallised surface. In this case this film is laminated to the second film with the metallised surface in between. In the laminates of the present invention the electrically conductive material is provided with earthing means. This may simply be a strip of metallised polymer or a metal foil adhered by a conducting adhesive which enables the metal surface to be earthed. It is preferable that the earthing means does not pierce the polymer films on either side of the laminate because it may lead to ingress of air or flammable vapour within the lamination thus weaking the laminate. If the polymer films are pierced, the pierced area should preferably be sealed off with a piece of bonded film. It is a feature of the antistatic laminate of the present invention that the ear thing of the conductive material inside the laminate prevents discharge of electrostatic charges on the outer surface of the relatively non conducting polymer film forming the laminate. This is surprising because the conducting surface is isolated from both the actual charge and the flammable vapour, which usually carries a residual charge, in spite of which it prevents transmission of the electrostatic charge or the build up of such electrostatic charges. Tne laminates of the present invention have the conductive material sandwiched between layers of polymer and tm Is novel design prevents the conductive material fro being lifted of the polymer due to continuous abrasion and contact between the polymer and the volatile liquid during transpcrtation or storage.As added protection against accidental delamination when in use in a container, the laminate is preferably disposed within the container such that the layer of the polymer film furthest from the cc nductive material is adjacent the liquid space. The bonding of the layers of the polymer film with the elect ically conductive material and the non conductive scri., may b carried out in any conventional manner. It is preferable to laminate the layers by heat to produce a fairly flexible, impermeable laminate. The laminating may be carried out either by impulse heat sealing or by ultrasonic sealing in order to produce a strong bond. Alternatively, the conductive layer may be barded to the polymer film or scrim by using an adhesive compound, preferably one filled with conducting material such as carbon or metal powder.When using an adhesive for joining two laminates in order to fabricate structures it must be ensured that he electrical continuity is maintained across the weld.This rlay again.be achieved by using an adhesive compound, filled with rnducting material such as carbon or metal powder. These adhesive compounds filled with conducting materials may also be used for reinforcing areas of the laminate subjected to maximum flexing and bending during use thus minimising the risk of break in electrical contact due to cracks or fractures on the metallised surface. Welding and jointing of such laminates ensuring continuity of contact between the layers of conductive material may be achieved by cutting sections across the delaminaced areas to expose the conductive material. Contact between the exposed materials from two laminates may then be established by conventional techniques using wires, foils or metal deposited polymers. Such a facility of citing and welding enables fabrication of laminated sheets of irregular shapes in R i ch the edges oE the sheets are non parallei and yet retain continuity of contact between the conductive layers. Alternatively, for simpler applications, the laminates may be produced using layers of conductive material having a greater surface area than the covering polymer films thus exposing the conductive material beyond the edges of the laminate. The laminates of the resent invention suitably have m overall thickness between 100 and 400 microns preferably between 100 ar.d 200 microns. If measured at points wheres the strands of the scrim are not included., the thickness varies between 25 and 70 microns. To achieve this polymer films varying in thickness between 10 and 50 microns may be used. When used in a container for flammable liquids the polymer film of the laminate directly in contact with the liquid should preferably be thicker than the polymer film in contact with the airspclce. Laminates of the present invention are particularly uc eful for lining containers and as seals in storage tanks which tranciport flammable fluids. Typical examples of liquids and gases which are continuously being transported and are susceptible to igni ion on exposure to electrostatic discharge are organic liquids particularly gasoline and benzene. They may also be used to produce plastic floating decks in such tanks, in gasoline transfer hoses, and to produce protective clothing and carpets.
