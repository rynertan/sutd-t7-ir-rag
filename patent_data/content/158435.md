## Description
This invention relates to a novel thermostable pullulanase possessing a wide optimum operating pH zone and a process for the production thereof. Pullulanase was first discovered by Bender et al. as an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing pullulan, a polysaccharide produced by Pullularia pullulan, in Aerobacter aerogenese Biochem. Biophys. Acta., Recently α 1,6 glucosidase has been found to be effective in enhancing the yield of sugars as in the production of glucose from starch and in the production of maltooligosaccharides such as maltose, maltotriose, maltotertraose, maltopentaose, and maltohexaose from starch as well. Unfortunately, most conventionally known α 1,6 glucosidases such as pullulanase and isoamylase are generally deficient in thermal stability and possess optimum operating temperatures in the range of 45 to 50 C and a narrow operating pH range. Thus, there have been technical and economic obstacles to their indiscriminate effective use in combinations with all the amylases including those enzymes such as glucoamylase which act on the acid side and excel in thermal stability optimum operating pH in the neighborhood of 4.5 and optimum operating temperature 60 C and maltooligosaccharide producing enzymes of microorganic origins having optimum operating pH values in the neutral through alkaline ranges. Attempts have been made in EP A 63909 to provide an effective pullulanase. This is derived from a bacterium of the genus Bacillus and has an optimum operating temperature over the range 0 to 75 C. We have now found the above problems may be alleviated by utilizing a pullulanase produced by This invention has issued from efforts devoted to overcoming the aforementioned disadvantage of the prior art. It aims to provide a pullulanase having a wide optimum operating pH range and excelling in thermal stability and a process for the production of the enzyme. The thermostable pullulanase provided by this invention offers the advantage that it can be effectively used in combination with all amylases including glucoamylase, β amylase, and amylases capable of producing maltotriose and maltooligosaccharides of higher orders and can effectively produce glucose, maltose, etc. from starch. The procedure for carrying out this invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate specific embodiments, in which Microorganisms widely distributed in the natural world were screened in search of an α 1,6 glucosidase having a wide optimum operating pH range and excelling in thermal stability. As a result, the pullulanase produced by a bacterium isolated from soil and identified as In earlier editions of Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, The Williams Wilkins Co., In Japanese Patent Publication SHO 51 1976 5072, there is a statement to the effect that As described above, the heretofore known pullulanases and α 1,6 glucosidases produced by bacteria of genus As concerns the optimum operating pH, the optimum operating pH of pullulanase and α 1,6 glucosidase from As microorganisms known as capable of producing α 1,6 glucosidase of relatively high thermal stability, there may be cited the pullulanase from genus As described above, the enzyme from genus Now, the enzymatic character of the pullulanase of the present invention will be described in detail below. The mycological character of the novel thermostable pullulanase producing bacterium to be used in the present invention will be described below. From the mycological quality described above, it is judged proper by reference to Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th edition The Williams Wilkins Co., 1974 , to identify this bacterium to be one strain of This Examples of the nitrogen source utilizable for the production of the novel thermostable pullulanase by this bacterium include organic nitrogen sources such as peptone, meat extract, and corn steep liquor and inorganic nitrogen sources represented by ammonium salts such as urea, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium phosphate and nitrates such as sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate. Among the nitrogen sources enumerated above, urea proves a particularly desirable nitrogen source. As carbon sources, generally corn starch, potato starch, sweet potato starch, glutinous corn starch, glutinous rice starch, and their derived products are usable. Particularly desirable are polysaccharides such as glutinous corn starch, glutinous rice starch, and amylopectin which abound with branched bonds. To a culture medium containing a starchy polysaccharide, lactose is added. The lactose is amply effective when it is added to the medium in an amount of about 0.1 . Generally, when the lactose is added in an amount of about 0.5 to 1 , the amount of pullulanase produced is two to three times as large as when no lactose is added. Besides the aforementioned nitrogen source and carbon source, phosphate and magnesium salt and small amounts of salts of such metals as calcium and manganese are added as supplements for the culture medium. The culture is carried out at a pH value in the range of 5 to 9 and a temperature in the range of 20 The thermostable pullulanase is produced extracellularly and produces substantially no enzyme harmful to the application of the pullulanase such as α amylase. On completion of the culture, therefore, the enzyme can be easily recovered from the culture medium by filtering or centrifuging the culture medium thereby separating cells and recovering the supernatant and concentrating the supernatant, or optionally salting out the enzyme as with ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate, or precipitating the enzyme by addition of an organic solvent such as acetone, isopropanol, ethanol, or methanol. Commercial production of this enzyme, therefore, can be carried out advantageously from the economic point of view. Further, since the thermostable pullulanase has its optimum operating pH in a wide range of about 4.5 to about 7.5 and excels in thermal stability as described above, it can be made to react effectively with any of the known amylases, including glucoamylase for producing glucose from starch, β amylase of both plant and bacterial origin for producing maltose from starch, amylase from bacteria of genus The present applicant has proposed a process for producing maltose from starch with enzymes from a bacterium of genus The saccharification of starch by the use of the enzyme of this invention is carried out on liquefied starch having a DE index of the ratio of decomposition of starch, expressed in percentage by the reducing sugar determined as glucose in solids value of not more than 10 used in a concentration of 10 to 40 at pH 5 to 7 and a temperature in the range of 50 Now, the present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to working examples.
