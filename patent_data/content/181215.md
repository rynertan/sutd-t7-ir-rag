# Apparatus for detecting motion of television images.

## Abstract
Apparatus for detecting motion of a television image comprises a circuit 56,65 for summing the magnitudes of differences in pixel data between a current frame and a previous frame for each of a plurality of regions 71 which are formed by dividing an image of one field 70 and for detecting movement vectors from the frame difference summation data for each of the regions 71 , a circuit 6 for calculating a residual deviation when correction of overall movement of the field 70 is performed using each of the plurality of movement vectors, and a selector 5 for selecting that movement vector which gives the minimum residual deviation.
