# PROCESS TO SUPERPOSE TWO POSITIVE PHOTORESIST LAYERS

## Abstract
This process for superposing two positive photoresist layers on a semiconductor device includes the steps of forming a fluorine containing coating on a portion of the first positive resist layer, baking the thus obtained coated portion between 160 C and 250 C and for 10 to 30 minutes without modifying the properties of the first resist layer, and depositing the second positive resist layer on the thus hardened portion.
