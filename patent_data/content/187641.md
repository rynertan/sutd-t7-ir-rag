# TV system conversion apparatus.

## Abstract
The picture quality deterioration such as judder caused by TV frame number conversion can be mitigated by selectng either the stationary original picture signal or the motion compensated interpolated picture signal based on the most adaptive motion vector corresponding to the smallest interframe difference between the original picture signal and the motion compensated picture signals based on the motion vectors individually detected from divisional picture areas. The effect of this mitigation can be increased by weighting the detected motion vectors and by smoothing the contour between motion compensated picture areas with the aid of filtering.
