# Rotary encoder apparatus.

## Abstract
A rotary encoder apparatus of an incremental type construction, including a rotary unit mechanically joined to a movable machine a unit for outputting at least two signals having a phase shift and a periodic waveform in response to rotation of the rotary unit a battery type power supply and an electric circuit including a circuit for generating a timing pulse having predetermined frequency and pulse width, a circuit for detecting a change of the signals from the signal outputting circuit and for outputting a pulse signal in response to the change of signals, and a circuit for counting the pulse signal from the signal change detecting circuit. The apparatus may be optical or magnetic in construction.
