# Process for the preparation of polyacetylene.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a polyacetylene compound with a bulk density greater than 0.6 g cm³ and with a surface area lower than 60 m² g. It relates also to a process for the preparation of polyacetylene consisting in polymerizing gaseous acetylene in the presence of a catalytic system consisting of 1 an oxygenized titanium or vanadium compound containing at least one metal oxygen bond 2 an organometal aluminum compound containing at least one heteroatom and having the formula
