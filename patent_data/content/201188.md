Generally, compounds of Formula I are conveniently synthesized by methods shown in Scheme I and Scheme II. In Scheme I the substituted pyrazole of Formula VI prepared by methods shown in US Patent Number 3,553,209, is treated with a mixture of sulfuric acid and fuming nitric acid at a temperature of about 80 100 C to effect nitration. The amide of Formula IV is synthesized from the acid in the usual manner by treating with thionyl chloride followed by pouring the resulting acid chloride into icy ammonium hydroxide. This nitro amide pyrazole is converted to the amine of Formula III by catalytic hydrogenation utilizing Raney nickel as a catalyst using conditions appropriate for hydrogenation.

The compounds can be administered in such oral unit dosage forms as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, or granules. They also may be administered rectally, vaginally in such forms as suppositories or bougies they may also be introduced parenterally e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, or intramuscular ly , using forms known to the pharmaceutical art. They are also introduced directly to an affected area, e.g, by inhalation . In general, the preferred route of administration is orally. An effective quantity of the compound is employed in treatment. The dosage regimen for preventing or treating the symptoms as described above by the compounds of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the type, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the mammal, the severity of the symptoms, the route of administration, and the particular compound employed.

Daily dosages of the compounds of the invention are ordinarily in the area of 0.1 mg kg up to at least 100 mg kg per dose orally, preferably 1 to 50 mg kg orally and are given from one to four times daily or as needed. When other forms of administration are employed equivalent doses are administered. When dosages beyond 200 mg kg are employed, care should be taken with each subsequent dose to monitor possible toxic effects. The compounds of Formula I have been found to possess affinity for adenosine receptors designated A₁ for convenience . Whole brain minus cerebellum and brainstem from male Long Evans rats 150 200 g was homogenized in 30 volumes of ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 using a Brinkman Polytron PT 10, setting number 6 for 20 seconds and centrifuged for ten minutes at 20,000 x g Sorvall RC 2 , 4 C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and centrifuged as before. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml Tris HCl buffer containing two International Units ml of adenosine deaminase Sigma type III from calf intestinal mucosa , incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes, then subsequently at 0 C for ten minutes. The homogenate was again centrifuged, and the final pellet was resuspended in ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 to a concentration of 20 mg ml original wet tissue weight and used immediately. Tissue homogenate 10 mg ml was incubated in 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7 containing 1.0 nM ³H N⁶ cyclohexyladenosine ³H CHA with or without test agents in triplicate for one hour at 25 C. Incubation volume was 2 ml. Unbound ³H CHA was separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman glass fiber GF B filters. The filters were rinsed three times with 5 ml of ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.7. The radio labeled ligand retained on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry after shaking the filters for one hour or longer on a mechanical shaker in 10 ml of Beckman Ready Solv HP scintillation cocktail. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding which occurred in the presence of 1 mM theophylline. The concentration of test agent which inhibited 50 of the specific binding IC₅₀ was determined by nonlinear computer curve fit. The Scatchard plot was calculated by linear regression of the line obtained by plotting the amount of radioligand bound mmoles gram of tissue versus The IC₅₀ values nM for adenosine A₁ receptor affinity is reported in Table 1.

R., The usefulness of the compounds of the present invention as cardiotonic agents is demonstrated by their effectiveness in standard pharmacological test procedures, for example, in causing a significant increase in the myocardial contractility in the pentobarbital anesthetized dog with low or minimal changes in heart rate and blood pressure. This test procedure is described in the following paragraphs. This screen consists of determining the effects of increasing intravenous doses of compound on mycardial contractility dP dt max of left ventri cular blood pressure , heart rate, and aortic blood pressure of the pentobarbital anesthetized dog. Adult mongrel dogs of either sex are anesthetized with pentobarbital, 35 mg kg, IV, and are subsequently maintained under anesthesia with a continuous infusion of pentobarbital, 3.5 mg kg hour. The trachea is intubated but the animals are permitted to breathe spontaneously. A cannula is inserted into the femoral vein for administering test agents. A Miller cathetar tip pressure transducer or a fluid filled cathetar is inserted into the ascending aorta via the femoral artery for measuring aortic blood pressure. A Miller cathetar tip pressure transducer is passed into the left ventricle via the left carotid artery for measuring left ventricular blood pressure. Needle electrodes are placed subcutaneously for recording a lead II electrocardiogram ECG . Left ventricular and aortic blood pressures are recorded on a strip chart recorder. Heart rate, using a biotachometer triggered from the R wave of the ECG, and the first derivative of left ventricular blood pressure dP dt , obtained with a differentiator amplifier coupled to the corresponding pressure amplifier, are also recorded. A period of at least 30 minutes is utilized to obtain control data prior to administration of test compound. Depending on solubility, the compounds are dissolved in 0.9 saline solution or in dilute HCl or NaOH 0.1 to 1.0 N and are diluted to volume with normal saline. Ethanol or dimethylacetamide can be used as solvents if adequate dilutions can be made. Appropriate vehicle controls are administered when needed. Each dose of the test compound is administered in a volume of 0.1 mg kg over a period of one minute. When tested by the above described Anesthetized Dog Procedure, the compounds of the present invention, for example, compound Ia of Example 1, when admin istered intravenously at about 0.01 to 0.31 mg kg cause dose related significant increases in cardiac contractility with only low or minimal changes in heart rate and a moderate reduction in blood pressure.

After 2.5 hours the reaction mixture is cooled and poured over ice. The resulting percipitate was filtered, dried, and recrystallized in ethanol, mp 141 142 C. Forty g of 1,3 dimethyl 4 nitropyrazole 5 carboxylic acid was stirred with 200 ml thionyl chloride at reflux for 3.5 hours. The excess thionyl chloride was distilled away under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was dissolved in acetone and added to icy ammonium hydroxide with stirring. The resulting percipitate was filtered and dried to give the product, mp 154 158 C. Fifty g of 1,3 dimethyl 4 nitropyrazole 5 carb oxamide dissolved in methanol, 2 g 50 aqueous Raney nickel added, was reduced under a hydrogen atmosphere until a 8.15 pound drop in pressure noted. The reaction mixture was filtered, the filtrate concen trated, and the crude material recrystallized in ethyl acetate to yield the product, mp 154 155 C. Fifty five g of 1,3 dimethyl 4 nitro 5 chloro pyrazole was dissolved in 400 ml acetonitrile and 17.45 g potassium cyanide added, followed by 0.5 g potassium iodide and 5 ml DMF.
