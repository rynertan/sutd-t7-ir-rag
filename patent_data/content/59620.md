# Wound drain catheter.

## Abstract
The wound drain catheter of the present invention is comprised of a drain portion 12 connected to an outflow tube portion 14 . The drain portion 12 comprises a central core 30 with plural T shaped members 32, 34 projecting therefrom to form plural lumens 38 having respective longitudinal grooves 36 for fluid communication with the wound. This drain 12 has a uniform cross sectional area and is preferably made from a silicone elastomer having a durometer shore between 40 and 70 shore A. Such uniform cross sectional area provides added strength to prevent the drain 12 from breaking during its removal from the patient s body, and the silicone elastomer provides sufficient elasticity to permit the cross sectional area of the drain 12 to decrease by at least 30 percent when a pulling force is applied thereto, thereby reducing the gripping force of tissue surrounding the wound.
