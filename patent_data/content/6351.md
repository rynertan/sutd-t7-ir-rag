# Method of processing image data.

## Abstract
One or more intermediate image lines L1 1 are inter polated by comparing image pixels on a pixel by pixel or multiple pixel basis one line pair at a time. The pixel com parison provides an address ADDRESS for a specific image pixel pattern 127 held in memory store 125 . The image pixel pattern addressed OUTPUT is taken from memory and used to form a part of the intermediate image line or lines being interpolated. The process is repeated until the entire intermediate image line or lines has been constructed.
