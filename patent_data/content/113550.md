The closure has a cap part 12 including a top 15 and a skirt 16 , a tear band 13 and a captive band 14 , the tear band 13 being connected to the skirt 16 and to the captive band 14 by lines of weakness 21, 22 and tell tale bridge members 24, 25, 26 are provided so that the tear band 13 cannot be removed without breaking the bridge members to provide the tamper resistant feature. To provide the child resistant feature the skirt 16 of the cap part has an internal projection 17 which can pass through an opening in an arcuate bead on an associated container only when the cap part is turned into a predeter mined position.
