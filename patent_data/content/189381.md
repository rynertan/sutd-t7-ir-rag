## Description
APPARATUS FOR CONTACT THERMOGRAPHY WITH ACQUISITION OF IMAGES BY MEANS OF A COLOUR TELECA1 ERA, DIGITAL CONVERSION SID PROCESSING OF THE OUTPUT DIGITAL DATAThe invention relates to an apparatus for contact thermography and particularly to an apparatus wherein the images evidn by the different colours taken on point by point by the liquid crystals of a thermographic plate when placed upon the surface of a body to be examined are shooted by a colour telecamera arranged as desired by means of an auxiliary pointing device, the composed video output being then passed to a Ã¬rst converter to convert the images into digital data.Each digital datum corresponds to a pixel , i.e. to a unit of the digital coded image, further qualified by the address with its co ordinates, luminosity and chrominance. The data as a whole are then sent to a pre processor to convert the chrominance code into temperature values and later on to a processor, the scope being to carry out following functions to draw out the information contained in single images to compose the images of a like subject obtained however by using different thermographic plates to compare images of a like subject obtained however at different times.The thermography, the scope of which is to evidence the distribution of the temperature on the surface of a body to be examined in detail, has from many years found a particular application to study pathologies which are producing an anomalous distribution of the temperature, in order to carry out a valid physio logical and diagnostic search thereabout. The noting and quan titative evaluation of such anomalous distribution have been and are updating considered of a particular importance by using frar d adiatlolzs emitted from the body surface, and explol ting suitable films or plates sensitive to such radiations, as well as proper telethermocamera fit for detecting these latter at a remote position.However, the telethermographic process requires the use of apparatus of considerable expense, so that in the last years the contact thermography has been developed to take advantage of the thermographic analysis as a dynamic method to perceive those thermic modifications which are associated to pathologic processes on the surface of the examined body, the judy and evaluation of same being obviously important for the diagnosis and consequent prognosis or watching, particularly when such analysis may prevent or diagnose some growing worses.The contact thermography makes use of the important feature of liquid crystals as a mesomorphic phase of the material, with the mechanical features of the liquids and the features of the crystals. However, it makes above all use of the proper features of some of these crystals with seibective reflection of white light and dependance of the resulting colour on the temperature when they are exposed to predetermined lighting and observation.On the other hand, some mixture of liquid crystals, eig. those of cholesterol, permit the pointing out of the thermic distribution on the examined surface.The liquid crystals in their updating use for contact thermogra phy take the shape of microballs encapsulated within a transpa rent polymer to form plates which may be differentiated on the ground of their thermic features, and are protected as much as possible against thermo optical alterations in order to minimize ageing phenomenons. t zordirio to the prior art, this dynamic method of contact tEler mograpy, while being economically advantageous in respect to the examination through infrared radiations emitted by single points of the tested surface, as suggested by the teletherniogra fic method, evidences, between other things, two disadvantages a allows practically only a qualitative analysis b permits a diagnosis as dependent on the subjective competency of the operator.Furthermore it is to be added that also when the best attention is paid and a suitable selection is made to perform the encapsulation of the microballs of liquid crystals, the thermo optical features of the prepared plates cannot be considered inalterable for a very long time, so that the checking and recalibration of the plates is necessary.The invention as claimed is intended to remedy these defectivenesses and drawbacks of the apparatus suggested and or applied in accordance with the prior art. It solves the problem of how to create a reliable apparatus to carry out a physiological and diagnostic search, particularly in the case of pathology concerning the manna also with qualitative evaluations and expenses loxtrer than for telethermographic examinations. Main object of the invention is to reach such finality by digitizing the images obtained by a amour telecamera for contact thermography, and pass the resulting digital data to a personal computer to process them like the propositions and display suggested for a telethermographic process.It is therefore an object of the invention to use plates for contact thermography and shoot by a colour telecamera the image shorn by the liquid crystals in accordance with the colour code, to indicate the temperature in different points of the plate and convert the composed video into digital data by a first composed video RGB converter, in order to draw out, separately, the fundamental component colours R G B Red Green Blue of the chrominantle luminance vector, as well as the horizontal and vertical synchronisms to be used for storing the digital data.It is another object of the present invention to use a converter of the temperature code, to receive the output digital data of said first converter which are indicative of the digitized image and pass them to a processor through a suitable interface cire cuital system comprising shift registers, dynamic RAM and threestate buffers, as well as through a pre processing function. The processor may be of the type used for telethermography, or suitable to exploit the tridimensionality because the programming of same is actually easy.The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig.l is a block diagram of an apparatus illustrating a preferable mode of carrying out the method of contact thermography in accordance wi th this invention Figs.2a and 2b font, in the whole, a detailed representation of a circuital system the components of which carry sequentially out the operative phases which go on from the conversion of the composed video resulting from the iooting by a colour telecamera into digital data, up tow the separation of the fundamental colours a first transitory storage of the digital data of the image resulting by the shoot and horizontal and vertical syn chronislns used to store same with a correct addressing the sending of information to a pre processor Fig.3 is a schematic view of a pre processor as conversion algorithm RGB chrominance and chrominance temperature, with formation of a matrix the units of which correspond to a temperature beam evidenced by the plate for contact thermography and are passed to a processor to be processed by carrying on the foreseen functions of the apparatus in accordance with the invention and permitted by the particular features of the components of that circuital system and pre processor.Turning now to the drawings and first of all to Fig.l , a block system is provided to show schematically an apparatus 10 comprising a liquid crystal plate 11 which may be placed into contact with the surface of a body to be examined and thus used for contact thermography a colour telecamera 12 which may be arranged as desired by means of an auxiliary device513 in order to shoot the image formed through the liquid crystals of plate 11 a circuital system 14 to convert the composed video into digi tized fundamental colours R G B of the chrominance luminance vector, to draw separately out the digitized data of component colours Red, Green, Blue as well as the horizontal and verti cal synchronisms to be used for storing the digitized data and then obtaining a whole of digital data, each one corresponding to a pixel or unit of the digitized image, qualified also by the address with its co ordinates, luminosity and chrominance, this latter being intended as a relative or absolute intensity of the three fundamental colours a pre processor 15 to draw out the relative intensity from the chrominance datum and convert same into temperature values to lzr c ompa ed with the elollr temDerature scale of the used ther mographic plate a processor 16 to process the output information of conver ter 15.To better understand the innovating features of the present invention a detailed description of same is reported hereafter, referred particularly to the detailed circuital system 14 the several components of which are illustrated in two sections to be interconnected, namely Fig.2a and Fig.2b.The composed video coming out from the telecamera 12 passes through a first composed video RGB converter indicated by the reference numeral 50 in Fit.2a, the scope of which is to provide the components R G B of the chrominance luminance vector, separately from each other, as well as the horizontal and vertical synchronisms, this latter being provided as a component for the storage of the digital converted data and indicated in Fig. 2a by reference numeral 69.As shown in Fig.2a, the analogic signal received by converter 50 is sent to three amplifiers 51, 52, 53 as SIGNAL ADAPTER BR NORMALIZER for RwC B, respectively, the input to the converters being so matched with a suitable impedance and regulated amplification, that the entire dynamic may be centered.FLASH A D CONVERTERS 54, 55, 56 receive the output signal of respective channel, each converter being operated according to a particular ECL Emitter Coupled Logic technique in order to carry out the conversion within a real time. As shown in the representative component blocks of FigS.2a and 2b, a resolution is of 4 bits required for the red and blue colours, while the resolution of 8 bits is required for the green colour, such requi rement being in accordance with the central position of the green colour in the spectrU n. The outputs of converters 54, 55, 56 pass to LATCHED SHIFT REGISTERS 57, 58, 59, respectively for a temporary storage and formation of messages to send to the memories. DYNAMIC RAM 60 to 63 and 64 to 67 see also Fig.2b contain the information relating to the entire image addressed during the acquisition by an ACQUISITION ADDRESS COUNTER component 68.The synchronism and clock of acquisition are drawn out from said SYNC.LOGIC ADDRESS.LOGIC 69 Fig.2a which keeps into account the video sychronisms H SYNC. V SYNC. with refresh control assigned to the A PR. REFRESH LOGIC component indicated by the reference numeral 70. This refresh circuit interve nes when the image memories are operated directly by the personal computer 15 16 of the apparatus, to carry out the transfer into processor 16 through pre processor 15 and provide also the exchange of the DATA and ADDRESSING BUS from the personal computer to the circuits of ADDRESS SELECTOR component 72. It is to point out that the total addressing capacity of the personal computer is extended from 16 to 20 bits by the logic of ADDRESS.LOGIC circuit 71 in order to cover the dynamic RAM capacity.As shown in Fig.2b, DYNAMIC RAM 16 x x 8 are provided and the addressing of same for line and column is drawn out from the circuits of an ADDRESS MULTIPLEXER 73.When the computer 15 16 asks for data from the memo ries, the addressing is to be arranged beforehand through inner address bus by activating the digital multiplexer 73 as well as the refresh circuit to be synchronized with the inner reading.The data bus is to be actived in those three state buffers which have been forbidden during the acquisition.As premised and shown in Figs.2b and 3, a pre processor 15 is provided as conversion algorithm RGB to relative chrominance and relative chrominance to temperature of the used termographic plate that is to say, a preliminary processor to draw out the chromatic scales by normalizing the component R in respect to G and then the component B in respect to G. The result of this operation involves two words of 12 bits, each one giving the possibility of selecting 8 steps. A conversion scale is in this manner created in the form of a matrix M of 8x8 64 units as shown schematically in Fig.3.It will be understood that, on the ground of this feature it is also possible to compose temperature scales more extended than those actually available, by using more matrixes when the employed plates have temperature intervals adjacent to each other or partially superimposed. It is also possible to verify and recalibrate the matrixes by acquiring a black body as a reference of calibration. intervalResults will thus be obtained which concern a suitable of measu rable temperatures a calibrated scale and the consequent conversion of the acquired colours into reliable temperature data. On the other hand conversion tables may be stored in pre processor 15 on semiconductor digital permanent memories e.g.EPROM, PROM, ROM and the like or also on magnetic digital permanent memories e.g. of the tape or disk type, either floppy , or hard , or bubble memory , as magnetic bubble memory . The selection of the table is made through identification of the used plate, and the calibration is made periodically by acquiring the reference to a known temperature, and storing on perma net memory the. valve of tEle corresponding calibration. In Fig.3 the processor 16 is shown as a dashed block only, reerred to the last component of the apparatus which, though being by itself a novel processing means to be claimed in accordance with the present invention, carries out functions according to known principles, namely to draw out the information contained in single images to compose images of the same subject obtained however by different thermographic plates with a consequent increase of the temperature dynamic to compare images of the same subject obtained however at different times.With regard to this, it is important to evidence that, for example, in the case of contact thermographic analysis relating to the mamma further to the usual display of image images from the right, left and front side, separately, for the right and left mamma , it is possible to add advantageously a tridimensional display programmed for the processor, as said above.It is also important to note that by using an apparatus provided with the components better detailed in Figs.2a, 2b and 3 it is foreseen the use of some other thermographic plates in addition to those which are in sale. As a matter of fact, while by using thermographic plates available at present according to the prior art, a really skilled operator may deduce immediately subjective evaluations on the ground of his own capacity of visual observation and give an opinion based on clean changes of colours usually from 3 to 8 different colours for the entire dynamic of temperatures by employing an apparatus in accordance with the present invention it is possible the use of some other plates indicative of colour shades that a human eye could not resolve and word quantitavely. It would be understood by the skilled in the art that because of such possibility the thennic resolution allowed by all apparatus according to this invention is higher, and the obtainable results are after all in keeping either for the diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for the watch.A further consideration is to be made with regard to the shooting by colour telecamera 12, i.e. that by the use of a suitable auxiliary pointing device 13 there is not a remarkable limitation of distance between plate 11 and telecamera 12 of an apparatus 10, differently from the limitation required when an apparatus for contact thermography in accordance with the prior art is employed wherein such distance is defined by the possible extension of the apparatus arm used for a thermografic examination and photographic shooting.
