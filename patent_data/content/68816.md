# Multilayer glazing structure.

## Abstract
There are problems with conventional multilayer glazing structures constructed by joining the edge portions of a plural ity of glazing sheets 1a, 1b by a sealant 5 through spacers 2 incorporating an adsorbent 6 because of the inability of the adsorbent effectively to adsorb water vapor and organic solvent vapor which has evaporated from the sealant, and pre vent dew deposition on the glass surfaces. These difficulties are now overcome by an adsorbent 6 comprising a granular zeolite 11 composed of a core 12 of a synthetic zeolite clay binder mixture containing the synthetic zeolite in a proportion larger than its average content in the granular zeolite and a shell 13 of a synthetic zeolite clay binder mixture containing the clay in a proportion larger than its average content in the granular zeolite, and granular activated carbon 15 having on its surface 1 to 20 by weight, based on the activated carbon 15 , of coating 16 of a synthetic resin latex.
