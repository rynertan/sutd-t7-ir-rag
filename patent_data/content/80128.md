An improved apparatus for guiding a corrugated card board sheet in a machine for making a box thereof com prises a plurality of bearing means supporting rolls which define a path of travel for a corrugated cardboard sheet. The bearing means are eccentric relative to the rolls, and rotat able to displace the rolls vertically, depending on the thick ness of the sheet. A plurality of sheet guide means are disposed along the path of sheet travel, and vertically dis placeable simultaneously with the rolls. A pair of longitudi nal brackets extend in parallel to the path of sheet travel. The guide means are secured to those brackets, and the rolls are rotatably supported by the brackets. The brackets are vertically displaceable upon rotation of the bearing means. Rotatable means are provided for rotating the bear ing means.
