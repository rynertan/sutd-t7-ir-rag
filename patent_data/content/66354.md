# Heat recovery process and apparatus.

## Abstract
A process for the recovery of heat from the gas leaving a unit for the thermal hydrogenation of an oil feedstock, which process comprises quenching the gas with a quench liquid in a quenching zone in which all the internal surfaces thereof are irrigated by the quench liquid and passing the cooled gas and quench liquid to a heat recovery unit in which all the surfaces thereof in contact with gas are irrigated by the quench liquid. The process is particularly suitable for the recovery of heat from the gas leaving a fluidised bed hydrogenator.
