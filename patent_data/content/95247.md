# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING AN INFORMATION SIGNAL, WITH A CONTROL TRACK, ON A RECORD MEDIUM

## Abstract
A digital video tape recorder VTR for use with an NTSC, PAL or SECAM television signal includes a reference signal generating circuit which generates a reference signal having a frequency of 13.5 MHz a first frequency dividing circuit having a dividing ratio of 1 45045 for frequency dividing the reference signal to produce a control signal for use with an NTSC television signal a second frequency dividing circuit having a dividing ratio of 1 45000 for frequency dividing the reference signal to produce a different control signal for use with a PAL or SECAM television signal a switch which supplies the control signal from the first frequency dividing circuit to a magnetic recording head for recording the control signal at the lower edge of a magnetic tape for each of successive, parallel tracks extending obliquely on the magnetic tape in which a television signal is recorded and a discriminator circuit which detects whether the television signal to be recorded is an NTSC television signal or a PAL or SECAM television signal and controls the switch to supply the control signal from the first frequency dividing circuit to the magnetic recording head when the discriminator circuit detects that the television signal to be recorded is an NTSC television signal and controls the switch to supply the control signal from the second frequency dividing circuit to the magnetic recording head when the discriminator circuit detects that the television signal to be recorded is a PAL or SECAM television signal.
