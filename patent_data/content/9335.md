# Fluidic flow control.

## Abstract
For achieving a shut off function, a mainstream com municates with a control stream into which an outlet 11 for the mainstream opens laterally. By reciprocating the control stream back and forth across the outlet 11 , for example by alternate pressurisation of reservoirs 18, 19 to which the control stream is connected at its ends, access of the mainstream to the outlet 11 is inhibited. When the reciprocation is discontinued full flow of the mainstream to or through the outlet 11 can take place.
