## Description
This invention relates to 8 chlorodibenz b,f 1,4 oxazepine 10 11H carboxylic acid, 2 sulfinyl and sulfonyl containing acyl hydrazides that are useful pharmacological agents. These compounds are prostaglandin antagonists having analgesic activity. Analgesics are agents used in the treatment of pain and often are useful in alleviating inflammation. The major classes of analgesics include narcotic analgesics or opiates and analgesic antipyretics such as the salicylates. Although the efficacy of opiates in relieving pain is well established, the associated addiction liability is a distinct disadvantage. Although salicylate and salicylate like agents non steroidal antiinflammatory agents are also efficacious in reliving pain, they often exhibit undesirable side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation as with aspirin , allergic response as with aspirin , or liver toxicity with extended use as with acetaminophen . The compounds included in this invention are neither opiates nor salicylates and may be expected not to exhibit the disadvantages of either class of compound. The closest prior art discloses compounds of the following formula, wherein group B is carbonyl CO or sulfonyl SO₂ and wherein A may be alkyl or substituted alkyl. The prior art does not, however, disclose nor anticipate the compounds of this invention. More specifically, U.S. Patent 3,534,019 discloses compounds in which B and A together constitute lower alkanoyl, and U.S. Patent 3,989,719 discloses compounds in which B and A together constitute higher alkanoyl. Thus, U.S. Patents 019 and 719 each disclose compounds in which A is a hydrocarbon. The sulfoxide and sulfone containing compounds of this invention are not disclosed. U.S. Patents 4,045,442, 4,125,532 division of 442 , and 4,170,593 division of 532 disclose compounds in which B is carbonyl and A is substituted amino alkyl. The sulfur containing compounds of this invention are not disclosed. U.S. Patents 3,917,649 and 3,992,375 division of 649 disclose compounds in which B is carbonyl or sulfonyl where B is carbonyl, A may be haloalkyl, alkenyl, or aryloxyalkyl and where B is sulfonyl, A may be alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, or aralkyl. U.S. Patents 649 and 375 thus disclose compounds in which a sulfonyl group must be attached directly to a hydrazine nitrogen, but do not disclose compounds in which B is carbonyl and A contains sulfoxide or sulfone groups. Thus, the compounds of this invention are structurally distinct from the prior art. This invention relates to compounds of Formula I inclusive and Examples of alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, inclusive, are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the isomeric forms thereof, generally referred to as lower alkyl. The componds of this invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the following Schemes. Unless otherwise specified, the various substituents are defined as for Formula I, above. Scheme A illustrates the preparation of sulfur containing intermediates of Formula IV Formula I in which X is S . The sulfur containing intermediates of Formula IV are novel compounds. Compounds of Formula IV are prepared by at least two different routes from 8 chloro 10,11 dihydrodibenz b,f 1,4 oxazepine 10 carboxylic acid hydrazide Formula II , the preparation of which is described in U.S. Pat. 3,534,019. In the first route, described in U.S. Pat. 4,045,442, the hydrazide of Formula II is acylated to give intermediates of Formula III. The preferred leaving group Y is a chlorine atom. Intermediates of Formula III may be converted to intermediates of Formula IV by several methods. For example, a preferred method involves an initial reaction with an alkali metal hydrosulfide, followed by alkylation of the intermediate In a second route used to prepare intermediates III, the hydrazide of Formula II is acylated wth appropriate acyl halides of Formula V in the presence of a base. Preferred acylating conditions include reaction of the hydrazide Formula II and an acyl chloride Formula V, Z C1 in an unreactive organic solvent, such as dichloromethane, containing a tertiary amine such as triethylamine. The acyl halides may be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as illustrated in the Preparations below. Scheme B illustrates the preparation of sulfoxides of this invention, Formula VI Formula I in which X is SO , and sulfones of this invention, Formula VII Formula I in which X Compounds of Formulas VI and VII are each prepared by oxidizing intermediates of Formula IV, preferably using a peroxycarboxylic acid in a cooled solvent. Careful control of Sulfones VII may be prepared by two general methods. First, intermediates IV may be oxidized directly to sulfones VII. Preferred conditions for such a direct oxidation are similar to those described above for the corresponding sulfoxides VI, except that a two fold molar quantity of The preferred embodiments of this invention, as indicated by biological activity in the following assays, are compounds according to Formula I wherein X is SO₂. The most preferred embodiment of this invention is a compound according to Formula I wherein X is SO₂, R is ethyl, and n is 2 exemplified in Example 10 below . The compounds are prostaglandin E₂ antagonists, as indicated by a guinea pig ileum assay performed essentially as described by J. H, Sanner, Female albino guinea pigs weighing 200 to 500 grams were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The ileum was quickly removed and placed in a modified Tyrode solution containing one half the usual amount of magnesium ions. Segments of ileum about 2 cm long were cut and mounted in a 2 or 4 ml tissue bath containing the modified Tyrode solution, and the solution was maintained at 37 and aerated with a gaseous mixture of 95 oxygen and 5 carbon dioxide. Contractions were detected isotonically. Submaximal contractions were obtained by adjusting the dose of prostaglandin E₂ PGE₂ added to the bath. Two control contractions were obtained at 3.5 minute intervals. A solution or suspension of the test compound in the bathing solution was then substituted for the original modified Tyrode solution. The test suspension was kept in constant contact with the tissue for the remainder of the experiment, except for brief periods to drain the bath in preparation for rinsing with fresh test suspension. Three more contractions were elicited for the PGE₂ agonist in the presence of the test compound without interrupting the time sequence. The last two sets of treated responses were compared with the two sets of control responses. The first set of treated responses was not used for comparisons, being used only to maintain the timed sequence of injections during the period allowed for the tissue to become equilibrated with the antagonist. A compound was rated active if the mean of contractions produced by the agonist was reduced 75 or more by the test compound. Male Charles River albino mice CD 1 ICR BR weighing 20 to 30 grams were used in this assay. Thirty minutes after subcutaneous or intragastric administration 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight or fifteen minutes after intracerebroventricular administration 5 mcl total volume , a 0.025 solution of phenylbenzoquinone PBQ was injected intraperitoneally 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight . Five minutes later each mouse was placed in a glass beaker and the number of writhes occurring in the next ten minutes was counted. A writhe consists of dorsoflexion of the back, extension of the hindlimbs, and strong contraction of the abdominal musculature. The test compound was considered to have produced analgesia in a mouse if the number of writhes elecited by PBQ was equal to or less than one half the median number of writhes recorded for the saline treated control group of mice that day. Results were expressed as the number of mice out of a possible ten in which the test compond produced analgesia. If the initial screening dose of 10 mg kg inhibited writhing in greater than six of ten mice, the effect of additional doses of the compound on the writhing response was evaluated and an ED₅₀ was calculated. By virtue of their analgesic activity, the compounds of Formula I are useful in treating pain in mammals.
