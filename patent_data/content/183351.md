# Implantable medical infusion system.

## Abstract
An implantable medication delivery system comprising an implantable unit 3 with a refillable reservoir 4 , a catheter connected thereto, and a pumping mechanism 8 activated by a microcomputer or microprocessor for pump ing medication from the reservoir 4 though the catheter into the body. The implantable medication unit 3 receives information and control commands via a telemetry link from an external controller unit 1 having a microprocessor. The external controller 1 receives feedback in the form of intermittent sampling of blood using enzyme strips 2 and a feflectance meter and or additional sensor s 3 which measure s physiological parameter s such as heart rate or blood pressure or temperature or skin resistivity. The feedback information is processed by the external unit 1 in accordance with a mathematical model of the patient and the relevant parameters are transmitted to the implanted unit 3 which adjusts its delivery profile according to a prescribed algorithm. The external unit 1 can also detect an alarm condition and take appropriate steps, e.g. abort infusion.
