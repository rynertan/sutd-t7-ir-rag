# Humidity variation detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to an apparatus capable of stably detecting humidity. More particularly, to stably detect the humidity in the atmosphere where temperature, relative humidity or wind flow vary, this humidity detecting apparatus converts the resistance variation, due to humidity, of a humidity sensing resistor 1 into voltage variation to draw out the voltage variation thereby to differentiate the voltage variation with a differentiation circuit 5 and thereafter to compare the differentiation output with a set value. Therefore, the steam leakage from the high pressure, high temperature steam, supply pipe or the relative humidity inside a mic rowave oven can be easily, automatically detected.
