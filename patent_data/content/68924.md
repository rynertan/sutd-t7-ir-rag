# Fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump 100 including a plunger 2 and a piston 1 movably disposed in a pumping chamber 17 , means for initiating 3, 5 fuel injection and means for terminating 13, 30, 29 fuel injection, the plunger periodi cally pressurizing fuel in a pressure chamber 44 and the piston 1 spaced from the plunger and allowing a metering chamber 16 to fill with a metered quantity of fuel to be injected to an engine. The means for initiating injection comprise a pilot valve 5 having a solenoid to selectively operate between either of two states and a spool valve 3 movable between first and second positions in response to the state of pilot valve 5 , the first position filling the metering chamber with the metered quantity of fuel. The pilot valve 5 determines the fuel quantity to be delivered to the engine relative to a signal from an electronic controller. An accumulator 4 is pressurized during each cycle of the plunger to provide pressurized fuel during a metering phase. A variable orifice 15 adjusts the rate of flow during the time fuel is being metered to metering chamber 16 .
