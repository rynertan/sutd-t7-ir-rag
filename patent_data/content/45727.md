# A device for electrically connecting power conductors and heating conductors in an electrically heated glass sheet.

## Abstract
A device for electrically connecting the source of electric power and conductors of a defroster for rear window in automobiles, comprising a plate to be welded on the collector of the defroster and a tail for connection to the power source, staggered with respect to the plane of the plate and having a portion of reduced transversal section. The plate is provided with holes and recesses which allow a welded connection with the conductor, so as to withstand stresses due to deformation possibly caused during the operation of assembling the electrical connections.
