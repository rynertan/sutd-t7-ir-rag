## Description
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkali metal fluotitanates by fluorination of a titanium ore and reac tion with an alkali metal compound, precipitation and separation of the alkali metal fluotitanates formed. Such a process is known from US patent No. 4,390,365. In this known process fluorination of titanium ore is effected by contacting the titanium ore with sodium fluosilicate at a temperature of 600 1000 C. A drawback of said process is that very high temperatures are required for fluorination, which of course entails a very high energy consumption. In addition, the high temperatures necessitate use of advanced equipment for which highly corrosion resistant materials are to be applied. The object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of alkali metal fluotitanates in which the digestion of the titanium ore is effected at lower temperatures, as a result of which the above mentioned drawbacks are not or hardly encountered. According to the invention this is achieved in that the tita nium ore is mixed with a hydrofluosilicate solution and the resulting suspension is evaporated at a temperature of 90 110 C, the residue is subsequently taken up in water or in a mineral acid and the residue solution is neutralized by means of an alkali metal compound. Suitable alkali metal compounds are an alkali metal carbonate or an alkali metal hydroxide, in the solid state or in solution. As titanium ore, in principle all ores containing titanium can be used, for instance rutile or ilmenite. The concentration of the hydrofluosilicate solution is not critical. Preferably a 15 36 wt. hydrofluosilicate solution is started from. Such a solution can be obtained by diluting or concentrating industrial hydrofluosilicate solutions, which are obtained as bypro duct by scrubbing of silicon and fluorine containing off gases from a phosphate digestion and or an evaporation section of a wet process phosphoric acid production unit. The suspension wil generally contain 5 20 wt. titanium, calculated as the amount of titanium dioxide relative to the amount of hydrofluosilicate. In the neutralization of the residue solution such an amount of the alkali metal compound is added as to result in complete preci pitation df the alkali metal fluotitanate. This corresponds with a pH value between 3 and 5. Impurities in the titanium ore that, as such or after forming compounds, are present as insoluble material in the residue solution, can if necessary be separated before neutralization, for instance by filtration or centrifuging. For process economical and environmental reasons it is impor tant for the gaseous hydrofluoride and silicon tetrafluoride released on digestion of the titanium ore to be kept in the system and to be recycled. It is preferred to do this by absorbing the hydrofluoride and silicon tetrafluoride released in water or in a hydrofluosilicate solution using known techniques. There is advantage in using water as solvent for the residue, as this will result in the lowest impurity content of the final pro duct, while less alkali metal salts need to be drained. If a titanium ore containing few impurities and admixtures is started from, such as rutile, a potassium compound is preferably applied as alkali metal compound. This has the advantage that, because of its low water solubility, the formed potassium fluotitanate is immediately precipitated, following which it can be separated, for instance by filtering or centrifuging. If an impure titanium ore is used, there is advantage in applying a sodium compound as alkali metal compound. The sodium fluotitanate, which is fairly soluble, remains dissolved and the pre cipitated impurities can be separated. If an ore with a high bivalent iron content is used, for instance ilmenite, the iron in the solution can be oxidized using, for instance, atmospheric oxygen, upon which it is precipitated as ferric hydroxide and can be separated. The solution containing sodium fluotitanate can subsequently be cooled or evaporated, resulting in precipitation of sodium fluoti tanate. However, this precipitate often is highly impure as impurities end up also in the precipitate on cooling or evaporating. Preferably a potassium salt is added to the sodium fluotitanate solution, without forced cooling or evaporation, as a result of which potassium fluoti tanate is precipitated, in a purer form. As is known, alkali metal fluotitanates are eminently suitable as starting material for the preparation of metallic titanium by the molten salt electrolysis method. The invention will now be elucidated with reference to the following example, without being limited to the embodiment described. In an open 2 litre polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE reaction vessel 65 g dried rutile ore is suspended in 1000 g of a 36 wt. hydrofluosilicate solution obtained as byproduct in a phosphoric acid process, use being made of a PTFE blade mixer. While being stirred, the vessel contents were evaporated to dryness in about 6 hours at 90 110 C. Indications of the end of the evaporation process were the absence of further SiF₄ mist formation and the increase in vessel tem perature to about 120C. At the end of fluorination 159 g viscous, turbis liquid remained. The residue was subsequently taken up in demineralized water until a total weight of 700 g was reached. Using a tubular centrifuge with PTFE tubes the insoluble material was separated, subsequently washed out with acetone and dried at 45 C. This resulted in 0.3 g precipitate 0.5 of feed . The clear filtrate was divided into two portions, A and B, having a weight of 330 and 362 g, respectively. To amount A, ground and chemically pure K₂CO₃ was dosed with proper stirring until a pH of 4 was reached in total 41.9 g K₂CO₃ . The resulting flocculent precipitate was separated by means of a Biichner filler and washed out with acetone. After drying at 45 C, 74.1 g dry matter remained. X ray diffraction analysis proved this to be potassium fluotitanate. Portion B was treated with a 50 KOH solution until a pH of 3 to 4 was reached. This corresponds with a dose of 37.2 g chemically pure KOH. Again the solid matter was separated, washed and dried at 45 C. The weight of the dry matter was 81.2 g. X ray diffraction analysis showed this to be potassium fluotitanate. On the basis of the TiO₂ content an overall efficiency was calculated 87 for the k₂₉
