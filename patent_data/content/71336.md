# Process for the chemical dissolution of oxide deposits.

## Abstract
A process for the chemical dissolution of oxide deposits containing a proportion of chromium and in particular for the chemical decontamination of oxide deposits contaminated with activated species as hereinbefore defined which process comprises treating the oxide deposit sequentially with i a permanganate salt in acid solution to remove chromium therefrom as hexavalent chromium. ii a reducing agent in acid solution to destroy excess permanganate ions and manganese dioxide formed by reduction of the permanganate and iii a mixture of a reducing agent and complexing acid to dissolve the residual chromium depleted oxide.
