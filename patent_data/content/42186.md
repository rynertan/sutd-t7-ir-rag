## Description
A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE POSITION OF AN INTERFACE BETWEEN DIFFERENT MATERIALS BY FREQUENCY DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for measuring the position of an interface between different materials by frequency domain reflectometry. There are many devices which are presently available for measuring the interface positions between two or more different materials. Such devices may be used for example to determine the level of a material being present in a vessel or container. Various techniques are known to provide such level or interface position measurements. One of these known techniques is the electrical transmission line technique. According to said technique a pair of electrodes, forming a transmission line, are partially immersed in a first material for example a liquid in a vessel or container. Above said first material a second material for example gas is present in the vessel or container. Electrical pulses are impressed on the electrodes by any suitable means and are propagated through the transmission line. These pulses are reflected partially from impedance discontinuities being present in the transmission line. Said discontinuities are introduced in the transmission line by interface levels between different materials for example liquid gas interfaces in a container or vessel as a result of differing dielectric constants of both materials. The propagation velocity of the pulses in the said second material for example gas is known and subsequently the liquid level can be determined from the transmission reflection time interval of a pulse impressed on the pair of electrodes. The location of the interface is determined by measuring the time interval between the generation of such pulse and the return of a reflection caused by the impedance change, where the transmission line passes through the interface. This technique is expensive and not particularly accurate, because the time measurement should be extremely precise. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a method and an apparatus for measuring the level of a material or position of an interface between different materials in a very accurate and cheap manner. It is another object of the invention to provide a selfcalibrating apparatus for level gauging which is applicable to a wide range of materials and comprises low cost electronics and an electrode assembly, that is robust and cheap to manufacture, because said electrodes do not need to be very accurately manufactured. It is still another object of the invention to provide an apparatus for leval gauging, using very little electrical power and low voltage, so that the apparatus can be made intrinsically safe against ignition hazards. It is still another object of the invention to provide an apparatus for level gauging, which is tolerant of changes and inhomogeneities of permittivity in the liquid and which is less sensitive to electrode fouling than known devices. The invention therefore comprises an apparatus for determining the position of an interface between different materials characterized by at least one transmission line consisting of a pair of electrodes, passing through said interface means adapted to generate a continuous oscillation through the transmission line, and comprising means for measuring the period of the continuous oscillation generated by said generating means. Further the invention comprises a method for determining the position of an interface between different materials, characterized by the steps of generating pulses through a transmission line consisting of a pair of electrodes, thus generating a continuous oscillation, measuring the period of the generated oscillation and deriving therefrom an indication of the position of said interface. The invention is based upon the observation of oscillation signals in the so called frequency domain and in particular upon measuring the period of a continuous oscillation generated by a suitable means for example an oscillator. The expression frequency domain is well known to those skilled in the art and will not be described in detail. In particular a tunnel diode can be used as an oscillator in a very advantageous manner. Its operation and voltage current characteristic are well known to those skilled in the art and will therefore not be described here in detail. For part of the characteristic the diode current falls with increasing voltage, so its differential resistance is negative.The diode is triggered by pulses of a predetermined amplitude which are reflected from any point, at which the impedance of the transmission line changes. After a suitable choice of the operating point of the tunnel diode the result is a continuous oscillation. It can be shown that the period of such an oscillation can be expressed as follows T 4 Li Co, wherein T oscillation period, L length of the transmission line being not immersed, i 8 velocity 1 Co velocity of propagation of the pulses W 3 x 108 ms 1. So, if only T is measured, L can already be derived from the above equation. This derivation may be obtained in any suitable way, for example by means of a digital processor. From the above equation it will be clear that L is given independent of s. e represents the permittivity of the liquid. The measurement of the said period T may for example be determined by comparison with the period of a known reference frequency. Such a reference frequency may be generated by any suitable means, for example a quarts crystal. The present invention will now be described by way of example in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which fig. 1 shows schematically the principle of an apparatus for level gauging according to the invention fig 2 shows an example of an embodiment of the level gauging apparatus according to the invention fig. 3 shows the upper part of the embodiment of fig 2 in more detail. With reference now to fig. 1 a.container or vessel 4 is shown, which may be any suitable storage tank or any other material containing vessel. The container 4 is filled with any suitable material for example a liquid 5 having a permittivity s. Above the liquid 5 a gas 5a is present. So a gas liquid interface 5b is present in the container 4. A probe consisting of a central electrode 2 of any suitable electrically conducting material is surrounded by a co axial conducting shield electrode 1. Said shield electrode is constructed of any suitable electrically conducting material and is spaced from the electrode 2 by suitable spacers not shown . Both co axial electrodes 1 and 2 form a transmission line of characteristic impedance Z in ohms above the liquid 0 surface. This impedance Z is dependent on the outer diameters 0 a and b of the electrodes 1 and 2, respectively.The probe is immersed in the liquid 5. The liquid must be in sufficiently close contact with the probe to substantially change the impedance of the transmission line at the point where it is immersed in the liquid. If the liquid has a permittivity then below the liquid surface a characteristic impedance of the transmission line Z1 Z C exists. This relation is known 0 to those skilled in the art and will not be explained further. Any means 6 suitable for the purpose at the exterior portion of the transmission line connects the central conductor electrode 2 of the transmission line to a tunnel diode 7. The tunnel diode is fed by any suitable direct current bias for example 0.1 volt not shown . The shield electrode 1 is connected by any suitable means to the ground not shown . The tunnel diode is connected by any suitable means 8. to a suitable electronic unit 3, which will be described with reference to fig. 2. As already described earlier, the tunnel diode emits signals through the transmission line until they reach a point at which an impedance change in the line exists and a portion of these signals travelling down to the liquid surface will be reflected from points of change of impedance of the transmission line with a certain reflection coefficient and will trigger the diode to generate a continuous oscillation. The period of the oscillation from the tunnel diode is determined by means of comparison with the known period of the frequency of a quartz crystal not shown . The remainder of the emitted signals continues to the end 6 of the transmission line to where it encounters a terminating resistance R matched to the impedance of the transmission line.It is known to those skilled in the art that at the end 6 the signals in the transmission line will not be reflected if the terminating resistance R equals Z1. Fig. 2 shows an example of an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The same reference numbers as in fig. 1 have been used. The terminating resistor R and the electronic unit 3 have been represented. The upper end 16, respectively lower end 16a, of the probe may be provided with vent holes 15, respectively 15a, to allow liquid to move between the conductors 1 and 2. The conductor 2 has not been shown in fig. 2 . The upper end 16 of the probe comprises the tunnel diode not shown . The probe is made 50 cm long, 3.5 cm outer diameter sections with screw couplings, so that any required number can be fitted together. The electronic unit 3 is connected to an indicator not shown by any means 9 suitable for the purpose. The indicator may be designed in such a way that a direct indication in either cm up to 100 m, or mm up to 10 m may be selected. A shunt zener safety barrier not shown may be interposed between the indicator and the gauge. Said electronic unit 3 amplifies the diode signal and divides the frequency by a suitable factor, for example one hundred. This may be done by any circuit suitable for the purpose not shown . Where the gauge frequency will be in the range of 1 NRz to 100 MHz, the transmitted frequency is in the range of 10 KHz to 1 MFIz, so that low cost cable can be used for transmission over long distances. The design of the apparatus is arranged so, that power may be applied along the same wire that transmits the level signal. Fig. 3 shows an enlarged view of the upper part 16 of the probe as represented in fig. 2. The inner conductor electrode 2 is supported at 50 cm intervals by groups of three polytetrafluorethylene fingers 10. The diode 7 is connected through suitable resistors 13 to the electronic unit 3. The diode is fitted into a support 11 through a helical spring 12. The diode is connected through a contact 13a and a line 14 to the circuits of the electronic unit 3 not shown . It will be appreciated that any other suitable embodiments of the probe are possible, for example the two conductors need not to be coaxial, but may consist of a pair of parallel wires.If desirable the conductors can be insulated without affecting the operating of the apparatus. In other configurations the container wall may form one side of the transmission line. In all cases, however, at least one conductor of the transmission line should be substantially surrounded by the material, the level of which is to be measured. The material must be in sufficient close contact to substantially change the impedance of the transmission line at the point where it is immersed in the said material. In most applications only one central indicator may be used for several level gauges. If one central indicator is used for several level gauges for each of said gauges a separate adjustment may be present, that allows the zero level to be aligned with a required datum, to compensate for any differences in the mechanical mounting or different diode switching speeds between the gauges. Further, it will be appreciated that any oscillation period measuring manner suitable for the purpose can be used. The period of the generated oscillation may for example be compared with the time base of an oscilloscope. The vessel or container may be filled with any material suitable for the purpose, such as salt water, fresh water, crude oils, products, liquefied gases and all manner of mixtures reacting, fermenting and separating, etc. It will be appreciated that the sections of the probe may have any length and diameter suitable for the purpose. Further, the diode may be fitted into the probe by any means suitable for the purpose. Various modifications of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.
