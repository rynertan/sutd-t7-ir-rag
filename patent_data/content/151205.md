# Continuous system for treating fabrics.

## Abstract
A continuous system applies chemical solutions to successive rolls of fabric from alternate applicators 8,9 . The treated rolls pass through a plurality of stations 2 to 5 within a common development chamber, emerging fully processed in one continuous movement. Radiant heat and steam are applied throughout the chamber and a winding and rewinding operation in station 4 provides uniform treatment. An inclined chamber section 5 permits gravity feed of the rolls.
