# Cis 6 undecene 1 chloride and a method for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A novel compound cis 6 undecene 1 chloride is pre pared by reacting cis 3 octene 1 chloride with metallic mag nesium to give a Grignard reagent of the chloride and then reacting the Grignard reagent with 1 bromo 3 chloropropane in the presence of a lithium copper chloride as a catalyst. The inventive compound is a useful intermediate compound for the synthetic preparation of sev eral kinds of so called sexual pheromone compounds of nox ious insects. As an example of such sexual pheromone com pounds, the synthetic preparation of cis 9 tetradecenyl ace tate is described.
