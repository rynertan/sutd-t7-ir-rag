# High pressure hydraulic system.

## Abstract
A high pressure hydraulic system, including a bidirectional fluid motor having two ports, a pair of normally closed, pilot operated poppet valves, each connected to an associated port, a fluid reservoir, a flow sensor having a flow path interconnecting each of the poppet valves and the reservoir and having an output for providing a signal representing the flow rate, along the flow path, a pair of metering valves each connected to the pilot of an associated poppet valve for controlling the flow of fluid through the associated poppet valve, control signal inputs for each of the metering valves, and flow rate signal inputs connected to the output of the flow sensor for each of the metering valves so that each poppet valve is ultimately controlled by both control signals and the flow rate through the flow sensor.
