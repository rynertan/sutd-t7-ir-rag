# NUMERICAL CONTROL PROCESS.

## Abstract
In ordinary operation, an interpolator 102 executes pulse operation according to the carry command from a command tape 101 so as to deliver distributed pulses XP, YP, ZP, BP and CP corresponding to all the axes of an orthogonal and spherical coordinate system, and then the pulses drive servo motors 113 to 117 through servo circuits 108 to 112 , respectively. In manual operation, in order to maintain a constant relative position between the top of a tool and a work, a manual pulse generator 103 generates manual pulses of B axis or C axis direction after positioning the supporting member of the tool in the orthogonal coordinate system, and then distributed pulses BP, CP are produced at an interpolator 102 to drive servo motors 116 and 117 . Simultaneously, the distributed pulses are fed to a correcting circuit 104 , which calculates correction amounts for the X, Y and Z axes and produces correcting pulses XHP, YHP and ZHP, and then the correcting pulses are added to the distributed pulses to drive the servo motors.
