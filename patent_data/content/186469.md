# LOGIC DEVICES

## Abstract
A logic circuit comprising a programmed memory device 7 which has one or more data outputs D0 D2 cross connected to one or more corresponding address inputs A2 A4 , data programmed in the memory 7 is arranged to cause the memory device 7 to self address through at least one transient state before taking up a stable state. Inclusion of a delay 6 in a cross connection lengthens the period of the transient state. The specification discloses logic devices having cross connected outputs and inputs and adapted for use as logic gates, pattern generators, oscillators and frequency dividers.
