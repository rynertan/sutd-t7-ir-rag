# Process for capture and storage of light energy by endoergic isomerizations.

## Abstract
A process is provided for the capture and storage of radiant energy in highly strained carbon containing ring structures of isomerizable compounds. The process compris es exposing a photocatalyst to said radiant energy in the presence of a reversibly isomerizable carbon containing compound, wherein said photocatalyst contains a com pound of a metal selected from Re, Ir, Rh, Ru, Os, Pt and Pd and mixtures thereof and wherein said isomerizable com pound is capable of forming an intramolecular strained carbon containing ring structure. A representative photocatalyst is ClRe CO ₃ 4 phenylpyridine ₂.
