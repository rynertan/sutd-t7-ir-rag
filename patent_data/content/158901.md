## Description
The present invention relates to a rotating member supporting apparatus, and more specifically to a supporting apparatus for supporting a rotating member used in a corrosive environment, e.g., a melting furnace for alloy casting, molten metal plating bath, or electroplating bath. A conventional melting furnace used in a casting process for aluminum based alloy or the like, for example, is found on page 11 of the April 1980 issue of the Kinzoku Japanese trade magazine from Agune Co., Ltd. . According to this melting furnace, a fixed shaft extends from the outside of the furnace into a molten alloy in the furnace, and a rotating cylinder with blades at one end thereof is mounted on the fixed shaft with the aid of a bearing. The blades serve to stir the molten alloy for homogenization. In the melting furnace of this type, however, the rotating blades are placed in the molten alloy, so that the bearing is located in the molten metal if it is disposed between the rotating cylinder and the fixed shaft. Thus, the bearing is left in a corrosive environment, resulting in early stage decay. Conventionally, therefore, the other end portion of the rotating cylinder extends upward to be located above the surface level of the molten alloy, and the bearing rotatably supports the extended end portion of the rotating cylinder on the fixed shaft. As a result, the distance between those portions of the rotating cylinder corresponding to the bearing and the blades is extended, and the rotating cylinder is shaped like a cantilever supported by the bearing. With this arrangement, the blades whirl while they are rotating, so that stirring efficiency is too low for the molten alloy to be easily homogenized. For the electroplating bath, a vertical plating bath is generally known which is stated in the Comprehensive Bibliography of Iron Making Machines Equipment, 1977 issued on November 25, 1976, by Jukogyo Shinbun Publishing Co. . According to this plating bath, a steel plate is guided by a conductor roller and a hold down roller outside the electroplating bath and a sink roller disposed in an electrolyte in the plating bath. Thus, the surface of the steel plate is plated when the steel plate is energized by a current flowing between an anode bar in the electrolyte and the conductor roller as a cathode. Both end portions of a supporting shaft of the sink roller are fitted in bores in a supporting member at the top end portion of the plating bath. Since the sink roller is rotated at high speed, a bearing is disposed between the roller supporting shaft and the supporting member to protect them against wear. In this electroplating bath, the sink roller is located in the electrolyte, so that the sink roller and the bearing are always subjected to a corrosive environment. Various measures have conventionally been taken to counter corrosion of the sink roller, including improvement of material. However, no special consideration has been given to the protection of the bearing against corrosion. Therefore, the bearing would possibly be disabled by corrosion in an early stage of use. If the bearing malfunctions, the electroplating apparatus will have to be stopped for the replacement of the bearing, greatly lowering its working efficiency. US A 3 969 125 discloses a heat resistive and reinforced composite material as a substitute of cermet for machine parts which require good heat resistivity and mechanical strength at high temperatures. Furthermore, such material shall be used for making molten metal vessels because of its excellent corrosion resistivity to molten metals. Said material is prepared by sintering a finely powdered mixture of trisilicon tetranitride and an oxide of yttrium elements. More improved similar composite material having excellent bending strength shall be obtained by sintering a finely powdered mixture of trisilicontetranitride, yttrium oxide and aluminium oxide. Cerium oxide, lanthanum oxide or scandium oxide can also be used instead of yttrium oxide. EP A 0 100 380 discloses plastic deformation tools for use in pipe drawing, wire drawing, rod rolling, sheet rolling, extrusion and die casting of metals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc, tin, nickel, cobalt, titanium etc. and alloys thereof. The material for such tools consists of a sintered compact mainly composed of silicon nitride admixed with oxide, carbide, nitride, boride or silicide of yttrium and aluminum, aluminum oxide or aluminum nitride. Furthermore, MACHINE DESIGN , Vol. 51, No. 5, March 8, 1979 discloses a rotating member supporting apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. It suggests the use of magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide or the like as assistant for sintering ceramics. The most commonly used assistant shall be magnesium oxide. It has, however, be found by experiments that rolling bearings made of silicon nitride, wherein magnesium oxide is used as sintering assistant, have only poor rolling ability and can hardly be put to practical use. Furthermore, although it is referred to yttrium oxide, there is only suggested the possibility of using yttrium oxide as sintering assistant together with aluminum oxide. There are no experimental data on ceramic bearings made of silicon nitride, in which yttrium oxide has been added as sintering assistant. The present invention is contrived in consideration of these circumstances, and is intended to provide a rotating member supporting apparatus highly resistant to heat and corrosion and adapted for use in a corrosive environment. The above object is achieved by a rotating member supporting apparatus as defined by claim 1. A preferred embodiment of the apparatus is characterized in that said inner and outer rings are each formed of a metal ring coated with a corrosion resisting film on the entire surface. Said corrosion resisting film is preferably formed of carbide of vanadium or compound of chromium. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taking in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which One embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing. As shown in the drawing, a supporting apparatus is provided with a rotating shaft 10 as an inner member which is used in a corrosive environment. An end portion of the rotating shaft 10 is inserted in a bore 14 which is formed in a supporting member 12 as an outer member. A narrower stepped portion 16 is formed on the end portion of the rotating shaft 10, while a wider stepped portion 18 is formed on the inner peripheral surface of the bore 14, facing the stepped portion 16. A rolling bearing 20 is interposed between the rotating shaft 10 and the inner peripheral surface of the bore 14, whereby the rotating shaft 10 is rotatably supported. The rolling bearing 20 includes an inner ring 22 and an outer ring 24 which are resistant to both heat and corrosion. The inner ring 22 is fitted on the outer peripheral surface of the narrower stepped portion 16 so as to abut against a shoulder portion 25 of the rotating shaft 10, and is prevented from slipping off the rotating shaft 10 by a locating snap ring 30 which is fitted on the rotating shaft 10. The outer ring 24 is fitted in the wider stepped portion 18 of the bore 14 so as to abut against a shoulder portion 26 of the bore 14, facing the inner ring 22. The outer ring 24 is prevented from slipping off the bore 14 by a fixing sleeve 32 which is fitted in the bore 14. The inner ring 22 is formed of a ring shaped raceway track portion 22a and rib portions 22b and 22c which are integrally formed at either end of the raceway track portion 22a so as to project radially outward. The outer ring 24 consists of a ring shaped raceway track portion 24a, a separately formed rib portion 24b located at one end of the raceway track portion 24a on the side of the shoulder portion 26 so as to project radially inward, and a rib portion 24c integrally formed at the other end of the raceway track portion 24a so as to project radially inward. A plurality of cylindrical rollers 28 made of heat and corrosion resisting ceramic material are arranged in an annular space defined between the respective raceway track portions 22a and 24a of the inner and outer rings 22 and 24. The cylindrical rollers 28 can roll on the outer peripheral surface of the raceway track portion 22a and the inner peripheral surface of the raceway track portion 24a. In rolling action, the cylindrical rollers 28 are guided by the respective inside faces of the rib portions 22b and 22c of the inner ring 22 and the rib portions 24b and 24c of the outer ring 24. Corner portions defined by the raceway track portions 22a and 24a and the rib portions 22b, 22c, 24b and 24c have no grinding undercuts as are provided for conventional bearings, and have a radius of curvature substantially equal to or a little smaller than that of the roller chamfers on the end edges of the cylindrical rollers 28. The cylindrical rollers 28 may be kept at regular intervals along the circumferential direction of the inner ring 22 by a cage not shown . In this case, the cage is naturally formed from heat and corrosion resisting material, such as stainless steel. Considering the life of the rolling bearing, the ceramic material for the cylindrical rollers 28 should be silicon nitride, which is formed by a pressure sintering method, such as a hot pressing process, hot isostatic pressing process, or ambient pressure sintering process. The sintered compact of silicon nitride is admixed with oxides of rare earth elements as sintering assistants, namely yttria, and aluminum oxide, preferably at an addition rate of 10 for each. Moreover, the degree of sintering is effectively improved by adding, preferably 10 or less, aluminum nitride or a suitable amount of, preferably 5 or less, titanium oxide. When the supporting apparatus of this embodiment is used in a corrosive environment at a relatively low temperature, e.g., in a melting furnace or electroplating bath for lead or zinc based alloy, it is necessary only that the cylindrical rollers 28 alone be formed from ceramic material. In other words, the inner and outer rings 22 and 24 may be formed from stainless steel or other corrosion resisting metal, since the environment is not very corrosive. When using the supporting apparatus in a highly corrosive environment irrespective of temperature, e.g., in a melting furnace or electroplating bath for aluminum based alloy, however, the inner and outer rings 22 and 24, as well as the cylindrical rollers 28, should preferably be formed from ceramic material. When the supporting apparatus is used in a zinc based alloy melting furnace, for example, the inner and outer rings 22 and 24 may be formed from conventional bearing steel coated with a corrosion resisting film, such as carbide of vanadium or compound of chromium, for example Cr₂O₃. The ceramic material used for the inner and outer rings 22 and 24 is identical with that for the cylindrical rollers 28. When the ceramic inner and outer rings are used, the inner ring 22 is fitted on the rotating shaft 10 by a proper clearance fit, while the outer ring 24 is set in the bore 14 in the supporting member 12 by a transition fit. This is done because ceramics are lower in thermal expansion coefficient than metals, and are more resistant to compressive force but less resistant to tensile force. If the inner ring 22 should be tightly fit on the rotating shaft 10, it would possibly be damaged by a radial tensile force caused by thermal expansion of the rotating shaft 10 during use. It is to be desired therefore that the inner ring 22 and the rotating shaft 10 should be coupled by a clearance fit. On the other hand, if the outer ring 24 is fitted more tightly in the bore 14 of the supporting member 12, the fit will be able to be maintained more satisfactorily in proportion after thermal expansion of the supporting member 12 during use. In practice, however, the outer ring 24, made of fragile ceramic material, may possibly be broken when it is pressed in the bore 14. Accordingly, the outer ring 24 is preferably set in place by a transition fit which permits minimization of the influences of the fitting force and the thermal expansion of the supporting member 12. If only the cylindrical rollers 28 are formed from ceramic material, the influences of the thermal expansion of the rotating shaft 10 and the supporting member 12 will be able to be avoided. In the embodiment described above, the inner member serves as the rotating member 10, and the outer member as the supporting member 12 supporting the rotating member 10. Alternatively, the inner and outer members may be constructed as a supporting shaft and a rotating member supported by the supporting shaft, respectively. In other words, it is necessary only that the inner and outer members 10 and 12 be coupled for relative rotation so that one of them serves as a rotating member and the other as a nonrotating member for supporting the rotating member. Here it is to be understood that the manner of arrangement of the rolling bearing according to the above embodiment may also be applied to the case where the inner and outer members constitute the supporting shaft and the rotating member, respectively. According to the rotating member supporting apparatus constructed in this manner, at least the rolling elements of the rolling bearing are made of ceramic material, while the inner and outer rings are formed of material resistant to heat and corrosion, e.g., metal coated with a corrosion resisting film such as carbide of vanadium or compound of chromium, or ceramic material, as required. Thus, the supporting apparatus of the present invention is higher in heat and corrosion resistance than a prior art counterpart, and can avoid damage to the bearing by corrosion even when used in a corrosive environment at high or low temperature, thereby prolonging the life of the bearing. When the above described supporting apparatus is used in, for example, a melting furnace, the inner member 10 serves as a fixed shaft, while the outer member 12 constitutes a rotating cylinder rotatably supported on the fixed shaft. The outer member 12 is fitted with blades for stirring the molten metal. Since the supporting apparatus is highly resistant to corrosion, the rotating cylinder need not be extended above the surface level of the molten metal, and the rotating cylinder and the blades can be supported on substantially the same level by the bearing. Thus, the blades can rotate with less whirling action, and the stirring efficiency is improved for the ease of homogenization of the molten metal. When the supporting apparatus is used in an electroplating bath, the inner and outer members 10 and 12 constitute a rotating roller and a supporting member for supporting the same, respectively. In this case, the outer member 12 and the bearing 20 are provided at each end of the rotating roller. When the supporting apparatus is thus applied to the electroplating bath, the life of the bearing can be longer, permitting reduction of the frequency of its replacement. Thus, time loss attributed to the replacement of the bearing can greatly be reduced for improved working efficiency of the plating apparatus.
