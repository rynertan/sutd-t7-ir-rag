## Description
BUCKET W EL UNLOADERS ESP CIALLY FOR C IPS This invention relates to unloading apparatus for discharging bulk materials in particulate form, such as from a ship s hold, e.g. for off loading a dredger. Unloading bulk material fro a hold using cranemounted grabs is a very time consuming operation, and such grabs require the continuous exercise of skill and judgement bg the crane operator. They also involve high maintenance costs and heavy wear and tear both for the equipment and the ship itself. Drag scrapers similarly suffer the disadvantages of high maintenance costs and excessive wear and tear. Various forms of bucket unloader have also been proposed, These unloaders are usually shore mounted, and one example can be seen in US 3 362 546. Theses however, pose other problems.The vessel must be aligned correctly with the shore mounted equipment, which is particularly difficult for larger vessels, and the relative positions of the vessel and the unloading equipment have to be maintained, which may not be possible in tidal waters. Also, although the vessel avoids the weight penalty involved in carrying its own unloading equipment, this saving can quickly be offset by the greatly increased capital cost of providing a large number of unloading installations at alternative sites. Ship mounted bucket unloaders are also known, as in UK 1 385 805 and 1 369 418, but they have their own problems. Oontinuous bucket chains may rot only be subject to the same lisadvantages as drag scrapers but they are also susceptible ro 3 jamming o t unloader if the material in the hold caves in W on is and thereby imposes a load that the machine drive cannot work against. Another form of bucket unloader has been proposed in UK 1 528 088 in zilch a bucket wheel apparatus is driven from a fixed installation into the hold of a ship to unload that hold, but this arrangement is subject to the problems of the known shore mounted installations as well as the knoTni ship mounted installations. It is an object of the present invention to provide a form of unloading apparatus that can be employed effectively as a ship mounted installation although the scope of the invention is not necessarily limited thus. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a bucket wheel unloader comprising a carriage having a pivot mounting for an elongate boom, and a bucket wheel mounted on the boom remote from its pivot mounting to be upwardly and downwardly adjustable by movement of the boom about its pivot, the carriage being arranged to progress along a bulk material storage space and the bucket wheel being rotatable in a plane transverse to the direction of movement of the carriage to transfer material from said space onto conveying means extending along the boom as the carriage moves along said space, for said material tb be carried by the boom conveying means to off loading means. In an apparatus of tis form, the detth of penetration of the bucket wheel into the material can be limited by control cf the luffing angle of the boo on its pivot mounting so as to avoid too great a depth of penetration. moreover, the orientatl on of the bucket wheel so that it rotates in a plane transverse to the direction of displacement of the carriage while it depth of penetration is so controlled, means that the volume swept by the bucket wheel leaves the remaining material in the. space with its top face having sides so sloped that slippage of any large amount of material can be avoided.If it is possible to adopt an arrangement in which the diameter of the wheel is very nearly equal to the width of the storage space, the danger of jamming the wheel in slipped material can be avoided without it being necessary tO traverse the wheel laterally of the space. Thus, according to a preferred form of the invention there is provided a ship having an elongate hold for bulk material and provided with a bucket wheel unloader for said material comprising a carriage mounted over tne hold and movable longitudinally of the hold, a boom pivotally supported on the carriage to be adjustably lowered into the hold, a bucket wheel on the boom remote from its pivot mounting being rotatable in a plane transverse to the direction of carriage displacement, said bucket wheel having a diameter that extends across the major part of the Tidth of the hold, rotation of the bucket wheel as the carriage is progressed along the hold being arranged to transfer material from the hold for off loading by way of conveying means extending along the boom. The bottoti of tie hold preferably has a transverse profile corresponding approximately to the transverse profile the be er part of the wheel when it is lowered on the boom to adjacent the bottom of the hold. The invention will be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying diagrsmmatic drawings, which illustrate a bucket wheel unloader according to the invention mounted on an ocean going dredger for the discharge of the material accumulated in the ship s hold.In the drawings Fig. 1 is a side view of the unloader in a stowed position adjacent the forward end of the ship s hold Fig. 2 is a plan view of the unloader in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a schematic end view showing some details of the unloader of Figs. 1 and 2, and illustrating also in outline the transverse profile of the hold Fig. 4 is a schematic side view illustrating a modification of the unloader of the preceding figures and Fig. 5 is a schematic plan view of a further modified form of unloader. The unloader illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3 comprises a carriage 2 mounted on rails 4 that run along the deck D of the ship, on the coamlngs on opposite sides of a cargo hold It not indicated in det il that extends uninterruptedly over a conniderable part of the length of the hull. The carriage is a generally U form structure with two elongate side members 2a joined at their forand end by a transverse member 2b, in the manner of a portal frame. rigid boom 6, having a lattice or other structure, is provided with a horizontal transverse divot mounting 8 at i is forward end to brackets 10 of the carriage. The boon extends centrally between the side members 2a and can be lufe ed about its pivot mounting by a cable drive to be described below.At the head of the boom, remote from the pivot mounting, a bucket wheel 12 is journalled on a longitudinally projecting support 14 extending from the end of the boon and can be lowered into the ships hold by the luffixip of the boom The axis of rotation of the bucket wheel is slightly inclined relative to the longitudinal axis of the boom, so that the bucket wheel is tilted upwards when the boom is horizontal, although both axes are disposed in a central vertical plane of the unloader. 3ulk material is picked up from the hold by the rotating bucket wheel as the carriage 2 is progressed along the It of the hold. A belt conveyor 16, mounted on the boom to project into the centre ofthe bucket wheel, receives material discharged from the buckets on the wheel. The other end of te boom conveyor overhangs a transverse conveyor 18 mounted on the carriage, and material transferred from the boom conveyor onto the transverse conveyor is in turn discharged onto a ship side belt conveyor 20 Fig. 3 mounted in a fixed position along the ship s deck and extending the length cf the cargo hold. From the conveyor 20 the material is discharged from the ship.For example, a further conveyor not shown can be provided to receive the material from the s side conveyor 20, this further conveyor being pivotable outwardly from the slftp, to discharge, e.g. onto a required swore locution. Power is fed to the unloader from the ship is electrical supply through a trailing cable and reeling drum 22. The carriage 2 is mounted on the rails 4 through bogies 0 adjacent the boom Pivot mounting and further rail wheels 32 at the further ends of the side members 2a. Guide wheels 34 Fig. 3 are also mounted on the carriage at each side of one of the rails 4 to retain the carriage laterally against side forces, e.g due to rolling of the ship. The carriage is driven by a static twin chain drive that comprises respective chains 36 at opposite sides of the hold, extending over tlength of travel of the carriage and anchored at their ends. Each chain is led through idler sprockets 38 on the carriage to a respective driving sprocket 40 driven by e.g.an automatically braked hydraulic motor 42. Both motors are driven simultaneously power is provided from a hydraulic generator compartment 44 on the carriage for these and other hydraulic motors of the installation to impart a balanced driving force to the carriage, drawing the carriage along the chains so that it can be progressed along the length of the hold. The pivoted boon 6 is supported at its end adjacent the bucket wheel by cables 50, 52 on opposite sides of the carriage, a common zilch drum 54 on one side of the carriage sving both cables reeled onto it. The supporting cable 50 on the winch siFe runs around a rear pulley 56 on the carriage, then returns from there, over an upper guide pulley 58, to be taicen around multiple sheaves comprising an upper pair 60 mounted on the free ends of the carriage side members 2a and a lower pai 62 mounted at the bottom of the adjacent end of the boom, the end of the cable being fastened off on the carriage side members.The other supporting cable 52 is led from the winch drum to the other side of the carriage by way of side pulleys 64,66 mounted on the cross member 2b of the carriage below the boom, over an upper guide pulley 68, placed on te opposite arm 2a from that carrying the first guide pulley 58, a nd round further multiple sheaves 60,62 for the cable 50. An automatically braked hydraulic motor 70 driving the winch drum reels in and pays out both cables 50, 52 together, so that a balanced lifting force is applied for luffing the boom and supporting it at arequired position. The boon conveyor 16 comprises a studded or cleated belt 72 extending between a motor driven drun 74 adjacent the boon pivots and a return drum 76 that is disposed inside tie inner rim of the bucket wheel, above its stub shaft mounting. Troughing idler rollers 78 support the upper run of the belt between these end drums. he bucket wheel is rotated on its Journal support 14, e.g. by a pair of hydraulic motors 80 supported on the boom and having respective drive pinions not shown engaging a common gear flng 82 on the wheel. The buckets 84 o the bucket wheel are of the cell less type, that is to say they are open on their radially inner face, their materialcollecting space being defined b front and rear walls and curved outer wall acting as a scoop.In order to retain th material in each bucket as it begins to rise out of the hold, an arcuate cover plate 86 is fixed to the boom head to overlie the inner rim of the bucket wheel over a part of its peripheral extent. The cover plate terminates near the top of inner rim where it is fixed to a chute 88 opening onto the belt 72 of the conveyor 16, so that material that has been held in the buckets is then able to fall freely through the chute onto the conveyor belt and be carried away along the boom. The chute is provided with flexible screen walls 90 that extend some distance along the conveyor belt to limit spillage of material as it falls onto the belt. A further chute 94 at the rear end of the boon, mounted on the carriage cross menber 2b, transfers material from the boom conveyor 15 onto the cross conveyor 18, driven also by a motorised drum 96, that raises the material to a discharge chute 98, also mounted on the carriage, through which the material falls onto the fixed ship side conveyor 20.Since this conveyor 20 runs the length of the hold, the material will discharge continuously onto it as the carriage progresses along the hold. Walkways 100 are provided on the carriage for ready access to such parts of the installation as the boom conveyor an the vorious drive units, and also to an operator s 102, on the carriage adjacent the head of the boom, from which unloading is controlled so that the operation of the bucket wheel can be clearly seen at all staves. The boom and bucket wheel are shown in a position in which the may be stowed during the passage of the ship.The unloader in this example is disposed forwards of the bridge and to improve the line of sight from ne bridge Tilile the unloader is not in use the chosen position is below the fully raised position, in which the bucket wheel may be held completely above deck level in order to allow the carriage to be driven past the limits of the hold if required. During unloading, the carriage is progressed along the length of the hold while the bucket wheel is supported, through the luffing drive of the boom winch drum 54, at a height that gives the required depth of penetration into the material in the hold usually less than the radial depth of the buckets. In this way it is possible to reduce the possibility of the bucket wheel becoming jammed in the material, although it is still desirable to provide the gear teeth of the bucket wheel gear ring 82 with large root clearances to prevent the tooth spaces becoming packed with foreign matter as the teeth mesh with the teeth of the drive pinions of the bucket wheel drive motors. Because of its orientation, the bucket wheel is able to pick up material in both directions of travel of the carriage, so t t unloading can be performed substantially continuously.At the or 0 each pass, it is necessary simply to lower the boom urtner amount to pick up more material, and the process can be wholly or partly continued under automatic control if desired as regards the luffing of the boom and or the travel of the carriage. Because the diameter of the bucket wheel is nearly equal to the width of the hold there is no need to traverse tne wheel laterally and there is no danger of leaving material at the sides to collapse upon the bucket wheel or otherwise jam the unloader. The hold bottom is preferably convex shaped in transverse profile, as illustrated, to suit the circular profile of the bucket whe which can be done relatively simply and economically without requiring an unusual hull profile or wasting any significant amount of space within the hull. It is of course not necessary to match the profiles exactly, as any loose material at the sides o the hold will tend to fall into the path of the bucket wheel as material is removed from the hold, and it will in any case not be important to ensure that the small final part of a cargo is removed completely.Safety chains not shown may be attached to the boom to ensure that the bucket wheel is ket out of contact with the bottom of the hold, Fig. 4 illustrates a modification of the apparatus in Figs. 1 to 3, intended to cope with the removal of materialProm a storage space that is of 53 oh a denth that the bucket eel would be tilted to too reat an inclination to operate effectively if it were mounted on a fixed axis relative to the luffing boom. In this modified construction. luffing boom 110 has upper links 112 above an parallel to it, the boom and the lilfrs navin respective upper and lo ser rear pivots 114,116 with the longitudinally displaceable carriage 118 and upper and lower forward pivots 120,122 with bucket wheel head 124 on which the bucket wheel 126 is mounted to rotate upon a stub shaft 130 projecting longitudinally from the head.The distance between the upper pivots 114,120 is equal to that between the lower pivots 116,122 and the arms 112 thereby act with the boom as a parallelogram linkage supporting the bucket wheel so that its stub shaft axis is held in the sane orientation, independently of the extent to which the boom has been lowered. The head 124 carries the drive notor or motors not shown of the bucket wheel and also a chute 132 through which the buckets discharge their collected material onto boom conveyor belt 134 as ty reach the top of the wheels The bottom of the chute is inclined away from the conveyor belt in the boom position illustrated this leaves sufficient clearance for the required downward luffing of the boom. The gap between the chute and the conveyor belt is always at least tartly covered by side screens 136 of flexible material that are secured directly to the boom structure so as to be able to overlap the sides of the chute 132.At te rear of the boom, the material is discharged from the conveyor 134 into a chute 140 fixed to the carriage above a cross conveyor 142, tWe apparatus of its I to 5. In all other respects the co construction and operation of the apparatus can be as already described with reference to that first embodiment of the invention. It will be clear from the description of Figs. 1 to 3 that t e choice of a bucket wheel diameter close to the width of the material storage space simplifies the construction and operation of the unloader, but there may be instances in which the wheel would then be excessively large if the storage space is very wide. It is therefore possible within the scope of the invention to provide a traversing mechanism so that the bucket wheel can be limited to a diameter considerably may be arranged to slew or it less than the width of the space.Thus, the luffing boom can be mounted at its pivoted end on a cross carriage that is transversely displaceable on the main longitudinally movable carriage, and the boom conveyor can be arranged to discharge onto a cross conveyor that runs the extent of the cross carriage travel. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where parts described in the pr vious figures have been indicated by the same reference numerals and the cross carriage and cross conveyor are indicated by the numerals 144, 146 respectively. The depth of penetration of the wheel into the stored material can still be controlled as already described, although in the illustrated example the free end of the boom adjustably suspended from a support arm 148 directly above the boom, and the rXeed to traverse the wheel laterally will not prevent it operating in both directions of longitudinal travel, Pig. 5 also shows in outline the alternative slewing arrangement referred to above, in which a slewing mounting 150 at the centre of the carriage cross member permits the boom to be slewed to move the bucket wheel 12 to either side of the hold along the path 152. It will be understood that the unloader described above can be modified in many other ways within the scope of the invention. The forms of drive for the moving parts can be chosen to meet particular requirements and any suitable motive power source can be employed. Similarly other types of conveyor belt can be used. Also, although the bucket wheel described isof the cell less type, in some instances it may be preferable to use a cell type or a semi cell type of bucket wheel to suit the material being handled.
