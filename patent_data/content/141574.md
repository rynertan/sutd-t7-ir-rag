# A SCOOP FOR PICKING UP LUBRICANT

## Abstract
A scoop for picking up lubricant from the inner cylin drical surface of a peripheral ring of a disc or a shaft into a sump of lubricant, e.g. on a bearing of the type of European Patent Application No. 0073281A in which a deflector 32 is rockable between two positions. In the position illustrated in Figure 1, the tip 37 of one arm of the defector is adjacent the cylindrical surface 27 while the iner surface 38 of the other arm seals against the surface 28 on the body 14 , a passage 44 being provided for the flow of lubricant. In the other position, for the opposite direction of rotation, the tip 35 is adjacent the surface 27 and the surfaces 30 and 40 provide a seal.
