# Method of removal of slag deposits from the bottom of a furnace.

## Abstract
Slag deposited on the bottom of a steel making furnace, especially a soaking pit for steel ingots, is difficult to remove. To enable this to be done while the furnace is hot, it is now proposed to supply a substance, e.g. ferro silicon, which lowers the melting point of the slag, and a substance which reacts exothermically to initiate melting of the slag. When the slag is sufficiently liquefied, it is removed by means of a mechanical grab.
