# ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS BASED ON PHENOLIC RESINS AND PRODUCTS FORMED FROM THEM

## Abstract
An adhesive composition comprises a phenol aldehyde resin or other phenolic resin, an epoxy resin and an acrylic elastomer, generally an ethylene acrylic elastomer. The adhesive may be used in flexible circuitry, laminates and elec trical products. The adhesive has improved flexibility and adhesive properties. It may be applied in solution form or may be cast as a free standing film which is later heated and com pressed to give adhesive properties.
