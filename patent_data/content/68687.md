## Abstract
A heat recoverable electrical connector has a tubular enclosure that is open at each end to receive respec tive elongate electrical conductors. The openings are such that the conductors are receivable in the connec tor by bringing them thereto in a translational movement from a direction perpendicular to their axes the need for accurate alignment of the conductors with the con nector is thus avoided. The connector is subsequently heated to effect its recovery and to connect and en capsulate the conductors. Electrical connection between the conductors is enhanced by a solder ring located within the connector enclosure.
