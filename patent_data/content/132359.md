## Description
NATURAL HUMAN INTERLEUKIN 2 AND PRODUCTION THEREOF This invention relates to natural human interleukin 2 and a method of producing the same. In the present specification, claims and drawings, interleukin 2 is sometimes abbreviated as IL 2. Interleukin 2 formerly called T cell growth factor TCGF is a lymphokine produced by T cells upon stimulation, e.g. with a lectin or alloantigen Science, 193, 1007 1976 Immunological Reviews, 51, 257 1980 .IL 2 enables long term in vitro passage of T cells with their functions retained. In addition, IL 2 reportedly promotes thymocyte mitogen reaction costimulator , restores the antibody production against T cell dependent antigens by nude mouse spleen cells T cell replacing factor and promotes the differentiation and growth of killer cells killer helper factor . The Journal of Immunology, 123, 2928 1979 Immunological Reviews, 51, 257 1980 . By the use of IL 2, a number of killer T cells, helperT cells, and natural killer cells, among others, have been cloned so far e.g. Nature, 268, 154 1977 The Journal ofImmunology, 130, 981 1983 . IL 2 can be used in selective in vitro amplification of antigen specific killer T cells which can recognize specific antigens, for example,tumor antigens, and destruct tumor cells carrying those specific antigens. It is possible to suppress or inhibit tumor growth by adoptively transferring such tumor specific killerT cells into tumor bearing animals The Journal of Immuno logy, 125, 1904 1980 . Furthermore, it is known thatIL 2 induces the production of interferon y The Journal ofImmunology, 130, 1784 1983 and activates natural killer cells The Journal of Immunology, 130, 1970 1983 . These experimentally found facts suggest the potential of IL 2 as an antitumor agent. It is further known thatIL 2 restores the helper T cell function in nude mice which are deficient in thymus functions European Journal ofImmunology, vol. 10, page 719 1980 and restores the induction of killer T cells against allogenic cells Nature, vol. 284, page 278 1980 , and therefore the use of IL 2 in the treatment of immunodeficiency diseases can also be expected to be fruitful. The present inventors found that cultivation, in the presence of an inducer, of cells capable of producing humanIL 2 led to formation and accumulation, in the culture fluid, of at least two IL 2 species differing in properties and succeeded in isolating the two human IL 2 species, namely human IL 2 A and B. The two human IL 2 species are characterized by the physicochemical properties and biological activities to be described later in detail. They are human IL 2 species discovered for the first time by the present inventors. As a result of continued intensive study, the present inventors established a method of producing human IL 2 efficiently by cultivating human IL 2 producing cells in the presence of an inducer and isolating the two human IL 2 species A and B from the culture fluid, and a method of producing human IL 2A 1, A 2, B 1, B 2 and a mixture thereof by subjecting said human IL 2A and B to further purification procedure Thus, the present invention provides 1 human interleukin 2 A, B, a mixture thereof, A l, A 2, B 1, B 2 or a mixture thereof, 2 a method of producing human interleukin 2 A, B,a mixture thereof, A l, A 2, B l, B 2 or a mixture thereof, which comprises cultivating, in the presence of an inducer, cells capable of producing human IL 2, thereby causing formation and accumulation of at least one of the humanIL 2 and recovering the same. The cells to be used for the production of human IL 2 may be any cells capable of producing human IL 2. From the viewpoint of availability, however, human lymphocytic or leukocytic cells are preferred. In particular, the use of human peripheral blood derived lymphocytes is advantageous. It is also possible to use an adequate established cell line. Human peripheral blood derived lymphocytes can be separated from the buffy coat from normal humans by the specific gravity centrifugation method such as the dextran method or the Ficoll Hypaque method Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigations, vol. 21,Supplement 97, page 77 1968 . As an established leukocyte cell line, there may be used, for instance, a human T leukemia cell line such asJURKAT FHCRC. The JURKAT FHCRC cell line is readily available from the Salk Institute Cell Bank California,USA or other institutions. The medium to be used in growing human IL 2 producing cells may be of any type provided that said cells can produce human IL 2 in the medium. Nevertheless, media suited for animal cell culture, for instance commercially available RPMI 1640 medium Journal of Americal Medical Association, vol. 199, page 519 1967 , can be advantageously used. It is preferable to add 0.05 to 1 mg ml of an antibiotic, such as kanamycin, penicillin or streptomycin.Although it is usual to add 0.1 to 50w w , preferably 2 to 20w w animal serum, such as fetal bovine serum or bovine serum, it is by far preferable to cultivate the cells in the medium without addition of any animal serum because it makes purification work easier. As the IL 2 inducer, there may be mentioned, among others, lectins concanavalin A Con A , phytohemagglutininA PHA , various antigens including alloantigens, and phorbol esters 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA . The mixture of these inducers may be added to the medium. The above mentioned antigen includes, among others, alloantigens e.g. allogeneic or xenogeneic B lymphocytic cells with cell division suppressed by treatment with mitomycin C generally in a concentration of 10 to 200 pg ml for 30 minutes to 5 hours or X ray irradiation in the case of human cells, for instance, Namalva cells Intervirology, 5, 205 1975 , BALL 1 cells Nature, 267, 843 1977 , and RPMI 8226 cells Immunology, 38, 63 1979 can be effectively used. Lectins, phorbol esters and alloantigens are examples of inducers for combined use. More concretely, it is preferable to use, for instance, Con A as lectin, TPA as phorbol ester and Namalva cells as alloantigen in concentrations of, for example, 5 to 80.ug ml, 1 to 1,500 ng ml and lox104 to 5x106 cells ml, respectively. The cultivation is performed in the manner of static culture, spinner culture, roller bottle culture and so on.Spinner culture is preferable for IL 2 production by largescale cultivation in serum containing medium, whereas static culture, especially in a multistage tray, is suited for efficient production of IL 2 in a serum free medium. Inoculation is conducted generally in a cell concentration of 0.1 to 50 x 106 cells ml, preferably 1 to 5 x 106 cells ml, and incubation is conducted at 30 to 400C in the presence of 1 to 20 CO2. pH of the culture medium during the cultivation is, generally maintained between 6 and 8, preferably between 7 and 7.4. The incubation period is selected on the basis of induction and production of IL 2. Generally, it is preferable to separate and collect the culture supernatant after 10 to 120 hours, more preferably 48 to 96 hours, of incubation. An IL 2 dependent cell line may be used for assaying human IL 2 accumulated in the medium according to the present invention. Since IL 2 is known to promote the growth of IL 2 dependent cells not only of humans but also of rats and mice, among others Immunological Reviews, 51, 257 1980 , not only IL 2 dependent human cell lines but also IL 2 dependent rat or mouse cell lines can also be used Journal of Immunology, 130, 981 and 988 1983 . Separation of the IL 2 species from the culture supernatant and purification thereof according to the present invention can be carried out by adequate combined use of known purification methods, which include, among others, methods making use of solubility differences1 such as salting out and precipitation from a solution, methods making use of differences in molecular weight, such as ultrafiltration, gel filtration and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, methods making use pf differences in electric charge such as ion exchange chromatography, methods making use of specific affinity, such as affinity chromatography, methods making use of differences in hydrophobicity such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and methods making use of differences in isoelectric point, such as isoelectric focusing. Thus, for instance, an IL 2 containing culture supernatant is collected by centrifugation and made acidic pH 3.5 with a mineral acid such as concentrated hydrochloric acid, the resulting precipitate is removed by using filter paper, for instance, the filtrate is passed over a cation exchange chromatographic carrier such as sulfopropyl cross . linked dextran, e.g. SP Sephadex commat Pharmacia, Sweden column, and elution is carried out with a salt e.g. NaCl containing buffer. The active fraction thus collected is dialyzed ad then passed through an anion exchange chromatographic carrier, such as a DEAE Sephacel Pharmacia, Sweden column, followed by elution with a salt e.g. NaCQ containing buffer. Then the active eluate is concentrated by using an ultrafiltration apparatus and the active eluate is subjected to gel filtration using polyacrylamide agarose, e.g.Ultrogel LKB, Sweden column or the like. The active fraction collected is dialyzed and again treated with an anion exchanger such as DEAE cellulose, elution being carried out with a salt solution for example elution making use of a linear NaCl concentration gradient .In this way, a mixture of human IL 2A and B is obtained.The ratio of IL 2A to IL 2B ranges between 1 1 and 1 3 by weight . The active fraction is again subjected to gel filtration using polyacrylamide agarose e.g. Ultrogeli column. In the above separation and purification process, the elution of IL 2 with a salt solution e.g. a buffer containing 0 to 0.2 M NaCl following adsorption on an anion exchanger such as DEAE cellulose, when conducted with a gradual salt concentration gradient, gives two activity peaks of IL 2. The first activity peak fraction collected during elution at the lower salt concentration range is called a human IL 2A containing fraction, while the second activity peak fraction collected during elution at the higher salt concentration range is called a human IL 2B containing fraction. In this way, there can be obtained crude humanIL 2A or B. When subjected to high performance liquid chromatography, thus obtained crude IL 2A fraction can be resolved into two peaks of activity, IL 2A 1 and IL 2A 2, each homogeneous on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two peaks of activity can be collected together to give IL 2A or collected separately to give IL 2A 1 and IL 2A 2, repectively. Human IL 2A is thus a mixture of IL 2A 1 andIL 2A 2. The ratio of IL 2A 1 to IL 2A 2 ranges between 1 1 and 1 2 by weight . Similarly, high performance liquid chromatography can resolve the crude IL 2B fraction into two peaks of activity,IL 2B 1 and IL 2B 2, each homogeneous on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two peaks of activity can be collected together to give IL 2B or collected separately to give IL2B 1 and IL 2B 2, respectively. IL 2B is thus a mixture of IL 2B 1 and IL 2B 2. The ratio of IL 2B 1 to IL 2B 2 ranges between 1 1 and 1 2 by weight . The above procedures are carried out at a temperature ranging from 0 to 300C, preferably 2 to 60C. As the high performance liquid chromatography, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography is advantageously employed. The temperature is 20 to 40 C, preferably 25 to 35 C. By DEAE SephacelR column chromatography in the purification procedure described above, IL 2 is eluted as a single peak of activity containing IL 2A and IL 2B. When the thus obtained fraction containing both IL 2A and IL 2B is subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, IL 2 can be resolved into two peaks of activity, one containing IL 2A 1 and IL 2B 1, and the otherIL 2A 2 and IL 2B 2. Therefore, two peaks of activity can be collected together to give a mixture of IL 2A and IL 2B or collected separately to give a mixture of IL 2A 1 andIL 2B 1, and a mixture of IL 2A 2 and IL 2B 2, respectively.The ratio of IL 2A l to IL 2B 1 ranges between 1 1 and 1 3 by weight , and the ratio of I1 2A 2 toIL 2B 2 ranges between 1 1 and 1 3 by weight . Thus obtained human IL 2 sample can be assayed for purity by various electrophoretic methods, among others. Particularly preferred is SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in which the purity of protein can be determined with good sensitivity by the Coomassie brilliant blue Sigma Chemical Company, USA or silver staining method, for instance. In SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it is also possible to calculate the molecular weight of the active entity. The human IL 2 of the present invention is separated and recovered in accordance with the present inventionfrana culture of cells capable of producing human IL 2. In addition, it is also obtained in large amounts by utilizing the gene manipulation technique. Furthermore, monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to said human IL 2 can be produced by immunizing mice, rabbits or other animals with the humanIL 2 of the present invention as an immunogen, and the antibodies obtained in this manner can be used in preparing affinity columns for the isolation and recovery of the human IL 2 of the present invention. The human IL 2 obtainable in accordance with the present invention is low in toxicity, has little antigenecity because of its origin in humans, exhibits activity of maintaining the functions of normal T cells and natural killer cells, and therefore, can be used in in vitro long term culture, subculture or cloning of T cells and natural killer cells. Furthermore, the IL 2 of the present invention can selectively promote in vitro proliferation of, for instance, antigen specific killer T cells, which recognize and destruct cells with tumor antigens, or natural killer cells, which are capable of killing tumors without prior sensitization with the tumor antigens. Furthermore, when the humanIL 2 of the present invention is used for inoculation of a living organism simultaneously with the transplantation of said killer T cells, the antitumor effect of the killer cells is increased. Therefore, the present human IL 2 is useful as growth promoting agents for killer T cells and natural killer cells, as antitumor agents, or as immunodeficiency disease treating agents.The present human IL 2 is useful for the prevention or treatment of tumor or treatment of immunodeficiency diseases in warm blooded animals e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, pig, horse, sheep, cattle, human . For this purpose, the human IL 2 of the present invention can be mixed or diluted with a per se known and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient to make up a composition in the form of, for instance, injections or capsules. Such a composition can be administered either parenterally or orally. The human IL 2 can be used either alone or in combination with killer T cells or natural killer cells grown in vitro in the manner mentioned above. Very small doses of the human IL 2 according to the present invention are sufficient for the above purposes, since the dissociation constant between the IL 2 and theIL 2 receptor of cells is very small. For promoting the in vitro growth of T cells, the human IL 2 according to the present invention can be added to the medium in a concentration of 0.01 to 1 U ml, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 U ml. Usually IL 2 about 0.1 to 0.5 U ml is added to a cell suspension containing alloantigen sensitized T cells which have been obtained by 3 day lymphocyte ixed culture of humanperipheral blood T cells lox106 cells ml in the presence of X ray irradiated 1500 rads B cell transformants lox106 cells ml in RPXI 1640 medium containing 20t fetal bovine serum at 370C under an atmosphere of 5 CO2. The incubation is continued for about one month with exchange of medium at approximately weekly intervals. In the present application, amino acids, when convenient, are abbreviated according to the lUPAC lUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or the practice in the field of the art. In case optical isomerism is involved, the amino acids are in the Lrform unless otherwise specifically indicated.
