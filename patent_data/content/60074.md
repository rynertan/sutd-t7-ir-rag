# WEIGHSTATIONS AND REMOTE CONTROL THEREOF

## Abstract
A weighstation which includes a weighbeam and is arranged to provide indications of axle loadings of a vehicle as the vehicle passes over it has a transmitting and receiving unit which is adapted for cooperation with a remote controller situated in the cab of a vehicle. The remote controller is arranged to initiate the operation of the weighstation and for this purpose transmits by way of an infra red link a command signal and a further set of signals denoting the number of axles possessed by the vehicle. The unit in the weighstation provides as the vehicle passes over the weighbeam signals denoting the axle loadings of the vehicle and transmits these signals to the remote controller together with further signals which are used by the remote controller to provide a visible indication in the cab of the vehicle of the axle loadings of the vehicle and such further information as may be desired, such as time of day.
