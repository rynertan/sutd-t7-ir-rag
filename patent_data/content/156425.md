# Process for the preparation of improved hydroconversion catalysts and catalysts thus prepared.

## Abstract
A process for preparing hydroconversion catalysts hav ing improved hydrodenitrification HDN activity, containing Group VIII and or Group VIB catalytically active metals on a support, and particularly those containing nickel and molyb denum, by incorporating zero valent molybdenum and or tungsten carbonyls into the catalyst support wherein a liquid mixture containing metal carbonyl s and a catalytically ac tive amount of dienes, trienes or monoaromatics to which free sulphur has been added is mixed with a dried catalyst support and heating the liquid solid mixture until metal car bonyl conversion to metal disulphide is substantially com plete. The catalyst is then dried followed by calcining in inert gas, before use in a hydroconversion process.
