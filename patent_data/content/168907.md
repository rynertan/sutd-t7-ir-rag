# Monoclonal antibodies recognizing L thyroxine.

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies specific for thyroxine T₄ are pro duced by two new and separate hybridoma cell lines. Combina tions of the monoclonal antibodies from the two cell lines are used in an immunoassay for T₄ of high accuracy over the range of T₄ concentrations encountered in serum samples.
