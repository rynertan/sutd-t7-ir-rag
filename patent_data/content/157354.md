# Method for designating a recognition mode in a hand written character graphic recognizer.

## Abstract
A hand written character graphic is recognized in a character recognition mode or a graphic recognition mode designated in accordance with stroke information supplied from a tablet input device 1 which samples the hand writ ten character graphic and converts it to the stroke in formation. The recognition mode is automatically designated by comparing a longer one of projection lengths on x axis and y axis of stroke coordinates with a predetermined threshold for a hand written character input.
