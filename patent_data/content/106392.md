# Process for the production of aromatics, benzene, toluene, xylene BTX from heavy hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Process for the production of enhanced benzene, toiuene, xylene BTX yields from heavy hydrocarbon. A heavy hydrocarbon, such as kerosene or heavier hydrocar bon, is partially cracked in a conventional pyrolysis furnace. At the same time ethane is cracked at a high conversion in the same pyrolysis furnace. Upon partial cracking of the heavy hydrocarbon, the cracked effluent from the ethane is delivered to the heavy hydrocarbon stream. This ethane serves as a diluent to effect complete cracking of the heavy hydrocarbon. The heavy hydrocarbon is further cracked by the heat available from the ethane or additional radiant firing or by the combination thereof.
