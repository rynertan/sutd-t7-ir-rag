## Description
The invention relates to a process for preparing a Guerbet alcohol, that is, a branched dimerized alcohol, which comprises the step of heating and condensing a primary alcohol in the presence of an alkaline substance and a catalyst comprising a carrier and copper nickel as catalytic components. It is well known that when a primary alcohol is condensed by heating in the presence of an alkali alone or together with a co catalyst, one molecule of water is removed from two molecules of the starting alcohol to obtain one molecule of a branched dimerized alcohol, and this reaction is called Guerbet reaction . Various reports have been published in connection with the mechanism of the Guerbet rection, and it has been considered that this reaction is advanced according to the following mechanism It is considered that the branched dimerized alcohol is formed by the concurrent reactions represented by the above formulae 1 through 4 . Rates of the reactions represented by the formulae 1 through 4 vary according to the reaction temperature, the amount of the alkali and the amount and kind of the co catalyst, and hence, the selectivity should naturally vary depending on these factors. The reaction respresented by the formula 5 is a reaction of consuming the starting alcohol, and as the reaction temperature is elevated, the rate of this reaction is ordinarily increased, that is, the yield of the branched dimerized alcohol is reduced. Accordingly, examinations have been made on co catalysts for inhibiting the advance of the reaction of the formula 5 while promoting those of the formulae 1 through 4 . For example, copper chromite, copper zinc oxide, copper powder, zinc oxide, zinc chromite, stabilized nickel, nickel supported on alumina silicate or active carbon, platinum supported on alumina silicate or active carbon, palladium supported on alumina silicate or active carbon, ruthenium supported on alumina silicate or active carbon, rhodium supported on alumina silicate or active carbon, and Raney catalysts nickel, chromium, copper and the like and developed catalysts thereof have been used as the co catalyst. However, these co catalysts are still insufficient in the point of increasing the rates of the reactions of the formulae 3 and 4 and eventually obtaining a Guerbet alcohol having a high quality. When the foregoning co catalysts are employed, the reactions of the formulae 1 and 2 are promoted and the conversion is increased, but formation of aldehydes, unsaturated compounds and carboxylic acids as by products is increased, resulting in reduction of the yield and selectivity. US A 2 875 241 concerns a method of preparing a polyhydroxy alcohol by heating a glycol containing at least 3 and not more than 10 carbon atoms, and at least one of the hydroxyl groups is a primary hydroxyl group. The glycol is heated in the presence of an inorganic basic substance and 1 to 5 parts by weight of copper chromite nickel catalyst. The polyhydroxy alcohols in the reaction mixture are esterified with a lower alkanoyl group, the esters of the desired polyhydroxy alcohols are distilled and then hydrolysed to produce the desired polyhydroxy alcohols. However, in order to avoid decomposition, cyclization and excessive polymerization the condensation reaction must be carried out under mild conditions, and special procedures are used to separate the polyhydric alkanol products from the reaction mixture as there is excessive degradation of the product when separation by ordinary distillation is attempted. The yield of the desired triols or tetraols is low since most of the diol used as starting material is recovered. The aldehyde and unsaturated compounds formed as by products have a bad smell and cause discoloration and oxidation, and these by products impede applications of the branched dimerized alcohol. A process for preparing a Guerbet alcohol which comprises the step of heating and condensing a primary alcohol in the presence of an alkaline substance and a catalyst is known from the publication Industrial and Engineering Chemistry , Vol. 53, No. 1, January 1961, pages 33 to 36. The catalysts are used in amounts which are usual in the state of the art. The inventors have made researches with a view to preparing a Guerbet alcohol having a high quality with a reduced content of aldehyde and unsaturated compounds as by products and preventing reduction of the yield by controlling formation of carboxylic acid salts as by products, and as the result, found that this object can be attained by a process for preparing a Guerbet alcohol which comprises the step of heating and condensing a primary alcohol in the presence of an alkaline substance and a catalyst comprising a carrier and copper nickel as catalytic components, characterized in that an alcohol of the general formula The inventors now completed the present invention based on this finding. Surprisingly, when the copper nickel catalyst is used in the process for the invention, the reactivity per unit metal weight is several times as high as those of the known copper chromate and Raney nickel catalysts and this catalyst exerts a catalytic action on the reactions of the formulae 3 and 4 and a branched dimerized alcohol having a reduced content of the aldehyde and unsaturated compounds can be obtained. Furthermore, since the reaction rate is increased, the reaction may be carried out at lower tempratures, and if the raction temperature is controlled to a low level, formation of a carboxylic acid salt as a by product is reduced and the alkali of the catalyst effectively acts mainly on the main reaction. Moreover, the post treatment for removing the carboxylic acid salt can be performed very easily. The copper nickel catalyst which has been used in the process of the present invention may be recovered and then used for the reaction again. The copper nickel catalyst used in the process of the present invention comprises copper and nickel components as indispensable components, and these components may be used in the form of metals or metal oxides or in the state thereof supported on a suitable carrier. Materials customarily used as catalyst carriers, such as alumina, silica alumina, diatomaceous earth, silica, active carbon, natural zeolite and artificial zeolite may be used as the carrier in the process of the present invention. The amount of the catalytic metals supported on the carrier is not particularly critical, but it is ordinarily preferred that the amount of the catalytic metals supported on the carrier be 10 to 60 percent by weight. The catalyst may be prepared according to various methods. For example in the case where the catalytic metal components are supported on a carrier, there may be adopted a method in which a carrier is incorporated into a solution of appropriate salts of copper and nickel to be sufficiently impregnated with the solution, then dried and calcined the impregnation method , and a method in which a carrier is incorporated in an aqueous solution of appropriate salts of copper and nickel, for example, an aqueous solution of copper nitrate and nickel nitrate, the solution is sufficiently stirred and an aqueous solution of an alkali such as sodium carbonate, aqueous ammonia or sodium hydroxide is added to the above solution to precipitate metal salts on the carrier the coprecipitation method . In the case where zeolite or the like is used as the carrier, there may be adopted a method in which sodium or the like on zeolite is ion exchanged with copper and nickel the ion exchange method . Furthermore, there may be adopted a method in which copper, nickel and aluminium metals are molten by heating, the melt is then cooled and solidified to form an alloy and aluminium in the alloy is eluted out by caustic soda the alloy method . Namely, the catalyst may be prepared according to any of these known methods. In case of the impregnation and coprecipitation methods, the metal deposited carrier is sufficiently washed with water, dried at about 100 and calcinated at 300 to 400 C to obtain a catalyst. The copper nickel catalyst used in the process of the present invention is especially effective when the copper nickel weight ratio is in the range of from 85 15 to 50 50. The copper nickel catalyst to be used in the process of the invention leads to a reaction rate which is increased to a level several times as high as that attained by a catalyst composed solely of copper or nickel. Moreover, the copper nickel catalyst used in the process of the present invention is excellent in the rate of the Guerbet reaction over the conventionally known co catalysts. Moreover, the copper nickel catalyst used in the process of the present invention is characteristic over the known co catalysts in that the copper nickel catalyst is excellent in both the reaction rate and the selectivity. In short, the copper nickel catalyst used in the process of the present invention provides a Guerbet alcohol having a reduced content of by products such as aldehyde or unsaturated compounds. When the copper nickel catalyst is used in the process of the present invention, the above mentioned effects can be attained under the same conditions as adopted for the conventional co catalysts, and in the view of the specific characteristics, it is preferred that the reaction temperature be lowered. Namely, a reaction temperature lower than 250 C, especially lower than 230 C, is preferably selected. When the copper nickel catalyst is used in the process of the present invention, a reaction temperature of 200 to 220 C is sufficient if the reaction is conducted for 2 to 3 hours. At this reaction temperature formation of a carboxylic acid salt as a by product is controlled and hence, the alkali of the catalyst acts effectively on the main reaction. Any of primary alcohols represented by the above general formula I can be used as the starting alcohol in the present invention. It is practicable in the invention that the process is conducted at 200 to 250 C for 1 to 5 hours. Among the starting alcohol, a normal alkyl alcohol is suitably used. The cycloalkyl group as R of the formula has preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms, espcially cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The aryl group pereferably includes phenyl. The aralkyl group preferably includes benzyl. The reaction in the process of the present invention is a dehydration reaction, and ordinarily, the reaction is advanced while water formed by the reaction is removed from the reaction system. For this purpose, there is usually adopted a method in which the dehydration reaction is carried out under reflux of the starting alcohol at a temperature higher than the boiling point of the starting alcohol. When the reaction temperature is lower than or different from the boiling point of the starting alcohol, the reaction is carried out under a reduced pressure or an elevated pressure. Furthermore, there may be adopted a method in which water formed by the reaction is expelled by blowing an inert gas such as nitrogen gas into the reaction system. As the alkaline substance to be used in the present invention, there can be mentioned, for example, metallic sodium, sodium alcoholate, caustic soda, sodium carbonate, sodium amide, metallic potassium, potassium amide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate and potassium phosphate. Among these alkaline substances, potassium hydroxide is especially preferred. In the present invention, the alkaline substance may be used in an amount customarily adopted in the Guerbet reaction, but when the reaction temperature is relatively lowered by using the copper nickel catalyst of the present invention, the proportion of the alkali to be consumed by conversion to an alkali salt of a carboxylic acid is reduced, and therefore, a sufficient catalytic action can be attained if the alkali is used in an amount corresponding to about 1 2 of the amount used in the conventional method. In short, in the present invention, the alkaline substance is used in an amount of 0.25 to 5 by weight, preferably 0.5 to 2.0 by weight, based on the starting alcohol. An amount of the copper nickel catalyst to be used as a co catalyst in the process of the invention is 0.002 to 1.0 percent by weight, preferably 0.005 to 0.2 by weight, based on the starting alcohol.
