# APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING PACKED FOOD.

## Abstract
Apparatus for manufacturing a food product, e.g. kn√∂del, picnic eggs, knishes, etc. packed with an outer covering over the inner packing. This apparatus has inner and outer cylindrical assemblies with substantially horizontal axes, with the annular passage way for the outer covering disposed between the facing surfaces of the assemblies. The assemblies have inner and outer cylinders contacting each other and are arranged so that they can periodically rotate around the common axis. The inner and outer cylinders of the outer assembly have outlet and inlet openings respec tively of the outer covering material. The inner and outer cylinders of the inner assembly each have outlet openings of inner packing material at their bodies. The openings of each of the assemblies periodically occupy the opening position and closing position as the cylinder rotates. The inlet of the inner packing material is provided at the side of the inner assembly.
