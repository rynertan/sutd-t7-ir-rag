# Winder having winding shaft extraction device.

## Abstract
A winder wherein, following completion of the winding operation, a roll receiver 1 is moved from a standby posi tion to a position under the completed sheet roll or rolls R and the winding shaft 2 used to wind the roll or rolls is then extracted to free the rolls for removal from the winder. Additionally, the winder is provided with a supply tension control for changing the tension in the web from that in the operation of unwinding the sheet from the web roll to a tension better suited for the winding operation, a winding torque adjuster which adjusts the winding torque by increasing the friction between the winding shaft and the winding core by regulating the air pressure within the hol low center of the winding shaft, and a winding core locking mechanism whereby the winding core is locked in place by spheres provided on the outer surface of a large number of core supporting collars fitted on the winding shaft.
