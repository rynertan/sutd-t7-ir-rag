# COMPARATOR CIRCUIT AND METHOD

## Abstract
A magnitude comparator circuit is provided for de termining the largest binary number, out of a plurality of binary numbers received bit serially, in parallel. A latch is used to store the results of the comparison and is initialized to an all logic 0 state. The latch has a unique one bit location corresponding to each number being compared, and a logic 0 stored in the latch in dicates that the number corresponding thereto is still in contention i.e remains a candidate for being the lar gest, and a logic 1 indicates it has been eliminated from contention. As the numbers are received bit by bit most significant bits first the bits are applied to gating circuits, one for each number, which invert the bits and store the inverted result in the latch. The exceptions to this are twofold a when a number has already been eliminated from contention, as indicated by a logic 1 stored in the latch corresponding to that number, it remains a logic 1 and b when the remaining candidates all have a binary 0 in an equal significant bit location no choice is of course possible and the aforestated in version does not take place and the contents of the latch are simply recycled.
