# Ribbon speaker system.

## Abstract
A ribbon speaker system comprising a three element tweeter, midrange and woofer acoustical transducer unit is disclosed. The tweeter transducer consists of a single, elongated, corrugated aluminum ribbon positioned vertically and connected to the top and bottom of a rigid, elongated frame. Electrical connections are provided at the top and bottom to permit current flow along the length of the ribbon. The aluminum ribbon is located between sets of magnets which are designed to provide a shaped magnetic field that provides magnetic centering of the ribbon. Additional elec tromagnetic containment for the transducer ribbon is pro vided by electrical current passing through the ribbon which current returns to its source by means of flat ribbon conductors located on the surfaces of the magnet sets. The midrange transducer consists of a single elongated corrugated aluminum ribbon positioned vertically and con nected to an elongated frame similar to the tweeter transduc er. However, unlike the tweeter transducer, the edges of the midrange ribbon are acoustically sealed to the frame by foam strips. In addition, desired dynamic properties of the ribbon are achieved by fabricating the aluminum ribbon with corrugations that extend at variable slant angles relative to the longitudinal axis of the ribbon. The woofer acoustical transducer consists of an elon gated, trapezoidal shaped, corrugated aluminum ribbon that is supported on all sides and mounted vertically in a rigid, elongated frame. To provide a single electrical path through the ribbon it is divided by a series of horizontal cuts into a serpentine pattern. The ribbon is located directly in front of a rectangular array of ceramic magnets mounted on a steel backing sheet.
