# Flexible line vegetation trimmers.

## Abstract
A flexible line vegetation trimmer 1 is disclosed, wher ein the trimmer includes a conventional line cutting element mounted for rotation about an axis to define a cutting path, a debris shield 8 mounted above at least an arc of the cutting path, and a cutting blade 11 on the debris shield for cutting segments from the line to reduce the line length to a predete rmined distance. In this generally conventional line trimmer the present invention provides a cut line pocket 9 mounted below the debris shield 8 , and having the cutting blade 11 mounted at the mouth thereof, with the cutting pocket 9 catching the segments 50 of the line cut from the line by the cutting blade 11 . The cut segments 50 are trapped in the cut line pocket 9 , thereby reducing if not eliminating the danger of the cut segments 50 striking a person or animal in the vicinity of the operating line trimmer 1 .
