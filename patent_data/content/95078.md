## Description
SBBILI X OIFIN POLYMER COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE FOR PREPARING SHAPED ARRIVES This invention relates as indicated to stabilized olefin polymer compositions. More particularly it relates to such olefin polymer compositions which are stabilized against deterioration which ordinarily results from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light. Still more particularly, it relates to the stabilization of olefin polymer compositions as above by means of small proportions of certain additives. Ultraviolet light has a degradative effect on olefin polymers, the severity of which is dependent on the particular polymer and the geographical loca tion of exposure. The degradation may take the form of discoloration, loss of tensile and impact strength, distortion of initial flexibility, dimensional change, surface craze, cracking, powdering or increased electrical conductivity. All of these effects may result from the breaking of carbon to carbon bonds in the polymer chain followed by immediate oxidation of the chain fragments. It is well known that the addition of certain materials to an olefin polymer will impart a degree of stabilization to that polymer with respect to its resistance to the destructive forces of ultra violet radiation. These materials, in one instance, function as preferential acceptors of incident ultra violet radiation because they have a much higher affinity for such radiation than does the olefin polymer. It appears that they absorb harmful radiation and dissipate it as harmless energy. They thus form a protective shield for the polymer in which they are present. Although there are many types of ultraviolet stabilizers, an important class includes the 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles. They offer strong intensity and broad ultraviolet stabilization with a fairly sharp wavelength limit close to the visible region.They absorb light at 280 390 mm.which is the spectral region most harmful to polymer claims. Another important class of ultraviolet stabilizers are the hydroxybenzophenones. Oleo in polymers which are stabilized by an ultraviolet stabilizer frequently contain also an oxidation inhibitor. This is especially so where it is important to achieve light stable polymer compositions. A wide variety of antioxidants are available. U.S. 4,206,111 Valdiserri et al. shows the combination of certain 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, dialkylpentaerythritol diphosphites and phenolic ester oxidation inhibitors. The combination is an effective ultraviolet s abilizer in olefin polymers, being effective to extend the useful life of polypropylene, for example. U.S. 3,988,293 Mills deals with a stabilizer system for polyolefins. Polypropylene compositions are shown which contain stabilizing proportions of 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone and distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. Such compositions are shown to be resistant to breakage upon flexing, after prolonged exposure in a Weather Ometer at 180 . U.K. 1,526,603 shows a process for preparing bis dialkylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphites also shown is the use of such diphosphites in combination with a phenolic inhibitor to impart an enhanced thermal stability to polypropylene. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found that the effectiveness of certain known ultraviolet stabilizers, i.e., 2 hydrox ybenzotriazoles and hydroxybenzophenones, in olefin polymers is unexpectedly enhanced by the presence of small proportions of a bis dialkylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. The combination of these additives is effective to extend significantly the useful life of olefin polymers, for example, by many hours in aWeather Ometer. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The olefin polymers include homopolymers and copolymers of monoolefins, preferably those monoolefines containing 1 4 carbon atoms. Illustrative examples include polyethylene including low density, high density, ultra high molecular weight and linear low density polyethylene , polypropylene, EPDM polymers, ethylene propylene copolymers and polyisobutylene. The stabilization of mixtures of any of these olefin polymers and copolymers likewise is contemplated. The 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles contemplated herein are those which conform to the structural formulaEMI4.1 where R1 is lower alkyl or halogen preferably chlorine , R2 is lower alkyl, halogen preferably chlorine or hydrogen, and X is chlorine or hydrogen. Illustrative examples of such 2 hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles include 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 diter tiarybutylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole Tinuvin 327 , 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 dimethylphenyl benzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy 5 tertiarybutylphenyl benzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy 3 tertiarybutyl 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole Tinuvin 326 , 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole Tinuvin P , 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 dimethylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxy3 ,51 diter tiary octylphenyl benzotriazole Tinuvin 328 , 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl benzotriazole, and 2 2 hydroxy 3 methyl 5 tertiaryoct Ilphenyl benzo tria zole.The term lower alkyl denotes an alkyl group having 1 10 carbon atoms. Many of the benzotriazoles of this invention are available under the trademark designationTinuvin 326, 327 and 328, Tinuvin P, etc. See above. They may be prepared by coupling an aromatic diazo compound with an aromatic amine, followed by oxidation of the coupled intermediate. An illustrative preparation is as follows EMI5.1 Other methods of preparation are set out in U.S.3,004,896 Heller et al. and U.S. 3,189,615 Heller et al. . These benzotriazoles are used, for the purpose of this invention, in concentrations ranging from about 0.01 percent to about 5.0 percent. Best results are obtained at concentrations within the range of from about 0.1 percent to about 0.5 percent, based on the olefin polymer composition. The hydroxybenzophenone s comtempl ated above are those having the structureEMI5.2 where R is an alkyl group of 1 10 carbon atoms. The amounts of such hydroxybenzophenones which should be used in the olefin polymer compositions may range from about 0.01 to about 0.5 , based on the weight of the polymer composition. A preferred range, because of optimum effectiveness, is from about 0.08 to about 0.25 . The hydroxybenzophenone preferably is the one in which R in the above structural formula is n octyl, i.e., 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone. This group R, however, may, as indicated, be any alkyl group having 1 10 carbon atoms, and all such hydroxybenzophenones are contemplated herein. Illustrative R groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, 2 methylbutyl, 2 ethylhexyl, decyl and isodecyl groups. The bis dialkylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite component of the combination of the invention may be either the spiro or the caged isomer, i.e.,EMI6.1 SPIRO CAGED or it may be a mixture, in any proportion, of the two.R in the above equation is a dialkylphenyl group of which the alkyl has 3 9 carbon atoms. Such a mixture can be prepared from the reaction of a dialkylphenol as the source of R, with diphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, which in turn may be prepared by the reaction of triphenyl phosphite with pentaerythritol.The alkyl groups preferably are bulky, i.e., tertiary or secondary alkyl groups. Such alkyl groups include isopropyl, sec butyl, tertiarybutyl, n amyl, tertiaryamyl, n hexyl, 2,2 dimethylbutyl, 2 methyl 2 ethylpropyl, phenyl ethyl and tertiaryoctyl. The two alkyl groups are in the 2,4 positions or 2,6 positions. A particularly preferred species is bis 2,4 ditertiarybutylphenyl pentaeryth ritol diphosphite. Another preferred species is bis 2 ,6 ditertiarybutylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. The pentaerythritol diphosphite of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with the process described in U.K. Patent No. 1,526,603. That process is a transesterification . requiring the reaction, for example, of a dialkylphenol with diphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, phenol being split out as a by product. The reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures and proceeds best with a basic catalyst. The hydroxybenzophenones herein may be prepared by the reaction of benzotrichloride with resorcinol in an aqueous acidic environment, to yield the expected 2 hydroxybenzophenone, which then is etherified with an alkyl chloride such as octyl chloride in an alkaline medium to give the 2 hydroxy4 n octoxybenzophenone. The relative proportions of the pentaerythritol diphosphite used herein range from about 0.05 percent to about 1.0 percent, based on the olefin polymer. These stabilizing ingredients may be added to the olefin polymer in any conventional manner.They may, for example, be blended into the polymer as dry powders, or they may be dissolved in one or more solvents and sprayed onto finely divided polymer particles, or they may be blended as a melt in an extruder, or they may be mixed on a roll mill, or in aBanbury mixer. Other additives can also be added to the olefin polymer including fillers, pigments, antistatic agents and the like. Metal stearates, for example, are commonly added as lubricants, or as neutralizers, or to impart a measure of heat stability to the polymer composition. The olefin polymer compositions contemplated herein can be converted by extrusion, injection molding, blow molding and the like into a variety of molded objects, filaments, films, sheets, etc. The efficiency of these polymer compositions is shown by data obtained from Weather Ometer testing using a xenon arc as a source of ultraviolet radiation. Opaque test samples 3 x 2 x 30 mils are prepared by compression molding and suspended by clamps in an enclosed atmosphere at 11OF. For 20 minutes of each hour of the test period a thin spray of water is applied to the samples to simulate rainfall. The test samples are removed from theWeather Ometer at 100 hour intervals and inspected.The appearance of a crazed surface is taken as a failure of the sample and the number of hours elapsing from the beginning of the test until failure is a measure of the stability of the sample. The data from such test is shown in TableI. The samples each were 100.75 parts of high density polyethylene BDPE containing the additives herein, as shown TABLE ISample Nos. 1 2 3 4 5 6A 0.25 0.125 0.125B 0.125 0.125 C 0.125 0.125Rating 600 1800 900 1500 1800 3300A is 2 Hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenoneB is Distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite C is Bis 2,4 ditertiarybutylphenyl pentaeryth ritol diphosphite It will be seen that Sample No. 6, representing the invention, clearly is superior in its ultraviolet stability to Sample No. 5 which is the composition shown in U.S. 3,988,293 Mills . Moreover, an analysis of all the data above shows the unexpected synergism of the combination of additives of the invention. Additional test data also showing the efficacy of the polymer compositions herein are set out in Table II. The data is collected from tests carried out on 200 16 denier natural polypropylene multifilament. The fiber compositions are prepared by dry blending the various components and then extruding the mixture at 475OF. Fibers are spun at 5400F, drawn at a ratio of 7 1 and given one twist per inch. The test consists of exposure of the test fiber to conditions of ordinary weather in the Caribbean. The tenacity retention of the fibers is monitored and when 50 of the original tenacity is lost the sample is adjudged a failure.
