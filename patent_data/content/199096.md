## Description
This invention relates to nitropyrazinyl and nitropyridinyl substituted piperazin 3 one and hexahydro 1H 1,4 diazepin 5 one compounds used as sensitizers of tumor cells to therapeutic radiation. It also relates to the process of preparing such compounds by reaction of substituted piperazin 3 one and hexahydro 1H 1,4 diazepin 5 one compounds with certain specific chloronitropyrazines and chloronitropyridines defined hereinbelow. At the present time, certain other unrelated compounds are in experimental clinical use as radia tion sensitizers. However, these compounds for example, metronidazole and misonidazole suffer from the drawback that they also cause neurotoxicity which limits their usefulness. The compounds of the present invention are effective radiation sensi tizers, but are believed to have a more favorable therapeutic ratio. The compounds of the present invention are represented by the general formula The substituted compounds of the present invention are prepared in the following manner A lactam of the formula The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent such as a lower alcohol, a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetra methylurea, or others such as tetrahydrofuran, glyme, diglyme and pyridine. A preferred solvent for this reaction is isopropyl alcohol. The reaction mixture should also contain sufficient base to neutralize the hydrochloric acid formed during the reaction. This base may be in the form of an organic amine such as pyridine or triethylamine or inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate or hydroxide with organic bases being preferred. The temperature of the reaction is not critical and it is desirably maintained between 0 and 100 C and preferably between 0 and 25 C for a period of from 1 25 hours. The method of treatment of human patients or domestic animals undergoing radiation treatment of malignant disease processes employs the compounds of the present invention in pharmaceutical compositions that are administered orally or intravenously. The dose employed depends on the radiation protocol for each individual patient. In protocols where the radiation dose is divided into a large number of fractions, the drug can be administered at intervals in the schedule and not necessarily with each radiation treatment. It should be noted that the compounds of the present invention are not intended for chronic administration. In general, the drug is administered from 10 minutes to 5 hours prior to the radiation treatment in a dosage of between 0.25 to about 4.0 grams per square meter of body surface. The dosage range given is the effective dosage range and the decision as to the exact dosage used must be made by the administering physician based on his judgement of the patient s general physical condition. In determining the dose for the individual patient, the physician may begin with an initial dose of 0.25 g square meter of body surface to determine how well the drug is tolerated and increase the dosage with each suceeding radiation treatment, observing the patient carefully for any drug side effect. The composition to be administered is an effective amount of the active compound and a pharmaceutical carrier for said active compound. The dosage form for intravenous administration is a sterile isotonic solution. Oral dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, or elixirs are preferred. Capsules or tablets containing 25, 50, 100 or 500 mg of drug capsule or tablet are satisfactory for use in the method of treatment of our invention.
