# Dual alloy radial turbine rotors and methods for their manufacture.

## Abstract
A dual alloy radial turbine rotor 1 comprising a hub 2 made from a high tensile strength material and a blade ring 3 made from a high creep rupture strength material. The hub material is exposed in the saddle regions between the blades 4 to prevent fatigue that causes cracks in the saddle regions. This is achieved by producing the hub 2 with additional material at the outer portions of a frustoconical rear portions 28 of the hub 2 . After diffusion bonding of the outer surface 18 of the hub 2 to the mating inner surface of the blade ring, portions of the blade rim 8 in the saddle regions are machined away to produce finished saddle configurations with the high tensile strength hub material exposed.
