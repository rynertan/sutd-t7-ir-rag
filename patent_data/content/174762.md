# Fabrication of gas impervious edge seal for a bipolar gas distribution assembly for use in a fuel cell.

## Abstract
A bipolar gas reactant distribution assembly for use in a fuel cell is disclosed, the assembly having a solid edge seal 53 to prevent leakage of gaseous reactants wherein a pair of porous plates 45, 45a are provided with peripheral slits 49, 49a generally parallel to, and spaced apart from two edges of the plate, the slit 49, 49a being filled with a solid, fusible, gas impervious edge sealing compound. The plates 45, 45a are assembled with opposite faces adjacent one another with a layer of a fusible sealant material 54 therebetween the slits 49, 49a in the individual plates 45, 45a being approximately perpendicular to one another. The plates 45, 45a are bonded to each other by the simul taneous application of heat and pressure to cause a redistri bution of the sealant into the pores of the adjacent plate surfaces and to cause the edge sealing compound to flow and impregnate the region of the plates 45, 45a adjacent the slits 49, 49a and comingle with the sealant layer material 54 to form a continuous layer of sealant along the edges of the assembled plates 45, 45a .
