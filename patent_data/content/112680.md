# Bucket for material handling apparatus.

## Abstract
In a loader bucket having a back member pivotable on a boom assembly which is pivotable on a tractor and a front member pivotable on the back member, power operated means for effecting relative pivoting of the members have comprised two hydraulic piston and cylinder assemblies disposed at the respec tive ends of the bucket and fed from a common pressure line so as to work in unison. However, when gripping asymmetrical loads between the members the front member is distorted due to the pressure liquid taking the path of least resistance and thus permitting unequal extension of the piston and cylinder assemb lies. This problem is minimised by employing a single , central hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 31, 30 connected bet ween a point 13 on the back member and a lug 28 fixed to a torsion bar 23 which interconnects the ends 21 of the front member along its pivot axis. The gripping of asymmetrical loads then twists the torsion bar 23 within its elastic limit.
