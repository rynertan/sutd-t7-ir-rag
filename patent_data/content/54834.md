# Arc restricting device for a circuit breaker.

## Abstract
This invention provides a novel circuit breaker which is good in terms of both its current limiting performance and its interrupting performance. The contactors 2, 3 of the circuit breaker for opening and closing an electric circuit are equipped with arc shields 8 of a high resistivity material, disposed in a manner to surround the contacts 202, 302 thereof, and arc runways of higher conductivity than the arc shields 8 , and of predetermined heights and directions, are further provided in a manner so as to adjoin to the contacts 202, 302 .
