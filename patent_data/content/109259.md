# Method for production or activation of antimony containing metal oxide catalysts.

## Abstract
Antimony containing metal oxide catalysts are produced or activated by dry blending a a catalyst or catalyst precursor composed of an antimony containing metal oxides composi tion containing antimony and at least one element selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, cerium, uranium, tin, titanium, and copper, and b elemental antimony or an antimony compound, and contacting the com ponents a and b with each other at about 300 C to 1000 C in a non reducing gas atmosphere for a period sufficient for the elemental antimony or antimony compound b to deposit on the catalyst or catalyst precursor a .
