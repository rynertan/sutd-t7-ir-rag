## Description
The present invention relates to recombinant DNA having inserted therein a gene coding for phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, to bacteria carrying the recombinant DNA and to a process for producing amino acids using the bacteria. Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase 4.1.1.31 phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase hereafter referred to as PEPC is an enzyme which catalyzes the reaction of adding 1 mole of carbon dioxide to phosphoenol pyruvic acid, thereby forming oxaloacetic acid. As such, it plays an extremely important role in supplying aspartic acid by metabolic processes. Accordingly, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase also plays an important role in the production of amino acids, such as lysine, threonine, isoleucine, etc., which are formed from aspartic acid. In addition, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase plays an important role in the production of amino acids formed from TCA cycle organic acids that is, amino acids such as glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, arginine, citrulline, ornithine, etc. from the oxaloacetic acid that is formed by adding carbon dioxide to phosphoenol pyruvic acid. The production of amino acids by the use of transformed bacteria has been already described in the prior art. EP A 0 088 166, a document pursuant to Article 54 3 and 4 , teaches to produce L glutamic acid by using a recombinant DNA obtained by inserting the PEPC gene of E. coli into pBR322 plasmid or by using the recombinant DNA obtained from the Corynebacterium glutamicum strain K 18 ATCC 39033 , which is the ligation product of the above mentioned recombinant plasmid with the plasmid pCG11 obtained from Corynebacterium glutamicum LA 103 pCG11 ATCC 39022 . Furthermore, GB 2 076 853 discloses L glutamic acid producing microorganisms which are constructed by incorporating into a recipient strain of the genera Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium a hybrid plasmid having inserted therein a DNA fragment possessing genetic information relating to L glutamic acid production, which fragment is derived from a donor strain of the genera Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium. However, this document does not suggest the cloning of PEPC gene nor to use PEPC gene in order to transform a mutant of a Corynebacterium, which is dependent on a specific amino acid, with a recombinant plasmid comprising this specific gene. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a method of increasing the production of amino acids using phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase. This and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been accomplished by providing a recombinant DNA molecule formed of a plasmid vector and a gene coding for phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase operationally inserted therein, said gene being obtainable from bacteria resistant to aspartic acid ant A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein The present inventors started their investigations with an attempt to amplify PEPC genes in cells of bacteria which are known to produce high amounts of amino acids, e.g., in cells of Corynebacterium glutamicum or Brevibacterium flavum. Ultimately, the present inventors succeeded in obtaining a recombinant DNA comprising a plasmid vector and a gene coding for PEPC from cells of Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium bacteria along with Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium bacteria carrying the recombinant DNA. Cultivation of such bacteria results in production of markedly high amounts of amino acids excreted into the culture medium. Coryneform bacteria are aerobic, Gram positive rods, are non acid fast, and are described in Bergey s Isolation of the PEPC gene can be conducted, for example, by the following method. Although the following example refers only to Coryneform bacteria for simplicity, it is to be recognized that Brevibacterium bacteria can likewise be used at any or all points in the procedure. Firstly, a chromosomal gene is extracted from a Coryneform strain carrying a healthy PEPC gene there can be utilized, for example, the method of H. Saito and K. Miura, Preferred donors of the PEPC gene are strains which exhibit diminished feedback inhibition by aspartic acid. Such strains are recognized as being bacteria resistant to aspartic acid antagonistic inhibitors. To cleave chromosomal genes, a wide variety of restriction enzymes can be employed by controlling the degree of cleavage, for example, by controlling the time of the cleavage reaction, the temperature, etc. Cleavage of DNA by restriction enzymes is well understood by those skilled in the art and need not be set forth here in detail. The plasmid vector used in the present invention can be any vector as long as it can be propagated in cells of Coryneform or Brevibacterium bacteria except of pBR322 in the case of inserting a PEPC gene of E.coli. Specific examples include the following Other examples of plasmids capable of propagating in cells of Coryneform bacteria include pCG 1 Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 57 134500 , pCG 2 Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 58 35197 , pCG 4, pCG 11 Japanese Published Unexamined Application 57 183799 . All such plasmids are employable in the practice of this invention. The vector DNA is cleaved by the same restriction enzyme used for cleavage of the chromosomal gene or is connected to an oligonucleotide having a complementary base sequence at the respective terminals of the chromosomal DNA cleavage fragment and the cleaved vector DNA. The plasmid vector and the chromosomal gene containing fragment are then subjected to a ligation reaction. When a gene is inserted by this or any other method in the sense direction and in proper reading frame so that the PEPC enzyme is expressed when the plasmid is transcribed and translated by the genetic machinery of a cell in which the plasmid is inserted, the gene is said to be operationally inserted into the plasmid vector. The incorporation of the thus obtained recombinant DNA formed of the chromosomal DNA and the vector plasmid into recipients belonging to Coryneform and Brevibacterium bacteria can be accomplished by a method which comprises treating the recipient cells with calcium chloride to increase the permeability of DNA, as is reported regarding In the protoplast method, a sufficiently high frequency can be obtained even by the method used for To obtain PEPC deficient strains, glutamic acid auxotrophs are isolated, since the pathway via PEPC is a main pathway for metabolism of organic acids in the TCA Tricarboxylic acid cycle. More specifically, among the glutamic acid auxotrophs, the PEPC deficient strains can be obtained as strains which cannot grow on a minimum medium containing 5 µg 1 of biotin but grow on a medium containing 500 µg l of biotin. After transformation, bacterial strains that acquire PEPC productivity or express other properties further possessed by the plasmid vectors as markers are isolated as the desired transformants. Such transformants carry the recombinant DNAs harboring the PEPC gene. To isolate the recombinant DNA, for example, bacteria are lysed by treatment with lysozyme and sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS . After treatment with phenol, a 2 fold volume of ethanol is added to thereby precipiate and recover DNAs. In many cases, the PEPC deficient strains carrying the aforesaid recombinant DNAs produce a variety of amino acids by themselves. In order to obtain amino acid producing bacteria having high productivity, however, transformation with the recombinant DNA may be done using strains already having high productivity of desired amino acids. Representative examples of such recombinant DNA recipients include the following auxotrophs for homoserine when lysine producing bacteria are the target organism 2 thiazolealanine resistant bacteria in the production of arginine using S 2 aminoethyl cysteine resistant strains, etc. α amino β hydroxyvaleric acid resistant strains in the production of threonine α amino β hydroxyvaleric acid resistant strains in the production of isoleucine 2,4 dehydroproline resistant strains in the production of proline and keto maleic acid tolerant strains in the production of glutamic acid, etc. The methods of culturing the L amino acid producing bacteria thus obtained are conventional and are similar to the methods for the cultivation of conventional L amino acid producing bacteria. That is, the culture medium can be a conventional medium containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and inorganic ions and, when required, minor organic nutrients such as vitamines and amino acids. Examples of carbon sources include glucose, sucrose, lactose and starch hydrolysates containing them whey molasses etc. Examples of nitrogen sources include gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, ammonium salts and other nitrogen containing inorganic and organic compounds. Cultivation is conducted under aerobic conditions in which the pH and the temperature of the medium are adjusted to a suitable level, and cultivation is continued until the formation and accumulation of L amino acids cease. Thus, markedly high amounts of L amino acids are formed and accumulated in the culture medium. To recover L amino acids from the culture medium, any of the known conventional manners is applicable. In addition to the above general procedures which can be used for preparing amino acid producing bacteria in accordance with the practices of this invention, other known techniques and modifications thereof can be used in carrying out the practice of the invention. In particular, techniques relating to genetic engineering have recently undergone exclusive growth and development. Many recent U.S. patents disclose plasmids, genetically engineered microorganisms, and methods of conducting genetic engineering which can be used in the practice of the present invention. For example, U.S. Patent 4,273,875 discloses a plasmid and a process of isolating the same. U.S. Patent 4,304,863 discloses a process for producing bacteria by genetic engineering in which a hybrid plasmid is constructed and used to transform a bacterial host. U.S. Patent 4,419,450 discloses a plasmid useful as a cloning vehicle in recombinant DNA work. U.S. Patent 4,362,867 discloses recombinant cDNA construction methods and hybrid nucleotides produced thereby which are useful in cloning processes. U.S. Patent 4,403,036 discloses genetic reagents for generating plasmids containing multiple copies of DNA segments. U.S. Patent 4,363,877 discloses recombinant DNA transfer vectors. U.S. patent 4,356,270 discloses a recombinant DNA cloning vehicle and is a particularly useful disclosure for those with limited experience in the area of genetic engineering since it defines many of the terms used in genetic engineering and the basic processes used therein. U.S. Patent 4,336,336 discloses a fused gene and a method of making the same. U.S Patent 4,349,629 discloses plasmid vectors and the production and use thereof. U.S. Patent 4,332,901 discloses a cloning vector useful in recombinant DNA. Although some of these patents are directed to the production of a particular gene product that is not within the scope of the present invention, the procedures described therein can easily be modified by utilizing a PEPC gene in place of the gene described specifically in the patents. All of these patents as well as all other patents and other publications cited in this disclosure are indicative of the level of skill of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains and are all herein incorporated by reference. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. Using pAJ 43 molecular weight, 3.4 megadaltons as a vector, its DNAs were prepared from pAJ 655 and pBR 325 as follows Plasmid pAM 330 was obtained by culturing After treating DNAs with ribonuclease reacted with 150 µg ml of ribonuclease at 37 C for 30 minutes , DNAs were extracted with phenol. Then, a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added thereto to precipitate DNAs at 20 C. The precipitates were dissolved in 1 ml of a TEN buffer solution. The DNA solution was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. From the gel, about 74 µg of pure plasmid DNAs were isolated. Plasmid pAJ 655 was prepared as follows. One unit of restriction enzyme BamH I purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories BRL was reacted with 0.2 µg of plasmid pBR 325 Boliver, F., Restriction enzyme Mbo I, 0.2 unit, was reacted with 1.2 µg of plasmid pAM 330 at 37 C for 15 minutes to partially decompose its DNAs. The thus obtained DNA fragments were mixed, and the mixture was heat treated at 65 C for 10 minutes to inactivate the restriction enzyme. Thereafter, 0.01 unit of T₄ DNA ligase was reacted with the DNA fragments at 22 C for 2 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. T₄ DNA ligase was inactivated by treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes. After a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added thereto, DNAs were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 minutes. The thus obtained composite plasmids were used for transformation. The transformants were cultured at 37 C for 24 hours in a CMG medium containing 20 µg ml of chloramphenicol and selected. From the transformants, AJ 11882 FERM BP 136 was selected and used in the following experiment. The composite plasmid pAJ 655 was isolated from the lysate of AJ 11882 by the following method After culturing AJ 11882 in a CMG medium, it was lysed by the conventional method of Tanaka et al., The plasmid pAJ 43 was prepared from pAJ 655 as follows From the high concentration chloramphenicol resistant transformants obtained as the above results, pAJ 43 DNA was prepared as follows. Firstly, this strain was inoculated on 1 liter of CMG liquid medium containing 10 µg ml of chloramphenicol and cultured at 30 C to reach a late exponential growth phase, at which time the cells were harvested. After the cells were lysed by lysozyme and SDS in a conventional manner, they were supercentrifuged at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes to obtain the supernatant. Polyethylene glycol final concentration 10 was added to the supernatant to precipitate DNAs. After concentration, the precipitates were dissolved in 10 ml of tris EDTA NaCl buffer. After treating DNAs with ribonuclease reacted with 150 µg ml of ribonuclease at 37 C for 30 minutes , DNAs were extracted with phenol. Then a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added to precipitate DNAs at 20 C. The precipitates were dissoved in 1 ml of tris EDTA NaCl buffer. The DNA solution was applied to agarose gel electrophoresis voltage 5 V per 1 cm of gel, 15 hours to fractionate and harvest 150 µg of pure pAJ 43 plasmid. The properties of pAJ 43 DNA are as follows Preparation of restriction map of pAJ 43 DNA A commercially available group of restriction enzymes from BRL was used, and cleavage of pAJ 43 DNA with the restriction enzyme was performed under the conditions indicated for respective enzymes, using at least a 3 fold excess amount of enzyme. When plasmid DNA was cleaved with at least one restriction enzyme for purpose of preparing a restriction map, a fragment cleaved with the first restriction enzyme was isolated by the method of Tanaka et al T. Tanaka., B. Weisblum, Measurement of copy number of pAJ 43 Chromosomal DNAs, 20 µg, obtained in 1 and 10 µg of plasmid DNAs were treated at 37 C for 1 hour with the restriction endonuclease Hind III, respectively, to fully cleave them. After heat treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes, both reaction liquids were mixed, and the mixture was subjected to a ligation reaction between the DNA chains with DNA ligase derived from T₄ phage at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. After heat treatment at 65 C for 5 minutes, a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added to the reaction liquid to precipitate and harvest DNAs produced by the ligation reaction. As a method for transformation, the protoplast transformation method was used. Firstly, the strain was cultured in 5 ml of CMG liquid medium to reach an early exponential growth phase. After adding 0.6 unit ml of penicilline G thereto, shake culture was performed for further 1.5 hour. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of SMMP medium pH 6.5 composed of 0.5M sucrose, 20 mM maleic acid, 20 mM magnesium chloride and 3.5 Penassay broth Difco Company . Then, the cells were suspended in SMMP medium containing 10 mg ml of lysozyme to cause protoplastation at 30 C for 20 hours. After centrifugation at 6000 x g for 10 minutes, the protoplasts were washed with SMMP and resuspended in 0.5 ml of SMMP. The thus obtained protoplasts were mixed with 10 µg of DNAs prepared in 3 in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. After polyethylene glycol was added to the mixture to reach a final concentration of 30 , the mixture was allowed to stand for 2 minutes at room temperature to incorporate DNAs into the protoplasts. After washing the protoplasts with 1 ml of SMMP medium, the protoplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of SMMP medium. The suspension was incubated at 30 C for 2 hours to effect phenotypic expression. The culture liquid was spread on protoplast regeneration medium of pH 7.0. The protoplast regeneration medium contained, per one liter of distilled water, 12 g of tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, 0.5 g of KCl, 10 g of glucose, 8.1 g of MgCl₂ 6H₂O, 2.2 g of CaCl₂ 2H₂O, 4 g of peptone, 4 g of powdered yeast extract, 1 g of Casamino acid Difco Company , 0.2 g of K₂HPO₄, 10 g of glutamic acid, 500 µg of biotin, 135 g of sodium succinate, 8 g of agar and 3 µg ml of chloramphenicol. After cultivation at 30 C for 2 weeks, approximately 500 colonies resistant to chloramphenicol appeared, which were replicated in a glutamic acid free medium Glu deficient medium 2 glucose, 1 ammonium sulfate, 0.25 urea, 0.1 dihydrogen potassium phosphate, 0.04 magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 2 ppm iron ions, 2 ppm manganese ions, 200 µg 1 thiamine hydrochloride and 5 µg l biotin pH 7.0, agar 1.8 to obtain a strain resistant to chloramphenicol and having lost auxotrophy for glutamic acid. This strain was named AJ 12066 FERM P 7176 . AJ 12066 was treated in a manner described in 2 to prepare the lysate. Plasmid DNAs were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmids having a molecular weight of 10.5 megadaltons obviously larger than that of vector pAJ 43 were detected. The recombinant plasmids were named pAJ 200. A restriction map of pAJ 200 is shown in Fig. 8. In order to confirm that the PEPC gene was present on the recombinant plasmid containing the DNA fragment of 7.1 megadaltons detected in 5 , From each of the thus formed chloramphenicol resistant colonies, 30 strains were selected. Examination of auxotropy for glutamic acid indicated that the auxotrophy was removed in all of the colonies, and it became clear that the PEPC genes were present on the recombinant plasmids described above. The plasmids described above were very unstable. A strain carrying miniaturized, stable plasmids was therefore prepared. In protoplast transformation of Coryneform bacteria, introduction of a plasmid having a large molecular weight sometimes results in partial omission of the DNA chains to cause miniaturization of the plasmid. As the result of examination of plasmids on 100 retransformants, miniaturized plasmids were detected in 8 strains. These miniaturized plasmids were stably maintained in the strains. From one of the strains, plasmids were prepared in high amounts, which were named pAJ 201. A restriction map of pAJ 201 is shown in Fig. 7. Transformant AJ 12065 FERM P 7175 , recipient AJ 12061 and wild strain ATCC 13869, which was an original strain of them, were shake cultured for 48 hours in glutamic acid producing medium glucose, 8 g dl KH₂PO₄, 0.1 g dl MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.1 g dl FeSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.001 g dl MnSO₄ 4H₂O, 0.001 g dl urea, 0.4 g dl thiamine hydrochloride, 200 µg l biotin, 3 µg l and soybean hydrolysate, 36 mg dl as total nitrogen adjusted to pH 6.8 , while adjusting pH by the urea addition method. The thus obtained cells were suspended in tris buffer of pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M ammonium sulfate. After ultrasonic treatment, the suspension was centrifuged at 32,000 x g for 30 minutes to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was treated with ammonium sulfate to remove low molecular weight substances. The PEPC activity was measured with the supernatant using an enzyme reaction liquid composed of 100 mM tris hydrochloride pH 7.5 , 2 mM phosphoenol pyruvic acid, 3.3 mM MnSO₄, 10 mM NaHCO₃, 0.1 mM acetyl CoA, 0.15 mM NADH and 10 µg malate dehydrogenase. The reaction was performed in a colorimetric cell. Incremental oxaloacetic acid production was quantitatively assayed by determining the rate of decrease of NADH by measuring the extinction coefficient at 366 nm. The results are shown in Table 1. Plasmid pAJ 201 was introduced into Plasmid pAJ 201 was introduced into Plasmid pAJ 201 was introduced into Plasmid pAJ 201 was introduced into Plasmids would be removed from most of the colonies appearing on the medium with a high degree of probability.

The deposits identified as FERM P numbers 6857, 7176, 7175, 7177, 7172, 7205, 7173, and 7174 were converted on August The invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as set forth herein.
