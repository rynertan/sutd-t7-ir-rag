## Description
EXHAUST SILENCER SYSTEMThis invention relates to an exhaust silencer system, and to a method of exhaust silencing for use in an exhaust system for prime movers. i.e., engines. of any type combustion, chemical or gaseous for achieving a force output which may be motive or otherwise. The invention has particular utilities in respect of the engines of motor cycles.Exhaust systems for power engines set out to achieve both silencing of the noise generated by the exhaust gases and exhaust assistance to improve available power output from the engine. Exhaust silencers are conventionally made up of a series of interconnected chambers each specifically tuned i.e of chosen length, shape and internal design geometry to reduce either discrete frequencies, or a series of frequencies and harmonics. of noise emission from the engine to which the exhaust is coupled.There are many alternative, or additional. ways of achieving a reduction in noise from an engine. This invention is particularly concerned with sound attenuation of the higher frequency noise emissions from the engine. Conventionally, and especially in the case of motorcycles, such high frequency attenuation is achieved via a filling of fibre giass or of similar fibrous material. packed concentrically between a central perforated exhaust barrel and an outer solid exhaust casing. Two inter related problems can , however, occur when this technique is used.Firstly, effective high frequency attenuation within the system diminishes over a period of use as a result of pulsing frequencies set up from the engine and of accumulations of solid products of combustion. This deterioration results in the exhaust becoming noisier and less efficient.Secondly. the consequent degradation of fibrous packing may also depending on design details result in fibre emission from the system, so reducing the sound attenuation even further with use. Current European and prospective U.K legislation requires that such fibrous loss from exhaust systems which use fibre glass or any other fibrous material should be recorded and limited to a specific value for a given pulsation test. It is likely that such requirements will become more. rather than less, stringent in the coming years whereby more rigorous design and quality control techniques will need to be adopted by the manufacturer. The present invention sets out to provide a method and equipment for achieving high frequency sound attenuation within an exhaust system without the use of fibrous material. thus eliminating the problems of fibre degradation and emission.In one aspect the invention consists in an engine exhaust system of the type in which at least one generally annular sound attenuation chamber 2, 3, 4 surrounds a perforated pipe 1 permitting transmission of exhaust gases characterised in that said chamber 2.3, 4 is packed with wound coherent metallic or non metallic material 5 possessing, and or defining by virtue of its windings, voids Sa to permit gas flow and alteration of the sound attenuation characteristics of the assembly.The wound coherent member could conceivably be a wire.or metal strip loosely wound generally helically within the space around the pipe. Preferably, however. it is a perforated metal sheet. In either case it will define a plurality of voids of different effective sizes.Definite planar openings such as circular orifices are preferable but expanded slit type of orificed metal sheet can be used. The sheet or sheets will generally be wound more or less spirally, possibly ds a two start or multi start spiral utilising two or more of identical or different sheets. The invention is particularly applicable to motorcycle engines. since these are typically built to operate with high engine revolutions and thus generate more noise and of higher frequencies. In particular, a final exhaust section final or otherwise for a motorcycle can utilise the present invention. Normally two stroke engines are envisaged but the invention also operates with four stroke engines.The invention further extends to a method of engine silencing using such an expedient.The invention will be further described by way of for example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. in which Figure 1 is a section through one embodiment of part of an exhaust system according to the invention.Figure 2 is a section orthogonal to the section ofFigure 1.A perforated tube 1, preferably although not necessarily of cylindrical cross section as shown is mounted by means of end plates 2 and 3 within an outer tube 4, again preferably although not necessarily of cylindrical cross section. The end plates 2 and 3,, at the upstream and downstream ends of the chamber respectively, are so formed that the annulus or chamber defined between the perforated tube 1 and the outer tube 4, when viewed in section, is sealed so leaving only the inner opening of perforated tube 1 available for ingress and egress of exhaust gases.Within the annular chamber so defined there is positioned a sheet of material 5 with perforated holes 5a throughout rolled or formed into a spiral such that the outside dimensions of the spiral are less than the outer tube 4 and the inner dimensions of the spirals are greater than the outer dimension of perforated tube 1. The aforementioned perforated spiral 5 may also be formed by any appropriate means such as for instance from wire gauze or a sintered mesh.Chambers 6 and 7 are shown at the upstream and downstream ends respectively of a packed chamber. These are included by way of example to show the coupling of other chambers to the chamber adapted in accordance with the present invention such further chambers would usually be necessary in some form to achieve a complete silencing system.Figure 2 is a section through one embodiment of the silencer chamber according to the invention showing the spirally wound sheet 5, the inner perforated tube 1, and downstream end plate 3 fixed within the cylindrical chamber 4. The spiral and other components may be similarly formed in any practical cross section. e.g square. recdngular or elliptical. Also, the spiral need not necessarily comprise a single winding but may be embodied in the silencer by a variety of practical means such as rouble start concentric spirals or several spiral tubes each of outer diameter sufficiently small so as to be arranged to fit between the annular chamber formed between tubes 1 and 4.All of the aforementioned individual components may be varied in materials. length. diameter and cross sectional shape in order to form a chamber to match the exhaust system acoustically to the performance characteristics of any engine. More specifically, the sectional shape and cross section dimensions throughout the length of the chamber may vary for each specific application. Similarly. the length between the two plates 2 and 3 and the tightness or pitch of the coiled plate 5 and hole geometry may be varied to match the requirements of the engine to which the overall exhaust system is fixed. In this manner different degrees of attenuation in differing wave bands may be selected and achieved. By way of specific example, the chamber 2, 3, 4 may be a sheet steel construction, of overall extended length diameter ratio between 1 1 and 5 1 e.g between 2 1 and 4 1 preferably near or at 2 1 and thickness 1 2 mm., external diameter about 75 mm. It may contain a wound spiral 5, of about 3 4 turns. of similar steel containing holes 5a of 3 5 mm diameter with centres on a square grid of about 6 mm. The central exhaust tube 1 can be 20 mm outside diameter, 2 mm. thick, with 3 5 mm diameter holes in sets of four mutually facing at 900 to each other at 6 mm spacing, i.e. with more hole space than metal. Although shown in sets of four mutually at 900, the holes can in practice adopt other configurations. Such an exhaust system could be utilised on, for example a Yamaha RD 250 LC motorcycle. An advantage of the invention is that involving an assembly rather than a fibrous packing, it permits chromium plating of the exterior of the section, which is technically difficult with fibre packed exhaust systems.
