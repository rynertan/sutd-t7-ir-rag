# A resistively heatable photothermographic element.

## Abstract
Photothermographic imaging elements are provided with strippable layers which have electrical resistance in the range of 80 to 1500 ohms square. The elements may be exposed to radiation and then thermally developed by applying a voltage across the strippable layer which becom es resistively heated. After development, the strippable layer may be removed.
