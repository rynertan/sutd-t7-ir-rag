# Permanent magnet biased narrow track magnetoresistive transducer.

## Abstract
A narrow track magnetoresistive transducer has a square shaped bias permanent magnet 44 superposed with an MR element 40 . The square shaped magnet provides bias field components of substantially the same magnitude in both hard and easy axis directions of the MR element. A stable and uniform bias field is thereby obtained.
