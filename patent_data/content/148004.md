## Description
Cephalosporin Antibiotics This invention relates to improvements in or relating to cephalosporins. More particularly it relates to new cephalosporin compounds and derivatives thereof having valuable antibiotic activity. The cephalosporin compounds in this specification are named with reference to to ceph after J.Emer.Chem. Soc., 1962, 84, 3400, the term cephem referring to the basic cepham structure with one double bond Cephalosporin antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria in human beings and animals, and are especially useful in the treatment of diseases caused by bacteria which are resistant to other antibiotics such as penicillin compounds, and in the treatment of penicillinsensitive patients.In many instances it is desirable to employ a cephalosporin antibiotic which exhibits activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms, and a significant amount of research has been directed to the development of various types of broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotics Thus, for example in our British Patent Specifi cation No. 1399086, we describe a novel class of cephalosporin antibiotics containing a 7ss alpha etherified oxyimino acylamido group, the oxyimino group having the snm configuration.This class of antibiotic compounds is characterised by high antibacterial activity against a range of Gram positive and Gramnegative organisms coupled with particularly high stability to 8 lactamases produced by various Gramnegative organisms. The discovery of this class of compounds has stimulated further research in the same area in attempts to fina compounds which have improved properties, for example against particular classes of organisms especially Gram negative organisms.This interest is reflected in the very large numbers of patent applications which have been filed relating to cephalosporin antibiotics having particular oxyimino etherifying groups in combination with particular substituents both on the 7ss acylamido side chain and at the 3 position of the cephalosporin nucleus. British Patent Specification No. 1604371 generically defines a wide variety of cephalosporin compaunds in which the side chain may be selected from, inter alia, a 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 etherified oxyimino acetamido group in which the etherifying group, amongst very many possible meanings, may be a substituted methyl group, although the preferred etherifying group is an unsubstituted methyl group. The inethyl group substituents, where present7 may include inter alia a cycloalkyl, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl or cyano group, The 3 position group may also be selected from a large number of alternatives, European Patent Application No. 88320 contains a generic definition of a wide variety of cephalosporin antibiotics in which the aside chain may be selected from, inter alia, a 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 etherified oxyimino acetamido group. The 3 position group is an optionally substituted pyridiniummethyl group.The definition of the oxyimino etherifying group includes, among very many possibilities, cycloalkyl methyl which may be substituted at the 1 position of the cycloalkyl ring by a substituent selected from carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, cyano and optionally substituted carbamoyl. However, there is no specific exemplification of compounds having such groups, and in particular no reference to a cyclopropylmethyl etherifying group carrying such substituents. We have now discovered that by the selection of a Z 2 etherified oxyimino acetamido group at the 7ss position the said group being substituted at the 2 position thereof by a 2 aminothiazol 4yl group in combination with certain particular groups as herein defined at the 3 position of the cephalosporin nucleus, and by the selection of a cyclopropylmethoxyimino gronp substituted by a carboxyl alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, substitsted carbamoyl or cyano group as the etherified oxyimino grouping, cephalosporin compounds having a particularly advantageous profile of activity described in more detail below again a wide range of commonly encountered pathogenic organisms may be obtained According to one aspect of the invention we provide cEph compounds of general muia EMI3.1 wherein Q represents a cyclopropylmethyl group Y represents a carboxyl or blocked carboxyl group, a carbamoyl, N C1 4 alkyl carbamoyl orN,N di C1 4 alkyl carbamoyl group or a cyano group Z represents a hydrogen atom a carbamoyloxy group optionally substituted on the nitrogen atom by a C1 4 alkyl or C1 4 haloalkyl group an N protected carbamoyloxy group a group of formula SZ a wherein z is a carbon linked 5 or 6 membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring containing at least one nitrogen atom, which ring may also contain one or more sulphur atoms and or may be substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C14 alkyl, oxo, hydroxy or carbamoyloxymethyl groups a pyridinium group which may optionally be substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen atoms and carbamoyl, hydroxymethyl andC1 4 alkoxy groups or a bicyclic pyridinium group of formulaEMI4.1 wherein R represents an optionally substitutedC2 5 hydrocarbon chain which is saturated or contains one or two double boots and which may optionally be interrupted by a heteroatom RÚ represents an amino or protected amino group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl blocking group B is S or S O alpha or ss and the dotted line bridging the 2 , 3 and 4 positions indicates that the compound is a ceph 2 em or ceph 3 em compound and salts thereof It will be understood that the term salt used herein, both in connection with compounds of general formula I and with intermediates used in their preparation, includes within its scope external and internal salts. External salts may, for example, be base salts or may be acid addition salts formed with e.g a mineral or organic acid. Internal salt8 may for example take the form of zwitterions or betaines. For pharmaceutical use, salts may be non toxic salts but other salts may find use, for example in the preparation of compounds to be used as pharmaceuticals. It will be appreciated that the group Z may carry a positive charge, e.g. when Z is a pyridinium or bicyclic pyridinium group or a group of formula sza, and when this is the case the positive charge must be balanced by a negative charge. Thus the compounds may Ire betaines, so that the negative charge is provided by a ZCOOe group. Alternatively, the negative charge may be provided by an anion A . In compounds to be used in medicine such an anion will be non toxic and may be derived from any of the acids described below which will form non toxic salt derivatives. The compounds according to the invention are syn isomers The syn isomeric form is defined by the configuration of the O.Q.Y group with respect to the carboxamido group. in this Specification, the ssn configuration is denoted structurally asEMI5.1 It will be understood that since the compounds according to the invention are geometric isomers, some admixture with the corresponding anti isomer may occur. The invention also includes within its scope the solvates especially the hydrates of the compounds of formula I . It also includes within its scope the solvates of salts of compounds of formula 1 . It will be appreciated that where the compounds are to be used in medicine, the solvates should be pharmacologically acceptable. It will be appreciated that the group Q in the compounds of the invention may be substituted by the group Y at any part of the cyclopropylmethyl skeleton. For the avoidance of doubt, the following convention is used herein for identifying the substituent positions on the cyclopropylmethyl group EMI6.1 When the carbon atom at the alpha position carries a substituent, the carbon atom may be in the R or the S configuration. The invention covers the inaividual enantiomeric forms as well as including racemic mixtures. When the group Y in the compounds of the invention represents a blocked carboxyl group this may for example be an esterified carboxyl group, as discussed in more detail below When the group z represents a group of formula sz , the heterocyclic ring represented by a may for example contain I to 4 nitrogen atoms and, if desired, a sulphur atom particular examples of these heterocyclic groups include imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridylt pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazinyl and thiazolidinyl.The heterocyclic ring may, if desired, be substituted by one or more for example one to three C14 alkyl e.g. methyl , oxo, hydroxy or carbamoylmethyl groupsAlkyl or carbamoylmethyl substituents may be attached for example, to the nitrogen heteroatom s . In the heterocyclic ring represented by Za one nitrogen atom may be quaternised. When Z represents a bicyclic pyridinium group in which the C2 5 hydrocarbon chain is interrupted by a heteroatom, the said heteroatom may, for example, by an oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur atom. When Z represents a bicyclic pyridinium group, this may for example be a 2,3 cyclopentenopyridinium group. One group of compounds of formula I of interest is the group of compounds in which Z represents an optionally substituted pyridinium group or a bicyclic pyridinium group as defined above with the exception of compounds in which Z represents an optionally substituted quinolinium or isoquinolinium group, and the cyclopropylmethyl group Q carries substituent Y at the 1 position. When the group Z in the compounds of the invention represents an N protected carbamoyloxymethyl group, this group Z may be a group of formula 3. O.CO.NHR where R is a conventional N protecting group such as, for example, a labile group such as an acryl group, especially a lower alkanoyl group such as acetyl, a halo substituted lower alkanoyl group such as mono , di or tri chloroacetyl, a ehloro or bromo suiphonyl group, or a halogenated alkoxycarbonyl group such as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl. When the group R1 in the compounds of the invention represents a protected amino group1 this may for example be an amino group protected using a conventional protective group, as discussed in more detail below. When the group Rê in the compounds of the invention represents a carboxyl blocking group, this, or the carboxyl blocking group in Y when this group represents a blocked carboxyl group, may for example be the residue of an ester forming aliphatic or araliphatic alcohol or an ester forming phenol, silanol or stannanol the said alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol preferably containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a symmetrical or mixed anhydride blocking group derived from an appropriate acid. Where the compound is to be used in medicine any ester function R2 should be a non toxic metabolically labile ester function, as discussed in more detail below. Certain ceph 3 em compounds of formula I and the non toxic salts thereof, exhibit interesting biological properties as described in detail below and are therefore preferred compounds of the invention,These compounds may be represented by the general formulaEMI8.1 wherein Q and Z are as defined above, and ya is a carboxyl, C2 5 alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, N C1 4 alkyl carhamoyl, N,N di C1 4 alkyl carbamoyl or cyano group and non toxic salts including zwitterionic and betain forms and non toflc meta bolically labile esters thereof. Other compounds according to the invention, e.g. compounds in which B1 is a protected amino group, may however be intermediates useful in the preparation of the active compounds. The preferred compounds of general formulaIa as defined above include those in which Z represents a pyridinium group. Intermediates such as e.g. ceph 2 em, sulphoxide and protected intermediates are useful in the preparation of the active compounds of the invention. The compounds according to the present invention may exist in tautomeric forms for example in respect of the 2 aminothiazolyl group and it will be understood that such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the invention. Examples of non toxic metabolically labile ester derivatives include acyloxyalkyl esters, e.g. lower alkanoyloxy methyl or ethyl esters such as acetoxy methyl or ethyl or pivaloyloxymethyl esters, and alkoxycarbanyloxyalkyl esters1 e.g.lower alkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters such as the ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl ester In addition to the above ester derivatives, the present iiivention includes within its scope the active compounds of the invention in the form of other physiologically acceptable equivalents, i.e. physiologically acceptable compounds which, like the metabolically laitxile esters, are converted in vivo into the parent antibiotic compounds of the invention. Non toxic salt derivatives wich may be formed by reaction of any carboxyl group present in the compounds of formula I , or by reaction of any acidic hydroxyl group which may be present on the group z, include inorganic base salts such as alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts and alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium salts amino acid salts e.g. lysine and arginine salts and other organic base salts e.g. procaine, phenyl ethylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, ethanolmine, diethanolamine and N methylglucosamine salts .Other non toxic salt derivatives include acid addition salts, e.g. formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, formic and trifluoroacetic acids. Where appropriate, the compounds may also, as indicated above, be in zwitterionic i.e. internal salt form. The salts maw also be in the form of resinates formed with, for example, a polystyrene resin ar cross linked polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer resin containing amino or quaternary amino groups or sulphonic acid groups, or with a resin containing carboxyl groups, e.g. a polyacrylic acid resin.Soluble base salts e.g. alkali metal salts such as the sodium saLt of the compounds of formula Ia may be used in therapeutic applications because of the rapid distribntion of suck salts in the body upon administration Where, however, insoluble salts of compounds Ia are desired in a particular application, e.g. for use in depot preparations1 such salts may be formed in conventional manner, for example with appropriate organic amino Active compounds according to the invention exhibit broad spectrum antibiotic activity both in vitro and in viva. They have good activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms, including many ss lactamase producing strains. The compounds also possess high stability toss lactamases produced by a range of Gram negative and Gram positive organisms. Active compounds according to the invention have been found to exhibit good activity against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis species including penicillinase producing strains of these Gram positive bacteria. This is coupled with good activity against various members of the Enterobacteriaceae e.g. strains of Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and indolepositive Protees organisms such as Protens vulgar is, Proteus morganii and Providence species , and strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus as well as activity against some strains of Pseudomonas species. This combination of high activity against Gram positive organisms with high activity against Gram negative organisms possessed by compounds of the invention is unusual and particularly advantageous. Active compounds of the invention may be used for treating a variety of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria in human beings and animals, such as resporatory tract infections and urinary tract infections. According to another embodiment of the invention we provide a process for the preparation of cephalosporin compounds of general formula I and salts thereof, which comprises A acylating a compound of formula Il EMI11.1 wherein Z, B, the dotted line and R2 are as defined above or a salt including zwitterionic and betaine forms there e.g. an acid addition salt formed with, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric or phosphoric acid or an organic such as methanesulphonic or toluene4 sulphonic acid or a 7 N silyl derivative thereof, with an acid of formula III EMI11.2 wherein R1 and Q are as defined above, and is as defined above for Y other than a carboxyl group or a salt thereof, or with an acylating agent corresponding thereto B where Z in the compound of the invention represents an optionally substituted carbamoyloxy group, reacting a compound of formula Iv EMI12.1 where Q, Y, RÚ, Rê, B and the dotted line are as defined above or a salt thereof, with an acylating agent serving to form the group CH2zb at the 3position wherein zb is a carbamoyloxy group optionay substituted on the nitrogen atom by a C1 4 alkyl ar C1 4 haloalkyl group or an N protected carbamoyloxy group such as a group of formula where R3 is an s protecting group, e.g. a labile group as described above C where Z in the compound of the invention represents an optionally substituted pyridinium or bicyclic pyridinium group or a group of formula SZ whereZ is as defined above 1 reacting a compound of formula V EMI12.2 wherein Q, Y, R1, R2, B and the dotted line are as defined above, and X represents a replaceable residue of a nucleophile e.g. an acetoxy or dichloroacetoxy group or a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or iodine or a salt thereof, with a nucleophile serving to form the desired group of formula CEzZ at the 3 position or D where Z in the compound of the invention represents a group of formula SZ wherein Z contains a c1 4 alkyl substituted or carbamoylmethyl substituted nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring, reacting a compound of formula Ib EMI13.1 wherein Q, Y, RÚ, B and the dotted line are as defined in claim 1 Rê in this instance represents a carboxyl blocking group and Zc represents a carbon linked 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom with a C14 alkylating agent or a carbamoylmethylating agent serving to introduce a C14 alkyl group or a carbamoylmethyl group as a substituent on the nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring of zc. After any of the above processes A to CD any of the following reactions, in any appropriate sequence, may be carried out to give compounds of formula Ia or non toxic salts or non toxic metabolically labile esters thereof i conversion of a t2 isomer into a t3 isomer, ii reduction of a compound wherein B is S O to form a compound wherein B is S , iii conversion of a carboxyl group into a non toxic metabolically labile ester function, iv formation of a non toxic salt, and v conversion of one group Y into another group Y, e.g. amination of a compound in which Y is a carboxyl or esterified carboxyl group to form a compound in which Y is a carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl group, dehydration of a compound in which Y is a carbamoyl group to form a compound in which Y is a cyano group, or esterification of a carboxyl group Y, and vi removal of any carboxyl blocking and or N protecting groups. In the above described process A , the starting material of formula II is preferably a compound wherein B is S and the dotted line represents a ceph 3 em compound. When the group Z in formula II is charged e.g. a pyridinium group or a group of formula a wherein z represents an N alkyl pyridinium group, and no free carboxyl group is present in the molecule, the compound will include an associated anion E such as a halide, e.g. chloride or bromide, or tr i fluoroacetate anion. Acylating agents which may be employed in the preparation of compounds of formula I include acid halides, particularly acid chlorides or bromides. Such acylating agents may be prepared by reacting an acid III or a salt thereof with a halogenating agent e.g. phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Acylations employing acid halides may be effected in aqueous and non aqueous reaction media, conveniently at temperatures of from 50 to 500C, preferably 40 to 300C, if desired in the presence of an acid binding agent. Suitable reaction media include aqueous ketones such as aqueous acetone, aqueous alcohols such as aqueous ethanol, esters such as ethyl acetate, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, amides such as dimethylacetamide, nitriles such as acetonitrile, or mixtures of two or more such solvents.Suitable acid binding agents include tertiary amines e.g. triethylamine or dimettylaniline , inorganic bases e.g. calcium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate , and oxiranes such as lower 1,2 alkylene oxides e.g. ethylene oxide or propylene oxide which bind hydrogen halide liberated in the acylation reaction. Acids of formula III may themselves be used as acylating agents in the preparation of compounds of formula I . Acylations employing acids III are desirably conducted in the presence of a condensing agent, for example a carbodiimide such as N,N dicyclohexylcarboiimide or N eth N gamma dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide a carbonyl compound such as carbonyldiimidazole or an isoxazolium salt such as N ethyl pbenylisoxa olium perchlorate. Acylation may also be effected with other amide forming derivatives of acids of formula III such as, for example, an activated ester, a symmetrical anhydride or a mixed anhydride e.g. formed with pivalic acid or with a haloformate, such as a lower alkylhaloformate . Mixed anhydrides may also be formed with phosphorus acids for example phosphoric or phosphorous acids , sulphuric acid or aliphatic or aromatic sulphonic acids for example toluene4 sulphonic acid . An activated ester may conveniently be formed in situ using, for example, l hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of a condensing agent as set out above. Alternatively, the activated ester may be preformed. Acylation reactions involving the free acids or their above mentioned amide forming derivatives are desirably effected in an anhydrous reaction medium, e.g. methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetonitrile. An alternative method of activation is, for example r by reacting an acid of formula III with a solution or suspension preformed by adding a carbonyl halide, in particular oxalyl chloride or phosgene, or a phosphoryl halide such as phosphorous oxychloride to a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, containing a lower acyl tertiary amide such as N,N dimethylformamide. The activated form of the the acid of formula may then be reacted with a 7 amino compound of formula 11 in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents for example a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane.The acylation react ion may conveniently be effected at temperatures of from 500 to 500C, preferably 400 to 300C, if desired in the presence of an acid binding agent, for example as described above e.g. dimethylaniline . If desired, the above acylation reactions may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The acids of formula III and acylating agents corresponding thereto may, if desired, be prepared and employed in the form of their acid addition salts. Thus, for example, acid chlorides may conveniently be employed as their hydrochloride salts, and acid bromides as their hydrobromide salts. Acetylation of 3 hydroxymethyl compounds of formula IV according to process B may be effected by conventional methods, for example in an analogous manner to that described in British Patent Specification No. 1141293, i.e. by blocking the 4 carboxy group, acetylating the 3 hydroxymethyl group of the protected compound and subsequently removing the blocking group. Carbamoylation of 3 hydroxymethyl compounds of formula IV may be effected by conventional methods using suitable acylating i.e. carbamoylatong agents. Suitable carbamoylating agents include isocyanates of formula R4.NCO wherein R4 is a labile substituent group or the group 0 as defined above , to give a compound containing a 3 position substituent having the formula CH2O.CONHR4 whereinR4 has the above defined meaning .The carbamoylation reaction may desirably be effected in the presence of a solvent or solvent mixture selected from hydrocarbons e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene , balogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane , amides e.g. formamide or dimethylformamide esters eg. ethyl acetate , ethers e.g. cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxan , ketones e.g. acetone , sulphoxides e g. dimethylsulphoxide and mixtures of these solvents. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature of between 80 C and the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, for example up to 100 C, preferably between 20 and 30 C.The labile group R4 may subsequently be cleaved, e.g. by hydrolysis, to form a 3 carbamoyloxymethyl group. Examples of labile groups 0 which are readily cleavable upon subsequent treatment include those labile groups hereinbefore given as examples of the group R3.Such labile groups may generally be cleaved by acid or base catalysed hydrolysis e.g. by base catalysed hydrolysis using sodium bicarbonate ,Halogenated groups such as chlorosulphonyl, dichloro phosphoryl, trichloroacetyl and 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl may also be cleaved reductively, while groups such as chloroacetyl may also be cleaved by treatment with thioamides such as thiourea. The carbamoylating agent is desirably used in excess for example at least 1.1 moles relative to the compound of formula ice . The. carbamoylation may be assisted by the presence of base1 e.g. a tertiary organic base such as a tr i lower alkyl amine e.g. triethylamine or by employing the compound nor in the form of an alkali metal e.g. sodium salt, although such assistance may not be necessary in the case of more active isocyanates, e.g. compounds when R4 is a strongly electron withdrawing group such as chlorosulphonyl or trichloroacetyl.Carbamoylat ions involving reaction of a free acid of formula TV with excess isocyanate wherein R4 is a group such as chlorosulphonyl or trichloroacetyl are thus of particular practical advantage by virtue of the simplicity of the reaction conditions, since there is no need for temporary blocking and subsequent deblocking of the 4 position carboxyl group of the cephalosporin and since the electron withdrawing R4 group in the resulting N protected 3 carbamoyloxymethyl cephalosporin product is readily removed by, for example, hydrolysis with aqueous sodium bicarbonate. It should be noted that it may be convenient to retain or even introduce an N substituting groupR4 during transformations of intermediate 3 carbamoyloxymethyl compounds in order to minimise unwanted side reactions involving the carbamoyloxymethyl group. Another useful carbamoylating agent is cyanic acid, which is conveniently generated in situ1 for example, from an alkali metal cyanate such as sodium cyanate, the reaction being facilitated by the presence of an acid, e.g. a strong organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. Cyanic acid effectively corresponds to the isocyanate compounds mentioned above wherein R4is hydrogen and therefore converts compounds of formula IV directly to their 3 carbamoyloxymethyl analogues. Alternatively, carbamoylation may be effected by reaction of the compound of formula IV with phosgene or carbonyldiimidazole followed by ammonia or the appropriate substituted amine, optionally in an aqueous or non aqueous reaction medium. 3 Hydroxymethyl starting materials of formula CIV are novel compounds and form a further feature of the invention. They may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in British PatentNo. 1474519 and U.S. Patent No. 3976546. Alternatively they may be prepared by N acylating the corresponding 7 amino 3 hydroxymethyl compounds, e.g. analogously to process A above. In process C above, the nucleophile may be used to displace a wide variety of substituentsX from the cephalosporin of formula V . To some extent the facility of the displacement is related to the psa of 5 the acid g from wiiich the substituent is derived. Thus, atoms or groups x derived from strong acids tend, in general, to be more easily displaced than atoms or groups derived from weaker acids, The facility of the displacement is also related, to some extent, to the precise character of the nucleophile. A sulphur nucleophile for introducing the group SZ may be employed for example in the form of an appropriate thiol or thione. The displacement of X by the nucleophile may conveniently be effected by maintaining the reactants in solution or suspension. The reaction is advantageously effected using 1 10 molar equivalents of the nucleophile. Nucleophilic displacement reactions may conveniently be carried out on those compounds of formula V wherein the substituent X is a halogen atom or an acyloxy group, for example as discussed below.Acyloxy groups Compounds of formula V wherein X is an acetoxy group are convenient starting materials for use in the nucleophilic displacement reaction with the nucleophile. Alternative starting materials in this class include compounds of formula V in which x is the residue of a substituted acetic acid e.g. chloroacetic acid, dichioroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. Displacement reactions on compounds v3 possessingX substituents in this class, particularly in the case where x is an acetoxy group, may be facilitated by the presence in the reaction medium of iodide or thiocyanate ions. For example, reactions of this type employing pyridine including bicyclic pyridine nucleophiles are described in more detail in British Patent Specifications Nos 1132621 and 1171603 and British Patent Application 2098268, The substituent X may also be derived from formic acid, a haloformic acid such as chloroformic acid, or a carbamic acid. When using a compound of formula V in whichX represents an acetoxy or substituted acetoxy group, it is generally desirable that the group H in formula V should be a hydrogen atom and that B should represent S . In this case, the reaction is advantageously effected in an aqueous medium. When using a pyridine nucleophile, the aqueous medium is preferably at a pH of 5 to 8, particularly 5.5 to 7. Under aqueous conditions, the pH value of the reaction solution when employing a sulphur nucleophile is advantageously maintained in the range 6 8, if necessary by the addition of a base.The base is conveniently an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or bicarbonate such as sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate. A process employing a pyridine nucleophile and a compound of formula V in which X is the residue of a substituted acetic acid may be carried out as described in British Patent SpecificationNo. 1241657. When using compounds of formula V in whichX is an acetoxy group, the reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature of 100 to 1100C, preferably 200 to 800C. Halogens Compounds of formula tV in which X is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom are novel compounds which form a further feature of the invention and can be conveniently used as starting materials in the nucleophilic displacement reaction with the nucleophile. When using compounds of formula On in this class7 2 may conveniently represent a carboxyl blocking group. When using a sulphur nucleophile, B in the compound of formula V convenient ly represents S , whereas when using a pyridine nucleophile, B is preferably S O.The reaction is conveniently effected in a non aqueous medium which preferably comprises one or more organic solvents advantageously of a polar nature such as ether e.g. dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, esters, e.g. ethyl acetate, amides e.g. formamide andN,N dimethylformamide, and ketones e.g. acetone.In some cases the nucleophile itself may be the solvent. Other suitable organic solvents are described in more detail in British Patent SpecificationNo. 1326531, The reaction medium should be neither extremely acidic nor extremely basic. In the case of reactions carried out on compounds of formula OO in which Rz is a carboxyl blocking group and the resulting Y group contains a quaternary nitrogen atom, the product will be formed as the corresponding halide salt which may, if desired, be subjected to one or more ion exchange reactions to obtain a salt having the desired anion. When using compounds of formula V in whichX is a halogen atom as described above, the reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature of 200 to 600, preferably 00 to 300C. When the incoming nucleophile does not yield a compound containing a quaternised nitrogen atom, the reaction is generally effected in the presence of an acid scavenging agent for example a base such as triethylamine or calcium carbonate. In process D above, the compound of formula Ib is advantageously reacted with a compound of the formula R5W wherein R5 is a C1 4 alkyl group or a group of formula H2NCOCH2 , and W is a leaving group such as a halogen atom e.g. iodine, chlorine or bromine or a hydrocarbylsulphonate e.g. mesylate or tosylate group. Alternatively, a di C14 a1ky1 sulphate, e.g. dimethyl sulphate, may be employed as an alkylating agent. Iodomethane is preferred as the alkylating agent and sodoacetamide is preferred as the carbamoylmethylating agent. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of O to 600C, advantageously 20 to 300C. Where the alkylating agent is liquid under the reaction conditions, as in the case of iodomethaner this agent can itself serve as a solvent. Alternatively, the reaction may be conveniently effected in an inert solvent such as an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran, an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, a lower alkanolf e.g. ethanol, a lower dialkylketone, e.g. acetone, a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichloromethane or an ester e.g. ethyl acetate. The compound of formula Ib used as starting material in process D is a compound according the the present invention and may be prepared for example by reaction of a compound of formula V as defined above with an appropriate sulphur nucleophile in an analogous manner to the nucleophilic displacement reaction described with respect to process C . If desired the above nucleophile may be used in the form of a metal thiolate salt. When X in formula V is halogen, the reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acid scavenging agent, for example a base such as triethylamine or calcium carbonate. The reaction product may be separated from the reaction mixture, which may contain, for example, unchanged cephalosporin starting material and other substances, by a variety of processes including recrystallisation, ionophoresis, column chromatography and use of ion exchangers for example by chromato graphy on ion exchange resins or macroreticular resins. A A2 cephalosporin ester derivative obtained in accordance with the process of the invention may be converted into the corresponding 43 der ivative by, for example, treatment of the A2 ester with a base1 such as pyridine or triethylamine. Where a compound is obtained in which B is SS 0 this may be converted into the corresponding sulphide by, for example, reduction of the correspond ing acyloxysulphonium or alkoxysulphonium salt prepared in situ by reaction with e.g. acetyl chloride in the case of an acetoxysulphonium salt, reduction being effected by, for example, sodium dithionite or by iodide ion as in a solution of potassium iodine in a water miscible solvent e.g. acetic acid, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, dlmethyl formamide or dimethylacetamide. The reaction may be effected at a temperature of from 200 to 500C. Metabolically labile ester derivatives of the compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I or a salt or protected derivative thereof with the appropriate esterifying agent such as an acyloxyalkyl halide or alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl halide e.g. iodide conveniently in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or acetone, followed, where necessary, by removal of any protecting groups. Base salts of the compounds of formula I may be formed by reacting an acid of formula I with an appropriate base. Thus, for example, sodium or potassium salts may be prepared using the respective 2 ethylhexanoate or hydrogen carbonate salt. Acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I or a metabolically labile ester derivative thereof with the appropriate acid. Conversion of a compound in which Y is a carboxyl group into a compound in which Y is an esterified carboxyl group or a carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl group, may conveniently be effect via the formation of an activated intermediate, for example, a mixed anhydride formed with an alkylhalo formate. Such an activated intermediate may conveniently be formed in situ. Amination to form a compound in which V is a carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl group may be effected analogously to the process described in European Patent Application No. 95329. Dehydration of a compound in which Y is a carbamoyl group to form a compound in which V is a cyano group may be effected by conventional methods, e.g. using PC15 or P7o5. Such modifications to the group Y will preferably be carried out using a compound in which R2 represents a carboxyl blocking group Where a compound nf formula I is obtained as a mixture of isomers, the syn isomer may be obtained by, for example, conventional methods such as crystallisation or chromatography. Mixtures of enantiomers, including racemic mixtures, of compounds according to the invention or intermediates therefor may be resolved using conventional means, see for example tStereochemistry of Carbon Compounds by E.L. Elial McGraw Hill, 1962 and Tables of Resolving Agents by S.H. Wilen. For use as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of general formula I according to the invention, compounds of general formula III and the amide forming derivatives thereof such as acid halides and anhydrides corresponding thereto in their syn isomeric form or in the form of mixtures of the syn isomers and the corresponding anti isomers containing at least 90 of the syn isomer are preferably used. Acids of formula III and their derivatives are themselves novel compounds and form a further feature of the invention. They may be prepared by etherification of a compound of formula VI EMI25.1 wherein R1is as hereinbefore defined and R6 represents hydrogen or a carboxyl blocking group or a salt thereof, by selective reaction with a compound of general formula VII T.Q.yb VII wherein Q and Yb are as defined above and T is a halogen atom, such as a chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms a sulphate group or a sulphonate group, such as p toluenesulphonate , followed by removal of any carboxyl blocking group R6 and , if desired, removal of any carboxyl blocking group in Vb. Separation of isomers may be effected either before or after such etherification. The etherification reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate or sodium hydrate, and is preferably conducted in an organic solvent, for example dimetbylsulphoxide, a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, or an N,N disubstitated amide such as dimethylformamide. Under these conditions the configuration of the oxyimino group is substantially unchanged by the etherification reaction. The reaction should be effected in the presence of a base if an acid addition salt of a compound of formula VI is used. The base should be used in sufficient quantity to neutralise rapidly the acid in question. Acids of formula III may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula VIII EMI26.1 wherein RI and R6 are as hereinbefore defined with a compound of formula IX H2N.O.O.Yb IX wherein Q and Vb are as hereinbefore defined followed by removal of any carboxyl blocking group R6 and, if desired, removal of any carboxyl blocking b group in ybv Where necessary the reaction is also followed by the separation of syn and anti isomers. The acids of formula III may be converted into the corresponding acid halides and anhydrides and acid addition salts by conventional methods, for example as described hereinabove. where X is a halogen atom in formula V , ceph 3 em starting compounds may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. by halogenation of a 7ss protected amino 3 methylceph 3 em 4 carboxyl ic acid ester lss oxide, removal of the 7ss protecting group, acylation of the resulting 7ss amino compound to form the desired 7ss acylamido group, e.g. in an analogous manner to process A above, followed by reduction of the 1ss oxide group later in the sequence. This is described in British Patent Specification No. 1326531. The corresponding ceph2 em compounds may be prepared by the method ofDutch published Patent Application No. 6902013 by reaction of a 3 methylceph 2 em compound withN bromosuccinimide to yield the corresponding 3bromomethylceph 2 em compound. Where X in formula V is an acetoxy group, such starting materials may be prepared for example by N acylation of 7 aminocephalosporanic acid, e.g. in an analogous manner to process A above.Compounds of formula V in which X represents other acyloxy groups can be prepared by acylation of the corresponding 3 hydroxymethyl compounds which may be prepared for example by hydrolysis of the appropriate 3 acetoxymethyl compounds, e.g.as described for example in British Patent SpecificationsNos. 1474519 and 1531212. Compounds of formula 11 may also be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. by nucleophilic displacement of a corresponding 3 acyloxymethyl or 3 halomethyl compound with the appropriate nucleophile, e.g. as described in British Patent SpecificationsNos. 1012943 and 1241657, and in British PatentApplications Nos. 202769lA, 2046261A and 209821XA A further method for the preparation of the starting materials of.formula comprises protect ing a corresponding protected 7 3amino compound, for example in conventional manner, e.g. using PCl5. A further reference to the preparation of compounds of formula 11 is U.S. Patent No. 4145538. It should be appreciated that in some of the above transformations it may be necessary to protect any sensitive groups in the molecule of the compound in question to avoid undesirable side reaction. For example, during any of the reaction sequences referred to above it may be necessary to protect the NH2 group of the aminothiazolyl moiety, for example by tritylation, acylation e.g. chloroacetylation or formylation , protonation or other conventional method, so that the protected group is stable to the reaction conditions accompanying one or more synthetic steps. The protecting group may thereafter be removed in any convenient way which does not cause breakdown of the desired compound, e.g. in the case of a trityl group by using an optionally halogenated carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid, formic acid, chloroacetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid or using a mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid or mixtures of such acids, preferably in the presence of a protic solvent such as water, or, in the case of a chioroacetyl group, by treatment with thiourea. carboxyl blocking groups used in the preparation of compounds of formula I or in the preparation of necessary starting materials are desirably groups which may readily be split off at a suitable stage in the reaction sequence, conveniently at the last stage. It may, however, be convenient in some instances to employ non toxic metabolically labile carboxyl blocking groups such as acyloxy methyl or ethyl groups e.g. acetoxy metbyl or ethyl or pivaloyloxymethyl or alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl groups e.g. ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and retain these in the final product to give an appropriate ester derivative of a compound of formula I . Suitable carboxyl blocking groups are well known in the art, a list of representative blocked carboxyl groups being included in British Patent No. 1399086. Preferred blocked carboxyl groups include aryl lower alkoxycarbonyl groups such as methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and diphenylmethoxycarbonyl lower alkoxycarbonyl groups such as t butoxycarbonyl and lower haloalkoxycarbonyl groups such as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl. The carboxyl blocking group may subsequently be removed by any of the appropriate methods disclosed in the literature thus, for example, acid or base catalysed hydrolysis is applicable in many cases, as are enzymically catalysed hydrolyses. It will be appreciated that the use of amino protecting and carboxyl blocking groups is well known in the art and relevant examples of such use are given in e.g. Theodora W. Greene, ProtectiveGroups in Organic Synthesis Wiley Interscience,New York, 1981 , and J.F.W. McOmie, ProtectiveGroups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press, London, 1973 . The antibiotic compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way, by analogy with other antibiotics and the invention therefore includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibiotic compound in accordance with the invention adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be presented for use in conventional manner with the aid of any necessary pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. The antibiotic compounds according to the invention may be formulated for injection and may be presented in unit dose form, in ampoules or in multi dose containers, if necessary with an added preservative. The compositions may also take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents. Alternatively the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen free water, before use. If desired, such powder formulations may contain an appropriate non toxic base in order to improve the water solubility of the active ingredient and or to ensure that when the powder is reconstituted with water, the pH of the resulting aqueous formulation is physiologically acceptable, Alternatively the base may be present in the water with which the powder is reconstituted. The base may be, for example, an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or sodium acetate, or an organic base such as lysine or lysine acetate. The antibiotic compounds may also for example be presented in a form suitable for absorption by the gastro intestinal tract e.g. as tablets or capsules. The antibiotic compounds may also, for example, be formulated as suppositories e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Compositions for veterinary medicine may, for example, be formulated as intramammary preparations in either long acting or quick release bases. The compositions may contain from 0.18 upwards, e.g. 0.1 99 of the active material, depending on the method of administration. When the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain 100 3000 mg e.g. 200 2000 mg of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 200 to 12000 mg e,g, 1000 9000 mg per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. For example, in adult human treatment 400 to 4000 mg per day administered intravenously or intramuscularly will normally suffice. In treating Pseudomonas infections higher daily doses may be required. It will be appreciated that in some circumstances, for example in the treatment of neonates, smaller dosage units and daily dosages may be desirable. The antibiotic compounds according to the invention may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as antibiotics, for example penicillins or other cephalosporins.
