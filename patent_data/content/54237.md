# Displacer rod for use in a mechanical spectral shift nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A displacer rod for use in a mechanical spectral shift pressurized water nuclear reactor comprises a sectioned substantially hollow low neutron absorbing metal rod cap able of displacing reactor coolant without absorbing a high amount of neutrons. The tubular sections 144, 156 prefer ably consist of stainless steel and Zircaloy tubing intercon nected by a solid Zircaloy metal rod 146 and may contain pellets 154 for weighting the displacer rod.
