# HIGH SPEED FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a semiconductor device in which control means for carriers migrating in a first semiconductor 11 includes an interface state layer 12 lying on the first semiconductor 11 and a second conductor layer 13 lying on the interface state layer 12 . The interface state layer 12 has its Fermi level pinned to that of the second semiconduc tor layer 13 . By thus constructing an FET or the semicon ductor device, an inversion or storage layer can be easily formed in the interface merely by applying a voltage to the control means.
