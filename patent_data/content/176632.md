# Method and apparatus for curtain coating.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for curtain coating a flexible web by coating the curtain at a width wider than the width of the web. The margins of the web are preserved from being coated by conveying the web in the coating zone over a web supporting roller than does not support the web margins, and by deflecting the unsupported web margins downwardly by means of curtain interceptors that remain in contact with the web under the elastic recovery forces in the web material.
