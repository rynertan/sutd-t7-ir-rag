# Preparation of salts of hydroxyphosphinylureidobenzylpenicillins.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process in which a 3,5 4,6 protected derivative of L or D glulonic acid is prepared by contacting L or D gulono 1,4 lactone with an aldehyde dialkyl acetal, or with an aldehyde and an alcohol, in the presence of an acid having a pKa of less than 3. This protected derivative may be oxidised and hydrolysed to 2 keto L or D gulonic acid or ester thereof, which in turn may be hydrolysed to L or D ascorbic acid. L ascorbic acid is of course Vitamin C. The invention also relates to the novel intermediates produced by the above processes.
