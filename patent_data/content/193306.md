# SOLID STATE MEMORY CARTRIDGE

## Abstract
A portable memory cartridge 10 is provided with a plurality of memory storage devices 11 16 51 56 along with a decoder 30 that permits an external device D1 D8 to address specific memory locations within the memory cartridge devices or individual capacities of the memory devices used within the memory cartridge. A connector 22 is connected in signal communication with each of the memory devices within the memory cartridge and a decoder 30 is used to determine the proper memory component applicable for a particular address received from an external device. The connection points C1 C32 of the connector are divided into three sets. A first set C1 C8 represents binary digits of data. A second set C11 C21 C11 C23 represents the lower order bits of an address word and the third set C22 C24 C24 C26 represents the higher order bits of an address word which is used as an input to the decoder 30 which selects one of the plurality of memory devices in which the chosen memory location is located. The combined third and second binary digits represents a total address relative to the 0 location within the entire memory cartridge. The circuitry and memory devices are located within a plastic case that is made of an antistatic material to pre vent inadvertent damage during insertion into an external device.
