# Liquid, thickened chlorine bleaching composition.

## Abstract
In liquid, pourable, thickened chlorine bleaching com positions, in which the thickening is produced by at least two different detergent active compounds, a buffer salt is included to improve their stability at lower chlorine levels and at reduced pH values. Typically, a composition com prises an aqueous solution of alkalimetal hypochlorite, thickened by means of a tertiary amine oxide and a satu rated fatty acid soap, and contains an alkali metal ortho phosphate buffer system, at a chlorine content of 1 10 and a pH of 10 12.5. The compositions are useful in bleaching operations, especially in bleaching hard surfaces such as toilets, tiles, kitchen sinks etc.
