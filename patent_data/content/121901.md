## Description
STATE OF THE ARTU.S. Patent No. 3,031,450 describes 2,6 bis diethanol amino 4,8 dipiperidino pyrimido i5,4 d3 pyrimidine or dipyridamole as a coronary vasodilator and it has been used in various pharmaceutical forms for many years. However, dipyrimidole is readily water soluble only in an acidic medium, and therefore it can only go into solution from scklid pharmaceutical forms end then o bed if the pharmaceutical preparations remain in the acidic range for a sufficiently long period. Thus, the solubility and hence also the absorption greatly depend upon the retention time and the pH value in the stomach and upper intestinal tract.This results in sharp inter individual and intraindividual fluctuations in the blood levels see Table 3 below since the mobility of a patient, the pH of the patient s stomach and intestines, and the patient s food intake have a considerable influence on absorption. In some patients, the blood levels may even be so low that they practically amount to an absence of absorption.One attempt to solve these problems is described in U.S.Patent No. 4,361,546 wherein a core of dipyridamole and at least one mole of an acid substance per mole of dipyridamole is coated with a semi permeable d wfusior. coating of a water insoluble eilm former and a water soluble polymer and optionally an acid insoluble polymer.Copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 389,282 filedJune 17, 1982 describes dipyridamole compositions containing at least 5 equivalents of an acid or acid substance per mole of dipyridamole to obtain a high degree of relative bioavailability.U.S. Patent No. 4,367,217 describes spheroid particles of dipyridamole and at least one acid equivalent of an acid or acid substance per mole of dipyridamole coated with a dialysis membrane of acid insoluble lacquers soluble in intestinal juices and coated particles in a capsule. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONIt is an obJect of the invention to provide novel pH independent, controlled release oral tablets comprising an effective amount of an intimate mizture of dipyridamole or an acid addition salt thereof, at least 8 acid equivalents of at least one non toxic, pharmaceutically acid or acid substance per mole of dipyridamole and a sufficient amount of a disintegration agent to allow at least 90 96 dissolution of dipyridamole in the gastrointestinal pH range of 1 to 7.It is another obJect of the invention to provide an improved method of inducing coronary vasolidatory activity in warmblooded animals.These and other obJects and advantages of the invention will become obvious from the following detailed description. THE INVENTIONThe novel compositions of the invention are pH independent, controlled release oral tablets comprising an effective amount of an intimate mixture of dipyridamole or an acid addition salt thereof, at least 18 acid equivalents of at least one non toxic, pharmaceutically acid or acid substance per mole of dipyridamole and a sufficient amount of a disintegration agent to allow at least 90 dissolution of dipyridamole in the gastrointestinal pH range of 1 to 7.Examples of non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acids for the acid addition salts of dipyridamole are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, etc..Examples of suitable solid acids for the compositions of the invention are non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as aric acid, maleic acid, tartrc a citric acid, succinic acid, ascorbic acid and mixtures thereof and acid salts such as sodium bisulfate, potassium bisulfate, betaine hydrochloride, monosodium and monopotassium salts of tartaric acid or citric acid and mixtures thereof.Examples of suitable disintegration agents are sodium starch glycolate sold under the name Primojel, crospovidone sold under the name Polyplasdone XL and croscarmelose sold under the name AC DI SOL. The amount of disintegrating agent will vary depending upon the specific agent selected but has to be sufficient to maintain continuously a highly localized acidic pH around the tablet to ensure sufficient release of dipyridamole regardless of the pH of the gastrointestinal environment but low enough so the tablet does. not rapidly disintegrate into small particles which become rapidly neutralized rendering the dipyridamole insoluble.The amount of sodium starch glycolate meeting these requirements has been found to be about 5 to 10 , preferably about 7.5 by weight of the tablet. With lower amounts such as 2 by weight, the tablet does not release an adequate amount of dipyridamole because the tablet does not disintegrate sufficiently to expose dipyridamole to the gastrointestinal tracts. With higher amounts on the order of 17.2 by weight, the tablet rapidly disintegrates into small particles and the localized acid pH around dipyridamole is lost whereby dipyridamole becomes insoluble in the gastrointestinal tracts.Tests have shown that crospovidone may be used in a weight ratio of 10 to 12 96 and that croscarmelose may be used in an amount of 3 to 5 46 by weight of the tablet. The critical feature is that the tablet should disintegrate at a controlled rote so that at least 90 of the dipyr 4Aeinole jn the tablet will be dissolved and available for absorption by the gastrointestinal tracts of the warm blooded animals both in the stomach and the intestine. In other words, the differing pH values of the stomach and intestinal tract will not effect the ability of dipyridamole to continuously dissolve.The quantity of acid present in relation to the dipyridamole has no upper limit per se it is only limited by the fact that if the quantity of acid present is too great, it is not possible to produce an oral form of dipyridamole which can be easily swallowed. A ratio of at least 18 acid equivalents of acid present to 1 mol of dipyridamole is preferred. Fumaric acid has proven to be a particularly suitable acid.It is physiologically non toxic, and easy to compress, and when combined with dipyridamole, it does not produce a hydroscopic mixture. Lts low solubility is essential to the invention this ensures that, in the gastrointestinal tract the dipyridamol e c ontaining particle is always surrounded by a sufficiently acidic microsphere in which the dipyridamole, which does not dissolve radily, is dissolved safely and completely.In addition to the conventional excipients used, namely, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydrogenated castor oil, and polyacrylic acid, it is also possible to use excipients such as methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, Furthermore, to achieve the desired release, mixtures consisting of dipyridamole and acidic substances may be granulated with fats dissolved in organic solvents or with lacquers resistant to gastric Juices and then compressed into tablets. Tho 4t 7Ci nCg f the invention for induci ccr3fl y vasolidatory activity in warm blooded animals, including humans, comprising orally administering to warm blooded animals a pH independent, controlled release oral tablet comprising an effective amount of an intimate mixture of dipyridamole or an acid addition salt thereof, at least 18 acid equivalents of at least one non toxic, pharmaceutically acid or acid substance per mole of dipyridamole and a sufficient amount of a disintegration agent to allow at least 90 dissolution of dipyridamole in the gastrointestinal pH range of 1 to 7. The usual daily dosage is 1 to 3 mg kg.In the following examples there are described several preferred embodiments to illustrate the invention. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments. EXAMPLE 1A mixture of 0.3 kg of dipyridamole, 0.63 kg of fumaric acid mass ratio of 1 2.1 , 0.0702 kg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.3738 kg of lactose and 0.108 kg of sodium starch glycolate 7.2 by weight of the total composition was wet granulated in admixture with isopropanol. The wet granulated was screened through an 18 mesh sieve and was dried at about 400C. The dried granulate, 0.012 kg of magnesium stearate and 0.006 kg of colloidal fumed silicon dioxide were blended in a mixer and the mixture was compressed into 50 mg tablets in a tabletting machine.Using the USP XX paddle test method operating at 50 rpm at 370C, the tablets showd a 100 dissolution in less than one hour at pH levels of 1.2 O.LN HCl 4.0 Modified Walpole Acetate Buffer , 6.o McIlvaineBuffer and water as can be seen from Fig. 1. The 100 dis solution is due to the fact that the proper mass ratio of dipyr4damole to acid 1 2.1 and the proper amount of sodium starch glycolate 7.25 w w provide and maintain high microenvironmental acidic pH around the tablet until dipyridamole is released sufficiently. EXAMPLE 2A mt of 1.20 kg of dipyridamole, 2.52 kg of fumaric acid 1 2.1 by mass , 0.216 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.466 kg of lactose and 0.360 kg of sodium starch glycolate 7.5 by weightof the total composition was wet granulated with 95 ethanol and the wet granulate was milled in an oscillator and dried at 400C. The dried granulate and 0.0384 kg of magnesium stearate were milled and blended and the mixture was compressed into 50 mg tablets.As can be seew from Fig. 2, the tablets showed 100 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6 due to the fact that the proper mass ratio of dipyridamole to fumaric acid 1 2.1 and the proper amount of sodium starch glycolate 7.55 w w provide controlled disintegration and sufficient dissolution of dipyridamole. EXAMPLE 3Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 2.4 kg of dipyridamols,1.790kg fumaric acid 1 0,75 by mass , 0.226 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.346 kg of sodium starch glycolate 7.2 by weight of total composition and 0.038 kg of magnesium stearate was formed into 50 mg tablets which showed only a 3 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6.0 as seen from Fig. 3 due to the fact that there is an insufficient quantity of acid available thus not providing a low enough microenvironmental ac dic pH. EXAMPLE 4Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 1.2 kg of dipyridamole, 2.04 kg of fumaric acid 1 1.7 by mass , 0.168 kg of po1yvinylpyrroldon, 0.994 kg of 1ctose, 0.360 kg of sodium starch glycolate 7.596 by weight of the total composition and 0.038 kg of magnesium stearate was formulated into 50 mg tablets which as can be seen fromFig. 4 showed approximately 70 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6.0 due to insufficient acid available thus providing too high a localized pH. EXAMPLE 5Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 0.6 kg of dipyridamole, 1.26 kg of furmaric acid 1 2.1 by mass 0.1404 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.9036 kg of lactose, 0.06 kg of sodium starch glycolate 2 by weight of total composition and 0.024 kg of magnesium stearate was formed into 50 mg tablets which can be seen from Fig. 5 showed approximately 80 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6.0 due to prolonged disintegration time. EXAMPLE 6Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 1.0 kg of dipyridamole, 2.1 kg of fumaric acid 1 2.1 by mass , 0.18 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.688 kg 17.2 by weight of sodium starch glycolate and 0.032 kg of magnesium stearate was formulated into 50 mg tablets which as can be seen from Fig. 6 showed approximately 86 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6 due to the fact that the tablet dis integrated too rapidly. EXAMPLE 7Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 0.167 kg of dipyridamole 0.350 kg of fumaric acid 1 2.1 by mass , 0.030 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.065 kg of lactose, 0.050 kg of crospovidone 7 5N by weight of the total composition and 0.005 kg of magnesium stearate was formulated into 50 mg which as can be seen from Fig. 7 showed a 40 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6.0 due to the fact that the tablet disintegrated too rapidly. EXAMPLE 8Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 0.625 kg of dipyridamole, 1.313 kg of fumaric acid 1 2.1 by nass , 0.113 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.430 kg of crospovidone 17.2 by weight of the total composition and 0.02 kg of magnesium stearate was formulated into 50 mg tablets which as Fig. 8 sllustrates showed a 80 dissolution in one hour at a pEI of 6.0 due to the fact that the tablet disintegrated too rapidly. EXEMPLE 9Using the procedure of Example 2, a mixture of 0.75 kg of dipyridamole, 1.575 kg of fumaric acid 1 2.1 by mass , 0.135 kg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.291 kg of lactose, 0.225 kg of croscarmelose 7.5 by weight of the total composition and 0.024 kg of magnesium stearate was formulated into 50 mg tablets which as seen from Fig. 9 showed a 75 dissolution in one hour at a pH of 6.0 due to the fact that the tablet disintegrated too rapidly.Various modifications of the tablets and method of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit or scope thereof and it is to be understood that the invention is intended to be limited only as defined in the appended claims.
