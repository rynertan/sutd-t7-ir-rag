# U.V. curable coating composition and a process for coating a substrate with such coating composition.

## Abstract
A coating composition is disclosed which is curable under the influence of ultraviolet light and which comprises a U.V. curable binder, a photoinitiator and as accelerator an N,N disubstituted cyclic 1,3 diaza compound having 5 to 9 ring atoms. The accelerator is preferably an N,N disubstituted imidazolidine or hexahydropyrimidine com pound. The U.V. curable binder is preferably an unsaturated epoxy resin or an at least one isocyanate group containing adduct of a an acrylic or methacrylic hydroxyester having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, and b a polyisocyanate having 5 to 44 carbon atoms and 2 to 4 isocyanate groups.
