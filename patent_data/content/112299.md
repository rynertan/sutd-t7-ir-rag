## Description
METEO O SUPEROXIDIC DISMUTASIS PURIFICATION VI C O ATO PAPI A I IT This invention refers to a method for purifying superoxidic dismutasis. More specifically, this invention refers to a method for obtaining purified superoxidic dismutasis from animal tissues in particular from. the hepatic tissue or erythrocytes of the superior animals, as the Mammalia, Primates excepted through chromatography by affinity on an irnrriunoabsorbent with specific antibodies for the enzyme It is well known from prior art that several organs or tissues of living organisms contain an enzyme which catalyzes the dismutation reaction of the anion supercxide, which is one. of the products which develop physioloqically from the reduction of oxygen.This enzyme, found in superior animals, contains copper, an element which is essential for the catalytic activity.In view of the beneficial effects that the administration of superoxidic dismutusis causes in nen and animals in some pathological conditions, it is obvious that the problem of purification and isolation of this enzyme has gained increasing importance.As it is well known, superoxidic diemutasis can be found mainly in the liver and in the blood of superior animals, but in rather small amounts, i.e. in the order of 0.05 0.1 orams per kilo of fresh tissue.So far several methods have been proposed for the purification of superoxidic dismutasis from heptatic tissue and erythrocytes.These methods are generally based on the preferential removal of foreign protein obtained through a treatnent with organic solvents or proteolytic enzymes or acidic buffers. The superoxidic dismutasis is then purified by using conventional methods for the purification of enzymes.However, these techniques are not free from drawbacks which concern both the number and the complexity of operations needed as well as their high cost. Therefore, the purpose of this invention is to provide E method for the purification of superoxididismutasis free from the above raentioned practical and economical drawbacks.To this end, the method which is disclosed in this invention, is based on a selective interaction between the specific antibody, immunized suitably, and the enzyme which is present in the organ extract.It was found out in fact that the interaction between, superoxidic dismutasis and specific antibodies, suitably selected and covalently boUnd cn an insoluble matrix can he used for removing the tissue components which are foreign to the enzyme with a single operation. The enzyme can then be extracted without being damaged with the usual conventional tecniques. Thus the process for purifying superoxidic dismutasis accordinding to this invention turns out to be more advantageous than other well known processes thanks to its semplicity.Therefore, the specific object o this invention is to provide a method for the purification of superoxidic dismutasis from animal tissues and is characterized by the use of specific antibodies for the enzyme.This invention will be thereinafter described in detail in the following example.ExampleThis example concerns thc purification of superoxidic dismutasis, which is obtained from cattle erythrocytes. The preparation described is referred to one liter of cattle erythrocytes as starting material.First cf all has to be prepared the antiserum antisuperoxidic dismutasis. For such a purpose rabbits are usec, each of which is immunized through the following procedure a a first inoculation of a mixture 1 1 of antigen solution 1 mg ml and a complete Freund adjuvant is carried out I ml of ilis mixture is inoculated into the paw pads of the hind legs of each rabbit b after 30 days a second inoculation is carried out wTith the same antigenic mixture in an incomplete Freund adjuvant and in the sane way as thc first one . 15 days after the second inoculation has been carried out, the rabbite are killed and the serur is collected.The apecific anti bodies are the purified by means of a chromatography by affinity, according to the following procedure a superoxidic dismutasis is made insoluble on an inert matrix The matrix, which in this case, consi ts of Sepharose 4 Trade Mark resin produced byPharmacia, is washed three times in a solution of sodium chloride 0.15 M buffered at pH 7.2 with phosphate 15 mM from now on called BS . The resin is then resuspended at 50 in water and CNBr dissolved in water is added to it under agitation, keeping the pH constant at 31, by adding NaOH 1N. After about 10 minutes the resin is washed with cold distilled water and sodium bicarbonate 0.1 M, pH 8.6 and filtered through a paper filter, which is placed in a china funnel. The matrix is then brought into contact with an equal volume of solution of superoxidic dismutasis at a concentration of 3 mg ml in sodium bicarbonate 0.1 M, pE e.6 and is left to react for 24 hours at 4 C, under agitation. Washing is then carried out by using sodium bicarbonate 0.1M, pE 8.6, acetic aci 0.1M and PFS. Two volumes of MgCl2 3.5 r are then passed through in order to remove the residual protein which is non convalently bound. Under these conditions 50 , of the enzyme binds itself to the fixed phase b the specific antibodies are isolated by mixing the rabbit s serum with the immunoabsorbent under saturant conditions. After being washed in PBS, and until absorption at 280 nm becomes negligible, the specific antibodies are deluted with Cl2 3.5 and then dialyzed against water, concentrated under vacuum and dialyzed against PRS. The yield is of about 1.5 mg of specific antibody per ml of serum. It should be taken into consideration that by means of this method, an immunabsorbent can be used several times 50 without any important loss of efficiency.Thus the purification of the superoxidic dismutasis purification takes place. The first step ie thc preparation of the antisuperoxidic dismutasis antibodies which are made insoluble or inert ratrix. To this en, the specific antibodies are conjugated covalently on an inert matrixin this case, Sepharose 4 Trade Mark by Pharmacia, activated with CNBr and, as a consequence, about 90 of the antibodies will be. covalently bound by the fixed phase. Then the hemolysis product is prepared. For this purpose, one liter of cattle erythrocytes, washed with a 0.15 M solution of sodium chloride, in subjected to hemolysis with one liter of distilled water and left under cold agitation for 1 hour. Finally, the enzyme is purified with two litere of the hemolysis product passing on every 300 ml of immunoabsorbent which has been activated with specific anti superoxidic aismutasiE antibodies. The column is washed with PBS.Then, PRE added to sodium chloride 0.6 M is passed through and MgCl2 3.5 M is used to delute thi latter.After dialysis against water the enzyme is concentrated with the solution passing cn an anionic oxchange resin. column, in this case AL Sephadex Trade Mark byPharmacia buffered at pH 7.0 using a 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer. The dilution is then carried out with the same buffer 80 mM. 90 mg of superoxidic dismutasis per 300 ml of immunoabsorbent are diluted on average. The superoxidic dismutasis obtained in thie way ifi desalinized and dehydrated. The paramagnetic resonance spectre PPB of the enzyme obtained in this way show the native protein well known characteristics and the absence of any other paramagnetic species. The ultraviolet spectra, the electrophoresis in polyacrylamide and the specific activity of the enzyme show the absence of any contamination.then hepatic tissue is used, this latter is finely sliced and homogenized by a mixing operation with an addition of a physiological solution.The product of the invention can be used for phamaceutical or industrial purposes.
