# ELECTROSENSITIVE TRANSFER FILM

## Abstract
An electric discharge transfer film material comprising at least two layers, the first of which is a an electrically anisotropic support layer 2 having electroconductive parti cles dispersed in a resin matrix. The electroconductive particles can be graphite particles having a particle size between 0.1 to 20 microns, carbon black particles having a particle size between 25 to 500 millimicrons, or metal powders, and b at least one thermal or electrothermal transfer layer 4 in the form of a resin layer capable of being broken by electrical discharge and transferred to a record sheet, e.g., paper.
