# NPN lateral transistor isolated from a substrate by orientation dependent etching, and method of making it.

## Abstract
The invention provides a unique sub micron dimen sioned NPN type transistor and method of making the same, wherein hundreds of such transistors may be fabricated on a single chip with each transistor comprising an active region surrounded by field oxide completely isolating it from the substrate and its effects on operation. Spaced apart slots made in the substrate permit the introduction of orientation dependent etching fluid therein to at least substantially etch semi arrays of active regions of the substrate away from the substrate except for spaced apart supports therealong. Oxidation serves to support the semi arrays and subsequent steps directly from the substrate or by webs of oxidation along the tops of the semiarrays connected to the substrate. The support is necessary while orthogonal slots are provided permitting access to opposed sides of the active regions for doping n from each end, which n is driven in from both sides to provide an n p n emitter base collector transistor active region to which electrical connections are applied using conventional techniques providing almost complete reduction of the parasitic capacitances and resistances because of the total oxide isolation of the active regions from the substrate.

## Description
Field of the Invention This invention is a novel structure and method for forming a sub micron NPN type lateral dielectrically isolated transistor utilizing VLSI chip processing steps to fabricate hundreds of such devices simultaneously.Background of the Invention Techniques extracted from the prior art come from the field of sub micron fabrication technology wherein the dimensional resolution is now comparable to or even smaller than the thicknesses of the thermally grown silicon oxide layers on silicon. Also, the dimensions are now comparable or even smaller than the base widths used for double diffused transistors, i.e. 0.4 to 1.0 micrometers.From these techniques, the novel structure and method for the NPN lateral transistor with greatly reduced parasitic capacitance and resistances is achieved.Summary of the Invention The invention is a novel lateral NPN type transistor formed on a substrate by orthogonal slots which define each active region and permit undercutting of the active regions via a first pair of opposed slots, followed by oxidation for support of the spaced apart semiarrays of transistor active regions formed by the first pair of slots, while N doping is introduced through the second pair of opposed slots and driven in to comprise an N P N active region totally isolated from the substrate by substrate oxidation. Electrical connections are made in conventional fashion to the N emitter, P base and N collector.

Brief Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention In the device produced in accordance with the present invention, the effects of the substrate are minimized relative to the operation of the device. It should be realized that the active region may be 2 completely contained with the surface area of 3d x 5d or 15d wherein d is only 0.4 micrometers. The isolated region is completely separated from the substrate by oxidation and the parasitic capacitances and resistances are almost completely reduced to a minimum value attainable because the transistor is reduced essentially to just its electronically active region. Whereas in the conventional vertical transistor, the electrically active region is only a very small fraction of the total transistor area.The dielectric isolation between transistors offered by the same substrate oxidation has advantages with respect to high frequency performance, high voltage integrated circuits, radiation resistance, and circuit flexibility, i.e. the process can provide NPN, PNP, JFET, MOSFET, etc. on the same integrated circuit chip. Reference now to Figure 1 shows a silicon substrate 21 of theP type, patterned by photoresist 23 to leave exposed the regions 25 and 26 which will be subsequently slotted. It should be noted that the upper surface 27 of substrate 21 is a 100 surface useful in orientation dependent etching. In the sectional view of Fig. 2, slots 31 and 32 have been formed into substrate 21 through upper surface 27 in the unprotected regions 25 and 26. Slotting may be achieved by ion milling or etching and thus removes the unprotected portions of the substrate oxide layer 22. In Fig. 3 there is shown the substrate 21 after orientation dependent etching fluid is introduced through slots 31 and 32 to attack the substrate, oxide layer 22 remaining after the resist 23 has been removed protects the upper surface of the triangular semiarrays 36 from attack by the fluid. The orientation dependent etching fluid removes the regions 35 from the substrate 21, which regions are bounded by planes 111 37. It may seen that the semi arrays 36 are separated from the substrate 21, however, at spaced apart positions along the semiarray regions 36 spaced apart supports of silicon are left to prevent the semi arrays 36 from collapsing into the voids 35. These spaced apart supports may be protected from oxidation by spaced apart stripes of material immune to the etch placed along the slots 31 and 32. Alternatively the semi array regions 36 may need be only supported at their ends which can be accomplished by leaving a boundary region of oxide 22 on the surface 100 shown at 27. Figure 4 shows an alternative step to that described in Fig. 3 wherein the etching is stopped earlier so that the arrays 36 are still supported from the silicon substrate by narrow connections or webs 41. Following the etching steps of Figs. 3 or 4, the resist 23 is removed in conventional fashion. In Fig. 5, the structure of Fig. 3 is shown following oxidation of the substrate 21. It may be seen that the oxide grows inwardly of the semi array region 36 as shown at 51 and outwardly thereof as shown at 53. Thus, the intersection 55 shows a solid oxide support for the region 37 which will enable subseuqent steps to be performed. However, this oxide support is not necessary in view of the Fig.6 arrangement wherein the oxide coating 63 and 67 do not come together to support region 36 , but the upper oxide 71 extends webs 73 between the regions 36 to maintain a top support for all semi array regions 36 . The succeeding step wherein support is required is shown inFig. 7. Orthogonal slots 81 and 83 together with slots 45 and 47 form a mote around each active region 36. Also, from Fig. 7 it may be seen that slots 45 and 47 were filled with oxide except where slots 81 and 83 cut through the oxide. Obviously, slots 81 and 83 are not filled with oxide and they are next used for the doping step to follow. In Fig. 8 it may be seen that P ions phosphorous are implanted into the edges of slots 81 and 83 as indicated by the lines 85. This ion implant forms the N doping, as by heat, to The next step is to drive in the N doping, as by heat, to forsn the expanded N regions shown in Fig. 9 at 85 and 86 . The region 85 serves as the emitter, the region 21 original substrate 21 serves as the base and the region 86 is the collector. The next step is to oxidize the entire structure such that the periphery of the active region 121 is entirely oxidized by the silicon oxide 91. This is what separates the active region 121 from the original substrate 21 for complete electrical isolation. In Fig. 11 the active region is seen per se with a width dimension of 3d and a length dimension of 5d. Electrical connections are made to the emitter, base and collector regions 85 , 21 , 86 by conventional means of metallization which overlays the metal connection 101 to the emitter 85 , 102 to the base 21 and 103 to the collector 86 . While modifications of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art, it is intended that the scope of the invention be defined in the appended claims wherein
