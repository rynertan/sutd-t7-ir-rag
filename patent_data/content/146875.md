# X RAY GENERATOR WITH VOLTAGE FEEDBACK CONTROL

## Abstract
A high frequency transistor inverter operates from a fixed d.c. source to feed a high voltage transformer whose output is filtered and rectified for application to an X ray tube. The output voltage at the tube is sensed and a voltage feedback signal is compared with a voltage demand signal to obtain a voltage error signal which is applied to a control network for the inverter. The controller responds to the voltage error signal and to various protective and synchro nizing signals to control the individual transistors of the inverter, in a pulse width modulated mode, to obtain a desired voltage output to the tube.
