# Cavitating jet device.

## Abstract
A device for applying cavitating liquid jets to a work surface has an annular work surface engaging area sur rounding a chamber 4 , recessed into the device and with an open end adjacent the working surface, a jet nozzle 14 on the opposite side of the chamber 4 which projects a high velocity liquid jet against the working surface, and passages extending from the chamber 4 to the interior of the tool and providing the main route for escape of spent liquid, the passages being calibrated so as to maintain the chamber full of liquid without engendering a substantial pressure rise within the chamber. The velocity of the liquid jet is high enough that shear between the jet and the spent liquid causes cavitation.
