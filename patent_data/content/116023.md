# Arrangement for deflecting powder gases from an aircraft weapon.

## Abstract
An arrangement for deflecting powder gases from an aircraft weapon 12 , particularly an automatic cannon, com prises a mouthpiece 29 mounted in front of the barrel muzzle which initially deflects the powder gases in a direc tion obliquely forward outward, and a set of guide plates 30 which are arranged one behind the other in the gas stream from the mouthpiece and which give rise to a further deflec tion of the powder gases, so that they are caused to be dis charged in a direction outward from the aircraft structure.
