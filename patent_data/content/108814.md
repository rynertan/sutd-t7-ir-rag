# CHARGE TRANSFER DEVICE FOR PROCESSING COLOR SIGNAL.

## Abstract
This charge transfer device synthesizes color signals and in particular enables the synthesis of signals even when the output circuit and level regulating circuit necessary for the synthesis of color signals are omitted. The configuration from a color signal synchronizing circuit to a predetermined color difference signal forming circuit is formed integrally on a chip. For the purpose, in a charge transfer device for processing color signals, first, second and third color sig nals are synthesized sequentially into a signal charge state in each predetermined period to form first and second syn thesized signals. On the other hand, after the signals before the synthesis have been delayed for a predetermined period of time, the signals are synthesized in the same way into a signal charge state to form first and second synthesized signals. These synthesized signals are supplied to a switch ing processor 25 of the charge transfer type having 2 input terminals and 2 output terminals, which switches them in each predetermined period, to isolate and output the first synthesized signal from one output terminal 40 and the second synthesized signal from the other output terminal 41 . This device is preferably used as a color signal processor of a color solid state image pickup element using a charge transfer element such as a CCD as an image pickup element.
