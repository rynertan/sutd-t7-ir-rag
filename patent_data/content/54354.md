# Membrane comprising an intimate blend of polymers.

## Abstract
A membrane which comprises an intimate blend of a water insoluble matrix polymer and a water insoluble copolymer compatible with the matrix polymer, which copolymer is prepared by copolymerization of a first monomer which, when homopolymerized, would result in a compatible homopolymer with the matrix polymer, and a second monomer which, when homopolymerized, would result in an incompatible homopolymer with the matrix polymer, one or both of the monomers containing positive or negative functional groups, to provide a blended, compatible, water insoluble membrane for use in reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration processes.
