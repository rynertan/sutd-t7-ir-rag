# Method and tool for individual pin exchange in a dense array of connector pins of an electronic packaging structure.

## Abstract
The disclosure is directed to a method and a tool for the replacement of any single connector pin 1 contained within a sizeable array of closely spaced very small connector pins on an electronic packaging structure 2 substrate or mod ule without causing deleterious effects either to the remain ing pins 1 or the substrate, which may be ceramic. A pin gripper mechanism 10,11,12 is accurately posi tioned over the connector pin 1 to be replaced, the pin 1 is grasped with a pulling force 16 being applied. A stream of heated gas 8 is directed by a nozzle 7 onto the lower portion of the connector pin 1 which can be removed when the temperature reaches the reflow temperature of the alloy at the brazing joint. A replacement pin 1 is then inserted under pressure, with the heated gas 6,8 brazing the pin 1 in position.
