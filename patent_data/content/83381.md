# Electrical conduit or mechanical pipe spacemaker protection cap device for use within concrete walls during concrete forming process.

## Abstract
A tool for use in the construction industry to form a space around conduits or pipes routed through concrete or other material structures. This tool is primarily conical in shape A and formed to accept different sized conduits or pipes B into the small er end with the larger planar end being located onto shut ters C used when forming concrete structures. The tool is temporarily locked in postion using a screw D and on removing both screw and shutter, the tool can be removed affording an access space for continuing the conduit or pipe route and also cable pulling. The tool is useable where adaptors are separately employed. Alternative rectangular or square Box Like devices F can be used there it is required to afford like location, protection and extension of conduits or pipes and also afford access for cable pulling and for connection of conduit and cables to either recessed or surfaced mounted proprietary electrical units.

## Claims
WHAT I CLAIM IS 1. A DEVICE CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO FORM A SPACE WITHIN WALLS,SLABS OR STRUCTURES UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND AROUND CONDUITOR PIPE ROUTED WITHIN SUCH STRUCTURES AND REQUIRED TO TER LI MINATE EITHER PEMIANENTLY OR TEMPORARILY AbJACE,,,,T TOSHUTTER OR FORMWORK. 2. A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN CLAIM NO. 1 WHICH PROTECTS TilECONDUIT OR PIPE FROM PHYSICAL DAMAGE ON REMOVAL OF THESHUTTER OR FORMWORK AND PRECLUDES THE NEED FOR THE CONDUITOR PIPE TO PENETRATE THE SHUTTER. 3. I CLAIM A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN ANY PRECEDING CLAIM WHICHPROVIDES CORRECT POSITIONING OF THE PIPE OR CONDUIT ANDSECURING OF SAME DURING CONSTRUCTION OF STRUCTURES. 4. I CLAIM A DEVICE AS HEREINBEFORE DESCRIBED WITH REFER ENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.

## Description
I, MARK BENSON A BRITISH SUBJECT OF OLDE PAGES COTTAGEMAIN STREET MAIDS MORETON BUCKS DO HEREBY DECLARE THEINVENTION FOR WHICH I PRAY THAT A PATENT MAY BE GRANTEDME AND THE METHOD BY WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED TO BEPARTICULARLY DESCRIBED IN AND BY THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT.THE OBJECT OF THE INVENTION IS TO PROVIDE MEANS AND METHODSOF FORMING BOTH PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY SPACE AND ALSO TEMt PORARY PROTECTION OF ELECTRICAL CONDUIT AND MECHANICAL PIPEREQUIRED TO BE ROUTED AND TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLYTERMINATED WITHIN WALLS OR SLABS FORMED FROM SUCH MATERIALAS CONCRETE.THE PRESENT INVENTION IS CONCERNED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OFA PLASTIC OR OTHER MATERIAL SPACEMAKER DEVICE A WHICH ISSO SHAPED AS TO AFFORD EASE AND STRENGTH OF MANUFACTUREMINIMUM USE OF SPACE WITHIN A WALL OR SLAB AND PROVIDESRELATIVE EASE OF REMOVAL AFTER INSTALLATION WHERE IT ISINTENDED TO FURTHER EXTEND THE CONDUIT OR PIPE WHICH ROUTESWITHIN THE INGOING SECTIONS OF SLAB OR WALL BEING FORMED ONSITE OR IN A FACTORY.WHILST THE ABOVEMENTIONED DEVICE AND INVENTION EMBODIES THEPRINCIPLE CONCEPT AND IS OUTLINED IN SOME DETAIL ON THEENCLOSED DRAWINGS NAMELY FIGURE NUMBERS 1 AND 2 IT SHOULD BENOTED THAT ITS APPLICATION IS OF USE WHERE SUCH SPECIFICMATERIALS AS BRITISH, AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN STANDARD PROPRIETARY CONDUIT, PIPE AND RELATED COUPLING JOINT CONNECTIONS ARE EMPLOYED WITHIN THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ALLIEDINDUSTRIES.WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO FIGURES 1 AND 2 ThEIR SIMILARITY IS THE USE OF THE SPACEMAKER DEVICE A , CONICAL INFORM, WHICH HAS ONE END FITTED TO A CONDUIT B FORMING ACAP AND THEREBY PROTECTING THE CONDUIT FROM INGRESS OF SUCHMATERIAL AS CONCRETE BEING USED IN THE FORMATION OF THE WALL,SLAB, OR STRUCTURE.THE DEVICE IS SO LOCATED AS TO BE PLACED WITH THE OPPOSITEEND FLUSH WITH THE PLAMAR FORMWORK C OR SHUTTER C ANDFIXED WITH A TEMPORARY SCREW D .WHERE FIGURES 1 AND 2 ARE DISSIMILAR IS THE EMPLOYMENT OF A SPACEMAKER DEVICE WHICH HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED TO ACCOMMODATEBEING FITTED TO AND OVER THE END OF A CONDUIT OR PIPE WHICHOF NECESSITY INCLUDES A COUPLING OR ADAPTOR JOINT E FORFURTHER EXTENSION OF LENGTH AND ROUTE OF SUCH A CONDUIT.A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPACEMAKER DEVICE IS THE USEAND CONSTRUCTION OF MULTISIZE BOXES AND BOX OUTS F MANUFACTURED FROM PLASTIC OR OTHER MATERIAL AND USED TOCREATE SPACE AROUND A CONDUIT OR PIPE REQUIRED TO BE ROUTEDAND TERMINATED WITHIN WALLS, SLABS AND STRUCTURES FOR SUBSEQUENT LOCATION OF RECESSED OR FLUSH MOUNTED PROPRIETARYELECTRICAL OR OTHER BOXES. THESE BOXES AND BOXOUTS , l ARE DESCRIBED IN FIGURE NUMBERS 3 AND 4, THE SIMILARITY OF THESE BEING THE USE OF RECTANGULAR OR SQUARE PLASTIC OR OTHER MATERIAL BOXES HAVING PREFORMED CUTOUTS G OR KNOCKOUTS G TO ACCOMMODATE THELOCATION OF CONDUITS AND OR COUPLING ADAPTOR JOINTS. ALSOTHERE IS AN OPTIONAL LID H TO PREVENT INGRESS OF CONCRETEOR OTHER MATERIAL DURING FORMATION OF THE WALL, SLAB ORSTRUCTURE.THE DISSIMILARITY IS THAT THE BOXES FIGURE NO. 3 AREFORMED SPECIFICALLY TO SUIT STANDARD PROPRIETARY ELECTRICALBOXES WHEREAS BOXES SHOWN IN FIGURE NO. 4 PRESUMES PROPRIETARY BOXES ARE LOCATED SEPARATELY WITH THE PLASTIC BOXMERELY FORMING A SPACE FOR SUBSEQUENT PULLING, LOOPING, ANDFINAL CONNECTION OF CABLES AND WIRES TO ELECTRICAL UNITSTERMINALS AND DEVICES.
