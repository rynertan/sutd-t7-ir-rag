# APPARATUS FOR CHECKING THE GEOMETRY OF WHEELS

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises digital scales 11, 13 for reading the wheel angles having a plurality of columns including a sequence of black and white spaces arranged in conformity with a given binary code. The scales 11, 13 are projected onto detection flags 16, 17 having a slit 23 whereat optical electronic sensors 24 are arranged effec tive to detect the particular succession of black and white spaces in the column projected at the slit 23 , and supply it to an electronic processing unit 30 . Thus an apparatus is provided which eliminates the need of periodically check ing the calibration of its components, thereby reducing the time and costs involved in the checking operations, and providing precise and reliable results.
