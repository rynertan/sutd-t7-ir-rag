## Description
Title PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FURAN COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of furan compounds by the direct oxidation of conjugated diolefins with air or oxygen in the liquid phase in the presence of a transition metal catalyst system. Present processes for the direct oxidation of diolefins to furan compounds are primarily vapour phase processes which are generally characterized by low conversion and poor selectivity. These disadvantages result from the instability of furan compounds at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen, which leads to the formation of resinous compounds, charring and uncontrolled polymerization.The liquid phase process of the present invention eliminates these disadvantages by operating at moderate temperatures. Although several liquid phase processes are known for the production of furan compounds, they involve the use of oxygenated compounds as starting materials. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,932,468, and U.S. Patent No. 3,996,248, relate to the rearrangement of butadiene monoxide, and U.S. Patent No. 3,933, 861, relates to the reaction of an alkene and an alkene oxide to yield substituted furans. Both of these processes require oxygenated starting materials, whereas in the present invention, furan compounds are obtained by the direct oxidation of the on jugated diolefin. While Japanese Patent No. 77 77,049 discloses a process for the oxidation of butadiene to furan in an aqueous acidic medium, the process of the present invention is distinguished from this process in that the present process is conducted in an organic solvent medium in which the catalyst and furan products are more stable. According to the process of the present invention, an acyclic conjugated diolefin containing from 4 to 10 carbon atoms is converted to furan or an alkyl substituted furan compound by the direct oxidation of the diolefin with molecular oxygen in a liquid phase reaction. The reaction is carried out in a non aqueous reaction medium in the presence of a transition metal organo metallic catalyst complex. The liquid phase oxidation reaction of this invention is a free radical reaction, and these reactions appear to be initiated by means of the formation of an initial free radical. This irriL 1 free radical.may generate the desired product f directly, or proceed to form other radical intermediates which can yield either furan, other oxygenated products, such as a diolefin monoxide, 2,5 dihydrofuran, crotonaldehyde, or oligomers and or polymers. The role of the catalyst of this invention is to react with the initial key radical intermediates, converting them directly to furan products before deleterious by products can be produced. It is this selective catalytic behavior, coupled with specific reaction conditions herein defined, that result in the enhanced selectivity of the oxidation of the diolefins to the desired furan compounds. The invention therefore provides a process for the conversion of an acyclic conjugated diolefinic hydrocarbon containing from 4 to 10 carbon atoms to furan or an alkyl substituted furan which comprises reacting the conjugated diolefin with molecular oxygen in the liquid phase characterised in that the reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst having the composition RXM L yz in which R represents an organic ligand which is an alkyl, aryl, alkene, diene, triene, or alkyne radical containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms L represents a ligand which is carbon monoxide and a halogen M represents a transition metal or mixture of transition metals from Groups IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic classification of elements x is O to 2, y is O to 6 x y is 1 to 6 and z is 1 to 6. Suitable feeds in this invention for conversion to furan compounds comprise acyclic alkadienes having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples include butadiene 1,3, pentadiene 1,3, isoprene, hexadiene 1,3, and decadiene 1,3, and mixtures thereof. The acyclic alkadienes having from 4 to 5 carbon atoms are preferred in this process. The furan compounds produced by the process of the present invention have the formula EMI4.1 in which each R which may be the same or different represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the total carbon atoms in the R radicals being in the range of O to 6.Representative compounds include furan, 2 methylfuran, 3 methylfuran, 2, 5 diethylfuran, 2 n hexylfuran, 2 isopropyl 3 meth.l furan, 3,4 n dipropylfuran and 3 methyl 4 n butylfuan. The catalysts for use in the process of this invention are organo metallic complexes or salts of the metals of Groups IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB or VIII of thePeriodic classification of elements. These complexes have the general formula RxM L y z in which R represents an Organic ligand which is an alkyl, k alkene, diene, triene or alkyne radical containing from 1 to S carbon atoms L represents a ligand which i carbon monoxide or a halogen M represents a transition metal or a mixture of transition metals from the Groups IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic classification of elements x is O to 2 y is O to 6 x y is 1 to 6 and z is 1 to 6.Specific examples of suitable catalysts include OsCl Os3 CO 12, CpMo CO 3 2 Cp cyclopentadienyl rz ci CpV CO 4, C1 TiCj2, CpMn CO 3, Cp 2Fe, Mo CO 6, CpFe CO2 2, C4H6, Fe C0 3, Co2 CO , RU3 CO 1S, Rh6 C lb and W CO 6. While these complexes and salts are effective catalysts in their own right, it may also be advantageous to utilize certain promotors for these catalysts as defined by the general formula AR X m n in which A represents mercury, thallium, indium, or a Group IV A element such as silicon, germanium, tin or lead R represents a hydride, alkyl, aryl or amine group X represents an anion of a mineral acid or carboxylic acid m is 0 4 n is 0 4 and m n is 1 to 4. Specific examples of these types of promoters include such compounds as Hg C2H502 2, SnC12, C2H5 2 SnCl2, SnCl4, CH3 SnN CH3 2, Gel2, n C4Hg 3GeI, s C5H5 Ge CH3 3, C2H5 3 PbCl, CH3 3 SiH, or SiH3I. When promoters are employed for the catalysts of this invention, they may be added to the reaction mixture as separate species or they may be reacted with the catalyst to give a separate chemical compound which can be isolated and purified prior to its use as a catalytic agent. Representative examples of compounds formed by reactions occurring between the catalyst and the promoter include ClHgFe Cp 2, HgCo CO 4 0, C12Sn Fe CO 2Cp 2, 12Ge Co CO 4 2, C2H5 3Pb 2Fe CO 4, H3SiCo CO 4, Cl CH3 2Sn Mn C0 5 , and ren C o Sn CH 2 Mn CO 5 . Tile promoter compounds of the catalyst system arc preferably used in molar ratios of from 0.25 to 2.0 moles of promoter per mole of the transition metal catalyst. Particularly preferred molar ratios of promoter compound to transition metal catalyst are from 0.5 1 to 2 1. The catalysts used in the process of this invention, with or without promoters may be dissolved in the reaction medium as homogeneous catalysts, slurried in the reaction medium as insoluble, unsupported heterogeneous catalysts, or in some cases where advantageous, they may be supported on carriers such as silica, alumina, or polymeric materials and slurried in the reaction medium. It is however preferred, that the catalyst system is a homogeneous system where the catalyst is soluble in the reaction solvent.The concentration of the catalyst in the solvent medium may range from 10 to 10.0 moles liter. A catalyst concentration of from about 10 5 to 1.0 moles liter is preferably used. The reaction medium suitable for the process of this invention is an essentially inert, non coordinating or weakly coordinating organic solvent having a boiling point significantly higher than the boiling points of the feed or the products obtained. Solvents with boiling points of from 1300 to 2250C are especially preferred. Those solvents having an absence of abstractable hydrogens which could lead to oxidation of the solvent or the binding of the active sites of the metal or metals in the catalyst, thereby deactivating the catalyst, are also preferred.Examples of suitable solvents include paraffinic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and nitrile aromatics such as heptanes and decanes, toluene and the xylenes chlorobenzene, chloroform and carbon tetra chloride and benzonitrile with chlorobenzene being ilie most preferred. Substituted furans such as alkylfurans or 2,3 benzofuran may also serve as suitable solvents in some cases. The oxidation reaction of the present invention is very sensitive to reaction conditions and it is an essential feature of the invention that the reaction is carried out under conditions which maximize selectivity. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature in the range of from 200 to 2000C, and preferably at a temperature in the range of from about 500 to 1300C. Temperatures above this range result in the formation of additional oxidation products such as crotonaldehyde and increase the formation of undesirable polymer. The reaction pressure may range from 1 to 20 atmospheres, and preferably from 1 to 10 atmospheres.The partial pressure of oxygen is of particular importance to the selectivity of the reaction, and oxygen pressures of from 0.5 to 5 atmospheres, especially from 1 to 3 atmospheres, are preferably employed. Another critical reaction variable affecting the selectivity of the reaction is the ratio of diolefin to oxygen. While the molar ratio of diolefin to oxygen may vary from 0.001 to 100.0, a ratio of from 0.33 to 5.0 is preferred. Where the reaction is carried out in a sealed reaction vessel, the reaction times may range from 0.5 to 10 hours and a reaction time of from 1.0 to 4 hours is preferable. Continuous operation in which the reaction mixture is maintained at constant temperature and pressure is also within the scope of the present invention. Under such conditions, the diolefin and air or oxygen are fed conilnuously to the reactor while volatile products and the unreacted feed are removed continuously. The volatile products ar be collected and the unreacted feed recycled to tlie reactor. The reactor vessel may be constructed from stainless steel, or in certain instances the reaction vessel may be lined with glass, quartz or a stable resinous material in order to minimise side reactions between reaction intermediates and the walls of the reaction vessel. The invention will now be further described with reference to the following Examples. EXAMPLES 1 12 The oxidation of butadiene to furan in the presence of a variety of promoted and unpromoted transition metal catalyst complexes was conducted in a series of experiments according to the following procedure An amount of catalyst require give a concen tration of 1 x 10 4 moles of catalyst he reaction solvent was weighed into a stainless steel reaction tube 180 mm long x 9.5 mm diameter equipped ffltjl stainless steel ball valve and septum cap.
