# Self sequencing data bus allocation system.

## Abstract
A plurality of data communication devices of the type which operate to communicate with a data bus responsive to the receipt of a prescribed voltage are triggered automatical ly in a prescribed sequence without separate addressing from a central point. Each data communication device which may be uni or bi directional is connected to a common multi wire electrical cable by means of a control station, which taps a power supply line from the main cable and directs the power to its corresponding data communication device. The data communication device is thus activated so as to permit it to transmit its data onto the data bus of the main cable. Upon completion, the data communication device ceases drawing power which indicates to the system that it has finished, whereupon the next in line control station initiates the process with its corresponding data communication device.
