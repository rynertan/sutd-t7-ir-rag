# Use of polyethylene terephthalate copolyester in forming films and moulded articles.

## Abstract
Copolyester comprising 2 to 20 mole of units of sulfonyl diphenol or isomers and 98 to 80 mole ethylene terephthal ate prepolymer units, and methods for making the copolyester are disclosed. In a method for making the copolyester sulfonyl diphenol is added during the polycondensation reaction of ethylene terephthalate prepolymer. Catalyst systems used therein may comprise titanium and antimony compounds or a tin compound. The copolyester finds uses in forming clear films and moulded articles.
