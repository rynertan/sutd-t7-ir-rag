# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device used, for example, for graphic data storage of a graphic display apparatus and so on, in which the data is read out not only from a target memory cell designated by an input address signal but also from one or more memory cells whose locations have predetermined relation ship with the target memory cell. The semiconductor memory device comprises memory cells, MC00, MC01, ... data lines BL0, BL1, ... a plurality of data buses DB 1 , DB, DB 1 , and a data line selecting circuit Q00...Q52... . The data line select ing circuit connects a selected data line designated by an ad dress signal to a particular data bus and connects one or more data lines whose locations have predetermined relationships to that of the selected data line to other data buses which are dif ferent from the particular data bus. The signal of a designated data line is output to the particular data bus whichever data line is designated.
