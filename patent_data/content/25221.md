# Flat display device.

## Abstract
A flat display device comprises a vacuum envelope con stituted by a back base plate 11 consisting of an elastic metal plate and a display panel 8 and accommodating a thermionic cathode structure 14 and a plurality of electrode structures 15, 16, 18 for controlling the electron beams emitted from the thermionic cathode structure. The thermionic cathode structure is divided into a plurality of sections each including a plurality of coiled thermionic cathode heaters 19 connected in parallel and arranged such that each corresponds to each of picture element regions 10 provided on the back side of the display panel. Voltage supply terminals for supplying power to the parallel coiled heaters in each section are led out through the back base plate 11 via insulating members.
