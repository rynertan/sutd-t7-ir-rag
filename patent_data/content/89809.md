# Method for the production of fibre reinforced articles.

## Abstract
A method for the production by resin injection moulding of fibre reinforced articles from fibrous material bonded in a curable matrix material which articles comprise two or more spokes 2, 3, 4 extending from a hub portion 1 , each spoke 2, 3, 4 being in the form of a loop is characterised in that the fibrous material is arranged such that at least as many rovings 13, 14, 15 or 22, 23, 24 of the fibrous material as there are spokes 2, 3, 4 extend in continuous paths from the hub portion 1 around each of the spokes, each of the rovings being overlaid for at least part of its length by each of the other rovings. The method is suitable for the production of intricately shaped articles which are to be highly stressed for example by being subjected to high rotational speeds.
