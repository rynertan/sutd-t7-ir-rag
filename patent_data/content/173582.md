# HEAVY WALL OPTICAL FIBER CABLE

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an optical fiber cable assembly 12 having a heavy wall tubular structure for im parting improved strength properties and current carrying capabilities to the cable assembly. The heavy wall tubular structure is formed by two or more drawn tubes 14, 50 bonded together by a low temperature metal or metal alloy filler material 47 and is used to protect one or more optical fibers 26 . A process and apparatus for forming the cable assembly are also described.
