## Description
The present invention relates to decoder driver circuits for semiconductor memories, and more particularly to a circuit that can be used as a word line decoder driver or a bit line decoder driver in a CMOS random access memory. A variety of decoder circuits for semiconductor memories are available in the art. In U.S. Patent 4,309,629 issued January 5, 1982 to Kamuro, entitled MOS TRANSISTOR DECODER CIRCUIT, an MOS transistor decoder circuit is disclosed including a plurality of MOS transistors and at least one load element. At least one additional MOS transistor connected to the plurality of MOS transistors and the load element for selecting either of two output terminals for the plurality of MOS transistors, through which decoded output signals are developed. The two additional MOS transistors connected to the two output terminals have normal and complement bit signals, respectively. In U.S. Patent 4,264,828 issued April 28, 1981 to Perlegos et al, entitled MOS STATIC DECODING CIRCUIT, a metal oxide semiconductor static decoding circuit for selecting an addressed line in a high density memory array, or the like, is disclosed. The circuit is laid out along array lines where the lines have a given pitch. Three levels of decoding are employed. The highest level permits the pulling up of a common node in the second level decoder. The third level of decoding selects one of a plurality of array lines coupled to this node. Zero threshold voltage MOS devices are employed for coupling the first and third decoders to the second decoder. In U.S. Patent 4,259,731 issued March 31, 1981 to Moench, entitled QUIET ROW SELECTION CIRCUITRY, there is provided a quiet row select circuit for holding unselected word lines or row select lines in a memory array at a predetermined voltage potential. Transistors are used to couple each row select line to the predetermined voltage potential. The adjacent row select lines of at least one of the adjacent select lines is always coupled to the predetermined voltage when in an unselected state. A transistor is also used to couple each of the adjacent row select lines together and this transistor is enabled whenever the adjacent row select lines are non selected so that both row select lines are coupled together to the predetermined voltage level. In another reference of Moench, U.S. Patent 4,200,917 issued April 29, 1980, entitled QUIET COLUMN DECODER, a decoder is provided for semiconductor memory systems which prevents glitches from being coupled into the silicon substrate during the period of time that the sense amplifiers are sensing data on the bit sense lines. The quiet column decoder has double clock NOR gates which allows the address lines to be continuous non multiplexed lines. The double clocked NOR gate has two transistors for precharging a first and a second node within the NOR gate. Another transistor is coupled between the second node and a voltage reference terminal to serve as an enabling device for the NOR gate. The first node of the NOR gate serves as an output for the column decoder. In U.S. Patent 4,429,374 issued January 31, 1984 to Tanimura, entitled MEMORY ARRAY ADDRESSING, an address decoder for one memory axis is disclosed which comprises NAND circuits while the address decoder for the other axis comprises NOR circuits. A semiconductor memory circuit device comprises at least first and second decoder circuits. The first decoder circuit is so constructed as to receive at least partial address signals among address signals of a plurality of bits and to provide decoded signals of the partial address signals as intermediate signals. The second decoder circuit is so constructed as to receive the intermediate signals, to thereby provide signals for selecting from among a plurality of memory circuits a memory circuit determined by the address signals of the plurality of bits. A publication entitled CMOS Decoder Circuit by L M Terman, at page 2135 of Vol 25, No 4, September 1982 of the IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin relates to improvements in CMOS decoder circuits, and particularly to a decoder circuit which does not dissipate DC power. The decoder is followed with two branches with CMOS drivers for word lines. In Vol 18, No 12, May 1976 of the IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, G H Parikh in a publication entitled High Speed FET Decoder , on page 3955 describes a field effect transistor decoder circuit which allows improved speed of decoding FET random access memories, by reducing the capacitance required to be discharged in an unselected decoder. The speed is further increased by reducing the capacitance of the nodes to be discharged wherein isolation transistor devices are provided to isolate the capacitance on word line voltage nodes to allow bootstrapping to occur if a node has not been discharged. European Patent application EP 0,056 187 discloses a complementary metal insulated semiconductor CMIS memory decoder which is useful for a highly integrated large capacity ROM or RAM. It describes circuits in which NOR and NAND decoders are used and in which transistors, directly connected to the output node of the decoder, are used as switches to select word lines for driving. Such direct connection loads the output node of the decoder with a high capacitance and hence incurs a loss in speed of response. Other related prior art includes the following references An object of the present invention is to provide a high performance decoder driver that can be used as a word line decoder driver or a bit line decoder driver in high performance CMOS RAMs. There are many advantages of the decoder compared to other decoder driver circuits including the use of a relatively small number of devices. In addition, other objects of the present invention is to provide decoder driver circuits for CMOS memories which have a smaller line pitch thereby permitting a denser array. A further object of the present invention is to provide a memory decoder driver circuit that exhibits no dc power dissipation. Still other objects of the present invention are to provide decoder driver circuits for CMOS memories which demonstrate high performance with no clocking after the address lines have switched, while requiring no long chain of series connected devices, minimizing the stages of delay to select a word line, and minimizing the loading on address lines. Accordingly, the invention provides a decoder driver circuit for a semiconductor memory comprising a NOR decoder means connected to true and complement lines of a plurality of A1 to AN 1 memory address bits for receiving said memory address bit signals thereon, said NOR decoder means further including an output node having a high signal condition thereon when all said plurality of designated address bit signals A1 to AN 1 connected thereto are at a low signal condition and having a low signal condition thereon when any of said plurality of designated address bit signals A1 to AN 1 have a high signal condition, an output word line driver means connected to a first memory word line and a second memory word line, characterised by a first field effect transistor FET having a gate connected to the true line of an AN memory address bit signal and a second field effect transistor FET having a gate connected to the complement line of said AN memory address bit signal, said first and second FETs each being connected with one electrode to the input of said word line driver means, a third field effect transistor FET having a gate connected to said output node of said NOR decoder means and an electrode connected to a predetermined potential, said third FET being connected with its other electrode to the other electrodes of said first and second FETs and forming a conduction path isolated from said NOR decoder output node for said first and second FETs when said third FET is switched on in response to a high signal condition on said NOR decoder output node, whereby a high signal condition on said true line connected to said first FET switches said conductive path to enable said word line driver means to drive said first word line, and whereby a high signal condition on said complement line connected to said second FET switches said conductive path to enable said word line driver means to drive said second word line. The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which A schematic diagram of a decoder driver circuit is shown in Fig 1.

Devices 41, 42, 43...44 are connected in a conventional NOR circuit configuration, well known to those skilled in the art. Lines A1 through AN are internal address lines from the address buffers, and the first A1 AN 1 are connected to the inputs of the NOR circuit in the conventional manner. That is, the gate of each device in the NOR circuit is connected to either the true or complement address line for the corresponding address bit from the address buffers. The N 1 address bits are connected to 2 The functional operation of the proposed circuit will now be described. At the start of a cycle, the address lines The decoding function of the circuit is summarized in Table 1, where the state of decoder node 14 will be high in precharge and remains high if the NOR is selected it goes low if the decoder is deselected. If the NOR is deselected node 14 low , neither word line WLi or WLi 1 can be selected, while if it is selected node 14 high either WLi or WLi 1 will be selected, depending on whether AN or Towards the end of the cycle, the clock signal R goes up and all address line signals A1 through AN as well as It is necessary to have the least significant internal address bit signal AN The circuit in FIG. 6 is an alternative embodiment of the invention which selects two driver outputs running in opposite directions for each associated selecting address input. A modified version of FIG. 6 which uses less devices is shown in FIG. 7. A physical layout of the schematic shown in FIG. 7 may be simpler than that of FIG. 6. The circuit has a number of advantageous features. There is only one NOR circuit per pair of word lines or per two pairs of word lines as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 . After the address lines switch, no clocking is required before the selected word line rises. This and the low number of delay stages results in high performance. There is no dc power consumed, and dynamic charge storage is required only for a short well defined portion of the cycle. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that alternative embodiments of the invention may be provided wherein the n type devices may be replaced by p type devices, and vice versa. Also, another inverter may be provided at the output to change the polarity of each output and inverted input signals may be used.
