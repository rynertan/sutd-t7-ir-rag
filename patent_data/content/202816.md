# Stackable rotary vane pump with improved volumetric efficiency.

## Abstract
A rotary vane pump 150 includes a shaft 164 of uniform diameter over at least the portion of its length passing through a cavity 180 in a liner member 162 which is eccentric to the shaft and a pair of end bearings 158,160 defining opposite end faces of the cavity. Vanes 170 176 extend from the shaft into contact with the eccentric cavity and define pumping pockets which expand and contract as the shaft rotates. The rotating shaft 164 is mounted substantially tangent to the cavity 180 in the liner 162 and is journal mounted in such end bearings 158, 160 which seal opposite ends of the pumping pockets. The vanes 170 176 are positioned axially of the shaft by means of a groove 222 formed in one end face of the liner and corresponding tabs 200 206 which project radially from each of the vanes. Alternatively, the groove 232 may be formed by providing a separate wafer 230 adjacent one end of the pump liner 228 having an internal bore 232 of a greater diameter than the internal diameter 229 of the liner. By providing the shaft 164 with a uniform diameter over a substantial portion of its length, multiple pumping units 266 268, 280 282 may be mounted on such uniform dia meter portion.
