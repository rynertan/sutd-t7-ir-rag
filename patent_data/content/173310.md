# WEIGHING MECHANISM

## Abstract
The specification discloses a balance for measuring a load F . This balance uses an electronic or optical trans ducer and a parallelogram support 11 for the load F to be weighed. The parallelogram linkage 11, 12, 14, 15 uses one or more torsion bars 25, 26a, 26, 27, 28, 29 to resilient ly support the load F , wherein the deflection of the paral lelogram is proportional to the weight of the load F . When used with a capacitance transducer, the parallelogram link age also enables the capacitor plates 20, 21 to remain par allel to one another as the parallelogram is loading, thereby producing a signal that can be electronically processed to provide a linear digital read out signal on indication of weight. Electronic data processing means 31 38 as pro vided to calculate and display on indication of weight and or volume. An optional optical indicator means 12c is also disclosed to provide an optical reading of the weight of the load F .
