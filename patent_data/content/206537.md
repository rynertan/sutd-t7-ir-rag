For convenience, the phytoactive canpounds containing the moiety of Formula I will herein after be designated 9MCM compounds. A large nunber of phytoactlve PMCM compounds are known in the art. The term phytoactive as used in describing this invention means effective as a plant growth regulator, as a herbicide, as a defoliant or the like.

These patents are illustrative and are incorporated herein by reference. Most of these patents also include descriptions of processes employed to prepare such compounds. The following patents provide additional process descriptions U.S. Patent 3,288,846, Irani et al., November 29, 1966, entitled Process for Preparing Organic Phosphonic Acids U.S. Patent 4,507,250, Bakel, March 26, 1985, entitled Process for Producing N Phosphoncmethylglycine Acid U.S. Patent 4,147,719, Franz, April 3, 1979, entitled Pro cess for Producing N fhosphorxaethylglycine and U.S.Patent 4,487,724, Felix, December 11, t984, entitled Process for Preparation N Phosphonomethylglycine Salts . These patents are also incorporated herein by reference. PMCM compounds, in particular water soluble PMCM salts, are often difficult to obtain in a solid form. They can be difficult to crystallize and isolate from aqueous solutions. They can form glassy, noncrystalline solids which transform rapidly into wet cakes When exposed to the air. Commercial formulations of PMCM compounds are generally not sold in a solid form, but sold as aqueous solutions. These solutions often contain only about 50 PMCM compound. Oonsequently, there is substantial waste in terms of storage, transportation charges and container disposal. EMCM compounds in water are usually acidic and exhibit chelating properties. Iron and aluminum tend to inactivate the phytoactivity of the compounds. They can react with unlined or galvinized steel to prcduce hydrogen gas which can form a highly canbustible gas mixture. If ignited, this mixture can flash or explcde, which may cause serious personal injury.Therefore, aqueous solutions of the compounds are usually stored and transported in plastic or specially lined steel containers. It would be desirable to package and sell iMCM compounds in a solid form in order to realize substantial savings in terms of storage, transporation and container disposal charges and to avoid the problems associated with i3 1CM solutions. Representative patents generally disclosing wettable powders containing PMCM compounds include U.S. Patents 4,025,331 4,414,158 4,481,026 and 4,405,531. They broadly disclose wettable powders containing a EMCY canpound, an inert solid extender, and one or more surfactants.A disadvantage of such wettable powders is that the solid extender reduces the amount of active ingredients which can be transported in a container of a particular size. A further disadvantage is that many of the phytoactive canpounds desirably contained in such powders, particularly PMCM salts, are hygroscopic or deliquescent. Great care is needed in packaging, storage and use of such wettable powders. If a final user chooses to employ only a portion of such a powder, extensive precautions must be taken to ensure the stability of the remainder. It has now been found, however, that phytoactive PMCM canposi tions are readily obtained in a solid form which is substantially nonhygroscopic or non deliquescent. Illustrative of a preferred process in accordance with the invention for preparing such solid canpositions is the process of a forming an initial mixture comprising a phytoactive PMCM compound, a solvent and a molten surfactant, the surfactant being solid at ambient temperatures b removing solvent from the initial mixture at a temperature above the melting point of the surfactant to form a final mixture c cooling the final mixture to a temperature below the melting point of the surfactant to form an N phosphonomethyl N carboxymethyl com Fosition which is solid at ambient temperatures and d processing said composition into particulate form, such as pellets, flakes, granules, or powders. As used herein, the term solid refers to the physical state wherein the composition has a specific shape and volume ard resists deformation. The solid may be processed into any suitable particulate form, such as pellets, flakes, granules, or powder. The solid composition can subsequently be dissolved in a suitable diluent, usually and preferably water, at a remote field site, and applied to the plants upon which the composition s phytoactivity is to be directed. Any liquid dispersible, phytoactive PMCM compound can be used in the compositions and processes in accordance with the invention The term liquid dispersibleW is used in a broad sense to encompass compounds which are soluble in a liquid as well as compounds which are merely dispersible.In preferred eibcdiments, the EMCM compound is liouid soluble. In most preferred embodiments, it is water soluble. The PMCM compounds may be represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Z is hydrogen, an organic moiety or an inorganic moiety. Pepre sentative patents disclosing PMC compounds wherein Z is other than hdro gen include U.S. Patent Nos. 3,888,915 3,933,946 4,062,699 4,119,430 4,322,239 and 4,084,953. In preferred PMCM compounds, Z is hydrogen or an organic substituent.

A preferred tertiary nitrogen substituted PMCM compound is N,N bis phosphonomethyl glycine. Those EMCM compounds wherein Z is hydrogen are most preferred when the phytoactivity desired is herbicidal activity. Representative R s include halogen, NHOH, oR2, R21 SR2 and QM, where R1 is independently selected from hydrogen alkyl or hydroxyalkyl, preferably containing less than about 5 carbon atoms alkenyl, preferably containing less than about 5 carbon atoms or phenyl moieties.R2 is independently selected from hydrogen alkyl hydroxyalkyl or chloroalkyl, preferably containing less than about 5 carbon atoms alkoxy, preferably containing less than about 5 carbon atoms alkyleneanine, preferably containing less than about 12 carbon atoms phenyl or benzyl moieties. M is selected from hydrogen and agriculturally acceptable saltforming moieties such as alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, stannic, ammonium, organic ammonium, alkylsulfonium, alkylsulfoxonium, alkylphosphonium moieties or combinations thereof. Representative patents disclosing at least some of such compounds include U.S. Patents 3,799,758 4,397,676 4,140,513 4,315,765 3,868,407 4,405,531 4,481,026 4,414,158 4,120,689 4,472,189 4,341,549 and 3,948,975.

It should be noted that the alkaline earth metal salts, while agriculturally acceptable, provide only marginal herbicidal activity. In preferred compositions according to this invention, M is independently selected frcm the above described agriculturally acceptable salt forming moieties and hydrogen. In more preferred compositions, H is an alkali metal, ammonium, monoalkylammonium, or trialkylsulfonium moiety.In most preferred compositions only one M is an alkali metal, amnonium, monoalkyl ammonium, or trialkylsulfonium moiety, while the other two M s are hydrogen. Representative most preferred compositions include isopropylamine N phosphonomethylglycine , trimethylslfonium N phosphonomethylglycine and sodium sesquiN Fhosphorxmethylglyc ine. Combinations of two or more EMCM compounds can be employed in the compositions and processes in accordance with the invention. The choice of the particular surfactant to be used with a PHCM compound is important. The choice of a particular surfactant to be used in connection with a particular PMCM compound will be easily made by one skilled in the art, without undue experimentation based on the teachings of this application. W hatever surfactant is used, it must be a solid at ambient temperature, i.e, it must have a high melting point. Preferred surfactants have a melting point above 50 C. The surfactant should also not be hygroscopic or deliquescent. When solid, the surfacant should be readily soluble or dispersible in the diluent chosen by the ultimate user of the phytoactive composition.In preferred embodiments, the solid surfactant is soluble in water. The surfactant should cause a minimum amount of foaming, particularly urner vacuum, when the solvent is removed during the processes in accordance with the invention and should cause a minimum amount of foaming when the final prcduct is subsequently mixed with the diluent. It is particularly important that the surfactant is solid at ambient temperatures. In practical terms, it must be solid at the highest temperatures to which the solid produce may be exposed before it is mixed with the diluent by the ultimate user. Such temperatures are generally in the range of from about 20 to 50 C. Preferred surfactants for use in the invention are nonionic block copolymers of alkyl oxides having a functional groupEMI7.1 where R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen,EMI7.2 and wherein R7 is selected from an alkyl having from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms or an alkylaryl group, wherein the alkyl portion of the alkylaryl group ranges from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof, and wherein m ranges from about 20 to about 200, n ranges from about 0 to about 10, and m n is equal to or greater than about 25. Examples of R7 include sorbitan, fatty radicals such as coco, oleyl, palmityl, tallow, stearyl, lauryl, soya, castor, nonylphenoxy, d inonyl phenoxy, octylphenoxy, and d ioc tyl phenoxy. Preferred nonionic surfactants for use in the compositions of the invention include Pluronic surfactants, such as Pluronic F 38, F 68,F 77, F 87, F 88, F 89, F 108 and F 127. The Pluronic surfactants are available commercially EFSF , and comprise ethylene oxide or propylene oxide block copolamers. The advantages of the use of a nonionic surfactant in the process and compositions of this invention are that they are generally inexpensive readily available, low or non irritating, often of low toxicity to mammals and generally, low or non foaming when under vacuum in a molten state. Other surfactants can be used, such as cationic, anionic, or amphoteric surfactants. However, they may give rise to foaming. They also may be more toxic to mammals. Such other surfactants include Emcol CC 57 cationic , Arquad C 50 cationic , Ethomeen 18 12 cationic , Ethomeen 18 15 cationic ,Ethomeen 18 60 cationic , Ethomeen T 60 cationic , Alkaphos K 380 anionic and Witconate AOK anionic . Mixtures of various non ionic surfactants, or nonionics with cationic, anionic or amphoteric surfactants, can also be used if desired. The following surfactants, among others, have been found to be useful in the processes and compositions of this invention. TABLE I Surfactant Manufacturer Structure Type m.p.

Therefore, some embodiments of the invention include an anti foaming agent. The anti foaming agent may be added any time before the solvent is removed. Representative of useful anti foaming agents include compounds such as Silcolapse 5008 silicone based anti foam and Anti foam EmulsionQ 94 SWS Silicones Corp. . In addition to the PMCM compound, the surfactant and the antifoaming agents, the composition can also include other conventional adjuvants such as drying aids, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers, dispersants, wetting agents, and other agriculturally acceptable materials.Representative drying aids include Microcel E, Aerosil 200, and Hi SilX 233. Representative heat stabilizers include phenylenediamines, phenazine, butylated hydroxy toluene. Representative ultraviolet absorbers include Tinuvin 770, Tinuvin P, and dinitroanilines. The ratio of PMC compound to surfactant varies over a wide range. Since it is known that the choice of a particular surfactant can affect the photoactivity of the EMC compounds used in accordance with this invention, the desired activity of the solid composition should be considered when selecting a particular surfactant. As much surfactant as desired may be employed so long as the products dissolve totally or disperse readily in the diluent prior to the apolicaton. For cost considers tions, a minimum of surfactant should be used which still enables tbe objects of the invention to be obtained, e.g., the production of a solid product which is substantially non hygroscopic. The ratio of EMCM compound to surfactants by weight, is typically from about 10 1 to about 1 10. me preferred ratio is from about 4 1 to about 1 2. The most preferred ratio is from about 2 1 to about 1 1. Representative formulations of the compositions of this invention are as follows. The formulations are based on percent by weight, unless otherwise noted. 69.3 trimethylsulfonium salt of N phosphonomethylglYcine 30.7 F 108 m.p. 57 C 100 Total 69.3 isopropylamine salt of N phosphonomethylglycine 30.7 Tetronic 909 m.p. 590C 100 Total 69.3 isopropylamine salt of N phosphonomethylglycine 30.7 Pluronic F 108 m.p. 57 C 100 Total The solid compositions in accordance with this invention are characterized in that the PMCM compound forms an intimate mixture with the surfactant. The PMCM compound is initially dispersed throughout a surfactant matrix. It is believed that such an intimate dispersion prevents absorption of moisture by the PMCM compounds. The compositions of this invention can be prepared in any suitable manner. A preferred process, however, comprises first preparing a mixture containing the PMCM compound and the solvent. In preferred edbod iments, the PMCM compound is dissolved in the solvent. In other embody ments, the P GM compound is dispersed therein. In some embodiments, the mixture is prepared by forming the PMCM compound in situ. For example, in sane embodiments, N phosphonomethylgly cine is reacted with a desired base, in the presence of water, to form an aqueous solution containing the PMCM compound. In preferred embcdiments, solutions of isopropylanine N phosphoncmethylglycine can be prepared in this manner. The choice of the solvent for use in accordance with the process of the invention is not critical, but the solvent must meet certain requirements. The solvent must be capable of dissolving or dispersing a desired EMCM compound at the temperature used to form the initial mixture, without adversely effecting the PMCM ccmpound s phytoactivity. The greater the solublity or ease of dispersibility of the PMCM compound in solvent, the less solvent will be required and the subsequent removal of solvent will be facilitated. It is preferred that the normal boiling point of the solvent is greater than the melting of the particular surfactant chosen. However, what is most important is that the solvent be removed at a temperature greater than the surfactant s melting point. Consequently, where the normal boiling point of the solvent is less than the melting point of the surfactant, the solvent must be remcved under elevated pressure. Preferred solvents include water and polar organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and acetone. Water is most preferred. The third component of the initial mixture is the surfactant.The surfactant may be added by conventional techniques to the solvent before, during or after the addition of the PMCM compound. Preferably, the surfactant is added in the molten state, although in scme embodiments it is initially merely dissolved or dispersed in the solvent and the temperature then raised above the melting point of the surfactant. Initial use of a molten surfactant permits easy mixing and can aid in reducing the amount of solvent, which is required. In those embodiments where the molten surfactant is itself capable of dissolving or dispersing the desired PMCM compound, it can be employed in lieu of the solvent. In order to form or maintain the molten surfactant, the lower limit on the temperature of the initial mixture is the melting point of the surfactant. Ihe upper limit is the temperature at which a particular PMCM ccmFound, surfactant or other additives will decompose. When tri alkyl sul foni un N pho sphoncmethylglye ines are chosen as a FMCM compound, temperatures in the range of 30 to 110 C are generally employed. The solvent is then removed from the initial mixture. Any solvent removal technique can be employed, so long as the temperature is below the decomposition temperature is above the melting point of the surfactant. Representative techniques include heating and vacuum techniques and ccmbinations of both. Fbr example, the final mixture can simply be heated to a temperature sufficient to evaporate the solvent of the above requirements are met. The temperature at which the solvent is evaporated is a function of temperature, absolute pressure and composition of the mixture. Thus, if a reduced pressure is employed, removal of the solvent can be achieved at lower temperatures. A preferred device for solvent removal at reduced pressure is an industrial type film evaporator. Because the residence time of the product in the device is very short, any decomposition which may tend to occur is minimized. In carrying out the process of this invention, atmospheric con ditions are most preferred for solvent removal because they eliminate the use of special equipment, or special techniques for maintaining a vacuum and for removing the resulting solid composition from such equipment. As the solvent is removed at temperatures above the melting point of the surfactant and higher concentrations of surfactant are contained in the mixture, a viscous final mixture is formed. Upon cooling, the final mixture readily solidifies. It is not necessary to remove all the solvent from the final mixture. All that is required is that sufficient solvent be removed so that the final ccmposlticn solidifies upon cooling. In preferred embcdiments, however, substantially all the solvent is removed. The resulting solid composition can then be processed into any suitable particulate form, such as pellets, flakes, granules, or powder, by conventional techniques. As will be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art, the size of the final particle will affect the ease of solution or dispersion of the final product in the diluent by the ultimate user. Generally, the ease of solution or dispersion increases as particle size decreases. In contrast, however, the ease of handling thefinal product increases as particle size increases. The more soluble or dispersible the solid composition, the larger the particle size that can be employed. In preferred ebbed iments, the final product is processed into particles ranging from powders having a diameter of about 3 to about 15 microns, to granules, having a diameter of about 8 to about 30 mesh to flakes. The following examples illustrate production of the compositions of the invent on in accordance with the process described herein. All percefltTes are based or weight, unless othe ise clearly indicate.

EXAMPLE XI A composition was prepared as in Example I, except for using 300 g of Pluronic F 88 block copolymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide from BASF, m.p. 54 C as the surfactant, 574 g of a 58 aqueous trimethylsulfoniun N phosphonomethylglycine solution, 10 drops of Silcolapse 5008 and mixing in a 2 liter round bottomed flask. The solid obtained did not deliquesce upon standing in the open. The phytoactive compositions of this invention are effective when subsequently dissolved or dispersed in a suitable diluent, preferably water, and applied to thelocus desired by spray or other conventional menas. Conventional adjuvants, including wetting agents, penetrating agents, spreading or sticking agents, carriers, extenders and conditioning agents, such as dispersing agents can be added to the final solution or dispersion. the following examples demonstrate the herbicidal effectiveness of the compositions of the invention. The effectiveness was cbserved by comparing the extent of weed control in test containers treated with the PMCM compositons in accordance with the invention with that occurring in similar control containers. The soil used in these tests was a sandy loam soil from the Livermcre, California area. The soil was treated by the addition of 17 17 17 fertilizer NP2O5 K2O on on a weight basis , amounting to 50 ppn by weight, with respect to the soil, and CAPTANR, a soil fungicide. The thus treated soil was then placed in plastic tubs, 6 inches in diameter and 5 inches deep with drainage holes. Johnsongrass rhizomes,Bermuda grass cuttings and purple nutsedge tubers were planted in the test containers. The test weeds were as follows Conrmon Name Scientific NameWeeds A. Johnsongrass Sorghum halepense B. Bermuda grass Cynodon dactylon C. purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus Sufficient stock or cuttings were planted to produce several seedlings per container. After planting, the containers were placed in a greenhouse maintained at 21 to 30 C and watered daily with a sprinkler. A variety of PMCM compositions based on trimethylsulfoniun N phosphonomethylglycine were sprayed on the seedling approximately 35 days after planting. The compositions are shown in Table IV. Composition 1 was a liquid formulation. Compositions 2 through 13 were solid compositions, prcduced in accordance with the invention. Each composition was dissolved in 400 ml of water and than a 40 ml aliquot of the resulting solution was used for spraying at the rates indicated in Table IV. Approximately 28 days after the spraying, the degree of weed control was rated and recorded as a percentage control compared to the control exhibited on the same species of the same age which had not been sprayed. The rating ranged from 0 to 100 , where 0 equaled no effect on plant growth when compared to the untreated control, and 100 equals complete killing of the test weeds. The results are listed in Table IV. TABLE IV Percent Cbntrol Ratings Weight Rate Johnson Bermuda Purple Cmposition in grams 1b A grass grass Nutsedge 1.

It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that compositions exhibiting lower phytoactivity will require a higher application rate than the more active compounds for the same degree of effectiveness.
