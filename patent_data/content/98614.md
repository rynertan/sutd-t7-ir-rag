# ROTARY ASSEMBLY AND FLOATING SEAL THEREFOR

## Abstract
A rotary assembly has a toroidal cylinder and a toroidal piston disposed therein. A radially floating seal is provided between the piston and the cylinder so that when force from pressure within the cylinder is exerted against the end of the piston and the toroidal piston segment flexes into a more straightened configuration, the seal shifts laterally to maintain the pressure with the cylinder. In one embodiment the assembly is a bidirectional rotary driver. In another em bodiment the assembly serves to absorb rotational shock and vibration forces.
