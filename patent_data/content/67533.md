## Description
Process of spray micro encapsulation and comnosition for use therein The present invention is concerned with a process of spray micro encapsulation of materials such as fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and the like, in which the material to be encapsulated and a filmforming polymer are sprayed together into the atmosphere in such a way that the polymer coacervates and encapsulates the above mentioned material while they are still in the form of a spray. Such a process is frequently referred to herein a in flight encapsulation . Micro encapsulation is a well known technique.For example, U.S. Patents 3,242,051, 3,265,629, 3,575,882, and 3,607,776 all relate to processes dependent upon phase separation and polycondensation reactions. Specifically, U.S. Patent 3,242,051 relates to preparing a solution of a liquid phase forming micromolecular polymer in a first non aqueous liquid, dis persing in said solution a Plurality of individual discrete particles, adding a second liquid soluble iIl the first liquid, but not soluble with regard to said micromolecular polymer, ereby phase separation is induced and the dispersed particles are precoated, settling the polymer rich prcoat, separating the precoated particles, suspending the precoated particles in an aqueous solution of a gel, and using phase separation so no to cause the formation of a colloidal cnriched phase and the encapsulation of each of these suspended precoated particles, and cooling. U.S. Patent 3,265,629 is similar but relates to the application of two coatings to the particles, namely a solid lipid and a polymer. U.S. Patent 2,648,609 relates to an air suspension technique wherein a sugar solution is sprayed on to a suspended item such as candy, gum, etc.Another known technique involves charging a first solution with ions so that the solution exhibits a specific charge, applying an opposite charge to a second solution, and then coating the first solution with the second solution via air flow. U.S. Patent 3,202,533 relates to the encapsulation of liquids by the use of a fluidized bed wherein the fluidized liquid is frozen and spray coated. All the above processes employ multiple compounds or compositions of matter and require processing the encapsulated or micro encapsulated article prior to usage or application. Moreover, costly and complex processing equipment as well as difficult technology ia required to produce articles of a defined size and to meet mandatory environmental controls or regulations. Compounds such as PRO TEC , manufactured by Agro K Corporation, are intended to form a semipermeable membrane which may spread over leaf surfaces because of its good surfactant properties these membrane chemicals which do not form micro capsules are difficult to apply, as are membrane materials described in U.S. Patents 2,972,545 3,015,128 3,681,089 3,681,248 3,932,602 and 3,939,099. According to the present invention there. is provided a composition and process for the in flight encapsulation of particles and other materials. The composition comprises generally a film forming polymer in a liquid medium1 and any desired particles which may be soluble or dispersed in the liquid medium. Upon ejection from a spray apparatus and during flight through the atmosphere, the liquid medium evaporates with coacervation occurring and resulting in the formation of a polymer membrane about the material to be encapsulated. According to a first aspect of the invention, therefore, there is provided a spray micro encapsulation process, which comprises spraying into the atmosphere a composition comprising 35 to 99 by weight of a liquid, 0.1 to 25 by weight of a film forming polymer which is insoluble in said liquid and dispersed therein, and not more than 40 by weight of material to be encapsulated which is dissolved or dispersed in said liquid, so as to cause said liquid to evaporate and the polymer to coacervate and encapsulate said material while the composition is still in the form of a spray. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition further contains 1 to 40 of a core agent which is insoluble in the film forming polymer, the core agent being such as to control release of the encapsulated material from the resulting microcapsules for example by adding bulk to the core, contrblling the volatility or solubility of the encapsulated material . According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a spray micro encapsulation process, wch comprises spraying into the atmosphere a composition comprising 35 to 99 by weight of a liquid, 0.1 to 25 by weight of a film forming polymer which is dissolved in said liquid, not more than 40 by weight of material to be encapsulated which is dissolved or dispersed in said liquid and 1 to 40 of a core agent as just described, so as to cause said liquid to coacervate and encapsulate said material while the composition is still in the form of a spray. The present invention further comprises a composition as defined above with reference to the first and second aspects of the invention. The composition may contain in addition to the film forming polymer, a film modifying polymer which modifiers the stability and release characteristics of the encapsulating wall. Such a film modifying polymer may be used instead of or in addition to the core agent as described above in a composition according to the invention. The resulting encapsulated particles are generally of uniform size and have an outer polymer membrane surrounding a core. Because of the uniform size, the process can have good target specificity for application to, for example, an agricultural or forested area. Release of the encapsulated material can be controlled so as to take place over days to months rather than minutes or hours this control can be achieved by the presence of cross lining agents, core agents, or adhesive or film modifying polymers, as described above. BRIEF DESCRPTION OF DRAWINGS di. 1 is a photograph of an encapsulated particle, according to the present invention, wherein a polymeric film is shown about the particle and the film is adhered to a glass strand Fig. 2 is a photograph similar to Fig. 1 wherein the encapsulated particles adhered to the junction of two glass strands Fig. 3 is another photograph shoving a particle polymerically encapsulated about a glass strand and ig. 4 is another photograph showing an encapsulated particle attached to the intersection of to glass strands. FOR CARRYNG OUT THE INVENTION The concepts of the present invention relate to a composition and process with regard to the in ilight encapsulation of particles. Numerous applications exist through conventional ejection equipment such as conventional spraying apparatus to apply encapsulated particles for various utilities, for example, public health protection, agricultural applications, and any other rsa or iald in which the encapsulation of particles specially micro encapsulation, is desired. Ry the term 11in flight encapsulation it it is meant that the particle is covered, surrounded, coated, or encapsula ted by a film forming polymer by a coacervation process during or between the passage from an ejector or a spraying apparatus to a desired earth Biota target, material, area, plant, or the like. That is, the particle is encapsulated into the earth s atmosphere and not in a spray apparatus tank, or the like, and is directly applied to a plant, forest, soil, building, etc.As such, the film is created in situ during flight as the solvent or carrier liquid of the colloidal dis persion or the emulsion dispersion system evaporates. Moreover, the encapsulated material of the present invention results in a controlled release of the parti cle through a leaching mechanism so that in effect a site release of the particle is achieved from a matter of a day or two to several weeks or months. The film forming polymer is a component with in the polymer solvent system. Depending upon the molecular weight of the film forming polymer, the polymer solvent system may be a solution, a colloidal disper sion, or an emulsion dispersion. When the molecular weight of the film forming polymer is too large for the polymer to be solubilized, a colloidal dispersion having increased viscosity is created. When the fil forming polymer has a molecular weight which is too large for a colloidal dispersion to be formed, the polymer agglomerates, creating an emulsion dispersion having a viscosity virtually identical to that of the solvent.Hence, the polymer solvent system is either a macroscopially homogeneous, microscopically homogene ous solution or a macroscopically homogenous, micro scopically heterogeneous dispersion. The self encapsulating polymer containing solution comprises a film forming polymer in a solvent in which the polymer is soluble, and the particle itself. Therefore, the polymer containing solution exists as a particle either dissolved or dispersed in the solvent polymer phase. At times, a three phase dispersion system can be used in which the carrier liquid constitutes the third phase.On a weight basis, for either a solution or a dispersion system, the total amount of polymer utilized based upon the total weight of the solution, formulation, etc., by total weight of the solution or formula, it is meant the total weight of all of the compound which makes up the self encapsulating solution, dispersion, or formulation, including the particle, the core agent, the film forming polymer, the liquid or solvent, and the like, ranges from about 0.1 percent to about 25 percent, with from about 2 to about 18 percent being desirable, and from 4 to 13 percent being preferred. Often times, instead of a single film forming polymer, two or even three types of polymers including polymer dispersions can be utilized.As described below, the plurality of polymers may combine to unexpectedly control core system solubility in the wall system and the release characteristics therethrough.The amount of solvent ranges from about 35 percent to about 99 percent with from about 50 to about 90 being preferred. The amount of particle ranges from about 1 percent to about 40 percent with from about 5 to about 30 percent being preferred. Naturally, as will be bet ter understood by referring to the examples in the specification, the various components or compounds can be varied to achieve specific changes in properties of the final product that is, the encapsulated particle.Additionally, various adhesive agents, crosslinking agents, emulsifying agents, core agents, film modifying polymers, and other additives may be added to further modify either the process or th.e end product proper ties. Suitable polymers for use in the present invention relate to film forming polymers which are capable of encapsulating kthe particle by coacervation and which form a polymeric film about the particle. Such a specific polymer is polyvinyl acetate having a weight average molecular weight range of from about 10,000 to about 100,000. Another suitable and desired polymer is selected from polyvinyl ethers wherein the repeating hydrocarbon group is an alkyl having from 2 .to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 2 carbon atoms, and with the polymer having a weight average molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 100,000. The polyvinyl ether and the polyvinyl acetate polymers dissolve in the solvent and characterize a solution with macro scopic and microscopic homogeneity. Desirable polymers of the present invention relate to carboxylated acrylic polymers and copolymers such as those made from monomers having the formulaEMI8.1 where R4 is a hydrogen radical or a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and R5 is a hydrogen radical or a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, both hydrocarbon groups selected from the class consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, and aral kyl. Desirably R4 is an alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and preferably is hydrogen. R5, desirably has from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and, preferably, either has 1 carbon atom or is hydrogen.By carboxylated, it is meant that a substantial number of the pendant groups of the polyacrylate contains carboxyl groups. More over, by copolyzers, it is meant that the polymer inay be made from 2 cr more monomers having the above formulatin. A preferred polymer is made from methacrylate monomers with a more preferred polymer being made from acrylic acid monomers. Generally, any colloidal or emulsion foriring polymer can be utilized in the present invention where a dispersion that is a colloidal or an emulsion dispersion, is desired. For example, various acrylic type polymers and interpolymers can be utilized. Other acrylic type polymers include the acrylic copolymer systems, acrylic based polymer systems, acrylic aqueous colloidal dispersion resins, acrylic aqueous emulsion dispersion resins, and the like. The molecular weight of the carboxylated acrylic polymers of the above formula, as well as the other acrylic type polymers generally determines the type of polymer solvent carrier system created. Generally, acrylic type polymers having a range from about 10,000 to about 400,000 solubilize into the solvents of this invention. Acrylic type polymers having a molecular weight range from about 400,000 to about 800,000 form a colloidal dispersion in the solvents of this invention. Acrylic type polymers having a molecular weight range from about 800,000 to about several million, 3 , 3 or 4 million, or greater form an emulsoidal dispersion in the solvents of this invention. Tile colloidal and emulsoidal dispersions of acrylic type polymers are desirable for forming stronger films in situ during flight. Then employed, these dis persion acrylic type polymers may comprise a lower concentration in thc encapsulation blend than the solu tions of acrylic polymers because the higher molecular weight material creates a stronger film when formed in situ, Acrylic type polymers or copolymers having molecular weights greater than 400,000 are commercially available from Rohm Haas Company under the trademarks Rhoplex and Acrysol, such as Rhoplex AC 64,Rhoplex AC 22, Rhoplex LC 45, Rhoplex LC 40, Acrysol A 1, Acrysol A 3, and Acrysol A 5.Acrysol WS 12 provided effective film forming as a colloidal dispersion. It has been found that film forming with dispersion polymers can also be effective at ambient temperatures. With any film forming polymer used.in the present invention either instead of or in addition to the core agent , polymers with poor or negligible filmforming properties can be added to the solution or dispersion to modify the properties of the wall system.Such polymers as polyvinyl alcohol and polystyrene, in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 z by weight, desirably from 0.1 to 5 by weight of the composition are suitable film modifying polymers which, when combined with the film forming polymers described above, unexpectedly alter the core system solubility in the wall system, or control release characteristics of the wall system for the core system to release therethrough. A preferred polymer for use in the present invention is a salt of an interpolymer of alpha beta olefinically unsaturated carbonyl monomers which contain N methylol acrylic amides as set forth in U.S. Patent 3,007,887. Generally, the interpolymer has the following structure EMI11.1 where R and R1 are members of the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl R2 is a member of the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl R3 is a memr ber of the group consisting of methyl and ethyl n represents from 3 to 12 weight percent based cn the com bined weight of n, x, y and z x represents from 8 to 25 weight percent based on the combined weight cf n, x, y and z y represents from 45 to 89 weight percent based on the combined weight of n, x, y and z z represents from 0 to 44 weight percent based on the combined weight of n, x, y and z the sum of the numerical value of n x y z is always exactly 100 and the groups n, x, y and z are present in a heterogeneous relative position.The interpolymer is converted from an alcohol solution to water solutions by the addition of water having neutralizing agents such as ammonia, a hydrazine, or a lç boiling anise to the alcoholic solution of the interpolymer followed by an azeotropic distillation which removes the last traces of the alcohol and the excess neutralizing agent. The final aqueous solution of the polymer salt is preferably In the range of pH 5 8 and more preferably in the range of pH 6 7 with a total solids content of from about 2 to 40 percent by weight and preferably fron about 5 to about 30 percent by weight of polymer in water. The interpolymers embodied in this invention are those compositions comprising from 45 to 89 parts by weight of a lower methacrylic acid ester, from 0 t 44 parts by weight of a lower methacrylic acid ester from 3 to 12 parts by weight of an alpha beta olefin ically unsaturated carboxylic acid having a terminal Cry,2 5 C group and having from 3 to 4 carbon atoms and from 8 to 25 parts by weight of an N methylol alpha beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid amide having a terminal CR2 C group and having from 4 to 5 carbon atoms. The lower acrylic acid esters useful in this invention include those in which R2 in the above formula is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate and secondary butyl acrylate. The most preferred lother acrylic acid esters are methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate. The lower acrylate acid esters are useful in the range of from about 45 to about 89 weight percent based on the weight of the other monomers. The lower methacrylic acid esters useful in this invention include those in which R3 in the above formula is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from I to 2 carbon atoms such as methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate. The preferred methacrylic acid ester is methyl methacrylate. The lower methacrylic acid esters are useful in the range of from about 0 to about 44 weight percent based on the weight of the other monomers. The alpha beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids embodied in this invention include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. The alpha beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids are useful in the range of from about 3 to about 12 weight percent based on th.e weight of the other monomers. The N methylol acrylic amides present in the polymer may be, for example, N methylol acrylamide orN methylol methacrylamide N methylol acrylamide is most preferred. The N methylol acrylic amides are preferred in the range of from 8 to 25 based on the weight of the other monomers The weight average molecular weight of the above polymer is generally from 20,000 to 1,000,000, preferably 30,000 to 250,000. In In the molecular weight range between 300,000 and 500,000, the polymer forms a colloidal dispersion in the liquid vehicles in the molecular weight range greater than about 500,000 to about 2 or 3 million, the interpolymer structure forms an emulsoidal dispersion. Specific examples of the above interpolymers include Vinol 205, 523 or 540 87 hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol of molecular weight 22,000, 77,000 and 106,000, respectively . Carboset XLl1 molecular weight of about 45,000 , Carboset 514 molecular weight of about 30,000 , Carboset 515 molecular weight of about 7,000 , Carboset 525 molecular weight of about 260,000 , Carboset 526 molecular weight of 300,000 , all manufactured by The B. F. Goodrich Company. When such polymers are in solution in the liquid vehicle, a core agent and or a film modifying polymer is present. Some of the above polymers are eventually both in the wall and in the core and change the properties of the core wall interface. Carboset 515 is particularly valuable in providing a gel type core which stabilizes and limits the release of active agents. Vinol 205, 523 and 540 act as emulsifying agents for core materials not soluble in water and in addition position in the core and wall to change the properties, particularly the solubility of the core material in the wall. Carboset 515 and Vinol 205 are specifically valuable in dispersion and stabilization of protein type insecticide3 such as Bacillus Thuringiensus. Carboset 525 and 514 are specifically valuable in increasing the wall forming properties of the high molecular weight dispersion polymers. The liquid vehicle may be any liquid which will solubilize or colloidally or emulsoidally disperse the above polymers. Generally, water and alkanols having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms1 and combinations thereof, may be used. Examples of specific alcohols include methanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol and pentanol ethanol is preferred. Other suitable liquids include acetone1 dilsobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dioxane, and methylene chloride, Moreover, other solvents may be used in which the particle is generally soluble or dispersible therein.In the dispersion system, all of the above examples are possible with methanol and water being desirable carrier liquids. Water is the preferred dispersing liquid for colioidal and emulsion dispersion polymer systems. The particle can be a solid. However, in most instances, the particle is a liquid. Regardless of whether the particle is a solid or a liquid, it can be any compound which, as part of the self encapsulating solution or mixture, can be ejected or sprayed by either known or conventional electing or spraying apparatus.Although the particles may be of any size so long as they can be sprayed or ejected by an apparatus, they are desirably small to facilitate in the ease of ejecting or spraying the solution or, generally, due to their nature of application. For example, at least 90 percent of the particles having a size ranging from less than 1 micron to 300 microns may be utilized, generally, they are from a much smaller range as from about 1 to about 150 microns. For insecticides, odorants, etc., the application. of particles smaller than 100 microns, as from 1 to 50 microns, are often preferred. The smaller particle sizes permit a thinner wall construction formed by the polymer in situ during flight. Therefore, the concentration of the film t ormm trig polymer may be reduced in the overall encapsulation recipe.However, the higher sol secular weight polymers, which are colloidally or emulsoidally dispersed in the solvent, at concentrations of 0.01 percent may form strong films for particles having a size less than 100 microns Naturally, it is desirable that the particle, the solvent, or carrier liquid, and the polyiner s be compatible with each other in that they lack chemical interaction The particle compounds include nutrients such as fertilizers or vital trace minerals, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, molluscicides, herbicides, fungicides, pheromones, odorants, fragrances, attractaunts, repellents, and innocuous materials for scientific effort, keyed to spray equipment design, spray effects depending upon environmental influences, and the like, or other materials where rapid and controlled delivery to a given target is desired. Specific examples of these classes of particles are set forth below.

The pheromones may be of a volatile nature. The self encapsulating polymer containing solution of the present invention is applied by ejecting or spraying a liquid solution, colloidal dispersion or emulsion dispersion from known or conventional spray equipment. Such spray equipment can be affixed to anv suitable vehicle such as an aircraft, truck, a spray system in a field, and the like, utilizing techniques and artifices common to the particular art, for example, as in the agricultural and public health areas. Subsequently and immediately after ejection, the spray during flight through the intervening atmosphere rapidly loses solvent via. evaporation, coacervation occurs, and small solid spheres are formed having generally a very uniform shape and size.Thus, in flight encapsulation occurs during the short passage between the egress of a spray of ejection apparatus and a target area with the delivered encapsulated product being a solid. Each sphere or microcapsule is comprised of an outer enveloping polymeric membrane or wall system and an inner core of the particle or an agglomeration of particles or core system The encapsulated product can be delivered to and within the target area using narrow spectrum sprays for example, that produced by the Beeco Mist Nozzle, designed to provide a sufficient transport of the active ingredient to its target area .Generally, the various spray systems can be adjusted such that a few ounces of the composition or solution is utilized for each acre or up to about 2 to 5 gallons of solution per acre. In the latter case, water is generally utilized as 2 solvent. Moreover, applicants composition, solution and process, aided by the film forning polymer coating of a particle or particles, can result in fairly uni form sized encapsulated products, that is, encapsulated products in which at least 90 percent of the products fall within a n2rra.z range, and as set forth hereinabove. Of course, the size of the encapsulate products can be varied by changing the proportion of the various ingredients, the amount of crosslinking agent, core agent and the like, as set forth hereinbelow as well as utilizing different spray equipment, particularly the nozzles thereon which largely determine the initial egress droplet size spectrum. Thus, encapsulated products having a particle size of from 1 micron to 500 microns or larger can be produced.Generally, however, encapsulated products of from 1 to about 150 microns are desired for many applications. A specific example of a suitable spraying apparatus which delivers droplets over a narrow range Is manufactured by the Beeco Products Corporation. As a rough rule of thumb, the encapsulated particle size will be 80 percent of the initial droplet size leaving a spray or ejecting apparatus, when the amount of solvent is equal to the amount of particles on a weight basis. Since great uniformity and droplet size as well as the encapsulated product can be controlled as described herein, the microcapsules of the present invention are ideal as a research tool for the study and evaluation of spray equipment and effects of atmospheric parameters upon the spraying art. Additionally, micro encapsulated products of the present invention result in a controlled leaching rate of the particular particle at the site of application or target area so that the particle availability is greatly prolonged and leads to greater efficacy, reduced contamination, and economic benefit. Also, non persis ent agents can be encapsulated and essentially rendered persistent at the excrocapsule application site, so that once released in the environment, it becomes subject to natural degradation factors so that persistency is low at the site of application again a positive contribution to enhance environmental quality. In addition to varying the components of the system, additional compounds or agents may be added to the solution to control various parameters or functions such as capsule size, the enveloping polymeric membrane thickness, the leaching rate, the rate of evaporation, the emitted droplet size, adhesion, particle bu k particle volatility, and particle solubility and tha like. Naturally, such additives should not have any deleterious chemical interaction with any of the components of the system. In those circumstances where the particle is an active ingredient requiring minute concentrations over large surface areas, additional core agents insoluble in the film forming polymer may add bulk to the material within the core inside the film wall. Otherwise, the minute concentration of particle may become trapped within the polymer film wall, causing uncontrolled release, whenever a particle is particularly volatile, controlled release is necessary to provide effective and efficient use e of the particle in the environment. Pheromones are particularly volatile, and a core agent controls its release. Whenever a particle has a degree of solubility with the fil forming polymer, a core agent may become necessary to decrease the particle solubility in the polymer. This addition of a core agent is particularly effective for particles which are either solubilized in solvents, miscible with the film forming polymer, or may be slightly soluble in the polymer. Nethyl para thion and m diethyltoluamide DEET are effectively re strained within the core of the encapsulation with the addition of a core agent. The mechanisr.s of coacervation, encapsulation, and controlled release are enhanced by a separation of the in situ product into a film forming polymer wall and a particle liquid o solid ccre. This separation is enhanced greatly by the use of core agents. Further, a core agent may serve to prevent degradation of the agent or encapsulant from ultra violet radiation. Core agents are selected from any of the following groups of compounds 1. Monohydric alcohols having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms and the mono and polyunsaturated deriva tives thereof e.g., octyl alcohol, decyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, etc. 2. Polyhydric alcohols having from 2 10 carbon atoms and the monoesters thereof, diesters there of, testers thereof, monoethers thereof homopolymers thereof, and the homopolymer monoethers thereof e.g., glycol and polyglycol monoethers, polypropylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc.EMI21.1 3. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having from 8 20 carbon atoms and the alkyl esters thereof e.g., monoglycerides, diglycerides trigly cerides gtyterine , 4, Absorbant or porous solids including car bon black, silica, and molecular sieves, and combinations thereof 5. Sunscreen materials and 6. Soy oil. Of the core agents, desirable compounds are the polyhydric alcohols and the fatty acids. Preferably, the di and trimesters of the polykydric alcohols and especially the triglycerides serve as effective core agents. The core agent may be added to the solution or dispersion at a range from about 1 to about 40 percent. by weight, and desirably at a range from 2 to about 25 percent by weight of the total weight of the solution or formulation. The preferred range is from 3 to 5 percent. Generally, the enveloping polymer membrane of the polymers of the present invention are degraded in the environment. The effects of the rain and sun can be detrimental to the longevity of the particle and the active ingredients in the core. However, longevity can be enhanced in several ways as by increasing the amount or thickness of the enveloping polymer membrane.This can be achieved by utilizing a greater ratio of polymer. Moreover, longevity can be increased by utilizing specific types of polymers such as various specific interpolymers which show improved leaching rates over similar polymers. Crosslinking agents may also be added to the solution so that, upon encapsulation, the polymeric membrane is crosslinked. Cross linking decreases the pore size and, hence, increases duration or longevity so that the final particle may be utilized over a period of several months. Suitable crosslinking agents include urea, and other triaminçs, diamines, triamides and diamides, as well as the alka line earth metal salts wherein tne alkaline earth is beryllium, magnesium, barium or, preferably, calcium.Suitable amnions include carbonate, bicarbonate, nitrate, oxide, hydroxide, and the various halogens, for example, F Cl, I , and Br . Of these, the calcium salts, especially calcium hydroxide, are desirable and calcium chloride is preferred. Moreover, the interpolymers may be crosslinked with zinc oxide as taught in U. S. PatentNo. 3,749,772. Generally, the extent of the crosslinking agent may range from about 0.01 to about 0.5 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the solution with the range of from about 0.05 to about 0.25 being preferred. Naturally, the crosslinking agents should be non toxic, generally, non reactive with the components, and soluble in the solvents of the present invention. Other modifications to the wall system which arfects longevity of the wall include the addition of film modifying polymers described above. These secondary polymers may be joined by other emulsion or dispersion materials to control wall thickness and pore size. Additionally, sunscreen materials which have been itemized as core agents may also be added to the wall system for encapsulant longevity. The self encapsulating polymer containing solution of the present invention, Generally, must be rtiaintained in relatively a non acidic state, usually at a pM of 6.5, and preferably 7.0, to 8.0, to prevent crosslinking prior to solvent evaporation. Typical alkaline agents may be utilized to achieve such a pH range, such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide, and the like.Normally, only very small amounts are required as on the range of 0.01 to about 50 percent by weight of the total solution or mixture. In many applications, especially those involving the delivery of insecticides to protect crops and the like, .long term adhesion of the microcapsule to foliage or other plant structures is desired. The amount by weight of adhesive agent ranges from about 0.1 to about 10 percent, and desirably from about 0.1 to 3 percent, based upon the total weight of the solutionImproved adhesion can be obtained by generally utilizing the lower molecular weight interpolymers and or adhesive agents such as alkyl esters. The alkyl esters are of the formulaEMI24.1 where R6 and R7 contain from 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Ethyl acetate is the preferred alkyl ester. Generally, any conventional adhesive agent which improves adhesion of the encapsulated particle to the plant, etc. that is, the earth target, biota, etc., can be utilized.Thus, the diesters of phthalic acid, e.g., di octylphthalate can be used. Other compounds which serve as adhesive agents include wall softening agents such as some of the film modifying polymers, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol. The effect of the various ingredients upon the meirbrane thickness, adhesion, longevity of release and the like will be better understood by reference toTable I which sets forth formulations in Examples 1 through 12. In Example 1, the interpolymer utilized was 16 percent or z high molecular type such as Carboy set 525, 50 percent by weight of alcohol, and 34 percent by weight of the particle. In Example 1, the particle was actually in solution as a 50 50 mixture of benzoic acid and ortho toluic acid.This example, as well as the other examples were sprayed through a beech Mist spray gun utilizing a 60 micron pore size nozzle. The polymer film totally encapsulated the crystallized acids used as a particle and the encapsulated product were spheres. Example 2 illustrates a crosslinked version of Example 1 wherein calcium chloride was used as a crosslinking agent along with a small amount of ammonia to prevent premature crosslinking prior to solvent evaporation. The thickness of the polymer membrane or wall system was greater than that of Example 1.Decreasing the average molecular weight of the polymer component as in Example 3 decreases the membrane or wall thickness and, thus, lowers the field life of the capsule. For long life, that is from about 3 to 6 months, the polymer of Example 4 may be crosslinked as shown in Example 5. As previously noted, the use of low molecular weight polymers provide some degree of tackiness so that the encapsulated product will adhere to leaves, stems, and the like. However, since lower molecular weight polymers are often deleterious to film forming properties, increased adhesion time of several weeks and even several months can be obtained by adding small amounts of ethyl acetate or butyl cellosolve, as set forth in the formulation of Example 6. The process of adhesion promotion is as follows.Utilizing the formulation of Example 7, the microcapsule forms and cross linking occurs, and as soon as the alcohol and ammonia evaporate, the process progressing in a few seconds after the egress from a spraying apparatus, depending upon the droplet surface area and volatility of the solvent. However, the ethyl acetate or butyl cellosolve is occluded by the forming envelope and, thus, for the most part, is present at the time of foliage contact, At the instant of such contact and for several seconds thereafter, the ethyl acetate moves from the microcapsule, penetrating the outermost dermis of the plant. This process, mainly a desorption phenomenon, results in a slight flow of the polymer envelope into the foliage structure, thus enhancing adhesion. The process is rapid and relies on a quantity of an adhesive aid, such as ethyl acetate, Moreover, no damage to agricultural important plants arises from momentary contact with the ethyl acetate. Water systems and water alcohol systems have also been utilized as where the uses of a diluted alcohol would be advantageous. Examples 8 and 9 il lustrate such systems, based upon a water soluble interpolymer, particularly, Carboset XLII. In Example 8, a water system is utilized and, hence, the particles are limited to water soluble and dispersible compounds.Although this formulation is of poor environmental resistance, it is used in delivering trace nutrients such as water soluble zinc, copper, iron, and other salts. The formulations of Examples 8 and 9 result in capsule formation during flight, but due to the amount of H20 present at the time of impact, the effects may be a soft capsule that flows to meet the contour of the Impingement surface. Rigid spheres are usually not formed. Such systems may also be crosslinked and adhesion promoted. In contrast, the porosity of a microcapsule may be enhanced by the utilization of an alcohol insoluble with a water soluble additive such as calcium benzoate, calcium hydroxide, and calcium carbonate.Considering Example 10, during in flight encapsulation, most of the calcium chloride is trapped within a polymer membrane However, once the crosslinked capsule has adhered to a given surface and comes into contact with water, the porosigen, calcium benzoate, is rapidly lost through leaching and a pore structure remains allowing water penetration of the core particle. The calcium hydroxide is used as inExample 11 It not only serves to crosslink the polymer but also imparts alkalinity and, thus, no ammonia is necessary. Since calcium hydroxide is alcohol soluble, a considerable fraction is found in the core area. However, suffi.cient quantities exist within the polymer envelope to enhance th.e growth of porosity.

The solution was mixed and added to a manual spray ejector such as a hand operated atomizing pump.The solution was sprayed in the direction of glass fibers located approximately 1 to 2 feet away from the egress of the spray pump. Upon spraying, the Carboset encapsulated the pyrethrin piperonyl butoxide. The gr.aphic analysis, as shown in photographs 1 through 4, clearly depicts the polymeric film formed about the pyrethrin piperonyl butoxide particle. The glass strands in all photographs are 10 microns in diameter. As apparent from the photographs,Fig. 1 definitely shows a polymer formed about the particle, with the polymer adhered to a glass strand. In Fig. 2, the polymer is formed about the intersection of two strands with another encapsulated particle located about a single strand. Fig. 3 discloses the encapsulated film being located about the liquid particle. In this photograph, the film actually formed completely about a portion of a glass strand. Fig. 4 is similar toFig. 2 in that it reveals a polymeric film formed about the intersection of two glass strands with a liquid particle being located therein. EKAbIPLE B Thirty parts by weight of Carboset XLll having a molecular weight of approximately 45,000 in a 30 percent aqueous dispersion was mixed with 100 parts of water. To this was added 120 parts of Dursban containing 75 percent of an active ingredient of O,O diethyl 0 3, 5,6 trichloropyridinylthionophosphate. These ingredients were mixed and the solution had a pH of 6.7.Utilizing a hand spray pump, the solution was sprayed towards a target area. Photographs reveal that the active ingredient was fully encapsulated by the particle. Use of acrylic polymers in a dispersion system is explained by referring to Examples C, D, andE. EXAMPLE C The following acrylic dispersions were tested for their potentials in the encapsulation of particles, these polymer dispersions were products of the Rohm andHaas Co. CPhiladelphia . Soy oil was the particle. TABLE II Glass TransitionR. Dispersion tEFT C Temperature T C AC 64 5 9 13 SC 40 2 9 LC 45 2 10 LC 67 0 45 Minimum Film Formation Temperature The LC series of dispersions are characterized by softness and adhesion, with LC 67 being internally plasticized. The AC 64 is harder in comparison. Soybean oil 50 parts was emulsified withTween 80 1.5 parts and water 100 parts . The Rhoplex dispersions were made up to either 30 or 50 parts of polymer in 200 parts water. The two emulsions were mixed, diluted to spray volume 500 1,000 ml with water. The solutions were tested as follows the emulsion was sprayed through a Mini Ulva sprayer whoseDmax was in the range of 125 microns. The spray cloud was impinged after the flight process on 1 paper, 2 teflon coated slides, 32 glass slides 1 x 3 inch and on the target for use in the Scanning Electron Microscope. The effective nature of the encapsulated droplets were evaluated by their SEM results. In this series of tests the AC 64, LC 45 and LC 40 dispersions gave excellent microcapsules at 30 and 50 percent wall dispersion concentration. The LC 67 was tested only at 50 percent wall content and gave less desirable results relative to capsule form and stability. EXAMPLE D A suspension solution of the ammonium salt ofCarboset R 525 and Rhoplex R AC 64 was made by dissolving 5 parts of Carboset 525 ammonium salt in 100 parts water and adding 5 parts of 60 percent AC 64 dispersion.Ninety parts of soybean oil was emulsified with 3 parts of Tween 80 in 500 parts of water. The two emulsion suspension dispersion solutions were mixed and sprayed as in the previous example. Excellent microcapsules with approximately 10 percent wall were formed as proven by light microscope inspection and by SEM pictures. EXAMPLE E One hundred parts of N,N diethyl meta tolu ainide DEET repellent, were emulsified in 200 parts of water and added to 200 parts of water containing 40 parts of AC 64 60 percent active . Addition of 5 parts Automate Red dye to the emulsified core liquid allows simplified light microscopy evaluation. The eaulsion dispersion was fluted to 500 ml with water and sprayed as in tile previous examples. Excellent microcapsules of DEET were foimed which controlled the release of the DEET over a IQ 15 day period, when tested by spraying in a horse barn, On horses, flies, including horn. flies were repelled for 3 5 day periods. Use of various core agents is explained by referring to Examples F, G, and H. EXAMPLE F One hundred parts of N, N diethyl meta tolua mide DEET repellent were added to 10 parts of soybean oil in 200 parts acetone. The soybean oil acted as a core agent for solubility control in limiting the solubility of the DEET core liquid in Carboset 525 polymer and in controlling the volatility of the DEET.The DEET soybean oil core system was added to 300 parts acetone containing 20 parts of Carboset 525. The solution was sprayed out as in the previous example to give excellent microcapsules with adequate wall stability, and a well defined wall system core systems. In the absence of the core modifying agent, the Carboset 525 and the DEET are miscible. EXAMPLE G Glossyplure pink bollworm pheromone 2 grams parts were dissolved in 300 parts cotton seed oil containing 3. percent Eveen 80 as an emulsifier. Three hundred parts of Carboset 525 in 600 parts methanol and 3Q parts ammonium hydroxide was added to 1 gallon water. The core liquid was then added and the total emulsion volume made up to 2 gallons. A total of ten acres of irrigated cotton was sprayed at the rate of 2 gallons of the above mixture per acre. Pink bollworm mating was substantially totally interrupted for a period of 20 days as evidenced by the absence of trap catches of male moths in pheromone baited traps in the cotton field. The core modifier Ccottonseed oil acts to allow excellent microcapsule formation and to limit the volatility of the pheromone Cossyplere over the twenty day period. In laboratory type tests, oleyl alcohol, hexadecanol and decanol have been proven to be effective core modifiers, for various pheromones including Indian Meal Moth pheromone which remained actively emitted from microcapsules on foliage for periods up to 40 days, as measured by male activity towards air streams blown over microcapsules on leaves in a glass bioassay system. EXAMPLE H Rhoplex AC 64, 10 parts, was added to 100 parts water containing 5 parts of polystyrene dispersion. The polystyrene acted as a core wall modifier.Soybean oil 20 parts was emulsified in 100 parts water and added to the Rhoplex AC 64 polystyrene dispersion. The dispersion was diluted to 300 ml and sprayed as described previously. Stable micro capsules with well defined wall system core system cOrC charac teristics were formed. The Rhoplex emulsion dispersions act in the presence of core liquids which allow capsule wall formation. Dioctyl phthalate and DEET are examples ofRhoplex polymer emulsion modifiers which assist in wall formation.
