# Method for making polymethylated phenols.

## Abstract
A method is provided for making polymethylated phen ols, such as 2,3,5 trimethylphenol and 2,3,5,6 tetramethyl phenol from a mixture of isophorone and methanol. Catalytic demethanation of isophorone and methanation of the re sulting product is achieved by contacting the mixture of iso phorone and methanol with the calcination residue of a mixture of magnesium carbonate and or magnesium hy droxide and a manganese compound at elevated tempera tures.
