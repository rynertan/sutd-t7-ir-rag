# Lens meter and method of measurement of progressive multifocal lens using the same.

## Abstract
Lens meter and method of measurement of progressive multifocal lens using the same which is able to set the amount of movement of the lens and to simply position a far or near distance refraction characteristics measuring por tion of a progressive multifocal lens. In accordance with the method the optical center of a lens is first found from mea surement employing the lens and using the optical center as a point of origin, the lens is moved by a distance up to the far distance refraction characteristics measuring portion and the near distance refraction characteristics measuring portion of the lens mentioned by the lens manufacturer, so as to effect alignment with the measurement optical axis of the lens meter, thereby measuring the refraction character istics of each measuring portion.
