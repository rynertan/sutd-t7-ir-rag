## Description
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to detergent compositions eshi g improved greasy soil removal capabilities. More specifically the detergent compositions of this invention provide un lly good detergency performance on greasy and oily soils having a marked particulate soil content. Cationic surfactants have been frequently incorporated into detergent compositions of various types. However, the inclusion of such cationic surfactants is generally he urpose of providing some adjunct fabric care benefit, and not for the purpose of cleaning. For example, certain cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yiclding a germicidal or sanitization benefit to washed surfaces, as is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,742,434, opp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S. Patent 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issuedNovember 10, 1970 and U.S. Patent 3,965,026, Lancz, issued June 22, 1976.Other cattonic surfactants, such as ditallowdimethylammonium chloride, have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yielding a fabric softening benefit, as disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,607,763, Salmon et al, issued September 21, 1971 and U.S. Patent 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issued February 22, 1972. Such components are also disclosed as being included in detergent compositions for the purpose of controlling static, as well as softening laundered fabrics, in U.S. Patent 3,951,879,Wixon, issued April 20, 1976 and U.S. Patent 3,959,157,Inamorato, issued May 25, 1976. Compositions comprising mixtures of anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants are also known in the art. Thus, compositions conferring enhanced antistatic character to textiles washed therewith are described in B.P. 873,214 while compositions having enhanced germidical and detergency performance are disclosed in B.P. 641,297. Surprisingly, it has now been found, however, that built detergent compositions comprising water soluble or dispersible mixtures of specific anionic, cationic and non ionic surfactants in critical relative amounts provide unexpectedly improved cleaning performance on greasy and oily soils, even where these have a high content of particulate matter. Moreover, this excellent. performance is observed at both high and low wash temperatures and over a range of rcalistic soil types and wash conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced, greasy stain removal per4 ormance is achieved without detriment to dctergency performance on conventional soil and stain types and most surprisinyly, wit detriment to the soil suspending or fabric whitening characteristics of the compositions. Summary of the Invention, According to the present invention. there is provided a solid particulate detergent composition comprising a from 2 to 60 of a surfactant system consisting essentially of a water soluble or water dispersible combination of anionic, alkoxylated nonionic and water soluble quaternary anunonium cationic surfactants, wherein the anionic cationic surfactant weight ratio is no more than 5 1 and the nonionic cationic sur factant weight ratio is in the range from 100 1 to 2 3, and wherein the surfactant system contains anionic and cat ionic surfactants in an equivalent ratio of at least 1 1, and b at least 0 of a detergency builder. Detergent compositions of the present invention contain as an essential ingredient a three component active system comprising anionic, alkoxylated nonionic and water soluble cationic surfactants. This active system comprises from about 2 to about 60 by weight of the compositions. In granular laundry detergent applications, the active system is generally in the range from about 4 to about 30, more preferably from about 6 to about 15 by weight of the compositions. The compositions of the present invention are prefably formulated to have a pH of at least about 6 in the laundry solution at conventional usage concentrations about 1 by weight in order to optimize cleaning per formancc. pore preferably, tllcy are alkaline in nature when placed in the laundry solution and have a pli greater than about 7, especially greater than about 8. At the higher pH values, the surface activity of the compositions Q lie invention is enhanced and, in certain instances, cluite markedly enhanced. n preferred systems, the anionic and cationic surfactants have a combined total of no more than 34 carbon atoms counted in hydrophobic groups having at least 4 consecutive carbon atoms eg. alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl groups etc. . In more preferred systems the number of such hydrophobic group carbon atoms totals from about 18 to 33, especially from about 26 to 32, with the anionic surfactant providing at least 12 of the carbon atoms. These hydrophobicity limitations have been found to optimize the interaction of the ternary active system with greasy and oily stains on fabrics and to correspond to compositions of maximum grease detergency effectiveness. An essential feature of the present compositions is that the surfactant system must be substantially neutral in surfactant anions and cations or else have ionic excess of surfactant anions over surfactant cations. This is important not only with regard to optimizing grease removal, but also for ensuring good suspension of soil in the detergent wash liquor ie. preventing soil redeposition and also for ensuring at water insoluble anionic effect agents such as anionic luorescers retain their effectiveness in composition. t is, of course, well known, that anionic fluorescers quenched or inhibited in effectiveness in the presence of cationic surfactants. Surprisingly, the rease and oil detergency benefits o the present invention are secured without suppression of fluorescer activity It is accordingly highly important that the overall anionic cationic surfactant equivalent ratio in the present compositions is, within manufacturing erro , at least 1 1. At typical composition evels, the manufacturing pres in the anionic and cationic surfactant components s o about 5 by weight for each component. Subject to the above conditions e weight ratio of anionic cationic surfactant can vary in the range from about 5 1 to about 1 3, especially em about 2 1 to about 1 2, the weight ratio of nonionic cationic from about 300 1 to about 2 3, especially fromabout 20 1 to about.l l, and the weight ratio of anionic nonionic from about 7 1 to about 1 20, especially from about 2 1 to about 1 10. In terms of surfactant levels, the surfactant system preferably comprises at least about 5 by weight of the water soluble cationic surfactant and at least about 60 by weight in total of the anionic and nonionic surfactants.In one preferred embodiment, the surfactant system comprises at least 15 by weight of each of the anionic and cationic surfactants and from 15 to 60 by weight of the nonionic surfactant. In another preferred embodiment, the surfactant system comprises at least 5 by weight of each of the anionic and cationic surfactants. and at least 60 by weight of the nonionic surfactant. As mentioned above, the cationic surfactant component of the composition of the invention is characterised as being water soluble. By water solubility, we refer in this context to the solubility of cationic surfactant in monomeric form the limit of solubility being determined by the onset of micellisation and measured in terms of critical micclle concentration C.M.C. . The cationic surfactant should thus have a C.M.C. for the pure material greater than about 200 p.p.m. and preperably greater than about 500 p.p.m., specified at 30 C and in distilled water. Literature values are taken where possible, especially surface tension or conductimetric values seeCritical Micelle Concentrations of Aqueous Surfactant Systems,P. Mukerjee and K.J. Mysels, NSRDS NBS 36, 1971 . Another important features is that the ternary active system itself must be wafter dispersible or wa ter soluble in combination with the remainder of the detergent com position.This implies that, in an equilibrium aqueous mixture of the detergent composition containing about 1000 p.p.m. of surfactant the ternary active system exists in one or more liquid. as opposed to solid surfactant water phases. Expressed in another way, the surfactant syste sh ld have a point er than about A further essen ial component of the present compositions is at least 10 , preferably from about 20 to about. 70 by weight of a detergency builder, for example, a water soluble o ganic or organic electrolyte, Suitable electrolytes have fin equivalent weight of less than 210, especially less than 100 and Include the common alkaline polyvalent calcium ion sequestering agents.Water insoluble calcium ion exchange materials can also be used with advantage, however.Surprisingly, it is found that the grease removal performance of the present compositions depends sensitively oil the ionic strength and the level of free hardness ions iA the detergent liquor and these parameters must be closely controlled for optimum performance. Thus, when the compositions are used in about 1 solution, the builder surfactant weight ratio is preferably greates than about 1 3, more preferably greater than about 4 1 and especially greater t ian about 8 1. The weight ratio of calcium ion sequestering or exchange agent surfactant, on the other hand, is preferably greater than about 1 1 and especially greater than about 3 1, wilile the electrolyte surfactant weight ratio is preferably greater than about 3 1, especially greater than about 6 1. Optimum grease and particulate detergency also depends sensitively on the choice of nonionic surfactant and especially desirable from the viewpoint of grease detergency are biodegradable nonionic surfactants having a lower consolute temperature in the range from about 25 C to about 650C, more preferably from about 300C to about 50 C.Highly suitable nonionic surfactants of this type .have the general formula RO CH2CH2O nH wherein R is primary or secondary branched or unbranched C9 15 alkyl or alkenyl and n the average degree of ethoxylation is from 2 to 9, especially from 3 to 8. More hydrophilic nonionic detergents can be employed for providing particulate detergency and anti redeposition, however, for instancc, nonionic detergents of the general formula given above wherein R is primary or secondary, branched or unbranced C8 8 24 alkyl or alkenyl and n is from 10 to 40. Combina ions of the two classes of nonionic surfactants can also b used wit ourse. The i ivid compostion of the vention wit des detail. The Cationic Surfactant The cationic surfactant s a water soluble quaternary ammonium compound having a critical micelle concentration of at least 200 p.p.m. at 30 C. In structural terms, the preferred cationic surfactant comprises from 1 to about 4 quaternary ammonium groups of which only one has the general formula R1mR2x wherein each R1 is a hydropnobic alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substi uted or interrup ed by phenyl, ether, ester or amide groups totalling from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and which may additionally contain up to 20 ethoxy groups, m is a number from 1 to 3 and no more than one R1 can have more than , carbon atoms when m is 2 and no more than 12 carbon atoms when m is 3, each.R2 is an alkyl group containing from one to four carbon atom or a benzyl group wiLh no more than one in a molecule being benzyl, and x is from 0 to 3, A highly preferred group of cationic surfactants of this typo have the general formula 12 m 4 m wherein R1 is selected from C8 C20 alkyl, alkenyl and alkaryl groups R2 is selected from C1 4 alkyl and benzyl groups Z is an anion in number to give electrica neutrality and m is 1, 1 z or 3 provided that when m is 2, R1 has less than 15 ca on atoms and When m is 3, R1 has less than 9 carbon aroms.

Where m is equal to 3, the R1 chains should be less t an 9 carbon atoms in length. An example is trioctylmethyl ammonium chloride. The reason for this chain length restriction, as is also the case with the di long chain cationics described above, is the relative insolubility of these r and di long chain materials. Another group of useful cationic compounds are the polyammonium salts of the general formula EMI8.1 wherein R3 is selected from C8 to C20 alkyl, alkenyl and alkaryl groups each R4 is C1 C4 alkyl n is from 1 to 6 and m is from 1 to 3.

These surfactants, won used in the compositions of the present invention, yield excellent particulate soil, body soil, and grease and oil soil removal. In addition, the detergent compositions control static and soften the fabrics laundered therewith, and inhibit he transfer of dyes in the washing solution. Further, these novel cationic surfactants are environmentally desirable, since both their long chain alkyl segments and their nitregen segments are biodegradable.

In a precess aspect of the inver there is procided a method of making the detergent composit o i of the invention comprising the steps of spray drying a crutcher mix containing the anionic, cationic and buiThc1r cor ponents and subsequently absorbing the nonionic surfactant in liquid or molten form into the spray dried granules. This precess Is particularly valuble when the builder comprises an aluminosilicate ion exchange material. In another process aspect of particular applicability to compositions comprising aluminosilicate builder, the nonionic is included in the crutcher mix for spray drying, but the components of the surfactants are premixed before addition of the aluminosilicate. Other processes of making the compositions of the invention can be employed, of course. Thus the anionic and nonionic surfactants and the builder and filler components can be spray dried in conventional manner to form a base powder composition and the cat ionic component can then be added to the base powder either as an approximately 1 1 mixture with part of the builder or filler components retained for that purpose, or as an inclusion complex of, for instance, urea. Alternatively, the cationic surfactant can be sprayed onto the base powder, or added as a dry mixed prill agglo meratedwith an inorganic or organic agglomerating aid, or can be separately spray dried and added to the base powder as a dry mixed granule.Alternatively, the cationic sur factant and base powder compositions can be individually spray dried in separate stages of a multi stage spray drying tower. The compositions of the invention can also be provided in the form of two or more component products, which are either mixed before use or added separately y to a laundry solution to provide a concentration of the ternary surfactant system of from about 100 to about 3000 p.p.m., especially from about 500 to about 1500 p.p.m. lach component product includes one or more of the active ingredients of tic ternary surfactant system and a mixture of the products in prescribed amotonts should have the requisite granular form. In a preferred embodiment, one product i.s formulated as a conventional anionic or nonionic detergent composition suitable for use in the main with cycle of an autoontic laundry or washing machine, and the other is formulated as a cationic containing additi or booster product for use simultaneously with the conventional detergent during the nlain wash. In addition to the cationic, the additive product will contain nonionic and or anionic surfactant such that the total composition formed by mixing the component products in specified amounts has the requisite ternary active system. . The compositions of the invention can also be formulated as special prewash compositions designed for used hefore the main. wash stage of the conventional laundering cycle. Such prewash composition will normally consist of a single product component containing the defined ternary active system.
