# Combination seismic cable.

## Abstract
I provide a combination land bay cable 10 capable for simultaneous use on land 12 and in water covered areas 14. When the cable section 10 is placed in a water covered area 14 suitable for hydrophone use 22, a polarized plug 62 containing an impedance matching transformer 35 is detach ably connected to a polarized socket 38. The transformer 35 connects the hydrophones 22 to a transmission line 48. If the cable 10 is to be used on land 12, the transformer 35 is unplugged deactivating the hydrophones 22 and at least one geophone 24 having a substantially identical plug 68 is inserted in the socket 38. The plug 68 connects the geophone 24 to the transmission line 48 and leaves the hydrophones 22 inactive.
