# A control device for a pneumatically driven demand pump.

## Abstract
A control device associated with a pneumatically driven demand pump comprising a valve system which shuts off the gas which drives the pneumatic pump in response to a pressure sensitive diaphragm which detects variations in pressure in the fluid output from the pump. The pressure sensitive diaphragm serves the dual function of suppressing surges of liquid flow from the pump and stopping the pump when the liquid pressure drops below a predetermined minimum by closing a valve to shut off the gas.
