# A FACTOR AND ITS PROCESSING SIGNALS

## Abstract
Novel DNA constructs are provided for efficient expres sion of polypeptides by yeasts. The constructs employ yeast a factor secretion leader and processing signals joined to a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest in reading frame with the a factor signals. The constructions provide for the expression, secretion and maturation of the desired polypeptide. A strategy is provided for the isolation of the a factor secretion leader and processing signals and the join ing, by means of a relatively short adaptor, molecules of the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide to the processing signals in proper reading frame. The bacterial cell strain E. coli HB101 pAB163 was de posited at the A.T.C.C. on April 20, 1983 and given Accession No. 39342.
