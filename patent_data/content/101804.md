# Differential mass flow meter.

## Abstract
A flowmeter is provided for receiving a plurality of fluid streams and providing signals representative of the mass flow rate of each stream and the differential mass flow rate of any selected pair of the streams. A housing 12 defines a flow channel to accomodate each stream to be measured. An impeller 52, 106 is rotatably mounted in each channel to impart measured angular momentum to the fluid flowing in that channel and all of the impellers 52, 106 are driven by a common turbine 34 and shaft 40 . The impellers 52, 106 are each resiliently coupled to the shaft 40 so that the impellers lag behind the shaft by an amount proportional to the angular momentum imparted by each impeller to the fluid in its respective channel. Pick off means B, D associ ated with each impeller 52, 106 produce lag signals representative of the impeller lag angle and the lag signals are applied to a signal processor 200, 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212 that produces individual mass flow rate signals and differential mass flow rate signals representative of the difference in mass flow rate of any two selected fluid streams.
