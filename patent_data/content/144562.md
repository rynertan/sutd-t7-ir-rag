# Method of an apparatus for chopping runners and sprues.

## Abstract
A runner structure A composed of a runner a and a sprue b is discharged from an injection molding machine into a chopping apparatus 10 having a first cutter mechan ism 12 and a second cutter mechanism 13 . The runner structure A is guided by a guide mechanism 11 in the chopping apparatus 10 toward the first and second cutter mechanisms 12, 13 . The sprue b is cut off from the runner a by the first cutter mechanism 12 , and then the runner a and the sprue b are chopped by the second cutter mechanism 12 . The first cutter mechanism 12 has a lower cutter 31 for stopping the runner structure A by engage ment with the sprue b , and an upper cutter 32 movable into coaction with the lower cutter 31 for cutting off the sprue b . The second cutter mechanism 13 includes a feed roller 50 for feeding the runner a intermittently and a cutter 51 reciprocally movable for chopping the runner a on the feed roller 50 . The chopped pieces are discharged through a hopper 79 and delivered into the injection molding machine for recycling.
