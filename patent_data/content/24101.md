# Mechanical connection and method of connecting mechanically two components.

## Abstract
In a mechanical connection between two components 10,26 410,426 each having a tubular part 12,24 414,424 , e.g. a tube to plate or tube to tube connection, the tubular part of one component is received within the tubular part of the other component, and at least one segment 32,33 432,433 of either tubular part 12,24 414,424 is staked to project radially and penetrate the other tubular part. whereby to secure the components together against separa tion and relative rotation. Various forms of apparatus are described and illustrated for forming the connection, each including a staking element 114 514 and means, such as a mandrel 90 490 for moving the staking elements radially to engage the tubular parts and stake them simultaneously.
