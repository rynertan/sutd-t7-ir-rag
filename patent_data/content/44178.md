# Fibrous composite materials and the production and use thereof.

## Abstract
A fibrous composite material of essentially two dimensional form in the form of individual fibres, sheets or layers comprising combustible fibres and lamellae of a layer mineral of size below 50 microns, a method for the manufacture of the fibrous composite materials by applying lamellae of a layer mineral to the fibres preferably from suspension followed by removal of the liquid phase of the suspension, and use of the fibrous composite materials for the fire protection of substrates.
