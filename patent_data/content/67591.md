# Al stabilized superconductor, and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to Al stabilized superconducting composite wire for use in superconducting magnets used in charging a magnetic field, such as a pulse magnet and the like, and particularly to Al stabilized superconducting com posite wire having the properties of reduced size, light weight, high current density, high stability, low AC loss, etc. The invention also provides a method for producing such wires. The Al stabilized superconducting composite wire 1 has a core which is chosen from superconducting elemen tary wire 2 , electrically insulated Cu or Cu alloy, or nonmagnetic metal or alloy thereof, and the superconduct ing elementary wires 2 and high purity Al wires 1 being alternately stranded around the core. The stranded cable is bonded by impregnating it with solder, or further subjected to a reduction process and heat treatment thereby enabling to obtain Al stabilized superconducting wire having said high properties.
