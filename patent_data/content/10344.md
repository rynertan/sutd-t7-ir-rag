# Digital signal detector.

## Abstract
A digital signal detector is disclosed that detects a serial bit stream transmitted at a predetermined bit frequency. Bit transistors are totalized in a counter 115 over a predetermined time interval. Bit transistions occuring during a good window interval from gate 111 increment the totalized count by one. Bit transistions occurring during a bad window interval from gate 112 decrement the totalized count by one. Bit transistions occurring during a marginal window interval from gate 110 , situated between the good and bad window intervals, do not affect the totalized count. If the counter 115 reaches a predetermined count during the time interval, a detect signal is provided by flip flop 117 indicating that the digital signal has been detected. The counter 115 can be further loaded with a threshold count for tailoring the digital signal detector for operation at a particular signal to noise ratio. Periodic signals that have frequencies that are submultiples of the bit frequency are detected by correlating the digital signal between two predetermined stages of a shift register 101 . The digital signal detector may provide a detector output signal when both the digital signal is detected at flip flop 117 and periodic signals having submultiple frequencies are not present at flip flop 106 .
