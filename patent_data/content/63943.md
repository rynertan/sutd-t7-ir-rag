## Abstract
A percussion actuated instantaneous or delay detonator transmits a detonation from a first length of low energy deto nating cord LEDC transversely positioned adjacent the de tonator s percussion responsive end to a U shaped segment of a second length of LEDC held with its apex against the base charge end of the detonator and the arms of the U ex tending away from the detonator. A directional connector for connecting a U shaped segment of detonating cord adjacent each end of the detonator has identifiable donor and receiver cord housing sections, e.g., the receiver cord housing sec tion has the shape of the head, and the donor cord housing section the shape of the butt, of an arrow. A connector adapt ed to hold receiver LEDC and high energy detonating cord HEDC segments is internally configured to receive nested U shaped segments of LEDC and HEDC only when the LEDC is adjacent the base charge end of the detonator.
