# JOINT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF MOTION FROM A DRIVING SHAFT TO A DRIVEN SHAFT

## Abstract
Elastic joint 1 for the transmission of motion between two shafts comprising two supports, a driving support 2 and a driven support 3 , associated to the shafts and a least two arms for each support. The joint comprises at least one single element for connecting the two arms 5, 6, 7, 8 , said element is in the form of a closed annular strap 4 of inextensible and flexible material. The strap can be disposed on a plane separating the two supports at a position substantially central to the joint so as to form a polygon whose vertices are the ends of the arms belonging alterna tively to the driving support and driven support.
