# Integrated MOS transistor and method of manufacturing it.

## Abstract
This invention is aimed at providing a semiconductor device of high degree of circuit integration and high reliability, and a method of manufacturing such devices in high yield. This invention provides a semiconductor device pro vided with a gate electrode 49 provided on a semiconduc tor substrate 41 of a first conductivity type and with an insulating film 47, 48 arrranged above and below it and a pair of first impurity regions 50₁, 51₁ of a second conductiv ity type provided mutually separated and self aligned with said gate electrode 49 in said substrate 41 characterized in that a wall 54 consisting of insulator provided on at least one side face of said gate electrode 49 and said upper and lower insulating films 47, 48 a second highly doped impurity region 50₂, 51₂ of second conductivity type provided in a self aligned manner with respect to said wall 54 in said substrate an electrode layer 59 connected to said second impurtiy region 50₂ 51₂ and whereof at least a portion extends over said upper insulating film 47 of said gate electrode 49 and a wiring layer selectively connected with said electrode layer. By means of this invention, as mentioned above, semi conductor devices of high degree of integration and high reliability can be manufactured in high yield.
