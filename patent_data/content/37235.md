# An article of manufacture, such as an automobile trim component, comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal and a process of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A vacuum metallized coating on a smooth dielectric sur face consists of minute, specular, electrically discreet metal particles less than 10 microns thick and having an average diameter of less than 30 microns. The coating is not electri cally conductive along the plane of the coating and when properly topcoated has excellent corrosion resistance. This form of metal film permits metals such as aluminium, silver and indium, which are not inherently corrosion resistant, to be used to make manufactures that are subjected to rigorous and abusive conditions in use, such as exterior automobile trim components. For such trim compo nents the dielectric substrate is preferably an elastomer such as a thermoplastics urethane and the metal layer is protected with a topcoat of a clear tough water resistant plastics film.

## Description
TITLE An article of manufacture, such as an automobile trim component, comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal and a process of manufacturing same. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an article of manufacture comprising a dielectric substrate, such as moulded plastics, with a surface coating of metal which may be deposited by vacuum metallizing and a process of manufacturing same, and is particularly, but not essentially, concerned with automobile trim components. BACKGROUND ART Vacuum metallizing of plastics and similar dielectric substrates has been practised for some time, see U. S.Patents 2,993,806 2,992,125 3,914,472 and 4,131,530.The automobile industry has had a desideratum for metallized trim components that could be substituted for conventional chrome plated metal parts. See Restoring theLuster to Metallized Markets , Modern Plastics, December 1974, page 42, et seq.. However, weather , abuse and corrosion resistance of such metallized plastics parts has been marginal. Work has been done in other fields with the vacuum depositing of indium, e.g. see JapanesePatent 15812 78 by Nobuyoshi Fujihashi and Hiroo Miyamoto.Work has also been reported on the effect of vacuum metallizing conditions on the deposited metal grain structure.See Influence of Substrate Temperature and DepositionRate on Structure of Thick Sputtered Cu Coatings by JohnA. Thorton, J. Vac. Sci. Technol., Vol. 12, No. 4, July Aug. 1975, page 830, et seq.. No reference has been found that relates metal grain structure or grain spacing to the appearance of the product, to the conductivity of the metal layer, to the corrosion resistance of the metal layer and or to the adhesion of a top coat. Recently some commercial products have been made see Sputtering in Production at Chevrolet , IndustrialFinishing, October, 1979, describing the Camaro Berlinetta grilles coated with a chrome alloy Alternatives to Conventional Chrome Plated Plastics by D. M. Lindsey of theGeneral Motors Chevrolet Engineering Center and a Critique on Current Preparation Techniques by Hugh R.Smith, Jr. of Industrial Vacuum Engineering, the latter two papers having been presented at the 1979 Society ofVacuum Coaters Annual Conference Ion Plating Using aPure Ion Source An Answer Looking for Problems , by Hale et al, Electronics Packaging and Production, May 1975, pg. 39 et seq and Continuous Vacuum Metallizing , ModernPlastics, December 1977, page 42 et seq..What is interesting about all of these articles is that while they describe the supposed successful manufacture of exterior automobile trim components that can reasonably be expected to give the performance required in service, they all fail to give the slightest hint or whisper that the vacuum metallized products do not look or appear as they should that they are in fact substantially darker appearing than electro deposited chrome and thus do not have the bright sheeny chrome look and showroom sparkle that a purchaser of a new automobile expects and demands. STATEMETI OF INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES According to the present invention there is provided an article of manufacture comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal characterised in that the dielectric substrate has a smooth surface, in that the surface coating of metal is a thin layer of minute metal particles on said smooth surface which layer is electrically non conductive along the plane of the layer, and in that a protective topcoating of an intimately adhered light passing film is provided over the thin layer. Further according to the present invention there is provided an article of manufacture comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal characterised in that the dielectric substrate has a smooth surface, in that the surface coating of metal is a thin specular layer of minute electrically discreet metal particles less than 10 microns thick on said smooth surface with the resistivity of said layer being greater than 2.5 olrn cm.and said particles having an average diameter of less than 30 microns and in that a protective topcoating of an intimately adhered clear elastomeric film at least 2.5 microns thick is provided over the thin layer. Still further according to the present invention there is provided a process of manufacturing an article comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal, the process being characterised in that a specular thin metal film of electrically discreet granular particles having a thickness of less than 10 microns, an average grain size less than 30 microns and a surface resistivity greater than 2.5 ohm cm. is deposited on a surface of the substrate by vacuum metallizing and in that a protective clear topcoat is applied thereover. Yet further according to the present invention there is provided an automobile trim component comprising a dielectric substrate with a surface coating of metal characterised in that the substrate comprises a smooth surface flexible elastomeric plastics base, in that the surface coating of metal comprises a vacuum deposited metal film less than 10 microns thick on said smooth surface, said metal film having a resistivity greater than 2.5 ohm cm. and appearing continuous and specular to the eye but essentially comprising electrically discreet columnar particles, and in that intimately bonded to the metal film is a flexible protective light passing elastomeric film greater than 2.5 microns thick. This product is particularly useful in the automobile industry as an automobile exterior trim component to replace heavier and more expensive conventional chrome plated metal parts. The present invention is based on the finding that with a thin vacuum metallized layer, if that layer is electrically non conductive, the metal layer is corrosionresistant if adequately topcoated. This can be so even if the bulk metal is not inherently corrosion resistant.It appears that the metal film to be non conductive should be deposited as discreet islands or columnar grains electrically isolated from one another, and that if this is achieved corrosion resistance results. This is so as long as the coating is quite thin, such that there is insufficient metal deposited to bring about a bridging or coalescence of the metal grains or columns. For most metals, the metal layer should be less than 10 microns thick, preferably less than 6 microns thick. It has been further found that if the individual metal grains or columns have a diameter that is a fraction of the wave length of light, say a diameter of less than 35 microns, preferably less than 30 microns on the average, the metal layer is quite bright and specular and not milky or whitish as occurs when the grain size exceeds about 40 microns If indium is the metal deposited, the appearance of the metal layer looks much like that of chrome plate. Wnile commercial products have heretofore been made from metals that are inherently corrosion resistant such as chromium or stainless steel, such vacuum metallized films are dark and unsatisfactory appearing. The present invention, however, permits the use of metals which are not inherently corrosion resistant such as aluminium and silver and thus permit one to obtain a better colour match with electrodeposit chrome. An indium coating is particularly good in this regard. The metal film can be deposited by thermal evaporization, sputtering, ion plating, induction heating, electron beam evaporization and like methods see Thin Film Tech nolog , by Berry et al, D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc.,Princeton, New Jersey, 1968, Lib. of Cong. 68 25817.If the metallizing is carried out in a manner to secure a low rate of deposition of the metal atoms the formation of the desired electrically discontinuous coating is enhanced. Also, better or more uniform coverage appears to be secured especially with objects having corners, edges, or recesses if some atoms of an inert gas such as argon are present in the vacuum chamber in excess of those re quire for the evaporation. The vacuum deposition is preferably carried out at a vacuum of 5 x 10 3 Torr or less. Specularity drops as the diameter of the grain nears the wave lengths of visible light. The deposited metal layer should not be too thin as it becomes transparent and reflectance drops off. Generally speaking for most metals the deposited film should have a thickness of at least 1 micron. Another finding embodied in this invention is that when proper grain distinction is obtained improved adhesion of the protective plastics topcoat results. This adhesion can be measured, for example, by the Ford adhestion test,Specification No. ESB M2P 105 B, or the Chevrolet tape adhesion test, Specification No. CTZ VM003 AA. This improved adhesion appears to be related to the amount of separation between the individual metal grains or columns, i.e. to the distinctiveness of the grains, rather than to the diameter or size of the grains. For most applications, the deposited metal film must be protected with a topcoat to improve resistance to mechanical abuse and protect the metal from weathering and oxidation. Clear moisture resistant acrylic, urethane, epoxy, and like coatings applied as a latex and more preferably as a solvent solution are suitable. For critical applications the topcoat will often be baked to assure that a good tough continuous film is produced. The plastics film appears to fill the interstices and voids between the individual metal grains and helps further isolate one grain from another.Once so protected, if the surface is exposed to a corrosive medium tending to promote oxidation of the metal layer and if the plastics film in one minute area is breached by the medium with oxidation of some of the metal grains contiguous to the breach, the blight does not spread along the metal film because of the electrical isolation of the grains. 1 invention is most usefully applied to metals which are not inherently strongly corrosion resistant silver, zinc, indium, tin, aluminium, cadmium, copper, nickel, cobalt or iron as opposed to stainless steel, gold, platinum, chromium, nichrome, palladium and rhodium.Some of the latter such as rhodium are prohibitively expensive. Indium gives an excellent colour match to chrome plate and is the preferred metal in the preparation of automobile trim components Stainless steel can be made to yield an interestina appearing product and especially if deposited simultaneously or sequentially with an enhancing metal such as silver. Any suitable dielectric, i.e electrically insulating, material can be used to receive the vacuum deposited metal such as dry wood, class or plastics.. For the intended automobile trim component application a castable or mouldable plastics is used, preferably an elastomer that is tough and abuse resistant with some flexibility such as an injection moulding grade thermoplastics polyurethane TPu . By 1flexible elastomer 1 is meant a natural or synthetic thermoplastics or thermoset plastics or polymer having an extensibility of greater than approximately 30O,ó as compared to rigid plastics which has an extensibility of less than 10 .Of course, for many applications where the article will not be subjected to mechanical abuse, rigid plastics are perfectly suitable, such as for instrument cluster trim or grilles. Examples of suitable rigid plastics are polyolefin, such as a polypropylene, a polacrlonitrile Btdiene styrene and a polycarbonate. The nature of the flexible substrate does not appreciably affect the performance of the applied coatings.The substrate cannot be so stiff or rigid that it will not serve its intended function as a flexible trim com ponent nor can it be too flexible or elastomeric. The present coating system can be applied over such flexible substrates as reaction injection moulded urethane, thermoplastics olefins, nylon, rubber and polycarbonates.A suitable primer may be necessary to smooth or gain adherence to the substrate. The present coating system can, of course, be applied and used with substantially more rigid substrates, but other methods of bright trimming such as electroplating might be more economical to use on firm or hard surfaces. The vacuum deposited metal layer mirrors the surface on which it is deposited, i.e. the surface smoothness or roughness shows up in the deposited metal layer.For bright sheeny parts it is preferred to have the surface on to which the metal layer is deposited to be as smooth as possible. Flame or thermally reflowed urethanes are particularly useful in this regard. Often it is desirable to overcoat the base plastics with a clear or pigmented basecoat of some sort prior to the carrying out of the vacuum deposition step. Pigmented prime coats can be used to obtain an initial levelling of the base plastics surface following which a clear or pigmented base coat can be applied to give a mirror smooth surface.These layers can be heat treated or baked as required to develop their maximum properties If a urethane substrate is used, weatherability of the article may be improved by using a pigmented base coat that prevents light penetration to the plastics base. Light can pass through the metallized layer in amounts sufficient to have a degrading effect on the lower plastics layers. Sputtering and thermal evaporation are preferred methods of laying down the metal layer although the use of ion plating, induction heating or electron beam evaporation methods are not precluded so long as they give the discreet granular structure that results in electrical non conductivity. Following the deposition of the metal layer the clear plastics topcoat, preferably one resistant to moisture penetration, is applied. Generally the thickness of the topcoat will be at least 2.5 microns thick dry basis and usually will not exceed 125 microns thick. For flexible exterior automobile trim, the topcoat is necessarily elastomeric and if thermo setting, it can be thoroughly baked, for example at 1200C or so, to develop its maximum properties. The topcoat is formulated to adhere both to the metal as well as to the base plastics. As the metal film exists as discreet particles flexing or bending of the metal film will not result in the further macro cracking of the metal layer and there is therefore no objectionable change in its appearance when the plastics part is bent or stretched and the stress is released. FIGURES OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention will now be further described, by way of example onlyi with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a graph comparing the percent diffuse reflectance the ordinate of a metallized coating by this invention against comparative coatings at various wave lengths of visible light spectrum expressed in nanometers the axis except for Example A, all the samples were topcoated FIGURE 2 is a micro photograph taken with a scanning electron microscope at 44,000 magnification of an indium layer prepared by thermal evaporation in accordance with the process of this invention the view angle is 450 and the grains have an average grain diameter of about 18 microns and FIGURE 3 is a similar micro photograph of a similarly prepared indium coating except that the average particle size is about 45 microns this coating, while having a diffuse reflectivity of 82 before topcoating, was quite milky, was definitely conductive and had poor corrosion resistance . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The coatings giving the data of FIGURE 1 were obtained using a Thermal Evaporator made by Consolidated VacuumCorporation, Rochester, New York. Unless otherwise described, flat plaques were prepared for testing. The reflectances were obtained with an Integrated SphereSpectrophotometer with specular component included, ModelACS 500S, made by Applied Color Systems, Inc., U. S.Highway 1, Princeton, New Jersey. A barium sulphate surface has a diffuse reflectance of 100 on this scale. In FIGURE 1, line A is a plot of the reflectance of conventional electroplated chromium surface, used as a standard or goal. Line B is a plot of the reflectance of an article in accordance with this invention, being about a 2.2 micron thick coating of indium with a clear topcoat, prepared as set out hereinafter in the Examples. It can be seen that the diffuse reflectance of the indium coating compares favourably with that of electro deposited chrome.The indium without the topcoat has a higher reflectance than that of the chrome but the addition of the topcoat tones the reflectance down to what is illustrated. Line C gives the reflectance of a sputtered chromium surface topcoated with the same topcoat as in B. It can be seen that sputtered chromium, which has a higher reflectance than chromium vacuum deposited by other techniques, is substantially darker than electrodeposited chromium. Line D is the chrome alloy used for the CamaroBerlinetta TPU grille as described in the IndustrialFinishing article, supra the measurement having been obtained from the part itself. It can be seen that the appearance of the part is dark and unsatisfactory, which is why perhaps it is used in an unobtrusive location and manner. Line E shows the least satisfactory metallized coating tested and yet this coating was described by thePennwalt Corporation as being highly reflective as having solved the problem of bright metal plastics finishing.See the Continuous Vacuum Metallizing article supra, page 45. These data were obtained from a topcoated chromium alloy metallized sample, the metal of which was thermally evaporated by Pennwalt. Well prepared topcoated sputtered stainless steel is slightly darker than Line C. The minimum resistance at which the vacuum metallized layer becomes conductive and corrosion prone is difficult to establish. By the following procedure it was determined that a thin film of indium when deposited with sufficient thickness had a resistivity of about 5 ohms, which jumped to over 100 megaohms as the deposited metal film was made thinner down to about 25 millimicrons. Intermediate resistivity values between these two could not be established. The test was carried out with a Megger brand insulation tester supplied by the Biddle Company ofPlymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Test strips of the vacuum deposited indium were prepared on a dielectric plastics base.The strips were 1 2 12.7 mm wide x 1.1 2 38 mm . A 1 2 12.7 mm section at each end was used for copper contact pads from the tester, leaving a 1 2 12.7 mm square centre section as the test area. 500 volts were applied to the contact pads to obtain the indicated readings. By suitable calculation, it can be shown that the 100 megaohm resistance value translated, when considering the thickness of the metal film, to a resistivity of 2.5 ohm cm.. FIGURE 2 shows the granular, columnar surface of an indium coating thermally evaporated onto a substrate plastics plaque having a composition as in Example 1.The coating thickness was about 2.5 microns and the average grain size was 18 microns. The diffuse reflectivity of the coating without topcoat was 74. The coating was non conductive by the above test and corrosion resistant when topcoated. A similar sample was prepared having an average particle size of about 36 microns. It had a reflectivity of 80 not topcoated but was hazy in appearance with a bluish cast. It was marginally non conductive. The grains apparently had started to grow together. The coating of FIGURE 3 was milky in appearance, had a reflectivity of 82 not topcoated , and was definitely non conductive, with a grain size of 45 microns, which definitely exceeds acceptable limits. EXAMPLESExample 1 The sample part is a 1980 Cougar Chin Grille,Chevrolet Part No. xR7 234, injection moulded with Goodrich 58130 thermoplastics urethane TPU . A urethane enamel basecoat is applied over the grille. It is a standard production item supplied by PPG Industries, asESP3967. This coating is a melamine modified blocked aliphatic urethane. This coating is light stable and is pigmented white to block light from reaching non light stable substrates. The basecoat is thinned and sprayed according to manufacturer s instructions onto the properly cleaned surface at room temperature to a thickness of 25.4 1 5.1 microns dry basis . The applied coating requires an air flash of 20 minutes and is then baked for approximately 60 minutes at approximately 1200C to reach full properties. After the grille is cooled to room temperature it is vacuum metallized with indium thermally evaporated at low power from boats according to the following procedure A bell jar is pumped down to 1 x 10 Torr and then back filled with argon to 3 x 10 Torr. The pumping system for the bell jar consists of a mechanical roughing pump, a silicone oil diffusion pump, and a liquid nitrogen coldtrap to minimize organic and water vapour in the bell jar. The function of the argon backfill is to obtain better coverage on three dimensional parts. The indium is thermally evaporated from a 0.25 micron tungsten boat 4.3 4 121 mm length, 1 8 3.2 mm dimple x 1.1 2 38 mm long connected in series to a 5 volt AC variable transformer. The grille is rotated at 21 RPM with source to substrate varying during rotation from 8.1 2 216 mm to 14.1 2 368 mm . The boat is pre heated at 200 amps for 10 seconds. The power is raised to 235 amps for 70 seconds and indium is evaporated at a rate of 0.025 to 0.04 microns per second. The topcoat is a solvent based aliphatic urethane prepared from 753 parts Union Carbide Hylene W, 506 partsUnion Carbide PCP 0300 polycaprolactone polyol, 240 parts hexanediol adipate, and 23 parts Dow Corning DC 193 silicone. The topcoat is spray applied at 17 solids to a thickness of 25.4 1 5.1 microns dry basis . The coating is air flashed for 20 minutes and then baked for 60 minutes at approximately 1200C to reach full properties. The completed composite gives the following performance against the Ford ESB M2P105 B Elastomeric Exterior Paint Performance specification 1.
