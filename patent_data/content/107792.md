# Photopolymerizable compositions.

## Abstract
A photopolymerizable composition which comprises an addition polymerizable compound having at least one ethylenically unsaturated double bond and a photopolymer ization initiator system, characterized in that said photo polymerization initiator system essentially consists of a a p dialkylaminostyrene derivative or p dialkyl aminophenylbutadiene derivative represented by the general formula
