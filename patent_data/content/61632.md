# Simplified maintenance electrocoagulator.

## Abstract
An apparatus including at least one module having a plurality of closely spaced, flat electrodes 20 defining a plurality of flow paths there between. Each electrode 20 is trapezoidally shaped and each pair of plates forms a notch 26 in the upper portion thereof to permit collection of the treated water. Each pair of electrodes is isolated within the module by a barrier plate preferably constructed of fiber glass. Barrier plates divide the module into separate elec trode containing cells each electrode in each cell being separately coupled to a source of alternating current. The side walls 46 of each module support a base plate 48 containing holes which correspond to holes in the gasket seal 52 and those in the bottom member 42 . Each framed pair of electrodes 20 rests on gasket 52 which acts as a seal so that individual pairs of electrodes 20 may be removed merely by lifting the entire pair of electrodes out of the module.
