# IMPROVED VAPOUR CYCLE SYSTEM

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved vapour cycle system in particular, but not exclusively, for use in air conditioning and refrigeration plants. According to the present invention, there is provided an improved vapour cycle system comprising a receiver for storing a working fluid an evaporator for receiving liquid working fluid from the receiver a heat exchanger for receiving an entraining fluid and heating said entraining fluid to produce a high pressure gas a jet pump for receiving said high pressure gas from said heat exchanger and drawing into it evaporated working fluid from said evaporator and means for feeding condensed working fluid to said receiver.
