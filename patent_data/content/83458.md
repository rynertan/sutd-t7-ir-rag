# Method of partially metallising electrically conductive non metallic patterns.

## Abstract
The partial metallisation of electrically conductive non metallic patterns, for example transparent patterns of indium oxide and or tin oxide or resistance layers of cermet material, on insulating carriers by means of an electroless plating solu tion. The plating is initiated by applying a potential difference for a short period of time between the patterns and an auxiliary electrode.
