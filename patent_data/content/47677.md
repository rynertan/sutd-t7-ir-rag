# A method and apparatus for continuously separating solids and liquids in a solids liquid mixture.

## Abstract
A separation zone 118 for separating solids and liquids from a solids liquid mixture is provided in which the mixture is subjected to centrifugal force under low shear forces and low turbulence. In the separation zone 118 , the flow rate is maintained to be less than the terminal settling velocity of the solids in the mixture. The mixture is intro duced into the separation zone 118 from a zone 120 of higher turbulence and higher flow rate than those of the separation zone 118 , a minor part of the mixture in the other zone 120 being removed to the separation zone 118 . The major part of the mixture is removed from the other zone 120 and discharged through a port 132 and returned to the mixture source in such a manner as to aerate the returned mixture. The separated solids are returned to the mixture source with the major part of the mixture. The separated solids and liquid are removed from the apparatus continuously. The invention is particularly useful in obtain ing a highly clarified centrate from sewage sludge.
