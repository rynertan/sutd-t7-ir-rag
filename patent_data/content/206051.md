# Multi joint robot controller.

## Abstract
A multi joint robot controller is facilitated in its synchro nous operation of a multi joint robot and a rotary table for per forming predetermined tasks by dexterously recognizing the position and attitude of the table with the present invention. The robot controller comprises position detection means for detecting a position of an arm of the multi joint robot as coor dinates of a coordinate system assigned to the multi joint ro bot specific point detection means for detecting coordinates of a specific point TA on the rotary table, by the robot as signed coordinate system, making use of the position detec tion means, at any rotating angle of the rotary table and table attitude calculation means for calculating an attitude of the ro tary table on the basis of the robot assigned coordinate sys tem from coordinates of a plurality of positions of the specific point detected by the specific point detection means.
