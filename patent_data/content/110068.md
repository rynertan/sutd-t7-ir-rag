# HYDROPHOBIC DENTAL CAVITY LINERS

## Abstract
Dental cavity lining compositions are provided which are substantially hydrophobic while retaining the ability to stimulate the production of secondary dentin by vital, pulpal tissues. According to a preferred embodiment, metal oxide or hydroxide containing compositions are provided which comprise an amount sufficient to impart substantial hydro phobicity to the compositions of a fluorinated polymeric hydrocarbon. According to another preferred embodiment, the fluorinated polymeric hydrocarbon comprises polytetra fluoroethylene. The neopentyl diesters of a salicylic acid are described as being superior hardenable species for in clusion in such dental cavity linings.
