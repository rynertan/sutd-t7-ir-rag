# Insulation displacement contact latching terminal.

## Abstract
An IDC terminal has a body portion 10 from which extend a terminal portion 11 having a pair of tines 12, 13 and a latching portion 14 having a pair of latches. The terminal has a solder tail 22 or other connector portion. A connector assembly includes two housing parts 60, 65 and a set of terminals. The latching portion 14 of each terminal engages the two housing parts so that the housing parts are held together at each terminal location. The latching portion 14 extends from the body portion 10 independently of the terminal portion 11 so that movement of the latching portion 14 does not effect electrical connection with the terminal portion 11 and a conductor.
