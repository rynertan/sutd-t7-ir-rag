## Description
Method for the production of benzene and cumene The present invention relates to a method for the production of benzene and cumene from the heavy by products of the process for the production of cumene by the catalytic alkylation of benzene with propylene.It is known in the art to produce cumene by the catalytic alkylation of benzene with propylene, for example cn supported photphoric acia catalysts.In these processes, in addition to the cumene isopropylbenzene , by products are also formed which result from the further alkylation of the benzene, in particular di isopropylbenzenes and products of the alkylation of benzene with higher olefines such as butenes, pentenes, hexenes timers of propylene etc., present in the technical prepylene or which form during the alkylation reaction.These heavy byproducts, which will be termed cumene bottoms or simply bottoms in the present specification, separate at the bottom of the cumene distillation column and result in a smaller yield of the useful reaction product and loss of valued compounds.It has thus been proposed to subject the diisopropylbenzenes in the cumene bottoms to transalkylation by the addition of benzene to the bottoms, the reaction being carried out in the presence of catalysts such as boron and aluminium halides commonly known as Friedel Crafts catalysts. The use of such catalysts, however, involves various disadvantages due to corrosion and ecological problems as well as problems resulting frbm the high consumption of the catalysts themselves.In order to overcome these disadvantages, it has been proposed in the art to use heterogeneous transalkylation catalysts such as, for example, zeolites USP 3,385,906 which are active in a temperature range of from 130 to 250 C, or zeolites containing a metal, such as nickel, palladium or platinum within their structure DE OS 2,127,481 shiah are active in a hydrogen environment and within a temperature range of from 275 to 350 C. The present invention is based on the finding that catalysts constituted by natural silico aluminAtes with a silica alumina ratio greater tan or equal to 3 1, pretreated with a mineral acid, and on which a hydrogenating metal has been deposited, are active not only in the transesterification of dialkylbenznes like the catalysts of the prior art but also in the dealkylation of monoalkylbenzenes, when the reaction is carried out in a hydrogen environment, in accordance with the following general reactions EMI2.1 Consequently, some of the benzene required by the transalkylation reaction is generated within the reaction environment itself, with obvious economic advantages.In particular the consumption of benzene is of the order of 0.15 0.20 parts by weight per part by weight of cumene produced, compared with the stoichiometric quantity required by the transalkylation reaction which is 0.65 parts by weight of benzene per part by weight of cumene.In accordance with this, the present invention relates to a method for the dealkylation and transesterification of cumene bottoms in which the bottoms, possibly after the addition of benzene, are placed in contact with a catalyst constituted by a natural silico aluminate with a silica alumina ratio greater than or equai to 3 1, pretreated with a mineral acid, on which a metal belonging to group VIII of the periodic system of the elements has been deposited, and the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase under hydrogen at a pressure of from 10 to 60 bar and at a temperature of from 150 to 3500C until a substantial quantity of the bottoms has been converted into benzene and cumene and the benzene and cumene are separated and recovered from the reaction mixture.The catalysts used in the method of the present invention are constituted by a natural silico aluminate having a silica alumina ratio greater than or equal to 3 1, pretreated with a mineral acidand containing a metal from group VIII of the periodic system of the elementsNatural silico aluminates suitable for the purpose are bentonites, particul√Öarly those having a high montmorillonite content. It is known that montmorillonite is a sodium, calcium and magnesium silico aluminate having the following general formula Al1.67Mg0.33Na0.33 Si4 010 OH 2The percentage montmorillonite in bentonites generally varies from 60 to 80 by weight, the remainder being constituted by materials such as silica, calcite, illite, etc.The treatment of the bentonites with mineral acids, such . as sulphuric, hydrofluoric, hydrochloric acld etc., partly or completely removes the alkali metals, which are replaced by hydrogen, and one thus obtains the so called activated acid earths.The acid earth corn.ercially known under the trademark FILTROL made by the Filtrol Company, Los Angeles USA , s, of the commercial acid earths, that most particularly suitable for the purposes of the present invention.These activated acid earths themselves have transalkylating catalytic activities however under the conditions of the present inventive method, they rapidly becone deactivated and are thus not useful for this purpose. Therefore, according to the present invention, a metal from group VIII of the periodic system, generally palladium, platinum, nickel or cobalt, is deposited on the acid earth.It has been found, , surprisingly, that these catalysts do not have an appreciable hydrogenating action on the aromatic nucleus under the conditions of the present inventive method and give conversions of the clllene bottoms of from 50 to 100 with a selectivity towards cumene of more than about 90g. Among all the catalytic metals nickel has been found to be the most suitable because it has practically no hydrogenating effect and it has a very high resistance to ageing.The quantity of metal in the catalyst may vary from 0.05 to 5 by weight with respect to the silico aluminate of the support, with preferred values of from 0.1 to 1 in the case of palladium or platinum and from 1 to 5 by weight in the cage of nickel or cobalt.The catalyst may be prepared by impregnating the activated acid earth wit an aqueous, possibly acidic solution of a salt of the metal which it is intended to cessjosit for example palladium chloride or nickel nitratej. The acid earth thus treated is then dried at a temperature of the order of 100 130 C and finally calcined t temperatures of the order of 200 400 C. The catalyst obtained is conveniently treated before use in an atmosphere of hydrogen for 3 to 5 hours at a temperature of from 150 to 5000C. In an embodiment of the method of the present invention the cumene bottoms as such, or with an addition of benzene, are fed to and brought into contact with the catalystIn particular, the molar ratio between the added benzene and the bottoms may vary generally from 0 1 to 20 1. It is however noted that the presence of added benzene favours the transalkylation and dealkylation reactions and retards the ageing of the catalyst.On the other hand it is noted that a large quantity of added benzene does not give substantial advantages.Hence in the preferred embodiment, a mixture of benzene and cumene bottoms is fed to the catalyst in a molar ratio of 2 1 to 10 1.The preferred reaction temperatures are within the range 200 to 3000C. The hydrogen pressures may vary in general from 10 to 60 bar and, in a preferred embodiment, are within the range 20 to 40 bar.In practice this corresponds roughly to a hydrogen oranic molar ratio of 1 1 to 10 1 for the wider pressure range and from 2 1 to 5 1 for the preferred pressure range.In practice the reaction may be carried out by passing the liquid reaction mixture over the catalyst deposited in the form of a fixed bed, at a rate of passage of the mixture of from 0.5 to 5 volumes of the mixture per volume of catalyst per hour.The reaction products obtained, after separation of the hydrogen, are treated to separate the valued constituents, particularly benzene and cumene. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction products are conveyed to the distillation reaction stage of the plant for the production of cumene by the alkylation of benzene with propylene.If the activity of the catalyst tes to fall during use, the supply of cumene bottoms may be suspended and the catalyst may be treated with benzene alone in the presence of hydrogen, in other conditions appropriate for the reaction. Thus complete activation of the catalyst is achieved in a period of the order of 0.5 3 hours.The method of the present invention is particularly advantageous when used in combination with any method for the production of cumene by the catalytic alkylation of benzene with propylene.In these alkylation processes, carried out in the liquid or gaseous phases, at a temperature within the range 50 400tC, benzene and propylene are conveyed to the catalyst phosphoric acid, aluminium halide, silica alumina, acid resins etc. , with a molar excess of the first over the second, and the propylene is converted substantially completely to give a reaction product constituted by the excess benzene, cumene and cumene bottoms.These latter consist essentially of di isopropylbenzenes about 70 and products of the alkylation of benzene with oligomers of propylene about 25 and constitute the feed for the process of the present invention once separated from the benzene and the cumene.The experimental examples which follow are illustrative and non limitative of the invention. In the Examples, the parts and percentages are expressed by weight if not otherwise indicated.Example 1The commercial acid earth FILTROL G .24, having the following composition Si02 67.28Al2O3 13.8 Fe203 0.99 CaNa 0.028 H2O balance to 100, in the form of 30 to 60 mesh granules, is added to a solution of palladium chloride Pd Cl2 dissolved in 6N hydrochloric acid, the mass being kept under agitation. The quantity of palladium chloride is such as to ensure a 0.1 by weight of palladium metal in the finished catalyst. The mixture is then kept under agitation at 80 C until the greater part of the hydrochloric acid has evaporated.It is then dried in an oven at 110 C for 4 hours and subsequently in a muffle at 240 C for 4 hours.The catalyst obtained is sieved to remove powder with a grain size of less than 60 mesh and is then loaded into a cylindrical reactor height 20 cm diameter 2.5 cm having a thermostatic jacket.The catalyst is activated in the reactor by heat in a flow of hydrogen 30 l hour at a pressure of 35 bar, at a temperature of 240 C for 5 hours.In this example cumene bottoms are used which result from a process for the alkylation of benzene with propylene on a supported phosphoric acid catalyst, and which have the following composition cumene 1.13 8 butylbenzenes 3 96 pentylbenzenes 4.46 z meta di isopropylbenzene 23.23 . ortho di isopropylbenzene 8.3 para di isopropylbenzene 25.92 8 hexylbenzenes 22,g other alkylaromatics 10.1 These cumene bottoms are distilled to separate the fraction having the following composition cumene 1.28 8 butylbenzenes 4.46 t pentylbenzenes 5.02 meta di isopropylbenzene 25.27 z ortho di isopropylbenzee 9.5 para di isopropylbenzene 97.74 t hexylbenzenes 26.74 The fraction distilled is mixed with various quantities of benzene to give the mixtures A, B and C which are treated by the method of the present invention.
