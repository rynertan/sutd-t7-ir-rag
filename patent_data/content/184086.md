## Description
Vaccination with live attenuated strains is extensively and successfully used in the prevention of various viral diseases of man, such as polio, smallpox, and measles. By contrast, live vaccines are used against only a few bacterial diseases of man or domestic animals BCG vaccine for prevention of tuberculosis, strain 19 vaccine against bovine brucellosis and Sterne s spore vaccine against anthrax in cattle. Yet in many investigations of experimental The non virulent strains used as vaccines have been obtained in various ways. The BCG strain was derived by empirical procedures during prolonged Recently, bacterial strains have been developed for use as live vaccines which are streptomycin dependent mutants of strains of several pathogenic species. Since live vaccines have substantially greater probability of success in providing for protection for the host against a subsequent invasion of a virulent wild strain, it is desirable to develop new live vaccines which avoid the shortcomings of vaccines prepared previously. Because the immune response of the vertebrate host to antigens, in particular surface antigens, of the pathogenic microorganism is the basic mechanism of protection by vaccination a live vaccine should retain the antigenic complement of the wild type strain. The live vaccine should be non virulent, substantially incapable of multiplication in the host, and should have substantially no probability for reverting to a virulent wild strain. A non virulent live vaccine may also serve as a host for the expression of antigens which may be located in the cytoplasm, translocated to the plasma or outer membrane or secreted to provide immunogens for an immunogenic response by the mammalian host. By employing a live vaccine as a carrier for an immunogen, particularly an invasive host, such as Sandhu et al., In a private communication, Dr. John Roth, Department of Biology, University of Utah, developed two strains of Live vaccines are provided for vaccinating a host against a pathogenic microorganism, particularly bacteria, as well as serving as carriers for immunogens of other pathogens, particularly microorganisms, including viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The live vaccines are prepared by producing auxotrophic mutants of a pathogenic strain, wherein one biosynthetic pathway is blocked, so that the bacterial mutant requires for proliferation at least one nutrient which is normally not available in the host in the amount required by the microorganism. The auxotrophic mutation is a result of a genetic change in at least two independent genes in the same biosynthetic pathway which changes cannot be repaired by any single step. Such genetic changes include deletion and or inversion of a polynucleotide segment of the gene, particularly where an inversion occurs immediately adjacent to an inserted foreign nucleotide sequence in the gene. For the purposes of the invention, these changes will be referred to as non reverting mutations. Normally, the non reverting mutation will not affect the antigenic constitution of the pathogenic microorganism, and, in particular, will not alter its surface antigens, some of which may be important determinants of pathogenicity. The resulting auxotrophic mutants have substantially zero probability of reversion, while having the same, or substantially the same, immunogenic characteristics as the virulent strain, so as to produce an effective immunogenic response. In particular, auxotrophic mutants are obtained by employing a virulent strain, desirably having a genetic marker allowing its selection and creating at least one non reverting mutation in at least two independent genes, so as to produce a complete block in biosynthesis of one essential metabolite which is not normally available in vertebrate tissues. By isolating the mutant and screening for inability to revert, lack of virulence and immunizing ability when used as live vaccines, strains useful for live vaccines may be obtained. Vaccines prepared from live, non virulent microorganisms are provided which are particularly useful in vaccinating vertebrate hosts susceptible to disease from corresponding pathogenic microorganisms. The non virulent microorganisms, particularly bacteria, can serve as carriers for antigens for other pathogens, so as to produce a multiple immunogenic response and promote humoral and or cellular protection from two or more pathogens. The microorganisms are auxotrophic, having a non reverting, non leaky block in at least two genes in one biosynthetic pathway causing a requirement for nutrient s not available in the animal to be vaccinated in amounts sufficient to allow multiplication of the microorganism. Thus, the vaccine strains may be grown on media supplemented with nutrient s , and when introduced to the host will continue to live until eliminated by the host s immune response , but will be unable to proliferate. The non reverting block is created by introducing a mutation into genes encoding an enzyme indispensably needed for particular steps in a biosynthetic pathway. Since the product of the pathway is unavailable in the host to be vaccinated, the microorganism will be unable to proliferate even though it is alive and retains its native antigenic characteristics. The mutation is non reverting because restoration of normal gene function can occur only by random coincidental occurrence of more than one event, each such event being very infrequent. In the case of a deletion mutation restoration of genetic information would require many coincidental random nucleotide insertions, in tandem, to restore the lost genetic information. In the case of an insertion plus inversion, restoration of gene function would require coincidence of precise deletion of the inserted sequence and precise re inversion of the adjacent inverted sequence, each of these events having an exceedingly minute, undetectably low, frequency of occurrence. Thus each of the two sorts of non reverting auxotrophic mutations has a substantially zero probability of reverting to prototrophy. While a single non reverting block provides a high degree of security against possible reversion to virulence, there still remain events which, while unlikely, have a finite probability of occurrence. Opportunities for reversion exist where microorganisms exist in the host which may transfer by conjugation the genetic capability to the non virulent organism. In addition to the auxotrophic mutations which prevent multiplication in the vaccinated animal, it is desirable that the microorganism for use as live vaccine have one or more genetic marker characters making it easily distinguishable from other microorganisms of the same species, either wild strains or other live vaccine strains. Conveniently, the marker may be a nutritional requirement, such as a histidine requirement. Such markers are useful in distinguishing the vaccine strain from wild type strains, particularly when a vaccinated patient succumbs to After manipulating the microorganism so as to introduce the non reverting mutations into some members of the population the microorganisms are grown under conditions facilitating isolation of the auxotrophic mutants, either under conditions under which such mutants have a selective advantage over parental bacteria or under conditions allowing their easy recognition from unaltered bacteria or mutants of other types. The isolated auxotrophic mutants are cloned and screened for virulence, inability to revert and ability to protect the host from a virulent pathogenic strain. The subject method for preparing the vaccines and the vaccines have a large number of advantages over prior vaccines. As contrasted with other vaccines, the subject invention provides for the exact cause of the loss of virulence. Unlike other live vaccine strains which are non virulent because of alteration of lipopolysaccharide character, the subject vaccines will be substantially unaltered in O antigenic character, as well as other surface antigens which may have relevance to virulence and immunity, such as the major outer membrane proteins. Thus, the subject vaccines would stimulate production of anti O antibodies which are known to be important components in the immunity obtainable by vaccination. The subject strains should be able to persist in the host for extended periods of time, usually weeks, to enhance the effectiveness of the immunizing effect by continuous stimulation of the host immune system until the host immune system has cleared all the organisms. The auxotrophic mutants having non reverting, non leaky mutations in independent genes in the same biosynthetic pathway will have substantially zero likelihood of reverting to virulence. In view of the fact that the non virulence depends upon the absence of relevant metabolites in host tissues and not on any host cellular function, the subject strains will be non virulent even in immunodeficient hosts. Among bacteria, the subject invention is particularly applicable to a wide variety of Other organisms for which the subject invention may also be employed include Shigella, particularly The vaccines can be used with a wide variety of domestic animals, as well as man. Included among domestic animals which are treated by vaccines today or could be treated, if susceptible to bacterial diseases, are chickens, cows, pigs, horses, goats, and sheep, to name the more important domestic animals. In preparing the live vaccines, one chooses a strain of the pathogen which desirably has a marker for distinguishing the auxotrophic mutant to be produced from other members of the strain. Alternatively, such a marker can be introduced into the vaccine strain. Various markers can be employed, such as resistance to antibiotic or synthetic antibacterial drug, a block in a biosynthetic pathway causing requirement for an amino acid, e.g., histidine, or the like. The limitation on the particular marker is that it should not affect the immunogenic character of the microorganism, nor should it interfere with the processing of the microorganism to produce the live vaccine. The marker will alter the phenotype, to allow for recognition of the subject microorganism. The subject organism will then be processed to provide non reverting mutations in the independent genes of the same biosynthetic pathway. Each non reverting mutation will involve a polynucleotide of greater than five nucleotides, more preferably a polynucleotide of at least ten nucleotides, and together will block one biosynthetic pathway. The mutations may be deletions, insertions, or inversions, or combinations thereof. The blocked biosynthetic pathway should not be involved in the production of the antigens involved with the microorganisms virulence, nor the host s immune response to infection by the microorganism. Various techniques can be employed for introducing deletions or insertion inversions, so as to achieve a microorganism having the desired non leaky non reverting biosynthetic pathway block. The choice of genes will be governed by the ability to mutate the genes without destroying the viability of the microorganism the essential nature of the product expressed by the gene and the unlikely presence of the product in the intended host. The blocked gene must prevent production of an enzyme required in the biosynthetic pathway of a metabolite necessary for multiplication, but not otherwise necessary for viability. Genes of particular interest include several of the One technique for producing a non reverting biosynthetic pathway block is the employment of translocatable elements, in particular transposons. Transposons are segments of double stranded DNA, made UP of some thousands of nucleotides, and normally comprising a gene for resistance to an antibiotic or other antibacterial drug, together with genes which can effect the insertion of a copy of the transposon at any of very many different sites in the DNA of the bacterium housing the transposon. Insertion of a transposon into a gene which specifies the amino acid sequence of an enzymically active protein causes complete loss of ability to synthesize that protein in active form. However the whole transposon is, at a low frequency for instance, 10 ⁸ bacterium generation deleted or excised from the gene into which it was inserted, this gene in consequence being restored to its original state, so that it again specifies an enzymically active protein. Such precise excision of a transposon causes loss of the resistance to the antibiotic or other antibacterial agent, which resulted from the action of the resistance gene of the transposon. In addition to precise excision, loss of resistance conferred by the transposon occurs also by other kinds of events, which are much more frequent than precise excision and do not result in reconstitution of the original form of the gene, thus not resulting in restoration of the lost gene function. Two kinds of such event result in production of a non reverting non functional form of the gene into which the transposon was inserted one event is deletion of a segment of DNA comprising the whole ora part of the transposon, including its resistance gene, and a segment of DNA extending to one side of the site of insertion, thus extending into, sometimes entirely through, part of the gene into which the transposon was inserted, to one side of the site of insertion the other event is deletion of a part of the transposon and simultaneous inversion of a DNA segment which includes genetic material extending to one side from the site of the original insertion, i.e., part or the whole of the portion of the affected gene to one side of the site of the original insertion. Restoration of the affected gene to its original state can then occur only by precise deletion of the remaining part of the transposon together with re inversion of exactly the inverted DNA segment, i.e., by the coincidental occurrence of two events each of which is expected to be exceedingly infrequent, probably undetectably rare. The consequence of either of these two kinds of event, deletion or deletion plus inversion, occurring in a bacterium with a transposon insertion in a gene specifying a biosynthetic enzyme is to change the transposon containing antibiotic resistant auxotrophic bacterium with a genetic lesion causing an enzyme defect, which though complete is liable to rare reversion, to an antibiotic sensitive bacterium with the same enzyme defect, as before, absent the intact transposon, and now no longer subject to correction by rare reversion events. Thus when the transposon is inserted into a gene specifying an enzyme used in a biosynthetic pathway leading to a metabolite or metabolites essential to the bacterium for multiplication butnonavailable in its vertebrate host, the final result is a bacterial strain with a complete and non reverting mutation causing non virulence. Isolation of auxotrophic mutants can be facilitated by use of penicillin, to kill non auxotrophic bacteria and so increase the proportion of nutritionally exacting mutants in the population. Once a mutant with the desired auxotrophic character has been isolated a large population of the mutant can be screened for presence of any descendants able to grow without the relevant metabolite, thus testing the probability of reversion of the mutation this test is made more rigorous if the population is first exposed to a mutagenic agent, or agents, capable of inducing a wide variety of mutational changes, i.e., base substitutions, frameshifts, etc. Furthermore if a recombination system is available, a mutant with a deletion of a segment of a gene covering the sites of two or more point mutants can be recognized by the absence of wild type recombinants, when the deletion mutant is crossed with each of the point mutants in question. In these ways one can assure that the auxotrophic mutant investigated is almost certainly a result of deletion, rather than of point mutation. A general transducing phage, such as phage P1, able to adsorb to bacteria of a wide range of genera if necessary after appropriate genetic modification of their lipopolysaccharide character, to provide the necessary ability to adsorb this phage can be used to transduce a non functional biosynthetic gene, such as an Conjugation may also be employed involving conjugational crossing of a virulent strain with a a non virulent but amenable strain having the desired non reverting mutated gene. By employing an Hfr or F strain with an F virulent strain, transfer of the mutated gene to the virulent strain can occur with recombination resulting in the replacement of the wild gene by the mutated gene. One would then select for the auxotroph as described previously. The use of a transducing phage, DNA mediated transformation, and or conjugation may also be employed to successively introduce two or more independently mutated genes into a single host strain to be used as the vaccine. The presence of two completely independent mutations, each of which has an extremely low probability of reversion, provides almost absolute assurance that the vaccine strain cannot become virulent. In accordance with the subject invention, the vaccines are produced by introducing a non reverting mutation in at least two genes, where the mutation is of a sufficient number of bases in tandem to insure a substantially zero probability of reversion and assurance of the non expression of each mutated gene, in the sense of its total inability to determine production of an enzymically active protein. In addition, each gene chosen will be involved in one biosynthetic pathway to produce metabolites which are either infrequently present in the host or completely absent. The type of gene and number chosen will result in the likelihood that a host for the vaccine will provide the necessary nutrients for proliferation will have a probability approximating zero. These requirements have been shown to be fulfilled by the In the case of transduction, the transposon has a marker which allows for selection of the transduced microorganism. For example, if the transposon provides resistance to a biostat or biocide e.g. antibiotic, by growing the transduced microorganism in a nutrient medium containing the bioactive agent, one selects for the transductant strain. One can then employ other techniques, as will be described below, to select for members of the transductant strain which undergo excision of all or part of the transposon where the transposon carries with it a portion of the gene into which it had been integrated or results in an inversion of a portion of the gene. In order to isolate the auxotrophic strain, whether produced by transduction, mutagenesis, transformation or other means, it is desirable to provide selective pressure to the treated virulent strain to enhance the proportion of the desired auxotrophic strain. One technique is to employ a drug, e.g. a pencillin, which is only lethal to bacteria which are multiplying. By employing a nutrient medium which does not provide the metabolic product required by the auxotrophic strain due to the mutation introduced above, the auxotrophic strain will be inhibited from multiplying, while the virulent parent strain will multiply and so be killed by the pencillin. Normally, at least about 99 of the bacteria are killed and less than 100 , so that the surviving about 0.05 to 1 of the original bacteria have a greatly enhanced concentration of the auxotrophic strain. One can then grow the surviving bacteria in a supplemented medium which will allow for multiplication of the auxotrophic strain and repeat the penicillin killing process until one can isolate the auxotroph from a single colony and establish the complete absence of any of the virulent parent strain. The resulting auxotrophic strain will be a non virulent live vaccine, having the desired immunogenicity, in that the deletion will not affect the production of the antigens which trigger the natural immune response of the host. At the same time, the deletion results in a non virulent live vaccine, incapable of growing in the host and incapable of reverting to a virulent strain. Two particularly valuable strains having To provide for antigens of species other than the non virulent host, one or more genes coding for the desired antigens may be introduced into the host as expression cassettes, or for enzymes for synthesis of the desired antigen s . By expression cassette is intended transcriptional and translational initiation and termination regions bordering the structural gene of interest with the structural gene under the regulatory control of such regions, that is, properly spaced and being 5 and 3 to the structural gene, respectively. Where bacterial or bacteriophage structural genes are involved, the natural or wild type regulatory regions will usually, but not always, suffice. With structural genes from eukaryotes including viruses and occasionally with prokaryotes, the structural gene will be joined to regulatory regions recognized by the bacterial host. The expression cassette may be a construct or may be or form part of a naturally occurring plasmid such as the plasmid encoding the enzymes for production of the O specific part of the LPS of Structural genes of interest may come from diverse sources, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, metazoan parasites or the like. The structural genes may encode envelope proteins, capsid proteins, surface proteins, toxins, such as exotoxins or enterotoxins, or the genes of interest may specify proteins, enzymes or other proteins, needed for synthesis of a polysaccharide or olygosaccharide antigen or for modification of a saccharide containing antigen, such as LPS, of the host bacterial strain, or for synthesis of a polypeptide antigen, such as the capsular antigen of Specific genes of interest include those specifying the heat labile and heat stable enterotoxins of enterotoxigenic The construct or vector may be introduced into the host strain by any convenient means such as conjugation, e.g., F or hfr strain, transformation, e.g., Ca precipitated DNA, transfection, transduction, etc. Modified hosts may then be selected on selective medium employing the phenotype of the marker. The subject vaccines may be used in a wide variety of vertebrates. The subject vaccines will find particular use with mammals, such as man, and domestic animals. Domestic animals include bovine, ovine, porcine, equine, caprine, domestic fowl, Leporidate e.g., rabbits, or other animal which may be held in captivity or may be a vector for a disease affecting a domestic vertebrate. The manner of application of the vaccine may be varied widely, any of the conventional methods for administering a live vaccine being applicable. These include oral application, on a solid physiologically acceptable base, or in a physiologically acceptable dispersion, parenterally, by injection, or the like. The dosage of the vaccine number of bacteria, number of administrations will depend on route of administration and will vary according to the species to be protected. For mice, of weight 15 20g, a single dose of ca. 3 x 10⁵ live bacteria of a non reverting The formulations for the live vaccines may be varied widely, desirably the formulation providing an enhanced immunogenic response. The live vaccine may be provided on a sugar or bread cube, in buffered saline, in a physiologically acceptable oil vehicle, or the like. The following examples are reference examples. A live vaccine derived from a For the transduction, a high transducing mutant, HT105 1 Schmiger, Mo.I. Gen. Genet. 1972 The isolation of tetracycline sensitive variants is facilitated by the fact that tetracycline, at appropriate concentrations, prevents multiplication of tetracycline sensitive bacteria, but does not kill them, whereas penicillin kills multiplying bacteria but spares non multiplying bacteria. The technique of penicillin selection was used for isolation of tetracycline sensitive variants from the The The mice used were from a colony of the inbred line BALB c, Caesrarian derived and barrier maintained with a defined gut flora, in the Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine. The mice of this line have known high susceptibility to To test the immunizing ability of strain SL1452, the five survivors of i.p. injection were challenged seven weeks after vaccination by i.p. injection of about 5 x 10⁵ bacteria of strain SL1420 virulent ancestor strain . Four control mice not vaccinated died on days 4, 4, 4, and 5 after challenge. One of the five vaccinated mice died by A genetic marker character was then introduced into the vaccine strain SL1452 to allow for identification. Strain SL1452 was treated with a transducing phage grown on an Ten calves, aged two weeks, were given To test the protection conferred by vaccination, groups of calves aged five weeks, either non vaccinated controls or vaccinated twice with live All of 16 challenged control calves showed anorexia and depression 15 had diarrhea and 14 died. Of seven calves which had had two doses of live vaccine by the i.m. route, three had diarrhea after challenge, two became anorectic and depressed and one died. The differences between control calves and those i.m. vaccinated in respect of death 14 of 16 versus 1 of 7 and of anorexia and depression 16 of 16 versus 2 of 7 are statistically significant p probability less than 0.001 for each comparison . Of three calves which had had two doses of SL1479 live vaccine by oral route, two had diarrhea after challenge and one was anorectic and depressed none died. The differences between control and oral vaccinated calves in respect of deaths 14 of 16 versus 0 of 3 and of anorexia and depression 16 of 16 versus 1 of 3 are statistically significant p less than 0.01 for each comparison. The development of the Strain SL1363 was exposed to transducing phage grown on Strain SL1438 was given in different amounts to three groups of five mice i.p. from an overnight, 37 C, not shaken broth culture. None of the vaccinated mice showed any apparent ill effects, even from 3 x 16⁶ bacteria, the largest dose given. To test the immunizing ability of strain SL1438, the mice from the above experiment and also a control group of five non vaccinated mice were challenged 30 days after vaccination by i.p. injection of 3 x 10⁵ bacteria of strain SL1372 i.e. the virulent Five week old calves were then employed, either being vaccinated or non vaccinated as controls, to test the adequacy of the Each of the several steps of transduction was effected by use of a high transducing non lysogenizing derivative of phage P22 P22 HT105 1 Tetracycline resistant transductants were selected on Oxoid blood agar base, code CM55, supplemented with 25 µg ml tetracycline. For recipient strains deficient in aromatic biosynthesis, this medium was supplemented with 2,3 dihydroxybenzoic acid DBA , to allow synthesis of enterobactin which is required for capture of ferric iron. For selection of transductants of altered nutritional character, a simple defined medium supplemented with tryptophan and cystine requirements of wild type The transduction plates were inspected after 1,2,3 and 4 days of incubation, and colonies appearing in the drop areas were picked and purified by streaking out and selection of discrete colonies, on the same medium as that on which selection was made. In general, transductant colonies developed later, and in much smaller numbers, e.g., by a factor of 10³, in crosses in which the recipient was Introduction of the The 510Ty, 511Ty transductants was used as a recipient in a second transduction, using phage lysate G2013 grown on The first donor strain used was strain SL5173, which is The transductant was then treated with phage lysate G1715 grown on Strains SL5475 and SL5505 are both To introduce the Tetracycline sensitive mutants of 531Ty were obtained by spreading a diluted broth culture on a medium which hinders the growth of strains which are tetracycline resistant because of presence of Tn10 Bochner et al. 1980 J. Bacteriol. 143 926 . This medium was modified by addition of 2,3 dihydrobenzoic acid, at about 1 µg ml, because of the Vi negative mutants are obtained from 531Ty by streaking from colonies of phage resistant mutant bacteria developing in areas of lysis caused by application of Vi phage I, II adaptation A or E1 or IV, or a mixture of all four of these phages. The phage resistant mutants, after single colony reisolation were tested for presence or absence of Vi antigen by slide agglutination tests using commercially available anti Vi serum and by testing for sensitivity to each of the Vi specific phages. A mutant scoring Vi negative in both tests, and retaining its parental nutritional character and ancestral 0 antigenic character was designated 543Ty, and constituted as a Vi negative live vaccine strain. Both 541Ty and 543Ty were fed to volunteers with generally satisfactory results. There were no ill effects on any volunteer and some volunteers showed serological evidence of immune response. In addition, some volunteers excreted the vaccine strain for a day or two demonstrating at least short term viability.
