# POROUS POLYMERIC MATERIAL CONTAINING A REINFORCING AND HEAT SEALABLE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A highly prorous polymeric material which may be dry or contain an included liquid, for example, a cleaning composi tion, is reinforced and rendered heat sealable by the incorpora tion of thermoplastic fibrous, particulate or foraminous ma terial. The polymeric material is preferably a styrene homo or copolymer prepared by polymerisation of a high internal phase emulsion. Sheets of the porous polymer may be sandwiched between two liquid permeable substrate layers to form a wip ing cloth or the like.
