# A bacteria adsorbing composition.

## Abstract
A bacteria adsorbing composition which includes a first component comprising a powerfully hydrophobic, bacteria adsorbing, physiologically innocuous, preferably water insoluble material, and a second component comprising a hydrophilic, liquid absorbing, physiologically innocuous material in which a the hydrophilic material is present in the form of one more layers and the hydrophobic material is present in the form of one or more liquid permeable layers or is found ap plied to such a layer or layers, b the two materials are present in admixture with each other, preferably in the form of particles, or c the two compounds are conmbined chemically in one single substance which consists of a dry, particulate, water swellable polymer exhibiting hydrophobic groups.
