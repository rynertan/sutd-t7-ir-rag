The compounds useful in the present invention possess outstanding pre and post emergent herbicidal activity with respect to yellow and purple nutsedge, while having no significant adverse effects on many agronomic crops such as, for example, wheat, cotton, corn, peas, rice and peanuts. The instant compounds also exhibit excellent residual activity with respect to yellow and purple nutsedge weeks after treatment of soil containing nutsedge. The instant compounds are preferably employed in an amount of from about 1.0 to about 1.5 Ibs per acre when used as pre emergent herbicides, As post emergent herbicides, the compounds are preferably employed in an amount of from amount 1.5 to about 4.0 Ibs acre, more prefecably from about 3.0 to about 4.0 lbs acre. O course, the rates of application of the instant herbicides, either alone or in combination with one or rL0T0 other herbicides, will vary depending on the nature of the soil, nature of the crops, extent of weed control desired, and the like. If total vegetation control ts desired, rates of application of native compound in excess of 8 lbs acre are preferred. The compounds of this invention can conveniently be applied as pre emergence herbicides in the form either of liquid or granular compositions. and can be either applied directly to the soil or incorporated into the soil before planting. The compounds are generally crystalline or oily mathrin with only slight solubility in water, so that where liquid formulations are desired they can be compounded in the form of wettable powders or emulsifiable concentrates which can be readily diluted with water prior to application. The compounds can also be applied in the form of herbicidal dusts, and may be combined with fertilizers or other herbicidal substances such as the N,N dialkyl thiol carbamates.Suitable granular compositions can readily be prepared by dissolving the herbicidal Substance in a light organic solvent such as acetone and spraying the solution onto a carrier such as attapulgite, clay or vermiculite, the solvent tnen being removed by evaporation. Accordingly, this invention specifically provides for granular formulations of a novel compound of this invention together with a granular carrier material which can, tf desired also be a granular fertilizer material such as ammonium nitrate or urea prills . Suitable granular formulations are those containing from about 2 to 20 by weight of active ingredient uniformly dispersed on a dry granular carrier material such as attapulgite, clay, vermlculite or ground corn cobs. Salts of the acid compounds of the invention can generally be formulated by dissolving the salts in water, and stable salts within the scope of the invention constitute a preferred class of compounds. Emulsifiable concentrates can be formulated bye dissoLvi.ag the herbicidal compound in an organic solvent such as an aromatic oil which is rcadlly disporand in water , and it desired one or mo .e co solvents such as the high alcohols or ketones, or butryolactone can be used. Such concentrates are preferably formulated with wetting agents, and any suitable wetting agent, either anionic, cationic or nonionic may be employed. Suitable surfactants are the known anionic or nonionic particularly the latter surfactants customarily employed in formulating herbicidal materials. Examples of anionic surfactants are the.sulphonates such as the alkylbenzene sulphonates , the sulphated surfactants such as sulphated alcohols, acids, amines, esters and sulfated natural fats and oils , and the phosphate esters such as alkyl polyphosphate surfactants . Suitable nonionic materials include the polyoxyethylene surfactants such as the ethoxylated alkyl pnenols and the ethoxylated aliphatic alcohols and the carboxylic esters such as the poly ethylene glycol esters and the polyoxyetnylene fatty ac esters . The novel compounds of this invention can, if desired, ba used in comoination with or combined with other knoun herbicides. In particular, combinations of 2,6 dichlorobenzylideneaminooxyacetic acid and EPTC S ethyl dipropyl thiocarbamate have been found to be highly effective preferably as replant soil incorporation treatments for potatoes.Thus, this invention specifically provides the use of the novel compounds, especially 2,6 dichlorobenzylideneaminooxyacetic acid in combination with one or more known herbicides sch that for each part by weight of a noel compound there is also employed from about 0.25 to 4.0 parts by weight of a known herbicide such as chloramben, EPTC and the like . As noted above, the compounds and compositions of the instant invention may be utilizied as ptcemergence herbicides, post emergence herbicides and total vegetation control herbicides. One may utilize any prior art technique known to achieve the type of appliction desired such as, for example, incorporation in the soil, spraying, dusting, and the like.
