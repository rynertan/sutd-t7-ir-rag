# POLYPROPYLENE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING BIMODAL CALCIUM CARBONATE AND A POLYSILOXANE

## Abstract
Physical properties of filled polypropylene compositions are improved by using a calcium carbonate filler of bimodal particle size, e.g., a mean of 2 microns and a mean of 5 microns, and a polysiloxane additive. The compositions are useful as food containers.
