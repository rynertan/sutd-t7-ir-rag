# Heat pump.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a compression or absorption heatpump system with normal closed circuit a for the heat transport fluid, including an evaporator 7 for withdrawing heat from any type of cold water at a tempera ture between 0 C and approximately 10 C, forming the ambient heat source, in which system the heat transport fluid is in liquid phase at a temperature below 0 C when entering the evaporator, such that ice is formed on the outside of the evaporator. The evaporator 7 and the heat source water are both contained substantially without hav ing mutual contact in a vacuum vessel 8 at approximately 0.006 ata, so that triple point boiling and simultaneously ice formation in the water takes place. The vapor condenses and freezes in a desublimation process on the outside of the evaporator 7 , resulting in only about 12 of all ice being deposited on the evaporator and 88 formed in the water charge 9 as small crystals providing a pumpable suspen sion. This suspension is continuously and or periodically withdrawn from the vessel. Thus periodically only said 12 of all ice has to be removed from the evaporator. Preferably this is done by first indroducing a small water charge at an elevated temperature of about 35 C into the emptied vac uum vessel, giving such an intensive vapour production that the ice is melted off from the evaporator in short time. Thereafter the charge is supplemented continuously or periodically with cold wather 10 to start a next triple point cycle. Meanwhile the heatpump may be held in normal operation. The heat contained in the water charge at ele vated temperature has been taken from the closed circuit, after the fluid has left the condensor 4 in which it has delivered the production heat at the higher consumer tem perature. Thus remaining heat at lower temperature is used for the defrosting of the evaporator 7 by way of an addi tional water circuit d provided with an accumulator 19 .
