# Bottle cap.

## Abstract
A bottel cap of the tear off type, particularly an easy to open cap for wide mouth bottles, in which a central top wall which covers the top portion of the mouth of the bottle is connected to a lateral band which surrounds the opening of the neck of the bottle and is bent under the edge of the neck to grip the cap, and a tear off tab, bounded by one or more score lines, extends from the top wall through the lateral band and an angular sealing is interposed between the mouth of the bottle and the top wall and the lateral band. The score line or lines are located approximately at the bound line between the top wall and the lateral band and the angular sealing is bonded to the innermost surface of the lateral band at a bond area outside the score line or lines, whereby, when the cap is broken by lifting the central top wall by means of the tear off tab, the residual lateral band appears L shaped and the angular sealing is broken only at the tear tab. The sealing can also be bonded to the top wall at an extension of the bond area, bounded by the score line or lines towards the lateral band, to make the breaking of the sealing itself along with the tear tab easier at the time the opening of the cap is started.
