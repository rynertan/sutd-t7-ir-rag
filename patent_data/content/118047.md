# Multiplexed display interference compensator.

## Abstract
A multiplexed display interference compensation sys tem for minimizing the apparent intensity modulation of an oscilloscope waveform display caused by closely spaced, individually imperceptible interruptions of the waveform required to maintain refreshed readout display is provided. The system includes a charge pump circuit 6 for adding a current pulse to a waveform intensity control signal in response to a control signal from display multiplex control 4 so as to increase the waveform intensity just after the interruption.
