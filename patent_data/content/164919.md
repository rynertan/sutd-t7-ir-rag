# Barge tipper.

## Abstract
A barge tipper comprises a cylindrical floating apparatus 1 10 defining a chamber 18 into which a barge 28 can be floated. End doors 16 at either end of the apparatus 10 are closed and the barge 28 is clamped in position by hydraulically operated clamps 20 . Water is pumped from the chamber 18 to ballast tanks 12 and 14 , causing the apparatus to rotate and thus tipping the barge 28 . The contents of the barge 28 flow into a first conveyor 22 and are delivered to a second circumferential conveyor 24 which feeds the material to an external conveyor 26 .
