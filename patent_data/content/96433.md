# Method and apparatus for transporting and depositing viscous materials.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for transporting small quanti ties of viscous material and for depositing the viscous material on a substrate 11 by means of a transport pin formed by an ultrasonic sonotrode 3 . Two components of a two component adhesive may be supplied in small metered quantities A, B and intimately mixed and the mixture may be deposited on a substrate 11. Due to the fact that the two components are mixed only a short time before they are deposited on the substrate, the pot life of the mixture does not become a problem.
