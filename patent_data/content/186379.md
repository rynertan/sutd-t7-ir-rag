The DNA fragment coding for an insecticidal protein according to the present invention is derived from a plasmid pSY1 present in The plasmid pSY1 is isolated from the above mentioned strain according to a modification of the method described by Hansen and Olsen, As shown in Fig. 3, the plasmid pSY1 is cleaved with a restriction enzyme The plasmid pSX8 is cleaved with various kinds of restriction enzymes, and each of the DNA fragments thus obtained is ligated to a cloning vector pBR322 cleaved with the corresponding restriction enzyme. Each of the ligation mixtures is used to transform As The plasmid pSP801 is then cleaved with restriction enzymes The clone A nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment of about 2.95 kb corresponds to a nucleotide sequence at positions 1 to 2955 in Fig. 1 1 to 1 7. The DNA fragment consists of 2955 bases, in which 2802 bases from the positions 153 to 2954 encode 934 amino acids corresponding to the above mentioned polypeptide. Another part of the DNA fragment consisting of nucleotides from the positions 1 to 152 is a 5 non coding sequence. The nucleotide sequence is different from the nucleotide sequence disclosed by Wong et. al., The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is no means limited to, the following examples. Plasmid pSY1 was prepared from DNA was dissolved in 20 ml of a solution comprised of 20 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl ph 7.5 , and the solution was added with RNase A to a concentration of 0.1 mg ml, incubated at 37 C for two hours, extracted with phenol, and added with two volumes of ethanol to precipitate DNA. The precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml of a solution comprising 20 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 , and the solution was passed through a Biogel A 0.5 m T.M. column, and a void volume fraction was recovered. To this fraction, ethanol was added to precipitate DNA, which was then purified by density equilibrium centrifugation in ethidium bromide cesium chloride. The plasmid DNA thus obtained showed a single band under agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA of plasmid pSY1 was treated with restriction enzymes. The DNA was cleaved with In the plasmid construction described below, Cells of The route for the construction of plasmid pSX8 is shown in Fig. 3. The plasmid pSY1 was cleaved with a restriction enzyme The plasmid pSX8 was cleaved with a restriction enzyme As shown in Fig. 3, plasmid pSP801 was cleaved with To determine a location of gene coding for an insecticidal protein on the 6.6 kb insert of pSP801, deletion derivatives were constructed from pSP801 using the restriction sites indicated in Fig. 5. Each of these derivatives was used to transform Each of the clones was cultured, and tested for the production of an insecticidal protein by the radioimmunoassay described in paragraph 3 and bioassay described below in paragraph 9 . The results obtained from the above mentioned tests are summarized in Fig. 5, together with the result obtained from pSP801 and pLBT291. In Fig. 5, the left part of the drawing represents profiles of a region of each plasmid corresponding to the 6.6 kb The clones which were pronounced positive in the radioimmunoassay, i.e., The electrophoresis patterns are shown in Fig. 7, wherein lane 1 represents a product from a clone containing plasmid pLBT291, lane 2 represents that from pKB5, lane 3 represents that from pKA2, lane 4 represents that from pMR4, lane 5 represents that from pHP1, lane 6 represents that from pSP801, lane 7 represents that from pSX8, and lane 8 represents that from pBR322. Although the insecticidal protein produced by The above mentioned result shows that the In this connection, it should be noted that both the 75 kD polypeptide derived from pLBT291 and the 144 kD polypeptide derived from other plasmids react with the antibody against the insecticidal protein obtained from The extracts prepared as described in paragraph 8 from 1 ml of each extract was impregnated into 10 g of an artificial feed composition for silkworms, and the impregnated feed composition was put in a plastic container, into which five fifth instar silkworms were incorporated. The container was allowed to stand overnight, and the viability rate and an amount of increase of the body weight of the silkworms were determined. The results are set forth in the following table. As seen from the table, all of the silkworms which ate the feed impregnated with the extract prepared from It should be noted that the 75 kD polypeptide expressed by pLBT291 shows an insecticidal activity substantially identical to that of the 144 kD polypeptide which corresponds to the main polypeptide of the insecticidal crystal protein produced by The sequence of the The 2.95 kb DNA fragment was cleaved with restriction enzymes The nucleotide sequence thus determined is set forth in Fig. 1 1 to Fig. 1 10. The 5 kb DNA fragment consists of 5,002 bp, and contains a single large open reading frame starting from a starting codon ATG, wherein base A corresponds to the position 153 in the sequence in Fig. 1 1, and terminating at a stop codon TAA, wherein the last base A corresponds to the position 3,695 in the sequence in Fig. 1 8. The open reading frame consists of 3,540 bp, and is flanked by a 5 non translation sequence consisting of 152 bp, and by a 3 flanking sequence consisting of 1,310 bp. There is no other open reading frame corresponding to the molecular weight of the insecticidal protein. Therefore the 144 kD insecticidal polypeptide should be derived from the above mentioned open reading frame. The open reading frame consisting of 3,540 bp encodes 1180 amino acids. Therefore, the 144 kD insecticidal polypeptide is assumed to consist of 1180 amino acid residues starting from Met at the amino acid position 1 and terminating by Glu at the amino acid position 1180, which corresponds to 133,481 Dalton of the molecular weight. This amino acid sequence reveals that approximately half at the amino terminal side of the 144 kb insecticidal polypeptide contains much less lysine and cysteine than a carboxy terminal side does. In the large open reading frame, a nucleotide sequence starting from base A at position 153 and terminated by G at the position 2954, consisting of 2802 bases, corresponds to an open reading frame contained in the 2.95 kb An inverted repeat sequence capable of forming a stable stem and loop structure is found from the position 3782, which corresponds to about 100 bp downstream from the stop codon, to the position 3824, and assumed to act as a terminater on transcription. Moreover, an open reading frame reversely extending from the position 5002 to the position 4021 is found. According to the present invention, the insecticidal protein are provided in a water soluble form. Therefore, the protein can be easily separated and purified from the producer cells. This means that insecticidal compositions specific to Moreover, since Finally, the nucleotide sequences and plasmids of the present invention can be further manipulated or modified to construct improved nucleotide sequences or plasmids which will provide new polypeptides having stronger insecticidal activity.
