# Methods for producing single crystals in insulators.

## Abstract
A monocrystalline layer of silicon is formed on an insulating substrate according to the present invention by use of a semi insulating layer 2 between the insulator 1 and silicon film 5 . This semi insulating layer is composed of a mixture of silicon crystallites 3 embedded in a silicon dioxide glass 4 , for example. Such a technique results in a structure which is substantially free of cracking resulting from differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the insulating substrate and the monocrystalline silicon layer.
