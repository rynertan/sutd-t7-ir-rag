# Gas meter.

## Abstract
A gas meter is disclosed having a one way index 50 in corporated therein for causing the indicating means 20 the reof to run only in a forward direction regardless of the actual direction of gas flow. A pivoting member 64 is oscillated by a rotating cam 78 coupled to the measuring means of the me ter and includes pawls 70, 72, 74 attached thereto for driving a ratchet wheel 52 , coupled to the indicating 20 means, in one direction only. By this arrangement, the oscillation of the member 64 is independent of the direction of rotation of the cam 78 , which rotation is indicative of the direction of gas flow.
