# Rotating shaft pulse generating apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for generating electrical pulses in response to rotation of a shaft 40 . The apparatus incorporates an internal optical disc 56 carried by a hub 44 assembly attached to the operating shaft, with the hub assembly having a beveled bearing surface 68 at one end thereof for engaging a similarly beveled surface 66 of the apparatus housing 22 , and biasing means 72 for biasing the hub assembly 44 toward said housing beveled surface 68 to compensate for mechanical wear and to also minimize erratic movement of the optical disc 56 . The combination of a light emitting diode 98 and photo transistor 102 generate electrical signals in response to the blocking and transmitting of light through radially oriented opaque segments of the disc during rotation. The light emitting diodes 98 and phototransistors 102 are retained by receptacles 82 which snap fit within cooperating apertures of the housing. A second combination of light emitting diode 82 and photo transistor 102 , together with a second stationary disc 112 provide two phase shifted signals which can reduce problems caused by jitter, backlash and the like.
