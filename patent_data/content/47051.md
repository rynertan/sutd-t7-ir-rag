# Universal joints.

## Abstract
A universal joint comprises inner and outer drive members 12 and 14 with longitudinal drive grooves 24 and 28 which receive drive balls 16 for transferring torque between the members. The balls are positioned by a cage 18 which is pivoted on the inner and outer drive members about two respective centers C and D which are on opposite sides of and spaced from the cage center. The cage has a cylindrical surface 40 and two stop surfaces 38 and 42 inside the cage, permitting the inner drive member 12 to slide and pivot with respect to the cage for a limited distance, so providing either a limited plunge or a limited plunge of reduced resistance.
