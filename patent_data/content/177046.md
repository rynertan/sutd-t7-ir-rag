# LOOSE PARTS FILTER

## Abstract
A filter for arresting debris of a predetermined size range from a fluid path has a first face disposed transversely in the fluid path and a second face disposed substantially parallel to the first face and displaced therefrom in the direction of fluid flow. The displacement of the second face from the first face substantially defines the strength of the filter with respect to deformation by the fluid flow. The first and second faces cooperate to define a plurality of apertures extending through the filter. The apertures are of a size to preclude passage of the debris while presenting a predetermined resistance to the fluid flow. That predetermined resistance is substantially independent of the filter s strength.
