# Electrodes for electrolytic cells.

## Abstract
An electrode 10 for use in an electrolytic cell, and a method for producing same, wherein said electrode 10 comprises an internal copper conductor 18 and an external element 22 of a second metal, at least a portion of each having contact surfaces being held in intimate contact with the other, said conductor 18 and said element 22 each having a conductive coating 25 applied to the contact sur face, said conductive coating 25 comprising between about 20 and about 30 percent indium and between about 80 and about 70 percent gallium, whereby the contact resistance between said conductor 18 and said element 22 is reduced.
