# Vapor trap with regulator and method for cooling a super conductive turbogenerator.

## Abstract
A vapor trap for a superconductive generator having a liquid coolant supply pipe 44 that has interiorly located, a flow construction 76 , an annular liquid coolant dam, and means 74 for blocking the vapor flow through the central portion of the supply pipe 44 , act to prevent the coolant vapor within the generator from flowing back through the supply pipe.
