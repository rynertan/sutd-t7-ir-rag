# A steering system.

## Abstract
Two steerable wheels 30, 31 are coupled by a link 26 and operated by hydraulic actuators 12 and 13 with head chambers connected to a directional control valve 38 controlling the supply of hydraulic fluid from a pump 34 . The valve 38 is positioned in accordance with the pressure difference between control lines 48, 49 connected to a manually operated metering pump 50 . Feedback chambers on the rod sides of the pistons 14, 15 in the actuators 12, 13 are connected to the control lines 48, 49 . In order to overcome problems arising from different rates of flow into and out of the feedback chambers, the control lines 48, 49 are connected by a compensating valve 54 which bleeds off pressure from either control line 48,49 when the pressure difference between the lines becomes too great.
