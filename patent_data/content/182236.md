# Optical recording medium.

## Abstract
An optical recording medium comprising a substrate and an information recording layer which consists of monolayer as semblies comprising a photochromic compound of which is based on cis trans isomerization such as an amphipathic de rivative of azobenzene, indigo or thioindigo having a long chain substituent, which monolayers are formed on the substrate by the Langmuir Blodgett method and oriented in a two dimen sional plain. When the recording medium is irradiated by light, light absorption spectrum of the recording layer changes so that information is recorded. Since the photochromic com pound is oriented in a monolayer, its photochromism lasts long.
