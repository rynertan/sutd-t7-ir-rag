# Simethicone antacid tablet.

## Abstract
A tablet containing at least two separate and discrete volume portions one of which contains simethicone and the other of which contains antacid. A barrier separates the two volume portions to maintain the simethicone out of contact with the antacid and to prevent migration of the simethicone from its volume portion of the tablet into the volume portion containing the antacid, and vice versa. The simethicone is physically combined with the other ingredients of the tablet in such a manner that the simethicone is available relatively immediately for anti foaming action, and its availability does not depend upon the breakdown of a matrix.
