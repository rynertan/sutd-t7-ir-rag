# Storage tank having a floating roof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to floating roof storage tanks 1 , having a tank shell 2 which is supported on a fixed base 3 , and a floating roof 4 supported by the liquid 17 stored in the tank 1 . Included in the base 3 or roof 4 is a displacement means 18,51 to substantially displace the stored liquid 17 when the floating roof 4 is in its lowest position. In this way the volume of the heel of liquid 17 unable to be removed from the tank is reduced. The displacement means can take the form of a container 51 which protrudes downwardly from the roof 4 , or a layer of ballast on the base 3 of the tank. The ballast layer can be a liquid 18 heavier than the stored liquid 17 which can be retained in a dam 30,40 if desired.
