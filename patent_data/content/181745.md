## Description
Rotary Arm for a Seat Belt Forwarding Device This invention relates to a rotary arm for a seat belt forwarding device seat belt reacher device of a type in which an end of a seat belt is attached to a free end of the rotary arm which is adapted to be driven by a rotary unit, and in particular to such a rotary arm which will not be an obstacle in getting into the rear seat of the vehicle when the rotary arm is in its backwardly inclined position. It is proposed in European Patent ApplicationNo. of even filing date Agents Ref EL 31034 FEP 039 to facilitate the fastening of a seat belt by attaching an end of a seat belt to a free end of a rotary arm and forwardly rotating the rotary arm in response to the closing action of the door, but the rotary arm should not be an obstacle for a person in getting into the rear seat of the vehicle. In particular, when the rotary arm is in its backwardly inclined position, if the upper side surface of the rotary arm protrudes from the lower edge of the opening for the door, it will not only be an obstacle for a passenger in getting into the rear seat but also may be stepped upon by the passenger in the rear seat and it may cause a malfunction of the belt forwarding device. In view of such problems of a seat belt forwarding device, a primary object of this invention is to provide a rotary arm for a seat belt forwarding device according to which the upper side surface of the rotary arm will not protrude from the lower edge of a door opening when the rotary arm is in its backwardly inclined position. Another object of this invention is to provide a rotary arm for a seat belt forwarding device which is comfortable to wear as part of the seat belt. According to this invention, such objects are accomplished by providing a rotary arm for a seat belt forwarding device of a type in which an end of a seat belt is attached to a free end of the rotary arm which is adapted to be driven by a rotary unit, comprising a first portion which is adapted to be rotatively driven by the rotary unit and a second portion extending from the first portion a central axial line of the second portion being offset relative to a rotational axial line of the first portion on a plane perpendicular to the rotational axial line of the first portion in such a manner that the central axial line of the second portion may be located below the rotational axial line of the first portion when the rotary arm is in its backwardly inclined position. Thus, by positioning the second portion of the rotary arm to be lower than the first portion of the rotary arm when the rotary arm is in its backwardly inclined position, the upper side surface of the rotary arm will not protrude from the lower edge of the door opening. According to a certain aspect of the present invention, there is provided a rotary arm for a seat belt forwarding device wherein the second portion is hinged to the first portion in such a manner that the second portion may bend toward a wearer of a seat belt. Since the rotary arm can thus bend, at its middle part, towards the wearer of the seat belt, the rotary arm, as a part of the seat belt, will not apply uneven pressure to the wearer of the seat belt. The present invention will now be shown and described in the following in terms of concrete embodiments thereof with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a general perspective view of a seat belt forwarding device to which a rotary arm according to this invention is applied Figure 2 is a partly broken away side view of the rotary arm according to this invention Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along line III III of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a schematic side view of the rotary arm according to this invention in its backwardly inclined position and Figure 5 is a schematic side view of a rotary arm which is not based on the present invention in its backwardly inclined position. Figure 1 is a general perspective view of a seat belt forwarding device according to this invention.The seat belt 1 is attached to the free end of a rotary arm 4 after being taken out from a belt retractor 2 and passing through a through ring 3.When the door is open, the rotary arm 4 is in a backwardly inclined position as indicated by an arrowB and imaginary lines, and, as the door is closed, the rotary arm 4 rotates in a forwardly direction as indicated by an arrow A. A tongue plate 5 is attached to the seat belt 1 near its free end and, once the rotary arm 4 has inclined forwardly, a passenger seated in a seat 6 can readily engage the tongue plate 5 with a buckle 7 which is attached to the other side of the seat assembly. Since the seat belt 1 will be located in a position which is suitable for the passenger to fasten the seat belt, the use of the seat belt is effectively encouraged without giving him any constraining impression. It is possible to utilize drive sources of various types for driving the seat belt forwarding device, in particular its rotary arm, but, according to this embodiment, the force applied to the door to close it is transmitted to a rotary unit 8 which is connected to the rotary arm 4 by way of a control cable 9 whose one end is connected to a door checker not shown in the drawings provided in a door panel, as a pulling force of the control cable, and the rotary arm 4 is thus driven with the closing force applied to the door without using any other special drive source. Detailed description of the rotary unit will be found in the European Patent Application of even filing date mentioned above. Figures 2 and 3 show the rotary arm according to this invention. This rotary arm 4 comprises a first portion 10 and a second portion 11. Within the first portion 10, a first arm member 12 consisting of a metal plate is attached to the rotary unit 8 Figure 1 by way of a bolt 18 and a positioning pin 26. The first arm member 12 extends radially from the portion thereof surrounding the central bolt 18 and is then bent in a plane perpendicular to the axial line of the bolt 18. And a second arm member 14, which is located within the second portion 11, is connected to the free end of the first arm member 12 by way of a hinge pin 13 and extends along the same axial line as the free end of the first arm member 12.Therefore, when the rotary arm 4 is in its backwardly inclined position, the central line of the second portion 11 is offset to be lower than the bolt 18 which is the rotational center of the first arm member 12. Since the free end of the first arm member 12 is connected to second arm member 14 by way of the hinge pin 13, the second arm member 14 may rotate downwardly in the sense of Figure 3 or, in other words, toward the passenger when the rotary arm 4 is in its forwardly inclined position. The free end of the second arm member 14 is provided with an opening and resin 15 is molded around the free end to define an engagement opening 16 for engaging the free end of the seat belt 1. The first arm member 12 and the second arm member 14 are covered by a central casing 17 and a casing extension 20 which are integrally formed by, for instance, polypropylene. Numeral 19 denotes a plug plate for covering a hole provided in the central casing 17 for fastening the bolt 18. The casing extension 20 is provided with a polypropylene hinge 21, consisting a groove extending perpendicularly relative to the axial line of the casing extension, adjacent to the hinge pin 13 and notches 20c on both side ends of the casing extension 20 adjacent to the polypropylene hinge 21, so that the casing extension 20 may be freely bent relative to the central casing 17 according to the hinge motion of the second arm member 14 relative to the first arm member 12. The central casing 17 is fixedly secured with the first arm member 12 by the bolt 18, and the casing extension 20, provided with inwardly projecting ribs 20a and 20b, is fixed relative to the first and the second arm members 12 and 14 with the ribs 20a and 20b engaging free ends 22a and 25a of retaining members 22 and 25 which are fixedly secured to the arm members by rivets 23 and 24. An extension 22b provided in the base end of the retaining member 22 serves as a stopper which prevents the second arm member 14 from rotating upwardly in the sense of Figure 3 or, in other words, away from the passenger when the arm 4 in its forwardly inclined position. Figure 5 shows a case in which a normal arm 4 , which is not based on the present invention, is used with the seat belt forwarding device and, since the main portion of the rotary arm 4 protrude8 from the lower edge 27 of the door opening, it may become an obstacle for a passenger in getting into the rear seat and may become a cause of a failure of the seat belt forwarding device by being stepped onto by the passenger. Figure 4 shows a case in which the rotary arm 4 according to this invention is used with the seat belt forwarding device and, according to this rotary arm, since the second portion is offset relative to the first portion so that the second portion may be lower than the first portion, the rotary arm will not protrude from the lower edge 27 of the door opening, and not only the rotary arm 4 will not obstruct the passenger from getting into and out of the rear seat but also the rotary arm will not be damaged by being stepped thereonto. Although Figure 4 refers to a case in which the vehicle is a two door passenger car and a seat back 6a of the front seat 6 inclines forwardly as indicated by an arrow a when a passenger is to get into the rear sear, the present invention may also be applied to other vehicles including four door passenger cars. Thus, according to this invention, since the usability of the seat belt forwarding device can be improved by providing an offset to the shape of the rotary arm 4 and preventing it from becoming an obstacle in getting into the vehicle, its effect is substantial.
