# Double end stud.

## Abstract
A double end stud 30 has a shank member including a central slide shank portion 10 and threaded portions 20A, 20B formed coaxially on both axial ends of the slide shank portion 10 . The threaded portions 20A, 20B are externally threaded in opposite directions. The double end stud 30 also has a nut member 41 carried by the slide shank portion 10 of the shank member slidably in the axial direction but not rotatably with respect to the slide shank portion 10 , in use, the nut portion 41 is moved axially as the threaded portions 20A, 20B are screwed into female a thread portions 50A, 50B of the two structural members A and B to be connected, so that the depth of penetration of the double end stud into both structural members are opti mized to ensure a high strength of connection between these structural members.
