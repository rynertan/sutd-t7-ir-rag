# Method for the fluorescent detection of damaged DNA and kit for use therein.

## Abstract
A sensitive method for detecting damage to DNA, e.g. re sulting from exposure of living cells or whole organisms to low doses of radiation or chemicals, is described comprising par tial lysis of exposed cells to access the DNA alkaline denatur ing the DNA after a selected interval stopping the denatura tion by lowering the pH to a selected value rendering the ly sate homogeneous adding an appropriate fluorescent dye which interacts preferentially with double stranded DNA and measuring the resulting fluorescence. The decrease in fluores cence compared to that before denaturation is a measure of the rate of DNA denaturation which is directly proportional to the extent of DNA damage. Several factors, particularly the lowered pH at which the denaturation is stopped, have been found important for increased sensitivity. The method is suita ble for monitoring the effect on DNA in living cells of environ mental factors, drug and radiation therapy, and for toxicology studies. A kit adapted for carrying out the test method is des cribed.
