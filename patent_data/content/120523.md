# Improved splicer device to splice textile yarns mechanically.

## Abstract
This invention concerns an improved splicer 10 to splice textile yarns mechanically, the splice being obtained by coupl ing two single untwisted yarns 70 71 and reapplying the twists thereafter, part of such single yarns 70 71 being untwisted until twists of a sign opposite to the original twists have been imparted, such part then being doubled and remaining tails 270 271 being obtained, the doubled tract being then retwisted by imparting a required value of twist, which splicer 10 comprises plate means 14 15 with untwisting and retwisting ring means 58 59 cooperating at least momentarily with retwisting means 60 61 , means to couple yarns, means 32 132 to pluck and or tear excessive tail ends 170 171 , means 79 to clamp twists in the tracts of yarn 70 71 not to be torn, and inner clamping means 78 acting at least momentarily on two yarns 70 71 , the splicer 10 being characterized by comprising yarn coupling means 72 73 consisting of a pair of means which approach each other at least momentarily, twist balancing means 55 which act at least momentarily on excessive tail ends 170 171 , means 75 to cause the approach of remaining tails 270 271 , which bring the remaining tails 270 271 close to the adjacent whole yarns 71 70 , and plucking and or tearing means 32 132 which act directly in a direction along the axis of the excessive tail ends 170 171 at least momentarily.
