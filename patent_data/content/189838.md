# Thermal stabilization of alpha amylase.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for enhancing the thermal stability of microbial alpha amylase. The method involves adding a stabilizing amount of an amphiphile to the enzyme in its aqueous solution. Also included within the scope of the invention is the stabilized alpha amylase formulation and its use in the liquefaction of starch.
