# Separation of methane rich gas, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from mixtures with light hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A process for separating a gas stream rich with both carbon dioxide and compounds heavier than ethane such as the gas from enhanced oil recovery and recovering separate streams of cabon dioxide sales gas consisting of nitrogen, methane and ethane, and a liquid natural gas condensate. This process comprises the steps of an extractive distillation which utilizes a hydrocarbon mixture such as naphtha as the solvent and an absorption desorption step using as the sol vent a mixture of dialkyl ethers of polyalkylene glycols.

## Description
This invention relates to a process for separating mixtures containing light hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans and carbonyl sulfide. More particularly, this invention relates to an integrated process for recovering a separate stream of fuel grade natural gas which is mainly methane with some quantities of nitrogen, ethane and smaller quantities of carbon dioxide, a separate stream of propane and heavier hydrocarbons, and a separate stream of carbon dioxide. Still more particularly, such a gas having a heating value between 500 and 1300 Btu per standard cubic foot, known as sales gas , is separated from its original mixture with carbon dioxide and other compounds such as ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane and heavier hydrocarbons.The heavier hydrocarbons are sometimes referred to as tPG 1 or NGt while the original gas may be referred to in commerce as an associated gas or separator gas. The said sales gas stream of this process is virtually free of hydrogen sulfide. The process of this invention also encompasses within its scope the recovery as a separate stream most of the carbon dioxide that is present in the original mixture. By practicing this process, a stream of carbon dioxide is obtained which is substantially free of hydrogen sulfide. In most instances by controlling the process variable carbon dioxide streams of sufficient purity and properties subitable for reinjection into petroleum oil reservoirs are recovered. Briefly state, the process of this invention encompasses two main steps. In the first step, Step I, the original associated gas, after drying to water dew point of 60 F., is subjected to absorption stripping under a moderate pressure between 200 psia and 800 psia and within the temperature range of about 20 F. to about 40to. at the top of the absorber stripper. One such absorber stripper is described here as the DECOTIZER . The solvent for the absorption stripping in the first column can be any hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons which has a boiling range between about 120OF. and about 400OF. and which as a freezing point lower than about 20 F. Such a solvent may comprise a paraffin such as any hexane, heptane, octane, dodecane, etc., or mixtures thereof or preferably, a mixture such as but not limited to heavy naphtha or any gasoline, kerosine, or jet fuel.These compounds and mixtures are readily available from a gas processing plant. Olefines may also be suitable.These include for example, any heptene, or naphthas resulting from a cracking or a pyrolysis process. In the second step, Step II, the overhead gas from the absorber stripper of Step I is separated into a carbon dioxide rich stream and a methane rich stream.The preferred separation of Step II is to absorb the carbon dioxide from the overhead stream from the first column of Step I in a solvent as described below. The methane rich sales gas is thus rendered practically free of carbon dioxide and can be made to meet any required specifications. In a further step of Step II, the carbon dioxide, with possible traces of ethane, if the latter is present in the original stream, is recovered from the solvent. The conditions for operating the present process can be readily varied to control the distribution of ethane among the three streams, i.e. the composition of the sales gas, the purity of the carbon dioxide and the composition of the decotizer s bottom stream the latter containing most of the ethane from the original associated gas and virtually all of the propane and heavier hydrocarbons. An added feature of the process is that it also provides for the control of the distribution of the hydrogen sulfide. The solvent for absorbing the carbon dioxide inStep IZ can be any of the physical solvent. The term physical solvent as used herein refers to a solvent which absorbs the carbon dioxide without depending on a chemical reaction with said gas. Preferably such a solvent requires little energy for regeneration from Step II while recovering the carbon dioxide. Hence, the most preferred solvent is a polymer containing repeating units of Rl 0 n R2 groups, where R1 is a portion of cH2 nt chain and R2 is a chain ended with a CH2OH terminal group andRand R2 represent alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the physical solvents useful in the practice of this invention include dialkyl ether of polyalkylene glycols and the solvents described in U.S.Patent 3,737,392 are particularly suitable. The preferred solvent is a mixture of polymers of the glycol family described above having an average molecular weight between 200 and 1000 and the atmospheric bubble point varying between about 300OF. and about 600 P. An example of such a solvent is a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols having the general formula CH3O C2H40 xCH3 wherÃ« in x is 3 9 and the molecular homolog distribution in terms of x is Molecular homolog, wt. percent 3 4 9 4 2 2 2 4 5 24 28 6 2 0 2 2 7 13 15 8 6 8 9 2 4 and available from Norton Company, Worcester, MA 01606 under the trademark SELEXOL. The instant process is advantageous over other known processes such as those described by A. S. Holmes et al, Pilot Tests prove Ryan Holmes Cryogenic Acid GasProcess , Gas Processors Association, Dallas, Texas March 15 17, 1982 , Page 5 A. S. Holmes et al U.S.Patent 4,293,322 October 6, 1981 , and A. S. Holmes et al U.S. Patent 4,318,723 March 9, 1982 by virtue of the high temperature in the absorber stripper of Step I.It utilizes a different processing scheme and different solvents, requires less severe refrigeration, and offers flexibility in controlling the heating value of the as gas and the concentration of nitrogen and methane in the recovered carbon dioxide.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 diagrammatically illustrates the process of this invention. Figure 2a diagrammatically illustrates the separation of carbon dioxide and sales gas, and ethane and LPG from natural gas liquids. Figure 2b diagrammatically illustrates the separation recovery of carbon dioxide and sales gas. As described hereinabove, the process of this invention comprises two steps. In Step I, the dehydrated dewatered associated gas under a moderate pressure and at a temperature between about 0 F. and about 100OF., as stream 11, enters the absorber stripper DECOTIZER column 13 at a point in the bottom part of said column, which is equipped with an overhead condenser 15 and a reboiler 25 and internals such as trays, or packing or any device which can be or is utilized commercially for the purpose of contacting and separating vapors and liquids in absorption or distillation. A variety of these packings are available under the brand INTALOX from Norton Company, Worcester, MA.The number of trays or equivalents thereof may vary from case to case but the preferred number may be between 5 and 100 with the more preferred number being about 30. The cooling medium for condenser 15 is selected to maintain a temperature level between about 20 F. and about t 40 F. Such a level can be maintained by many commercially available refrigerants such as, but not limited to propane, butane, ammonia and fluorocarbons, etc. A solvent stream 17 is fed either into the condenser 15 or onto a tray in the top section of said column, or through the liquid distributor at the top section of a packed column. The associated gas is then subjected to absorption stripping whereby the light components, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and some ethane are separated as the overhead stream 21 while a large portion of the ethane as well as virtually all the propane and heavier hydrocarbons as well as hydrogen sulfide are collected at the bottom as stream 27. The absorption stripping can be done with or without reflux and with or without reboiling. Reboiling, if it is required, is provided by the reboiler 25. The compositions of streams 21 and 27 leaving column 13 are controlled by varying the solvent tofeed rates, the temperatures of streams 17 and 21, and the pressure level in column 13. For example, the bottom stream 27 from column 13 of Step I is fed into a distillation column 29 for recovering ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane and butane in the form of overhead stream 37. The composition of stream 37 is controlled by the temperature and rate of the reflux stream 35 from the condenser 33. Reboiling is provided by a reboiler 45. Either the entire bottom stream 39 or a portion thereof 41 is cooled by exchanging heat with stream 27 in a heat exchanger 43. The solvent stream, stream 41, is thus cooled.Stream 23, can be separated from the pentanes and some of the heavier hydrocarbons of the original associated gas in another distillation column not shown in Figure 1 , and is reused as the solvent, stream 17. The overhead gas stream 21, from the first column of Step I, column 13, which contains practically all the nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and some of the ethane of the original associated gas , is separated in Step II, into sales gas, stream 77, which is virtually methane, with some nitrogen, ethane and an allowable trace of carbon dioxide. In this step, a separate carbon dioxide rich stream with some ethane and traces of methane, stream 99, is also recovered. The solvent absorption stripping set up of Step II can be one of any existing or commercially available processes. In the diagram shown as Figure 1, a standard SEIssEXOL process, D. K. Judd, SELEXOL Unit Saves Energy , HydrocarbonProcessing, April 1978, Pages 122 124 for absorption recovery of carbon dioxide, is utilized.Thus, the lean solvent , as stream 73, is introduced onto a tray or through a distributor in the top section of the absorber 67 where it contacts the gas 65, which is rich with carbon dioxide, the latter being the product of flashing a carbon dioxide rich, stream 53, into a separator drum 57. The absorber exchanger 55 together with the separator drum 57 provides for recovering a gas stream rich with carbon dioxide from bottoms 51 of the absorber 67 and the overhead stream 21 from column 13 of Step I as well as recycled carbon dioxide recompressed to an intermediate pressure, stream 49. Stream 59, from separator drum 57 containing the solvent and is rich in carbon dioxide is subjected to a series of expansions in expanders as shown in Figure 1 by units 61, 80, 82 and 84 each of which is followed by its respective separation drum 79, 81, 83, and 85.Resulting from these consecutive expensions, carbon dioxide is released as vapor streams 49, 87, 89, and 91 each at different pressure. While stream 49 is recycled, the original quantity of the carbon dioxide in stream 21 is now divided into several streams and can be compressed, if so desired, in compression stages 93, 95, and 97 and recombined to constitute stream 99, the regenerated carbon dioxide under pressure. Stream 37, which may contain hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and either methyl or ethyl mercaptan, or some of both can be further treated by any conventional method to remove these contaminants. In order to illustrate the practice of this invention the following Example is included. EXAMPLE I In a process as shown schematically on Figures 2a and 2b, a feed gas stream, described in Table I as stream Sll, is fed onto the fifth tray, counting from the reboiler, of column 13 comprising a reboiler 23, trays and a condenser. Stream 517 which is called the recycled solvent is fed into the condenser 15 of column 13 continuously and simultaneously with the feeding of stream Sll. The column operates under an overhead pressure of 500 psia.The products from this absorption stripping operation are a vapor stream S21 which contains virtually all the carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane of the original feed stream 511 and some of the ethane, and a liquid stream 527 which contains virtually all the propane and heavier hydrocarbons, and most of the ethane. The reflux ratio is 4 1 in this run. In a further step, bottom stream S27 from column 13 is fed onto tray 8, counted from the reboiler, of distillation column 29, which comprises a reboiler 25, twelve distillation trays and a condenser 33, where it is distilled to produce a vapor stream 537 which contains virtually all the ethane, propane and butanes. The bottom liquid stream S39 from column 29 comprises pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons with traces of carbon dioxide and butanes. Part of stream 539, and stream 541 are recycled and reused as the solvent 517 after cooling in exchanger 19 and in condenser 15 where it is returned into column 13 in combination with the reflux. The other part of stream 539 is a natural gas condensate product. The compositions of the streams resulting from such as operation under reflux at the ratio of 4 1 are also given in Table 1. Stream S21, the vapor product from column 13 is subjected to absorption desorption and recovery of carbon dioxide and sales gas with SELEXOL being used as sol vent as shown in Figure 2b. The results from Step II, of the process, shown in Table 2, indicates that a stream 899 which is virtually pure carbon dioxide, 98.54 mole , and a sales gas stream, S77, with only 0.37 mole carbon dioxide is recovered from an original stream 511 which is rich with carbon dioxide by practice of this invention.
