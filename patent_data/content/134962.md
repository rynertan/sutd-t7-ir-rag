# DATA ACQUISITION CIRCUITRY FOR USE IN COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A digital acquisition system for use in a computerized radiation tomography system employs track and hold means associated with each channel of the radiation detector in the tomography system. Each channel of the radiation detector is connected to a voltage follower transistor and resistor. A signal from the voltage follower transistor and resistor is applied through a Butterworth filter and amplifier to a transconductance amplifier which provides a signal for application to a charge storage capacitor. The capacitor is connected to the detector channel except during each limited period of time when the charge is held for measurement and conversion to a digital form. The data acquisition system has fewer components, and the simplicity of the circuitry in creases the circuit reliability.
