# Gas turbine combustor.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a gas turbine combustor 3 which produces a little amount of NOx. The combustor 3 has a head combustion chamber 11 and a rear combustion chamber 12 which is larger in diameter than the head combustion chamber 11 . The head combustion chamber 11 is provided with an axially extending hollow frustoconic al tubular member 13 to form an annular combustion space therein, air holes for axially jetting air into the annular combustion chamber, air holes formed on the peripheral wall for injecting air and a plurality of fuel nozzles 22 projected into the annular combustion space for injecting fuel into vortex formed by the air jet and the injected air flow whereby the flame is stabilized and lean combustion can be performed. The rear combustion chamber 12 has a fuel and air supply means on the upstream side which consists of air inlets formed by whirling vanes and fuel nozzles disposed in the air inlets so that fuel and air are mixed well. The fuel and air mixture is jetted substantially axially while whirling it so that hot spot formation is avoided, NOx formation is limited extremely.
