# Method of, and apparatus for, detecting leaks.

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, detecting leaks from a surface provides a sampling device 10 making use of an air curtain C . The body 11 of the device 10 , the curtain C and a surface B to be tested together define a sample volume S . Pressure in the sample volume S is regulated to draw signal gas from a source thereof to the volume S along leak path L which exists. Sampled gas is withdrawn from the volume for checking by means of a mass spectro meter 18 for the presence of signal gas.
