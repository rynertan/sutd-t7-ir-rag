## Description
BICYCLO OCTATRIENE DERIVATIVES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING THEM AND PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THEIRPRODUCTION This invention concerns certain pharmaceuticallyactive compounds, processes for their preparation, and compositions containing them. Certain cyclobutene derivatives are described, e.g. inBritish Patent Specification No. 1,042,197, as being of use as intermediates for use in the production of medicaments and also as having analgesic properties. We have now found that a particular group of aminomethyl bicyclo octatrienes possess unexpected properties in that they can influence the functioning of the cardiovascular system. In one aspect, this invention provides the bicyclo t4.2.0 octa 1,3,5 triene 7 methanamines of formula I,EMI1.1 in which one of A, B and D represents hydrogen and the other two independently represent CH2OR or OR, R represents hydrogen or phenylalkyl, and R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each represent hydrogen, alkyl or unsubstituted or substituted phenylalkyl, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In another aspect, this invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein a bicyclo 4.2.0 octa 1,3,5 triene of formula II,EMI2.1 in which one of AÚ, BÚ and DÚ represents hydrogen and the other two independently represent CHO, CH2ORÚ or ORÚ, RÚ represents a blocking group or a group R as defined above, and Q represents CH2NR2R3, CN or CONR where R andR3 are as defined above, provided that R1 does not represent hydrogen when Q represents CH2NR2R3, is reduced or hydrolysed to give the corresponding compound of formula I, and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or vice versa. When Q represents CN, the resulting compound of formula I is one in which R2 and R3 both represent hydrogen. The reduction of the group Q may be effected by any appropriate means, for example by means of borane, lithium aluminium hydride, sulphuretted sodium borohydride or catalytically using hydrogen, e.g. in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Alternatively, where Q represents a group CONR 2R3, aluminium hydride may be employed.The non catalytic reduction of a group 0 is preferably carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. diethyl ether, glyme, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran. The reduction preferably takes place at a temperature of from 0 to 1000C and also preferably in the presence of excess reducing agent. The reduction of the groups CH2ORÚ or ORÚ where RÚ represents a blocking group, e.g. benzyl, may be effected by any suitable method, e.g. catalytically using hydrogen e.g. at 1 to 4 atmospheres pressure over a palladium charcoal catalyst and in the presence of a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions e.g. ethanol or acetic acid. The reduction of a group Q and AÚ, BÚ or DÚ, may, if desired by carried out simultaneously.When a blocking group or a group R is removed from a compound of formula II the process may be reduction or hydrolysis. The hydrolysis may be carried out using an acid, e.g. HC1, HBr or HI and at a temperature of from 0 to 2000, preferably 10 to 1000C. Alternatively the hydrolysis may be effected by means of a boron trihalide, e.g. boron tribromide or boron trichloride, at a temperature of from 80 to lOO0C and preferably in the presence of a chlorocarbon solvent, e.g.dichloroethane, chloroform or dichloromethane. The compounds of formula II, some of which are new compounds, e.g. when R1 represents benzyl, may be pre 23 pared, where Q represents a group CONR R , by a process in which a bicyclo 4.2.0 octa 1,3,5 triene of the formulaIII,EMI4.1 in which A1, B1 and D1 are as defined above, and Hal represents halogen, e.g. chlorine or bromine, is reacted with an amine of the formula R2R3NH. The compounds of formula III, some of which are new compounds, e.g. when R1 represents benzyl, may be prepared by a process in which a bicyclo 4.2.0locta l,3,5 triene 7 carboxylic acid of the formula IV,EMI4.2 in which A1, B1 and D1 are as defined above, is halogenated by means of a suitable halogenating agent. The halogenating agent may be, for example, a thionyl halide SOHal2, a phosphorus halide PHal5, or a phosphoryl halide POHal3. The reaction is conveniently effected in an appropriate solvent medium, e.g. toluene or 1,2 dichloroethane. The bicyclo 4.2.0 octa l,3,5 triene 7 carboxamides of formula II may alternatively be prepared in one stage from the compounds of formula IV by reaction with dicyclohexyl carbodiimide,or a suitable dehydrating coupling reagent, and the appropriate amine R2R3NH in which R2 and R3 are as defined above. The 7 carboxylic acids of formula IV, some of which are new compounds, may be prepared by hyrolysis of the corresponding compound of formula II in which Q is CN. The hydrolysis is conveniently effected by means of an alkali metal base, e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide, suitably in an appropriate solvent medium, e.g. ethanol. The compounds of formula II in which Q is CN, some of which are new compounds, may be prepared by a process in which a compound of the formula V,EMI5.1 in which A1, B1, D1 and Hal are as defined above, is subjected to the action of a strong base to give the desired compound. The strong base is conveniently an alkali metal amide or alkoxide or an alkyl alkali metal e.g. butyl lithium, sodium amide, lithium diethylamide, lithium di isopropylamide or potassium t butoxide. The compounds of formula V are either known or may be made from known compounds using conventional processes known per se. In the production of above intermediates it may be necessary or desirable to protect any formyl group which is present during one or more of the steps. Compounds of formula II in which one of the substituents is a formyl group may also be made by the process disclosed in Example 7 or processes analagous thereto. Once prepared the compounds of formula I may be converted into other compounds of formula I, especially where different groups R2 and or R3 are desired, by methods known per se. Acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting the free compound of formula I with the appropriate acid. The free compounds of formula I may be regenerated from the acid addition salts by reaction with an appropriate base. This invention naturally extends to the compounds of formula I and the acid addition salts thereof whenever prepared by a process as described. The salts of the compounds of formula I are preferably those formed with a mineral or organic acid having a physiologically acceptable anion, e.g. a hydrohalic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydriodic acid, citric acid or tartaric acid. The compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals, in particular they act on peripheral and or central dopaminergic receptors. As such, they lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate and increase blood flow to contain vascular beds, e.g. the kidneys. The compounds also have an action on other adrenoreceptors, and these exhibit a positive inotropic effect. Activity of the compounds has been observed in the following assay systems a canine renal blood flow, McNay and Goldberg, J. Pharmac, Exp. Ther., 151, 23 31, 1966. b rabbit isolated ear artery, McCullogh, Rand and Story, Br. J. Pharmac, 49, 141 142, 1973, and c cat nictitating membrane, Gyorgy and Doda, Arch, Int. Pharmacodyn, 226, 194 206, 1977. The compounds of the invention are indicated for use in the treatment of congestive heart failure, renal failure, angina pectoris, ischaemic heart disease and hypertension, hyperprolactinaemia and also in Parkinson s disease, and other neurological disorders. The dosage administered will naturally depend on the compound employed, the mode of administration and the desired effect. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered at a dosage of from 0.05g to 10mug per kilogram of body weight per day. For man, the indicated total daily dosage is in the range 2.5jug to 300mg, which may be administered in divided doses for example 2 to 6 times a day, or in sustained release form. Thus unit dose forms may comprise from about lpg to 200mg of the compound. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are advantageous in that they possess a different spectrum of activities, e.g. they possess less undesirable side effects, have advantageous absoption profile, are more potent, are more active and possess other desirable properties as compared to structurally similar compounds. We prefer A or B to be hydrogen and the remaining pair of A, B and D to be OR. R preferably represents hydrogen. R2 and or R3 are preferably hydrogen or alkyl C 1 to 6, especially C 1 to 4, for example methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or butyl, When R, R2 and or R3 represents phenylalkyl, the alkyl moiety is preferably C 1 to 4 and especially C 1 or 2, e.g. benzyl. Where the phenylalkyl group is substituted, the substituent group s are preferably alkyl or alkoxy, preferably C 1 to 4, e.g.methyl, ethyl, methoxy or ethoxy halogen, e.g. chlorine or bromine, or nitro groups, e.g. 3,4 dimethoxyphenylethyl. Specifically preferred compounds of formula I are those of Examples 5 and 6, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably less than 80 , and more preferably less than 50 by weight of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets, capsules and drags microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, diatomaceous earth, a sugar such as lactose, dextrose or mannitol, talc, stearic acid, starch, sodium bicarbonate and or gelatin for suppositories, natural or hardened oils or waxes and for inhalation compositions, coarse lactose. The compound of formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably is in a form having a mass median diameter of from 0.01 to 10 microns.The compositions may also contain suitable preserving, stabilising and wetting agents, solubilizers, sweetening and colouring agents and flavourings. The compositions may, if desired, be formulated in sustained release form. We prefer compositions which are designed to be taken oesophageally and to release their contents in the gastrointestinal tract. The compounds of formula I are asymetric and may therefore exist in the form of two optical isomers or a racemic or other mixture of such isomers. The various optical isomers may be resolved, wholly or partially, using conventional techniques, e.g. formation of a salt with an optically active acid, fractional crystallisation of the salt and subsequent regeneration of the free base. In another aspect the invention provides a method of increasing the force of contraction of the heart in an animal, either human or non human, which method comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention.
