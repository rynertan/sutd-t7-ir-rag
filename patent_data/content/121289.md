## Description
This invention relates to negative temperature coefficient NTC electrical devices, these being devices which become less electrically resistive with increasing temperature. Known NTC devices such as thermistors may be made from the oxides of such mater ials as iron, chromium, manganese, cobalt and nickel doped by the addition of small quantities of a metal with a different valency. The invention provides an NTC electrical device having as an NTC element an electrically conductive material produced by oxidative doping of a 2 substit uted pyrrole. It is known that electrically conductive materials can be produced by oxidation of pyrrole which results in the formation of an electrically charged polymer or oligomer inherently capable of conducting electricity.A negative counter ion is required to balance the positive electrical charge on the oxidised electrically conductive pyrrole material. This counter ion will be hereinafter referred to as a dopant , and the process of oxidation and introduction of the dopant will be referred to as oxidative doping , regardless of whether the doping is performed together with, or after, the oxidation. Examples of dopants include BF Br p toluenesulphonate. It has now been found that 2 substituted pyrroles when subjected to oxidative doping produce electrically conductive materials of surprisingly high negative temperature coefficient, which are accordingly useful in making NTC electrical devices. The preferred 2 substituents are electron releasing groups, preferably lower alkyl groups, especially methyl, although other more expensive substituents may be useful. Further substitution in the 3 , 4 or 5 positions of the pyrrole also produces high negative temperature coefficients compared with 3,4 disubstitution or unsubstituted pyrrole, the preferred 3 , 4 , or 5 substituents also being electron donating groups, preferably lower alkyl groups, especially methyl. Electrically conductive materials produced from pyrroles tend to have advantageous oxidation resistance over other conductive polymers such as polyacetylenes. To obtain a conductive polymer, sufficient positions must be left unsubstituted to permit polymerisation. Electrically conductive polymers are generally believed to operate by way of a conjugated pi electron system, and it will be understood that some substituents or combinations of substituents may interfere with the conjugated system so as to detract from or destroy the desired electrical conductivity, acceptable substituents being readily determinable by simply testing the conductivity of the resulting polymer. It is however not essential that the conductive material be a true polymer or oligomer, provided that it displays the required NTC effect.For example, oxidative doping of 2,5 dimethyl pyrrole can produce a black powder which is not readily identifiable as a polymer, but has the strong NTC effect aforementioned. The products of oxidative doping of 2,3 dimethyl pyrrole, 2,4 dimethyl pyrrole and 2 methyl pyrrole have the aforementioned NTC effect are believed to be new materials which are accordingly claimed per se together with their lower alkyl homologues as part of the present invention. Chemical preparative methods are preferred for producing the conductive materials of this invention.The 2 substituted pyrrole and the dopant are mixed with an oxidising agent in a suitable liauid vehicle. The oxidising agent can advantageously be carried by the dopant, for example by forming the ferric salt of a dopant such as p toluenesulphonate or halide ions, thereby bringing about simultaneous oxidative polymerisation and doping with the negatively charged dopant.Some oxidation reactions tend to produce an insoluble product, which is relatively non conductive, and a soluble product which, alone or in a mixture with the insoluble product, displays the marked NTC behaviour on which the present invention is based. Some specific examples of the present invention will now be described.Preparation of methyl pyrroles 2,5 dimethyl pyrrole is commercially available.The remaining methyl pyrroles 2 methyl 2,3 dimethyl 2,4 dimethyl and 3,4 dimethyl were synthesised by known literature methods.Oxidation of the methyl pyrroles All the methyl pyrroles can be oxidised by metal salt ox id ants such as ferric perchlorate to brown or black conductive powders. With the exception of 2,5 dimethyl pyrrole, chlorine can also be used to oxidise the methyl pyrroles.Example 1Oxidation of 2,5 dimethyl pyrrole by Ferric chloride 10g of 2,5 dimethylpyrrole was added dropwise with stirring to 300 cm3 of 60 w v aqueous ferric chloride solution. After 24 hours the precipitate was filtered off. Residual ferric and ferrous chloride was removed by dissolving the product in water and passing it through ion exchange columns. The product was dried under reduced pressure to give a dark brown powder.Typical analysis 15 20 wt. Cl 0.4 0.98 wt. Fe 17 218 wt. water.Example 2Oxidation of 2,4 dimethyl pyrrole by Chlorine 5 cm3 of 2,4 dimethylpyrrole and 150 cm of acetonitrile were placed in a conical flask and chlorine gas was bubbled through for two hours. The solvent was removed by evaporation to give a black powder. The powder consisted of two fractions a insoluble in acetonitrile and b soluble in acetonitrile and most other common organic solvents such as dichloromethane and methanol. The relative proportions of a and b could be varied by the amount of chlorine admitted, higher doses favoring the insoluble fraction a .Typical analysis Total chlorine wt Chloride wt Nitrogen wt Fraction a 26 5 9.73 Fraction b 33 10 10.73Example 3 Example 2 was repeated substituting 2 methyl pyrrole for the 2,4 dimethylpyrrole.Example 4 Example 2 was repeated substituting 2,3 dimethylpyrrole for the 2,4 dimethylpyrrole.Electrical Conductivity Measurements The pyrrole samples were compressed into pellets 1.3cm diameter using a SPECAC Powder Jig. The powder was preheated in the jig to about 140 C then loaded under pressure ca. 40 kgcm for 5 minutes. Upon cooling, the compressed sample was removed, checked for quality, and measured on a digital multimeter by locating the pellet between spring loaded circular copper electrodes in a 2 probe configuration. Conductivity vs. temperature curves were obtained by placing the device in a temperature programmable oven. The results are shown in the accompanying drawing. The NTC effect of oxidatively doped 2 methyl pyrrole, 2,4 dimethyl pyrrole and 2,5 dimethyl pyrrole is shown graphically compared with the very much less significant NTC effect of oxidatively doped 3,4 dimethyl pyrrole.Unsubstituted pyrrole produces a substantially zero temperature coefficient, which could be plotted as a substantially horizontal line on this graph. It may be advantageous to use mixtures of the 2 substituted pyrroles with one another or with other pyrroles. For example, oxidative doping of a mixture of a 2 substituted pyrrole with unsubstituted pyrrole has been found to achieve an NTC effect comparable with that of the 2 substituted pyrrole itself, while considerably raising the conductivity lowering the resistivity of the resulting material. Example 5 Mixture of Pyrrole and 2,4 dimethylpyrrole 1.41g of pyrrole and 0.86g of 2.4 dimethyl pyrrole 7 3 mole ratio were dissolved in 25ml of carbon tetrachloride. To this mixture was added dropwise 25mls of a solution of chlorine in carbon tetrachloride 0.12mol chlorine . An exothermic reaction ensued and a black precipitate was formed. The precipitate was filtered off and dried under recived pressure.
