## Abstract
A hydro pneumatic positioner 10 for a trailer 1 for the support and transport of a wing engine 2 , to be used for the removal or installation of the wing engines of aircrafts or the like, comprising a basic structure 3 fixed to four air cushion devices 4 , and supporting, by means of four hydraulic lifting cylinders or jacks 5 and 6 and hoisting chains 9 , a frame 7 for the support of the trailer 1 and of the engine 2 . The front cylinders 5 of said hydraulic cylinders 5 and 6 are fixed to the basic structure 3 , while the rear cylinders 6 can be selectively simultaneously brought and held in vertical position, or turned over to contact the ground by means of a third pair of double acting hydraulic cylinders or jacks 8 . The basic structure 3 also houses or supports the hydraulic and pneumatic devices for the actuation of the positioner mechanisms the adjustment devices for control means and protection means and at least on air supply pipe to be connected to an external compressed air source.
