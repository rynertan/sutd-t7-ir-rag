# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A valve assembly for permitting flow in a first direction and for preventing flow in a second, opposite direction includes a resilient flow regulator 54 having a pair of lips arranged in a converging relationship to define a normally closed slit 62 at the outer ends of the lips. A housing outlet portion 50 defines a housing interior approximating the shape of the regulator. The housing outlet portion further includes an annular collar 76 disposed outwardly adjacent the base of each planar surface 70 . The regulator is disposed within the housing outlet portion with an annular flange 66 thereof contained within the collar 76 and with the lips being adjacent to, but not in contact with, the interior housing surface. A cover plate 84 is attached to the collar for securing the regulator 54 and for sealing the housing. Bevelled surfaces 78 along the housing interior engage the regulator flange 66 for centering the regulator within the housing. Alignment tabs 68 are provided on each regulator lip for cooperating with recesses 80 in the planar surfaces 70 of the housing outlet portion. Alignment notches 82 are provided within the collar, one of which cooperates with an alignment key 92 formed on the inlet portion cover plate 84 .
