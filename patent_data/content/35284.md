TITLE NOVEL 2 BENZOYL 3 SUBSTITUTED 2 ALKENONITRILES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION This invention relates to novel substituted 2 benzoyl 3 substituted 2 alkenonitriles, which are useful as intermediates for the preparation of certain substituted cis 2 benzoyl 3 hydroxy 2 alkenonitriles which possess antiinflammatory activity, as described in our European PatentApplication 0016277A Serial No. 79301687.4 from which the present application is divided. According to the invention there is provided substituted 2 benxoyl 3 substituted 2 alkenonitriles of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Y represents the group OR or the groupEMI1.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each individually selected from hydrogen, halogen, alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl and trichloromethyl, with the proviso that at least two of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 must be hydrogen R6 is alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms R is alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R and R are each hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or R and R taken together with the associated nitrogen is pyrrolidino, piperidino, morpholino, thiomorpholino or N methyl piperazino.Halogen is exemplified by fluoro, chloro and bromo. In an embodiment of the invention Y is OR, all of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are hydrogen and the other groups are as defined in Formula I. In another embodiment of the invention, in the compounds of Formula I, R6 is methyl, Y is OR and H, H1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined forFormula I, but at least one of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 is other than hydrogen. The compounds of Formula I are new organic compounds and, moreparticularly, novel substituted 2 benzoyl 3 alkoxy 2 alkenonitriles i and novel substituted 2 benzoyl 3 amino 2 alkenonitriles ii which may be represented by the following structural formulae EMI2.1 wherein the groups are as defined above for Formula I. The novel compounds of Formula I are obtainable as crystalline materials having characteristic melting points and absorption spectra. They are appreciably soluble in many organic solvents such as lower alkanols, acetone, ethyl acetate, and the like but are generally insoluble in water. The preparation of the novel compounds of the present invention and their conversion to useful final products is set forth in the following reaction scheme wherein H1, H2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R, R and R are as hereinbefore defined for Formula I.EMI3.1 In accordance with this reaction scheme, an appropriately substituted benzoylacetonitrile iii is condensed with a trialkyl orthoester iv in ref fluxing acetic anhydride.
