## Description
IMPROVED CO .IBINATION TYPE DRYER FOR TEXTILE SHEET MATERIALS BACE .GROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improved combinationtype dryer for textile sheet materials, and more particularly relates to improvement in heating system on a combinationtype dryer for textile sheet materials such as elongated woven or knitted cloths, which is made up of an upper side short loop dryer and a lower side tenter dryer. Strain and elongation develop bi directionally on textile sheet materials after wet treatment such as drying, scouring and resin coating. Such strain and elongation have to be removed during the drying in order to enable smooth and trouble free cutting and sewing of them for apparel purposes. On a known combination type dryer of the above described type, drying of a textile sheet material is carried on during its continuous travel through the upper side short loop dryer, whereas shrinkage of the textile sheet material caused by such drying is compensated in the lower side tenter dryer in order to provide the textile sheet material with soft touch, brilliance and a longitudinally unifort prescribed width. The upper side short loop dryer and the lower side tenter dryer are in general thermally separated from each other by an insulating bulkhead so that the two chambers are separately controlled in temperature. The interior of the upper side short loop dryer is in general kept at a temperature from 120 to 1300 C, whereas the lower side tenter dryer at a teperature from 180 to 200 C. On a conventional combination type dryer, the heating medium such as high temperature gas supplied into the tenter dryer is discharged outside the system after heating of the textile sheet material travelling through the chamber. This eventuates in waste of thermal energy only which otherwise could be utilized further.SUMMARY OF THE IDNEItEIOIT It is the object of the present invention to efficiently re utilize the thermal energy already used for the textile sheet material travelling through the lower side tenter dryer on a combination type dryer. In accordance with the basic aspect of the present invention, the heating medium supplied into the lover side tenter dryer is re collected after heating of the textile sheet material travelling therethrough, and, after removal of harmful inclusions such as tar, supplied into the upper side short lop dryer.BRIEF DE3CRIPTION OF THE DRA fIÃ¬IGS Fig. 1A is a side view, partly in section, of one embodiment of the combination type dryer in accordance viith the present invention, Fig. 1B is a plan view of the combination type.dryer shown in Fig. 1A, Pigs. 2 and 3 are side view, partly in section, of embodiments of the disposable cassette type filter used for the combination type dryer in accordance with the present invention, and Fig. 4 is a sectional plan view of a like cassette type filter.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRE7DRRED S ,IBODIMENTS Pigs. 1A and 1B depict one embodiment of the combination type dryer in accordance with the present invention, which includes, as the major components, an upper side short loop dryer 10, a lower side tenter dryer 20 arranged below the short loop dryer 10, a heating medium transferer 30 thermally connecting both dryers 10 and 20, and a heat supplier 40 and a ventilator 50 annexed to the short loop dryer 10. Both dryers 10 and 20 are elongated in the travelling direction of a textile sheet material TSM, i.e. from left to right in the illustration. The short loop and tenter dryers 10 and 20 are defined by a box type hollow housing 1 and separated from each other by means of an insulating bulkhead 2. Both dryers 10 and 20 are provided with openings 11 and 21 formed in the one longitudinal end of the housing 1 having dimensions sufficient for allowing free entrance of the textile sheet material TS.I. A further opening 23 is formed in the other longitudinal end of the housing 1 for free leave of the textile sheet material T5M from the tenter dryer 20. Laterally facing the travelling path of the textile sheet material Tali, a number of heat emanator elements 12 are arranged in the short loop dryer 10 at adequate intervals along the travelling path. The heat emanator elements 12 are connected, via ducts 41 and 42, to a heat supplied 40 arranged on the housing. Likewise, a number of heat emanator elements 22 are arranged, laterally facing the travelling path of the textile sheet material T3M, at adequate intervals along the travelling path. The heat emanator elements 12 are connected to a give heat supply source not shown . The heating medium transferer 30 includes a horizontal collector pipe 31 having several taker in ends 32 opening in the tenter chamber 20, a vertical duct 33 connecting the collector pipe 31 to a fan assembly 34 mounted atop the housing 1. A further duct 36 is arranged atop the housing 1 for connecting the fan assembly 34 to distribution pipes 37 each of which has a blow out end 38 opening in the short loop dryer 10, preferably facing each heat emanator element 12. Although only two distribution pipes 37 are shown in the drawings each path two blow out ends 38, the number of the distribution pipes 37 and that of the blow out ends 38 per each distribution pipe 37 can be both designed freely in accordance with requirement in practice. Preferably, the collector pipe 31 extends almost over the entire length of the tenter dryer 20 end has talrer in ends 32 at different sections in the tenter dryer 20 so that the heating medium prevailing in the tenter dryer 20 can be collected uniformly. Although the taker in ends 32 are located at a same level in the tenter dryer 20, their levels may differ from each other for further uniform collection of the heating medium. Same can be said for the blow out ends 38 of the distribution pipe 37. The ventilator 50 includes a fan assembly 51 mounted atop the housing 1, and a ventilation duct 52 opening in the short leep dryer 10 and connected to the fan assembly 51. As described already, the heating medium once used in the tentering dryer 20 is re utilized for drying of the textile sheet material in the short loop dryer 10. High temperature heating of the textile sheet material in the tentering dryer 20 tends to drive harmful substances such as tar into the ambient heating medium out of the textile sheet material. For safe heating of the textile sheet material in the short loop dryer 10 by the heating medium passed from the tenering dryer 20, such harmful inclusions have to be removed off the heating medium during its transfer. For this purpose, the fan assembly 34 used for the present invention should include a filter placed in the passage of the heating medium. For free and easy replacement after contamination, the filter should preferably be of a disposable aessette type. One embodiment of such a disposable cassette type filter is shown in Fig. 2, in which the filter 60 includes a casing 61, and an number of angularly corrugated filter elements 62 which extend in the axial direction of the casing 61 and are somewhat spaced from each other. Each filter element 62 may take the form of a mixture of asbestos with pulp which is suited for collecting tar included in the heating medium. A valiant shown in rig. 3 includes like filter elements 63 but corrugated roundly. A further variant shown in Fig. 4 includes a core 64 and a number of concentrically arranged annular filter elements 66. In either case, the heating medium flows in the axial direction through the filter and harmful inclusions such as tar are collected by the filter elements out of the processed heating medium during its travel through the filter.Needless to say, other types of filters available on market are well usable for this purpose. The textile sheet material TSM passed from the preceding process station is introduced, via the first group of rollers 3, into the short loop chamber 10 through the opening 11 and subjected to drying at a temperature from 120 to 130 C. The heating medium from the heat supplier 40 and that transferred from the tentering dryer 20 take past in this drying. After sufficient drying, the textile sheet material GSM is pull out of the short loop dryer 10 by means of the second group of rollers 4 and introduced into the tentering dryer 20 by means of the third group of rollers 5 for tentering at a temperature from 180 to 2000 C. During the above described process, the high temperature heating medium in the tentering dryer 20 is collected by the collector pipes 31, passed to the fan assembly 34 for removal of the harmful inclusion suc as tar via the vertieal duct 33, passed to the distribution pipes 37 via the duct 36, and sullied into the short loop dryer 10 via the blow out ends 38. In accordance vdth the present invention, re utilization of the heating medium ventilated from the tentering dryer greatly contibutes to saving of thermal energy, thereby lowering the running cost of the dryer. Use of the disposable oassette type filter for purification assures constant, reliable supply of the heating medium into the short loop dryer.
