# Modular element particularly for false ceilings, partition surfaces and non structural walls.

## Abstract
This modular element is particular suitable for equipping false ceilings, partition surfaces and non structural walls in general. The element comprises a main body 2 having, on its outer surface 6 a pair of male connection elements 7 and a corresponding pair of countershaped female connection ele ments 8 . Each of the male connection elements 7 compris es a flat ribbing 9 extending from the outer surface 6 of the main body and has, on an edge thereof opposite to the outer face, a substantially cylindrical enlargement 15 , while each of the female connection elements 8 comprises a tubular lug 18 having its longitudinal axis parallel to the enlargement 15 of the male connection element. The lug of the female connection element, on a side thereof opposite to the outer surface 6 has a longitudinal slit 23 extending from an open end of the lug for accommodating the ribbing of an adjacent modular element.
