# A method of resolving optical isomers of 2,2 dimethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and a novel salt used in this method.

## Abstract
A method of preparing 1R,cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid useful as the acid part of effective insecticidal esters comprises reacting 2,2 dimethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid containing 70 or more of the cis form with an equimolar or lesser amount of 1 phenyl 2 p tolyl ethylamine, separat ing and, if necessary, purifying the resulting diastereomer salt, which is a new compound and decomposing said salt with a base or an acid to yield 1R,cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 2,2 dichlorovinyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. The correspond ing 1S,cis acid may be obtained by using 1 phenyl 2 p tolyl ethylamine.
