# Optical focusing system.

## Abstract
An improved optical focusing system is provided which includes a parabolic reflector 12 and a fresnel lens 14 situated with respect to one another to share a common focal point 16 . The system is designed to collimate substantially all of the available light emitted from a light source 18 located at the common focal point and project the light along a projecting axis 20 . Depending on the limitations placed upon the size of the parabolic reflector, a retroreflector 22 situated about the periphery of the fresnel lens can be added to the system to maximize the amount of emitted light which the system can collect and collimate.
