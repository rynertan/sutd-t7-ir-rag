## Description
This invention relates to a connector assembly including a frame defining a reference surface, locating means formed at the reference surface, an electrical circuit assembled to the reference surface, a spring member associated with the frame and actuating means movably mounted to the frame in engagement with and for moving the spring member relative to the reference surface. A flexible printed circuit is composed of an array of flexible electrical conductors mounted to a flexible electrically insulating support structure or ribbon. Such flexible printed circuits are used to electrically interconnect various components and subassemblies of electronic equipment such as computers, digital printers, video terminals, etc. Because they are flexible, these circuits can be routed along sinuous courses to effect such interconnections. In one application with which we are primarily concerned here, such flexible printed circuits are used to releasably interconnect different printed circuit boards within a piece of electronic equipment. Accordingly, connectors are provided at the opposite ends of the flexible printed circuit. Each connector usually consists of stamped contacts captured in a plastic housing, each contact being connected to a conductor in the printed circuit. That connector is then coupled to a mating connector mounted to the printed circuit board and whose contacts connect with various printed circuit paths on that board. When the connectors are coupled together, their contacts touch or interfit, thereby establishing electrical connections between the end of the flexible printed circuit and the PC board. Needless to say, the termination of flexible printed circuits in this fashion is a time consuming and expensive proposition. The connectors have to be mounted to the opposite ends of the flexible circuit and connections have to be made between the various circuit conductors and the connector contacts by soldering, wirewrapping, or the like. The same thing has to be done with the mating connectors on the PC boards. Further, as a result of their construction, the prior connectors are relatively large and bulky. Therefore, they limit the number of printed circuit boards that can be packed in a given volume inside the electronic equipment. In other words, PC boards are normally arranged parallel to one another in rows or stacks and the prior connectors of this general type, because of their size, limit the minimum distance between adjacent boards. Another problem with prior circuit assemblies of this type stems from the fact that the coupling of the flexible circuit connector to the mating connector on the PC board requires that a coupling force be applied which sometimes stresses the board to the extent that other circuit paths on the board are interrupted or damaged. Also, some prior connection assemblies do not provide adequate strain relief for the flexible circuit and some do not maintain reliable electrical connections between the circuit and the PC board when the assembly is subjected to vibration and shock. There do exist prior connectors for flexible circuits and interconnect cables which do not require a mating connector on the PC board. One such device is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,025,142. In that arrangement, a connector is mounted to the end of the flexible printed circuit and the circuit conductors are electrically connected to the connector terminals. The connector is designed to be positioned flush against a PC board so that its terminals make contact with exposed pads on the board that terminate the board conductors. The connector is held against the board by a clamp which engages over the connector and clips to openings in the PC board. That arrangement still has the disadvantage of requiring connections between each flexible circuit conductor and the connector. Also, that prior connector is rather bulky so that it limits the minimum distance between adjacent PC boards in a board stack. Still further, it is a relatively complicated and costly item to manufacture because it is composed of stamped metal terminals encased in a molded plastic housing. We are also aware of an assembly for connecting a flexible circuit to a PC board wherein the flexible circuit conductors are coupled directly to the PC board termination pads thereby eliminating the need for the connector to include contacts or terminals. Such an assembly is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,054,348. Basically, the connector is a clamp member which clamps the flexible circuit contacts to the electrical pads or contacts of a PC board. The end of the flexible circuit is inserted through a slot in the connector so that the circuit contacts are exposed at the underside of the connector. Then, a pair of feet at the opposite ends of the connector are inserted through appropriate openings in the PC board near the edge thereof and the connector is pressed flush against the PC board so that the circuit and board contacts touch. A clip at the edge of the connector engages over the edge of the PC board, thereby locking the unit in place. While that arrangement avoids the problems inherent in assemblies requiring mating connectors, it still has some disadvantages which limit its wider use and application. For example, the connector has to be installed on edge. Therefore, it limits the minimum spacing between adjacent PC boards in a stack. Also, it is difficult to insert and manipulate the connector to its locked position in a confined space. Further, the PC board conductors must be terminated adjacent an edge of the board. Moreover, when making the connection to the PC board, it is necessary to press the connector tightly against the board. This may result in bending of the board with possible damage to the board. Also, that connector does not account for variations in the thicknesses of the materials comprising the two circuits so that its fit may not always be correct. Resultantly, it may impart undue bending stresses to the board or result in a poor connection along one or another of the conductive paths between the two circuits. A connector assembly having features corresponding to the features mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 is known from US A 4 252 392. This connector assembly comprises a one piece stamped and formed metal clip provided with a number of cantilever springs which serve to press conductors on a first circuit against conductors on a second circuit, which conductors are aligned to each other. Each spring of the one piece stamped clip has a fixed end, a reverse bend and a spring arm portion. A single lifting member formed of stiff wire is provided allowing to lift all springs simultaneously, in order that the second circuit or cable can be inserted under zero insertion force, so that the cable conductors can be placed in electrical contact with the circuit board conductors. Therefore, for the known connector clip for connecting spaced apart cable conductors to circuit board conductors a rather high corresponding number of cantilever springs is necessary. Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide an improved flexible circuit connector assembly. Another object of the invention is to provide an assembly which establishes a reliable electrical and mechanical connection between a flexible printed circuit or cable and another circuit such as a PC board or a second flexible printed circuit. A further object of the invention is to provide a connector assembly which requires no mating connector on the circuit to which the flexible circuit is coupled. Another object of the invention is to provide a flexible printed circuit assembly which requires no soldering, wiring or special tools in order to effect the connection between the two circuits. A further object is to provide a flexible circuit connector assembly which provides strain relief for the flexible circuit. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a flexible circuit connector which is small and compact so that, when several such connectors are coupled to PC boards in a board stack, minimal clearance space is required between the adjacent boards in the stack. Still another object of the invention is to provide a connector which is relatively easy and inexpensive to manufacture and assemble. A further object of the invention is to provide an electrical connector of this general type which applies just the right coupling force between the flexible circuit and the other circuit to achieve reliable electrical and mechanical connections without unduly stressing the two circuits. Another object is to provide such a connector which is easy to use so that connections can be made at locations out of the assembler s line of sight. Yet another object is to provide a connector which facilitates making custom terminations for special PC board designs. Other objects will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, appear hereinafter. The solution of the invention is defined by the subject of claim 1. More specific embodiments are subject of the subclaims. Briefly, in the present assembly, an array of exposed electrical contacts at the end of a flexible printed circuit are clamped directly to a corresponding array of exposed electrical termination pads of another circuit by means of a contactless clamping mechanical connector. The connector comprises a frame having a reference surface to which is affixed the end of the flexible printed circuit so that the circuit contacts are exposed at the underside of the frame. Locating means on the frame and PC board properly locate the connector and its circuit relative to the PC board so that the circuit contacts are in register with the board termination pads or contacts. A spring member is supported on the frame. This member includes a pair of spaced apart arms which extend more or less perpendicular to the frame s reference surface. Corresponding first ends of the arms are located adjacent to the reference surface and are formed as hooks. Corresponding second ends of the arms are interconnected by a bridging segment that is spaced more or less parallel from the reference surface. The spring member is arranged on the frame so that, when its bridging segment is deflected from its normal relaxed position toward the reference surface, the free ends of the arms are spread apart and extended from the connector frame. On the other hand, when the bridging segment is deflected from its relaxed position away from the reference surface, the arm ends are retracted on the frame and draw toward one another. The connector also includes an actuator movably mounted to the frame so as to engage the bridging segment of the spring member. The actuator is movable between a releasing position wherein it deflects the spring toward the reference surface and a locking position wherein it deflects the spring away from the reference surface. Accordingly, such movement of the actuator extends and retracts the spring arms as aforesaid. When the actuator is positioned between these two extremes, the spring member assumes its normal relaxed position. In use, the flexible circuit is coupled mechanically and electrically to the PC board or other circuit by juxtaposing the connector to the PC board using the coacting locating means on the two circuits. The connector s actuator is then moved to its releasing position which spreads apart and extends the hooked ends of the spring member arms. Apertures are formed in the circuit being coupled to which register with the arm hooks when the two circuits are properly positioned relative to one another. Accordingly, the arm hooks can project through those apertures. Then the connector s actuator is moved to its intermediate position which allows the spring member to assume its relaxed condition so that its arm hooks draw toward one another. In so doing, they engage under the inboard walls of the board apertures. Finally, the actuator is moved to its locking position. Such movement deflects the spring member bridging segment away from the reference surface. Resultantly, the arm ends are retracted on the frame so that the connector and its circuit are clamped firmly to the PC board. The arm ends are also urged toward one another, thereby assuring firm engagements of the arm hooks in the board apertures. Furthermore, energy is stored in the spring member to compensate for variations in the PC board thickness, thermal distortions and other variables which may affect the distance between the underside of the PC board and the connector reference surface. This assures that the two circuits are tightly clamped together and remain so even when subjected to vibration and shock. In one preferred connector embodiment to be described in detail later, the aforesaid clamping action causes the corresponding contacts of the two circuits to actually wipe against one another further assuring that those connections are mechanically intimate and thus offer negligible resistance to the current passing through the circuit conductors. When the connector is coupled to the PC board as aforesaid, the flexible circuit contacts underlying the connector are pressed tightly against the PC board contacts. This high pressure contact breaks through any surface oxidation that may exist on the engaging contacts, thereby assuring very reliable, gas tight, metal to metal connections between the two circuits. Since the present connector is, in reality, a mechanical clamp which locates the contacts of a flexible circuit relative the contacts of another circuit and then applies the requisite coupling pressure to clamp the two circuits together, the connector can be much smaller and less weighty than conventional connectors of this general type. As will be discussed in more detail later, the locating means on the connector accurately locate the contacts of the flexible circuit relative to the connector. They also help to provide strain relief for the flexible circuit. Those same means correctly position the connector relative to the PC board thereby facilitating out of sight assembly of the connector to that board. Moreover, during such assembly, substantially no force is applied to the board as might tend to unduly stress the board and damage the circuit paths thereon. Furthermore, due to its mode of connecting to the PC board, the present connector can connect to any location on that board. It can also be designed to the specific application assuring that just the proper amount of clamping pressure is obtained. In other words, the connector components can be scaled as needed depending upon the size of the circuits being connected and the number of contacts to be connected. Also, since the connector s contacts are comprised of the flexible circuit itself, any changes in the termination pattern can be made quite inexpensively simply by modifying the pattern on the flexible circuit. Such changes do not involve any expensive retooling of the connector itself. Finally, because the present connector assembly comprises relatively few components which can be manufactured quite inexpensively in quantity, the overall cost of the assembly is kept to a minimum. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates a vertical stack of three connector assemblies made in accordance with this invention, each such assembly being indicated generally at 10. The uppermost assembly is shown disconnected the remaining two assemblies 10 are connected. Each assembly 10 comprises a flexible printed circuit or interconnect cable indicated generally at 12, a second circuit being connected to, namely a PC board 14 and a connector shown generally at 16. As best seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the flexible circuit 12 comprises an electrically insulating substrate 22 which supports a pattern of printed conductors 24. Each conductor 24 is terminated by a contact 24 Board 14 is also of more or less standard construction. It comprises a rigid insulating substrate 26 upon which is printed a pattern of electrical conductors 28. These conductors are terminated by a series of termination pads 28 Still referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, connector 16 comprises an elongated, generally rectangular frame or body 34 preferably molded of a suitable strong, impact resistant plastic material such as glass filled polyester. The underside of frame 34 is formed as a reference surface 36 to which the end of the printed circuit 12 is affixed by an appropriate cement or by other means. Surface 36 is generally flat. However, it may be formed with small nubbles not shown at locations underlying flexible circuit contacts 24 Locating means in the form of small posts 38 extend down from the opposite ends of the reference surface 36. These posts are dimensioned and positioned on the frame 34 such that, when the connector is positioned on the PC board with the circuit contacts 24 Preferably, the flexible circuit 12 is wider than the distance between posts 38 and the circuit substrate 22 is formed with semi circular edge openings or notches 40 FIG. 2 aligned with the circuit contacts 24 A generally C shaped spring member 42 is engaged around the frame 34. Spring member 42 has a pair of spaced apart generally parallel legs 42 Mounted to frame 34 in engagement with spring member 42 is an actuator shown generally at 46. The actuator includes a lever 48 which extends from the top of the frame 34. When the lever 48 is in its raised position as shown in the uppermost assembly 10 in FIG. 1 and in FIG. 2, the actuator 46 causes the spring member arms 42 Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 4, the spring member 42 is actually engaged in a groove or slot 52 extending along the frame top and end walls including locating posts 38. Groove 52 has a relatively deep central segment 52 The dimensions of the spring member 42 are such that the opposite ends of the spring member bridging segment 42 When the spring bridging segment 42 Still referring to FIGS. 2 and 4, the spring member segment 42 The combined thickness of body 56 and cam 62 is more or less the same as the width of the slot 52 in frame 34. Also, the segment 48 As best seen in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, actuator 46 is rotatively mounted in the connector frame 34. For this, a round opening 68 is formed in the frame rear wall 34 The notch 70 is also shaped to define a finger 74 which extends lengthwise along the frame wall 34 Referring to FIG. 4, the connector 16 is assembled by first clipping or engaging the spring member 42 in the frame groove 52 so that the spring member arms 42 Next, the end of the flexible circuit 12 is affixed to the reference surface 36 using a suitable cement. The flexible circuit notches 40 snugly receive the locating posts 38 so that both the lateral positions of the circuit relative to the connector is established from one assembly to another. Also as noted above, that post notch engagement provides strain relief so that there is minimal likelihood of the circuit 12 becoming detached from connector 16 even if it should be subjected to relatively high tensile stress. The connector 16 and its conductor 12 are assembled to board 14 by moving the actuator 46 to its releasing position using lever 48 as illustrated in FIG. 2. The engagement of the finger boss 76 in actuator dimple 65 Next the lever 48 is swung to its intermediate position shown in dotted lines in FIG. 3. In that position of the actuator, the spring bridging segment 42 It is important to note also that the upward deflection of the spring member 42 by cam 62 results in energy being stored in the spring member to compensate for variations in the thicknesses of the circuits 12 and 14 and for warps or distortions in those circuits. In other words, the two circuits are clamped together quite firmly yet resiliently by the connector 16. As noted previously, the resilient strip 37 if present, also helps in this respect. The assembling of connector 16 to board 14 as aforesaid can be accomplished with substantially zero force being applied to the board. Consequently, no stresses are applied to the board 14 that could damage the various electrical conductors and components thereon. Moreover, such assembly can be accomplished even if the two circuits are out of the direct line of sight of the assembler. He simply locates the board apertures 32, with his fingers and positions the connector 16 so that the locating posts 38 are received in those apertures. This automatically centers the circuit contacts 24 It should be appreciated also that the connector 16 can be adapted to any board thickness simply by changing the spring member 42 so that it has the proper stiffness and arm length for the particular assembly. In other words, the spring can be designed for the particular application, thereby assuring that the correct clamping pressure is obtained to assure good electrical connections between the circuits being coupled. Furthermore, no change need be made in the construction of the connector 16 when coupling to different circuit board conductor patterns. Only the layout of the contacts 24 In the assembly illustrated in FIG. 1, the required upward extension of, lever 48 in its releasing position limits the minimum distance between the PC boards in the stack. To permit closer packing, the lever 48 can be eliminated and the actuator body 56 rotated between its operative positions by other suitable means. For example, a screwdriver blade slot may be formed in the end of the actuator stub shaft 58 Also, other means may be provided to deflect the spring member 42 in order to operate the connector. FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a modified connector indicated generally at 86 employing a sliding type of actuator. This embodiment employs a frame 88 which defines at its underside a reference surface 92 to which is mounted the end of the flexible circuit 12 as described above. A pair of locating posts 94 project down from that surface at the opposite ends of frame 88. The frame also has a slot or groove 96 which extends all around the top and end walls of the frame defining fulcrums 98. Frame 88 differs from frame 34 in that it is formed with a transverse vertical slot 102 between fulcrums 98 which slot extends from the top of the frame all the way to the bottom of slot 96. Also, a pair of mirror image lengthwise grooves 104 are formed in the front and rear walls of frame 88, extending the entire length thereof and the wall portions above those grooves are set back from the remainders of the walls. Connector 86 employs a spring member substantially the same as the one described above. Accordingly it carries the same identifying numeral 42. The actuator shown generally at 110 for deflecting the spring member 42 comprises a generally rectangular cam follower 112 formed with a longitudinal passage 114 for receiving the spring member bridging segment 42 The other component of the actuator 110 is a finger actuated slider 118 which functions as a cam to effect vertical movement of the cam follower 112. The slider 118 is formed with a longitudinal groove 122 in its underside and a pair of flanges 124 project in from the side edges of that groove. The slider 118 is arranged to engage over frame 88 with the slide flanges 124 received in the frame slots 104 so that the slider can slide back and forth along the frame. A generally rectangular vertical passage 126 extends all the way down through slider 118. Also a pair of mirror image inclined slots 128 are formed in the side walls of slider 118 which slots communicate with vertical passage 126. The slots extend from the upper right hand end of passage 126 down to the locations adjacent the lower left hand end of slider 118 beyond the left hand end of passage 126. A pair of circular notches 132 are provided at the upper ends of the inclined slots 128. Also a second pair of notches or cutouts 134 are formed in the undersides of flanges 124 at the side walls of the slider beyond the lower end of slots 128. These notches establish the locking and releasing positions respectively of the actuator 110. To assemble the connector 86, the spring member 42 is clipped around the frame 88 in groove 96 with the cam follower 112 being received in the frame slot 102. The slider 118 is then slid onto the frame from the right hand end thereof. me cam follower 112 is forced down into its slot 102 manually to permit the slider to slide beyond the slot 102 opening. This permits the cam follower to position itself within the slider passage 126 with the follower stub shafts 116 engaging in the inclined slots 128 at locations above the frame grooves 104. When the slider 118 is located midway along the frame, the cam follower 112 is positioned midway along slots 128 so that the spring member bridging segment 42 As soon as the connector is seated on the board 14, the assembler can now slide slider 118 toward the left. First the spring member 42 resumes its relaxed condition whereby its arms 42 That upward deflection of the bridging segment 42 Some applications may demand that a relatively long connector be used to couple circuits 12 and 14. However, the sprung type gripping action of the connector 16 or 86 may become less effective as the length of the spring bridging segment 42 To overcome this potential problem, the parts of the actuator engaging the spring bridging segment 42 In some instances, it is desirable that the corresponding circuit contacts 24 FIG. 7 illustrates one mode of achieving such wiping contact with the present connection assembly. As shown there, the locating posts 38 of the connector 16 may be formed at their free ends with a lateral boss or bump 41. These bumps extend to one side of the connector, i.e. to the left as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 7, and their upper surfaces 41 Thus, when the connector posts 38 are inserted into the PC board openings 32 and the connector is clamped in place as described above, the inclined boss surfaces 41 Other techniques may be employed to provide such wiping contact. For example, a stiff, flat spring may be positioned between the frame reference surface 36 and the flexible circuit 12. The spring is H shaped with each leg of the spring being more or less coextensive with the reference surface. The spring is bent or flexed back on itself, i.e. at the cross arm of the H, so that the two legs are in slightly spaced apart superposition. The upper leg of the spring is positioned flush against the reference surface and is notched at its ends to interfit with posts 38. The lower leg which overlies the flexible circuit is desirably slit laterally to form individual fingers for each circuit contact 24 It will be seen from the foregoing, then, that the connector assemblies described herein provide significant advantages as compared with their prior counterparts. The assemblies require no soldering whatsoever. Rather, electrical connections are made directly between the coupled together conductors with the connectors themselves functioning as mechanical clamps. Resultantly, the connectors are quite simple in construction so that they can be manufactured quite easily at minimum cost. Furthermore, the connectors are quite compact, small and lightweight so that they occupy only a small space on the PC board and permit such boards to be stacked closely together. The connectors described herein can be scaled up or down as needed to accommodate them to flexible circuits of different size and can obviously accommodate circuits having a variety of different conductor termination patterns. They also have considerable tolerance for dimensional changes in the circuits which they are connecting together. Furthermore, they do not need to rely on resilient materials to derive the clamping force to effect the coupling. Therefore, the connectors have good long term stability. The present assembly is advantaged also in that no special modifications need be made to the PC board or other circuit coupled to. The only requirement is that locating means such as apertures 32 be provided on that board to help position the connector relative to the board s termination pads. These apertures in addition to locating the connector provide access for the spring member end hooks which clamp the connector to the board. In this connection, it should be mentioned that other locating means may be utilized in lieu of the connector posts and board apertures. For example, instead of forming locating posts on the connector frame, recesses may be provided at those locations on the frame which are arranged to receive small bosses projecting up from the printed circuit board. Small dimples or recesses can be provided in the sides of those bosses for engaging the end hooks 42 Also, it should be appreciated that, because of its unique design, the connectors described herein can be used as a simple clamp to mechanically connect one component such as a flexible circuit or harness to another or to provide strain relief for that component. The same basic structure can also be modified so that the connector functions as a switch between the contacts of one circuit and those of another. To accomplish this, a thin resilient layer of electrically insulating material can be interposed between circuit 12 and PC board 14. Such strip being formed with small openings directly opposite the circuit contacts 24 It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained, and, since certain changes may be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
