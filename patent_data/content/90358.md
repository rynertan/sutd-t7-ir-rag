## Abstract
A methanol fuel cell includes an electrolyte ion exchange membrane 1 integrated with an oxidizer electrode 3 con taining water repellent particles on one side of the membrane 1 and a hydrophilic fuel electrode 2 containing no water repellent particles on the other side thereof, with less contact resistance between the ion exchange membrane 1 and the electrodes 2, 3 and a three phase boundary readily formable in the oxidizer electrode 3 .
