Science Polymer Chemistry Edition, 17 3 85 92 1979 show an anaerobic initiation of the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate with benzaldehyde.oxygen scavenger activity is not needed in anaerobic reactions, and so Imoto et al is not pertinent to oxygen scavenging. In recent years, certain vinyl monomer, oligomer, and polymer systems have been developed which have sufficiently high molecular weight and sufficiently low odor, volatility, and toxicity so as to be useful as non volatile reactive components of high or even 100 solids resin formulations which can be cured rapidly by free radical polymerization in the absence of oxygen, i.e. anaerobically, for example in radiation cure applications or in engineering adhesives where polymerization qccurs between two substrates to be bonded. However, when cure of these vinyl unsaturated systems is attempted in the presence of air, i.e.aerobically, serious inhibition of free radical polymerization by oxygen at the air interface occurs. It is this problem to which the present invention is addressed. The present invention is concerned with the provision of oxygen scavengers for use in compositions comprising at least one vinyl unsaturated monomer, oligomer or polymer and the provision of compositions comprising at least one vinyl unsaturated monomer or an oligomer or polymer thereof which have attractive curing characteristics in the presence of oxygen. We have now found that compositions comprising an aldehyde or imine of the formula R3Qn wherein n is 1 4 R3 is an organic radical having a valence of 1 4 or hydrogen Q is of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein A is O or NR4 R1, R2, and R4 are independently selected C16 alkyl or aryl radicals or mixtures thereof, are useful oxygen scavengers in compositions containing at least one vinyl monomer, oligomer or polymer and the invention, in one aspect, is directed to this use. For the avoidance of doubt, in this specification and claims vinyl is to be regarded as embracing all monoethylenic unsaturations, for example also vinylene and vinylidene. In another aspect, the invention comprises aldehyde and or imine as defined above and a transition metal ion selected from Co , Cu , and Mn . In another aspect the invention comprises the aldehyde or imine and a vinyl unsaturated monomer and or polymer. The invention is applicable to the various compositions which comprise at least one vinyl unsaturated monomer, oligomer, or polymer and which are designed for cure in the presence of oxygen and which are available in the field of paints and other coating compositions, gel coats, tank linings, polymer concrete, high solids baking finishes and the like. A particular field in which oxygen inhibition occurs is in thin films which contain vinyl monomers where it is usually an object to obtain tack free finishes rapidly. In some cases, the desired finish is hard, whereas in other cases, such as with roof mastics, the desired finish is flexible.Particularly important systems in which the oxygen scavengers described below are useful include unsaturated polyester, acrylic melamine, reactive coalescent, vinyl ester, UV cure, concrete sealant, polymer concrete, engineering adhesive, and the like. As mentioned before, the oxygen scavengers of the invention are selected from the group consisting of compounds of the formula R3Qn wherein n is 1 4 R3 is an organic radical having a valence of 1 4 or hydrogen Q is of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein A is O or NR4 R1, R2, and R4 are independently selected C1 6 alkyl or aryl radicals or mixtures thereof. R3 is preferably of the formula R5 Y CH 2 wherein R5 is hydrogen or an organic radical of 1 4 valence and selected from C1 36 alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkylaryl, and acyl Y is O or NR6 and R6 is hydrogen or a C1 6 alkyl or aryl group. Some of the suitable aldehydes areEMI4.2 EMI4.3 EMI5.1 wherein R1 and R2 are selected from methyl, ethyl, butyl, and mixtures thereof, and m is 4 or 7 EMI5.2 wherein R9 is methyl, ethyl, or butyl EMI5.3 EMI6.1 wherein R is methyl, a 1 1 mixture of ethyl and butyl, or a 0.82 0.09 0.09 mixture of methyl, ethyl, and butyl EMI6.2 wherein R is methyl or ethyl EMI6.3 EMI7.1 Some of the suitable imines areEMI7.2 wherein m is 4 and R is methyl, ethyl, and butyl. R3 can also be selected from EMI8.1 and or a radical of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein R8 is a C16 alkyl or aryl, and Z is NR8R8. In the imines, A can be of the formulaEMI8.3 wherein R7 is C16 alkyl or aryl. A problem with some of the aldehydes used in the invention, even the preferred ones, is poor pot stability of the aldehyde vinyl unsaturated system mixtures, apparently due to premature oxidation of the aldehyde. This problem can be solved by using the corresponding imine of the invention which is in a sense a chemically blocked form of the aldehyde. However, ambient moisture is needed to hydrolyse the imine to the active aldehyde. An alternative to the imine approach is to use oxime or thiuram stabilizers to preserve the pot life of aldehyde vinyl unsaturated system mixtures. One suitable thiuram is tetramethyl thiuram disulfide TMTDS , which is most preferred. One suitable oxime is methyl ethyl ketone oxime. The oxygen scavengers of the invention are most useful in vinyl unsaturated systems which would not readily polymerize under aerobic conditions, and in such widely diverse applications as aqueous or solvent based coatings, impregnants, plastics, reinforced plastics, tank linings, gel coatings, and polymer concrete. The vinyl unsaturated systems are, for example, monomers, oligomers, and or polymers which undergo free radical polymerization and are polymerized from such monomers as i. Mono, di and trifunctional acrylates and methacrylates ii. fumarates iii. maleates iv. vinyl esters v. styrenes vi. acrylamides vii. acrylonitrile viii. itaconate esters ix. alpha methylene glutarate esters x. acryloxyproprionic acid and esters xi. methacrylic acid or acrylic acid.Such polymers as i. maleate containing polyesters ii. fumarate containing polyesters iii. itaconate containing polyesters iv. alpha methylene glutarate containing polyesters v. vinyl resins vi. urethane multi meth acrylates vii. polyester multi meth acrylates can comprise the vinyl unsaturated system. The vinyl unsaturated system can also include additive s such as pigments, colorants, sand, glass fibers, surfactants, dispersants, and defoamers. The convenient ratio of aldehyde or imine to vinyl unsaturated system is about 1 to 20 parts by weight aldehyde or imine and about 99 to 80 parts by weight vinyl unsaturated system. Mixtures of aldehydes and imines can be used. It will be noted that in the aldehyde or imine formula R1 cannot be connected to R2 so that benzaldehyde is excluded from the scope of the formula. A preferred mixture of aldehydes is the reaction product of a ethylene urea, b formaldehyde, c isobutylaldehyde, and d 2 ethyl hexanal in a molar ratio of a b of 1 2 and of a to the sum of c and d of 1 2. A particularly preferred group of imines is the reaction product of the just mentioned aldehyde mixture with t butyl amine.
