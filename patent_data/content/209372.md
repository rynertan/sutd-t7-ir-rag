## Description
This invention relates to an index guided semiconductor laser device which attains laser oscillation at an extremely low threshold current level without creating astigmatism. Conventional semiconductor laser devices are classified into two groups, gain guided semiconductor laser devices and index guided semiconductor laser devices, according to their optical waveguiding mechanism. Index guided semiconductor laser devices are superior to gain guided semiconductor laser devices in view of transverse mode stabilization which is important in practical use. Index guided semiconductor laser devices having a variety of structures have been proposed, typical examples of which are BH buried heterostructure lasers and VSIS V channeled substrate inner stripe lasers. Figure 2 A of the accompanying drawings shows a conventional BH laser device, in which a multi layered crystal structure having the width W is formed into a stripe on a p GaAs substrate 1 so as to function as a laser oscillation operating area. The multi layered crystal structure constitutes a double heterostructure which is composed of a p GaAlAs cladding layer 2, a GaAlAs active layer 3, an n GaAlAs cladding layer 4, and an n GaAs cap layer 5. A substance 15 having a low refractive index is buried outside of the active layer 3, resulting in an index guided structure creating no astigmatism and having a threshold current of as small as about 10mA. However, if a proper refractive index is not applied to the burying layer 15 and if a proper width is not applied to the waveguide, the device will oscillate in a high order transverse mode. Thus, the BH laser device is disadvantageous in that it is restricted by production conditions. Figure 2 B shows a conventional VSIS laser device, which is produced as follows On a p GaAs substrate The reason why the threshold current of the VSIS laser device becomes high is as follows Current injected into the device is confined within the inner striped structure formed by the current blocking layer It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor laser device which, overcomes the above described disadvantages and deficiencies of the known devices. A semiconductor laser device in accordance with the present invention, comprises a multi layered crystal structure containing an active layer for laser oscillation on a V stripe channeled substrate, wherein regions by means of which carriers within said active layer are prevented from diffusing outside of said active layer are disposed facing each other with an optical waveguide therebetween which is formed by the absorption of light by the shoulder portions of the V striped channel, the distance between said regions being narrower than the width of the V striped channel in the vicinity of both facets and wider than the width of the V striped channel inside of both facets, that means in the remaining part. The regions for preventing carriers from diffusing outside of said active layer are, in a preferred embodiment, composed of burying layers having a greater energy gap than said active layer. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible 1 a semiconductor laser device which oscillates at a low threshold current level 2 a semiconductor laser device which does not create astigmatism and 3 a semiconductor laser device which does not create a high order transverse mode. The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which A VSIS semiconductor laser device in accordance with the present invention contains regions by means of which carriers within the active layer are prevented from diffusing outside of the waveguide. The distance between said regions is narrower than the width of the V channel in the vicinity of both facets of the device and wider than the width of the V channel inside of both facets, that means in the remaining part.
