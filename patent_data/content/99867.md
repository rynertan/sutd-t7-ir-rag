# Electrolytic cell cathode.

## Abstract
A material for acting as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution in an electrolytic cell is formed from a host matrix including at least one transition element which is structurally modified by incorporating one or more modifier elements at least one of which is a transition element to improve its catalytic properties, Modifer elements, including for example Ti, Mo, Sr, Si, La, Ca, O and Co, structurally modify the local chemical environments of the host matrix formed of a transition element such as Ni, Mo, or Co to provide a material having an increased density of catalytically active sites which exhibits low overvoltages when utilized as a catalytic material for a electrolyte cell cathode. The material may also include a leachable modifier element, such as Al or Zn, which is partially removed to further modify the material and enhance its catalytic activity. The catalytic material can be formed by vacuum deposition techniques such as by cosput tering the host matrix and modifier element to form a layer of catalytic material on an electrode substrate.
