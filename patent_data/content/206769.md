# A process for the production of alpha human atrial natriuretic polypeptide.

## Abstract
A process for the production of α human atrial natriuretic polypeptide α hANP involves firstly culturing a micro organism which has been transformed with an expression vector comprising a synthetic gene encoding the amino acid se quence of a protective peptide fused α hANP in a culture medium. Subsequently recovering the protective peptide fused α hANP from the culture broth and then removing the protective peptide part from the peptide fused polypeptide. In addition to the process itself, chemically synthesised genes for α hANP and protective peptide fused α hANP are also described together with the corresponding recombinant vectors and transformants comprising the same. α hANP is known to be useful as an antihypertensive diuretic agent.
