## Description
IMIDE CROSSLINKED ETHYLENIC POLYMER RESIN FOAMS AND METHOD OF MAKING This invention concerns cellular highly crosslinked threre dimensional ethylenic polymer resins which include but are not limited to such resins having polymeric structures illustrated by the formula EMI1.1 Formula I wherein R is an organic radical with its bod on dif ferent carbon atoms. Such resins have carbon to carbon ethylenic polymer chains and multiple imide crosslinkages. Resins having structure like that of FormulaI are known in non cellular form, but foams of such resins have not heretofore been known. For example, such non cellular, crosslinked resins from N,N bis maleimides are described in U. S. Patents Nos. 3,380,964 F. Grundschober et al. , 3,406,148 J. Sambeth et al. , 3,533,996 F.Grundschober et al. , and 3,390,272 G. F. D Alelio . The polyimide foams that are known in the art have resin structures different from that of Formula I and include those wherein the imide groups are recurring linkages in the main polymer chain such as those obtained by reaction of a dianhydride of a tetracarboxylic acid, e.g., pyromellitic dianhydride and a diamine as described in U. S. Patents Nos. 3,249,561 W. R. Hendrix , 3,310,506 L. E. Amborski et al. , 3,433,144 E. Lavin et al. , and 3,554,939 E. Lavin et al. . Foams having structures similar to those just mentioned are also made by reaction of a tetracarboxylic acid or dianhydride with a polyisocyanate as described in 3,300,420 H. E. Frey , 3,479,305 S. T. Kus et al. , 3,489,696 G. W. Miller , 3,562,189 W. J. Farrissey, Jr., et al. , 3,620,987 A. M. McLauglin et al. , 3,644,234 R. L. Grieve , and 3,772,216 R. W.Rosser et al. . Another kind qf foam from resins having imide linkages is described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 25 17 106 F. Zumstein et at. . None of these prior art foam resins has resin polymeric molecular structure like that of Formula I. Although, as mentioned, non cellular forms of such resins are known, their highly crosslinked molecular structure would prevent the simple expansion thereof to foamed products in the manner of foaming usual thermoplastic resins. More particularly this invention provides a cellular resin body having apparent density less than 30 pounds per cubic foot 480 g l characterized in that the resin is a highly crosslinked three dimensional polymer consisting essentially of mer units having the general structural formula EMI2.1 Formula II wherein A is a tetravalent organic radical, the carbonyl groups are attached to vicinal carbon atoms in A, the polymeric valence bonds of A are on vicinal carbon atoms, R is a hydrocarbyl or oxydi hydrocarbyl radical having at least 2 carbon atoms and having x valence bonds on different carbon atoms, x is a small number at least 2, preferably 2 to 4, and the above illustrated unit is connected by the polymer valence bonds thereof to at least two other such units.Radical R includes aliphatic, acylic or cyclic, aromatic, combinations of aliphatic and aromatic, heterocyclic and bridged radicals. When R contains an aromatic ring, the same is any such as EMI3.1 andEMI3.2 where the rings may be further substituted with alkyl, alkoxy, halo or like non functional groups, and R2 is any bridging group such as methylene or other alkylene, e.g., having up to four carbon atoms, oxygen, carbonyl, sulfur alone or as sulfoxide or sulfone, or phosphorus in phosphine oxide, phosphite or phosphate, or silicon in silane or siloxane, or tertiary amine nitrogen or the like. R is preferably a hydrocarbyl radical or oxydi hydrocarbyl radical, especially methylenedi phenylene or oxydiphenylene. When x in Formula II is 2, the mer units are bis imides, and the resin structure can be represented by the formula EMI4.1 Formula II A The poly bis maleimide of Formula I is illustrative of the resins of Formulae II and II A. Each mer unit of the resin structures shown in Formulae I, II and II A is connected by its polymer valence bonds to at least two other such units. Such cellular resin bodies are made in accordance with the method of this invention by heating to temperature typically above 2000C to effect polymerization, crosslinking and foaming of a reaction mixture containing the resin forming reactant or reactants. In one variation of the method, the resin forming reaction mixture comprises at least one ethylenically unsaturated cyclic imide having the general formula EMI4.2 Formula III wherein R and x are the same as in Formula II and wherein the divalent radical A has a polymerizable ethylenic double bond and is the C C monomeric form of the tetravalent radical A in Pormula II. In such monomeric form, the divalent radical A of Formula III is preferably at least one of the groups represented by the formulae EMI5.1 wherein the valences are attached to carbonyl groups, i.e., corresponding to maleic, tetrahydrophthalic and bicbclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic groups, respectively, which on addition polymerization of the ethylenic double bond forms the tetravalent radical A in Formula II. In the above form of the method, the reaction mixture also contains a thermally decomposable chemical blowing agent which, upon heating of the reaction mixture, generates gases as the A groups of the imide polymerize and crosslink forming a cellular resin structure. In another variation of the method, the resin forming reaction mixture comprises at least one ethylenically unsaturated amic acid having the general formula EMI5.2 Formula IV wherein R, A and x are the same as in Formula III. In this form of the method, as the A groups polymerize and crosslink on heating the reaction mixture, the amic acid groups tend to cyclize forming cyclic imide groups and liberating water. The water so formed acts as a blowing agent, forming a cellular resin structure. However, the starting reaction mixture advantageously contains an added thermally decomposable blowing agent. In yet another variation of the method, the resin forming reaction mixture comprises at least one polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid cyclic anhydride and at last one primary polyamine having the formulae, respectively EMI6.1 Formula V Formula VI wherein A, R and x are again the same as in Formula II.The anhydride and primary amine groups interact to form amic acid groups which, as in the case previously described, tend to cyclize forming cyclic imide groups when the reaction mixture is heated to polymerize the A groups. As in the modes starting with amic acids, water is formed and contributes to cell formation in this resin forming reaction mixture, which advantageously also contains a thermally decomposable blowing agent. The resin forming and foaming reactions are advantageously carried out in the presence of certain surface active agents, i.e., surfactants, which assist in initiating and stabilizing uniform cell structure in the foaming and foamed product. The products of this invention are rigid, strong cellular resin bodies having density less than thirty pounds per cubic foot pcf 480 g l . They have high thermal stability, low heat conductivity, low thermal expansion, insolubility in common solvents and outstanding resistance to ignition and burning. When exposed to a flame of combustible gas in air at temperature in the order of 1100 C, they do not melt or ignite they can be heated to glowing in such flame and generate little smoke with only slow loss of weight. Thus, they are useful for insulation and fabrication of articles requiring such resistance and inertness. In the modes of reaction using starting cyclic anhydrides of Formula , illustrative and preferred such anhydrides are maleic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid anhydrie, and mixtures thereof as specific examples. In the modes of reaction using starting poly primary amines of general Formula VI, specific such amines for illustration, not excluding others include ethylenediamine propy lenedi amine butylenediamine tetramethylenediamine hexamethylenediamine octame thy lenedi amine 3 methyl heptamethylenediamine 2,5 dimethyl hexamethylenediamine decamethylenediamine 2,11 diaminododecane 1,4 diaminocyclohexane 1,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane 1,2 bis 3 aminopropoxy ethane N,N bis 3 aminopropyl methylamine 1,4 phenylenediamine 1, 3 phenylenediamine the several tolylenediamines the several a,a and ar, ar xylylenediamines 1,3, 5 triaminobenzene 2,4,6 triaminotoluene 4,4 methylenedianiline 3,3 methylenedianiline 4,4 methylene bis 2 chloroaniline 2 ,2 bis 3 aminophenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 aminophenyl propane 4,4 oxydianiline 4,4 and 3,3 diaminobenzophenone bis 3 aminophenyl sulfide bis 4 aminophenyl sulfidc bis 3 aminophenyl disulfide bis 4 aminophenyl disulfide bis 3 aminophenyl sulfoxide bis 4 aminophenyl sulfoxide bis 3 aminophenyl sulfone bis 4 aminophenyl sulfone bis 3 aminophenyl dimethylamine bis 4 aminophenyl dimethylamine bis 3 aminophenyl phosphine oxide bis 4 aminophenyl phosphine oxideN,N bis 3 aminophenyl methylamineN,N bis 4 aminophenyl methylamine 4,4 diaminobiphenyl 4,4 diamino 3,3 dichlorobiphenyl 4,4 diamino 3,3 dimethylbiphenyl 4,4 diamino 3,3 dimethoxybiphenyl 1,5 diaminonaphthalene and 1,4 , 2,6 , 2,7 etc. 2,4 bis beta amino t butyl toluene bis para beta amino t butyl phenyl ether para bis 2 methyl 4 amino phenyl benzene para bis 1,1 dimethyl 5 amino phenyl benzene 1,4 bis 4 aminophenoxy benzene bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane 2,6 diaminopyridine and mixtures thereof. Also suitable are poly methylene aryl amines such as those of the general formula EMI9.1 wherein y is an integer from 0 to 4 preferably having an average value from 0 x in Formula VI is 2 to 1 x is 3 . The preferred polyamines are those which have high boiling points. In modes of reaction using ethylenically unsaturated cyclic imides of the general Formula III, such imides can be viewed as imide derivatives of the poly primar amines just described. Specific examples for illustration and not to exclude other examples of imides of Formula III useful in this method include N,N ethylene bis maleimide N,N hexamethylene bis maleimide N,N m or p phenylene bis maleimi e N ,N p, p diphenylme thane bis maleimide N,N p,p diphenylether bis maleimide N,N p,p diphenylsulfide bis maleimide N,N p,p diphenylsulfone bis maleimide N ,N 4,4 dicyclohexylme thane bis maleimide N,N a ,a dimethylenecyclohexane bis rnaleirnide N,N 4,4 benzophenone bis maleimide N,N 1,5 naphthalene bis maleimide and like maleimides of poly primary amines and mixtures thereof, and corresponding imides of tetrahydrophthalic acid, of bicyclo 2.2.l hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid, and mixtures of such acids. In modes of reaction using ethylenically unsaturated amic acids of general Formula IV, these can be viewed as amic acid derivatives of the poly primary amines of Formula VI hereinbefore specifically illustrated.Specific examples for illustration and not to exclude other examples of amic acids of Formula IV useful in this method include N ,N ethylene bis maleamic acid N,N hexamethylene bis maleamic acid N,N m or p phenylen bis maleamic acid N,N p,p diphenylmethane bis maleamic acid N,N p,p diphenylether bis maleamic acid N,N p,p diphenylsulfide bis maleamic acid N,N p,p diphenylsulfone bis maleamic acid N,N 4,4 dicyclohexlmethane bis maleamic acid N ,N a,a dimethylenecyclohexane bis maleamic acid N,N 4,4 benzophenone bis maleamic acid N,N 1,5 naphthalene bis maleamic acid and like maleamic acids of poly primary amines and mixtures thereof, and corresponding amic acids of tetrahydrophthalic acid, of bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid, and of mixtures of such acids. While the reaction conditions to make the imide crosslinked foams of this invention vary somewhat depending upon the starting material and reaction route as will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the resin forming foaming reaction generally involves heating the reaction mixture to a temperature above the melting point of the mixture, typically above 2000C, at which temperature polymerization of the ethylenic C C linkages takes place, in the presence of a thermally decomposable blowing agent and, optionally, in the presence of a surfactant, with the formation of a crosslinked ethylenic polymer resin foam. The blowing agent is selected to be relatively stable at temperatures below the temperature at which the reaction mixture melts and undergoes crosslinking and to decompose at such crosslinking polymerization temperature to evolve gaseous and or vaporous products within the resin forming reaction mixture causing foaming thereof while the reaction mixture is in the transition stage from a mobile flowable state to a non flowable state. The blowing agents are normally solid materials usually used in finely divided form and uniformly dispersed in the starting reaction mixture. Such blowing aaents are known per se as described in Plastic Foams byCalvin J. Benning, Vol. 2, pages 294 313, and are commercially available under various brand names.Specific examples of such blowing agents useful and preferred in the present invention include ethylene carbonate, p toluene sulfonyl semicarbazide e.g., Celogen RA trade name ofUniroyal , and 5 phenyltetrazole U.S. Patent 3,442,829, L. D. Moore et al. cf. 3,873,477, W. Beck et al. . The amount of blowing agent used is predetermined by the specific characteristics of the blowing agent and the resin reaction mixture to provide the desired apparent density in the resulting foamed resin product, usually in proportion up to 20 parts, preferably from 1 to 10 parts, of blowing agent per 100 parts of primary resin forming reactants in the resin reaction mixture, by weight. When a surfactant is used in the resin formingfoaming reaction mixture, its function is to assist in initiation of gas bubbles in the foaming reaction mixture, to stabilize the cell structure of the foam, and to assist in obtaining uniform, small cells, i.e., fine celled foam. Typical surfactants for general use in resin foam technology are known per se as described in PlasticFoams by Calvin J. Benning, Vol. 2, pages 320 325.However, when the resin forming foaming reaction takes place at high reaction temperature, the selected surfactant should be one which is thermally stable at such temperature.For reactions at 2250C in accord with this invention, the following surfactants were found to be sufficiently stable and effective for the purpose Surfactant Trade Name Chemical Description 1.

Silicone glycol block copolymers, which are effective surfactants in many urethane foam systems, were ineffective in the present resin forming foaming process as were other surfactants which are thermally unstable at the high temperatures employed. When used, surfactants are usually used in amounts up to 25 parts, preferably from 1 to 10 parts thereof per 100 parts of the resin forming reaction mixture, by weight. In the preparation of imide crosslinked polymer foams frown unsaturated imides of Formula 1I according to this invention, the imide, for exaraple, 4,4 methylene dianiline bis maleimide, preferably in powdered solid form, is mixed with blowing agent and, optionally, surfactant and heated to a temperature above its melting point and typically above 200our until the exothermic addition polymerization reaction of the ethylenic C C linkages occurs, and above the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent. The reaction mixture, which is fluid when the imide first melts, becomes more viscous as the polymerization proceeds and foams as the gaseous or vaporous decomposition products are formed from the blowing agent.The viscosity and volume of the foaming reaction mixture increase until the resin material hardens and no further expansion occurs. Heating is preferably continued at temperature up to 3000C to fully cure the resin and complete the crosslinking polymerization reaction. Typically, the reaction mixture is heated for about 30 minutes at 2000 to 2500C and for an additional period of up to 90 minutes at 2500 to 3000C. The resulting foamed resin product is usually beige to tan to black or nearly black in color, infusible, insoluble in usual solvents, and cannot be ignited with an ordinary gas flame in air.The apparent density of the resulting foamed resin product depends on the kind and amount of blowing agent, surfactant and imide and is usually from 0.5 pcf 0.008 g cc to 30 pcf 0.48 g cc. In the preparation of crosslinked resin foams from unsaturated amic acids of Formula IV according to his invention, the amic acid, for example, 4,4t met ,lylene c aniline bis maleamic acid, preferably in powdered solid form, is usually mixed with blowing agent and, optionally, surfactant and heated to reaction temperature.At and above the melting point, typically above 2000C, e.g., from 2000 to 275 C, the amic acid groups usually cyclize to form cyclic imide linkages, e.g., maleimide groups, w th loss of water. roncurrently at such temperatures, addition poly merization of the ethylenic C C groups occurs, and the thermally decomposable blowing agent decomposes. The gaseous and vaporous products from the blowing agent, if present, and the water vapor from the imide cyclization of the amic acid groups cause foaming of the reaction mixture as polymerization continues to form a highly crosslinked structure.The viscosity and volume of the foaming reaction mixture increase until the resin material hardens and no further expansion occurs. Heating is preferably continued at temperature up to 300 C to fully cure the resin and complete the crosslinking polymerization reaction. Typically, the reaction mixture is heated for 30 minutes at 2000 to 2500C and for an additional period up tc 90 minutes at 2500 to 3000C. The resulting foamed resin products from these amic acids are very similar tc the foamed resin products from imides. In the preparation of crosslinked resin foams by another mode of the method of this invention, the primary starting materials are ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid cyclic andrides and primary polyamines, both as hereinbefore defined. In this mode, the anhydride and primary amino groups are believed to react to form intermediate amic acids which by loss of water form cyclic imide groups.The reactants are uniformly mixed in proportions preferably near to one mole of the anhydride for each ar no equivalent of the polyamine, e.g., two moles cf maleic anhydride for one mole of a methylenedianiline, i.e., in nearly theoretical proportion of x moles anhydride per mole of poly primary amine R NH2 x In one variation, the mixture of anhydride and polyamine, together with blowing agent and surfactant, is heated to temperature typically above 200 C where the mixture is molten and where chemical reactions occur to form cyclic imide groups and where the blowing agent, if present, decomposes while cross linking poly merIz tion of the C C linkages take place.In another variation, the starting anhydride and starting polyamine, either ore or boch also containing one or both of the selected blowing agent and surfactant, are separately preheate, e.g., to l500 2000C, and streams of the hot starting materials in required proportion are fed together and rapidly and thoroughly mixed together. In either case, the reaction miY.tue is allowed or caused to increase in temperature to effect the resin forming and foaming reactions.Further processing of the resulting reaction mixture and product is similar to that described for other modes of the invention, i.e., heating at temperature up to 30COC until the resin structure is fully cured. The reaction mixtures can also include modifying amounts of other reactant materials. For example, modifying amounts of non polymerizable acid anhydrides such as succinic anhydride or phthalic anhydride, or of mono primary amines or of secondary amines can be included in the reaction mixture to modify the molecular structure and properties of the resin foam product, if desired. The starting reaction mixtures can also contain fillers and fibrous materials, especially inert inorganic fillers, glass beads, micro balloons or fibers, carbon fibers, or the like. Starting reaction mixtures of starting ur.saturated imide or amic acid with blowing agent and with surfactant, fillers and like additives, are storage stable and can be held indefinitely at ordinary room temperature before heating to effect foaming and resin polymerization.Similarly, the initial reaction mixture product of anhydride and poly primary amine, together with optional blowing agent, surfactant, filler, etc., if it is cooled before the temperature exceeds about 200 C, is storage stable and can be held indefinitely at ordinary room temperature before heating to effect foaming and resin polymerization. The crosslinked resin foams of this invention can be foie or fabricated into useful articles. Full or partial shaping can be obtained by carrying out the rasin fornling fcaning reaction in a suitable mold, e.g., a vented closed mold. Blocks, slabs and boards are also made by allowing the resin to foam upward with a free top surface or between parallel belts. Fully cured resin foam bodies can be post fabricated into useful objects by conventional means of cutting, sawing, drilling and other machining. The following examples further illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated or required by the context. Examples 1 12 The principal reactants in these examples were as follows Examples 1 3 100 parts of 4,4 methylene dianiline bis maleimide Examples 4 6 100 parts of 4,4 methylene dianiline bis maleamic acid Examples 7 9 100 parts of a blend of 2 moles of maleic anhydride and 1 mole of 4,4 methylenedianiline Examples lO 12 100 parts of 4,4 oxydianiline bis maleimide.In each, to the 100 parts of principal reactants, was added 10 parts of p toluene sulfonyl semicarbazide as decomposable blowing agent and 10 parts of a fatty acid alkanolamide surfactant tradenamed Ninol AA 62 fromStephan Chemicai Company. Each formulation was ground and thoroughly blended together and was placed in an aluminum pan in an air circulating oven at temperatures and for times set out in Table I, after which the foamed products were removed, cooled and tested.

The cells were generally closed and of quite uniform small size. A small piece of each was tested and found to be completely insoluble in dimethylformamide in which all of the principal reaction starting materials were soluble. A piece of each foam product was held for ten seconds in a horizontal position 1.5 inches 3.81 cm above the top and in the flame of a standard Bunsen burner burning natural gas in air, then removed. The flame temperature impinging on the foam surface was measured as 10270C. In each instance, the foamed resin did not melt, drip or fuse. The area of resin foam surface on which the flame inpinged glowed red in the gas flame, but there was very little smoke therefrom. Immediately after removing the foam piece from the burner flame, a check was made for any persisting surface flame or burning on the resin surface.It was observed in Examples 1 6 that any such surface flame lasted less than one second a surface flame lasted slightly longer in Example 7 but less than one second in Examples 8 and 9 in Examples 10 12, a surface flame lasted longer in 10 foam of greater density and least in Example 12. After cooling, the area of foamed resin exposed to gas flame in each instance was still strong, not punky . Example 13 In each of several teSts, 100 parts of 4,4 methylene dianiline bis maleamic acid was ground and thoroughly mixed together with 10 parts of p toluene sulfonyl semicarbazide blowing agent and 10 parts of one of the surfactants identified in Table II. In each test, the mixture was placed in an aluminum pan and heated in an air oven at 2250C for ten minutes, whereupon it was removed, cooled and evaluated, especially as to apparent density of the foam and the size and uniformity of its cells as a measure of surfactant efficacy. The results are set out in Table II.

A piece of ordinary filter paper was pinned to one face of the foam board while a flame from a portable propane gas torch burning in air was impinged on the other face of the board opposite the paper. The resin foam surface glowed cherry red in the gas flame but did not fuse or ignite. After 10 minutes, no scorching of the filter paper could be seen, and no afterglow was seen on the foam surface when the gas flame was momentarily removed.The flame exposure was resumed and continued for an additional 20 minutes total of 30 minutes after this time, the filter paper was slightly discolored but had not ignited.
