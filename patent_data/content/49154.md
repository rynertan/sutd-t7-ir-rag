# In place gas cleaning of diffusion elements.

## Abstract
The cleaning of multi pore diffusion elements 490 , while being submerged in a liquid medium, by the intermit tent or continuous passage of a cleaning gas therethrough, either alone or in admixture with the treatment gas 480 . The frequency or amount of cleaning gas is such as to prevent fouling of the elements 490 , and determined with reference to the dynamic wet pressure of the elements 490 or the mean bubble release pressure relative to their base condition. The maximum permitted pressure level is 25 inches of water gauge above the base condition, the dynamic wet pressure being determined at 2 SCFM per square foot of active gas discharge surface. The cleaning gas coming from the cleaning gas system 500 is fed to the elements 490 through a network including a plurality of distribution pipes 489 to which the elements 490 are connected normally at or adjacent the base 471 of a treatment tank 470 .
