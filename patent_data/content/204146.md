## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition. More particularly, it relates to a herbicidal composition comprising as the active ingredients a 2 4chloro 2 fluoro 5 propargyloxyphenyl 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro lH 1,2,4 triazolo 1,2 a pyridazine 1,3 2H dione hereinafter referred to as Compound I of the formula EMI1.1 and b at least one of N phosphonomethyl glycine of the formula EMI1.2 or its salt hereinafter referred to as glyphosate ,DL homoalanin 4 yl methyl phosphinic acid of the formula EMI1.3 or its salt hereinafter referred to as glufosinate , 2 amino 4 hydroxy methyl phosphionyl butyrylalanylalanine of the formula EMI2.1 or its salt hereinafter referred to as bialaphos , and l,l dimethyl 4 4 bipyridinium ion of the formula EMI2.2 or its salt hereinafter referred to as paraquat , which exerts a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds without causing any material phytotoxicity to crop plants. In recent years, there have been used a great number 4f chemicals having herbicidal activities in order to exterminate or control undesired vegetation of weeds in agricultural and non agricultural fields. Since, however, weeds are diversified in kinds and grow over a long period of time, the herbicidal effects of conventional herbicidal agents are restricted in general. Under the circumstances, the appearance of any herbicidal agent exerting a strong herbicidal activity as well as a broad herbicidal spectrum over a wide variety of weeds has been highly demanded. As a result of the extensive study, it has now been found that the associated use of a Compound I with b at least one of glyphosate II 1 , glufosinate II 2 , blaphos 11 3 and paraquat 11 4 , these being hereinafter referred to as Compounds II , produces a highly enhanced herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds in agricultural and non agricultural fields. In comparison with the sole use of each of said active ingredients, enhancement of the herbicidal potency on such associated use is remarkable so that the active ingredients may be applied in smaller dosages. Further, the weed control spectrum is greatly enlarged. Thus, a clear and definite synergistic effect is observed in said associated use. The herbicidal composition of the invention can exterminate or control a variety of weeds, of which typical examples are broad leaved weeds such as wild. buckwheat Polygonum convolvulus , pale smartweed Polygonum lapathifolium , common purslane tPortulaca oleracea , common chickweed tellaria media , common lambsquarters Chenopodium album , redroot pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus , radish Raphanus sativus , wild mustard Sinapis arvensis , shepherdspurse Capsella bursa pastoris , hemp sesbania Sesbania exaltata , sicklepod Cassia obtusifolia , velvetleaf Abutilon theophrasti , prickly sida Sida spinosa , field pansy Viola arvensis , cleavers Galium aparine , ivyleaf morningglory Ipomoea hederacea , tall morningglory Pharbitis purpurea , field bindweed Convolvulus arvensis , purple deadnettle Lamium purpureum , henbit Lamium amplexicaure , jimsonweed Datura stramonium , black nightshade Solanum nigrum , persian speedwell Veronica persica , common cocklebur Xanthium strumarium , common sunflower Helianthus annuus , scentless chamomile Matricaria perforata , corn marigold Chrysanthemum segetum , curly dock Rumex crispus , Japanese mugwort Artemisia princeps and common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia graminaceous weeds such as japanese millet Echinochloa frumentacea , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crus galli , green foxtail Setaria viridis , large crabgrass Digitaria sanguinalis , annual bluegrass Poa annua , blackgrass Alopecurus myosuroides , oats Avena sativa , wild oats Avena fatua , johnsongrass Sorghum halepense , auackgrass Agropyron repents , downy brome Bromus tectorum and bermudagrass Cynodon dactylon , commelinaceous weeds such as asiatic dayflower Commelina communis and cyperaceous weeds such as rice flats wedge Cyperus iria and purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus , etc. Compound I is known to exert a herbicidal activity U.S. patent 4,452,981 . Glyphosate II 1 is described in C.R. Worthing et al The Pesticide Manual , 7, 303 1983 published by The British Crop Protection Council and known as a herbicide As the salt, there may be exemplified isopropylamine salt, etc. Glufosinate II 2 is described in Thomson Agricultural Chemicals Book II,Herbicides, page 224, 1983 and known as a herbicide. As the salt, there may be used ammonium salts, etc. Bialaphos II 3 is described in Hodogaya Kagaku Short Review ofHerbicide, page 210, 1982 and known as a herbicide.

Thomson AgriculturalChemicals Book II, Herbicides, page ill 1983 and known as a herbicide.As the salt, there may be exemplified dichloride, dimethylsulfate, etc. However, the associated use of Compound I with any of Compounds II has never been attempted, and the production of said synergistic effect on such associated use has never been expected. The proportion of Compound I as the component a and Compound s II as the component b in the composition of the invention may vary in a considerably broad range and is usually within a range of 1 0.1 to 1 70 weight. When Compound II is glyphosate II 1 , its amount is preferably from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, especially from 1 to 32 parts by weight, to one part by weight of Compound I . When glufosinate II 2 is used asCompound II , its amount is favorably from 0.1 to 70 parts by weight, particularly from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, to one part by weight of Compound I . In case of Compound II being bialaphos II 3 , it may be used preferably in an amount of from 0.1 to 70 parts by weight, especially from 0.5 to 70 parts by weight, to one part by weight of Compound I . Further, in case of Compound II being paraquat II 4 , it may be be used preferably in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, especially from 0.2 to 40 parts by weight, to one part by weight of Compound I . In addition to the above active ingredients, the composition may contain a solid or liquid carrier or diluent. Any surface active or auxiliary agent may be also contained therein. Thus, the composition may be formulated in any conventional preparation form such as emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or suspension. The total content of the active ingredients, i.e. Compound I andCompound s II , may be from 1 to 90 by weight, preferably from 2 to 80 by weight. As the solid carrier or diluent, there may be used kaolin clay, attapulgite clay, bentonite, terra alba, pyrophyllite, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcite, wallnut shell powder, urea, ammonium sulfate, synthetic hydrated silica, etc. Examples of the liquid carrier or diluent are aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. xylene, methylnaphthalene , alcohols e,g. isopropanol, ethylene glycol, cellosolve , ketones e.g. acetone, cyclohexanone, isophorone , vegetable oils e.g. soybean oil, cotton seed oil , dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, water, etc. The surface active agent used for emulsification, dispersion or spreading may be any of the anionic and nonionic type of agents. Examples of the surface active agent include alkylsulfates, alkylarylsulfonates, dialkylsulfo succinates, phosphates of polyoxyethylenealkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, etc. Examples of the auxiliary agents include ligninsulfonates, sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, gum arabic, CMC carboxymethyl cellulose , PAP isopropyl acid phosphate , etc. Practical embodiments of the composition are illustratively shown in the following Formulation Examples wherein part s are by weight.

A composition comprising Compound I andCompound s II thus formulated is useful for post emergence control of undesired weeds by foliar treatment. The foliar treatment may be effected by spraying the composition containing Compound I and Compound s II over the top of plants. The direct application may also be adopted. The composition may be also useful for pre emergence control of undesired weeds by soil treatment. By this treatment, undesirable vegetation of weeds is controlled with exertion of no material phytotoxicty to important crop plants such as soybean, cotton, corn and wheat.
