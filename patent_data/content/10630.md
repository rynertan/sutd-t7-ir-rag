## Description
Coating of plant seeds This invention is concerned with the coating of plant seeds. To meet specific needs, various coatings have been applied to seeds. For example, seeds have been pelletized to make them more uniform in size, thereby facilitating handling and mechanical sowing, Pelleting is especially useful for small seeds and seeds of irregular shape.Alternatively, coatings have been applied to seeds as a means of protection against cold and disease. Such coatings may contain insecticides, fungicides, growth stimulants and like agents. To the coatings may also be adhered alkaline substances, especially to those applied to seeds preferring neutral soils but which are to be sown in acid soils.Application of a coating has also been used as a means for retarding germination, so that coated and uncoated seeds of varieties normally flowering and maturing over different time intervals may be planted simultaneously.Both the varieties will then flower at the same time. This technique is useful in the production of hybrid seed corn. Whilst the application of a coating is a relatively simple procedure, it must nevert e css reet certain criteria in order to be a viable operation of being carried out economically on a large scale. The applied coating should be even and have sufficient mechanical resistance to remain intact on handling in order to assure maximum protection for the seed. Methods of applying coatings should desirably be capable of treating in a short processing time large quantities of seed, up to 10 tonnes per hour, without any significant losses. The coating itself should be stable on storage and unaffected by temperature changes. It has now been found that certain binders more fully described hereafter are especially suitable for use in seed coatings containing fungicides with other optional ingredients In accordance with this invention, there is provided a process for the treatment of plant seeds which comprises forming on the surface of the seeds a firmly adhering, moisture permeable, essentially water insoluble coating having the following composition binder 10 to 64 by weight fungicide 18 to 67 by weight insecticide 0 to 69 by weight minor additives 0 to 10 by weight The process is most conveniently carried out by applying to the seeds an essentially non aqueous coating solution of the following composition binder 3.5 to 22.5 by weight binder solvent 67.0 to 87.0 by welght fungicide 7.0 to 22.5 by weight insecticide 0 to 26.0 by weight minor additives 0 to 3.0 by weight the respective weight ratios of solvent to binder and solvent to total solids in the solution being 3.5 to 20 1 and 1.8 to 4,2 1, and thereafter eliminating the solvent. It will be observed that the binder is essentially insoluble in water which, inter alia, makes the seed much less sensitive to exposure to moisture on storage and after sowing is not washed off the seed by rain, so that the active ingredients remain with the seed for a longer time. The coating however is moisture permeable so that the seed germinates normally. The binder is desirably a natural resin such as shellac, a synthetic resin such as polystyrene or a synthetic or natural wax polyethylene glycol or coffee wax usually obtained by solvent extraction of green coffee . Mixtures of binders may also be used, as for example shellac with coffee wax or polyethylene glycol. The amount of binder present in the coating solution will normally vary according to its nature.Thus, natural substances taken together, may be present in amounts of up to about 25 by weight, whereas synthetic resins will usually not exceed about 10 of the weight of the coating solution. The term solution is used for convenience, denoting that the binder is dissolved in the solvent. However, ingredients may be present, notably one or more fungicides, which do not dissolve in the solvent, so therefore technically the coating solution may in fact also be a suspension. The solvent which term for convenience also designates solvent mixtures will be selected having regard to the binder used, and will normally be a lower alkanol or ketone or a halogenated hydrocarbon. To facilitate their elimination, solvents having relatively low boiling points are preferred. Needless to say, the solvent should not be phytotoxic. Different fungicides may be incorporated in the coating, and as these substances are well known per se no detailed discussion of their properties is necessary.As noted above, the fungicide need not necessarily be soluble in the binder solvent. One or more fungicides may be incorporated, and their total weight may represent up to 22.5 of the composition. One or more insecticides may also be present, as well as other additives such as pigments, growth stimulants, minor nutrients fertilizers, bird repellents. The coating solution is most conveniently applied to the seeds by spraying whilst the seeds are in motion, conveniently in a tumbler, rotating drum or similar piece of equipment. Thereafter, the solvent is eliminated for example by application of a vacuum or passing warm air through the coated seeds. The vaporised solvent will usually be condensed for re use. The relative proportions of coating solution to seed will depend, inter alia, on its concentration of active ingredients, the desired thickness of the coating and also on the size of the seed.In general, the coating solution to seed ratio will be 1 to 100 by weight. For example, 100 kg of maize seed may be treated with about 1.5 kg of coating solution con taining about 20 fungicide. Satisfactory binder to seed ratio are 1 to 2 1000. Coatings in accordance with the invention n ay be applied to a wide variety of seeds, and may, liaise, contain a wide range of active ingredients, Particular successful results have been obtained with seeds of maize, various vegetables and legumes includir.g soja beans, peas, beans, cucurber, radish melon sunf c er arz also cereals including re and wheat. As compared with previously known seed treatment techniques, the present invention provides significant and unexpected advantages. Using the organic binders described herein, plant protection agents may be applied in very thin coatings which are attached firmly to the seeds. Such coatings, which may have a thickness of 0.02 to 0.2 mm, are very resistant to removal by mechanical forces and by virtue of their thinness may be used for applying fungicides and other agents to large seeds with a negligible increase in their size. The thin coating of this invention covers the entire surface of a seed, even hollows, such as the area around the germ of maize, assuring a high degree of protection. As the coating solution has a low viscosity, and small amounts are applied, the treatment is extremely rapid, so that a high hourly output may be obtained from small installations. Moreover, as the plant protection agents and other additives are applied in a liquid medium, usually in solution, losses through dusting off are non existent. Another advantage, deriving from the use of organic solvents, is rapid drying of the coated seeds.Air at 20 40 0C suffices to dry the seeds in 20 seconds or so and as no water is present there is no danger of causing undesirable swelling of the seeds during treatment. It has also been observed that application of the coating has a beneficial effect on infected or physically damaged maize seed, as is shown by comparison of the germination, plant weight and resistance to fungal attack of treated and untreated infected seed Table I treated untreatedEMI6.1 tb Var.

In the solution described above, the acetone functions as a boiling point depressent, to facilitate solvent elimination. It may be replaced by methylene chloride.

In this latter case, the requirement is for a coating to delay germination so that seeds sown in very cold climates do not emerge prematurely only to be destroyed by frost.
