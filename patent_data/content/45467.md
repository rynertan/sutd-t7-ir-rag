# Picture image display apparatus.

## Abstract
In a multiple electron beam type flat picture image display apparatus, the disposition of the electrode is im proved to the following order linear cathode 14, first deflection electrodes 17 for vertical deflection, control electrodes 23 for control electron beam density, second deflection electrodes 26 for horizontal deflection, acceleration electrodes 28 and an anode 31 of thin metal film formed on the back face on the inner face of phosphor screen 30. Thus, by isolating the vertical deflection electrodes 17 and the horizontal deflection electrodes by the control electrodes 23 disposed in between, and by disposing acceleration electrodes 28 at the final stage of electron beam paths, the distortion of image and smallness of spots are improved and vertical deflection energy becomes smaller.
