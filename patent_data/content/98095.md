# A process and apparatus for identifying or characterizing small particles.

## Abstract
The characterization and or identification of individual microparticles is achieved by measuring certain optical observables produced as each particle passes through a beam of light, or other electromagnetic radiation. A fine beam of, preferably, monocromatic linearly polarized light passes through a spherical array 30 of detectors 8 , or fiber optics means to transmit incident light to a set of detector means, and a stream of particles intersects the beam at the center of the spherical array 30 . Selected observables calculated from the detected scattered radiation are then used to recall specific maps, from a computer memory means 11,22 one for each observable. The common overlap region of said maps yields characterizing or identifying particle physical parameters such as size, mean refractive index, and shape. A method for rapidly discriminating non spherically symmetric particles is also disclosed.
