# A sliding contact type ceramics article and a method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A sliding contact type ceramics article having a high density portion for increasing the mechanical strength of its slide contact portion with an associated article. A method for manufacturing such a sliding contact type ceramics article which is characterized in that, at first a compact body having a configuration which is approximate to a final article is molded in such a manner that a slide contact portion with an associated article is intensively compressed in that manner, that at least a part of the compact body has a compressed density greater than that of the rest of the compact body, and then the compact body is grinded to obtain a compact body of a final configuration.
