## Abstract
A V belt 3 for application on V shaped pulleys 1,2 provided with a plurality of substantially non deformable transverse elements 6 abutting against each other and arranged slideable on an endless carrier 7 . The transverse elements 6 can be made of metal. The carrier 7 may consist of one or two sets of endless metal bands. The V belt 3 is provided with intermediate elements 12 , located along the flanks of the set or sets of bands. So the flanks of the endless bands do not contact the transverse elements 6 , but contact the intermediate elements 12 , extending over more than one transverse element 6 .
