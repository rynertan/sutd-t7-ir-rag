# Method of injecting viscous fluid into a product such as bread or confectionery.

## Abstract
A method of injecting viscous fluid into bread or confectionery is provided. Viscous fluid 2 is drawn by a piston 14 from a hopper 3 through a sport valve 1 into the chamber of a first piston cylinder 13 , and after changing the position of the valve the viscous fluid is extruded through a tube 9 and a receiprocally movable nozzle 11 into a product 10 while the nozzle is being retracted. The relation between the time of retraction of the injection nozzle from bread or confectionery and the stroke and time of extrusion of the piston 14 is adjusted so that the position, amount, and length of the viscous fluid charged in the product can be freely varied.
