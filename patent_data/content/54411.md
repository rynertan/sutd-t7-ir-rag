# Optical arrangement for optically coupling optical fibres.

## Abstract
The optical device comprises tapered birefringent plates 32 and 32 the optical axes of which are rotated one with respect to the other around the direction of travel of light in the device. Between the tapered birefringent plates an element 33 for rotating the plane of polarisation of light passing therethrough is provided. The element 33 may be a 45 Faraday rotator, in which case the device acts as an optical isolator. Alternatively, the element 33 may be an electro optic device, in which case the device acts as a phase difference light intensity converter. The operation of the device is polarisation independent.
