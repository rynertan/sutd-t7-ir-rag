# Feeder for animals.

## Abstract
A feeder unit for animals, particularly pigs, provides feed in either wet or dry condition and comprises a trough 10 and a shelf 31 positioned above the trough with a water supply duct 43 beneath the shelf 31 for directing water through valves 47 actuated by the pig into the trough. A hopper 19 positioned above the shelf directs material continuously onto the shelf 31 to be retained on the shelf by the repose angle. The pig can thus either eat directly from the shelf 31 the feed in dry condition or can brush the feed into the trough 10 for mixing with water and eating in wet condition.
