# High quality delta modulator.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for generating a series of delta modulation data signals corresponding to a predetermined analog waveform wherein an error determination compari son is made on a sequentially generated series of potential delta modulation data signals to determine the optimum pattern of delta modulation bits. The method can be performed in iterative fashion for each delta modulation bit generated.
