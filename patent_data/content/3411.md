# Excess fuel starting device for fuel injection engines.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an excess fuel starting device for a fuel injection engine having a hydraulic actuator 40 to position a full load stop 36 coacting with the engine throttle linkage to control the fuel input from the fuel injection pump to the engine in either a normal run position or an excess fuel position. The actuator includes an excess fuel piston 50 connected to the full load stop and spring biased toward an excess fuel position. A bore 90 within the piston contains a free piston 92 slidable therewithin. Fluid conduit means 102 deliver a pressurised fluid, during engine operation, to actuate only the smaller free piston when the actuator is in the excess fuel position. When the piston 50 has been moved by the action of the free piston 92 to the normal run position, the pressurised fluid provides holding force. The differential in the actuating pressure versus the holding pressure of the device may be varied to suit the installation requirements by the choice of the relative diameters of the pistons 50 and 92 .
