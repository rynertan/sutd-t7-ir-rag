# A METHOD OF STARTING MOTORS BY HARMONICS AND ELECTRICAL MOTORS STARTED BY THIS METHOD

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method of starting motors by harmonics and the synchronous motors, wound rotor and cage rotor asynchronous motors started thereby. During the starting period, according to the present invention, the connection of the stator winding of the motor is changed so as to create some very strong harmonic fields, by means of harmonic fields associated with the rotor winding to improve the starting performance. The characteristics of the three motors which the present invention proposes are of big starting torque, small starting current and can be started by direct on line. To the wound rotor asynchronous motor, brushes, slip rings on the rotor are eliminated and there is not any electric contact whereby to increase the reliability of the starting and running. The running efficiency is also increased to the cage rotor asynchronous motor.

## Claims
1. A method of starting motors with the aid of changing the connection of the stator winding of the motor characterized in that when starting, the stator winding produces one or more very strong harmonic magnetic fields, which are used as starting harmonics there are two or more resistance elements connected firmly with the rotor winding in the rotor, the currents induced by the starting har monic mentioned above should flow through said re ristance elements, but the currents induced by the working magnetic field flow freely not through said resistance elements thus, during the starting, the starting torque increases and the starting current decreases as a result of the combined effect of the starting harmonics produced by the stator and said resistance elements on the rotor when the rotor of the motor is running up and the speed of the motor reaches nearly its rated value, the stator winding of the motor is reconnected according to its normal connection so as to eliminate the starting harmonics mentioned above in this case, the motor is running normally due to the effect of the working magnetic field, and the currents in the rotor flow only through the part of the rotor winding except said resistance elements.

## Description
The present invention relates to a method of starting AC motors and the connection and the construction of the stator and rotor windings of AC motors driven thereby. In order to increase the starting torgue of the motor and to decrease the starting current, a wound rotor or a cage with special slot, such as deep slot or double cage etc., are utilized for an asynchronous motor. To a synchornous motor, a damping cage is used for asynchronous starting at low voltage. At the present, there are many literatures concerning the solution or improvement of the starting torque and starting current, for example, a Chinese publication Technical information of middle and small electric machines 1979, No.1, P. 16 20 and 1980, No. 4, P. 27 30 USSR patent No. 756550, etc. The starting method of a wound rotor asynchronous motor without slip rings and extra starting resistors, which is proposed in Technical information of middle and small electric machines 1979, No. 1 and 1980, No. 4 is to change the connection of rotor windings when the motor starts, whereby to realize the starting and running of the motor by opening and closing three contact points in the rotor winding. Although said motor which is provided by the literature has eliminated the slip rings and the brushes, it is necessary to fix up a means for openning and closing the contact points when the rotor rotates so as to have the construction of the rotor complex and the reliability of running of the motor decrease. Said motor, by means of changing the connection of rotor winding, increases the referred ratio of the rotor impendance to the stator, increase the resistance and the reactance of the rotor referred to the stator side, decreases the starting current and increases the starting torque. However, the starting torque does not increase obviously due to the increase of said reactance and the maxium torque decreases as well, so that it can no be used where a large starting torque is needed. USSR patent No. 756550 provided a proposal of a three function winding for starting, excitation and damping of a four pole synchronous motor. It uses the fundamental wave to start the motor with same pole numbers for starting and running. The three phase winding on the rotor will displace 60 , 60 , 240 electric degree in turn. It is not a symmetric three phase system. Such a motor will provide a large starting torque only when two terminals of DC excitation is short circuited. It is not easy to reach the synchronous speed for heavy load. The heavier the load is, the more difficult to pull into step it is after the DC is applied. In addition, it must start with lower voltage, in order to decrease the starting current, so as to decrease the starting torque. The three function winding of said motor can not be connected with starting resistors in series during the starting period, otherwise it will cause the three phase current more asymmetric. Since the starting current and the direct current excitation of said three function winding goes in the same path and interfere each other, they will not exist at the same time. In brief, said motors and other starting methods which are widely used now have many problems in the manufacture and the running of the motor, such as complicated construction, low reliability of running, high cost, large impulse of current occured in starting process, interference of power network, shortening the service life of the motor, insufficiant starting torque, difficult to pull into step etc. The efficiency of a cage asynchronous motor is not very high because of the large copper loss of the rotor. The task of the present invention is to provide a starting method to overcome the disadvantages of the starting of the motor and to offer a general way to design such windings. According to this design, it will easy to produce a series of motors with simple construction and good starting performance. The starting method of a AC motor will affect directly the performance of the motor, the construction of the motor, and extra apparaus which is needed during the starting process. Finally, it will affect the running performance of the motor and the reliability of whole procedure from starting to running. The current starting method utilized or proposed are not able to offer a good solution to all problems listed above. The object of the present invention is to offer a starting method known as harmonic starting which will meet all requirements comparatively at the same time, to provide three kinds of motors driven thereby. The following three kinds of motors given according to the harmonic starting method of the present invention. The harmonic starting method according to the invention will be described in detail as follows By means of the harmonic starting method in accordiance with this invention, the resistance of the starting resistors of the rotor may be chosen in any value independently, which does not depend on the reactance of the rotor. Therefore, the maximum torque of the motor will be held on its desired value. The starting resistor may be chosen, if necessary, in a way even having the starting torque equals to its maximum torque. Thus, it can be used where a large starting torque and a small starting current are desired. There is no impulse of current too. For said wound rotor asynchronous motor based on the present invention, there is no electric contact point, no slip rings and brushes. It is not necessary to have any extra starting apparatus, such as means for dropping the voltage, frequency convertor and starting rheostat and the like. It will simplify the construction of the rotor and eliminate the possibility of any fault in the rotor circuit so as to increase the reliability of starting and running. It is easy for maintenance. Said rotor of the motor according to this invention adapts for a number of motors with different pole numbers without any modification.What is required for pole changing speed regulation is to change the pole number of the stator only. In comparison with USSR patent No. 756550, the starting method according to this invention may utilize a harmonic for starting, the pole pair of which is one less than that of the fundamental wave. The speed is beyond the synchronous speed of the fundamental wave. When a DC excitation current is applied, it is easy to pull into step. The rotor winding according to the present invention has a quite restricted symmetric three phase system or two phase system whereby to ensure the less harmonic of the rotor and good starting performance during starting period. In accordance with the invention, the starting current and exictation current in the rotor of the synchronous motor will go through two different circuits. They are not affected each other and may exist in common. Therefore, the DC excitation current may be applied to the rotor during the starting process. It is easy for controlling and regulating. Since the starting resistors are fixed on the rotor and a part of the stator winding is closed to the power network and the pole number of the harmonics is less than that of the fundamental, the starting current is small and the voltage dropping device is omitted. the motor can be started by direct on line. The harmonic starting method, the connection and the construction of the stator and rotor winding of the motor according to the present invention will be explained further by reference of the accompanying drawings and embodiments. A number of modes may be used for the harmonic starting. In view of the number of switches needed and the simplicity of the starting operation, the following starting modes are proposed. To different starting mode, there are variety of connection mode of the stator winding of the motor started by the harmonics. Several preferred embodiments of the winding connection modes will be given below in terms of the number of slots and poles. Most of the embodiments listed below are two layer windings with elements of the same shape. Each slot number represents a coil, while a positive slot number represents the normal series connected coil and a negative slot number represents the inverse series connected coil. Only a few embodiments may uas either two layer or single layer winding. if a single layer winding is used, each slot number represents an edge of the coil, wherein the positive ones represent the edges of coils from the front to the rear of the motor and the negative ones represent the edges of the coils from the rear to the front. Therefore, one positive slot number and a negative slot number form a coil. It is so designed for a rotor winding of a wound rotor asynchronous motor for harmonic starting that the current induced by the starting harmonics must flow through the starting resistors to form a path, while the current induced by the fundamental wave will not flow through the starting resistors to form short circuit closed loop. The rotor winding to realize such a design are variaties. The preferred ones will be given below. There is only one winding on the rotor of said non salient pole synchronous motor for the harmonic starting, on which two or more than two resistors are arranged as the starting resistors and two points are connected respectively to two slip rings. It is so designed that the current in the rotor induced by the starting harmonics will go through said starting resistors to form a path while the DC excitation current from said slip rings does not go through said starting resistors, whereby to form a path itself. In this case, it is required to produce a very strong magnetic field with fundamental poles by having a DC excitation current passes through said windings. On the other hand, it is required that the electromotive forces induced in the rotor by the fundamental field creates a poly phase current so as to damp the oscillation of said motor. The preferred proposal of the connect ion of rotor winding suit for these requirement mentioned above is shown in Fig. 19. The rotor winding is divided into six sections A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 , C1 , C2 , which form two face to face star connections. There are three starting resistors Rst connected to three join points M, N, F in Fig. 19, while the neutral points S The cage rotor of an asynchronous motor for harmonic starting consists of conducting bars 2 and one or more than one end ring 1 welded firmly to the bars. The end ring 1 is made from high resistance material, which is used as the starting resistors. Many connecting pieces 3 made from low resistance material are fixed on both opposite sides of the high resistance end ring 1 , each of which short circuits two conducting bars 2 . It should be designed in the way as follows the current in the rotor induced by the starting harmonics must go through said high resistance end ring 1 to form a path while the current induced by the fundamental field goes through said conducting bars 2 and said connecting pieces 3 , as well as low resistance end ring, if any, to form a closed loop with low resistance. The arrangement of the connecting pieces on said high resistance end ring 1 is shown as Fig. 24, and Fig. 25, wherein the arrangement of Fig. 24 is used for a motor with the pole number 2P 2 and the arrangement of Fig. 25 is used for other with different pole number. The number and length of said connecting pieces will be changed only when the pole number and slot number are different from the other. The further explaination will be given below by three kinds of embodiments.
