## Description
CYCLOHEXANE CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND DERIVATIVES THEREOF AS ANTIDYSRHYTHMIC AGENTS IR.2594 Introduction and Background The present invention provides a novel class of cyclohexane nitriles and carboxylic acids, and amides and esters thereof that are useful as antidysrhythmic agents.While the art teaches cyclohexane compounds structurally related, as in U.S. 3,974,157 and British 615,136, neither teaches an analogue bearing a carboxyl, carboxyester, amide or nitrile group on the number one carbon of the cyclohexane ring. The Invention The present invention pertains to new cyclohexane compounds of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is from the class of cyano, carboxyl, alkylcarboxylate, carboxamido, N alkyl carboxamido andN,N dialkylcarboxamido, RZ and R3 are from the class of hydrogen, cycloalkyl and lower alkyl with the proviso that such alkyl groups may be linked to form a heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen, R4 is from the class of hydrogen and hydroxyl and n is a small whole number. The formula is intended to represent the racemic, optically active and stereoisomeric forms, all of which are comprehended with the present invention. Being organic bases, these compounds readily form salts with organic and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, maleic, tartaric, and other non toxic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The esters of these compounds in particular are effective at a relatively low dosage level in the prevention of the onset of arrn hnsas and also ifl he reversal of arrhythmias in warm blooded animals and thus possess activity useful for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in humans. A particularly satisfactory compound is that of the formula broadly represented structurally above in which R1 is lower alkylcarboxylate, R2 and R3 are hydrogen or lower alkyl, R4 is hydroxyl and n is less that about 5. Processes for Production The compounds of this invention can be prepared in several ways, and the following schemes, A, B and C represent the processes illustrated in the present application, the term 1,ac 1 representing lower alkyl carboxylate. Scheme AEMI4.1 In Scheme A, ethyl 2 oxocyclohexanecarboxylate I I can be condensed with acrylonitrile in the presence of base to form ethyl l cyanoethyl 2 oxocyclohexanecarboxylate it . Treatment of this ester with an aryl magnesium halide or an aryl lithium yields the corresponding ethyl 2 aryl l cyanoethyl 2 hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate III .This nitrile can be reduced to the 3 aminopropyl derivative IV which in turn can be alkylated to the substituted amino derivative V with an alkyl halide or according to theEschweiler Clarke reaction with formaldehyde formic acid to give V. In Scheme B, below, the keto ester I is reacted with allyl bromide in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or lithium dicyclohexylamide to yield the allyl derivative VI which can in turn be reacted with an arylGrignard or aryl lithium derivative to form the ethyl l allyl Z aryl 2 hydroxycyclohexane carboxylate VII . Treatment of this olefin with borane in THF followed by iodine in the presence of sodium methoxide affords the 3 iodopropyl derivative VIII which can then be aminated with an amine such as dimethylamine to give, as shown below, the same ester V obtained in scheme A. Scheme BEMI6.1 Scheme C, set forth below, is used in preparing the compounds of Examples 4 to 6 incl., in which R4 is hydrogen Scheme CEMI7.1 In Scheme C the 2 phenylcyclohexane carboxylic acid ester IX is reacted with allyl bromide in the presence of a base such as lithium diisopropylamide to yield the allyl derivative X which is treated with borane and then bromine to give the 3 bromopropyl derivative XI . Alternatively XI is obtained from IX directly by alkylation with 1,3 dibromopropane. The bromide XI on treatment with sodium azide followed by catalytic hydrogenation affords the primary amine XII . Secondary and tertiary amines XIII can be obtained by direct amination of the bromide XI with the appropriate amine, R2R3NH.
