# Attaching post for snap fastener elements.

## Abstract
An attaching device 10 for attaching a socket member 28 of a snap fastener to a garment has a post 12 having a circular flange 13 extending from a cylindrical stem 12 and a cap 14 mounted thereon. The circular flange 13 has a central portion 17 , an intermediate inclined annular step 18 , a radially outward annular shoulder 19 , and a plurality of radial ribs 20 extending radially inwardly from an end 15 of the stem 12 to the inclined annular step 18 . The central portion 17 of the flange 13 has a surface 25 adjacent to the inclined annular step 18 and held against a rounded wall 21 of the cap 14 . The end 15 of the post 12 is axially spaced from the rounded wall 21 of the cap 14 with a clearance 27 left therebetween The annular shoulder 19 of the flange 13 is locked in position by an annular curled rim 24 of the cap 14 . Any impact force applied when the attaching device 10 is staked on the socket member 28 is distributed uniformly to the flange 13 , preventing the cap 14 from being deformed.
