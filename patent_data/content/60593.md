# Corona device.

## Abstract
Corona device comprising a number of electrode pins 1 in a body 2 of insulating material. Each pin 1 projects at two sides beyond the body 2 of insulating material. The body of insulating material is placed be tween two electrodes 3, 6 , which are connectable to the poles of a voltage source 7 , in such a way that the ends of each pin 1 are in the electric field between the electrodes 3, 6 at locations between which a high potential difference is present. Between each end of a pin and the corresponding electrode a corona discharge develops.
