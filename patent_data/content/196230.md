# Method of manufacturing a multilayer capacitor.

## Abstract
A method for processing a layered structure 12 incor porating alternating plastic film and electrically conductive layers to enhance its thermal and capacitive stability in which the plastic film has molecular bonds oriented in a first axis and a second axis, comprises the step of applying a compressive force F to the structure in a third axis which is substantially perpendicular to the first and second axes, and heating the structure to a processing temperature. The processing temperature is sufficiently high to randomize the molecular bonds and is maintained for a processing time sufficient to effect randomization of substantially all of the molecular bonds in the structure. The structure is then allow ed to substantially cool to ambient temperature before re moving the compressive force from it.
