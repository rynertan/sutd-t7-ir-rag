# Process for applying a coating to a substrate.

## Abstract
A process is provided for applying a coating to a substrate by bringing the substrate into contact with a liquid aqueous coating composition comprising a solid powdered epoxy group containing compound having a number average molecular weight of at least 1000, an epoxy equivalent weight of 450 7 500 and an average article size of 0,5 35 Âµm, dispersed in an aqueous medium containing an ionized polyamino compound hav ing primary or secondary groups, the ratio of the number of reactive groups of the polyamino compound to the number of epoxy groups of the epoxy compound being at least 0,4. The coating composition is applied to the substrate at a temperature of 5 65 C and the resulting coating layer is cured at a temperature of 70 220 C. This invention also relates to the liquid aqueous coating composition to be used in said process.
