# Closure for pressure container and neck member therefor.

## Abstract
A removable closure for a pressure container 2 having an opening 6 with a peripheral bead 7 into which there is inserted a threaded neck member 9 , the neck member being formed of a resilient plastics material adapted to expand and contract and having an interlocking engagement with the bead. The neck 9 is provided with a radially extending handle portion 17 by means of which the container 2 is adapted to be carried and which also serves to prevent rotation of the neck member 9 upon the application and threading of a cap 25 to the neck member 9 , the cap having a plug portion 36 which enters into the opening 43 in the neck member 9 and, being tapered, wedges into the neck member 9 and spreads the portion of the neck member which is in radial alignment with the bead portion, thus tightly forcing such portion against the bead to provide a high pressure seal. The plug portion 36 is provided with pressure relief grooves 52 at its inner end 54 extending axially of the plug such that as the cap 25 is being unscrewed from the neck portion 9 , the grooves 52 are positioned to communicate the interior of the container 2 with a space 43 between the interior of the neck and the plug outwardly of the interlocking portion so that the excess pressure can bleed off to the atmosphere about the threads. The invention also comprises novel pilfer proof mechanism 60, 70 which has to be broken away from the cap 25 in order to unscrew the cap and therefore readily is indicative of tampering.
