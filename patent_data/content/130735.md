The term lower alkenyln as used herein means straight chain alkenyl radicals containing from two to six carbon atoms and branched chain alkenyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes ethenyl, 2 methyl 2propenyl, 4 hexenyl and the like. The term lower alkynyl as used herein means straight chain alkynyl radicals containing from two to six carbon atoms and branched chain alkynyl radicals containing four to six carbon atoms and includes ethynyl, 2 propynyl, 1methyl 2 propynyl, 3 hexynyl and the like. The term cyclotlower alkyl as used herein means saturated cyclic hydrocarbon radicals containing from three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The term lower alkanol as used herein means both straight and branched chain alkanols containing from one to four carbon atoms and includes methanol, ethanol, l methylethanol, butanol and the like. Ther term inorganic proton acceptor as used herein means the inorganic bases, preferably the alkali metyl hydroxides, alkoxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, sodium methoxide and the like. The compounds of this invention are capable of forming acid addition salts with therapeutically acceptable acids. The acid addition salts are prepared by reacting the base form of the appropriate compound of formula I with one or more equivalents, preferably with an excess, of the appropriate acid in an organic solvent, for example, diethyl ether or an ethanol diethyl ether mixture. These salts, when administered to a mammal, possess the same pharmacologic activities as the corresponding bases. For many purposes it is preferable to administer the salts rather than the basic compounds.Suitable acids to form these salts include the common mineral acids, e.g.hydrohalic, sulfuric or phosphoric acid the organic acids, e.g. maleic, citric or tartaric acid and acids which are sparingly soluble in body fluids and which impart slow release properties to their respective salts, e.g. pamoic or tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose. The addition salts thus obtained are the functional equivalent of the parent base compound in respect to their therapeutic use. Hence, these addition salts are included within the scope of this invention and are limited only by the requirement that the acids employed in forming the salts be therapeutically acceptable. The compounds of formula I in which R2 is oxo or thioxo are also capable of forming addition salts with sodium or potassium. These salts are prepared by reacting the latter compounds of formula I with one or more equivalents of sodium or potassium, or a strong base of sodium or potassium, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium t butoxide, sodium hydride and the like. These salts, like the acid addition salts, when administered to a mammal possess the same pharmacological activities as the corresponding nonsalt compound of formula I. The compounds of formula I or a therapeutically acceptable addition salt thereof are useful as cardiotonic agents for increasing cardiac contractility in a mammal. The cardiotonic effect is demonstrated in standard pharmacological tests, for example, in causing an increase in the contractile force of the isolated cat papillary muscle and reversal of pentobarbital induced cardiac failure in the dog. The compounds of formula I of this invention are used alone or in combination with pharmacologically acceptable carriers, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration and standard biological practice. For example, they are administered orally in the form of suspensions or solutions or they may be injected parenterally. For parenteral administration they can be used in the form of a sterile solution containing other solutes, for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The tablet compositions contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of tablets. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients are, for example, starch, milk sugar, certain types of clay and so forth. The tablets can be uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques so as to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. The aqueous suspensions of the compounds of formula I contain the active ingredient in admixture with one or more non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Suitable excipients are, for example, methylcellulose, sodium alginate, gum acacia, lecithin and so forth. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents. Non aqueous suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin, and the suspension may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. These compositions can also contain a sweetening agent, flavoring agent and antioxidant. The dosage of the compounds of formula I as cardiotonic agents will vary with the form of administration and the particular compound chosen.Furthermore, it will vary with the particular host as well as the age, weight and condition of the host under treatment as well as with the nature and extent of the symptoms. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum nose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compounds of this invention are most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects. For example, the effective cardiotonic amount of the compounds for oral administration can usually range from about 0.05 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses although as aforementioned variations will occur.However, a dosage level that is in the range of from about 0.2 to 20 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses is employed most desirably for oral administration in order to achieve effective results. The compounds of formula I also can be used to produce beneficial effects in the treatment of congestive heart failure when combined with a therapeutically effective amount of another agent commonly used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Such agents include, for example vasodilators, i.e. isosorbide dinitrate, captopril, nifedipine, hydralazine and prazosin diuretics, i.e. hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide and spironolactone and other cardiotonics, i.e. digitalis and dobutamine. A combination of the above agents can be substituted for a single agent. Suitable methods of administration, compositions and dosages of the agents are well known in the art for instance, Physican Desk Reference , 37 ed., Medical EconomicsCo., Oradell, N.J., U.S.A., 1983. When used in combination, the compound of formula I is administered as described previously. The invention also provides processes for preparing the compounds of formula I.

Compounds of formula I wherein X is thioxo may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIIEMI10.2 wherein R1, R4 to R9,m and n are as defined above and R3 is cyano, nitro methylsulfonyl or amino sulfonyl, with an aqueous ethanol solution of potassium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide. Compounds of formula VII as defined above may be reacted with a solution of an inert organic solvent containing an excess of ammonia to give a corresponding compound of formula I wherein R2is imino. Reaction scheme I illustrates a method for preparing the compounds of formula I Reaction Scheme 1EMI11.1 I in which Rê is oxo and R is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl With reference to reaction scheme 1, the amidine of formulaII in which R1 is as defined herein is condensed with compound of formulaIII in which R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R10 is lower alkyl to obtain the pyrimidine of formula W in which R1 is as defined herein and R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl according to the method described by S. Kisaki et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 22, 2246 1974 .This condensation is preferably achieved by reacting about equimolar amounts of the compounds of formulae II and m in the presence of an inorganic proton acceptor, for example, sodium hydride, sodium alkoxide or potassium carbonate, in an inert organic solvent, for example, ethanol or dimethyl formamide, at about 20 to 900 C for about two to ten hours. Reaction of the pyrimidine of formula IV in which R1 is es defined herein and R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl with the amine of formula V in which R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein gives the corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is oxo, R3 is cyano1 nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R1, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein. About one to five equivalents of the amine of formula V are usually used and the reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent, preferably l,2 dimethoxyethane, at about 50 to 1000 C for about l0 to 30 hours. Reaction Scheme 2 illustrates another method for preparing some of the compounds of formula I Reaction Scheme 2EMI12.1 I in which R2 is oxo and R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl oz aminosulfonyl With reference to reaction scheme 2, the compound of formula m in which R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R10 is lower alkyl is reacted with the amine of formula V in which R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein to obtain the corresponding compound of formula VI in which R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R4 to R10, m and n are as defined herein.For this reaction, preferably about equimolar amounts of the compounds of formulae m and V are allowed to react at about 20 to 400 C for about ten minutes to two hours in an inert organic solvent, preferably dimethoxyethane, and the compound of formula VI is isolated. Condensation of the compound of formula VI in which R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R4 to R10, m and n are as defined herein with the amidine of formula II in which R1 is as defined herein gives the corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is oxo R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R1, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein. When conducting this condensation, preferably about equal molar amounts of the compounds of formula II and VI are condensed at about 75 to 1500 C for about 20 to 30 hours in an inert organic solvent, preferably dim ethylformamide. To convert the compound of formula I in which R2 is oxo to the corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is thioxo, the following chemical reactions are required. In the first step, the sodium salt of the compound of formula I in which R2 is oxo is reacted with an excess of phosphorous oxychloride at about 90 to 1200 C for about one to five hours to obtain the corresponding 4 chloropyrimidine derivative. Treatment of the latter derivative with a solution of water and ethanol containing an excess of potassium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide at about 20 to 400 C for about 20 to 30 hours gives the corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is thioxo R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and R1, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein. Treatment of the above 4 chloropyrimidine with a solution of an inert organic solvent, preferably a lower alkanol, containing an excess of ammonia at about 50 to 800 C for about 20 to 30 hours gives the corresponding compound of formula I in which R2 is imino R3 is cyano, nitro, methylsulfonyl or aminosulfonyl and RÚ, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein. Hydrolysis of the compound of formula I in which R is cyano and RÚ, Rê, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein, preferably with sulfuric acid at about 60 to 1000 C for one to ten hours, gives the corresponding compound of formula I in which R3 is aminocarbonyl and R1, R2, R4 to R9, m and n are as defined herein.

The heart was rapidly removed and placed in cool Tyrode s solution which had been equilibrated with 95 02 5 CO2. The right ventricle was opened by cutting down the sides and around the apex so that the free wall could be folded back on the atriventricular groove. Usually at least three suitably sized papillary muscles were found 1 mm or less in thickness . Threads were tied around the chordae tendonae and the base f the muscle just above its point of insertion into the ventricular walL The chordae were cut, and the muscle was removed along with a small button of ventricular wall.If a sufficient number of papillary muscles were not present, trabeculae carnae could also be used. The best ones were usually found inserting just under the valve. The preparations were mounted in tissue baths containing Tyrode s solution at 370C bubbled with 95 02 5 CO2.

Both femoral veins were cannulated.One cannula was used for infusion of pentobarbital to induce and maintain failure, the other for injection of test compounds. A cannula was inserted into the aorta via a femoral artery and the cannula was attached to a blood pressure transducer for measurement of systolic, diastolic and mean aortic blood pressure. A Millar pressure tip catheter was inserted into the other femoral artery and advanced into the left ventricle to record intraventricular pressure and dP dt. Subdermal needle electrodes were used to record a lead II electrocardiogram and heart rate. Following a stabilization period of at least 30 min, experimental failure was induced by the i.v. infusion of Na pentobarbital, 0.75 mg kg min in 0.2 mL of saline min, until a 40 50 decrease in peak positive dP dt was obtained. The failure state was maintained at this level throughout the experiment by continuous infusion of Na pentobarbital, 0.11 0.15 mg kg min.
