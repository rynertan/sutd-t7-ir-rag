# Micro arc welding brazing of metal to metal and metal to ceramic joints.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for micro arc welding brazing of metal to metal or metal to ceramic joints are described. The control of arc heat flux density is accomplished by controlling the ambient gas pressure and providing an argon, argon 5 hydrogen, or other inert gas atmosphere. The dis charge current is controlled so as to provide an arc which is operable at 100 microamps to 20 amps. Prior to welding or brazing, the work is cleaned by high frequency electrical discharge cleaning techniques using high energy ions from either the ambient gas or from an electrode. By providing a small amount of DC during the high frequency discharge a tinning capability is established. The welding or brazing may be performed in a closed chamber 109 so that arc stabilization, between the lug 101 on anode mount 113 and the cathode 115, can be accomp lished.

## Description
MICRO ARC WELDING 3RAZING OF METAL TO METAL AND METAL TO CERAMIC JOINTS This invention relates to micro arc welding brazing of metal to metal and metal to ceramic joints. Machinery and electronic devices are becoming more and more sophisticated at an extremely rapid rate.An important element of this sophistication is the need to join metal to metal and metal to ceramic parts by more reliable and reproducible methods, often at high temperature over 10000C and often without the use of flux or other chemical cleaning processes. A proliferation of techniques have been developed to meet these needs. These include but are not limited to high temperature vacuum and inert gas furnace brazing electron beam brazing and welding laser beam brazing and welding spot welders and brazers ultrasonic bonders heli arc machines acetylene torches mechanical bonding using electromagnetic forces soldering irons and guns plasmatrons or plasmajets ion beams. For the most part, these developments have been empirical. Many of them also have one or more of the following undesirable characteristics require specialized, expensive equipment require highly trained personnel to operate, i.e. cannot be machine programmed do not give reproducible results require the use of chemical cleaning agents which can contaminate critical components and limit the lifetime of the device each new joint must be developed through the use of many samples which can be very expensive and time consuming lack of temperature control can cause unaccept able thermal stresses, unacceptable recrystall ization in components, damage to neighboring components. In any brazing or welding operation, some provision must be made to accomplish the following processes i mechanically join or position the parts to be brazed or welded ii choose an optimum braze material iii properly position the right amount of braze and weld material or arrange to feed it at the proper rate during brazing or welding iv establish a non corrosive atmosphere v clean, selectively if possible, the surfaces that are to be joined vi if the parts are to be brazed, wet or coat the appropriate surfaces with a thin layer of material, usually the same as the braze material vii heat the desired surfaces to the optimum temperature at the optimum rate viii ensure that the braze or weld material flows to the desired location ix cool the joint at an optimum rate. Ensuring that the steps outlined above are done in the proper sequence is extremely important in most cases. For instance, if the braze melts and flows before the surfaces are cleaned and wetted, it will ball up and often fall off of the metal parts or move to some undesirable position. There is little or no problem associated with accomplishing steps i and iv in proper sequence. However, steps v through viii are often all accomplished by applying heat to the joint. Ensuring that these steps are effected in the proper sequence becomes one of the prime requirements of the heating system. There is, however, some flexibility in the sequencing of these steps. Besides ensuring the proper time sequencing of the steps noted above, the steps are strongly coupled so that any change in one step could strongly influence any of the other steps. For instance, heating in a vacuum furnace rather than a hydrogen furnace could alter the decisions that must be made to properly accomplish steps ii, v, vi, viii, and ix. Until now, the physics and physical processes that determine the multiple interactions and proper sequencing of events during brazing or welding often have not been identified or even well understood. This is especially true in cases where an electrical discharge is used to supply the heat, because of the notorious perversityn of arc discharges. Great strides, however, have been made in understanding and optimizing arc electrical discharge phenomena over the past 20 years. Many of these developments were accomplished in areas of technology not familiar to the average arc welding expert, e.g. space propulsion engines. Often, these developments were not reported in the open literature, and hence this information was confined to a small group of plasma physicists.This can account for the almost universal use of primitive arc devices and technology in most present day heli arc operations, as well as heli arcing being more a black art rather than a well established technological process. As stated above, rapid developments in other areas of technology as well can have profound implications towards the development of a scientific approach to welding and brazing. Specifically, the significant advances in our understanding of physi and chemi sorbed layers and how to control them, have been made by scientists working in the space program. High speed, high capacity computers have made the solution of complicated heat transfer problems routine. The development of solid state devices and associated electronics now permit better than 1 control of current, voltage or power in direct current power supplies. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a precisely controlled method and apparatus for welding and brazing small components. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for welding and brazing using arc currents which are precisely controlled so as to permit fusion or bonding at a specified limited area which can be made smaller and can be more accurately predetermined than had been hithertofore possible. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for welding or brazing joints within a small confined area while minimizing the thermal stresses which would normally occur in the surrounding area. It is a further object of the invention to provide an arc welding and brazing technique wherein the arc is maintained in a stable condition, even at low current values. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for arc welding or brazing wherein physical properties of the arc are pre calculated in order to provide a stabilized arc at a minimum of temperature and current. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus wherein an arc is stabilized by controlling the arc current in accordance with the physical properties of the arc and by providing a vortex gas flow around the arc. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus wherein an arc is provided with an enveloping gas which has controlled flow characteristics. It is a further object of the invention to provide the method and apparatus for stabilizing an arc used for welding and brazing wherein the arc is maintained in a stabilized condition, even at relatively low current values, by maintaining a vortex in an enveloping gas which has high speed flow characteristics. It is a further object of the invention to provide an apparatus which is adaptable to welding at relatively high voltages and low current values so as to provide a stabilized arc wherein the current value, gas pressure, time of arc discharge, and cathode diameter and temperature are calculated in accordance with the physical properties of the arc and materials prior to welding. It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a means for welding small components in limited space, while providing a relatively high strength for the resultant weld joint. It is yet a further object of the invention to provide an apparatus which is capable of welding and or brazing wherein the weld takes place over a small predefined area. It is yet a further object of the invention to provide an apparatus where a high speed vortex can be provided in an enveloping gas to facilitate the welding and or brazing of materials with a carefully controlled arc. It is still another object of the invention to provide a product having a welded joint, which joint is limited in size and high in mechanical strength. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, a method is provided wherein a current level necessary to heat a material to a desired temperature for welding and or brazing with an arc includes the steps of determining an effective radius for a fused joint, determining the current, pressure level and time necessary to obtain a desired temperature of fusion, and determining a cathode radius necessary to maintain thermionic emission from the cathode. The work is then positioned in a jflg, the pressure is established and the fusion site is heated to the desired temperature, with an arc maintained for a precisely controlled amount of time. The work may be surrounded by an inert enveloping gas and the gas may be caused to flow at a high speed vortex with speeds near the center of the vortex approaching MACH one.When the vortex gas flow is used, the enveloping gas flow carries vaporized material away from the work. In a further aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for thermally fusing electroconductive materials together by applying an electric arc to the materials wherein stabilized current is provided at a value which is predetermined in accordance with pressure and required energy discharge, with the current being maintained for a precisely controlled period of time. A means is provided for enveloping the materials with a substantially inert gas which may also have reducing properties. The apparatus may cause the enveloping gas to flow in a vortex around the materials at a high rate of speed. In another aspect of the ihvÃ«ntion, an arc welded or brazed fused joint having a precisely controlled area of fusion and relatively high strength is formed by thermally fusing at least some of the materials in the joint by steps which include determining an effective radius for the fused joint, as well as the current, pressure level and time necessary to obtain a desired temperature of fusion, and determining a cathode radius necessary to maintain thermionic emission from the cathode.The fused joint may be surrounded by an inert enveloping gas during the fusion and the gas may be caused to flow at a high speed vortex with speeds near the center of the vortex approaching MACH one. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 shows a graphical display of non dimensional time for heating the work vs. ratio of thermal conduction heat loss to total heat loss for a typical material, in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 shows a graphical display of rod diameters vs. current for different times to heat the rod in accordance with the invention Fig. 3 shows a graphical display of rod diameters vs. current for different rod temperatures in accordance with the invention Fig. 4 is a combined graphical display showing the information of Figs. 2 and 3 Fig. 5 shows a jig used to braze two wires within an insulator according to one aspect of the invention Fig. 6 shows sn arrangement for joining two wires in an insulator prior to a brazing operation according to the present invention Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view taken along section 7 7 of Fig. 6 Fig. 8 shows the arrangement of Fig. 6 after having been brazed in the jig of Fig. 5 Fig. 9 shows a jig for welding two nichrome wires together in accordance with the present invention Fig. 10 is a top view showing details of the jig of Fig. 9 Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view, taken along section 11 11 of Fig. 10 Fig. 12 shows two nichrome wires encased in a sheath to be joined in accordance with the present invention Fig. 13 shows the nichrome wires of Fig. 12 after having been joined in the jig of Fig. 9 Fig. 14 shows a jig for brazing a lug onto an insulated wire in accordance with the present invention Fig. 15 shows details of the jig of Fig. 14 showing a mounting assembly for brazing the lug and, Figs. 16 and 17 show the lug before and after, respectively, being brazed in the jig of Fig. 14. The present invention takes advantage of the fact that physical properties of an arc, as well as the physical properties of materials being heated by an arc for thermal fusion welding and or brazing can be fairly accurately calculated. While these calculations must be performed for each type of job, most commercial applications of thermal fusion involve repeat operations in which a large number of preferably identical parts are produced. In order to minimize the size of a fused portion of the material to be joined hereinafter called work , the arc current is maintained at a level slightly above a pre determined minimum current required to melt the fusion materials and to raise the temperature of the materials to be fused to the desired temperature at the location of the fusion. The fusion materials normally are either braze or the puddle portion melted material of the weldment. In order to use this minimum current level, it is necessary to provide the current in an environment which would tend to stabilize the arc, rather than permit the arc to destabilize and rapidly move around a desired arc attachment point at the work. As with conventional arc welding, an arc is dis charged from a welding rod or cathode to an anode attachment point on the work. Sufficient current is caused to flow through the cathode and onto the anode attachment point to stabilize the arc and to cause thermionic emission from the cathode. In order to minimize this current, it is necessary to determine five parameters which must be properly controlled in order to accomplish any specific welding or brazing job. These quantities are 1 the discharge current, I 2 the ambient pressure of inert gas, p 3 the time over which the discharge current flows, t 4 the cathode diameter, dk and, 5 the temperature of the cathode, Tk. These quantities are functions of the physical properties of the material to be welded or brazed, of the ambient inert gas, and of the size and properties of the materials involved in the braze or weld. In conventional arc welding techniques, the arc is stabilized by maintaining a relatively high discharge current. High discharge current ensures that the arc will be stable at atmospheric pressure with a large variety of cathode diameters. The materials welded by conventional techniques are usually relatively thick, thereby eliminating the need to control the time over which the discharge current flows. Because of the large current flow of conventional welding apparatus, it is not necessary to maintain the current in a relatively smooth or predictable wave form.That is significant because the electrical impedance across the arc is widely variable, thus resulting in wildly erratic fluctuation in arc current over short time periods, even though the average current value remains constant. In order to reduce the arc current level, it is necessary to eliminate the radical fluctuations which normally occur in arc discharge devices. This is, of course, facilitated by the fact that significantly lower currents are being used. While stable current generators are readily commercially available, it is possible to construct such a stable current supply by using a high voltage power source capable of supplying current at at least the desired levels, combined with a bank of resistors such as an adjustable carbon pile. The carbon pile can be adjusted to a desired closed circuit current.If the resistance of the resistors is significantly greater than the impedance across the arc, then changes in the arc impedance will be relatively insignificant and therefore will not cause any significant changes in the output current as long as the arc is maintained. When it is desired to fusion bond a particular joint in accordance with the invention, it is first necessary to measure the size of the joint and assign it to the following quantities M Mass of material that must be raised to the desired temperature AR Surface area of material that will be radiating power AC Cross sectional area through which heat is conducted away from the joint material and, Leff Effective conduction length average length over which heat is conducted.It is also necessary to determine the melting temperatureTm of the brazed or weld material. A ratio alpha of power conducted by the are to total power losses at the anode attachment point is then determined, using the following formula EMI11.1 heat heat flux potential for materialEMI11.2 El emissivity of material a Stefan Boltzman constant for black body radiation Tm melting point of braze or weld material 0 Ta ambient temperature K 0 Tm melting temperature of the material K. If a brazing operation is to be performed Tm is the melting temperature of the solder or braze material and, K thermal conductivity constant. A non dimensionalized temperature value Twfor the values of alpha is computed by the following formula EMI11.3 where N is the proportion of equilibrium temperature selected as a minimum working temperature. In the preferred embodiment, N is 0.8, representing 80 equilibrium temperature. A heating time tw must be precisely controlled in cases where a minimum size of a fused joint is desired.The heating time twduring which current is to flow is calculated by the following formula EMI11.4 where Mi mass of species, i and, s i enthalpy of species i, including heat of fusion where appropriate. The required current value I, required to accomplish the desired weld or braze is established in accordance with EMI12.1 where 6 parameter less than unity defining a proportion of electron energy discharged at the anode attachment point of the work VI ionization potention of gas or vapor near attachment zone to work w work function or work material and,EMI12.2 The required ambient pressure level atm required to establish the desired surface area of arc attachment or heating is EMI12.3 where k Boltzmann constant p pressure level Pa atmospheric pressure cross section for atom0electron collisions E0 capacitivity of vacuum m mass of the electron and, e electric charge the electron This establishes the pressure, current and time required for a given weld. The next steps are associated with choosing a cathode diameter dk, such that the cathode is heated to value Tk, to ensure adequate thermionic emission from the tip of the cathode in a time tk, much shorter than the time required to heat the work, tw Put t sst, where ss proportionality constant, less than unity.Using the values of electric current, I, and heating time, tw, the cathode parameters are established using the following equations EMI13.1 where Ta Teq tk tref Ta ambient temperature EMI13.2 resistivity of cathode T T linearly dependent on the absolute temperature Stefan Boltzmann constant for black body radiation EMI13.3 Pk density of cathode material and,Cp specific heat of cathode material. While the above calculations appear to be quite complex, the calculations would normally be performed by a computer, with the formulae incorporated into an appropriate program. Alternatively, most of the information may be graphically reproduced, either on a computer display or on paper as shown in the following Examples, reference being made to the accompanying drawings. EXAMPLE 1 Fig. 1 shows the relationship of tw to for a particular material, with N 0.9 90 equilibrium temperature . In this example, if alpha is established at 0.55, then w could be read at 1.5, thus providing a value for Twwithout resorting to individual calculations. EXAMPLE 2 Fig. 2 shows the relationships of cathode rod diameter dk and current at different times tk chosen for cathode heating. Choosing a small rod will reduce the time to heat the rod. Fig. 3 shows the relationships of cathode rod diameter dk and current at different rod temperatures Tk. Tk must be less than the melting temperature of the rod, but sufficient to produce thermionic emission. Since clearly the rod temperature Tk and the time to heat the rod tk are interrelated, both being dependent on rod diameter as a function of current, the values Tk and tk may be shown on the same display, as seen in Fig. 4. If the values tk and Tk cannot be chosen within acceptable limits and the choice of rod materials e.g., tungsten does not place the values tk and Tk within acceptable limits, a different pressure is chosen, the change in pressure being effected either by vortex flow or by static pressure controls. The change in pressure results primarily in a different current value. A radio frequency signal can be provided at the cathode, which would be transmitted to the work in order to cause localized heating and etch the surface of the work. The etching function is significant in that surface oxides can be removed by pre treating the work with radio frequency, thereby performing a cleaning step during which the enveloping gas may be applied, if beneficial, as in the case of aluminium. The localized heating function of the radio frequency energy enables a reduction in thermal stress caused by the arc fusion. A closely related function is the use of the radio frequency energy to heat treat metal, usually to temper the joint after fusion, by relieving molecular stress in the metal. Typically radio frequency energy would be applied after the work is placed in a jig and the parameters such as cathode diameter have been established. The radio frequency energy at this point is primarily used for cleaning, although some pre heating of the work advantageously occurs. The use of radio frequency for cleaning is also important in applications where the use of a flux would be undesirable. By providing an electrode of a suitable material, a tinning capability is provided wherein, by including a DC component in the radio frequency current, the work is coated with some of the electrode material. After arc fusion is effected, the radio frequency energy would be immediately applied to permit a slower cooling of the work, more even heat distribution during the cooling process and relief of molecular stresses at the joint. Thus, the heat treatment occurs when the joint remains hot from the arc fusion. The following Examples are demonstrative of the application of the techniques of the present invention.These Examples appertain to an experimental program rather than to the application of the invention on a commercial scale however, the Examples demonstrate some of the advantages and results of the invention EXAMPLE 3 High Temperature Joint 41 with a Very Small Diameter Wire 43 in an Insulator 45 in a Jig 47 Figs. 5 8 .A Objective 1 Hi temp braze together a .009 d platinum wire 49 to a .0025 d W3Rh tungsten wire 43. The latter is wrapped with a .003 d W3Rh tungsten wire 51 and .003 d Palco wire 53. The joint 41 is blind , i.e. in both of two holes is .017 d 55 of a two bore 1 16 diameter piece of alumina 45. 2 Use Palco Braze. Liquidus 12350C or 22550F Solidus 12300C or 22460FB Constraints 1 Must maintain electrical insulation between two holes 2 Must maintain insulations of over 100 Meghoms between joint and a metal cylinder sleeve 57 shown in Fig. 5 or the insulator 45 but moved away from the holes 55 placed later over the alumina 3 Cannot use flux for cleaning 4 Joint 41 must carry 0.5 amps of current for over 100 hours at temperatures of over 8000C 5 May open slit through alumina for access to joint, but must later cover with the metal cylinder 57 6 Whole assembly cannot be heated to over 4250C.C Prior Art Alternate Approaches to Micro Arc that were Tried Electron beam welding only. Electron beam welding produced joints with no better than 60 success ratio.Problems included burned and cracked alumina non satisfactory braze even after several attempts burned through tungsten wire 43 balled Palco 53 which contacted the metal cylinder 57 when placed over alumina 45 and contaminated alumina walls in cavity, resulting in unacceptable insulation resistance. The resultant joints were considered non reproducable, and therefore the electron beam is technically not feasible for this type application on a commercial scale.D Application of Micro Arc 1 The jig 47 was constructed in a housing not shown which was evacuated and provided with an argon 95 5 hydrogen enveloping gas at 800 torr, creating a vortex flow around the joint 41 and a cathode 59. The jig had a spring loaded rod holder 62, permitting a touching of electrodes to initiate the arc. 2 The technique was developed to the point where it has a 95 success ratio, with one fusion attempt only. This was developed with several hundred samples. The procedure is automated, requiring no extensive special skills or expensive equipment. A technician must have experience working with miniature components under a 5 10 power microscope. 3 Interwrap .003 Palco wire 53 and wrap wire 51 acts as heat sink to keep tungsten wire 4 to under 22500F. give good spatial distribution of braze to ensure good joint. 4 Control discharge current to better than 5 . 5 Control time of discharge to better than 5 . 6 De gas surfaces and then immerse in argon environment. 7 Used optimum cathode diameter. EXAMPLE 4 Weld to Very Small Diameter Wires 71 Encased in a Sheath 73 Using a Jig 75 Figs. 9 13 .A Objective Join together the two .003 Nichrome wires 71 at one end of a 60 length of sheathed cable 77. Sheath 73 O.D. is .019 and wires 71 embedded in mangesia 79.B Constraints 1 Must maintain insulation resistance between sheath 73 and a joint 81 of over 100 Megohms. 2 The joint 81 must carry current of over 0.2 amps at temperature of over 18000F for period of over 100 hours. 3 Joint 81 must survive over 200 temperature cycles between 18000F and 1O00F. 4 Operating temperature near melting point of nichrome, hence must weld, rather than braze, wires 71 together.C Prior Art Alternate Approach to Mini Arc that was tried Parts sent out to shop experienced in making such joints in sheathed thermocouples. Vendor would attempt to make weld joints. Of the 10 joints required, 2 were made after many tried. The remainder of sheath material was returned to us after 8 weeks and labelled defective. This is typical of this type weld requirement in the industry.D Application of the Micro Arc 1 The site of the joint 81 was positioned in jig 75 surrounded by a vortex generator housing 83. An argon enveloping gas 95 argon 5 hydro gen was injected through a nozzle 85 into the housing 83, with the gas escaping through a cathode opening 87. The resulting vortex surrounded the end of the wires 71 and a cathode 89. A microscope 91 permitted accurate position ing of the cable 77 and the cathode 89 in the jig 75. 2 A technique was developed to the point where it has a 90 success rate with one or two attempts. This 90 success was demonstrated in tens of samples. The procedure is automated, requiring no special extensive skills or expensive equipment.

Lug 101 with the insulated wire 103 are mounted on anode mount 113, with a cathode 115 mounted at the side of the lug 101. A high temperature braze material 117 was jammed into the end of the wire 103, between strands 119 of the wire 103. Because of the localized heating, the braze material 117 could simply be one of the strands 119 which extends away from the other strands, with all strands 119 being of the same material. 2 A technique was developed to the point where it has a nearly 100 success rate with first fusion attempt after hundreds of welds. The procedure is automated, requring no special skills or expensive equipment. A technician must have experience working with miniature components under 5 10 power microscope. 3 Developed electromagnetic method of cleaning surfaces using hi frequency discharge in atmos pheric pressure argon. 4 Developed unique method of supporting braze material in center of copper strands. 5 Adapted arc technique to work successfully with low temperature gold tin eutectic braze.
