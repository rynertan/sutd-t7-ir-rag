# Radiation sensitive record disc with improved internal structure.

## Abstract
A radiation sensitive record disc is disclosed having a first disc and a second disc coaxially positioned adjacent the first disc to reinforce the first disc. A first spacer is positioned be tween the first and second discs for fixedly connecting the discs together and to form an air space between the discs. A recording layer is formed on one surface of the first or second discs within the air space. A second spacer is radially displaced from the first spacer, and positioned between the first and sec ond discs. This second spacer enables the discs to move rela tive to each other in a radial direction in response to expansion or contraction of at least one of the discs due to changes in tem perature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.
