# A method in the production of hydrogen peroxide.

## Abstract
A method in the production of hydrogen peroxide by tlie anthraquinone process is described, in which method anthraquinone derivatives dissolved in a working solution are subjected alternatingly to hydrogenation aid oxida tion. To reduce the relative moisture in the working solu tion to a suitable level of 20 98 , preferably 40 85 , the working solution is dried prior to hydrogenation by con tacting it witli a gas or a gaseous mixture, the water vapor pressure of which is below that of the working solution. Suitable gases or gas mixtures are air or exhaust gases from the oxidation stage of the anthraquinone process.
