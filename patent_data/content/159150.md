# Magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate supports.

## Abstract
Composition comprising a transition metal component and magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate. Composition can be prepared by reacting suspension of magnesium alcoholate with carbon dioxide to form a magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate and reacting magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate with transition metal component. When the suspending liquid comprises an alcohol, the magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate dissolves and is subsequently precipitated with an antisolvent comprising metal alkyl or transition metal halide. When the suspending liquid is substantially free of alcohol, the magnesium hydrocarbyl carbonate suspension is reacted with metal alkyl and transition metal compound.
