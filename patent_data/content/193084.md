# Magnetic recording medium, a process for preparing a magnetic recording medium and a binder composition therefor.

## Abstract
A novel magnetic recording medium consisting of a base material, magnetic particles and a specific polyurethane based binder containing incorporated sul phonate groups, a process for preparing such a magnetic recording medium which comprises coating a base material with a coating material comprising i an organic solvent, ii a polyurethane binder containing chemically incorporated sulphonate groups and iii magnetic particles and the most preferred binder composition therefor comprising a hexan diol 1,6 polycarbonate based polyurethane.
