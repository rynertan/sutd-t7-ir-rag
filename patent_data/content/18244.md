# Automatic machining apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic machining apparatus includes means of sensing 1 or measuring displacements of a work model W , manual operation means 30 for manually operating the sens ing means 1 , a displacement determining device 58 for measuring the pressure difference responsive to the dis placement measured by the sensing means 1 , means for conversion of the pressure difference into electric signals and transmission of the signals, means for memorizing the signals transmitted from the signal transmitting means and storing the information in response to the transmitted sig nals, including means for computing the positional difference or disagreement between the sensing means 1 and the work model W , means for displacing machining means 45 for machining a work piece in accordance with the necessary information provided from the memory stored in the memo rizing means, means for slidably, rotatably or withdrawably mounting 35 the sensing means 1 nearby the machining means 45 , means for holding the work model W or work piece, means of controlling the holding means, means for ma chining the work piece including a variable machine tool, and feed means for permitting the machining means to machine the work piece in conformity with the information stored in the memory means in such a way that the sensing means 1 followed the work model W by the operation of the opera tion means.
