# DUAL COLLOID CATALYST COMPOSITIONS AND A METHOD FOR PREPARING THEM

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are catalyst compositions and preparation, which catalyst compositions are comprised of a from about 15 to about 85 wt. of crystallites select ed from the group consisting of i crystallites of one or more transition metals and ii crystallites of reducible transition metal carbides and nitrides, and mixtures thereof, said tran sition metal being selected from those reducible metals from Groups IB, IIB, VIB, VIIB, and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, wherein at least 80 of the crystallites have a diameter, d, between about 25 et 500 Å with the proviso that the crystallite size distribution of at least about 80 of these be expressed by the relationship 0.5D d 2D where D is the median of the diameters of this 80 . b from about 15 to about 85 wt. of a nonreducible promoter phase interdispersed with the metal crystallites and containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of Cr, Al, Si, Th, U and lanthanides, and Group IA, IIA, IIIB, IVB, and VB of the Periodic Table of the Elements, wherein the promoter phase is comprised of particles of which at least about 80 have a diameter between about 15 and 1500 Å wherein the median diameter D of the metal crystallites and the median diameter of the 80 of the pro moter particles do not differ by more than a factor of 20.
