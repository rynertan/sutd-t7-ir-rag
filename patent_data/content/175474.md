## Description
POLYURETHANE ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to polyurethane adhesive compositions and. in particular, to solvent free and water free polyurethane adhesive compositions which are useful as High Tack Adhesives i.e. adhesives which allow the substrates to which they are applied to be self supporting whilst the adhesive bond is formed. Traditionally, adhesives can be classified as follows a solvent or water based polymer solutions which upon evaporation of the solvent or water produce a substance which will adhere two substrates together by i further reaction to produce the adhesive bond whilst the substrates are held together, ii the cohesive strength of the adhesive towards the substrates which holds them together whilst further polymerization takes place to achieve the final bonded substrates. or iii a build up of the adhesive bond by crystallization of the adhesive whilst the substrates are held together. b a hot melt polymer which upon melting will co hesively adhere to a substrate upon application and upon contact the second substrate will achieve a thermoplastic bond between the two substrates upon cooling. c a one or two component composition which is applied to a substrate and then brought into contact with a second substrate and the said substrates held together whilst reaction occurs to make the final adhesive bond. In general therefore, adhesive compositions normally require that the bonded components be held together by an external force until a sufficient bond is produced to hold the substrates together.Hitherto, any compositions which allow the substrates to be self supporting whilst the bond is formed, i.e., contact adhesives or high tack adhesives, have been solvent or water based polymer solutions. or have involved the use of heating in their application, this latter technique requiring a finite time for the high tack surface to be produced. We have now developed a novel adhesive composition which is both solvent and water free.which has a low viscosity at room temperature. which is rapidly activated by daylight or an ultra violet light source to yield a high tack surface which will then adhere the two substrate surfaces together without external support and which can be cured at room temperature to create a thermoset bond which is resistant to heat, chemicals and oxygen. Accordingly, the present invention provides a solvent free and water free adhesive composition which comprises a polyurethane composition containing at least 1 by weight of terminal isocyanate groups and or terminal epoxide groups which is the co reaction product of i a polyhydroxy compound having a molecular weight in the range of from 100 to 6500 ii a polyisocyanate or a mixture of a polyisocyanate and an epoxide group containing compound and iii a hydroxy acrylate. a hydroxy methacrylate, a hydroxy allylic compound or a hydroxy vinyl compound the composition upon exposure to ultravoilet irradiation having a tack strength of a least 2N Cm2. The tack strength is a measure of the force which is necessary to separate two substrates which are joined by the adhesive composition in its activated state. The adhesive may be applied to one or both surfaces. The compositions after exposure to ultra violet irradiation having a tack strength of at least 2N CMê, preferably at least 3N CMê and more preferably at least 4N CM2. Component i , the polyhydroxy compound, may be a polyester, polyamide, polyester or polybutadiene polyol containing from 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups per molecule and having a molecular weight in the range of from 100 to 6500. The polyols for use in the invention may also contain unsaturation in order to aid the achievement of high tack on application to a substrate surface. The concentration of the polyhydroxy compound will generally be in the range of from 5 to 85 by weight of the reaction mixture. Component ii may comprise only a polyisocyanate which is an aliphatic or aromatic isocyanate containing from 2 to 4 isocyanate groups per molecule. Examples of the polyisocyanate are toluene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The polyisocyanate is preferably included in the reaction mixture in an amount of from 10 to 50 by weight and in an amount such that the adhesive composition contains at least 15 by weight, preferably at least 1.5 by weight of free isocyanate groups. Component ii may also include an epoxide group containing compound containing from 1 to 4 epoxide rings per molecule, in admixture with the isocyanate. The compound must also be capable of reacting into the polymer leaving pendant epoxy groups. An example of such an epoxide has the following structureEMI4.1 where R is CH2, C2H4, CnH2n where n is 3 to 10. The epoxide group containing compound, if present, is preferably included in the reaction mixture in an amount of from 1 20 by weight. Component iii may be hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxybutyl methacrylate, 4 hydroxycyclohexyl acrylate, 4 hydroxycyclohexyl methacrylate, 5 hydroxycyclooctyl acrylate or 5 hydroxycyclooctyl methacrylate. Other hydroxy derivatives of acrylic or methacylic acid esters and hydroxy allylic compounds or hydroxy vinyl compounds may also be used. Component iii is generally used in an amount of from 5 to 40 by weight. The reaction mixture used in the preparation of the polyurethane composition contained in the adhesive compositions of the present invention may also include an unsaturated co reactant. The unsaturated co reactant may be, for example, an alkyc acrylate, an alkyl methacrylate, a polyfunctional acrylate or polyfunctional methacrylate resin. The co reactant will generally be included in the reaction mixture in an amount of from 0 to 80 by weight. To facilitate cure of the high tack adhesive, the mixture may also contain a compound which is rendered isocyanate reactive upon application of the adhesive to one of the substrates and activation by atmospheric moisture. Examples of such compounds include oxazolidines, ketimines and enamines. These latent isocyanate reactants may be included to cure the adhesive more rapidly than relying on the basic isocyanate water reaction. The reaction mixture may also include therein one or more catalysts of the following type a a photoinitiator to initiate the free radical polymerisation of the unsaturated groups when exposed to ultra violet radiation. Such a photo initiator may be present in an amount of from 0 to 10 by weight. b a photoinitiator which generates cations which initiate the polymerization of any free epoxide groups contained in the composition c a moisture curing catalyst to accelerate the reaction of the isocyanate groups with atmospheric moisture or the latent isocyanate reactant. and d a photoactivator which may be used in combination with a photoinitiator as discussed above to produce a synergistic effect with regard to the polymerisation rate. Other additives may be used in order to improve the performance of the adhesive. Such additives may be antioxidants, pigments and rheology modifiers, such as wetting, thixotropic and flatting agents. The adhesive compositions of the present invention contain unsaturated groups which polymerise when activated by radiation such as ultra violet radiation, if desired catalysed by a photoinitiator.When the adhesive compositions of the present invention are applied to a substrate surface and thereafter exposed to radiation, a high tack is developed and the first substrate surface may then be contacted with a second substrate surface to produce a fixed laminate. Cure may also be assisted by the cationic polymerization of free epoxide groups if these are present in the composition, this polymerization proceeding both during and after the free radical polymerization of any free isocyanate groups present in the composition. Ultimate cure of the adhesive composition is obtained by the reaction of atmospheric moisture or any latent isocyanate reactant, if included, with the terminal isocyanate groups in the polyurethane compositons to produce urea groups. The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples in which parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.TACK STRENGTH In these Examples. the tack strength was measured using a Blocking Tester Rohm Haas which conformed to DIN ISO 4622 and ASTM 2793. The method involved the separation of two plane adhering layers by a force. which acts in a vertical direction related to the tangent plane. The result from such a test is termed the tack strength. or blocking resistance. The adhesive was applied to a glass rectangular slide 76 x 25mm . It was exposed to a W source.Immediately it was contacted with a similar slide placed at right angles to the first in a jig which provided accurate alignment. A load was applied for 30 seconds. The crossed composite was placed in the machine and the separating force applied at a constaDe rate. Upon yield, the increase in force ceased and was used as a measure of force per area of adhesion. All tests were carried out at 23 2 C. U.V. CURING The formulations of the Examples were cured using a proprietary U.V. curing source PrimarcMini cure. This laboratory equipment is very representative of industrial scale U.V. curing sources.. The lamp emitted U.V. radiation at an energy of 200 watts per inch and the wavelength of emission of a mercury lamp. Exposure times of 1 2 1 second were used in each case to achieve the desired degree of polymerisation.

They were coated at 60 solids in methylene chloride. A tack strength value of greater than 2 3N cm2, as measured on the Rohm Haas Blocking Tester, is regarded as satisfactory in sticking together most common substrates EG. paper, wood, fabrics, plastics, natural and synthetic polymers, foams, ceramics, metals. glass. minerals and concrete. In use of the adhesive compositions of the present invention, the one component material is applied to one substrate surface by spraying. dipping or coating. The wet coating of adhesive is exposed to an electron beam, daylight or an ultra violet lamp.The coating changes to a high tack polymerisate which bonds and coheres very readily to a second substrate surface to produce an instant high green strength bonded laminate. At this stage, the bond is still partially fluid and subsequent reaction with atmospheric moisture and or any latent isocyanate reactant present and or a cationically initiated epoxide reaction is necessary to produce a crosslinked polymer which is completely cured.
