# Polymer composition, production and use.

## Abstract
A polymer composite is produced by polymerising an olefine monomer in the presence of a catalyst system obtained by treating a filler material with a an organic magnesium compound which contains halogen or b an organic magnesium compound and thereafter with a halogen containing compound and then with a transition metal compound, which is preferably titanium tetrachloride, adding an organic metal activator compound and continuing the polymerisation to obtain a composite containing desired proportions of polymer and filler. The filler may be carbon, an alumino silicate such as mica or talc, or glass fibre. Homogeneous composites, in respect of the distribution of filler in various size fractions, can be obtained. Composites having good flow characteristics may be obtained. The composites may be formed directly into shaped articles by suitable shaping techniques. Alternatively, the composite may be blended with a polymeric material.
