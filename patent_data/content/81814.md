# Reciprocating compressor.

## Abstract
A reciprocating compressor 20 comprises a piston body 24 reciprocally movably disposed within a cylinder housing 21 and having first and second pistons 27, 28 which are coaxially aligned with each other. The first and second pistons 27, 28 define respectively first and second chambers 25, 26 within the cylinder housing 21 . Intake and discharge valves 30, 31 are provided to allow therethrough a fluid to be sucked into and to be discharged out of each cylinder chamber 25, 26 , respectively. Additionally, the compressor 20 is provided with a device 32, 33 for changing the rotary motion of a drive shaft 34 into the reciprocating motion of the piston body 24 . Accordingly, the compressor 20 becomes small sized and light in weight and is simplified in construction, thereby considerably reducing parts thereof.
