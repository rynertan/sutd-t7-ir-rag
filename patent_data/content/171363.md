# Microleaks intercepting apparatus for avoiding and or signalling oil leakages in hydraulic plants and for equivalent uses.

## Abstract
A unidirectional valve 7 has channel which extends in the direction of the obturator 23 movement, which channel is to be passed through by possible microleaks in case of losses in the actuator branch 3 a considerable run of the obturator 23 in the presence of microleaks and of conse quent pressure losses is thus obtained a sensor 47 detects the obturator displacements.
