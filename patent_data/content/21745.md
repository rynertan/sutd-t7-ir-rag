# An automatic temperature control system for a vehicle passenger compartment.

## Abstract
Ambient or recirculated air is passed through a housing containing an evaporator core 20 and a heating core 22 by means of a blower 18 . The control system comprises an automatic temperature control sensor 32 which provides a modulated vacuum control signal for a vacuum motor 40 which has an output which adjusts a biasing element in a pressure operated electrical switch 30 , resulting in on off duty cycling of an electrically energizable clutch 28 which transmits power from the vehicle engine to the cooling unit compressor 26 . The percentage of time that the compressor is on versus the time off is a function of the control signal which is in turn a function of the ambient, in car, and manually selected set point temperatures sensed by the sensor 32 . At ambient temperatures below a predetermined minimum the control signal shuts off the compressor and places the system in a heating mode by deflecting air onto the heater core 22 via a blend door 62 operated by a vacuum motor 38 under the control of the sensor 32 . The system prevents needless cooling of ambient air prior to heating, thus saving power. During the cooling mode, the cooling unit is energized only as needed to maintain the passenger compartment at the setpoint temperature, thus minimizing power usage. Vacuum motor 68 operates in response to engine acceleration to cut out the compressor and thereby improve vehicle performance.
