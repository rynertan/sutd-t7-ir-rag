# Acylacetanilide compounds and their use as yellow forming colour couplers for silver halide photography.

## Abstract
Novel colour forming couplers for use in silver halide colour photography are described. These couplers upon oxidative coupling with an aromatic primary amino colour developing agent produce dyes of improved stability against light and dyes having favourable spectral absorption characteristics. The couplers have high coupling activity and thus produce high colour densities. The novel couplers are acylacetanilide compounds whereof the phenyl nucleus of the anilide group carries oxyhydrocarbon groups, preferably alkoxy groups in the 2 ,4 and 5 position with respect to the amido group.
