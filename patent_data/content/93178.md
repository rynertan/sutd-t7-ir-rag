# PRODUCTION OF SUPERPLASTIC ALUMINUM ALLOY STRIPS.

## Abstract
A superplastic aluminum alloy plate containing 1.5 to 9.0 magnesium, 0.5 to 5.0 silicon, 0.05 to 1.2 man ganese, 0.05 to 0.3 chromium, and the balance substantial ly consisting of aluminum, and a process for producing a superplastic aluminum alloy plate, which comprises con tinuously cast rolling a molten aluminum alloy containing 1.5 to 9.0 magnesium, 0.5 to 5.0 silicon, 0.05 to 1.2 manganese, and 0.05 to 0.3 chromium to form a 3 to 20 mm thick strip, subjecting it to homogenizing processing at 430 to 550 C, and cold rolling it to a rolling ratio of 60 or above.
