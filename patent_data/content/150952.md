# Photopolymerizable composition.

## Abstract
A photopolymerizable composition is composed of a poly merizable monomer and an initiator capable of polymerizing said monomer upon exposure to visible light. The initiator con sists essentially of a at least one photosensitizer selected from an Î± diketone, quinone, and their derivatives, b at least one accelerator selected from aldehyde containing no amino groups and its derivatives, and possibly c an organic perox ide. A filler may be included in the composition, especially if it is for dental use.
