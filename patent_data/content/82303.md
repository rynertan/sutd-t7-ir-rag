# Method and apparatus for controlling induction motor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for operating an induction motor by an inverter of the pulse width modulation PWM type, wherein the slip frequency is calculated from the speed command and the actual motor speed so as to produce the phase compensation signal, and the frequency command for the inverter 22 is produced by adding the phase compensation signal, the slip frequency signal and the motor speed signal. The primary current command is calculated from the slip frequency, the amplitude ratio of pulse width modulation is calculated basing on the primary current command and the actual primary current, and the inverter 22 is controlled in accordance with the amplitude ratio so as to control the primary current of the induction motor 23 .
