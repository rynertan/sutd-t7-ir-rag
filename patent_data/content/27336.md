# Passive clincher and stapler incorporating same.

## Abstract
A passive clincher and a stapler incorporating same are described. The clincher has an anvil 30 to which staples are applied during a driving operation of the stapler. The anvil 30 is formed with a depression or opening 35 between the clinching grooves 31 and is of size to include the adjacent ends of the grooves. The depression or opening 35 assists in controlling the bending of the legs of the staple during a stapling operation to prevent re entry or re penetration of the legs into a set of sheets being stapled.
