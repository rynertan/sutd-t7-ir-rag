# Developing device.

## Abstract
A developing device comprising a developer carrier mem ber 33, 33₁ to form thereon a developing layer with carrier particles which attracts toner particles a toner holding mem ber 34 which traverses past the developer carrier member and faces the developer layer so that toner particles are received to form a toner layer on the toner holding member 34 , which then passes a developing station a DC voltage source E₂ for applying a DC voltage between the developer bearing member 33, 33₁ and toner holding member 34 so as to separate toner particles only from the developer held on the developer bearing member and absorb it onto the toner holding member 34 and an elastic blade 40, 49 which makes sliding contact with the toner particles held on the toner holding member 34 .
