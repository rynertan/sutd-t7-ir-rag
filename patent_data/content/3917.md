# A method of and apparatus for determining the capacity of a storage battery.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for determining the capacity of lead acid storage batteries are disclosed. The battery s initial open circuit voltage is stored in a settable memory 42 . Thereafter, the open circuit voltage values of the battery throughout the discharge period are determined by measuring loaded voltages with reference to the stored open circuit voltages to detect the discharge rates. The rates of discharge are used to reset the stored value of the initial open circuit voltage measurement thereby producing a moving reference. The memory output value is a function of the capacity of the battery. During the charge period, the charge voltages are measured with reference to the stored open circuit voltages to detect the charge rates. The rates of charge are used to reset the stored value of an initial open circuit voltage measurement. Again, the memory output value is a function of the capacity of the battery.
