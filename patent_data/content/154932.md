# MULTILAYER PHOTORESIST PROCESS

## Abstract
A photoetch process of the portable conformable mask type is disclosed wherein a thin top layer 5 of resist and a thick planarizing layer 3 of resist are deposited on a sub strate 1 and the thin layer 5 is exposed to light and develop ed to produce a portable conformable mask. A first dye is dissolved in the bottom layer 3 to absorb light of the wave lengths used to expose the top layer 5 in order to prevent in terference with exposure of the top layer 5 by light reflected from the substrate 1. The bottom resist layer 3 absorbs rela tively strongly in a wavelength region in which the light source used to expose the bottom resist 3 is relatively in tense. A second dye is added to the top layer 5 to make that layer opaque to light of the wavelengths used to expose the bottom layer 3 so that the top layer 5 can serve as a mask for the bottom layer 3. The particular dyes chosen must not in terfere with the processing of either resist layer.
