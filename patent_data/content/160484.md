# FM RECEIVER INCLUDING A BASEBAND PLL CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An FM receiver comprises a complex detector for complex detecting an FM signal by using, as a reference signal, a local oscillator signal having a frequency substan tially equal to the carrier frequency of the FM signal a first low pass filter for filtering out the real part of the complex output signal from the complex detector a second low pass filter for filtering out the imaginary part of the complex signal a complex voltage controlled oscillator operating in the positive and negative frequency ranges including the zero frequency and being frequency controllable with a frequency control signal an operational circuit for taking out one of the imagery and the real part signals of the product of the output complex conlugate signal from the complex voltage contolled oscillator and the filtered complex signals from the first and second low pass filters and a third low pass filter for filtering the output of the operational circuit to provide a demodulated output and to feed the same back as the frequency control signal to the complex voltage controlled oscillator.
