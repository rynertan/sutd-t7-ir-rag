# High speed CPU sequencer for video games.

## Abstract
A high speed CPU sequencer for use in a video game provides multi channel binary output for display control purposes. The CPU sequencer includes a macro section 16 that is user programmable with macro instructions and a micro section 18 that is user programmable with micro instructions. The CPU sequencer is responsive to display information provided by a game microprocessor during a brief handshake period and carries out display computations independently of the game microprocessor, at higher speed, and using larger binary data words.
