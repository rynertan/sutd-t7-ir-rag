# Latently curable organosilicone release coating composition.

## Abstract
A latently curable, organosilicone composition compris es a metal catalyzed organosilicone composition capable of undergoing hydrosilation and, as hydrosilation inhibitor, an organic monohydrogen derivative of an unsaturated alipha tic 1,4 dicarboxylic acid, i.e., maleic acid or acetylene dicar boxylic acid. The organic monohydrogen derivatives of use in this invention effectively inhibit catalyzed hydrosilation reactions at low or room temperature while allowing efficient hydrosilation reaction rates to occur at elevated tempera tures. These monohydrogen derivatives perform their inhibi tive function effectively at low concentration. The latently curable composition may be coated on a substrate to provide release surface for an adjacent adhesive layer.
