A typical Butyl Rubber which is useful isExxon Butyl 365 Exxon Chemical Co. , having a mole percent unsaturation of 2.0 and a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2120F of 40 50. Low molecular weight Butyl rubbers, i.e.,Butyl rubbers having a viscosity average molecular weight of 5,000 to 85,000 and a mole percent unsaturation of from 1 to 5 may be sulfonated to produce the polymers useful in this invention. Preferably, these polymers have a viscosity average molecular weight of 25,000 to 60,000. The EPDI5 terpolymers of the present invention are low unsaturated polymers having 1 to 10.0 wt. olefinic unsattration, more preferably 2 to 8, most pref erably 3 to 7 defined according to the definition as found in ASTM D 1418 64 and is intended to mean terpolymers containing ethylene and propylene in the backbone and a diene in the side chain. Illustrative methods for producing these terpolymers are found in U S. Patent 3,280,082, British Patent 1,030,289 and French Patent 1,386,600. The preferred polymers contain 40 to 80 wt. ethylene and 1 to 10 wt. VZc of a diene monomer, the balance of the polymer being propylene.Preferably, the polymer contains 50 to 70 wt. ethylene, e.g. 50 wt. and 2.6 to 8.0 wt. diene monomer, e.g. 5.0 wt. .

TheMooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of the EPDM terpolymer is 5 to 60, more preferably 10 to 50, most preferably 15 to 40. The thermoplastic resins of the present invention are polystyrene thermoplastic resins which are selected from ijRf polystyrene, polyvinyltoluene, poly t butyl styrene, polychlorostyrene, poly alpha methyl styrene or co or terpolymers of the aforementioned monomers with themselves or with acrylonitrile. The polystyrene resins suitable for use in the practice of this invention have a weight average molecular weight of 5,000 to 500,000 more preferably 20,000 to 350,000 and most preferably 90,000 to 300,000. These base polystyrene thermoplastic resins can be prepared directly by any of the known polymerization processes.The term thermoplastic is used in its conventional sense to mean a substantially rigid flexus modulus 10,000 psi material capable of retaining the ability to flow at elevated temperatures for relatively long times. The preferred polystyrene thermoplastic resin is a homopolymer of styrene having a number average molecular weight of 180,000, and an intrinsic viscosity in toluene of 0.8. These polymers are widely available commercially in large volume. A suitable polystyrene resin is Styron 666 Dow Chemical which affords a suitable molecular weight. This invention involves the preparation of powders of ionic containing polymers. The ion containing polymer preferably a sulfonate containing polymer, is dissolved in an organic solvent, which is largely immiscible with water, or in a mixture of such organic solvent and a polar cosolvent, such as an alcohol or an amine, which is largely miscible with water. The major solvent in the binary solvent mixture is preferably the water immiscible organic solvent. The minor component polar cosolvent functions to dissociate the ionic associations and thereby promote solution of the ion containing polymer. Most systems employ the binary solvent. Single solvent systems require low ionic group content and are limited to the least ionic cations. The cements of the ion containing polymers can be prepared from preformed and isolated polymers through re solution. Preferably the cements are those which exist at the end of the manufacturing process, prior to dry polymer isolation. When cements of ion containing polymers are contected with water a marked increase in cement viscosity or the formation of a gel occurs. When the cement is composed of a single organic solvent, viscosity increases or gelation occurs through the interaction of water with the ionic groups thereby resulting in an increased degree of association of the ion containing polymer chains. When the cement is composed of a binary solvent the water also serves to remove the solubilizing polar cosolvent. Thus in the process of this invention the water is not simply serving as a dispersion medium but exercises a vitally important function in the formation of powders. When the cements of ion containing polymers are contacted with water under high shear very small particles of cement dispersed in water are formed. The polar cosolvent, if present, is rapidly extracted into the water phase, and water rapidly diffuses into the organic phase to effect marked viscosity increases in the cement particle or a gelation of the particle. When essentially gelled the particle can be considered a crosslinked polymer swollen by solvent. If the crosslinking is high then the cement viscosity is very high and gel strength very high. Under these conditions the swollen particle is extremely stable and will not agglomerate with other such particles. Particle stability is not the result of emulsifiers of other such stabilizing compounds but is due simply to the high viscosity or high gel strength of the cement. Once such dispersions are prepared they are very stable and can be stored for long periods without substantial agglomeration. In addition, because of the high gel strength of the swollen particle not only is agglomeration of the particles substantially prevented but also adhesion of the particles to surfaces is prevented. Thus, one significant advantage of this process is that little if any fouling occurs either during the preparation of the dispersion or during the solvent stripping operation with hot water. The stripping of the solvent from the swollen particle is promoted by the small size of the particle. Solvent stripping is not only very rapid but also very efficient. In addition, when the solvent is stripped the particle remains very porous since the gel network remains during and after solvent removal and the solvent is thereby replaced by empty space. The wet powders are more readily dried because of their high surface areas in equipment such as tunnel dryers, fluid bed dryers, tray dryers, vacuum dryers, and the like. This overall process permits the isolation and drying of ion containing polymers which are unable to be melt processed, i.e. which possess melt viscosities so high that they cannot be extruded. Since many ion containing polymers are useful in solution applications the process of this invention permits the isolation of clean, dry polymers which cannot be produced any other way. The powders prepared according to the process of this invention possess many advantages over polymers which are muchlargerin size and which are not porous. In thermoplastic applications the polymer is formulated with a wide variety of fillers, extenders, and other additives in order to reduce material cost while improving the properties of the composition. Normally this sort of mixing is conducted with high shear energy intensive mixers. While this is indeed possible with the powders of this invention it is preferred that the powders be dry mixed with the various ingredients to obtain a well dispersed, homogeneous blend which requires little additional mixing on fluxing. The dry mixes can be charged directly to injection molders where the fluxing and little additional mixing provides for a uniform and well dispersed article.These dry mixes also permit the formulation of ion containing polymers which possess such high melt viscosities that the mixing of such polymers with large particle sizes results in poor dispersion, poor rheological properties, and poor properties of the final article. The small size and porous nature of the powders produced according to the present process also allows for very rapid solution of the ion containing polymers either in single solvent or binary solvent systems. Rapid solution is not only very desirable but absolutely necessary in some applications for economical operation in respect to both.time and energy saving. The elastomeric or thermoplastic polymer is dissolved in a non reactive solvent such as a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane, pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane, or heptane. The cement of the elastomeric or thermoplastic polymer is contacted with a sulfonating agent in a reaction zone at a temperature of 100C to 1000C for a period of time of 1 minute to 120 minutes, most preferably for 5 to 90 minutes and most preferably for 15 to 60. Typical sulfonating agents are described inU.S. Patents 3,642,728 and 3,836,511.These sulfonating agents are selected from an acyl sulfate, a mixture of sulfuric acid and an acid anhydride or a complex of a sulfur trioxide donor and a Lewis base containing oxygen, sulfur or phosphorous. Typical sulfur trioxide donors are SO3, chlorosulfonic acid, fluorosulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, oleum, etc. Typical Lewis bases are dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, or triethylphosphate.The most preferred sulfonation agent for this invention is an acyl sulfate selected from the group consisting essentially of benzoyl, acetyl, propionyl or butyryl sulfate.The acyl sulfate can be formed in situ in the reaction medium or pregenerated before its addition to the reaction medium in chlorinated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon. It should be pointed out that neither the sulfonating agent nor the manner of sulfonation is critical in producing the unneutralized sulfonate derivative provided that the sulfonating method does not degrade the polymer backbone. The unneutralized sulfonated polymer has 5 to 250 meq.sulfonate groups per 100 grams of sulfonated polymer, more preferably 7 to 200, and most preferably 10 to 175.The meq. of sulfonate groups 100 grams of polymer is determined by both titration of the polymeric sulfonate and Dietert Sulfur Analysis. In the titration of the sulfonated polymer, the polymer is dissolved in suitable solvent at a concentration level of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The dissolved sulfonated polymer is titrated with ethanols6 scdium hydroxide to an ,Alizarin Thymolphtria lein endpoint. The unneutralized sulfonated polymer is gel free and hydrolytically stable. Gel is measured by stirring a given weight of polymer in a solvent at a concentration of 5 wt. for 24 hours, allowing the mixture to settle, withdrawing a weighed sample of the supernatant solution and evaporating to dryness. Hydrolytically stable means that the acid function, in this case the unneutralized sulfonated polymer, will not be eliminated under neutral or slightly basic conditions to a neutral moiety which is incapable of being converted to highly ionic functionality. The unneutralized sulphonated polymer is neutralised by the addition of a solution of a basic salt or an amine to the unneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer dissolved in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents. The amine can be a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine as well as a tetralkyl ammonium hydroxide wherein the substituents contain from I to 50 carbon atoms. The basic salt is dissolved in a binary solvent system consisting of water and or an aliphatic alcohol. The monovalent counferions cations of these basic salts are selected from ammonium, lithium, sodium, potassium and cessium and mixtures thereof. The anion of the basic salt is selected from a carboxylic acid having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms a hydroxide or alkoxide having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof. The preferred neutralizing agent is a metal hydroxide, more preferably sodium hydroxide. Sufficient base is added to the solution of the unneutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer to effect neutralization. It is preferable to neutralize at least 95 of the sulfonate groups, more preferably 98 , most preferably 100 . The di or trivalent or multivalent counter ions cations of the basic salts are selected from the group consisting of antimony, aluminum, lead or Groups II A,I B, II B of the Periodic Table of Elements and mixtures thereof. The anion of the basic salt is selected from a carboxylic acid having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxide or alkoxide having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof. The preferred. neutralizing agent is a metal acetate. The metal or ammonium sulfonate containing polymers at the higher sulfonate levels possess extremely high melt viscosities and are thereby difficult to melt process.The addition of ionic group plasticizers markedly reduces melt viscosity and frequently enhances physical properties. To the solution of the neutralized sulfonated polymer can be added a preferential plasticizer selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid having 5 to 30 carbon atoms, more preferably 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and the zinc and lead salts of these carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acids are selected from the group consisting of lauric, myristic, palmitic, or stearic acids and mixtures thereof e.g. zinc stearate, lead stearate, or zinc laurate. The preferential plasticizer is incorporated into the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer at less than 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, more preferably at 8 to 40, and most preferably at 10 to 25. The metallic salt of the carboxylic acid can also be used as neutralizing agent. In the case of the neutralizing agent and plasticizer being the identical chemical species, additional metallic salt is added over the required levels of neutralization. Alternatively, other preferential plasticizers are selected from amines, carbonates, amides, such as stearamide, and ammonium and amine salts of carboxylic acids and mixtures thereof. The preferred plasticizers are selected from carboxylic acids having 5 to 30 carbon atoms or metallic salts of the carboxylic acid and mixtures thereof. To the neutralized sulfonated polymer in the cement can be added a non polar backbone process oil. The oils employed in the present invention are non polar process oils having less than 2 wt. polar type compounds as measured by molecular type clay gel analysis. These oils are selected from paraffinics ASTM Type 104B as defined inASTM D 2226 70, aroma tics ASTM Type 102 or napthenics ASTMType 104A, wherein the oil has a flash point by the Cleveland open cup of at least 3500F, a pour point of less than 40OF, a viscosity of 70 to 3000 ssu s at 100OF and a number average molecular weight of 300 to 1000, and more preferably 300 to 750. The preferred process oils are paraffinics. Table I illustrates typical oils encompassed by the scope of this invention.The oils are incorporated into the blend composition at a concentration level of 20 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, more preferably at 20 to 175, and most preferably at 25 to 150.

To the cement of the sulfonated polymer derivative is added an amine or a basic salt of a mpnovalent or multivalent cation as previously defined, thereby forming a cement of metal or ammonium neutralized sulfonated polymer. To the cement of the metal or ammonium neutralized sulfonated polymer can be added the preferential plasticizer or non polar process oil. To the cement of the metal or ammonium neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer is added water at volume ratio of water to cement of 60 1 to 2 1, more preferably 20 1 to 2 1 and most preferably 4 1 to 2 1.The blend of water and cement is then subject to high shear emulsification to form a slurry of cement particles containing the ionic polymer in water. The ability of cements to function in this invention is dependent upon the viscosity of the cement particle after contacting with water. The cement particle may contain not only the ion containing polymer but also fillers, extender oils, and other additives. Thus it is difficult to define the basic parameters of the ion containing polymer with regard to the ultimate gel strength of the watercontacted particle. However, ion containing polymers which are useful in the practice of this invention are those which possess a melt viscosity at 2000C and at a shear rate of l 4 0.88 sec 1 of at least 10 poise, preferably at least 5x 104 poise, and most preferably at least 105 poise. Emulsification of the cement can be done batchwise using equipment such as a Waring Blunder, Gifford Wood laboratory mixer or a Barinco mixer. It can also be done continuously using commercially available emulsification equipment such as a Greerco hi shear pipeline mixer, anAkmar emulsion mill or a colloid mill. The continuous process for the formation of the cement slurry in water using equipment such as a 2 Greerco hi shear pipeline mixer is conducted with rotor speeds of 5000 RPM s to 10000 RPM s, more preferably 7500 to about 10000 and most preferably 8000 to 10000. Further fine particle sizes with narrow size distribution can be obtained by using theGreerco tandem shear head configuration and by increasing the residence time of the slurry under the high shear conditions.This can be done by recycling the slurry through the mixer at recycle rate of 1 to 1 to 10 to 1 which is substantially the same as reducing the slurry flow rate through the mixer by the same ratios. Fine uniform parti cles can also be obtained by processing the slurry through a series of mixers in line, that is, process the slurry through from 2 to 4 mixers in series. The mixers in this series configuration can also be operated with recycle in the range given above. The slurry is subjected to a solvent flashing operation such as in a batch steam stripper, thereby effecting removal of the solvent. The slurry particles of a fine powder of metal or ammonium neutralized sulfonated polymer can be further washed with water and subsequently filtered.The filtered particles of the fine powder of the metal or ammonium neutralized sulfonated polymer are mechanically dewatered in a device such as a two roll mill, a sludge press or a dewatering extruder to a water content of less than 20 wt. water, more preferably less than 15 wt. and most preferably less than 10 wt. . The particles are then hot air dried in a fluid bed dryer or flash dryers or tunnel dryers to a water content of less than 2 wt. of water, more preferably less than 1 wt. , and most preferably less than 0.5 wt. .The formed and dried powdered particles have a volume density of 15 to 30 lbs cu. foot, more preferably 18 to 25 and most preferably 20 to 25. The particle size distribution of the formed powder can be measured by sieve analysis wherein the weight retained on U.S. Sieve Number Screens is TABU II U.S. Sieve Screen Number Retained Powder wt.7. 10 20 about 60 to about 95 20 40 about 3 to about 36 40 60 about 0.5 to about 3.0 The formed powder can be readily dry blended with various chemical additives such as the previously mentioned preferential plasticizers or non polar process oils or with fillers, polyolefinic thermoplastics or waxes and mixtures thereof. The blend composition of the powder and additive can be compounded on a two roll mill or fed directly into an extruder in order to be extruded or in jection molded directly into a finished article. Other methods known in the art which are suitable for making these compositions include those methods employed in the plastic and elastomer industries for mixing polymer systems. An excellent polymer blend composition of this invention can be obtained through the use of a high shear batch intensive mixer called the Banbury. Alternatively, economic advantages in terms of time and labor savings can be obtained through the use of a Farrel Continuous Mixer, a twin screw extruder, or extrusion techniques which are continuous mixing type equipment. The Banbury mixing device is the preferred batch type mixer, and the twin screw extruder is the pre ferred continuous mixer. The fillers employed in the present invention are selected from carbon blacks, talcs, ground calcium carbonate, water precipitated calcium car bonate and delaminated, calcined and hydrated clays and mixtures thereof. These fillers are incorporated into the blend composition at 25 to 350 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, more pre ferably at 50 to 350 and most preferably at 50 to 300. Typically, these fillers have a particle size of 0.03 to 20 microns, more preferably 0.3 to 10, and most preferably 0.5 to 10. The oil absorption as measured by grams of oil absorbed by 100 grams of filler is 10 to 100, more preferably 10 to 85, and most preferably 10 to 75. Typical fillers employed in this invention are illustrated in table III.

The petroleum and synthetic waxes are most important for the present invention. Other than paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbon groups waxes can contain polar functional groups such as alcohols, ketones, and esters. It is preferred that the waxes used in this invention be predominantly non polar since polar functional groups function as plasticizers for the ionic sulfonate groups. Excessive plasticization is undesirable. The largest percentage of polar functional groups in waxes are those containing oxygen by virtue of hydrocarbon oxidation. For the purpose of this invention, a wax is considered to be non polar when it contains less than 4.0 wt. , more preferably less than 2.0 wt. oxygen. The waxes are incorporated into the blend composition at a concentration level of 2 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, more preferably 2 to 15, and most preferably 7 to 15. The waxes employed in the present invention have a softening point of 125OF to 2200F, more preferably 1350F to 2000F, and most preferably about 1500F to 2000F. The preferred waxes have an Mn of 300 to 4000. These waxes are typically crystalline wherein the percent crystallinity can vary depending on the composition of the wax and the Mn. A crystalline polyolefinic thermoplastic can be incorporated into the powder blend composition in minor proportions as a means for modification of the rheological properties of the blend compositions as well as the physical properties of the polymeric article. Typically, the crystalline polyolefinic thermoplastic is added to the blend composition at a concentration level of less than 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer, more preferably at less than 75 and most preferably at 5 to 50. The crystalline polyolefin is characterized as a polymer of an alpha olefin having a molecular weight of at least 2000, preferably at least 14000, and more preferably at least 24000. This material comprises substantially an olefin but may incorporate other monomers, for example, vinyl acetate, acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, sodium acrylate, etc. The preferred polyolefins are polymers of C2 toC4 alpha olefins. Most preferably, the polyolefins are polyethylene, polybutene, polypropylene or an ethylene propylene copolymer. It is critical that the crystalline polyolefin have a degree of crystallinity of at least 40X. Both high and low density polyethylene are within the scope of the present invention. For example, polyethylenes having a density from .90 to .97 gms cc are generally included. Polypropylene polymers having intermediate and high densities are the preferred examples of the polypropylene materials useful in the present invention. These materials will have a density from .88 to .925 gms cc. The polyethylene or polypropylene can also be combined as copolymers thereof so long as adequate crystallinity is obtained in said combination. Thus, block copolymers wherein polyethylene or polypropylene is present in crystalline form are effective. The advantages of both the rheological and physical properties of the blend compositions of the present invention can be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples and tables. Unless otherwise specified, all measurements are in parts per hundred by weight.Example 1 To a clean glass lined 50 gal. Pfaudler reactor was charged 23.9 gal. of n hexane. Twenty pounds of cubedVistalon 2504, a commercial EPDM containing 50 wt. ethylene and 5 wt. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and having a Mooney viscosity of 40 ML, 1 8, 212OF , was then charged to the reactor with agitation. The reactor was heated to and held at 700C. The solvent was refluxed through a vertical condenser equipped with a Dean Stark type trap to collect water that might be present. After solution had occurred the reactor was then cooled to 250C.To the cement was added 1.59 pounds of acetic anhydride.Then 0.69 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid was slowly added to the cement with good agitation. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min., then the sulfonated polymer was neutralized with a solution of 1.32 pounds of Zn OOCCH3 2 2H20 in 2.72 gallons of methanol and 0.14 gallons of water. Irganox 1010 0.028 pounds was charged to the neutralized cement and the mixture was agitated for 2 hours. The neutralized cement was then pumped from the reactor and mixed with hot water 88 950C in a nozzle assembly preceding a pipe line hi shear mixer. On passing through the pipe line hi shear mixer, the cement was dispersed as small, discrete particles into the water forming a slurry. This slurry was then fed directly into a batch steam stripper where the hexane removal was effected. The resulting wet polymer was in the form of a fine powder.The cement flow rate was 0.5 GPM and the water flow rate was 2.5 GPM. The wet powder was then removed from the stripper and dried in a Fitzpatrick FA 75 fluid bed dryer at an operating air temperature of 2000F. Drying to a final moisture content of less than 1 wt. H20 was effected in 1 1 2 hours from an initial moisture content of 65 wt. . Titration of a sample of unneutralized sulfonated polymer taken prior to neutralization in toluene methanol solution with ethanolic sodium hydroxide showed it to contain abort 31 meq. of sulfonate lOOg polymer.The sulfur and metal contents are given in Table IV along with the particle size distribution of the finished, dried powder. The stress strain properties of the neutralized gum were determined at both room temperature and 700C on microdumbbells with an Instron TM instrument at 2 inches minute. Melt viscosity was determined over a range of shear rates at 2000C with an Instron table model capillary rheometer. The stress strain and rheological properties of the gum are given in Table V. The finished powder remained as a free flowing powder when stored under a load of 2 psi for one month.

Titration of a sample of unneutralized sulfonated polymer in toluene methanol solution with ethanolic sodium hydroxide showed it to contain 31 meq. of sulfonate groups lOOg polymer. Elemental analysis and particle size distribution are given in Table IV. the powder had a narrow overall size distribution with almost 96 falling within the range of 10 20 mesh. Rheological and stressstrain properties of molded powder are given in Table V.Example 3 A series of three metal neutralized sulfonatedEPDM polymers were made directly into powders following the process described in Example 1.

To the cement was added 77.9 millimoles of acetic anhydride per lOOg EPDM and 33.3 millimoles of sulfuric acid per lOOg EPDM. The sulfonated polymer was then neutralized with 60 milliequivalents of zinc acetate per lOOg EPDM dissolved in a methanol water solution.The neutralized cement was stabilized by the addition of 0.1 gm of Irganox 1010 per lOOgm EpDM. Zinc neutralized sulfonated EPDM polymers were then finis hed as powders according to the process described in Example 1. The properties and compositions of these three materials are given in Tables IV and V. The resultant powders had a particle size of about 15 to 20 mesh, as shown in Table VIII. The powders were free flowing and did not agglomerate or block when packaged and stored under loads of about 2 psi at room temperature for 1 month. The volume density of these powders was about 20 lbs cu. ft. This example illustrates the preparation of free flowing fine powders from EPDM s of a wide variety of base compositions.Example 4 A set of sulfonated EPDM powders was prepared in which two metal acetates were used for neutralization. The starting EPDM is described in Example 2, and the preparation procedure was done according to Example 1. One batch of unneutralized sulfonated polymeric cement was neutralized with a sodium acetate solution and the other neutralized with a magnesium acetate solution. The metal acetate solutions were prepared by dis solving 1.297 pounds of Mg OOCCH3 r 4 H20 and 0.98 pounds of NaOOCCH3, respectively, in a mixture of 1.91 gallons of methanol and 0.096 gallon of water. The amount of metal acetate used corresponds to 60 meq. of metal ion per lOOgEPDM. The metal acetate solutions were added to the sulfonated cements to effect neutralization as described inExample 1. These neutralized cements were then formed into powders in the hi shear pipeline mixer, steam stripped and fluid bed dried according to the process described inExample 1. The elemental analyses, powder particle size distributions, physical and rheologica properties of the finished powders are given in Tables IV and V. The finished powders were subjected to storage under a load of about 2 psi for one month and found to remain as free flowing powders with no agglomeration. The volume density of the dried powder was about 20 pounds oer cubic foot. This example shows the application of this direct in process powder process for the production of powdered metal neutralized sulfonated EPDM polymers containing various metal counter ions.Example 5 An ammonium neutralized sulfonated EPDM plasticized with zinc stearate was prepared into a powder by the process described in Example 1. The ammonium sulfonated polymer cement was prepared by dissolving 20 pounds of an EPDM in 23.87 gallons of hexane. The EPDM used is described in Example 2. Sulfonation was effected as described in Example 1, and the sulfonated EPDM was neutralized through the addition of 0.925 pound of anhydrous ammonium acetate dissolved in 1.91 gallons of methanol and 0.096 pound of water. To the neutralized cement was added 1.90 pounds of zinc stearate plasticizer and 0.02 pound of Irganox 1010. The cement was agitated for an additional 2 hours. The cement was then processed through the hi shear mixer, steam stripped and fluid bed dried resulting in a powdered product as described in Example 1. This zinc stearate plasticized ammonium neutralized sulfonated EPDM powder was free flowing with an average particle size of about 10 to 20 mesh. The product powder showed no tendency toward agglomeration on storage at room temperature under a load of about 2 psi for 1 month.Example 6 Following the procedure described in Example 1, an amine neutralized sulfonated EPDM powder was produced.The starting EPDM is described in Example 2. The sulfonated polymer was neutralized through the addition of a solution containing 0.98 pound of anhydrous ammonium acetate dissolved in 1.91 gallons of methanol and 0.096 gallon of water.Irganox 1010 0.02 pounds was added and the reaction was maintained with agitation for an additional 30 minutes. The viscosity of the final cement was determined with a Brookfield viscometer , Model LVT, with spindle No. 3 at room temperature.

This ammonium neutralized sulfonated EPDM powder was free flowing with a particle size ranging between 10 and 20 mesh. No tendency for agglomeration of the powder particles was observed on storage at room temperature under a load of about 2 psi for 1 month. The composition and physical and rheological properties of this ammonium .neutralized sulfonated EPDM are given in Tables IV and V. This example demonstrates that free flowing powders of ammonium neutralized systems of small and uniform particle size can be efficiently produced via this process.Example 7SAMPLE A A zinc sulfonate EPDM plasticized with stearic acid and an oil was prepared from the EPDM described inExample 1 according to the procedure of Example 1. Sulfonation was effected on a cement of 14.5 pounds EPDM in 17.3 gallons of hexane with 1.15 pounds of acetic anhydride and 0.495 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid. The sulfonated polymer was neutralized with a solution of 1.89 pounds of zinc acetate in 1.38 gallons of methanol and 0.07 gallons of water. After 30 minutes of agitation, 1.23 pounds of stearic acid and 0.014 pounds of Irganox 1010 were added.After 2 hours of agitation, 6.5 pounds of a paraffinic rubber process oil, Sunpar 2280, was added. This corresponds to 75 parts by weight of oil per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer. The unplasticized neutralized polymer contained 35.1 meq. sulfonate and 117.6 meq. zinc lOOg EPDM.SAMPLE B Twenty pounds of an unplasticized zinc neutralized sulfonated EPDM gum was dissolved in 23.87 gallons of hexane and 3.58 gallons of isopropyl alcohol. The gum used was prepared according to the procedure described for Sample A except that the 20 Mooney EPDM described in Example 2 was used.According to sulfur and zinc analyses the modified polymer contained 31.4 meq. sulfonate and 56.8 meq. zinc per lOOg polymer. To the cement was added 1.90 pounds of zinc stearate. The cement was agitated for approximately 2 hours to allow for complete solution of the zinc stearate. To the cement was then added 10.6 pounds of a paraffinic process oil, Sunpar 2280, which corresponds to 50 parts by weight of oil per 100 parts by weight of the neutralized sulfonated polymer. The unplasticized neutralized polymer contained 36.7 meq. sulfonate and 91.6 meq. zinc lOOg EPDM. The physical and rheological properties of the plasticized and unplasticized systems are given in Table VI. The oil extended cements were formed into powders, isolated and finished using the same procedure as is described in Example 1. The addition of the process oil resulted in lower neutralized cement solution viscosity than is obtained in cements of the same gum compositions without the oil present, as is shown in Table VII. The resulting powders of these materials had a particle size ranging from 10 to 20 mesh with an overall size distribution as shown inTable VI. The volume density of the resultant powders was about 20 pounds cu. ft. The powders were stored under a 1.5 psi weight for one month and remained as free flowing powders with no agglomeration observed. As can be seen in Table VI the melt viscosity of these materials is relatively low due to the incorporation of the process oil. However, even at these levels of oil, an excellent powder was produced and maintained throughout all the process steps and in load storage.

The presence of these plasti cizers in metal sulfonated EPDM results in the lowering of the met viscosity sufficiently to allow for processability in operations such as injection molding and extrusion. This series of runs demonstrates that small particle size powders of these plasticized materials can be produced directly in process through the use of an in line hi shear mixer as described in Example 1.Further, these resultant powders remain as free flowing powders without any agglomeration during the steam stripping process, the drying process or in subsequent shelf storage conditions. Table VIE lists the ingredients and quantity used for each composition studied. Three EPDM s were used and are described below.

MD 76 3 20 75 5MD 76 5 20 55 5 R 521 40 .. 50 5 The preparation procedure followed for this series of compositions is as described below. The EPDM was dissolved in n hexane and sulfonated by the addition of acetic anhydride followed by concentrated sulfuric acid. Samples of this unneutralized sulfonated polymer were taken for sulfur analysis. After allowing the sulfonation reaction to proceed for 60 minutes, the sulfonated po lymers were neutralized with a solution of the appropriate metal acetate dissolved in methanol and water.The neutralization reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes, at which time the appropriate plasticizer was added as a dry powder. After an additional 15 minutes of agitation, Irganox 1010 was added. The plasticized and neutralized sulfonated EPDM cements were then isolated and finished as powders. The cement was pumped from the reactor through the in line hi shear mixer nozzle and pump assembly. In the nozzle the cement was contacted with 65 C water. The cement flow rate was 0.5 GPM and the water flow rate was 2.8 GPM. On passing through the tandem shear head assembly of the mixer, the cement was broken into small discrete particles that were dispersed into the water to form a slurry. The use of hot water improves the shearing efficiency in the hi shear mixer. On contact with water the cement viscosity increases rapidlyand,c in the presence of sufficient water, the cement forms a gel.It has been found, surprisingly, that the efficiency of powder formation improves as the viscosity of the cement increases. By contacting the cement with hot water significant solvent flashing from the cement occurs rapidly as the water cement system passes through the shear heads of the in line mixer. Since the rate of solvent flashing is a function of particle size or particle surface area, as the shearing process takes place and generates small polymeric cement particles, very rapid and efficient solvent flashing occurs. This removal of a significant fraction of the original solvent from the polymeric cement results in a material whose properties are approaching those of the isolated neutralized sulfonated EPDM itself.As the tenacity of the cement increases due to the incorporation of water and to the flashing off of the solvent, the shearing action of the mixer produces smaller, more uniform particles. The water cement slurry was then piped into the steam stripper where the remaining solvent was flashed off.The wet powder was then dried in a Fitzpatrick FA 75 fluid bed drier to a final moisture content of less than 1 weight water. Table lx gives the sulfur and metal contents of the gums described in this series. The tensile strengths of the gums were determined using microdumbbels at both room temperature and 70 C with an Instron TM table model instrument at a pull rate of 2 inches per minute. The melt viscosities of the samplesweredetermined with an Instron table model capillary rheometer at 2000 C over various shear rates.These data are given in Table X. The described method for the direct in process manufacture of powders from plasticized and metal neutralized sulfonated EPDM shows the process to be applicable for material with melt flow viscosities down to 5 x 105 dynes cm2 at a shear rate of 0.88 sec 1 as shown in Table X . The solution viscosities of the plasticized neutralized cements are given in Table XI. The resulting powders showed no tendency to agglomerate in process, through either the stripping or fluid bed drying steps. The particle size of the isolated dry powders ranged from 10 to 20 mesh with an overall narrow particle size distribution as shown in Table XII. These powders remained in a free flowing form after 1 month storage under a 1.5 psi load.The volume density of the powders ranged fs m 15 to 25 pounds per cubic foot. TABLE VIII Acetic Conc.

To a midget Banbury was charged 66.9 gm of this zinc neutralized sulfonated EPDM powder. Then 100.3 gm of Tufflo 6056 oil and 132.7 gm of blended powdered additives were added.This blend of additives contained 12.0 gm of zinc stearate, 100.3 gm of ImsilA 108, 20.1 gm of polypropylene, MFR 20 and 0.3 gm of stabilizer. The mix was run for 5 minutes and the compound was dumped at a temperature of 160 C. It was found surprisingly that this mix procedure in which the zinc sulfonate EPDM powder was added first gave a very well dispersed, homogeneous mix. This is not the case with large size crumb, 1 4 and larger, which require the oil and fillers, particularly the zinc stearate, to be added first in order to achieve a homogeneous mix. The mechanical and physical properties of the final compound are given below.

The cement was pumped from the reactor into the nozzle assembly of an in line hi shear mixer and contacted with 20 C water.The water was held at a flow rate of 2.85 gallons per minute and the cement flow rate was maintained at 1500 ml min. This water cement mixture then passed through the hi shear mixer where the cement was dispersed as a slurry into the water. The 2 Greerco hi shear pipeline mixer was fitted with the standard Greerco tandem shear head configuration.This consists of a two stage mixing head system with two turbines and stators in tandem. The primary stator has eight 7 16 diameter holes and the multiport stator has 50 1 8 ports. A series of runs was made in which the speed of the Greerco mixer was varied from about 10,000 RPM to about 6,000 RPM. At 6,000 RPM s very poor dispersions of the cement into the water were realized. At 10,000 RPM s the cement was dispersed as discrete particles into the water with a size of about 10 mesh. The powder was then steam stripped and fluid bed dried.Example 11 The zinc neutralized sulfonated EPDM cement prepared in Example 10 was used to determine the effect of water temperature on process efficiency and powder particle size. This cement was processed through the equipment setup and procedures described in the above example. Water temperatures of 20 , 55 , 65 and 90 C were investigated. The water flow rate was held at 2.85 gallons per minute, a cement flow rate of 3680 ml minute was used and the mixer was run at 10,000RPM. With the water temperature at 20 C, a very coarse crumb was produced. This crumb had a particle size of about 1 8 to 1 4 . At 650 and 90 C a fine, uniform powder, well dispersed in the water was produced. This powder had a particle size of about 10 mesh.Example 12 The zinc sulfonate EPDM described in Example 2 was used to make a compound following dry blending techniques.The formulation ingredients were as follows Sulfonated Elastomer 100 parts 17H35CO0 2Zn 18 parts Tufflo 6056 150 parts Imsil A 108 150 parts CD 460, Polypropylene 30 parts DSTDP, Stabilizer 0.4 parts Irganox 1010 0.4 parts TiO2 4.0 partsThe powdered sulfonate elastomer was placed into a onegallon laboratory Waring blender and with slow agitation the process oil was added. The agitation was increased to maximum and maintained for about 20 seconds. The oilsoaked powder, which remained as a free flowing powder was then transferred to a 4Rliter beaker and the remaining fillers were added. The mixture was then stirred by hand until visual observation suggested a homogeneous mix had been obtained. The homogeneous dry blend was then fed into a Boy injection molding machine. Samples were molded at 2200, 240 , and 260 C with no process difficulties. Properties of the samples molded at 220 C are given below and compared to properties of the same compound prepared in a Banbury. TheBanbury samples were prepared from the same batch of pow dered gum as was used for the dry blends.

The cement was pumped from the reactor into the nozzle assembly of the in line mixer as shown in Figure 1 and contacted with water at 20 C. On contact with the water, the viscosity of the cement experienced a marked increase going from a fluid with a viscosity of 3,000 cps Brookfield LVT viscometer, at 250C,No3 spindle, 6 RPM to a gel. The gel was then broken into small, discrete particles and dispersed into the water as the water gel system passed through the shearing heads of the in line hi shear mixer. The powder was then steam stripped and fluid bed dried.With this cement, a series of runs was made in which the flow rates of water to cement through the hi shear mixer was varied Table XIII . The water temperature was held at 5 to 100C and the water flow rate held at 2.8 gallons per minute.The cement temperature was 250C and the cement flow rate varied between 0.2 and 0.64 gallons per minute. Under all conditions the dried product powder particle size was between 10 and 20 mesh. The resultant products were freeflowing powders and did not agglomerate when stored in bags at room temperature for 2 weeks.

The starting polystyrene had a number average molecular weight of 230,000, a weight average molecular weight of 375,000 and an ASTMD 1238 condition G melt index of 18 grams in 10 minutes.The polystyrene 200 g was dissolved in 1000 ml of 1,2dichloroethane at 500C. To the 50 C solution was added 122.5 ml of acetic anhydride followed by 44.9 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture was then stirred for one hour. The sulfonated polystyrene was neutralized with a solution of 191.7 gm. of copper acetate di hydrate dissolved in 500 ml of dimethyl formamide. The cement was then agitated for an additional hour, then cooled to room temperature. The cement was then broken up into small, discrete particles suspended in water using a Waring Blender.The blender was charged with one volume of cement to one volume of 200C water. The cement water slurry was then steam stripped in a four liter beaker fitted with a high speed agitator. After stripping the powdered product was dried in a vacuum oven at 1000C The dried neutralized powder contained 5.4 weight sulfur 21.6 mole sulfonate and 5.9 weight copper.The final product particle size was less than 100 mesh. This example demonstrates the preparation of powders from high sulfonate content polymers.Example 15 Butyl 365 Exxon Chemical Co. was depolymerized in a hot extruder from its original Mooney viscosity M.L., 1 8, 2120F of about 45 to a Mooney viscosity of below 5. Butyl 365 contains about 2 mole percent unsaturation. To a solution of 200 gm of depolymerized Butyl 365 in 2000 ml of hexane at room temperature was added 20.1 ml of acetic anhydride followed by 7.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes the sulfonatedButyl rubber was neutralized with a solution of 26.3 gm of zinc acetate dihydrate in 160 ml of methanol and 8 ml of water. Irganox 1010 0.2 gm was then added, and the cement was stirred for one hour. The cement was then broken up into small, discrete particles suspended in water using a Waring blender.The blender was charged with appromimately one volume of cement to one volume of 200C water. The cement water slurry was then steam stripped in a four liter beaker fitted with a high speed agitator. After stripping the powdered zinc neutralized sulfonated butyl was dried in a laboratory fluid bed dryer to a final moisture content of less than 1 wt. water. The dried neutralized powder contained 1.54 wt. sulfur 51.6 meq. sulfonate lOOg polymer and 2.96 wt. zinc 97.1 meq Zn lOOg polymer . The dried powder had a particle size range of between 10 and 20 mesh. The powder remained as a free flowing powder when stored under a 2 psi load for one week.Example 16 The applicability of the direct in process manufacture of zinc sulfonate containing EPDM polymers at sulfur levels of 20 to 25 meq sulfonate groups lOOg EPDM was studied using two different ethylene content EPDM s. Sample A was made from an EPDM containing 55 wt. ethylene and 5 wit.7. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and having a Mooney viscosity of about 20 ML, 1 8, 212OF . and Sample B from an EPDM containing 70 wt. ethylene and 5 wt. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and having a Moonev viscosity of 20 M.L. 1 8, 2120 F. To a solution of 20 pounds of EPDM in 23.9 gallons of hexane at room temperature was added 1.51 pounds of acetic anhydride followed by 0.49 pounds of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes the sulfonation was terminated, and the unneutralized sulfonated polymer was neutralized through the addition of a solution containing 1.32 pounds of zinc acetate dissolved in 2.72 gallons of methanol and 0.14 gallon of water. After 30 minutes of reaction with agitation 1.27 pounds of dry zinc stearate and 0.02 pound of Irganox 1010 were sprinkled into the reaction vessel. Mixing was continued for an additional 90 minutes to complete the batch.The products were then processed through isolation, stripping and drying to produce powders according to the methods described in Example 1. Table XIV,lists the compositions, rheological, and stress strain properties of the finished gums as well as the particle size distributions of the powders. The neutralized cement viscosities for these systems are given in Table XV. The resultant powders from both systems were free flowing and showed no agglomeration through storage under loads of about 2 psi at room temperature for one month. This example shows the application of this powder process technique to metal sulfonate containing EPDM systems at lower sulfonate levels.

A metal neutralized EPDM powder was produced in which the sulfonation was carried out on an 18 wit.7, solidEPDM in hexane cement. The EPDM used was Royalene 521, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Company. This EPDM contained 49 wt. ethylene and 4.9 wt. 5 ethylidene 2 norbordene and had a Mooney viscosity of 45 M.L., 1 8, 2120F .The equipment and processing procedures used for preparation, isolation,stripping and drying of the polymer were identical to those described in Example 1. 28.87 pounds of EPDM were dissolved in 23.87 gallons of hexane. This yielded a starting EPDM cement containing 18 Wt.Z solid. Table XVi gives the solution viscosity at room temperature of this cement over a range of shear rates. To the cement was added 2.297 pounds of acetic anhydride followed by 0.989 pound of concentrated sulfuric acid. After 30 minutes the sulfonation was terminated and the sulfonated polymer was neutralized through the addition of a solution of 3.79 pounds of zinc acetate in 2.6 gallons of methanol and 0.14 gallons of water. After 30 minutes of agitation, 2.45 pounds of stearic acid and 0.029 paunds of Irganox 1010 were added.Table XVITgives the cement viscosity over a range of shear rates. This high viscosity cement was processed through the hi shear mixer under the same conditions as were used in the preceding examples with the same process efficiency.The resulting product was a free flowing powder with a particle size range between 10 and 20 mesh see Table XVIII The composition, physical and rheological properties of this material are given in Table XVIII. These results demonstrate that free flowing, small size powders can be efficiently produced with cements containing up to 18 wt. solids and having solution viscosities up to 50,000 cps.
