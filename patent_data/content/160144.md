# Alkylation of aromatic molecules using a silica alumina catalyst derived from zeolite.

## Abstract
Aromatic molecules are alkylated using a silica alumina catalyst derived from zeolite. The silica alumina catalyst is a partially collapsed zeolite, i.e., a material of reduced crystal linity. The alkylation process which employs this material of reduced crystallinity is characterized by a high level of selectivity for the production of monoalkylated product.
