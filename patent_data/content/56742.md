# Recovery of molybdenum from spent catalyst solutions from hydroperoxide epoxidations.

## Abstract
In the process of recovering molybdenum from a spent catalyst solution obtained from a crude reaction product of a molybdenum catalyzed epoxidation of an olefin with an organic hydroperoxide from which crude reaction product epoxide and an alcohol corresponding to the hydroperoxide is removed, the improvement comprises removing and recovering dissolved molybdenum as a high molybdenum content solid by subjecting the spent catalyst solution to a liquid to liquid extraction with an aqueous extract to form a two phase system, separating the molybdenum rich aqueous extract and precipitating therefrom a high molybde num content solid by heating the aqueous extract in the presence of hydrogen sulfide or a water soluble sulfide salt.
