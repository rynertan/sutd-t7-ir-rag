# An electric device and a method for wiring the same.

## Abstract
A method of wiring an electric device, particularly an electric tool, comprises engaging conductor wires 13, 14 15, 16 19 adjacent the ends thereof in bores 24, 25, 26, 27 and or grooves 29a, 30, 31, 32 provided in plastic carrier elements 20 50 60, 61 , with bared ends of at least some of the conductor wires protruding from these carrier elements 20 60, 61 . Then inserting the carrier elements 20 50 60, 61 , with the conductor wires 13, 14 15, 16 19 engaged therein, into at least part of the housing 1 2 of the electric device. And, electrically connecting the conductor wires 13, 14 15, 16 19 by plugging carrier elements 20 50 60, 61 together and or to an electrical component 3 6 of the electric device, with said protruding bared ends functioning as plug pins. Preferably, the conductor wires each have a single solid conducting core having a cross sectional area in the range of 1 to 5 mm. Such relatively rigid wires can be pre shaped before insertion into a housing of the electric device. The rigidity of the wires, their pre shaping, the carrier elements and the protruding bared ends of the wires enable the wiring of the device to be carried out mechanically.
