# LH RH Antagonists.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel peptides and peptide derivatives which act as antagonists of natural LH RH and have the general formula X R¹ R² R³ Ser Tyr R⁴ R⁵ R⁶ R⁷ R⁸ NH₂ wherein X represents hydrogen or a lower acyl 1 6 C group, R¹ and R² represent either the same or different groups selected from D Bal 2 , D Bal 3 , D Nal 1 , D Nal 2 , D Phe or D Phe substituted at the phenyl moiety by one or more halogen, alkyl 1 4C , alkoxy 1 4 C or nitro groups R³ represents D Trp, D Bal 2 , D Bal 3 , D Nal 1 , D Nal 2 or D Pal, with the proviso that at least one of the symbols R¹ or R³ represents a D Bal 2 or D Bal 3 group R⁴ represents D Arg, D Lys, D homo Arg or D dialkyl 1 4 C homo Arg R⁵ represents L Leu, L Met or the alkyl 1 4C or phenylalkyl 7 10C ether of L Cys, L Ser or L homo Ser R⁶ represents L Lys or L Arg R⁷ represents L Pro or L thiaprolyl, and R⁸ represents D Ala or Gly. The invention also includes the acid addition salts of the above defined peptides.
