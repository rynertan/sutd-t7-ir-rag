# Improvements in or relating to honing devices.

## Abstract
Cylinders 57 are manufactured to an oval shape, which is defined as being an oval where the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis is between 1.1 1 and 3 1. Cylinders are generally finished by a honing machine but, in general, conventional honing machines cannot hone such oval profiles at commercial production rates. Disclosed is a honing machine for finishing such oval cylinders where the honing stones 52 are constrained always to bear against the surface of the cylinder with a constant force, regardless of their position relative to a central shaft 50 through which they are rotated.
