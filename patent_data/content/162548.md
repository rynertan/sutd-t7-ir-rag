# Method for formation of metal compound coating.

## Abstract
A method for forming on the surface of a sintered article of silicon nitride type ceramic a coating film of a compound containing titanium or zirconium is disclosed. This metal compound coating is easily and inexpensively obtained by placing a metal containing substance such as, for example, titanium dioxide in contact with a sintered article of silicon nitride type ceramic and sintering the resultant composite in a non oxidative atmosphere.
