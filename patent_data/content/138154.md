## Description
The present invention relates to one component alkoxy functional room temperature vulcanizable RTV compositions, and methods for making such RTV compostions. Recently a shelf stable, fast curing, one component, alkoxy functional RTV composition was disclosed in the patent of White et al., EP A 69256. Basically White et al. teach that moisture curable, polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane RTV compositions can be made by combining The scavenger of White et al. can be part of the crosslinking silane or a separate compound and must contain a hydrolyzable functional group selected from the group consisting of amido, amino, carbamato, enoxy, imidato, isocyanato, oximato, thioisocyanato and ureido. Shortly after the pioneering invention of White et al. it was discovered that compounds other than those disclosed by White et al. could be utilized as scavengers for chemically combined hydroxy groups or as integrated scavenger crosslinkers. Patent 83 7984 of the Republic of South Africa discloses additional silazane scavengers which improve upon those disclosed by Dziark in that they function not only as scavengers for chemically combined hydroxy groups, but as integrated scavenger crosslinkers. One shortcoming of one component alkoxy functional RTV compositions such as those described in said U.S.Patent 4,417,042 and said South African Patent 83 7984 is that they tend to be slightly corrosive towards certain metals such as copper and brass. It is believed that this is due to the low molecular weight amino by products of the scavenging reaction NH₃ in the case of scavengers such as hexamethyldisilazane causing contact and vapor corrosion of the metal substrate. It should be noted that such corrosion is not extreme as it manifests itself primarily in the form of a dark discoloration. Another object of the present invention is to provide silicone RTV compositions which contain scavenging compounds for chemically combined hydroxy groups whose by product of the scavenging reaction is innocuous towards the metal substrate. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of making silicone RTV compositions which contain said scavenging compounds. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a silicone RTV composition comprising According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for making such composition as defined in claim 24. Notwithstanding the aforementioned difference, formula 1 in the formula of the scavenger R can be a substituted or unsubstituted organo group having at least two carbon atoms. Preferably R is a C₂ ₁₃ aliphatic organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylether, alkylester, alkylketone and alkylcyano radicals or a C₆ ₃₀ aromatic organic radical selected from aryl, aralkyl and alkaryl. More preferably, R is a C₃ ₈ linear aliphatic organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl alkylether and alkylketone or a C₆ ₁₈ aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl radical. R¹ is a hydrolyzable leaving group selected from the group consisting of alkoxy, amido, amino, carbamato, enoxy, imidato, isocyanato, oximato, thioisocyanato and ureido radicals. Preferably the hydrolyzable group or radical contains from 1 to 13 carbon atoms and more preferably has from 1 to 8 carbon atoms however, hydrolyzable groups having more than 13 carbon atoms are within the scope of the instant invention. Most preferably R¹ is methoxy or ethoxy. R² and R³ are independently selected C₁ ₁₃ monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals. Preferably, R² and R³ have from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and they are unsubstituted, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Other suitable radicals include halogenated hydrocarbon radicals, cyanoalkyl radicals, and alkaryl radicals. Most preferably R² and R³ are either methyl or ethyl. R⁴ is defined the same as R¹, and preferably R¹ and R⁴ are the same. Accordingly it is most preferable that R¹ and R⁴ are both methoxy or ethoxy. The most preferred compounds within the scope of formula 1 are Other compounds within the scope of formula 1 include Examples of compounds effective as scavengers for chemically combined hydroxy groups within the scope of formula 1 , include It should be noted that the critical aspect of the scavengers of formula 1 is that there must be at least one hydrolyzable R¹ group. The reason for this is that after the scavenging reaction eliminates substantially all of the chemically combined hydroxy groups in the RTV composition, there will remain in the RTV composition a scavenging reaction product which contains the hydrolyzable R¹ group. Thus when the RTV composition is applied to a substrate and curing effected, the residual scavenger will be chemically bound into the cured elastomer as R¹ will react with the hydrolyzable end units of the base silicone polymer. The foregoing is best illustrated by the case wherein the base diorganopolysiloxane is silanol endstopped i.e. it has the general formula where R⁷ is a C₁ ₁₃ monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical, which is preferably methyl or a mixture of a major amount of methyl and a minor amount of phenyl, cyanoethyl, trifluoropropyl, vinyl and mixtures thereof, and n is an integer having a value of from about 50 to about 2500. It is believed that the scavenger of formula 1 will cleave between the silyl silicon atom and the nitrogen atom as follows It is also believed that the scavenging reaction product either before or upon exposure of the RTV to the atmosphere to effect curing further scavenges chemically combined hydroxy groups to form a compound of the formula where R⁷ is hydrogen or a C₁ ₁₃ organic group. Since this has at least two hydrolyzable groups it can act as a coupler or crosslinker and hence be incorporated into the cured elastomer. Another theory is that the scavenging reaction product degrades as described above and endcaps silanol polymer much the same as did the R⁴ endstopped organopolysiloxane. In any event, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that if a silanol endstopped base polymer diorganopolysiloxane is employed it is desirable that y equals 0 or 1. Thus when the silanol chainstopper reacts with the scavenger of the formula, for example, the base polymer will contain at least two terminal hydrolyzable groups which are necessary to effect crosslinking i.e. curing . Of course, it is also possible to use as the base polymer a diorganopolysiloxane wherein the silicon atom at each polymer chain end is terminated with at least two hydrolyzable radicals which normally are alkoxy radicals. In such case it is not necessary that the scavenger contain any hydrolyzable R⁴ groups. It is not desirable that the base polymer be endstopped with only one hydrolyzable group as in such case coupling rather than crosslinking would occur upon curing. This is not to say that monohydrolyzable e.g. monoalkoxy endstopped polymer cannot be included in the base silicone polymer of the present invention. The reader interested in obtaining further information on the use of such monohydrolyzable base polymer is referred to patent 83 7557 of the Republic of South Africa. The silicone base polymers of the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art and can be made by various procedures. For further information the reader is referred to White et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,395,5268. Inasmuch as the synthesis of 1,1 diethoxy 2 trimethylsilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane is described in The Journal of Organic Chemistry , Vol. 34, No. 11, November, 1969, it is only necessary to describe the method for making the scavengers. Generally the method for preparing the scavengers is similar to the method for preparing 1,1 diethoxy 2 trimethylsilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane. However, instead of reacting 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and hexamethyldisilazane in the presence of ammonium sulfate, there is reacted, for example, 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and a disilazane having an appropriate number of hydrolyzable radicals, for example α ,ω dimethoxytetramethyldisilazane, in the presence of an acid type catalyst such as ammonium sulfate or the like. Broadly stated the method for preparing the scavengers is illustrated by the following reaction where R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴, x and y are all as previously defined. It will be obvious to the skilled artisan that the silazane need not be a disilazane, but can be any silazane having the appropriate hydrolyzable groups attached to the terminal silicon atoms. Furthermore, it will be obvious that the radicals attached to the silicon atom contained in the ring are determined by the aminosilane reactant, e.g. aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and the radicals attached to the silyl type silicon atom are determined by the silazane employed, e.g. α,ω,dimethoxytetramethyldisilazane. Another method for preparing the scavengers is illustrated by the following reaction where R, R¹, R². R³, R⁴ are as previously defined, x is equal to 1 to 3 and y is equal to 0 to 3, and X is a halogen, most preferably chlorine. The catalyst of the RTV composition of the instant invention can be any suitable condensation catalyst. A rather exhaustive listing of suitable condensation catalysts is provided in the disclosure of White et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,395,526. However, it should be noted that tin compounds are the preferred condensation catalysts with dibutyltindi t butoxide being the most preferred. Furthermore, it is more desirable to use tin salts of long chain carboxylic acids such as laurate, neodecanoate and the like rather than tin salts of short chain carboxylic acids such as formate, acetate and the like, due to the lower corrosivity of the long chain acid salts. Of course, selecting a suitable condensation catalyst is easily done by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. As mentioned hereinabove, if the base polymer is silanol terminated it may be necessary or desirable to include an effective amount of alkoxy functional crosslinking agent of the formula where R⁵, R⁶, and b are as previously defined. It should be understood that in those instances where the scavenger for hydroxy functional groups does not also function as a crosslinking agent, it is necessary that crosslinking agent of formula 3 must be included in the composition, otherwise crosslinking to effect cure of the composition would not be possible. Preferably the crosslinking agent has the formula and most preferably is methyltrimethoxysilane. Various fillers can also be incorporated into the RTV composition of the present invention, for example, titanium dioxide, zirconium silicate, silica aerogel, iron oxide, diatomaceous earth, fumed silica, carbon black, precipitated silica, glass fibers, polyvinylchloride, ground quartz and calcium carbonate. The amount of filler utilized can be varied over wide limits in accordance with the intended use. For example, in some sealant applications the curable composition can be used free of filler whereas in other applications, such as utilizing the curable composition for making binder material, as much as 700 parts or more of filler per 100 parts of organopolysiloxane on a weight basis can be employed. Preferably the filler is present in an amount ranging from 10 to 300 parts per 100 parts organopolysiloxane. It is also within the scope of the present invention to incorporate small amounts of adhesion promoter, typically 0.1 to 5 by weight, into the RTV composition so as to provide primerless adhesion of the RTV composition to the substrate. Although any suitable adhesion promotor can be employed, it has been found that silane compounds having mixed alkoxy amino, alkoxy vinyl, alkoxy epoxide, alkoxy cyano, alkoxy isocyanurate or alkoxy ester functionality are particularly effective. The preferred adhesion promoters include The most preferred adhesion promoters are tris trimethoxysilylpropyl isocyanurate and 3 2 aminoethylamino propyltrimethoxysilane. Other additives which can be added to the RTV composition of the present invention include sag control agents, plasticizers, cure accelerators and the like. So that those skilled in the art might be better able to practice the present invention, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Preparation of 1,1 diethoxy 2 trimethylsilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane CAS Reg. No. 21297 72 3 a three neck round bottom flask fitted with a thermometer, a magnetic stirrer, condenser and nitrogen inlet outlet was evacuated and filled with nitrogen. The flask was charged with 20 g. NH₄ ₂SO₄, 1.5 moles γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and 1.5 moles hexamethyldisilazane. The reaction mixture was heated to 100 C for approximately 20 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled, filtered and distilled to give 1,1 diethoxy 2 trimethylsilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane. The product was identified by its boiling point literature b.p. 210 C and infared spectrum. Employing the apparatus of Example 1, there was charged to the reaction flask 20 g NH₄ ₂SO₄, 4 moles γ aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 4 mole α,ω dimethoxypolydimethylsilazane. The reaction mixture was heated at 130 C overnight. After cooling the mixture was filtered and the volatiles were stripped off. The remaining pot constituted an equilibrium mixture of 1,1 dialkoxy 2 dimethylalkoxy 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane where alkoxy was a mixture of methoxy and ethoxy groups. Identification of the various substituents was made from g.c. mass spec. data. A suitable mixer equipped with a vacuum line and nitrogen purge was charged with 100 parts by weight methyldimethoxy end stopped polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity of about 25,000 cps at 25 C 1.4 parts by weight β cyanoethyltrimethoxysilane, 17.4 parts by weight of fumed silica treated with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and 15 parts by weight of dimethylpolysiloxane fluid having a viscosity of about 100 in mPa.s at 25 C as a plasticizer. This mixture was agitated under vacuum 2660 PA 20 mm Hg at room temperature for 1 hour to give an RTV base. To 100 parts by weight of this base was added 2 parts by weight 1,1 diethoxy 2 dimethylmethoxysilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclo pentane 0.5 parts by weight aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 0.5 parts by weight methyltrimethoxysilane and 0.2 parts by weight dibutyltindi t butoxide using a Semco catalyzer mixer. Following mixing, a complete property profile was obtained as set forth in Table I. Example 3 was repeated but 0.5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight base of tris trimethyoxysilylpropyl isocyanurate was used as co adhesion promoter instead of aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane. Also the condensation catalyst employed was 0.2 parts by weight dibutyltindiacetate rather than dibutyltindi t butoxide. Again, a complete property profile was obtained as set forth in Table II. Example 3 was again repeated, but 0.25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight base of dibutyltindilaurate was used as the catalyst. The results of the property profile obtained are set forth in Table III. A suitable mixer equipped with a vacuum line and nitrogen purge was charged with 100 parts by weight methyldimethoxy endstopped polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity of 12000 cps at 25 6, 1.4 parts by weight cyanoethyltrimethoxysilane, 20 parts by weight octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane treated fumed silica, and 15 parts by weight of a dimethylpolysiloxane fluid having a viscosity of 100 cps at 25 C as a plasticizer. This mixture was agitated under vacuum 20 mm Hg at room temperature for 1 hour to give an RTV base. To 100 parts by weight of this base was added 2 parts by weight 1,1 diethoxy 2 trimethylsilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane 0.5 parts by weight aminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane 0.5 parts by weight methyltrimethoxysilane and 0.2 parts by weight dibutyltindi t butoxide using a 15 minute mix at room temperature in a Semco catalyzer mixer. A physical property profile was done at room temperature after heat aging for 48 hours at 100 6. The results are set forth in Table IV. To establish that RTV compositions prepared in accordance with the present invention are less corrosive than prior art compositions, a sample was prepared according to Example 3, but the 1,1 diethoxy 2 dimethylmethoxysilyl 1 sila 2 azacyclopentane was replaced with the hexamethyldisilazane scavenger described in U.S. Patent 4,417,042. The corrosiveness of the composition was evaluated for vapor and contact corrosion as per Mil A 46146 U.S. Department of Defense Military Specification as follows Two panels 10 x 2,5 cm 4 inches by 1 inch were prepared from a copper alloy sheet by cleaning with a number 400 emery cloth, rinsing with acetone and blotting dry. 15 grams of the hexamethyldisilazane containing RTV composition were extruded into an 240ml 8 ounce glass bottle equipped with a polytetrafluoroethylene cup. Five to ten milliliters of distilled water were poured over the RTV composition and one brass panel was hung above the silicone and water mix. The bottle was then tightly capped. The second panel was hung in a control bottle containing five to ten milliliters of distilled water only. The test and control bottles were maintained at 38 2 C 100 4 F for 7 days. At the end of this period the panels were removed from the bottles and visually inspected for corrosion and or discoloration. The control panel remained unchanged whereas the test panel was severely discolored, thus failing the vapor corrosion test. Two 38mm 1.5 inch lengths of AWG size copper wire were prepared by removing all insulation and then cleaning with acetone. One wire specimen was encapsulated by placing it into a mold 25 x 50 x 6 mm 1 inch by 2 inches by 1 4 inch and filling the mold with the same RTV composition used in the vapor corrosion test. The composition was cured at 25 C 77 F and 50 relative humidity for 7 days. The thus encapsulated specimen and the second unpotted control wire specimen were placed in a 95 relative humidity, 50 C 120 F environment for 28 days. At the end of the test period the wires were visually inspected for corrosion and or discoloration. The unpotted wire was unchanged whereas the potted wire exhibited severe dark discoloration, thus failing the contact corrosion test. Vapor and contact corrosion tests as described in Example 7 were performed on an acetoxy type seal ant within the scope of the claims of U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,296,161, 3,296,195 and 3,382,205 sold by General Electric Company under the trademark 5 5 1201 with the following results As can be seen from Tables I through IV, unlike prior art RTV compositions, the RTV compositions of the present invention are less corrosive.
