# Apparatus for storing analog signal samples.

## Abstract
Storage of an analog signal sample is achieved by con verting the incoming analog sample to a digital sample, by storing the digital sample in a digital memory 7 and by converting the sample read from the memory to an outgoing analog sample. Very good likeness between the incoming and outgoing samples is attained by using due to a writing order for the analog digital conversion a conventional closed loop comprising an analog comparator 2 , an iterative logic 3 and a digital analog converter 6 , as well as by discon necting the digital analog converter 6 with the aid of discon nection means 4 and 5 when the logic 3 has completed the iterative process, as well as by connecting, due to a reading order the reading output of the memory 7 to the converter 6 which then generates the outgoing analog sample. A con trol unit 9 prevents reading from the memory 7 when an iterative process is in progress.
