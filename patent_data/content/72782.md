# Method and apparatus for eliminating aerosol particles in display screen environments.

## Abstract
A screen 1 is provided for screening off aerosol particles in display screen environments, and includes an electrically conductive earthed frame 2 across which is stretched a fine mesh net 3 of an electrically non conducting material and electrically conductive wires 4 in contact with the net 3 and extending between opposing portions of the frame 2 , said screen neutralizing particle flows generated by electric fields between display screen and display reader.
