# Means for interfacing a web of thermoplastic material with an undulating and rotating peripheral surface.

## Abstract
A means for interfacing a web of continuously formed thermoplastic material with a continuously un dulating and rotating peripheral surface of a mold 22 having multiple cavities therein, comprises elongated bracket means 120D extending longitudinally of said web and pivotally mounted on a transverse axis at its upstream end for rotation toward and away from said peripheral surface, a plurality of parallel roller means 120 through which said web is threaded in a serpen tine manner, downstream roller means 120C to follow said peripheral surface, and upstream roller means 120D having an axis of rotation substantially coincident with the said transverse pivotal axis of said bracket means 120D . By the said means the inertia at the interface between the rotating polygonal mold 22 and a biaxial orientation apparatus 16, 18 is reduced to an optimal minimum to minimize resulting longitudinal stresses in said web.
