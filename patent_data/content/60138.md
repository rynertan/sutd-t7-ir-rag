# Low density porous cross linked polymeric materials and their preparation.

## Abstract
Cross linked homogenous porous polymeric materials are prepared by polymerisation of monomers as the con tinuous phase in a high internal phase emulsion having above a critical limit of surfactant to ensure adequate absorbtivity. The porous materials may be dried and refilled with selected liquids and act as a high capacity reservoir.
