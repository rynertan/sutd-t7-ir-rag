# CUVETTE ROTORS FOR CENTRIFUGAL ANALYZERS

## Abstract
A multicuvette rotor for use in a centrifugal analyzer that includes a rotor drive for rotating the rotor at rates greater than one thousand rpm for mixing reactants and performing analyses while the rotor is being driven in rotation defines a circumferential array of elongated radially extending cuvet tes. Each elongated cuvette defines a first chamber for receiving a first reactant and a loading port through which the first reactant is introduced into the first chamber region, a second chamber region for receiving a second reactant and a loading port through which the second reactant is introduced into the second chamber region, and divider structure between the first and second chamber regions that provides a transfer passage between the first and second chamber regions through which the first reactant may be flowed into the second chamber region for forming a reaction product with the second reactant. An analysis region is defined adjacent the radially outer wall of each cuvette where the resulting reaction product is subjected to analysis, the analysis regions being disposed in a circumferential array adjacent the periphery of the rotor, and mechanical interlock structure that is radially aligned with the analysis regions is adapted to receive a thermal sensor carried by the rotor drive for monitoring analysis region temperature during data acquisition.
