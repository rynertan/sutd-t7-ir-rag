# CENTRALIZED LOOM CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A centralized loom control system for controlling a group of looms 13 comprises a host CPU 1 , a plurality of local CPUs 2 provided on each of the group of looms 13 to control the opeation of the associated loom 13 , a plurality of communication control CPUs 3 each provided on a data bus 5 interconnecting the host CPUs 1 and the local CPUs 2 provided on each loom 13 to exchange data with both the host CPU 1 and the associated local CPUs 2 , and a memory 4 connected to each communication control CPU 3 to store temporarily the data given to the associated communication control CPU 3 from the host CPU 1 and from the associated local CPUs 2 . The centralized loom control system enchances the apparent data transmission speed of data transmission betweedn the host CPU and the looms to achieve the high speed centralized control of a plurality of groups of looms.
