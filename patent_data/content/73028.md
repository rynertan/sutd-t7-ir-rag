# AUTOMOTIVE ENGINE WITH KNOCK SENSOR

## Abstract
An automotive internal combustion engine comprises a cylinder block having at its bottom part with a plurality of main bearings, a bearing beam structure secured to the bottom part of the cylinder block and including a plurality of main bearing cap sections each of which associates with each main bearing of the cylinder block to rotatably support a crankshaft, and at least a beam section for securely connecting the bearing cap sections with each other, and an engine knock sensor for detecting engine knock and located at a part of the bearing beam structure, thereby sensitively detecting engine knock while effectively reducing engine noise.
