# Semiconductor integrated circuit device having a high tolerance of abnormal high input voltages.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device having a high tolerance against abnormal high input voltages comprises a first MIS transistor T2 forming the input stage and a second MIS transistor T1 forming part of the internal circuit elements of the device. The source 30 or drain 31 of the first MIS transistor T2 is connected to an input electrode 10 . The drain 31 or source 30 , whichever is not connected to the electrode 10 of the first MIS transistor T2 is connected to the gate 1 of the second MIS transistor T1 . Whichever of the source 30 or drain region 31 of the first MIS transistor T2 is connected to the electrode 10 is formed by doping with phosphorus atoms. The other diffusion regions are formed by doping with arsenic atoms. The depth of the source 30 , or drain region 31 of the first MIS transistor T2 is greater than the other diffusion regions. In addition, the source 30 or drain 31 region of the first MIS transistor T2 has a considerable gradient with regard to the concentration of the phosphorous atoms. As a result, the depletion layer between the source 30 or drain 31 region of the first MIS transistor T2 and the semiconductor substrate 4 is broader than that in the other region. Consequently, a high tolerance against abnormal high input voltages is obtained.
