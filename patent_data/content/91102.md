# Color signal processing circuit for video tape recorders.

## Abstract
A color signal processing circuit in a video tape recorder for recording a low frequency converted color signal com prises a voltage controlled oscillator 10 for generating a carrier having a center frequency which is M times as high as a low frequency sub carrier frequency, where M is an integer, detection means 16 for detecting a variation of the oscillation frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator in at least a reproduction mode, suppression means 27, 29 31 for suppressing the change of the oscillation frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator by the output signal from the detection means and counter means 28 for changing the center oscillation frequency of the voltage controlled oscilla tor depending on whether the signal is processed in the NTSC system or the CCIR system such for the suppression range for the change of the oscillation frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator by the suppression means for the NTSC system is equal to or wider than that for the CCIR system. The counter means includes a pulse eliminating frequency divider of a variable frequency division factor.
