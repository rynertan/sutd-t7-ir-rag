# Process for moulding gels usable for thin layers electrophoresis.

## Abstract
A mould for the moulding by casting of thin, cross linked, polymerized resin films is used which is subjected, when being filled with the liquid to be polymerized, to a cen trifugal force field exceeding that of the earth gravitation field, the whole being for equalizing the intimate structure of the polymer and to expel therefrom the bubbles of gas pos sibly present therein.
