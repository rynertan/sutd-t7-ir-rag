## Description
Title A sliding clamp for a binder having flexible binding prongs. The invention relates to a sliding clamp for fastening the binding prongs of a binder having flexible binding prongs, which is adapted to slide in a railshaped member of substantially U shaped cross section, provided with openings for the passage of the binding prongs. Such a sliding clamp is known from US patent 3,080,562. The known binder comprises an approximatelyU shaped rail having two parallel legs linking up with a bottom portion, said legs being inwardly bent at the free edges. The bottom portion contains openings at an interspace corresponding with the distance between the flexible binding prongs, so that the prongs can extend through said bores. Besides, at least one sliding clamp is provided that is adapted to slide between the legs of the U shape and which is fitted with a slot at the end facing the bottom of the U shaped rail. When inserting the sliding clamp, this butts against a binding prong, which is thereby pushed against the bottom of the U shaped rail and which, upon subsequent sliding movement, is received in the slot. A drawback going with the prior art sliding clamp is that it can be easily pulled out of the rail unintentionally. In the past, this drawback was eliminated by providing the sliding clamp adjacent the front portion of the slot with a shorter slot closed at the front by an intermediate piece. The binding prongs can now extend both through the openings in the rail and through the slot in the sliding clamp, while the intermediate piece at the front end of the sliding clamp prevents the same from being pushed out of the rail entirely. A drawback going with these two sliding clamps described is that when they are installed, the binding prong has to be bent by a force acting just beside a supporting point of the prong, viz. the edge of the opening in the rail. The bending of the prongs thus takes place heavily and with the risk that material is stripped off the prongs, so that the prongs are weakened and may break eventually, resulting in seizure of the sliding clamp. Another drawback of the prior art sliding clamps is that these should be capable of sliding lightly in the rail, since it is always necessary for releasing the binding prongs to displace the sliding clamp so that, when the rail has been removed entirely from the prongs, the sliding clamps may fall out of the rail and get lost. It is an object of the invention to eliminate the above drawbacks. To this end according to the invention, a sliding clamp of the above described type is characterized in that the sliding clamp comprises a first elongate portion adapted to slide in the rail shaped member and which is fitted with a passage for a binding prong and a second portion pivotally connected to the first portion, said second portion being adapted for pivotal movement in a pivoting line extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the first portion, and which is provided with cam means for being locked in a position wherein the binding prong is bent and clamped. One embodiment according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a prior art sliding clamp with the associated rail and a binding prong extending through an opening in the rail Fig. 2 is a side view of an embodiment of a sliding clamp according to the invention and Figs. 3 and 4 are top views of portions of the sliding clamp shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 1 shows a prior art sliding clamp 1 adapted to slide between the flanges 2 of a rail shaped member 3.The rail shaped member has an approximately U shaped cross section, while the upright legs of the U shape each have an inwardly bent flange 4. The bottom 5 of the U shape containes a plurality of openings, one of which is shown at 6, through which a flexible binding prong 7 can be inserted. The sliding clamp itself has an elongate, substantially rectangular body 8 adapted to slide with lateral flanges 9 just in the rail shaped member 3. The body 8 is designed in such a manner that in the operating condition a binding prong can lie in a space provided between the bottom of the rail shaped member 3 and the underside of the body 8. The prong is then bent through about 900 in the place where the prong extends through the opening in the bottom of the rail shaped member. At the end of the sliding clamp turned outwardly in the operating condition, there is formed a thickened portion 10, serving as a stop, as a handle and as a suspension member for the binder. At the other end of the sliding clamp, there is provided a slot 11 in registry with the position of the binding prong, said slot being shut off at the front by an intermediate piece 12. In the operating condition, said intermediate piece is located beyond the binding prong and the prong extends partly through the slot 11 over the intermediate piece. Therefore, the sliding clamp cannot be pulled out of the rail without anything more, even if the slot 11 is present above the opening 6. Figs. 2 4 show an embodiment of a sliding clamp according to the invention. Said sliding clamp again comprises a stop 20, likewise functioning as a handle and as a suspension member. From the stop there extends an elongate, frame like portion 21 whose longitudinal ribs are adapted to slide just between the flanges 2 and underneath the flanges 4 of a rail shaped member as shown in Fig. 1.The frame shaped portion is shut off at the stop averted end by a slightly thinner portion 22, over which lies the binding prong 7 in the operating condition indicated by broken lines in Figs. 2 and 3. Furthermore, a recess 23 is formed in the longitudinal ribs of the frame shaped portion on the inside, linking up, with the thinner portion 22, said recess, in the operating condition, extending underneath the flanges 4 of the rail shaped member. Besides, the stop 20 is pivotally connected at 25 to an elongate body 24. In Fig. 3, said elongate body has been omitted for the sake of clarity, but in Fig. 4 it is shown separately. Nevertheless, the elongate body preferably is integral with the frame shaped portion, which can be realized in a simple manner with a synthetic plastics design. The pivoting line indicated at 25 can be formed by reducing the thickness of the material locally. The width B of the elongate body is such that it fits between the longitudinal ribs of the frame shaped portion. The elongate portion is provided at the stopaverted end with a slot 26, thereby forming two legs 27 that are slightly resilient. At the free ends of the legs 27, there are formed laterally projecting cams 28, which correspond with the recesses 23 in the ribs of the frameshaped portion. Moreover, two projections 29 are formed at the top of the resilient legs 27 by means of which lees can be manually pinched slightly towards each other. When the sliding clamp has now been sliding the rail shaped member in such a position that a binding prong extends through the frame shaped portion, while the pivoting elongate member 24 is directed obliquely upwardly, as shown in Fig. 2, the binding prong can be clamped by folding down the elongate member 24, as indicated by an arrow 30 in Fig. 2. The.legs 27 are then manually pinched slightly towards each other by means of the projections 29, so that the cams 28 can pass the flanges 4 and fall in the recesses 23. The binding prong is then gradually bent at a force exerted at a considerable distance from the railshaped member, thus minimizing wear and facilitating the operation.The elongate pivoting portion 24 is also provided with a slot 30 disposed, in operation, at the end facing the rail shaped member, said slot extending into the extension of the slot 26 and being adapted to receive the binding prong in operating condition. The pivoting elongate portion enables to release or to fasten the binding prongs without the necessity of displacing the sliding clamp. As a result, it is only rarely necessary to displace the sliding clamp according to the invention, so that the frame shaped portion can be dimensioned conveniently in such a manner that it slides heavily in the rail shaped member. This has the advantage that even when the rail shaped member has been entirely removed with the sliding clamps from the binding prongs, the sliding clamp cannot fall out of the rail shaped member and get lost. It is observed that various modifications of the embodiment described are obvious to one skilled in the art after the foregoing. For instance, when the sliding clamp is actually so dimensioned that it heavily slides in the rail shaped member, the intermediate piece 22 may be omitted. Such modifications are deemed to fall within the scope of the invention.
