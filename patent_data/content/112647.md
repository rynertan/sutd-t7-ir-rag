# Precision pressure gauge.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a pressure gauge comprising a cylinder 2 means for introducing or communicating 3 with the pressure to be measured with a first end of said cylinder a ram 5 movable axially within said cylinder 2 in re sponse to variations in the pressure to be measured, and pressure measuring means operatively connected with a second end of said ram, 5 characterised in that a sleeve 4 is disposed within said cylinder 2 and about said ram 5 , said sleeve 4 being rotatable about its axis, and by the provision of rotational driving means 6 for rotating said sleeve, 4 and in that the pressure measuring means is a preci sion electronic weight measuring instrument 7 having re ceiver 24 means to which the second end of said ram is operatively connected.
