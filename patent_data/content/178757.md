# SOLAR ARRAY REGULATOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for regulating the voltage output of a solar cell array by selectively actuating individual cells that have been constructed to include a light control valve capable of being rendered opaque or transparent under electrical control. By automatically controlling selected cells in the array in this manner, the output characteristics of the array can be regulated to compensate for variations caused by temperature or other changes.
