# Free piston regenerative hydraulic engine.

## Abstract
A free piston regenerative hydraulic engine includes a displacer piston 22 driven pneumatically by a high pressure or low pressure gas. Actuation of the displacer piston circu lates working fluid through a heater 12 , a regenerator 10 and a cooler 14 . An inertial mass such as a piston 32 or a hydraulic fluid column effectively stores and supplies energy during portions of the cycle. Power is transmitted from the working fluid to a hydraulic fluid across a diaphragm 50 or lightweight piston to achieve a hydraulic power output. The displacer piston may be driven pneumatically, hydraulically or electromagnetically. The displacer piston and the inertial mass may be positioned on the same side of the diaphragm member or may be separated by the diaphragm member.
