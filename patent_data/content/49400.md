# Method of smoothing an insulating layer formed on a semiconductor body.

## Abstract
A method for producing a semiconductor device has the steps of forming an insulating film 4 on an uneven surface of a semiconductor body and dry etching the insulating film 4 by using as an etchant a gas containing carbon halogen bonds and hydrogen, whereby the surface of said insulating film 4 is smoothed.
