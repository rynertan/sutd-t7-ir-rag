# Liquid developer for electrostatic latent image.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a liquid developer for electrostatic latent image, comprising the following com ponents a , b and c which are dispersed in an electrical resistive aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent a a non gel copolymer which as a whole is insoluble in the solvent and which consists essentially of a copolymer segment soluble in the solvent and a polymer segment in soluble in the solvent, the solvent soluble copolymer segment containing as main monomer components an alkyl acrylate or an alkyl methacrylate and a cycloalkyl acrylate or a cycloalkyl methacrylate and or an aralkyl acrylate or an aralkyl meth acrylate, and the solvent insoluble polymer segment con taining vinyl acetate as a main monomer component b a coloring agent and c a dispersant. The liquid developer for electrostatic latent image of the present invention does not change in print density and is used effectively in electrophotography, for example, in wet copiers and printers, and in electrostatography, for example, in fac simile and electrostatic plotters. Particularly, it is suitable for multicolor printing.
