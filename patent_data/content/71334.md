## Description
This invention relates to measuring devices. More particularly, the invention relates to devices which, when used to trace out a path, provide a measure of the length of the path. One particular use of such a device is for measuring the length of a path between two points on a map, or plan or the like. Conventionally such devices comprise a wheel which is placed in contact with the surface on which the path lies and is thereby caused to rotate as the device traces out the path, the wheel being coupled by gearing to a pointer which moves across a scale by an amount corresponding to the length of the path. Such comventional devices suffer from the disadvantage that the axis of rotation of the wheel needs to be maintained at right angles to the direction of travel of the device in operation so that measurement of tortuous paths is quite difficult It is an object of the present invention to provide a device for measuring the length of a path wherein this difficulty is overcome. According to the present invention there is provided a device for measuring the length of a path comprising means for dispensing a marking agent as the device traces out said path, and means for monitoring the dispensed marking agent. The marking agent may, for example, be a liquid, electric charge or magnetic field. In one particular device in accordance with the invention the quantity of marking agent dispensed bears a predetermined relation toXhe distance travelled by the device, and said monitoring means monitors the quantity of marking agent dispensed. In another particular device in accordance with the invention the marking agent is deposited on a surface as it is dispensed and the monitoring means monitors the deposited marking agent. In such a device the marking agent is preferably deposited at a first location in the device and the deposited marking agent is monitored at a second location coaxially surrounding the first location. In one such device, as the marking agent is deposited a property of the deposited marking agent is changed with the distance travelled by the device in predetermined manner, and the monitoring means monitors the change in said property of the deposited marking agent. In a preferred form of such a device, said property of the deposited marking agent changes each time the device has travelled a predetermined distance, and the monitoring means counts the number of said changes. In a further preferred form of such a device the marking agent is deposited at a first location in the device and said property of the deposited marking agent is detected at a second location in the device at said predetermined distance from the first location, and the property of the marking agent deposited at said first location is changed in response to the detection of a change in the property of the deposited marking agent at said second location. The surface on which the marking agent is deposited may be the actual surface on which the path to be measured lies. However, where the surface on which the path lies is not a suitable surface for deposition of the marking agent, or where the marking agent is a liquid and it is desired not to deface that surface, a sheet of transparent material with suitable properties may be laid over the surface on which the path to be measured lies. Alternatively, the device may include a sphere having a surface with suitable properties on which the measuring agent is deposited as the device traces the path to be measured, the sphere being mounted for rotation about its centre by contact with the surface on which the path lies as the device traces out the path. One device in accordance with the invention, and several modifications thereof, will now be described, by way ot example oniy, witn reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating the basic form of the device Figure 2 illustrates a preferred form of one feature of the device of Figure 1 and Figure 3 illustrates a modification of the device of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, the device comprises a marker 1 which deposits a marking agent on a surface S as the device is moved across the surface. If the relation between the dispensation of marking agent and the distance travelled by the device is known, then the distance travelled by the device can be measured by monitoring the dispensed marking agent. In one form of the device the marking agent is dispensed from the marker 1 at a rate related to the distance travelled. The distance travelled can then be measured by a measuring device M which measures the quantity of marking agent dispensed. In such an arrangement the marking agent is suitably a liquid or electric charge. The measuring device may be arranged to monitor the quantity of marking agent dispensed by the marker 1 directly or by monitoring the amount of marking agent in a reservoir not shown from which marking agent is supplied to the marker 1. Alternatively and preferably, the measuring device M is associated with a probe 2, as illustrated in Figure 1, which senses the marking agent actually deposited on the surface S. In order to ensure that the probe 2 will accurately follow the path traced by the marker 1 for movement of the marker 1 in any direction over the surface S the probe 2 is suitably of annular form and coaxially surrounds the marker 1, as illustrated in Figure 2, the spacing between the marker 1 and probe 2 being as small as is practicable. In a preferred form of the device the marker 1 deposits an electric charge whose polarity reverses each time the device has moved a predetermined distance. The distance travelled by the device can then be determined by the measuring means M from the number of changes in charge polarity detected by the probe 2. In such an arrangement the marker 1 may be arranged to deposit initially a charge of one polarity.When the device has been moved a distance equal to the spac between the marker 1 and the probe 2, the probe 2 detects t charge deposited by the marker, and instructs the marker 1 to reverse the polarity of the deposited charge. When the device has been moved a further amount equal to the spacing between the marker n and the probe 2, the probe 2 detects t charge of revere polarity and instructs the marker 1 to aE deposit charge of the original polarity and so on. Thus, as the device traces the path to be measured the marker 1 lays down strips of electric charge of alternate polarity each of a length equal to the spacing between the marker 1 and the probe 2.In response to signals from the probe 2 the measuring means M counts the changes in polarity and thus determines the total distance travelled by the device4 In an alternative form of the preferred arrangemer the marker 1 magnetises the surface S instead of deposits electric charge thereon, and the probe 2 detects the polarity of the magnetisation of the surface. Where the path to be measured lies on a surface on which the marking agent cannot easily be deposited, a transparent sheet of appropriate material may be laid over the surface. Referring now to Figure 3, in a modification of ti arrangements described above with reference to Figures 1 ai 2, the marker and probe act on a sphere 4 trapped in a hole which allows universal rotation of the sphere about its ceiIn use the sphere contacts the surface S so that the sphere rotates as the path to be measured is traced by the deviceThe marker 1 deposits marking agent on the surface of the sphere and the probe 2 detects the deposited marking agent thereby to measure the distance travelled by the device as described above. It will be appreciated that the sphere is fabricated so as to have a surface with suitable properties for the deposition of the marking agent thereby enabling the measurement of paths on any surface, whether or not it has suitable properites for the deposition of the marking agent.
