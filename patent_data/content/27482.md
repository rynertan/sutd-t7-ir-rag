Compounds of Formula II can be prepared as shown in Equation 1. Equation 1EMI8.1 N Pyridinylsulfonyl carbonimidodithioic acids, dialkyl esters of Formula II, can be conveniently prepared by the reaction of an appropriate pyridinesulfonamide, carbon disulfide, an alkali metal hydroxide and an alkyl halide in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide at ambient temperature. Good yields can be obtained if alkali metal hydroxide and carbon disulfide are added in portions to the solution of pyridinesulfonamide.The reaction is generally exothermic and the desired product can be isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into cold water and filtering off the precipitated solid. Generally, the reaction temperature is between 15 and 40 C, preferably 0 and 1000C. Ambient pressure is preferred. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared as shown in Equation 2. Equation 2EMI9.1 This reaction is best carried out in inert aprotic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, N,Ndimethylformamide, or dimethylacetamide at ambient temperature. The anion of aminopyrimidine or aminotriazine can be prepared by the reaction of an alkali metal hydride and an appropriate amine III.It is often convenient to add the compounds ofFormula II to a stirred solution of the anion species at ambient temperature. Addition of water and adjustment of the pH to above 3 with HC1, followed by filtration yields the compounds ofFormula I. Compounds of Formula I may. be converted into their acid addition salts by reaction with agriculturally suitable acids. The following example further illustrates the preparation of intermediates of Formula II these compounds likewise can form acid addition salts. Example 1 N 3 Pyridinylsulfonyl carbonimidodithioic acid, dimethyl ester To a stirred solution of 15.8 g of pyridinesulfonamide in 70 ml of N,N dimethylformamide was added 6.6 g of powdered potassium hydroxide. The mixture was stirred for 50 minutes at room temperature and 3 ml of carbon disulfide was added dropwise.The solution was then stirred at room temperature for one hour, with two portions of 3.3 g of powdered potassium hydroxide and 1.5 ml of carbondisulfide added at half hour intervals. After an additional 0.5 hour of stirring, the mixture was cooled to 0 50C, and 13 ml of iodomethane was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight, poured onto 250 g of ice water and the precipitate was filtered off. It was washed with water until neutral and then dried at reduced pressure to give 17 g of the desired product, rn.p. 115 1180C. By using a procedure of Example 1 with the.appropriate sulfonamide, the following compounds ofTable I can be prepared.

pellets, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of them can be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are used primarily as concentrates which are to be diluted prior to ultimate use. The formu lations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the approximate proportions set forth in Table IV.

Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can be present, depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation, or by tank mixing. Some typical solid diluents are described inWatkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts.Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described inMarsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Ed., Interscience, NewYork, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface ActiveAgents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending, and usually grinding, as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets can be made by spraying the active material on preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, 11Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering,Dec. 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s Chemical Engineer s Handbook , 4th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1963, pp. S S9ff For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H.

Utility The compounds of the present invention possess herbicidal activity and are useful for preparing compounds with herbicidal activity. The herbicides have utility for broad spectrum pre and or postemergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.5 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low .organic matter content or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests.The test procedures and results follow. Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua ,Cassia tora, morningglory Ipomoea spp. , cocklebur . Xanthium spp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat as well as nutsedge tubers were planted in a growth medium and treated pre emergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bush beans with the third trifoliate leaf expanding, crabgrass, barnyardgrass and wild oats with two leaves, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory and cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum and corn with four leaves, soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with three leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with three five leaves were sprayed.Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, whereupon all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment. The ratings are based on a numerical scale extending from 0 no injury, to 10 complete kill. The accompanying descriptive symbols have the following meanings G growth retardation C chlorosis necrosis 6Y abscised buds or flowers S albinism and H formative effects.The ratings for the compounds tested by this procedure are presented in Table A. It will be seen that certain of the compounds tested have utility for selective postemergence weed control in wheat.
