# MULTICOMPONENT GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES HAVING POLYPHOSPHAZENE COATINGS

## Abstract
Multicomponent membranes for gas separation having polyphosphazene coatings in occluding contact with a por ous separation membrane are disclosed which are effective for separating at least one gas from gaseous mixtures and which exhibit improved stability when exposed to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons contained in the gaseous mix tures. In addition multicomponent membranes for gas sep arations having a polyphosphazene coating in occluding contact with a porous separation membrane of polar mater ial are disclosed which exhibit relative preferential permea tion of polar gases from mixtures containing polar and non polar gases.
