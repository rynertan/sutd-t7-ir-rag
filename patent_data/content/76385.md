# Reciprocating engine air intake system.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine has air intake manifold ing proximate two parallel cylinder heads, the heads extend ing longitudinally and being laterally spaced, and a the manifolding includes runner ducts that extend generally laterally and in generally parallel relation, b each runner duct has a discharge end communicat ing with intake valve porting associated with one of the heads, c each runner duct has an intake end spaced generally laterally from its discharge end, the intake ends extending in two parallel rows that extend longitudinally, d and a plenum chamber communicates with the intake ends and via which air is supplied to both of the rows of runner duct intake ports.
