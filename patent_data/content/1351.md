# Improvements in or relating to sodium sulphur cells.

## Abstract
In a sodium sulphur cell, the cathodic reactant comprising sulphur and sodium polysulphides is highly corrosive and of poor electrical conductivity. It is known to put carbon material, e.g. a graphite felt in this reactant to form a conductive path to a metal current collector which must be protected against corrosion in any cell having a long life. The present invention is directed to an improved current collector. Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment in which the current collector comprises an aluminium rod or tube 25 surrounded or partially surrounded by a sheath 26 of a metal, such as a nickel alloy, resistant to corrosive attack. The aluminium rod or tube 25, where it is exposed, becomes coated with an oxide and or sulphide layer which is non conductive. The sheath is welded at 28 through this layer to provide electrical conductivity and may have radially extending fins 27.
