# A chewing gum composition which has an enhanced flavour and sweetness.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a chewing gum composition which contains a sweetener, spherical particle having microporous channels, and a flavouring agent, wherein the flavouring agent is sorbed into the microporous channels of the spherical particles. These channels increase the particles sorptive surface area and permit the particles to adsorb, as well as absorb, nonaqueous liquids such as the flavouring liquid.
