# Silicon aluminium oxynitride ceramic product and method of production.

## Abstract
A silicon aluminium oxynitride product having the crys tal lattice structure of silicon oxynitride but of expanded cell dimensions is produced by sintering a powder mixture of 50 to 65 wt of Si₃N₄, 22 to 35 wt SiO₂, 1 to 20 wt Al₂O₃ and 1 to 15 wt of at least one oxide of Y, Li, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ce or another rare earth element, the molar ratio of SiO₂ to Si₃N₄ being greater than 1 1 and the percentages being based on the total weight of the ingredients. Sintering is effected at 1600 to 1900 C in a non oxidising atmosphere so that the Al₂O₃, said at least one oxide and part of the SiO₂ in the mix ture react to form a liquid phase from which silicon alumin ium oxynitride having an expanded silicon oxynitride crys tal lattice is crystallised. The sintered material is cooled to form a product containing said silicon aluminium oxynitride and at least one grain boundary phase containing silicon and the metal s of said at least one oxide.
