# Athletic socks with integrally knit arch cushion.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to athletic socks which are particularly suitable for jogging and running. In one embodiment, the socks are each formed with a shock absorber cushion pad C in the inner portion 16a of the arch area 16 , formed by knitting a sufficiently greater amount of yarn into the inner arch portion 16a than into the outer portion 16b of the arch area. This is achieved by provid ing a greater density of terry loops in the inner portion 16a of the sock than in the outer portion 16b , thus enhancing the cushioning provided in the inner portion 16a of each sock. The shock absorber cushion pads C protect and cushion the inner portions of the arches of the wearer s feet, and reduce the shock normally imparted to the inner portions of the arches of the feet of the wearer, so that normal articulation of the bones in the feet takes place when the wearer is jogging and running.
