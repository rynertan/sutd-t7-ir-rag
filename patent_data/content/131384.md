## Description
HOIST HOOK SAFETY DEVICEThis invention relates to a safety device for a hoist hook, and more particularly to a safety device for a hoist hook suitable for mounting at the end of a load chain of a hoist and used for lifting or lowering a load.tn general hoists are provided at the end of their load chains with a hook for hooking onto a sling or loop of a rope tied around a load, and a safety lever is pivotally connected to the root of the hook so as to close the throat or opening thereof between the root and the tip of the hook, thereby preventing the sling from escaping from the hook. In more detail, the conventional safety device, as shown in Fig. 5, has a lever L pivotally connected to the root of the hook F and resiliently biased by a spring S toward the tip of the hook F counterclockwise in Fig. 5 so that the free end of the lever L abuts against the inner surface of the distal end of the hook F to close the throat W thereof, thereby preventing a sling A of, for example, a load engag ing rope from escaping from the hook F through said throatW. In such safety device, the sling A, when pulled downwardlyBy the weight of the load and resting at the bottom of the jaw of the hook F as shown by the solid line in Fig. 5, cannot escape from the hook F. In the case where the rope is not loaded and becomes slack, for example. when the load is downed on the ground, the sling A may, though, as shown by the phantom line in Fig. 5 rise up and pass around the lever L beyond the tip of the hook F. In such a condition, the sling A may, when the rope is subsequently loaded again push the levers open and then escape through the open throat of the hook F, from said hook F. Also the hook F is opened at its throat W by swinging of the lever L towards the root of hook F as shown by the phantom line in Fig. 5 so that the width of the throat W. when open, is restricted by an amount corresponding to the thickness of the lever L and the permissible diameter of the sling A is restricted in order to avoid interference with the swinging of the lever L. Furthermore, when an operative intends to remove the sling A from the hook F, he has to swing the lever L with one hand towards the root of hook F against the force of the spring S, and while holding the lever L in the open condition, has to then remove the sling A with his other hand, whereby removal of the sling A becomes very troublesome and time consuming.It is an object of the present invention to avoid or minimize one or more of the above disadvantages.According to the present invention the hook safety device is provided with a lever which is pivotally connected to the root of the hook, closes the throat of the hook, and has a stop means formed and arranged for abutment with the outside tip of the hook to restrain the lever against swinging inwardly of the hook a first biasing means for biasing the lever in the direction of opening the throat a swinging member which has a first engagement portion engageable with the inner surface at the distal end of the hook and a second engagement portion engageable with the lever and is pivotally connected to the lever at a position inwardly, with respect to the hook, of a straight line connecting the pivot point of the lever to the hook and the stop means of the lever and a second biasing means for biasing the swinging member in the direction of engagement of the second engagement portion with the lever, so that the first engagement portion is disposed outwardly, with respect to the hook, of a straight line connecting the pivot point of the lever with that of the swinging member and engages the inner surface of the distal end of the hook thereby to prevent the lever from swinging to..npen the throat, and the swinging member is operable from the exterior to move the first engagement portion outwardly of the hook thereby to set free the lever in the direction of opening the throat of the hook.Thus the present invention provides hoist hook having a.neck, a nose generally opposite thereto with a throat opening therebetween, a lever pivotally connected to the neck of said hook for closing said opening and having a stop means formed and arranged for abutment with the outer surface of the nose of said hook for restraining said lever against swinging inwardly of said hook, a first resilient biasing means formed and arranged for biasing said lever away from said nose towards an open position leaving said throat open, a locking member provided with a first engagement portion engageable with the inner surface of the nose of said hook and a second engagement portion engageable with said lever and pivotally connected to said lever and at a position inward, relative to the hook interior, of a straight line connecting the pivot point of said lever on said hook and the stop means of said lever, and a second resilient biasing means having a biasing force weaker than that of said first resilient biasing means and formed and arranged for biasing said locking member in a direction for engagement of said second engagement portion with said lever, so that when said second engagement portion engages said lever, said first engagement portion of said locking member is disposed outwardly, relative to the hook interior, of a straight liner inter connecting the pivot point of said lever and the pivot point of said locking member so that in its locking position said first engagement portion engages the inner surface of the nose of said hook to restrain said lever against swinging towards its open position and said locking member is operable for unlocking from outside so as to.withdraw the first engagement portion of said locking imember away from said hook nose, whereby said lever is made freely pivotable in the direction towards its open position for opening of said hook throat.In the hoist hook of the invention the locking member is operated from outside to swing the lever outwardly from the hook so as to open the throat of the hook, in other words, the throat is not opened by movement of the lever inwardly of the hook. Hence, even when the rope slackens and the sling moves around the outside of the lever, there is no danger of the lever unintentionally opening the throat.Accordingly escape of the sling from the hook is reliably prevented thereby improving safety. Furthermore, the throat of the hook is opened by swinging the lever outwardly of the hook under the influence of the spring force of the first biasing means, so that it is easy to remove the sling from the hook. Also the throat opens to a maximum thereby enabling the use of load engaging ropes of larger diameter. Further preferred features and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description given by way of example of a preferred embodiment illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a partly sectioned front elevation of a hook safety device of the invention Fig. 2 is a partially cutaway side elevation of the device of Fig. lit Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a lever of the device ofFig. 1 to which a swinging member is pivotally connected andFig. 4 is a partial view corresponding generally to Fig. 1 illustrating the mode of operation of the lever andFig. 5 is an elevation of one example of a conventional safety device.In the drawings is shown a hook 1 rotatably supported via a bearing D on a block B connected to the load end of a chainC of a hoist not shown . The hook has a neck 11 and a nose 12, with a throat or opening 10 therebetween, through which a sling or loop of a load engaging rope to be hoisted enters the hook 1.A safety device is provided on the hook 1 in accordance with the present invention and comprises a lever 2 pivotally connected to the neck 11 of the hook 1 and a locking member 3 pivotally connected in turn, to the lever 2.The lever 2, as shown,in Fig. 2, comprises a pair of opposed side walls 21 and 22 at a predetermined spacing larger than the width of the nose 12 of the hook 1, and a top wall 23 inter connecting the side walls 21 and 22. the side walls ill and 22 being wider at their free end portions and covering both sides of the nose 12 of the hook 1 thereby to resist a lateral lbad acting on the lever 2. The top wall 23 provides at its distal end a stop means 24 for abutment with the outer surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1 so as to prevent the lever 2 from swinging substantially inwardly of the hook 1 although, as will be further explained hereinbelow, and as may be seen in Figs. 1 and 4 in the locked condition of the safety device the stop means 24 is spaced from hook nose 12.Also, the lever 2 is pivotally connected to the neck 11 of the hook 1 via a pivot shaft 6 mounted in a shaft bore in the neck 11 and in corresponding bores in the side plates 21 and 22 andcaUlkey thereto, and between the lever 2 and the neck 11 is provided a first resilient biasing means 4 which biases the lever 2 in the direction of opening of the throat 10 of the hook 1.The first biasing means 4 is generally in the form of a coil spring with a coiled portion supported around the shaft 6 and one end retained by the top wall 23 of lever 2 and its other end by the neck 11 thereof.The locking member 3 is general U shaped in section and has a width smaller than the spacing between the opposed side plates 21 and 22, so that a first engagement portion 31 thereof which is engageable with the inner surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1, is provided at one end of the locks ing member 3, a second engagement portion 32A engageable with the side edges of side walls 21 and 22 being provided at the other end thereof.Also, the locking member 3 is, as shown, pivotally mounted at a longitudinally intermediate portion thereof across the side walls 21 and 22, and provided at its other end with control lugs 32 projecting at right angles from the side walls of swinging member 3 and providing second engagement portions 32a. Between the locking member 3 and the lever 2 is provided a second resilient biasing means 5. smaller in biasing force than the first biasing means 4, for biasing the locking member 3 in the direction of engagement of the second engagement portions 32a with the lever 2.The second biasing means 5 comprises, as shown in Fig. 3, a pair of springs connected at one end to each other with the coiled portions of the springs interposed between respective ones of the side walls 21 and 22 and the locking member 3 therebetween and supported on the pin 7 , the connecting portion of the springs being disposed at the rear surface of the locking member 3, and each free end of said biasing means 5 retained at the inner surface of the top wall 23 of the lever 2. The biasing force of the second biasing means 5 biases the locking member 3 clockwise as viewed in Fig. 1 whereby the second engagement portions 32a resiliently abut the side edges of respective ones of the side walls 21 and 22.The locking member 3 is pivotally connected to the lever 2 inwardly of the hook 1 beyond the straight line connecting the pivot point 21 of the lever 2 on the neck 11 of the hook 1 and the stop means 24, and the first engagement portion 31 of the locking member 3 is disposed inwardly of the hook 1 but outwardly of the straight line connecting the lever pivot point 21 and the locking member pivot point 02 on the lever 2. Thus, the engagement of the first engagement portion 31 with the inwardly disposed surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1 restrains the lever 2 against swinging away from the nose 12 in the direction of opening of the throat 10.In use of the safety device the lever 2, as shown by the chain line in Fig. 4, is swung out to open the throat 10 so that the sling A of the load engaging rope can be hooked by the hook 1, whereupon the lever 2 is swung back to close the throat 10 at the hook 1.In more detail, the lever 2 is swung first clockwise as viewed in Fig. 1 manually against the spring force of the first biasing means 4, whereupon the locking member 3 engages with its first engagement portion 31 the tip of the nose 12 of the hook 1, the locking member 3 then being swung counterclockwise against the spring force of the second biasing means 5 as it rides over the inward surface of the nose 12. The lever 2 continues to move inwardly of the hook until the stop means 24 engages the tip of the hook hose 12 at which point the first engagement portion 31 of the locking member 3 disengages from the nose 12 of the hook 1 so that the locking member 3 can swing back clockwise under the influence of the spring force of the second biasing means 5 to engage the side edges of lever 2 with the second engagement portion 32a.In this state, when the lever 2 is released from manual control, it tends to return towards its open position beyond the hook throat, under the influence of the spring force of the first biasing means 4, the stop means 24 disengaging from the hook nose 12 . Since, though the radial separation L between the first engagement portions 31 of the locking member 3 and the pivot point 0l of the lever 2, is greater than the minimum radial separation 1 between the pivot point 01 and the inner surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1 the lever 2 is limited in its return pivotal movement towards its open position by the engagement of the first engagement portion 31 with the inwardly disposed surface of the nose 12.Thus, the lever 2, even when it is subjected to an upwardly directed force by the sling A of the rope hooked by the hook 1, cannot swing outwardly to open the throat 10 because the locking member 3 engages with its first engagement portion 31, the inward surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1.Also, even when the sling A comes round the outside of the lever 2 to push it inwardly, the stop means on the lever is retained on the nose 12 of the hook 1 thereby preventing the lever 2 from swinging inwardly of the hook 1.Hence, the throat 10 of the hook 1 is retained reliably in its closed condition by means of the contact of the stop means 24 with the outside of the nse 12 and the engagement of the first engagement portion 31 of the locking member 3 with the inner surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1.For opening of the hook the locking member 3 is turned counterclockwise as viewed in Fig. 4 in the direction of the arrow manually with the aid of the operating lugs 32 thereon, thereby to disengage the first engagement portion 31 from the inner surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1, whereupon the throat 10 may be opened as described below. Upon swinging the locking member 3 counterclockwise, the first engagement portion 31 moves towards the pivot pointO of the lever 2. As a result, the distance L between the pivot point 0 and the first engagement portion 31 l becomes smaller than the minimum separation 1 between the pivot 01 and the inner surface of the nose 12 of the hook 1, thereby disengaging the first engagement portion 31 from the nose 12. This disengagement allows the lever 2 to swing upwardly under the influence of the spring force of the first biasing means 4 away from the nose 12 towards its open position as shown by the chain line in Fig. 4 leaving the throat 10 open. As will be apparent from the above the safety device of the invention ensures closure of throat 10 by engagement of thesyop means 24 of the lever 2 with the nose 12 of the hook 1 so that the throat 10 cannot be opened unin tentionally even by the sling A of the rope passing round the outside of the lever. thereby preventing escape of the sling A from the h ook 1. Furthermore, the lever 10 is easy to swing in the direction for opening of the throat 10, and the throat 10 can be opened to its maximum width to enable use of the hook with larger diameter rope slings A.
