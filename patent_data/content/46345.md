# Controlled hydrodynamic flow in flow cytometry systems.

## Abstract
Sheath fluid and sample fluid are both provided at respective constant mass flow rates through the flow cell of a flow cytometry system. Sample fluid is provided by means of a precision positive displacement pump utilizing a motor driven screw and syringe system. Sheath fluid is provided either using a similar positive displacement system, or utilizing a pressurized source and a differential pressure regulator in the sheath flow line.
