# INCREASING THE REACTIVITY OF COUPLING OF BLOCK POLYMERS

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for the preparation of thermo plastic block polymers which comprises contacting conjugated diolefinic monomers selected from the group consisting of iso prene, piperylene, 2 ethyl 1,3 butadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene and 1,3 butadiene, and the like, mixed with at least one polyvinyl aromatic coupling compound selected from the group of o, m and p divinylbenzene, 1,2,4 trivinylbenzene, 1,8 divinylnaphthalene, 1,2 divinyl 3,4 dimethylbenzene, 2,4 divinylbiphenyl, 3,5,4 trivinylbiphenyl and 1,3,5 trivinyl benzene under solution polymerization conditions with a poly styryilithium catalyst which has been prepared by reacting an alkyllithium compound with a styrene monomer selected from the group consisting of styrene, alpha methylstyrene, p methylstyrene, p t butylstyrene, 3 methylstyrene, 1 vinyl naphthalene, and the like, in which an amount of polyvinyl aromatic coupling compound ranges fom about 1.0 to about 6 vinyl groups of the polyvinyl aromatic coupling compound per mole of active lithium catalyst used, in which the living block copolymer is treated with A a polar compound selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether glyme , diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diglyme , triethylene glycol dimethyl ether triglyme , tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether tetraglyme , 2,3 dimethoxybutane, N,N,N ,N tetramethyl ethylene diamine TMEDA , tri n butylphosphine and hexa methylphosphoric triamide HMPA , in which the molar ratio of the said polar compounds to the active lithium ranges from about 0.01 1 to about 20 1 or B a polar compound selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, triethylamine, 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO , p dioxane, tri n butylamine and N,N dimethylpiperazine, in which the molar ratio of the said polar compounds to the active lithium ranges from about 0.5 1 to about 100 1.
