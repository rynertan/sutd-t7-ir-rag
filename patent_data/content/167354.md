## Description
This invention relates to a catalyst composition of matter comprising an oxide of a metal selected from a niobium, b mixtures of niobium and tantalum or, c tantalum supported on a titania support wherein at least a portion of the supported metal oxide is in a noncrystalline form. U.S. 4,149,998 to Tauster et al. relates to heterogeneous catalysts consisting of Group VIII metals, dispersed on oxide carriers selected from Ti, V, Nb, Ta and mixtures thereof and zirconium titanate and BaTiO3. However, there is no suggestion in this patent that the niobium, vanadium or tantalum be supported on titania. The usefulness of niobia supported on titania for the reduction of NO with NH3 has been shown bySusumu Okazaki and Tetsuhiro Okuyama in Nb2O5 Supported on TiO2 Catalytic Activity forReduction of NO with NH3 which was published in Bull.Chem. Soc. Jpn., 56, 2159 2160 July, 1983 . In this work, Okazaki et al reacted NO with NH3 in the presence of a niobia on titania catalyst over a temperature regime of from 200 5000C using a conventional flow reactor, with the mixture of NO and NH3 being diluted with air. The catalytic activity of niobia supported on titania for the reduction of NO with NH3 in the presence of air was much higher than the catalytic activity of niobia supported on other supports such as alumina, zirconia, and silica. The present invention concerns a catalyst compositions comprising an oxide of a metal selected from a niobiun, b mixtures of niobium and tantalum or, c tantalum, said metal oxide being supported on titania wherein at least a portion of said supported metal oxide is in a non crystalline form. These catalyst compositions are useful for synthesizing methanethiol, CH3SH and CH4 from mixtures of H2S and CO.Moreover, niobia on titania is known to be a useful catalyst for reducing NO with NH3 in the presence of air. Thus, niobia on tantala is a useful catalyst for removing NO from waste gases. The compositions of this invention are also useful as catalyst supports for supporting iron carbide or ruthenium for FischerTropsch hydrocarbon synthesis reactions. In a preferred embodiment at least about 25 wt. of the supported metal oxide will be in a non crystalline form. As previously stated, the catalyst compositions of the present invention comprise an oxide of a metal selected from a niobium, b mixtures of niobium and tantalum, or c tantalum, the metal oxide being supported on a titania support wherein at least a portion of the supported metal oxide, and preferably at least about 25 wt. thereof, is in a noncrystalline form. In the catalyst composition of this invention, the surface of the titania is modified by the oxide of niobium, mixture of niobium and tantalum or tantalum in an amount such that the modified surface of the so modified titania exhibits properties different from titania whose surface has not been modified and also different from bulk oxides of niobium or tantalum and mixtures of bulk oxides of niobium and tantalum.Consequently, the catalyst compositions exhibit properties different from both unmodified titania and bulk oxides of niobium or tantalum or mixtures of bulk oxides of niobium and tantalum. Thus, the catalysts of this invention comprise titania whose surface has been modified with an oxide of niobium or tantalum or a mixture of niobium and tantalum. That is, the surface of the titania has been modified by the supported oxides in an amount such that the catalyst exhibits properties different from titania whose surface has not been modified and different from bulk oxides of niobium or tantalum and mixture of oxides of niobium and tantalum. Those skilled in the art know that the oxides of niobium, tantalum and mixtures thereof are crystalline in their bulk form. Thus, at least a portion of and preferably at least about 25 wt. of the supported metal oxide will be in a non crystalline form. This will be accomplished if the metal oxide loading on the titania broadly ranges between about 0.5 to 25 wt. of the total catalyst weight. In preparing the catalyst compositions of this invention an oxide or precursor thereof of a metal selected from a niobium, b mixtures of niobium and tantalum, or c tantalum is deposited on the titania to form either the surface modified titania catalyst composition of this invention or, in the case of one or more precursors, a catalyst precursor composite. The precursor composite is then calcined to oxidize the precursor composite to form a catalyst composition of this invention. The catalyst precursor composites of this invention may be prepared by techniques well known in the art, such as incipient wetness, impregnation, etc., the choice being left to the practitioner.When using the impregnation technique, the impregnating solution is contacted with the support material for a time sufficient to deposit the precursor material onto the support either by selective adsorption or alternatively, the excess solvent may be evaporated during drying leaving behind the precursor salt. Advantageously, incipient wetness techniques may also be used. The choice of catalyst preparation is left to the practitioner. The transition metal oxide precursor salt solution used in preparing the catalyst of this invention may be aqueous or organic, the only requirement being that an adequate amount of precursor compound for the selected transition metal oxide be soluble in the solvent used in preparing this solution. The final catalyst composite will then normally be dried at temperatures ranging from about 500 3000C to remove the excess solvent and, if necessary decompose the salt if it is an organic salt. The transition metal oxide precursor is then converted into the oxide form by calcining at temperatures of from about 1500 to 8000C and preferably 3000 7000C in a suitable oxidizing atmosphere such as air, oxygen, etc.The time required to calcine the composite will, of course, depend on the temperature and in general will range from about 0.5 to 7 hours. Reducing atmospheres may also be used to decompose the transition metal oxide precursors, but the resulting composite will then require subsequent calcination to convert the reduced metal component to the oxide form. The catalysts of this invention will generally have metal oxide loadings of from about 0.5 to 25 wt. metal oxide based on the total catalyst composition, preferably from about 1 to 15 wt. , more preferably from about 2 10 wt. based on the total catalyst composition. The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following Example.Experimental Hydrogen sulfide was obtained in compressed cylinders from Scientific Gas Products electronic grade 99.999 purity , while carbon monoxide was purchased from Matheson Gas 99.99 purity . The above gases were checked for absence of hydrocarbon impurities MS analysis and G.C. analysis with FID detector and used without further purification. Helium 99.99 , when used as an inert carrier gas, was predried in a molecular sieve trap, scrubbed for 2 removal in a hot Cu trap, and redried in a molecular sieve trap. Gas flows were regulated with Tylan F 260 flow controllers and premixed in a gas manifold system prior to entering into the catalyst bed. A quartz reactor tube of 9 mm ID by 700 mm was loaded with 2.5 gram samples of 40 60 mesh Tyler catalyst particles which were supported on each end with degreased quartz wool plugs. An external thermocouple was attached to the outside of the quartz tube near the center of the catalyst bed to record reaction temperature. The tube was heated with a three zone electric furnace ATS 3210 equipped with Omega set point controllers. Product analysis was accomplished with an on line Carle GC series SX equipped with a hydrogen transfer system and FID TC detectors. Gas phase samples were also separated on a Perk in Elmer 900 GC coupled to a DuPont 21 491 mass spectrometer for product identification of CH3SH and CH3SCH3. Response factors for quantitative G.C. analysis were obtained from a primary standard mixture of gases with quantities similar to the product mixture.Catalyst Preparation Degussa P 25, a mixture of anatase and rutile titania, was used as the titania support. All of the catalysts were prepared in a glove box in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent decomposition of the transition metal oxide precursors. In all cases 10 grams of theP 25 titania powder were slurried in 100 cc of ethanol to which was added the transition metal oxide precursor, with the resulting mixture stirred overnight, under flowing nitrogen, to evaporate the ethanol. Each dry mixture was then taken out of the glove box and 3 cc of water added. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight in air, then the dry powder placed in a quartz boat and slowly heated in a 1 1 flowing mixture of 2 in He up to 400oC. At 4000C the He flow was cut off and the powdered catalyst precursor then heated from 400 to 5750C in 100 02.Each sample of catalyst precursor was held at 5750C in the 2 for two hours to calcine the precursor into a catalyst of this invention. The transition metal oxide precursors were obtained from Alfa, Inc. and were Nb C2H50 5, and Ta C2H50 5. The amounts of niobia and tantala precursors added to each slurry of 10 g P 25 in 100 cc of ethanol were 2.5 and 1.84 grams, respectively. The resulting catalysts contained 10 wt. niobia on titania and 10 wt. tantala on titania. The niobia and tantala contents of the catalysts are expressed as niobium pentoxide and tantalum pentoxide. In this experiment a 2 gram sample of each catalyst was charged to the reactor which was then heated up to a temperature of 2000C in flowing helium.After the reactor achieved a temperature of 2000C, a 1 1 molar mixture of H2S CO feed at a flow rate of about 4 cc min. was introduced to the reactor. The reactor was then held at isothermal conditions bin order to establish steady state conditions with respect to feed conversion and product selectivity. The temperaure was then raised at 500C intervals and held at each temperature for one hour to measure activity and selectivity. The final temperature reached was 4000C. The reactor was then cooled to 3000C to recheck the activity compared to the activity during the heating step. The results are shown in the Table and clearly demonstrate that the catalysts were effective for the conversion of the H2S CO feed.
