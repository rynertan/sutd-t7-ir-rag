# Method of melting a thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed of melting thermoplastic material, such as glass, in a refractory vessel 24 , while protecting the refractory walls 26, 28 against corrosion and protecting the material from contamination by such corrosion. This is achieved by providing at least the sidewalls 26 of the refractory vessel 24 with an oxidizable metal liner 30, 30B , for example of molybdenum, the liner 30, 30B being spaced away from but in close proximity to the sidewalls 26 to form an annular space 32 .
