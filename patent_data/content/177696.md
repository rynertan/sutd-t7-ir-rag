## Description
MACROLIDE ALXYLATION PROCESSTechnical Field This invention relates to a new synthetic process for the preparation of O alkylated macrolide antibiotics. In particular, it relates to the preparation of alkylated erythromycin derivatives.Background Art O alkylated derivatives of erythromycin and closely related antibiotics such as oleandomycin are known which have been stated to have a desirable combination of enhanced acid stability and improved antibacterial activity versus the present erythromycin compound. For example, U. S. Patent 4,331,803, issuedMay 25, 1982, to Watanabe et al. and assigned to TaishoPharmaceutical Co. Ltd., describes 6 O methyl erythromycin A derivatives which are stated to have improved antibiotic activity in comparison to erythromycin. However, the process described in the 803 patent for the preparation of those compounds involved protection of the 2 O and the 3 dimethylamino positions. That was done by adding carbobenzoxy groups at those positions, removing one of the methyl groups on the amino function in the process.Following nonselective O methylation of the compound, the carbobenzoxy protecting groups were removed and the methyl group was reintroduced. That synthetic process is long and difficult, and results in low overall yields. As a result, faster, more efficient processes with high yields and higher purity are still sought for economical production of O alKyl√Öated macrolides. Disclosure of the Invention This invention provides a shorter and much less expensive route to the preparation of O alkylated macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, than is taught in the art. The overall yields are higher, the purity is improved, and the synthetic process can be extended to new alkylated macrolides, as well as those taught in the art. This invention is based on the discovery that protection of the most reactive hydroxyl group the 2 hydroxyl in the cases of erythromycin, oleandomycin, and derivatives thereof by simple esterification provides adequate protection of the adjacent dimethylamine group, and prevents quaternization of that amine when subsequent O alkylation is carried out at one or more of the remaining hydroxyl groups. As a result, the deprotection and re methylation steps are avoided. The ester can be removed later, if desired, by simple hydrolysis. In general, this invention provides a process for O alkylation of a macrolide antibiotic having a plurality of reactive hydroxyl groups, at positions other than the most reactive hydroxyl group, comprising esterifying the most reactive hydroxyl group, followed by alkylating one or more of the remaining hydroxyl groups. In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides a method for producing 6 0 , 11 0 and 6,11 di 0 alkylated erythromycin derivatives comprising esterifying the 2 hydroxyl group with an acylating agent selected from compounds of the formulas EMI2.1 where Y is halogen, such as fluoride, chloride or bromide R is divalent alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, cycloalkyl or heterocyclic alkyl of 1 to 22 carbon atoms, or alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or alkaryl of 3 to 18 carbon atoms and X is hydrogen or a terminal acyl group of the formula EMI3.1 where R is monovalent alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms and 2B R2 C 20 wherein R2is monovalent alkyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or heterocyclic alkyl of 1 to 22 carbon atoms, alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl or alkaryl of 3 to 13 carbon atoms, followed by O alkylation with an alkyl halide in the presence of a strong base. The term alkyl of 1 to 22 carbon atoms N implies esterification with, for example, the C1 toC22 fatty acids and diacids, such as acetic propionic valeric, caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, malonic sebacic, azelaic, suberic, and succinic acids, as well as the methyl, ethyl and propyl monoesters of the latter dicarboxylic acids. The term cycloalkyl includes, for example, 4 cyclohexyl, 6 cyclopropyl and 2 norbornyl hexadecyl groups. The term heterocyclic alkyl includes, for example, the morpholino, piperidino, piperazino, epoxy and dioxol groups. The term 1alkenyl of 3 to 18 carbon atoms implies esterification with, for example, 2 propenoic, sorbic, palmitoleicr maleic, fumaric, oleic and myristoleic acids.The term thydroxyalkyl of 1 to 22 carbon atoms includes esterification with common hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as lactic, lactobionic, ascorbic, gluconic, malic, tartaric and tartronic acids. In general, the esterification of the macrolide can be accomplished by using any of the variety of techniques and reagents described in the literature, including H. W. Murphy, Antibiot. Annu., 1953 1954, 500 1954 V. C. Stephens, id., 514 1954 R. V. Clark andE. L. Varnes, Antibiot. Chemother., 7, 487 1957 V. C.Stephens and J. W. Corrine, Antibiot. Annu., 1958 1959, 346 1959 , and U.S. 4,069,379 issued January 17, 1978 to Sciavolino, the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. These techniques can be applied to esterify the most reactive hydroxyl group with the preferred esterifying groups of this invention, which are saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and dicarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acid esters of fro 3 to 12 carbon atoms. Most preferred esterifying groups are short chain C1 to C6 aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as succinic acid and C1 to C3 monoesters thereof. Following esterification of the most reactive hydroxyl group, the macrolide esters are alkylated at one or ore of the remaining hydroxyl groups by any convenient alkylation reaction. Any of the macrolideO alkylation techniques disclosed in the literature can be used. One such technique involves the use of an alkyl halide with a strong base such as an alkali metal hydride. Among the alkali metal hydrides useful in this invention are sodium hydride and potassium hydride. A preferred alkali metal hydride is sodium hydride. Other preferred bases include sodium dimsyl, sodium silazide and lithium silazide. Alkyl halides include the alkyl chlorides, bromides and iodides. A preferred halide is the iodide, because of its relatively higher reactivity rate as a leaving group in the alkylation reaction.Alkyl sulfonates, methane sulfonates and fluoromethane sulfonates can also be used. The alkyl moiety can be aC1 to C6 straight or branched chain alkyl group, preferably a C1 to C3 n alkyl, and is most preferably a methyl group. As stated, no protection of the tertiary amino group is necessary in this reaction step. In a preferred embodiment, this process involves alkylation of the 6 O , or 11 O position, or both positions, of erythromycin. Depending upon conditions, S O alkylated, ll 0 alkylated, and 6,11 di O alkylated erythromycin derivatives can be prepared. A number of the resulting alkylated macrolide ester compounds have antimicrobial activity per se and can be used as such. Alternatively, the compounds can be used as intermediates for further reaction to yield derivatives of the 6 O alkylated, ll 0 alkylated and 6,11 di O alkylated macrolide esters. Finally, the ester group can be removed by hydrolysis when subsequent processing conditions do not require further protection of the OH group or the adjacent amine, to yield 6 O alkylated 11 O alkylated, and 6,11 di O alkylated macrolide compounds, and derivatives thereof. This reaction process can be illustrated further by refeLe.ce to the following non limiting examples Example I Reaction of 2 Acetylerythromycin A With Sodium Hydride Methyl Iodide A solution of 5.00 g 6.45 mmol of 2 acetyl erythromycin A in a mixture of 18 ml day dimethylsulfoxide DMSO and 54 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran THF was cooled while stirring in a refrigerated methanol bath at 270 C. 3.8 ml 61.0 mmol of methyl iodide was added to the stirred, partially crystallized mixture, followed immediately by 0.387 g 8.06 mmol of sodium hydride 50 dispersion in mineral oil .After 3 hours 17 ml 121.5 mmol of triethylamine TEA was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath to destroy excess methyl iodide. The reaction mixture was then poured into 300 ml of toluene. The toluene mixture was washed with two 100 ml portions of 4 sodium bicarbonate solution. The toluene layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness using a rotary evaporator to yield a glass. The resulting glass was dried in vacuo overnight to yield 3.76 g of crude product which was found to be a mixture of polar and nonpolar components by thin layer chromatography.A 3.14 g portion of this mixture was resolved by chromatography on a 200 g column 3.0 x 60 cm of Silica Gel 60 70 230 mesh ASTM, E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany prepared in acetonitrile and then equilibrated with the eluent CHC13 25 CH3CN 0.58 concentrated NH4OH. The column was run at a flow rate of 2.6 ml minute and fractions were cut at 9 minute intervals. On the basis of thin layer chromatographic results, appropriate fractions were combined and the solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator. Fractions 31 43 provided 1.14 g of the less polar component which by H nmr proved to be a 3 1 mixture of 6 0 and 6,11 di O methylated products.The mixture was crystallized twice from methanol 250C to yield 2 acetyl 6 O methylerythromycin A as needles mp. 259 264C C.

Example III Reaction of 2 ethylsuccinylerythromycin A With Sodium Hydride Methyl Iodide A 5.00 g 5.80 mmol sample of 2 ethylsuccinylerythromycin A was O methylated in a manner identical to Example I. The crude product mixture 3.68 g was chromatograpned according to the procedure of Example I. Upon evaporation of the eluent, fractions 27 44 provided 1.09 g of the less polar component which was crystallized from benzene heptane to give 2 ethylsuccinyl 6 O methylerythromycin A as needles mp. 215 2200 C. Anal calcd for C44H77N016 876.101 C, 60.32 H, 8.86 N, 1.60. Found C, 60.63 a, 8.86 N, 1.35. On evaporation of the solvent, fractions 54 90 gave 1.11 g of the more polar component which could not be crystallized. The material was dissolved in 40 ml of acetonitrile and treated with 0.5 g of charcoal.The charcoal was removed by filtration on Whatman No. 42 paper and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was triturated with heptane and the solid 2 ethylsuccinyl ll O methylerythromycin was isolated as a mixture of 9 keto and 6,9 hemiketal forms. Anal calcd for C44H77N016 876.101 C, 60.32 H, 8.86 N, 1.60. Found C, 60.10 , 8.85 N, 1.60. Example IV As in Example II if larger quantities of sodium hydride are used then 2 ethylsuccinyl 6,11 di O methylerythromycin A can be isolated from the non polar column fractions by crystallization from acetonitrile. Example V Alkylation of 2 acetyl erythromycin A with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 3.1 g 4 mmol 2 acetylerythromycin A was dissolved in 25 ml dry THF with 7 ml DMSO at 130C. The solution was cooled and stirred while 0.20 g 5 mmol 608 sodium hydride dispersion in mineral oil was added.Evolution of hydrogen gas was observed and followed using a bubbler until after about 1 hour, gas evolution ceased. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of a sample indicated no decomposition of the intermediate. Upon addition of 0.565 ml 5 mmol methyl triflouromethane sulfonate, the reaction mixture became exothermic and warmed spontaneously to OOC. Two ml of TEA were added and the mixture was permitted to warm to 50C. The reaction mixture was extraced with 200 ml of a 1 1 2 mixture of water, brine and toluene. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase was re extracted with a mixture of 50 ml hexane and 70 ml toluene. The combined organic portions were washed with two 50 ml aliquots of water and four 50 ml aliquots of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered and dried in vacuo to yield 2.44 grams of a friable foam which was identified by thin layer chromatography as a mixture of 6 0 and ll 0 methylated materials. Example VI The 2 acetyl 6 O methylerythromycin A ofExample I can be dissolved in methanol, and will spontaneously hydrolyze to 6 O methylerythro,mycin A over to days storage at room temperature.
