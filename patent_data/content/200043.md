# Stabilized natural pigment complexes.

## Abstract
Processes for the preparation of natural pigment com plexes which have improved stability against oxygen, heat, light and moisture and which are soluble in aqueous media at acidic pH conditions are disclosed. The pigment com plexes produced by these processes are also disclosed.
