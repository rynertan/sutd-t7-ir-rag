In this invention, the term salinomycins means each compound, or any mixture of at least two compounds, selected from the group SY 7, SY 8 consisting of salinomycin, SY l, SY 2, SY 3, SY 4, SY 5, SY 6 and the like. The present inventors already found that salinomycin, SY l and SY 2 were produced in the culture of Streptomyces albus waxman and henrich No.80614 strain FESI P. No.419 , and succeeded in isolating the antibiotics from the culture British Patent No.1378414,Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 86191 1976 andJapanese Patent Application No. 5762 1977 . The inventors continued the study and found that, when the above strain is cultured in a medium containing fatty acid or its precursor, it produces salinomycin, SY l, and SY 2 in high yield, and also produces new compounds such as SY 3, SY 4, SY 5, SY 6,SY 7 and SY 8. As described in said literatures, these are produced by culturing an antibiotic producing microorganism belonging to the genus of Streptomyces. However, the yield of each antibiotic produced by such known method is not always satisfactory.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing polyether type antibiotics in remarkably high yields with industrial advantages. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing Salinomycin type antibiotics such as salinomycin, 4 methylsalinomycin, SY 1, SY 2, SY 3, SY 4,SY 5, SY 6, SY 7 and SY 8 substances in high yield. The foregoing and other objects of the present invention have been attained by culturing a polyether type antibioticproducing microorganism in a medium containing a fatty acid or its precursor and ammonia or an ammonium salt or urea.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the special feature of the present invention, salinomycin type antibiotics such as salinomycin, 4 methylsalinomycin,SY 1, SY 2, SY 3, SY 4, SY 5, SY 6, SY 7 and SY 8 substances are produced by culturing a salinomycin type antibiotic producing microorganism in a medium containing a fatty acid or its precursor and ammonia or an ammonium salt or urea. The fatty acids used in the present invention are saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, caproic acid, capric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, methacrylic acid, undecylic acid, and particularly linolic acid, linolenic acid or oleic acid being preferable. The precursor of fatty acid means a substance that is capable of giving said fatty acid outside or inside the microorganism cell , such as monodi or triglycerides of fatty acid, esters of fatty acid or salts of fatty acid. Further, there can be used soy bean oil, safflower oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil olive oil, rape oil, peanut oil, maize oil corn oil , sunflower oil and like vegetable oils, cod oil and like fish oils and lard and like animal fat and oils, which contain said precursors. esters withThe esters of fatty acid can be Cl Cl8 alcohols of said fatty acid.The salts of fatty acid can be ammonium salt and alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of said fatty acid. The addition amount is generally about 1 25 , particularly about 12 20 based on the medium. Ammonia is used in gaseous form or in the form of an aqueous solution. As ammonium salt there are used ammonium salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid or organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, higher fatty acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, hydrogentartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid and malic acid. The addition amount is generally about 0.1 1.0 particularly about 0.3 0.5 based on the medium. As for the time for addition of these additives, addition is effective so long as production of potency of the addition polyether type antibiotic continues, and is conducted at any time either before or after beginning of cultivation.Although the cultivation conditions of the present invention can be selected in accordance with the methods described in said known literatures, excepting that fatty acid or its precursor is used as major carbon source and that ammonia or ammonium salt is used as essential component of the medium, it is possible to raise the production efficiency by varying the conditions depending on the kind of antibiotics. The microorganismsused in the present invention include generally polyether type antibiotics producing strains belonging to the genus of Streptomyces as well as the strains described in said literatures and their natural or artificial mutants. Separation and purification of the products can be carried out in accordance with known methods. Since the objective substance is often contained mainly in the solid portion containing the cells when the production amount of the objective substance is abundant, it is desirable to vary the extraction step properly in order to heighten the recovery percentage of the objective substance from the solid portion. It is possible to use the objective compound in the state that it is contained in the solid portion depending on the use purposes, without separating the objective substance from the solid portion. According to the present invention the production amount of polyether type antibiotics, particularlySalinomycin type antibiotics can be remarkably increased. For example, the yield of Salinomycin is generally 100 300 Y ml in known method, whereas the yield is about 10,000 20,000 y ml in the medium containing fatty acid or its precursor, and the yield is further increased to about 50,000 80,000 Y ml when said medium contains further ammonia or ammonium salt. The preferable feature of the present invention to produce salinomycin type antibiotics will be further illustrated. According to the method of this invention, salinomycins mainly occur in the mycelial mass,and it is preferrable to recover salinomycins from the mycelial mass. In addition to salinoycin, SY l, and SY 2, other new compounds, especially SY 3, SY 4, SY 5, SY 6 and the like are obtained from the culture. The strains used in this invention include Streptomyces albusNo.80614 and its mutants artificially or naturally produced, as well as the other Streptomyces strains capable of producing salinomycins.However, some of the salinomycins can occasionally not be detected in the culture, depending on the strain and fermentation conditions. Fermentation conditions employed in this invention can be any one commonly used for culturing Actinomycetes, except that main carbon source should be a fatty acid or its precursor. Maximum production of salinomycins usually occurs after 150 to 260 hours The from the start of fermentation. ratio of each of salinomycins produced sometimes varies depending on the incubation time.Naturally, the composition of medium and fermentation conditions should be decided for each strain and external conditions, so that most desirable results are obtained. Salinomycins can be isolated from the culture medium by utilizing the physico chemical properties of salinomycins. Because salinomycins are structurally related to each other, the known extraction methods for salinomycin and SY l can be applied to the isolation of salinomycins, however, as for salinomycin, because a large portion of salinomycin is contained in mycelial mass, the extraction process is preferrably modified so as to increase the recovery rate of salinomycin. For example, it is preferred to adjust the whole fermentation broth to PH 2.0 6.0 to precipitate salinomycin, and then to extract the mycelial mass together with the precipitate thus formed with an organic solvent. Among the preferred solvents are acetone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, nhexane, chloroform and the like.After applying the solution to the absorptive materials suitable for the absorption of salinomycins, the srtlinomycins are eluted by a suitable solvent system. he effluent is collected in 2 5 fractions according to the purpo e. Separation and purification of salinomycins are effected by tho procedures utilizing the difference between the properties of desir i compound and imprities. Chromatograpy, solvent extraction and the like are repeated for each fraction to give salino.nycin, SY l, SY 2, SY 3, SY 4, SY 5, SY 6, SY 7, SY 8 anc the like, individually or as mixtures. The resulting products can re further purified by recrystallization or chromatography.The properties of salinomycins obtained by the process of this invention are shown in the following table 1.

New compounds, SY 3 through 8 are also obtained according to this invention. They are comparable to salinomycin in their activities against microorganisms and useful. as medicines. Also, because of their structural similarity to salinomycin, their usefulness as veterinary medicines looks very likely.
