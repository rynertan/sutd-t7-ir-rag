# ELECTROSURGICAL GENERATOR

## Abstract
An electrosurgical generator 10 comprises a source of electrosurgical current and output electrode circuitry 12 having an active electrode 22 for applying the electrosurgic al current to a patient 26 and a return electrode 24 for returning the current to the source 18 , and isolating circuitry for electrically isolating signal processing circuitry connected between the output electrode circuitry 12 and a reference potential such as ground 36 where the isolating circuitry includes an optical power supply 46 for optically powering the signal processing circuit and an optical output coupler for optically coupling output signals for the signal processing circuit to the electrosurgical current source. The signal processing circuitry may include a handpiece switch ing circuit and or a return electrode monitor circuit. Improve ments in the foregoing circuits are also disclosed.
