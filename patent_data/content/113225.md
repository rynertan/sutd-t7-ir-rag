# Image observation system.

## Abstract
An image observation system of the fibrescope type in which an optical pick up A is located at one end of an optical fibre 4 remote from a picture receiver C includes bellows 5, expanded and contracted by fluid pressure to move an element, such as an image pick up lens, within an image pick up. The bellows 8, 19 is connected via a fluid transfer tube 5 to a manually operated fluid pressure drive unit D. Manipulating the drive unit D forces a fluid into or withdraws a fluid from the bellows 8, 19 via the transfer pipe 5 to expand or contract the bellows, thereby controlling the position or attitude of the element located at the end of the fibre 4.
