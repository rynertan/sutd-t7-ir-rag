# Gas wiping apparatus and method of using.

## Abstract
A gas wiping die 121 for wiping wire 143 issuing from a molten metal coating bath 145 is provided with critical parameters with respect to the die angle, the length and thick ness of the die orifice 134 and the relationship of the sides of the orifice 134 , the throat diameter of the die 121 and the height above the molten bath surface 144 . The thickness of molten coatings on wire wiped with the combined die 121 can be very accurately controlled by changes in wiping gas pressure.
