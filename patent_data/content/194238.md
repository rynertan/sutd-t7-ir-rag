## Description
The invention refers to a development of Italian prior patent No. 9456 A 84 filed by the same inventor on 11 July 1984. According to the prior patent, a board for wooden floors is made up of an upper layer with viewable face, mostly of valuable wood, matched with a lower layer having a plywood construction and thus with sheets having the fibres pattern both orthogonal and parallel to that of the valuable layer the valuable layer _ intended to form the viewable face _ has a longitudinal fibres pattern and the lower plywood layer has transverse grooves being thus orthogonal to the fibres pattern of the upper layer. In the preferred embodiment of the prior invention patented with No. 9456 A. 84, the support layer consists of a plywood structure whose external sheets have longitudinal fibers, parallel to those of the layer of prestige wood it is understandable that in this condition both the layer of prestige wood and the top sheet of the support panel will deform in the same transverse direction with the result that the wood strip warps where, by warping, the curving of the width of the strips is intended . It follows, that in the case of a particularly dry environment, this prejudical phenomenon may cause the strip of prestige wood to become convex, or alternatively, in a very humid environment, concave. The grooves were expected to improve the overall elasticity of this wooden strip with respect to possible excessive longitudinal strain. A panel disclosed in French patent No. 659803 is produced with a supporting composite structure on which a very thin sheet of covering is veneered whose fibres are orthogonal to those of the support panel itself. The parallel position of the fibres of the four sheets of this support layer, does not make the size of the support stable. According to the present invention, the lower layer has the fibres patterns of the external sheets on thicknesses perpendicular to those of the upper valuable layer and, therefore, parallel to the grooves. In a possible embodiment, the lower plywood layer has five sheets or thicknesses, the intermediate thickness and the two external ones of said lower plywood layer having fibres being transverse in respect to those of the upper valuable layer. According to another feasible embodiment, the lower plywood layer has the two outer thicknesses or sheets with a fibres pattern transverse in respect to that of the upper valuable layer, and the intermediate sheet _ single or double _ with a fibres pattern parallel to that of the upper valuable layer. The proposed solution is particularly suitable for boards being relatively wide in respect to their length. The above mentioned transverse grooves may be deeply cut to involve at least most of the thickness of the lower layer. More particularly, in the grooves may have a width of the order of a least 3 mm. and such a depth as never to penetrate the upper layer and not to indent the adhesive veil which unites the valuable wood board to the lower plywood layer. In case of boards having mounting joints, the side cogs and slots for the installation joint are formed in the lower plywood layer. The invention will be better understood by following the description and the attached drawing which shows a practical non limitative exemplification of the same invention. In the drawing According to the drawing, a floor board is made up of an upper layer 21 of valuable wood and a lower layer 23 consisting of two external plywood sheets 23A, 23B and two intermediate sheets 23C . The fibres pattern of the layer 21 and of the sheets 23C is longitudinal, that is, lying in the direction fL of the board length the fibres pattern of sheets 23A, 23B is orientated in the transverse direction fT. In the drawing, the cross section taken on planes perpendicular to the fibres are conventionally squared and the cross sections parallel to the fibres pattern show a wide, wavy hatching. In the plywood layer 23A, 23B, 23C, 23C , transverse grooves 25 are cut out parallel to the direction fT and suitably spaced apart for the function already pointed out. The depth of the grooves does not go beyond the glueing surface 27 between 21 and 23B, and may also not go beyond the glueing surface 29 between 23B and 23C. The boards have rib projections 30 and channel recesses 32 _ shown only in Fig. 2 _ to form the joints. Both the projections,and the channels are formed from the layer 23 . Fig. 2 shows a five layer plywood, a central layer 23E being interposed between the thicknesses or sheets 23C the sheet or thickness 23E has the fibres pattern parallel to that of thicknesses 23A and 23B . The preparation of the above described material is similar to that point out in the above mentioned prior patent. It is understood that the drawing shows an exemplification given only as a practical demonstration of the invention, as this may vary in the forms and dispositions without departing from the scope of the idea on which the same invention is based, and as disclosed in the attached claims.
