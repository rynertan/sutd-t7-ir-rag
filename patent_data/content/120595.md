# Prosthetic acetabular cup.

## Abstract
The assembly includes an inner liner 4 contacting an outer backing 8 and a plurality of spacers 6 mechanically entrapped between the inner liner and the outer backing. Mechanically entrapping the spacers between the inner liner and the outer backing allows the spacers to be made of a material different from that of the inner liner and of the outer backing. This, in turn, allows the spacers to be changed as the cements change without affecting the inner liner or the outer backing.
