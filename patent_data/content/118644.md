# Cathode assembly for glow discharge deposition apparatus.

## Abstract
In a apparatus for glow discharge deposition process gases are commonly introduced into a deposition chamber 29 from a gas manifold 36 disposed on the upstream side of a substrate 11 . As the process gases are drawn across the surface of the substrate, they are continuously disassoci ated and recombined under the influence of an electro magnetic field developed by a deposition cathode or micro wave generator. By providing a 62 precathode system upstream of the deposition cathode or microwave generator, a impurities in the process gases, b contaminants from the walls of the deposition chamber and c initially disasso ciated and recombined process gas compositions may be deposited onto and collected from a collection plate dis posed upstream of the substrate 11 . In this manner, higher order chains of the process gases are subjected to the upstream electromagnetic field and are therefore more easily broken down by the deposition cathode and deposited onto the substrate in desired lower order chains and compositions so as to provide improved electrical prop erties.
