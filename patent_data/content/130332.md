# Digital electronic musical instrument of pitch synchronous sampling type.

## Abstract
A digital electronic musical instrument is constituted by detector, a phase angle, information generator and a musi cal tone generator. The detector detects an end portion of a period of a musical tone to be produced. The phase angle information generator repetitively generates phase angle information representing an instantaneous phase angle of the musical tone during from start to end of the period of the musical tone in response to the detection of the end portion of the period. The musical tone generator synthesizes the musical tone in accordance with the phase angle informa tion. Operations of the detector, phase angle information generator and tone generator are performed on the basis of clock pulses having a predetermined frequency which is an integer multiple of a fundamental frequency of the musi cal tone to be produced, thereby realizing the so called pitch synchronous system and simplifying the construction of the musical instrument.
