## Description
ZEOLITE CATALYST WITH ENHANCED CATALYTIC ACTIVITY AND METHOD OF PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF This invention relates to a zeolite with enhanced acid catalytic activity suitable for use in catalytic processes catalyzed by acid catalysts, the method of preparation of the zeolite, and organic compound conversion, e.g., catalytic cracking, processes using a catalyst comprising the activity enhanced zeolite. Hydrocarbon conversion processes utilizing crystalline zeolites have been the subject of extensive investigation during recent years, as is obvious from both the patent and scientific literature. Crystalline zeolites have been found to be particularly effective for a wide variety of hydrocarbon conversion processes including the catalytic cracking of a gas oil to produce motor fuels and have been described and claimed in many patents, including U.S.Patents 3,140,249 3,140,251 3,140,252 3,140,253 and 3,271,418.It is also known in the prior art to incorporate the crystalline zeolite into a matrix for catalytic cracking and such disclosure appears in one or more of the above identified U.S. patent5. It is also known that improved results will be obtained with regard to the catalytic cracking of gas oils if a crystalline zeolite having a pore size of less than 7 Angstrom units is included with a crystalline zeolite having a pore size greater than 8Angstrom units, either with or without a matrix. A disclosure of this type is found in U.S. Patent 3,769,202. Improved results in catalytic cracking with respect to both octane number and overall yield are reported in U.S. Patent 3,758,403. In this patent, the cracking catalyst is comprised of a large pore size crystalline zeolite pore size greater than 7Angstrom units in admixture with ZSM 5 zeolite wherein the ratio ofZSM 5 type zeolite to large pore size crystalline zeolite is in the range of 1 10 to 3 1. The use of ZSM 5 zeolite in conjunction with a zeolite cracking catalyst of the X or Y faujasite variety is described inU.S. Patents 3,894,931 3,894,933 and 3,894,934. The two former patents disclose the use of ZSM 5 zeolite in amounts up to and about 5 to 10 weight percent the latter patent discloses the weight ratio of ZSM 5 zeolite to large pore size crystalline zeolite in the range of 1 10 to 3 1. The addition of very small amounts of pure, finely divided shape selective catalyst to a conventional FCC catalyst, is taught in U.S. Patent 4,309,280. This patent teaches the advantage of using, as the powdered additive catalyst, a ZSM 5 zeolite with very high silica alumina ratios. Use of a 1500 to 1 SiO2 A1203 mole ratio ZSM 5 catalyst in conjunction with a fluid cracking process is disclosed in Example 8 and Example 13. Use of a ZSM 5 material with an even higher ratio is disclosed in Example 9, which adds a ZSM 5 material containing only 15 ppm A1203. The patentees comment that the preferred additives, shape selective zeolites such as ZSM 5, are very active even with high silica to alumina mole ratios.This activity is considered surprising, since catalytic activity of zeolites has generally been attributed to cations associated with framework aluminum atoms. U.S. Patent 4,309,279 discloses the addition of very small amounts of a special class of zeolites characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio greater than 12 and a constraint index of about 1 to 12, to conventional cracking catalyst. The patentees included a teaching, but no examples, to addition of shape selective zeolites, e.g., ZSM 5, with very high silica to alumina mole ratios, up to 30,000 and greater. In U.S. Patent 4,340,465 the patentees teach use of ZSM 5 catalyst with very high silica to alumina mole ratios for catalytic cracking. The examples in this patent show that as the silica to alumina mole ratio is increased, the activity of the catalyst, as measured by the weight percent conversion, is decreased. In going from a sieve containing 2.3 weight percent Al, to 0.45 to 0.04 wt , the weight percent conversion declines from 34 to 12 to 7, respectively. This indicates a significant loss in cracking activity when using ZSM 5 with a relatively low aluminum content. Some work has been done on removal of aluminum from relatively large pore zeolites such as mordenite. In U.K. patent specification 1,151,653, the patentees disclose that the hydrogen form of a zeolite was preferred for many hydrocarbon conversion processes, and teach a combination treatment of the zeolite with acid and an ammonium compound to achieve the desired hydrogen form.The treatment includes boiling with acid, which would extract some aluminum. In addition, U.K. patent specification 1,261,616 teaches a method of making acid extracted mordenite. Some work has also been reported on preparation of aluminum deficient faujasites in Chemistry of Crystalline Aluminosilicates ,G.T. err, the Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 72, 1968, pages 2594 2596 and in U.S. Patent 3,442,795. In this article, it is noted that aluminum is removed directly from sodium zeolite Y, using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA. This reference teaches that as most of the Al is removed from the NaY, the crystallinity of the material changes, and indeed is lost when less than 20 percent of the original aluminum framework content remains. This reference reported increased sorptive capacity, based on the number of grams of SiO2 in the samples, up to about 70 percent aluminum removal, after which sorptive capacity decreased. Many of the foregoing prior art reference teachings would lead the skilled artisan to conclude that the catalytic acid activity of aluminosilicate zeolites is directly related to the aluminum content of the zeolite. It has been surprisingly discovered, however, that under certain conditions the acid activity of some aluminosilicate zeolites can be enhanced by treating the zeolite with aluminum extracting agents which actually cause some aluminum to be removed from the zeolite and in particular from the zeolite framework structure. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for treating an aluminosilicate zeolite in order to enhance its catalytic acid activity. Such a process comprises contacting a zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least about 12 with an aluminum extracting reagent under particular conditions. Such conditions include a temperature of from 50 to 3000C, a pressure sufficient to maintain the aluminum extracting reagent in the liquid phase and a reaction time and overall reaction conditions sufficient to increase the acid activity of the zeolite. The present invention also relates to the use of such treated zeolite materials as catalysts for conversion of organic, e.g., hydrocarbon, compounds and to catalyst composites containing such activity enhanced zeolites. The aluminosilicate zeolites which are useful in the present invention are those which, prior to treatment, have a silica to alumina molar ratio of at least about 12, preferably at least about 35, and more preferably at least about 70. Zeolite A, for example, with a silica to alumina molar ratio of 2.0, is not useful in the present invention. Preferred zeolites are those having a Constraint Index of from about 1 to 12, i.e., the 7SM 5 type zeolites. ZSM 5 type zeolites, i.e., zeolites of silica alumina molar ratio greater than about 12 and of a Constraint Index of 1 to 12 are well known. Zeolites of this type have previously been employed in catalyst treatment methods for enhancing catalyst activity such as the method described in U.S. Patent 4,326,994. Crystalline zeolites of the type preferred for use in the zeolite treatment proceses of the present invention include zeolite beta, ZSM 5, ZSM ll, ZSM 12,ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, and ZSM 48, preferably ZSM 5, ZSM 12 andZSM 23, with ZSM 5 and ZSM 12 being particularly preferred. Zeolite beta is described in U.S. Patent 3,308,069 and inU.S. Reissue Patent RE 28343, which references disclose, in particular, the X ray diffraction pattern of zeolite beta. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patents Nos.3,702,886 and Re 29,948 which patents provide the X ray diffraction pattern of therein disclosed ZSM 5. ZSM ll is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979 which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of said ZSM l1. ZSM 12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449 which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 12. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842 which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 23. ZSM 35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245 which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 35. ZSM 38 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,859 which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 38. ZSM 48 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,375,573 and EuropeanPatent Publication EP A 0015132, which disclose in particular theX ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 48. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are substantially catalytically inactive, possibly because the intra crystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 540 C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 540 C in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite.More generally, it is desirable to activate this type catalyst by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 540 C for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Thus when synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form. As discussed in greater detail hereinafter, it is preferred to utilize zeolites in either the hydrogen or ammonium form in the activity enhancing zeolite treatment process of this invention. In accordance with the present invent ion, aluminosilicate zeolites, and preferably the ZSM 5 type zeolites, are contacted under particular conditions with an aluminum extracting reagent. It is preferred to extract aluminum from the zeolite using a strong mineral acid, a chelating agent or other complexing agent or some combination of these reagents. The starting zeolite material is usually in the hydrogen form for best removal of aluminum from the zeolite framework. The hydrogen form may be generated in situ, e.g., if an acid is used for the aluminum extraction, the H form is made in situ. Another way would be to ion exchange with NH4 , to thereafter calcine in the presence of water vapor or steam, causing removal of some A1 from the framework, and finally to then ion exchange this now cat ironic Al with a salt, e.g., an NH4 salt. The latter ion exchange can be facilitated by using a chelating agent, e.g., No4 2 H2EDTA, for the NH4 exchange. The EDTA removes the A13 ions from the ion exchange equilibrium by complexing. NH4 2 H2 EDTA does not remove framework Al, while H4 EDTA does. When a strong acid is used to extract aluminum, any mineral acid such as phosphoric, hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric or HF may be used, as well as mixtures thereof, Use of relatively concentrated sulfuric or hydrochloric acids, e.g., 1 to 10 normal, gives good acid extraction by simply heating the zeolite in the acid solution.Temperatures of 50 to 3000C may be used, with pressures sufficient to maintain a liquid phase. Preferably temperatures of 90 to 250 C are used, with temperatures of 100 to 1600C most preferred. It is more difficult to remove aluminum from the zeolites of the ZSM 5 type than from larger pore zeolites, e.g., Y and mordenite. Somewhat more severe extracting conditions are needed.The best extracting agent cannot remove Al from the zeolite, if the pores are too small for the hydrated A13 to pass through. When aluminum sites are referred to, tetrahedral or framework sites are usually meant. These sites are not associated with water of hydration. However, when this Al is hydrolyzed out of the 3 framework, then the small Al cations of high charge density are surrounded by water of hydration. It may be possible to use weaker acids, e.g., six normal acetic acid, or very dilute solutions of strong mineral acids, e.g., 0.1 N H2S04, but when such an approach is taken, higher temperatures or longer acid extraction times will be necessary. The other general approach to aluminum removal is use of a chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA, nitrilo triacetic acid, NTA, or other chelating agents. The chelating agent, e.g., EDTA, does not go into the zeolite pores. It only removes the A13 migrating out of the pores from the ion exchange equilibrium by complexing. Thus, the chelating agent does not actually remove the A1 from the framework. This latter reaction is caused by the reaction of the H form zeolite with water hydrolysis . The minimum amount of chelating agent that must be added is that required by stoichiometry to remove the desired amount of aluminum from the zeolite, e.g., from the zeolite framework. The upper limit on amount of chelating agent that is added is set more by economics than anything else. It is possible to operate with a large excess of chelating agent and shorten the amount of time, or temperature, required for aluminum extraction. The preferred chelating agent is EDTA. It is preferred to operate with 1 to 10 times the EDTA required by stoichiometry. The process can be conducted simply in a container with water, at temperatures of 50 C to 2500C, with pressure sufficient to maintain a liquid phase reaction medium. It is also possible to combine both aluminum extraction techniques when desired. In one embodiment the zeolite will be subjected to aluminum extraction with a strong mineral acid, followed by aluminum extraction using a chelating agent. In another embodiment, extraction of aluminum will first be conducted using a chelating agent, followed by strong acid extraction. In yet another embodiment, some chelating agent may be added to the acid solution used to extract aluminum, or some strong mineral acid may be added to the solution containing chelating agent. At least some aluminum removal from the zeolite is necessary. Significant improvement in activity occurs in some zeolites with a constraint index of 1 to 12, and a silica to alumina ratio greater than 12 when only 5 of the zeolite aluminum is removed. Preferably 10 to 90 of the aluminum is removed from the zeolites treated herein. More usually removal of from 15 to 50 of the aluminum from the zeolite will be effected. Preferably, there is limited removal of at least some of the zeolite framework aluminum by an acid treatment process. Such acid treatment with its associated removal of aluminum leads to enhanced catalytic activity. Treatment of the zeolite with the aluminum extracting agent is carried out to the extent necessary to effect an increase in the acid activity of the zeolite so treated. The degree of zeolite catalyst activity for all acid catalyzed reactions can be measured and compared by means of alpha value a . The alpha value reflects the relative activity of the catalyst with respect to a high activity silica alumina cracking catalyst.To determine the alpha value as such term is used herein, n hexane conversion is determined at a suitable temperature between about 550 F 10000F 288 C 538 C , preferably at 1000 F 538 C . Conversion is varied by variation in space velocity such that a conversion level of up to about 60 of per unit volume of zeolite and compared with that of silica alumina catalyst which is normalized to a reference activity of 1000 F 5380C . Catalyst activity of a catalyst is expressed as a multiple of this standard, i.e., the silica alumina standard. The silica alumina reference catalyst contains about 10 percentA1203 and the remainder SiO2. This method of determining alpha is in general more fully described in the Journal ofCatalysis, Vol.VI, pages 278 287, 1966. In using the treated zeolites of the present invention as catalysts, it may be desirable to incorporate the above described activity enhanced crystalline zeolites in another material resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in organic compound conversion processes. Such matrix materials include synthetic and naturally occurring substances, as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides.Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie,McNamee Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modifications. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, and silica titania, as well as ternary compositions, such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix, on an anhydrous basis, may vary widely with the zeolite content ranging from between about 1 to about 90 percent by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80 percent by weight of the dry composite. The matrix component in such catalyst composites thus ranges from about 10 to 99 by weight, more preferably from about 20 to 95 by weight of the composite. The treated zeolites of the present invention may be used in many organic compound, e.g., hydrocarbon compound, conversion processes, though not all zeolites of this invention will be equally useful in all processes. Employing a catalytically active form of the composition of this invention containing a hydrogenation component, heavy petroleum residual stocks, cycle stocks, and other hydrocrackable charge stocks can be hydrocracked at temperatures between about 200 to 450or using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon charge in the range between 2 and 80. The pressure employed will vary between 1 to 200 atmospheres absolute atm. abs. , and the liquid hourly space velocity between 0.1 and 10. A catalytically active form of the composition of this invention can be employed for catalytic cracking, hydrocarbon cracking stocks can be cracked at a liquid hourly space velocity between about 0.5 and 50, a temperature between about 275 C to 600 C, a pressure between about subatmospheric and several hundred atmospheres. Employing a catalytically active form of a member of the family of zeolites of this invention containing a hydrogenation component, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature between about 350 C to 550C. The pressure can be between about 5 to 100 atm., abs., but is preferably between 15 to 50 atm., abs. The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between 0.1 and 10, preferably between 0.4 and 4 and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is generally between 1 and 20 preferably between 4 and 12. A catalytically active form of the composition of this invention can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins, when provided with a hydrogenation component, e.g., platinum. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature between about 0 to 4000C, preferably about 1500C to 3000C, with a liquid hourly space velocity between 0.01 and 2, preferably between 0.25 and 0.50 employing hydrogen such that the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is between 1 1 and 5 1. Additionally, the catalyst can be used for olefin isomerization employing temperatures between about 0 to 4000C. Other reactions which can be accomplished employing a catalytically active form of the composition of this invention with or without a metal, e.g., platinum, include hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions and desulfurization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization , aromatics alkylation, aromatics isomerization, disproportionation, transalkylation, and other organic compound conversion such as the conversion of alcohols e.g.methanol to hydrocarbon . As mentioned hereinbefore, the zeolites produced in accordance with the present invention are especially useful in cracking. The catalytic cracking process can be either fixed bed, moving bed or fluidized bed and the hydrocarbon charge stock flow may be either concurrent or countercurrent to the conventional catalyst flow. The process of this invention is particularly applicable to the fluid catalytic cracking FCC process. Fluidized catalytic cracking is especially benefited by the use of the zeolites, preferably ZSM 5, of the present invention.When used in an FCC operation, the zeolites are preferably in a matrix as hereinbefore described such as silica alumina, silicamagnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titania, as well as ternary compositions such as silicaalumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix can be in the form of a cogel. A mixture of clay in combination with silica or any of the above specified cogels to form a matrix is highly preferred. The treated zeolites of the present invention may beneficially be mixed with conventional cracking catalysts.Conventional cracking catalysts contain active components which may be zeolitic or non zeolitic. The non zeolitic active components are generally amorphous silica alumina and crystalline silica alumina.However, the major conventional cracking catalysts presently in use generally comprise a crystalline zeolite active component in a suitable matrix. Representative crystalline zeolite active component constituents of conventional cracking catalysts include zeolite A U.S. Patent 2,882,243 , zeolite X U.S. Patent 2,882,244 , zeoliteY U.S. Patent 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U.S. Patent 3,247,195 , zeolite ZK 4 U.S. Patent 3,314,752 , synthetic mordenite and dealuminized synthetic mordenite, merely to name a few, as well as naturally occurring zeolites, including chabazite, faujasite, mordenite, and the like. Preferred crystalline zeolites include the synthetic faujasite zeolites X and Y, with particular preference being accorded zeolite Y. In general, the treated crystalline zeolites are ordinarily ion exchanged either separately or in the final catalyst with a desired cation to replace alkali metal present in the zeolite as found naturally or as synthetically prepared. The exchange treatment is such as to reduce the alkali metal content of the final catalyst to less than about 1.5 weight percent and preferably less than about 0.5 weight percent. The purpose of ion exchange is to substantially remove alkali metal cations which are known to be deleterious to cracking, as well as to introduce particularly desired catalytic activity by means of the various cations used in the exchange medium. For the cracking operation described herein, preferred cations are hydrogen, ammonium, rare earth and mixtures thereof, with particular preference being accorded rare earth.Ion exchange is suitably accomplished by conventional contact of the zeolite with a suitable salt solution of the desired cation such as, for example, the sulfate, chloride or nitrate. The above compositions may be readily processed so as to provide fluid cracking catalysts by spray drying the composite to form microspheroidal particles of suitable size. Alternatively, the composition may be adjusted to suitable concentration and temperature to form bead type catalyst particles suitable for use in moving bed type cracking systems. The catalyst may also be used in various other forms such as those obtained by tabletting, balling or extruding. Hydrocarbon charge stocks undergoing cracking in accordance with this invention comprise hydrocarbons generally and, in particular, petroleum fractions having an initial boiling point of at least 2000C, a 50 point range of at least 260at and an end point of at least 320 C. Such hydrocarbon fractions include gas oils, residual oils, cycle stocks, whole top crudes and heavy hydrocarbon fractions derived by the destructive hydrogenation of coal, tar, pitches, asphalts and the like. As will be recognized, the distillation of higher boiling petroleum fractions above about 400 C must be carried out under vacuum in order to avoid thermal cracking.The boiling temperatures utilized herein are expressed in terms of convenience of the boiling point corrected to atmospheric pressure. The catalyst may be steamed prior to use, for instance, in a thermofor catalytic cracking TCC unit. Steaming is usually not necessary when the catalyst is to be used in an FCC unit. EXAMPLESExample 1 Zeolite Starting Material The basic zeolite starting material used for subsequent testing was prepared as follows A 250 g sample of small size 0.02 to 0.03 micron ZSM 5 SiO2 A1203S 40 was sized to 8 10 mesh and calcined in a tube furnace in an ammonia stream to 600 C and held at this temperature for one hour. The material was then cooled to room temperature in an ammonia stream. The product was exchanged three times with a solution being 0.1 N in NH4Cl and 0.1N in NH40H, using 50 cc g, at room temperature with occasional stirring for two hours each. The material was then filtered, washed chloride free and dried at ambient temperature. This material, after the above ion exchange treatment was subjected to conventional calcination, three hours at 5380C. It contained 4.5 wt A1203 and had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 267. After steaming two hours at 593 C with 100 atmospheric steam, alpha was 25. Alpha Test Discussion An examination of the dispersion in alpha values was conducted to assess the precision of the alpha test. A series of tests was conducted over a several month period with catalyst having alpha activities around 50, 100, and 200. Based upon about 100 tests, the relative standard deviation was on the order of 15 percent, based on an average of all tests.Example 2 EDTA Extraction The benefits of the proposed acid treatment are described inExample 2. Here the ammonium form of Example 1 was treated withEDTA, reducing the A1203 content from 4.5 wt to 3 wt with unexpected increase in alpha activity both after calcining and after steaming. The ammonium form of ZSM 5 prepared in example 1, 10 g, was reslurried with 200 g of water. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 2.5 g, was added. The mixture was sealed in a teflon jar and heated in a pressurized steam box to 1500C for 24 hours. The product was filtered, washed with hot water and dried at ambient temperature.It contained 3.0 wt A1203 and had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 600 after calcining at 538 C for three hours. After steaming for two hours at 539 C with 100 steam at atmospheric pressure, alpha was 56.Example 3 H2501 Extraction In like manner a similar base material as Example 1 was treated with concentrated H2S04 diluted with 100g H20. Here again the acid treatment reduced the At203 content from 4.5 to 3.0 and increased the alpha activity both after calcining and after steaming. A duplicate preparation of example 1, 10 g, was slurried with 100 g of water. Concentrated sulfuric acid, 5.0 g, was added with stirring. The reaction mixture was sealed in a teflon jar and heated to 1500C. for 24 hours. The product was filtered, washed until free of sulfate, and dried at ambient temperature. It contained 3.0 wt A1203 and had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 561 after calcining at 5380C for three hours. After steaming for two hours at 5930C, alpha was 58. Example 4 EDTA Extraction This example shows the catalytic improvement resulting from an EDTA treatment which reduced the A1203 to 3.5 wt while increasing the alpha activity. A duplicate preparation of example 1 was treated with 2.5 g.EDTA and 200 g of water for 24 hours at 1000C. The washed and dried product contained 3.5 wt A1203 and had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 769.Example 5 H2SO4 Extraction Another small size starting material was treated with concentrated H2SO4 or source of acid to produce a zeolite with a 3.4 wt Awl203. A 250 g sample of small size about 0.02 to 0.03 microns or perhaps slightly smaller ZS.M 5 Si02 Al2O3 40 was sized, calcined and cooled in an ammonia stream as described in example 1, but not ion exchanged. Excess ammonia was removed by flushing with nitrogen at room temperature. A 140 g sample of this material was slurried with 1400 g of water. Concentrated sulfuric acid, 70 g, was added with stirring.The mixture was heated in a teflon jar to 1500C for 24 hours. The product was separated by filtration, washed sulfate free and dried at room temperature. It contained 3.4 wt Al2O3 and had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 764. After steaming for two hours at 5930C, alpha was 41.Examples 6 and 7 Examples 6 and 7 show the catalytic advantages for an acidEDTA treatment on a large size 1 micron ZSM 5 withSiO2 A1203 ratios of about 70 1. Here the acid treatment as shown by Example 7 showed that a slight reduction in alumina from 2.3 wt t Ex. 6 to 2.2 wt Ex. 7 had a significant effect on activity increasing the calcined alpha from 324 to 458 and steamed alpha from 58 to 102. These dramatic changes suggest that not only some aluminum is removed but that some of the aluminum could be redistributed and contribute to the enhanced activity in the larger size ZSM 5.Example 6 Zeolite Starting Material A sample of large size ZSM 5 about 1.0 microns SiO2 A1203 X 70 was calcined and ion exchanged in the same manner as described in example 1. The ammonium form prepared contained 2.3 wt Al203. After calcining three hours at 538 C, it had a n hexane cracking activity of alpha 324. After steaming for two hours at 5930C, alpha was 58.Example 7 EDTA Extraction In this example, the product of Example 6 is acid treated.The ammonium form prepared in example 6, 10 g, was slurried with 100 g of water. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1.25 g, was added, and the mixture was heated in a sealed teflon jar to 1500C for 24 hours. The product was filtered and washed with hot water. The product contained 2.2 wt A1203. After calcining for three hours at 5380C, the n hexane cracking activity was alpha 458.After steaming for two hours at 593 C, alpha was 102.Example 8 EDTA Extraction This example illustrates the effect of an acid treatment on a higher Si02 A1203 70 1 starting material. Here the charges in alpha activity both calcined and steamed after the EDTA treatment were not as pronounced as with the 40 1 SiO2 A1203 used inExamples 1 5. The ammonium form of small size ZSM 5 of SiO2 A1203 70 was treated with EDTA at 3000F NF ZSM 5 NH4 ZSM 5 Si02 A1203 70 EDTA treated Al2O3, wt 2.6 2.1 Alpha, Calcined 380 391 Alpha, steamed 2 hrs ommat 593 C 5930C 22 26 Examples 9 and 10 The following examples demonstrate the effect of acid treatment on ZSM 12. Examples 9 and 10 show that the activity of aZSM 12 zeolite can also be enhanced by aluminum extraction.Example 9 Zeolite Starting Material A sample of ZSM 12 about loesize crystals , crystallized in the presence of methyltriethylammonium ions and having aSi02 A1203 of4kb120 was sized 14 25 mesh, calcined and ammonium ion exchanged in the same manner as described in Example 1. After washing and drying at ambient temperature, the product contained 1.3 alumina, based on ignited weight, and 0.01 residual sodium. The n hexane cracking activity of the material calcined for 3 hours at 5380C in air was 82. After steaming for two hours at 593 C with 100 steam of atmospheric pressure, alpha was 33. Example 10 H2 X Extraction The same starting material as in Example 9 was calcined in a nitrogen stream for 2 hours at 6000C. After this time the nitrogen was replaced by air, and the calcination was continued for two more hours. Fifty grams of the calcined material was slurried with 300 g of water. Then 15 g of conc. sulfuric acid was added. The slurry was sealed in a Teflon bottle and heated in a pressure steam box at 300 F 1490C for 24 hours. The solid was then washed with hot water until free of sulfate and dried at ambient temperature. The alumina content was reduced to 1.15, based on ignited weight, corresponding to a SiO2 Al203 of 142. The material, calcined at 538 C for three hours, had an alpha activity of 144. After steaming for 2 hours at 593 C, the alpha was 42. The significance of these examples is that the cracking activity, or acid activity of the catalyst as measured by the alpha number, increases although aluminum has been removed from the zeolite. When starting with a relatively low silica alumina ZSM 5, theZSM 5 used in Examples 1 5, with a 40 1 silica to alumina mole ratio, the acid extraction techniques of the present invention improve the alpha activity both before and after steaming as compared to no aluminum removal. These experimental results are not unique to ZSM 5, other shape selective zeolites, such as those in Examples 8 10, showed similar results. Extraction of aluminum from ZSM 12 whether by strong acid, or use of chelating agent, significantly Increased the alpha activity of the catalyst after conventional steaming treatment.
