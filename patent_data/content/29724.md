# Quick set low methoxyl pectin composition.

## Abstract
A cold water soluble quick setting low methoxyl pectin dry mix composition providing smooth, continuous and uniform gels having good texture and mouth feel charac teristics is prepared by combining a low methoxyl pectin which has been co dried with a protective amount of buffer and a solubilizing amount of sugar with a slowly soluble calcium ion source in an amount sufficient for gel formation and a slowly dissolving edible acid in an amount which will provide a final pH of from about 3.5 to 4.5 upon dissolution of the mix in water.
