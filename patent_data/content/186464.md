# Electrographic touch sensor.

## Abstract
A resistor electrode type touch sensor having enhanced area of linear response by reducing the bow in perimeters of the sensor and the method of accomplishing the same. A resistive coating is applied to one surface of a substrate. Within this coating orthogonal electrical fields are produced to give coordinates of a selected position. Overlying, but spaced from, the resistive coating is a flexible pick off sheet having a conductive layer facing the resistive layer which will contact the resistive coating when the pick off sheet is touched at a selected position. A resistance element is positioned proximate, but insulated from, the perimeter of the resistive coating. Electrodes of a selected effective size and spacing are located along selected paths proximate the edges of the resistive coating. Each electrode is attached to the resistive coating and connected to selected positions along the resistance element to provide selected voltages to the resistive coating. The effective size and spacing of the electrodes, and the positions of connection to the resistance element, are selected to produce an effective voltage gra dient at the electrodes that progressively decreases from corners of the sensor to the center line of each edge of the sensor to counteract any voltage drop along the resistance element when voltage are applied thereto so as to substan tially eliminate the bow of electrical fields produced in the resistive coating.
