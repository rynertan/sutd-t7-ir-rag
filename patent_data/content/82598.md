# Pulsed laser range finder training or test device.

## Abstract
The basic problem of use of the pulsed laser range finder is the problem of safety, which inhibits training use and testing of the laser range finder. A training or test device is provided operable to allow actual firing of a pulsed laser range finder in safe conditions for training or test purposes. This device, for a pulsed laser range finder having a reflected laser beam radiation receiver and an associated range distance indicator, includes a pulsed laser light trap having a housing 2 attachable over an output aperture of the laser to receive and dissipate safely a beam of radiation therefrom without emmision of an eye damaging amount of radiation, means 5,6 in the housing for receiving an incident laser beam from the range finder, when fired, and for dissipating the received laser beam, at least one detector 7 operable to register the presence of the laser beam in the housing 2 and provide a corresponding output signal, a timer for receiving the output signal from the at least one detector 7 and imparting a delay period to the output signal corresponding to the time normally taken for the laser beam to reach an object at a predetermined range and return therefrom, a source 10 of a simulated return signal operable in response to the delayed output signal received from the timer to provide a simulated reflected laser beam return signal, and means for feeding the simulated return signal to the reflected laser beam radiation receiver for consequent operation of the associated range distance indicator.
