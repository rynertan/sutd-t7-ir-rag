# Cup dispenser.

## Abstract
A dispenser for dispensing cups singly from a stack of cups has a plurality of cams 18, 28 spaced about a vertical axis 16 , coaxial with the axis of the stack of cups, and drive means 20 for rotating the cams toge ther about their associated axes 19 . Each of the cams has a cam face 30 which is a helix about its axis and is arranged to engage the rim of the end cup of a stack of cups located in the dispenser so that rotation of the cams pushes the end cup away from the stack to dispense it. The invention provides that the dispensing cam face of each cam is chamfered, preferably at an angle in the range 22 to 28 with respect to a diameter of the cam. Preferably the upwardly directed cam face which engages the next cup in the stack and holds the stack up as the lowermost cup is dispensed is also chamfered, with advantage in the range 19 to 26 . The spiral angle of the helix of each cam is preferably in the range 8 to 14 and the effective length of the cam face preferably extends through at least 270 around the cam.

## Description
cup DISPENSER The invention relates to a cup dispenser particularly for dispensing cups singly from a stack o cups which will normally be a vertical stac. The dispenser is of the sort in which a plurality of cams are spaced about a first axis coaxial with the axis of the stack of cups and drive means are provided for rotating the cams together, each about can associated exis parallel to the first axis. Each of the cams has a cam face which is a helix about its axis and is arran to engage the rim of the end cup of a stack of cups located in the dispenser so that rotation of the cams in one direction pushes the end cup away from the remainder of the stack to dispense it. Conventionally the dispensing cam face is downwardly facing and in the direction of any diameter is normal to the axis of rotation of the cam. vSe have found that conventional cam faces do not always provide a satisfactory dispensing action and tend to dig into the rim of a cup. An object of the present invention is to provide a cam profile which provides a more satisfactory dispensing action and minimizes damage to the rim of a cup being dispensed. According to this invention the cam face of each cam is chamfered or radiused with respect to any diameter of the cam. Preferably the angle of chamfer is in a ranee 220 to 28 and with advantage substantially 25 . Such a cam profile is particularly suited for use with foam o s dispenses the cups without damaging their rims Preferably each cam also has an upwardly facing cam surface for engaging the next cup in the stack and holding up the stack as the lowermost cup is dispensed. Preferably this upwardly directed cam face is also cho erred with respect to any diameter, preferably the chamfer angle being in the range 190 to 260 and with advantage substantially 22210. The spiral angle of the helix of the dispensing cam face may be in the range 80 to 140, preferably in the range 700 to 120 and with advantage substantially 110. The effective length of the cam face extends through at least 2700 around the cam and with advantage through over 5000. The dispenser preferably comprises a hollow casing in which the cam and drive, in the form of a ring gear, are mounted, with a central aperture in the top and bottom for receiving the stack of cups and dispensing them downwardly.According to another feature of the invention the casing is made in top and bottom identical halves which are secured together by bolts or the like. The bolts can be additionally used to secure the casing to a mounting and the arrangement is such that the bolts can be inserted from either the top or the bottom to extend beyond either the bottom or top respectively for mounting to a surface either beneath or above the dispenser. One embodiment of cup dispenser will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Fig. 1 is a plan view with the top half of the casing removed,Fig. 2 is an axial section on the line II II of Fig. 1 but with the top half of the casing shown, Fig. 3 is a view showing some cups of a stack engaged by two cam projections,Fig. 4 is a side view of one cam of the dispenser, andFig. 5 is a development view of the cam of Fig. 3 on an enlarged scale. The dispenser has a hollow casing 12 having identical upper and lower halves 13 and 14 respectively, connected together by three equiangularly spaced bolts 15. The dispenser has a vertical axis 16 and its top and bottom are effectively open and define coaxial bores 17 to locate a cup stacking tube not shown at the top and an outlet guide tube not shown at the bottom. Six cams 18 are mounted in the casing equiangularly spaced about the axis 16, the cams being angularly oscillatable about their own axes 19 by means of a common ring gear 20. The ring gear 20 is formed on its inner periphery with teeth 21 which engage a pinion gear portion 22 of each of the cams.The ring gear 20 has an operating handle 23 which projects through an aperture 24 in the casing and by means of which the ring gear can be reciprocated through an angle of 300 as indicated by the arrow 25. The ring gear is shown in one extreme position, the rest position, in Fig. 1 in which a flat upright surface 26 of each cam faces inwardly and surfaces 26 form together a hexagon and a support member 27 of each cam projects into the central space of the dispenser and engages under the lip of the lowermost cup to hold up the stack. Each cam has a cam projection 28 around its surface, the cam projection 28 having a helically formed downwardly facing dispensing surface 30 and an upwardly facing surface 31.These surfaces are both chamfered at an angle to any diameter of the cam, in this example the lower cam face 30 making ar angle of 250 with such diameter and the upper cam ace making an angle of 22 with such diameter. As the operating handle 23 is moved from the rest position shown in Fig. 1 the cams are rotated together to enter the cam projections between the lips of the lowermost cup and the second lowermost cup as best seen in Fig. 3. The cups are made of expanded polystyrene. Further rotation of the cams pushes the lowermost cup downwardly away from the stack due to the helical form while the upper faces 31 continue to support the stack. The operating handle is then reciprocated back to its rest position in which the cam projections do not engage the cups which are supported on the members 27. The end of each member 27 is radiused as indicated at 32. As best seen in Fig. 5 the spiral angle of the helix indicated at 34 is 110. Each of the halves of the casing are formed with six recesses and aligned pairs of recesses form bearing seats for the opposite projecting shaft portions 33 of the cams. For receiving the bolts 15, the halves of the casing are each formed with a countersunk bore 36 opening to the outer that is the upper or lower surface, extending inwardly to a counter bore 37 of smaller diameter which in turn opens to the inner surface via a further bore 38 of diameter greater than bore 37. A rin dowel 40 is located in the aligned mating bores 38 and through this the bolt 15 passes. Each bolt can be inserted from either the top or the bottom with its head located in one of the bores 36 and a threaded member 40 located in the other bore 36 for mating with the bolt. The end 41 of the bolt then projects beyond one bore 36 and can be used for mounting the dispenser on its machine chassis or wall brackets. This arrangement allows the two casing halves to be made in the same mould and eliminates the need for a separate fixing means to mount the dispenser. It allows the dispenser to be mounted either to an upwardly or a downwardly facing surface.
