# Water in oil emulsions and process for preparing same.

## Abstract
A high internal phase water in oil emulsion comprises, in addition to water, a branched chain non polar oil, a liquid emulsifier having an HLB value of from 1 to 7 and a special montmorillonite clay derivative which stabilises the emul sion. The emulsion can optionally also include a source of magnesium ions which further enhance its stability during storage. The emulsion is particularly suitable as a cosmetic cream for topical application to the skin.
