# Error correcting memory system.

## Abstract
Data from a CPU 2 is fed to a DATA portion of a RAM 22 for storage therein, and to a parity generator PG to generate check bits for storage in a check bit CB portion of RAM 22. To read a word, the data and check bit portions are read into latches 24 and 34. The check bits are compared at32 with fresh parity bits from 26 generated from the data portion. Decoder 38 detects multiple bit MB , check bit CB , and data bit DB errors, and the latter two are corrected by Exclusive OR gate sets 36 and 20 respectively. The corrected data and check bits are written back into the RAM, from gates 20 and via buffer 46 respectively. Thus any errors which occur in the RAM are corrected, instead of being allowed to accumulate. Buffers 28 and 48 allow direct access to the CB part of the RAM and the error correcting circuitry for maintenance.
