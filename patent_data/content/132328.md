# Probe cable assemblies.

## Abstract
A probe cable assembly for use in connecting a monitor ing instrument to an electronic system under test comprises a sheet form cable having an instrument end, a probe end and an auxiliary interconnect end. A probe element 50 having a plu rality of terminals is secured to the cable at the probe end thereof and is capable of fitting in a multiple terminal recepta cle of the system under test. An auxiliary receptable 40 cap able of receiving a multiple terminal electronic component from the system under test and having a plurality of terminals is also secured to the cable. A first group of conductors 16 of the cable extends between the instrument end 14 of the cable and the auxiliary interconnect end and terminates at the auxiliary interconnect end in an array corresponding to the ar rangement of the terminals of the auxiliary receptacle. A sec ond group 20 of conductors extends between the terminals of the auxiliary receptacle and corresponding terminals of said probe element. The cable is folded to bring the terminations of the first group of conductors into registry with the terminals of the auxiliary receptacle so that conductors of the first group are connected both to predetermined terminals of the auxiliary receptacle and to corresponding terminals of the probe ele ment.
