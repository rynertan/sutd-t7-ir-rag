## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, more particularly to control circuits included in a semiconductor memory device which is preferably fabricated as a programmable read only memory PROM . Various types of semiconductor memory devices hereinafter also called simply as memories have been put into practical use. The present invention mainly refers to a PROM. In a usual PROM, a bit selection, word selection, and read operation are achieved under a power source voltage of V A PROM is usually supplied for commercial sale in a standard one chip package. Therefore, the number of input output pins is limited. Because of this, a pin may often have to be commonly used as a terminal for two or more different input output sinals. Such common use of a pin poses no problem if the input output signals have the same voltage levels. In one example, described in document US A 4 319 341, there is suggested a method for compensating insufficiencies in the flow of programming current that may occur owing to losses through various circuits in the current path. However, there is a problem if a pin commonly used as an input terminal for both a program control voltage V In such a case, a switching circuit must be employed so as to prevent malfunctions in the constant current source which drives the program circuits connected to the common use pin. A thyristor switching circuit for applying the programming voltage from a control input is described in EP A 19381. In any case, the switching circuit operates to transfer the desired program control voltage V There is, however, a problem with the memory in that undesired channel leakage in the transistor comprising the constant current source often occurs, resulting in erroneous operation. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device including therein a switching circuit which can overcome the above mentioned problem. The above object is attained by a semiconductor memory device comprising a plurality of bit lines a plurality of word lines memory cells connected at cross points between the bit lines and word lines program circuits connected to the bit lines respectively and each being operative to write data to the memory cell when the corresponding bit line is selected a constant current source having a transistor for supplying a write current to the program circuit corresponding to the memory cell selected by the bit line a source of power supply voltage Vcc for operating the constant current source a control terminal for receiving, during the write operation, a program control voltage V The present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein As previously mentioned, the present invention relates to a switching circuit. Therefore, first the location of a switching circuit in a PROM will be clarified. Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a prior art PROM of a junction shorting type. In this figure, reference numerals 11 indicate bit lines, 12 word lines, and 13 memory cells arranged at each cross point of the bit line and the word line. The data of each memory cell 13 is not erasable once a write operation is achieved therein. The desired memory cell 13 is selected by selecting the corresponding bit line 11 by means of a bit decoder 14 2 and selecting the corresponding word line 12 by means of a word decoder 15. To these bit and word decoders, bit address AD The above operation is performed under a read mode and energized by a power source having a voltage of V The program circuit 21 is formed as a Darlington circuit so that the program current of 120 mA can flow therethrough. In this case, since a base current must be supplied to a first stage transistor of transistors comprising the Darlington circuit, a so called constant current source 23 is employed therefor. The constant current source 23 is made active only during the write operation mode. That is, the source 23 is not activated until the program control voltage V As previously mentioned, the control terminal 25 is a common terminal for selectively receiving the program control voltage V Thus, the program control voltage V Entering now into the essential point of the prior art shown in Fig. 1, under the read operation mode, a line 35 is charged up to about the V Such an erroneous operation cannot theoretically be induced in the program circuit 21, because the transistor 36 is supposed to be off, during the read operation mode, with a Zener voltage of, for example 6 V by a Zener diode 37. However, in actuality, the transistor 36 is often turned on unintentionally during the read operation mode. Thus, the previously mentioned control circuits to which the present invention is concerned are specifically the program circuits 21, the constant current source 23, and the switching circuit 24. Of these, the circuits 21 and the source 23 are already known, for example, in Fig. 4 of U.S. Patent 4,319,341. Regarding the constant current source 23, the transistor 36 is preferrably formed with a lateral PNP structure. If the transistor 36 is so formed, there is a possibility that the transistor 36 will be unintentionally turned on during the read operation mode. The reason for this is as follows. In an insulation layer formed on the base region of the lateral PNP transistor 36, impurities ion may originally be included therein or externally injected thereinto after formation of the insulation layer. Such impurities may often change the conduction type at the surface of the base region to a P type, in which it is considered that the impurities of ion are charged at the upper side of the insulation layer, while the impurities of ion are charged at the bottom side thereof. Therefore, a P type channel attracted by impurities of ion is created in the surface of the base region. It should be noted that the lateral PNP transistor 36 is advantageous for simply constructing the constant current source 23. The formation of such a P type channel makes the transistor 36 seemingly on. The thus formed channel is represented in Fig. 1 by the broken line 36 . This phenomena is usually called channel leakage . In order to avoid channel leakage, in the prior art, the insulation layer is covered by an emitter electrode, which insulation layer is formed on the base region. Since the emitter electrode is maintained at the power source voltage level of V The prior art way for avoiding channel leakage, however, has a disadvantage. This will be explained in reference to Figs. 2A to 3B. Figure 2A is a plan view of a lateral PNP transistor with an emitter electrode for avoiding channel leakage. Figure 2B is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2B 2B in Fig. 2A. Figure 3A is a plan view of a lateral PNP transistor with a usual emitter electrode. Figure 3B is a cross sectional view taken along the line 3B 3B in Fig. 3A. The concerned transistor 36 in Fig. 1 has a plan view and a cross sectional view shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, respectively. In Figs. 2A and 2B, particular attention should be paid to an emitter electrode EE In Figs. 2A and 3A, hatchings are employed to illustrate not cross sections, as usual, but to distinguish conductive lines and other members. The electrode EE is wider than a usual emitter electrode EE of Figs. 3A and 3B and covers the base region B. Thus, channel leakage can be prevented. In these figures, reference symbol IL denotes the insulation layer mentioned hereinbefore, C1 a first collector region, C2 a second collector region, CE1 a first collector electrode, and CE2 a second collector electrode. The disadvantage of the prior art is that, as clear from Figs. 2A and 2B, the employment of such a wide emitter electrode EE impedes realization of a highly integrated memory. That is, the collector electrodes CE1 and CE2 of Figs. 2A and 2B must be positioned far enough from the adjacent emitter electrode EE to prevent electric shorting between these electrodes CE1, CE2 and EE. In this regard, the transistor 36 occupies a considerably large area in the memory. In any case, to overcome the aforesaid problem, the prior art requires the use of such a large scale transistor 36 which often induces erroneous operation in the program circuits 21. To make matter worse, such a transistor 36 is necessary for each bit line, therefore impeding the degree of integration of the memory. Figure 4 is a circuit diagram of a principle of a switching circuit included in the memory according to the present invention. In Fig. 4, such a switching circuit 44 corresponds to the prior art switching circuit 24 shown in Fig. 1. Other members 23, 25, and 35 are identical to the constant current source, control terminal, and line, respectively. The switching circuit 44 includes therein a switching element 41 which receives, at its input side, the power source voltage V Figure 5 is a detailed circuit diagram of the switching circuit 44 of Fig. 4 and its neighboring control circuits. In this figure, the switching element 41 of Fig. 4 is formed by, for example an output side transistor 52, as illustrated therein. Thus, the transistor 52 and an input side transistor 51 together with the voltage detecting element are constructed, as a whole, in the form of a thyristor. Here, it should be noted that the thyristor structure is not intentionally formed, but necessarily results from the above mentioned transistor arrangement. There is no reason for intentionally introducing such a thyristor. The voltage detecting element 43 Fig. 4 is made of the Zener diode 37. The Zener diode 37 is not newly employed, but is one removed from the constant current source 23 of Fig. 1, which Zener voltage is, for exmaple 6 V. Thus, no Zener diode similar to that of the constant current source 23 in Fig. 1 is found in the corresponding constant current source 23 in Fig. 5. It is, necessary first to turn on the transistor 51 so as to turn on the transistor pair 51 and 52. Here, the transistor 51 can be turned on if a trigger current flows from the control terminal 25 via the emitter and base of the transistor 51 and the Zener diode 37 to the ground. However, during the read operation mode, the transistor 51 cannot be turned on, and the input control signal S Such a circumstance as mentioned just above is equivalent to the circumstance, under the same mode in Fig. 1 where only the junction capacitor 34 of the diode 31 is electrically effective viewed from the control terminal 25, in which one end of the capacitor 34 is maintained, via the Schottky barrier diode 32, at the power source voltage level of V A similar circumstance is exhibited in the switching circuit 24 Fig. 1 and the switching circuit 44 Figs. 4 and 5 , but there is a difference that, with the use of the prior art switching circuit 24, the transistor 36 is often unintentionally turned on due to the aforesaid channel leakage, since the power source voltage V The input side transistor 51 to be connected to the control terminal 25 is preferably fabricated as a lateral PNP transistor, as is the transistor 36 . Further, the lateral PNP transistor 51 is preferably formed to have the enlarged emitter electrode as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B so as to prevent channel leakage. It should be noted that the employment of such a lateral PNP transistor 51 having an enlarged emitter electrode does not cause a problem in the integration of the memory. This is because there is only one transistor 51 in the memory. It should be noted that the above mentioned matters do not apply to the transistor 52, because it is an NPN type transistor. On the other hand, during the write operation mode, the high level program voltage V When the transistor 52 is turned on, the parasitic capacitor 33 is charged up to the power source voltage level of V It should be understood from the above explanations that it does not matter if the channel leakage is induced in each transistor 36 because each transistor 36 is guaranteed to be off during the read operation mode. Consequently, it is not necessary to form each transistor 36 as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B. They can be formed as shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. This makes it possible to reduce the size of each transistor 36 . As explained above, the problem of malfunctions in the memory, especially during the read operation mode, can be overcome merely by introducing the transistors 51 and 52 and several resistors into the switching circuit. Also, a highly integrated PROM can be obtained, because each transistor 36 can be reduced in size, as mentioned above, compared with the usual corresponding transistor 36.
