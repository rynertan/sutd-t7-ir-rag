# A process for the construction of a composite tube comprising a metal tube, in particular a copper tube, and a cladding of deformable foam material.

## Abstract
A process is provided for the construction of a com posite tube comprising a metal tube 1 , in particular a tube of cooper, and a cladding 2 of tubular form into which the said tube 1 is inserted, the material of the said cladding 2 being constituted by a deformable foam material, in par ticular foam rubber, characterised by the fact that it com prises at least a first phase in which a section of said cladding 2 of predetermined length is disposed in a con figuration with its axis substantially rectilinear, a second phase in which a fluid under pressure is fed from a first end of the said cladding 2 to the interior thereof, whilst at the other end there is introduced one end of the said tube in such a way as to cause, by the action of the said fluid under pressure, a radial deformation of the said cladding, and a third phase in which the said copper tube 1 is introduced axially into the interior of the said cladding 2 whilst it is deformed radially.
