# Blends of polyetherimide and rubber modified vinyl aromatic polymers.

## Abstract
Disclosed are blends of a a polyetherimide and b a rubber modified vinyl aromatic polymer. Depending upon the particular rubber modified vinyl aromatic polymer used in preparing the blends, one or more of the properties of impact strength, heat distortion temperature, flexural properties and tensile properties of the blends are improved over those associated with the polyetherimide component alone or with the rubber modified vinyl aromatic polymer alone.
