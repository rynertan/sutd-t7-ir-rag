# Combine harvester.

## Abstract
A combine harvester comprising an engine, a traction drive transmission 31 , a header 12 , and a threshing and separating mechanism 9 , the combine harvester further comprising a machine throughput control system. This sys tem is comprising a machine loading control loop 37, 62, 61, 38, 39, 41, 31 operable to produce a signal representative of machine loading, a grain loss control loop 44, 45, 36, 38, 39, 41, 31 operable to produce a signal representative of grain. A grain loss controller 46 is continuously operable to establish a causal relationship between machine loading and grain loss, the machine loading signal, the causal relationship cur rent with that machine loading signal, and a reference loss signal being applied to the grain loss controller 46 to derive a reference machine loading signal therefrom. Means 38 are provided for algebraically summing the representative machine loading signal and the reference machine loading signal to produce a machine loading error signal which is used to control machine throughput.
