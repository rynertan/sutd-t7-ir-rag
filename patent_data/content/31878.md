# Paper cassette and copier therewith.

## Abstract
A xerographic copier has an exchangeable, multifunction paper cassette, the cassette functioning as a paper supply, exit tray and single sheet bypass entry station. The cassette is held at a small angle to the vertical and includes a lower end wall 73 , side walls 84, 85 and upper wall 74 spaced from the end wall to leave a gap which exposes the top sheet of a supply stack to paper feed roller means. Paper is fed, one sheet at a time, to a paper path which includes a transfer station and a hot roll fusing station. This paper path traverses a loop, such that the finished copy comes to rest on the wall 74 , of the cassette. At the lower end of the wall 74 includes a movable paper gate 49 which, when closed, allows multiple copies to be stacked before removal by the operator. If the operator wishes to copy in the bypass mode, a single sheet is inserted onto the wall 74 , and the gate 49 is opened, allow ing the lower edge of the bypass sheet to be interposed on top of the top sheet of the paper supply stack against paper regis tering stops 89, 90 . This bypass sheet is used as the next sheet in a copy process. Removal of the cassette, or move ment of the paper gate to its open position, controls an interimage erase station of the copier to erase for the longest paper which can be used in the copier.
