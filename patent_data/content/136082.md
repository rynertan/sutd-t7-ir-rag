# TEMPERATURE STABLE ARCUATE BUBBLE GRAVITY SENSOR MOUNT

## Abstract
A temperature stable apparatus for mounting an arcuate, glass, enclosed electrolytic bubble gravity sensor 20 utilises epoxy cement having a low temperature coefficient of ex pansion for bonding an end face 40 of a post 30 having a temperature coefficient of expansion equal to that of glass to the centre of the glass enclosure 21 of the sensor, and the other end of the post to the centre of a rectangular aluminium plate 32 , such that the longitudinal axis 31 of the post is orthogonal to the plate and to the plane of the arcuate axis 22 of the enclosure, and such, that a chord 41 connecting the ends of the arcuate axis is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the plate.
