# ALUMINUM REDUCTION CELL ELECTRODE

## Abstract
The invention is directed to cathode modules comprised of refractory hard metal materials, such as TiBâ‚‚, for an electrolytic cell for the reduction of alumina wherein the modules may be installed and replaced during operation of the cell and wherein the structure of the cathode modules is such that the refractory hard metal materials are not subjected to externally applied forces or rigid constraints.
