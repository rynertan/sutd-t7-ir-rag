# ROAD MILLING OR CUTTING MACHINE

## Abstract
A road milling or cutting attachment adapted to be mounted on the boom of a hydraulic machine comprises a frame, a road surface cutting member rotatably mounted in the frame and a low speed, high torque hydraulic motor directly coupled to the cutting member. Preferably the cutting member is formed of at least two arcuate parts detachably secured to mounting flanges on a drive shaft by detachable securing members, the frame having openings permitting access to the securing members to enable the cutting members to be readily mounted on and detached from the shaft. Preferably a portion of the frame is detach able to enable axial removal of the drive shaft and permit access to the shaft bearings.
