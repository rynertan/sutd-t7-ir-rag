# Device for digging up tuberous plants, for example beets.

## Abstract
A device for digging up tuberous plants, for example beets, comprising pairs of lifting members formed by driven shafts 6 slanting towards one another and being provided at the lower ends with lifting bodies 7 , wherein each lifting body has a pressing face extending, viewed in an axial direction, along a helically curved line relative to the rotary axis, such that the lifting body will gradually penetrate into the soil owing to the helical shape and the trailing position. The different pairs of lifting bodies are driven with a relative time lag to reduce the lateral reactive force on the machine and in each pair the lifting bodies operate in synchronism so that each time only one lifting body strikes the tuber. Flexible elements 18 are mounted above the lifting bodies 7 .
