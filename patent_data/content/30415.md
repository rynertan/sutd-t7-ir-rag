# Power steering gear with adjustable valve positioning pin.

## Abstract
An adjustable guide pin 27 arrangement for an inte gral power steering gear is provided. A reciprocating valve 20 is provided within the piston 11 of the gear to selec tively distribute pressurized fluid to the end of the piston for steering action. An input shaft 25 engages the valve to move the valve providing the input signal. An output pinion 15 engages the piston along the side. The guide pin 27 is mounted in the piston and has two pairs of tapered flat guide surfaces 35, 35a 36, 36a at its distal end. One pair of guide surfaces engages a corresponding tapered slot 28 in the valve for each adjusted position. Screw threads 31 are provided to adjustably move the pin inward for less clearance and outward for more clearance between the guide surfaces and the sides of the slot. The taper of the distal end of the pin is approximately 2 2¹ ₂ . Each quarter turn preferably provides a differential clear ance of approximately .001 inch. A tool engaging slot 40 on the head of the pin provides for easy visual adjustment during assembly.
