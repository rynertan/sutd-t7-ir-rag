# Method of and apparatus for monitoring gaseous pollutants.

## Abstract
Apparatus for monitoring gaseous pollutants e.g. on a chemical plant produces two infra red laser beams having different wavelengths one corresponding to an absorption line of the gas to be monitored, the other being a reference which are modulated with different frequencies or phases, and then combined into a single scanning beam. The scan ning beam is continuously displaced angularly so as to scan the area to be monitored. A portion of the beam is returned to the apparatus by scattering or reflection, and is measured. By correlating this with the direction of the beam, a plan of the monitored area superimposed with a continuously updated indication of the amount of gas can be displayed e.g. on a VDU.
