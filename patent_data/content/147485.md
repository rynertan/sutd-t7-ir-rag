# Condensing instrument for packing and condensing in connection with placement of dental composite resin restorative materials.

## Abstract
Condensing instruments are used for packing and condensing in connection with placement of dental compo site resin restorative materials. These instruments are manu factured in metal or plastic material. Some composite resins however, contain hard particles and require a relatively large condensing pressure which causes abrasion of superficial fragments of prior art metal instruments. These fragments are confined in the restorative material and causes discol ouration, often after oxidation. Plastic instruments quickly loose their surface finish, which may render it impossible to perform an adequate condensation. In order to provide an instrument which does not cause discolouration and which guarantees a durable function, at least one functional member 4 and or 5 of the instrument consists of a metal alloy having a coating 6 and or 7 of ceramic material which provides the working surface 8 and or 9 of the functional member.

## Description
CONDENSING INSTRUMENT FOR PACKING AND CONDENSING IN CONNECTIONWITH PLACEMENT OF DENTAL COMPOSITE RESIN RESTORATIVE MATERIALS.The present invention relates to a condensing instrument for packing and condensing in connection with placement of dental composite resin restorative materials.To day s composite resin materials have a potty or paste like consistency and thus, require no essential packing and condensing pressure. This means that the packing and condensing instrument may be manufactured in metal or plastic material without great demands upon surface hardness. Composite resins under development, such as those defined in the US PS 4 381 918, contain hard particles and require a relatively large condensing pressure which causes abrasion of superficial fragments of prior art metal instruments.These fragments are confined in the restorative material and causes discolouration, often after oxidation.The use of plastic instruments also gives rise to certain problems, since such instruments quickly loose their surface finish. The rough surface thereby appearing is unfavourable as the composite resin thereby sticks to the surface to an extent which may render it impossible to perform an adequate condensation. The plastic instruments are inferior to metal instruments with regard to the resistance to heat treatment in connection with normal sterilizing procedures.The object of the present invention is to eliminate these drawbacks and provide an instrument which does not cause discolouration and which guarantees a durable function. This is arrived at according to the invention substantially while at least one functional member of the instrument consists of a metal alloy having a coating of ceramic material which provides the working surface of the functional member.The provision of a coating of ceramic material on the functional member consisting of a metal alloy eliminates the risk of discolouration and the pre requisites for a durable function of the instrument are provided. Thereby, the instrument also acquires a high resistance to chemical and thermal action in connection with normal sterilizing or desinfecting procedures.The invention will be further described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which fig. 1 is a side view of the condensing instrument according to the invention fig. 2 is a section through the end portion of the functional member of the instrument fig. 3 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the functional member of the instrument fig. 4 illustrates a section of a part of the functional member with a ceramic insert and fig. 5 illustrates a section of a part of the functional member with a ceramic insert of an alternative design.The condensing instrument shown in fig. 1 is intended for packing and condensing in connection with placement of such dental composite resin restorative materials that require a relatively large condensing pressure. The condensing instrument comprises a handle member 1 of metal or plastic. The handle member 1 has two threaded bores 2 and 3 into which functional members 4 and 5 are tightened. Alternatively, the condensing instrument may consist of a unit, wherein one or more functional members 4 and or 5 are integrated.In order to eliminate the risk of discolouration and provide the pre requisites for a durable function of the instrument, said functional members 4 and 5 are made of a metal alloy and provided with coatings 6 and 7 of ceramic material defining the working surfaces 8 and 9 of said members 4 and 5.One example of manufacturing a condensing instrument according to fig. 1 is that on an amalgam condensing instrument, the end surfaces of the functional members 4 and 5 of stainless steel are ground clean with a coarse stone, e.g. a carborundum stone. A porcelain paste of low fusing porcelain or glass, e.g. Steeles Super Stain or Micro Bond Natural Ceramic Howmedica Inc. is placed on the ground surface and thereafter, the instrument is placed in a furnace at the temperature required for sintering for about 15 minutes. Hereby, the porcelain paste is baked on the functional members 4 and 5. If the porcelain surface after baking is not sufficiently even, said surface may be ground planar and if needed, another heat treatment is performed to provide glossy working surfaces 8 and 9.It is especially advantageous if the instrument is heated to the sintering temperature and thereafter cooled before the porcelain is applied. Hereby, an advantageous oxidation of the instrument is provided, whereby the porcelain obtains good adhesion of the metal surface and its oxide layer.In order to eliminate or at least reduce the risk of fall off of the ceramic coating 6, 7, e.g. in connection with heat treatment of the instrument for sterilizing or desinfecting procedures, the functional members 4, 5 preferably consist of a metal alloy having a thermal expansion coefficient substantially corresponding with that of the ceramic coating 6, 7.The ceramic coating 6, 7 may be of different types, preferably glass or porcelain, whereby low fusing porcelain of glaze type is most suitable. A preferred type of ceramic coating 6, 7 can be described as a low fusing feldspathic porcelain with a nominal composition as follows 68.64 SiO2, 13.76 A12O3, 0.36 CaO, 13.46 K2O, 2.29 Na2O and 1.49 Li2O. However, ceramic coatings 6, 7 can vary considerably in their composition and can be applied by flame spray methods, plasma spray methods and or conventional sintering methods as previously described.The functional members 4, 5 of the instrument may consist of different types of metal alloys, preferably stainless steel, nickel chromium based alloys and or cobolt chromium or titanium based alloys are used. Especially suitable in this case is the alloy VITALLIUMQ, since the use thereof provides good possibilities for a rigid and strong construction of the instrument. Furthermore, VITALLIUMpermits good adhesion of the porcelain paste intended for this matter, preferablyMicro Bond Natural Ceramic Howmedica Inc. . The working surfaces 8, 9 of the ceramic material 6, 7 are preferably planar or somewhat convex. Hereby, the composite resin sticks or adheres less to the instrument. Reduced adhesion or tendency to sticking is also achieved if the working surfaces 8, 9 are finished and or baked to a high polish.To facilitate the control of whether the ceramic coatings 6, 7 have fallen off from the functional members 4, 5 or not, said coatings 6, 7 are preferably opaque.The risk of loosening of the ceramic coatings 6, 7 may be reduced while the thickness of the coatings is about one millimeter or less and the risk of loosening of the edge portions of the coatings may be reduced by chamfering the outer edges 10 limiting the working surfaces 8, 9.The ceramic coatings 6, 7 may be applied onto the functional members 4, 5 as is shown in fig. 2 or e.g. as is shown in fig. 3. In the latter embodiment, the ceramic coatings 6, 7 extend in behind the expanded end portions of the functional members 4, 5. There are other alternative embodiments of the instrument and the members forming part thereof. Thus, the instrument may comprise only one functional member 4 or 5, the functional member may consist of other metal alloys, e.g. alloys comprising nickel and chromium or titanium alloys, the ceramic coating may comprise other materials than glass or porcelain, e.g. zirconium oxide, quartz or aluminium oxide, preferably sintered to high density. The ceramic part 6, 7 can also be a type of ceramic insert, which could take the forms as illustrated in fig. 4 and 5. The ceramic insert can be attached to the functional member or handle member by use of adhesive cements and or mechanical retention.
