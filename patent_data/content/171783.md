# MODULE BOARD AND MODULE USING THE SAME AND METHOD OF TREATING THEM

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a module board for a computer and a module using the same, and more particu larly to a module board and a module having a surface pattern suitable for high density packaging. To bond a repair wire 12 onto a technical exchange pad 5 , a wire bonder is normally used, but a fixed or more interval must be provided between an LSI chip and the technical exchange pad 5 so as to secure a working area. Depending on the direction of bonding, however, a required interval changes substantially. The invention is characterized in that junction pads 6 are installed to provide a module board and a module having a surface pattern capable of restricting the direction of bond ing to one direction.
