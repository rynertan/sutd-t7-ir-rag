# Tube which can be axially stacked.

## Abstract
Tube which can be axially stacked and is able to sustain bobbins that can be stacked, one against another, at least for doubling and twisting operations, whereby said tube can be manipulated by hand and comprises outside means 12 which are at least partially elastic radially and disposed circumferentially, and which bear interference means 19 and are positioned lengthwise in respect of end face and positioning means 111 , and which extend radially out wards, being positioned at one end of the tube, and whereby said tube also comprises inner circumferential seating means 20 positioned in respect of the end 211 of the tube 10 and cooperating with circumferential lodgement means 21 , and whereby said at least partially radially elastic outside means 12 cooperate with said inner circumferential seating means 20 for the reciprocal fixture and positioning of two axially stacked tubes 10 , and whereby there are axial guide means 113 and it is possible to insert a radially guiding and tensioning element 23 between one tube 10 and the other 110 .
