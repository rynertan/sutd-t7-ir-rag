# Automatic document feeder.

## Abstract
An automatic document feeder comprising a document supply section for supplying documents one by one toward a document platen, a belt feed section for transferring a sup plied document to a predetermined position on the document platen to enable an image forming operation, and a document discharge section for discharging onto a document discharge tray a document fed from the belt feed section upon comple tion of the image forming operation, is attached so that it is upwardly turnable with respect to the document platen so as to enable manual and automatic document settings to be made selectively. Further, the automatic document feeder is designed to discriminate between manual and automatic document setting modes and to detect the presence or absence of a document at a predetermined position in the automatic document feeder when the automatic document setting mode is selected. The automatic document feeder is driven with a predetermined timing for the setting of docu ments.
