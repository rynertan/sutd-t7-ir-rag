# Dehydration of alcohols.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a continuous process for producing substantially anhydrous alcohols from aqueous solutions thereof by distilling a mixture of aqueous alcohol and an entrainer FED to a drying column withdrawing an azeotrope as a distillate and continuously recovering anhydr ous alcohol with less than 0.1 by weight of water from the base of the drying column. The improvement resides in feed ing the distillate to a condenser and introducing a the con densate therefrom in a substantially non turbulent state into a decanter at a point close to the interface between the aqueous and organic phases present therein and b a specified amount of water, which is less than 0.25 volumes per volume of the anhydrous alcohol recovered, into the drying column at a point adjacent to that at which the organic hydrocarbon phase is returned as reflux.
