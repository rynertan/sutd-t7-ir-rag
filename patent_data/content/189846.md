# CONNECTOR FOR SEMI RIGID COAXIAL CABLE

## Abstract
An electrical connector for terminating semi rigid coa xial cable 1 comprises a collet type, threaded sleeve 13 having an annular base or flange 15 extending radially outward at one end through which a length of semi rigid coaxial cable is drawn with the cable centre conductor 3 protruding through the flange. The sleeve 13 comprises a plurality of slots 35 extending from the flange length wise to the rearward end of the sleeve. A standard threaded nut 31 is tightened on the sleeve 13 against the flange 15 . As the nut 31 bottoms out against the flange, the sleeve is compressed against the cable outer conductor 7 providing retention of the cable and electrical contact between the cable outer conductor 7 and the connector. Electrical connection between the center conductor and an electrical circuit can be provided by a socket 19 soldered into a printed circuit board.
