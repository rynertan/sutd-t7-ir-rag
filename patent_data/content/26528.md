# Detergent compositions.

## Abstract
A laundry detergent composition providing cleaning and softening of textiles comprises an anionic surfactant, a water insoluble di C₁₀ C₂₆ tertiary amine, and a water soluble cationic compound which may be a mono C₁₀ C₁₈ alkyl primary, secondary or tertiary amine, or a water soluble salt thereof or a water soluble mono C₈ C₁₀ alkyl quaternary ammonium compound. A smectite clay serving as an additional textile softening agent and a detergent builder salt are preferred components of the granular form of the composition which may contain other conventional detergent ingredients.
