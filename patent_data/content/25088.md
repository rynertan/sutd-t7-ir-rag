## Description
TITLE Improved Solvent Developable Photoresist Film TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to photopolymerizable resist film and more particularly to such film in which multiple layers of photopolymerizable composition are present. BACKGROUND ART U.S. Patent 3,469,982 discloses a negative acting photopolymerizable film resist in which a photopolymerizable layer is sandwiched between a temporary support film and a temporary cover film.This film has gained widespread usage in the manufacture of printed circuits in which the cover film is removed, the photopolymerizable layer is laminated by heat and pressure to the surface, e.g., copper, of a substrate to be permanently modified, the layer is imagewise exposed to actinic radiation, the film support is removed, the unexposed areas of the layer are removed by solvent washout development , and the resultant bared area of the copper surface is permanently modified, such as by etching or deposition of metal. The photopolymerizable layer has to be nontacky so as to be handleable and not cold flow and yet has to have sufficient adhesion to the substrate surface and integrity toughness to survive solvent development. Achievement of this adhesion is not instantaneous upon lamination but increases with time.A hold up time of about thirty minutes or more and sometimes heating the layer may be required for sufficient adhesion that the support film can be removed without causing separation of the layer from the substrate surface. This holding time has the disadvantage of delaying the next processing step toward the manufacture of the printed circuit. Attempts to decrease the hold up time and to increase adhesion by changes in the composition of the photopolymerizable layer have detracted from other properties of the layer, e.g., reduced integrity during solvent development and or reduced resistance to plating solutions. Changes in the compositions of the photopolymerizable layer to increase its ability to withstand solvent development tend to reduce adhesion of the layer to the substrate surface while increasing adhesion to the support film, making it difficult to remove the support film without detaching the photopolymerizable layer from the substrate surface. Superimposed over these needs for faster and greater adhesion and greater integrity has been the desire for thinner photopolymerizable layers for economy, which increases the difficulty of satisfying these needs. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The present invention provides a process for making a thermoplastic photosensitive film resist which satisfies the needs of increased adhesion to the substrate surface with reduced hold up time, without sacrifice in integrity needed for the solvent development step, and at the same time, reduced layer thickness. More specifically, the process of the present invention involves changing the usual procedure of applying the photosensitive composition to the temporary support film to form a laminate of a layer of the composition on the support film, which layer is to be adhered eventually to a substrate surface.The change in the usual procedure is prior to applying the photosensitive composition to the support film, a second thermoplastic photosensitive composition is applied to the support film to form a laminate of a photosensitive layer on the support film and then the first mentioned photosensitive composition is applied to the exposed surface of the layer of the second photosensitive composition, the layer of second photosensitive composition having a lesser adhesion to the support film than the adhesion of the layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition to the copper surface and a greater adhesion to the layer of the firstmentioned photosensitive composition than to the support film. The multiple thermoplastic photosensitive layers of the resultant photoresist film can each be considered partial layers of the combined thickness of the photosensitive layers. A cover film can be. laminated to the exposed surface of the layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition. In the resultant laminate, the adhesion of the cover film to the layer of firstmentioned photosensitive composition is less than the adhesion of the support film to the layer of the second photosensitive layer to enable the cover film to be stripped from the layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition without layer separation or separation of the support film from the layer of second photosensitive composition.The layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition, however, has greater adhesion to a substrate surface of copper than the adhesion of the layer of second photosensitive composition to the support film to enable the support f ilm to be stripped away without causing the partial layers to separate from each other or from the substrate surface. The layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition can have improved instant adhesion and high adhesion to the substrate surface by selection of appropriate composition for this layer and still survive solvent development by virtue of the layer of second photosensitive composition having greater resistance to solvent development. While the layer of the first mentioned photosensitive composition has high adhesion to the substrate surface, the layer of second photosensitive composition has relatively low adhesion to the support film to permit the support film to be easily stripped away without detaching the photosensitive layer from the substrate surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND BEST MODE The components used in the process of the invention will first be described and then details of each component will be described, each with reference to the current commercially available type of thermoplastic photosensitive film resist, namely photopolymerizable film resist. Che layer of second photopolymerizable photosensitive composition or simply, the second layer may be applied by conventional means to the support film from a solution and is then dried. The layer of the first mentioned photopolymerizable photosensitive composition, or simply the first layer may be applied as a solution or preformed layer to the second layer by conventional means to obtain high adhesion between these layers. Preferably, a cover film is laminated to the bare surface of the first layer so that the first and second photopolymerizable photosensitive layers are sandwiched between and protected by the support film and cover film. Upon removal of the cover film, the uncovered bare surface of the first layer can be laminated to a substrate surface and processed to form a resist image on the surface. The first layer in contact with the substrate surface of a substance, usually copper, has high adhesion to the surface as well as to the second layer. The second layer preferably has a lower adhesion to the support film than would the first layer if it had originally been applied to the support film. This makes it easier to remove the support film without removing the first layer from the substrate or surface of the second layer from the first layer. The second layer may be considered a release layer for the support film of the photoresist film.This layer stays with the first layer, however, upon stripping away of the support film. As such, the second layer plays an important part of the process to form a resist image on the substrate surface. The second layer can also protect the first layer during the solvent development step and subsequent processing.The second layer also supplements the thickness of the first layer to prevent or minimize mushrooming that could occur in electroplating of the substrate surface. The first and second layers have a similar photo speed and are developable with the same solvent so that the complete thickness of the first and second layers can be washed away in a single development step to leave a resist image of both layers on the substrate surface. The combination of first and second layers is more effective than a single layer of the same total thickness and entire composition of these multiple layers. The thickness of the combination of layers will depend on the permanent modification to be used on the substrate surface. Generally, the etching resist image can be thinner than resist image for deposition of metal. In the latter case, the total thickness will generally be no greater than 0.06 mm.For etching, the total thickness will generally be no greater than 0.04 mm. and preferably, no greater than 0.03 mm. Generally, the layers will each comprise 10 to 90 of their combined thickness. Preferably, the second layer will comprise 20 to 60 of the combined thickness of the layers. Any of the support films and cover films known for use as such for a photoresist film can be used in the present invention. Preferably, the support film is polyethylene terephthalate and the cover film is polyethylene, both films being oriented for strength. The first and second photopolymerizable photosensitive layers preferably each comprise polymer binder, monomer, and photoinitiator and are dry to the touch. Typically, these components will comprise 40 to 90, 10 to 40, and 1 to 10 percent of the total weight of these three components. Each of these components can be a single ingredient or a plurality thereof to serve the intended function in the composition. The preferred binder is acrylic polymer, in which at least 40 of the weight of the binder is derived from one or more acrylic units, i.e., acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and esters and nitriles ther2 of. Examples of such polymers are polytmethyl methacrylate and copolymers and terpolymers thereof with acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, C2 C5 alkyl acrylates, styrene, and acrylonitrite. Styrene maleic anhydride and styrene butadiene, and poly vinylacetate , copolymers can also be used. High adhesion of the first layer to copper may be obtained by using a relatively low molecular weight binder that adheres to copper, the relative low molecular weight of the binder enabling the composition to conform to and form an intimate contact with the copper surface. Other ingredients in the composition may also contribute to this conformability.For example, the binder can be an acrylic polymer or mixture of acrylic polymers having an average molecular weight in the range of 20,000 to 125,000. The layer can also contain an additive such as benzotriazole which increases adhesion to copper, The same binder can be used in the second layer and its adhesion to the support film reduced by adding polycaprolactone to the second layer.Preferably, the binder is of substantially higher molecular weight higher intrinsic or inherent viscosity , e.g., greater than an average of 150,000, in the second layer so as to increase the integrity or toughness of the second layer. Instead of or in mixture with acrylic polymer as the binder in the second layer, polymers such as chlorinated rubber, butadiene acrylonitrile, and cellulose acetate butyrate polymers can be used. The monomer and photo initiator used in each of the layers are conventional ingredients.Examples of monomers are trimethylol propane traacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate and tetraethylene glycol diacrylate. Examples of photoinitiators are benzophenone and Michler s ketone and mixtures thereof, hexaarylbisimidazoles and leuco dyes. Other binder, monomer, and photoinitiator components that can be used in the present invention are those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,054,483. The photopolymerizable photosensitive layers may also contain other adjuvants, such as plasticizers, inhibitors and colorants. Preferably, the low molecular weight or non polymeric components of the first and second layers, principally monomer, photoinitiator and plasticizer, if any, are substantially the same in each layer and are present in substantially the same amount in each layer. This provides storage stability to the multi layer photoresist film because these are the diffusible components of the layers.The greater the similarity as set forth, the less the tendency of diffusion of components to occur, which would tend to erase property differences between layers. The property difference can then be established and maintained by relatively nondiffusible components such as the binder component being of higher molecular weight in the second layer. The negative acting multiple layer photoresist film of the present invention can be used in the same manner as the single layer film described in U.S. Patent 3,469,982. Other thermoplastic photosensitive layers can be used to make multi layer photoresist film according to the present invention in the same manner as the photopolymerizable compositions described hereinbefore. Photopolymerizable compositions are a specie of photohardenable compositions, i.e., compositions which increase in molecular weight upon exposure to actinic radiation, and are therefore negative working. The thermoplastic photohardenable compositions, generally, are useful in the present invention. Another specie of photohardenable composition is the photocrosslinkable composition, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,526,504. In this type reaction, the actinic radiation causes polymer crosslinking or dimerization, one crosslink for each photon of radiation, as distinguished from the chain propagating type of reaction involved for photopolymerizable compositions. Positive working thermoplastic photosensitive layers can also be used in the present invention. Examples of positive working layers are those that are of photosolubilizable compositions such as the polymers having pendant recurring o quinone diazide groups as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,837,860 ane the desensitizable compositions such as the compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,778,270 wherein the exposed area of the layer is rendered non crosslinkable to treatment by ammonia fumes the ammonia crosslinks the unexposed area of the layer and in Belgian Patent 852,517 wherein exposure to a certain wavelength of radiation renders the exposed area of the layer non reactive to subsequent radiation which then polymerizes the originally unexposed area of the layer. The same properties, e.g., adhesion and integrity, can be amplified in first and second layers, respectively, of these other thermoplastic photosensitive layers, as in the case of the photopolymerizable layers. For example, the polymer component whether it be the binder or photosensitive component of these layers, can be of higher molecular weight in the second layer than in the first layer so as to give the second layer greater integrity. The first layer can contain benzotriazole. The use of the multi layer photoresist films of these other photosensitive layers as a resist will depend on the particular photosensitive compositions involved. The foregoing mentioned patents U.S. Patents 3,778,270 and 3,837,860 andBelgian Patent 852,517 disclose the manner of use of such compositions, which are used in the same manner in the present invention. Examples of the present invention are as follows parts and percents are by weight unless otherwise indicated Example 1 This Example shows the preparation of a multiple layer photoresist film in accordance with the present invention. Two photoresist film elements are comprised of a photopolymerizable layer sandwiched between a 0.025mm polyethylene film. The photopolymerizable layer of one element, Element A, is 0.018mm thick and has the following composition Parts Component By WeightPoly methyl methacrylate , inh. vis. 0.21 35Poly methyl methacrylate , inh. vis. 1.37 20Trimethylolpropane triacrylate 35Triethylene glycol diacetate 8.5Michler s ketone 0.33Benzophenone 0.66Benzotriazole 0.1Solvent Red CI 109 0.45The photopolymerizable layer of the second element,Element B, is 0.03Emm thick and has the following composition Parts Component By WeightPoly methyl methacrylate , inh. vis. 0.21 34Poly methyl methacrylate , inh. vis. 1.37 22Pentaerythritol triacrylate 35Triethylene glycol diacetate 5 2 Tertiary butyl anthraquinone 3.5 2,2 Methylene bis 4 ethyl 6 tert butyl phenol 0.37Grasol Fast Brilliant Red BL 0.13 The polyethylene cover sheets are removed from a sample of Element A and Element B, and the uncovered photopolymerizable layer of each is laminated to a clean copper surface of a copper clad epoxy fiberglass board using a hot roll laminator where the rolls are heated to 75 850C and where the lamination rate is 12dm per minute.Sixty seconds after lamination the polyethylene t rephthalate support film is stripped from the laminated element. In the instance when Element A is used, the support film is difficult to remove indicating strong adhesion to both the copper surface and the support film. Such strong adhesion to the support film can cause detachment of small portions of the photopolymer layer particularly when the laminated film is imagewise exposed to actinic radiation. In the instance when Element B is used, the entire photopolymer layer is removed with the support film indicating the total lack of instant adhesion of the photopolymer to the copper surface. In an instance when Element B is laminated to copper and the support film is stripped from the laminated element after a prolonged thirty minute delay, the support film is easily removed with no indication of detachment. A two layer photopolymer element is prepared by removing the polyethylene cover sheets from a sample of Element A and a sample of ElementB and then laminating the two uncovered photopolymer layers together in surface to surface contact. The laminated two layer element is then placed on a flat surface with the Element A portion uppermost, and the polyethylene terephthalate support film is carefully removed from the layerA by slowly peeling tbe film back over itself C1800 angle .The uncovered surface layer A of the two layer element is then laminated to a cleaned copper surface as described above and sixty seconds after lamination the support film is easily removed from the laminated element with no photopolymerizable material adhered thereto indicating that the two layer element has the instant adhesion qualities of Element A with easy support film removal qualities of Element B, In use as a photoresist to make copper printed circuits, the two layer element has the advantageous lamination characteristics of Element A as well as processing characteristics of the more durable Element B.Example 2 This Example shows the preparation of a multiple layer photoresist film having a different composition. A first coating solution is prepared having the following composition. Components GramsMethyl methacrylate 96 ethyl acrylate 4 copolymer, inh. vis. 0.54 4960Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate 1760Trimethylolpropane triacrylate 880 2,2 Bis 2 chlorophenyl 4,4 ,5,5 tetraphenyl biimidazole 320Leuco Crystal Violet 56Benzotriazole 32Solvent Red 109 12Methanol 300Methylene chloride 11010The coating solution is coated on a 0.025mm thick polyethylene terephthalate film web and dried to give a dry coating thickness of 0.051mum. A 0.025mm thick polyethylene film is laminated to the dried coating and the laminated single layer element is stored as a roll. The polyethylene film is removed from a sample of the single layer element and the following second coating solution is overcoated on the photopolymerizable layer and dried. Components GramsCopolymer of methyl methacrylate 46 , acrylonitrile 9 , buta dine 148 and styrene 31 21Triethylene glycol dimetha crylate 4Trimethylolpropane triacrylate 2 2,2 Bis 2 chlorophenyl 4,4 ,5,5 tetraphenyl bimidazole 0.8Leuco Crystal Violet 0.14Benzotriazole 0.02Triisononyl trimellitate 0.5Methylene chloride 100The total dried two layer coating thickness is 0.062mm. The uncovered photopolymerizable surface of the two layer element is laminated to a clean copper surface of a 15x7.6cm copper clad, epoxy fiberglass board using a roll laminator of Example 1 but at room temperature. After removing the cover sheet from a sample of the single layer element, the uncovered photopolymerizable layer is similarly laminated to a cleaned copper clad board. The adhesive force, expressed in grams centimeter, of each photopolymer surface to the copper surface is measured using an Instrone Model TTB Tensil Tester instrument. by measuring the force to peel the photopolymer layer and support film back across and parallel to the top surface of the laminated support, i.e., about 1800C from the leading edge of the support. In an instance when the adhesive force is measured immediately after lamination, only 36 g cm are required to remove the singlelayer element from copper, whereas, greater than 790 g cm are required to remove the two layer element. In an instance when the adhesive force is measured one hour after lamination, the force required to remove the single layer increases to 154 g cm, however, for the two layer element only the support film is removed leaving both photopolymer layers firmly adhered to the copper substrate. A second sample of the two layer element is laminated to a copper substrate as in Example 1, is exposed for 40 sec. through a line image transparency i.e., having 0.051mum opaque lines separated by 0.051mum to actinic light using a Scannex9II Exposure Source Colight, Inc. inn., Minn. . After removal of the support film and development for 100 seconds in trichloroethylene in a RistonD Type C Processor, a resist image containing all lines of the original transparency is obtained. Instant adhesion of the two layer element can be further improved by replacing the copolymer and triisononyl trimellitate in the second coating solution with 21g of acrylonitrile 19 butyl acrylate 29 methyl methacrylate 508 metha crylic acid 2 copolymer, Clow M.W. and lg triethylene glycol diacetate. When the adhesion is measured immediately after lamination, only the support film is removed leaving both photopolymerizable layers adhered to the copper substrate. The properties of the photoresist film of this Example are unchanged after aging for thirty 30 days at 400C. Similar storage stability is present in the photoresist films of the remainingExamples. Example 3 This Example shows the preparation of an improved multiple layer photoresist film.

The uncovered photopolymerizable surface of the two layer element is laminated to the abrasively cleaned copper surface of a 18x23cm copper clad, epoxy fiberglass board using a Piston Model A24 hot roll laminator at a roll temp. of about 105 C. As inExample 2, the laminated element is imagewise exposed for fifty seconds, the support film removed, and the imaged element developed for eighty seconds to produce a resist image containing all the lines of the original transparency. The copper not covered by the resist image is removed by etching in 420 Be ferric chloride solution, the resulting image is rinsed and the resist image is removed from the protected copper image by washing with methylene chloride.When examined under magnification, the etched lines have sharp straight sides indicating no adhesion failure during the support film removal, development, or etching steps.Example 4 This example shows the tenting performance of a two layer resist compared to that of a single layer resist of equal composition.

Each laminated panel is irradiated conventionally with a high pressure mercury vapor lamp on both sides through a phototool to leave exposed photoresist tents over both sides of each hole. The polyethylene terephthalate film support is removed from each side of each panel and the panels are developed by removing unexposed resist areas with a methyl chloroform spray.None of the tents of either coating type are broken.The developed panels are next passed through a high pressure hot water spray t54 C to test the spray impact resistance of the tents The number of tents broken during spraying are tabulated as follows of Tents Broken in High Pressure SprayFilm 6.35mm 4.44mm 3.18mum 2mm lmm Two Layer 62 35 22 7 4Single Layer 94 82 70 24 6Substantially fewer tents ruptured when the two layer resist film was used as compared to the single layer film of essentially the same composition.

The inherent viscosities disclosed in theExamples are determined for a solution of 0.25g of polymer in 5m1 of chloroform at 200C using a No. 50Cannon Fenske viscometer. The inherent viscosities correspond to molecular weight approximately as follows Inherent Molecular Viscosity Weight 0.45 100,000 0.54 150,000 1.4 250,000 1.8 300,000 As many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claim.
