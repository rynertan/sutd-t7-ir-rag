# Microbially produced rennet, methods for its production and plasmids used for its production.

## Abstract
The production of microbial rennet by recombinant DNA techniques is disclosed also plasmid expression vectors for transfecting a microbial host for efficient expression of e.g. prorennin, rennin and preprorennin.
