# A semiconductor memory having multiple access.

## Abstract
An improved semiconductor memory, suitable for a video system, includes a memory cell array, a first access circuit operatively performing a write operation and a read operation to the memory cell array, and a second access circuit operatively peforming a read operation to the mem ory cell array in response to different groups of address signals from those applied to the first access circuit. The two access circuits can operate asynchronously and can simu taneously access the memory.
