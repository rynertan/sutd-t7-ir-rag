# SYSTEM AND METHOD OF PARTICULATING 4,4 METHYLENEBIS 2 CHLOROANILINE

## Abstract
A system 10 and method for producing a particulate MBOCA product including relatively uniformly sized gra nules. The system includes a pan granulator 68 , a dust hood 70 enclosing the granulator pan, and a blower 76 for circulating an air stream through the hood to carry away the heat of fusion of the granulation. Suitable drum charging apparatus has a filler tube 186, 188, 200 extendable into a drum 154 , a dust cup 182 covering the drum opening when the filler tube is inserted therein, and a vacuum for drawing air through the dust cup. Air displaced from the drum and product particles dispersed therein are therefore drawn into the vacuum for subsequent recovery of product particles. All the air in the system can be filtered before being discharged into the outside atmosphere.
