## Description
HERBICIDAL FORMULATIONS AND THEIR USE TO COMBAT WEEDS This invention relates to herbicidal formulations and more particularly to formulations wherein the herbicide is an acid, and to the use of such formulations as herbicides. Many known herbicides are acids, or acid derivatives.We have discovered a way of formulating and applying such herbicidal acids whereby increases in herbicidal activity, and sometimes other advantages, may be obtained. According to the present invention we provide a herbicidal acid formulation comprising a solution of a salt of a herbicidal acid with an organic amine containing at least 8 carbon atoms in an organic solvent, the formulation having a resistivity at 250C of 106 to 1010 preferably 107 to 109, ohm centimetres, and optionally containing a surfactant. We further provide a process for combating weeds which comprises applying to the weeds a formulation according to the invention in the form of electrically charged droplets. The invention further comprises certain novel herbicidal acid amine salts. Herbicidal acids for use in the invention may be of a wide range of different chemical types, including the following types A. Phenoxyalkanoic acids, eg. dichloroprop MCPB mecoprop dichlorprop 2,4,5 T.B. Aryloxyphenoxy allcanoic particularly propionic acids eg. clofop diclofop fluazifop and like compounds in which the ether linkage between the rings is replaced by a sulphur atom or NH group C. Diphenyl ethers, eg. acifluofen, fomesafen.D. Substituted benzoic acids, eg. dicamba, chloramben.The invention is of particular advantage for use with the herbicide glyphosate. Glyphosate is the approved common name for the compound N phosphonomethylglycine HOOC.CH2NH.CE2Po E 2 . This compound is the subject of US Patent SpecificationNo. 3799758, the disclosure of which Specification is incorporated herein by reference. Glyphosate is a broad spectrum herbicide, killing both grasses and broad leaved weeds, and being particularly effective on deep rooted perennial weed species. It is systemic, moving through the plant system, and is inactivated by the soil, so that subsequently planted crops are not affected by it. In comparison with other known broad spectrum soil inactivated herbicides eg. bipyridylium herbicides such as paraquat it has several advantages, but also two disadvantages. Its action is rather slow treated plants take several weeks to die and it is not rainfast. Rain showers up to several hours after application can wash glyphosate off plants, and thereby stop or reduce its herbicidal action. We have now discovered that formulations of glyphosate according to the invention, when applied by the method of the invention, have advtangages as compared with known glyphosate formulations, including activity at lower rates. The salts used in the formulations of the invention are conveniently made by mixing the herbicidal acid with an appropriate amine, preferably in stoichiometric quantities, if required with heating, and in the presence of a suitable polar solvent, eg. an alcohol such as methanol. If required, the solvent may afterwards be separated, eg. by distillation. The amine suitably has at least eight, preferably up to 22, carbon atoms particularly preferred on grounds of solubility are amines having 15 to 17 carbon atoms. Primary, secondary or tertiary amines may be employed. The solvents are suitably organic diluents, in particular hydrocarbons.The hydrocarbons can be hydrocarbon fractions of various kinds, which are readily commercially available examples are mixtures containing paraffinic, cycloparaffinic and or aromatic hydrocarbons such as Isopar G, L and M and white oil paraffinic hydrocarbons , Exsol D180 220 paraffinic cycloparaffinic hydrocarbons , Solvesso 150 and Aromasol H aromatic hydrocarbons and kerosene paraffinic aromatic hydrocarbons . Vegetable oils, for example groundnut or soyabean oil, may be used. Mixtures of non polar solvents may be used, eg. to give a diluent of the desired viscosity. High boiling hydrocarbon diluents are convenient and cheap, but usually have high resistivities eg. of the order of .1011 ohm centimetres . To bring down the resistivity of such solvents, they may be mixed with polar diluents, for example ketones, alcohols or aqueous alcohols.Another way of adjusting the resistivity of the solutions is to add an antistatic agent, for example the material ASA 3 sold as a static charge dissipator and consisting of a complex mixture of copper and chromium cations with various organic anions. Other additives useful in reducing the resistivity of hydrocarbon diluents are quaternary ammonium surfactants, as described in our European PatentApplication No 39144, the disclosure of which Application is incorporated by reference. The formulations of our invention conveniently have viscosities of 1 to 50, particularly 5 to 30, centistokes at 25 C if it is desired to increase the viscosity of formulations according to the invention, this may be done by addition of more viscous oil soluble diluents, for example polybutenes eg. Hyvis and long chain chlorinated hydrocarbon products such as Cereclor C42 or C48. The amount of amine salt in the formulations of the invention may vary within wide limits amounts of 0.1 to 50 , especially concentrated solutions containing 10 or 20 to 50 , by weight of the salt are preferred. Surfactants may be added to the formulations, conveniently in amounts of from about 2 to about 8 by weight poly ethylene oxide condensate surfactants are among those suitable. The compositions of our invention are applied to plants by electrostatic spraying without further dilution.This is conveniently carried out by apparatus of the type described in British Patent Specification No. 1569707, the disclosure of which Specification is incorporated herein by reference. Such apparatus conveniently comprises a conductive nozzle of capillary dimensions, to which the formulation is supplied. The nozzle is charged to a potential of about 20 30 kilovolts. There is thereby established a powerful electric field between the nozzle and a surrounding earthed electrode, sufficient to break up liquid delivered to the nozzle into a cloud of electrically charged droplets. Electrical forces then project these towards weeds to be sprayed, and assist in distributing the droplets evenly over such weeds. Further forms of the device of British Patent Specification No. 1569707 are described in British Applications Nos. 2030060A and 7944150, and published European Application No. 31649, the disclosures of which Applications are incorporated herein by reference. The following Examples illustrate our invention.Unless otherwise stated, resistivities and viscosities were measured at 250C. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates a formulation according to the invention. A solution was obtained by mixing together the following ingredients, with warming. Ingredient Parts by weight Glyphosate ground 10 Synprolam 57 20 Iso butanol 10 Water 5 Aromasol H 55 100 Synprolam 57 is the trade name for a mixture of C15 and C17 primary alkyl amines, mostly straight chain or t4 methyl branched alkyl amines. Aromasol H is the trade name of a high boiling aromatic hydrocarbon diluent. The resistivity of the formulation was measured in a Keithley electrometer at 25 C and found to be 1 x 106 ohm cm. EXAMPLE 2 A formulation according to the invention was made from the following ingredients. Ingredient Parts by weight Glyphosate ground 100 Synprolam 57 200 Isobutanol 100 Water 25 Aromasol H 575 1000 The glyphosate was weighed into a large beaker. The isobutanol was then added followed by the Synprolam 57.Finally about one half of the Aromasol H was added and the mixture was stirred with strong heating hot plate set to 150 C . When the mixture looked reasonably homogeneous ie.no large lumps , the water was added. The mixture tended to clear and a temperature rise was noticed. The heating and stirring was continued until all the glyphosate had dissolved. The solution was then clarified by filtering under reduced pressure. The resulting clear solution was then made up to volume with the rest of the Aromasol H. Resistivity 1.9 x 106 ohm cm 1 Viscosity 29.3 cSt .200C EXAMPLE 3 The formulation of Example 1 was tested by spraying onto plants through a device of the type described inBritish Patent Specification No. 1569707, at two different application rates, 1.6 kg hectare and 0.2 kg hectare, using 4 replicates per treatment. The plants were assessed two weeks after spraying and the results are shown in the Table below.EMI6.1 tb Plants SEP SEP kill SEP SEP kill tb SEP 1.6 SEP kg hectare SEP 0.2 SEP kg hectare tb Soya SEP 100 SEP 10 tb Sugar SEP beet SEP 100 SEP 96 tb Cyperus SEP 100 SEP 53 tb Echinochloa SEP 86 SEP 33 tb The kill obtained on weeds and sugar beet compared favourably with results obtained using commercial formulations of glyphosate in conventional high volume sprays.

EXAMPLE 11 The formulations of Example 6 and 7 were tested in the glasshouse, when applied via the Electrodyn sprayer as described in published European Patent Application No.31649, Figures 7 11 against soya bean plants and a range of grass weeds. Results are shown in Table 2 in comparison with conventional aqueous application. In some cases surfactant Synperonic NP5 or Agral 90 was added.Under the heading Applied by , ED indicates application by Electrodyn sprayer, CV by conventional aqueous formulation in 250 litres water hectare. Agral 90 is the trade name for a polyethleneoxide wetter. Synperonic NP5 is the trade name for a nonyl phenol ethylene oxide condensate surfactant. The Table illustrates that, in a number of cases, electrostatic spray application of the formulations of the invention gives better results than application of conventional formulations by conventional means. EXAMPLE 12 The formulations of Examples 8 10 were tested in the glasshouse, against wheat barley and various weed species.Results foliar kill assessed 21 days after treatment, are shown in Table 3 all figures are means of three replicates. The letters ED and CV have the same meanings as in Table 2. It will be seen that the formulations of the invention, applied by electrostatic spraying, are generally more active than conventional formulations conveniently applied. Fernimine is a trade name for conventional commercially available formulations of the herbicide 2,4 D.
