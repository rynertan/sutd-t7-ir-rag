## Description
The present invention relates to a process of producing copolymers and in particular to a process of producing copolymers of β hydroxybutyric acid and β hydroxyvaleric acids. Hereinafter poly β hydroxybutyric acid is referred to as PHB and poly β hydroxyvaleric acid is referred to as PHV. Thus the present invention relates to the production of PHB PHV copolymers. PHB is a thermoplastic polyester comprising repeat units of the formula Poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid is conveniently prepared by cultivating the micro organism in an aqueous medium on a suitable substrate, such as a carbohydrate or methanol, as an energy and carbon source. The substrate must, of course, be one that is assimilable by the micro organism. In order to promote accumulation of the polymer, at least part of the cultivation is preferably conducted under conditions wherein there is a limitation of a nutrient that is essential for growth of the micro organism but which is not required for polymer accumulation. Examples of suitable processes are described in EP A 15669 and 46344 and USP 4336334 and 4433053. United States Patent 4477654 discloses that PHB PHV copolymers can be made by cultivating certain microorganisms such as PHB PHV copolymers have a variety of uses in many fields of industry, for example see the article in Chemical Week, 28 August 1985, page 55 and in Manufacturing Chemist, October 1985, page 64. We have found that such ethanol utilising variants are also capable of assimilating other primary alcohols, e.g. propan 1 ol and, when cultivated on a substrate containing a primary alcohol having an odd number of carbon atoms, other than methanol, under conditions conducive to polymer accumulation, accumulate PHB PHV copolymers. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing a PHB containing polymer comprising cultivating a PHB accumulating strain of Alcohol utilising strains of In general ethanol utilising strains of When With some micro organisms, even in the absence of a polymer inducing constraint such as a limitation on one or more of the essential growth requirements, polymer may also be accumulated while growth of the micro organism is taking place however, except in the case of micro organisms that produce polymer constitutively, the amount of polymer so accumulated is generally small and typically is less than about 10 by weight of the cells produced. Although there can be a rise of polymer accumulation to about 30 by weight just before complete exhaustion. Thus when grown in batch culture, the micro organisms that do not produce polymer constitutively, will grow, with little or no polymer accumulation, until one or more of the essential requirements for growth becomes nearly exhausted or exhausted, and then the micro organism synthesises polymer. In order to produce copolymers it is necessary to use the alcohol containing an odd number of carbon atoms as at least part of the substrate present during the period when copolymer is accumulated. When the cultivation conditions are such that copolymer is not being accumulated to any significant extent, i.e. where the conditions are such that the amount of copolymer accumulated is less than 10 by weight of the micro organism cell dry weight, the odd numbered carbon atom alcohol will often be metabolised by the micro organism by alternative pathways that do not give rise to copolymer consequently in such cases copolymers will generally not be produced. Metabolism by such other pathways may also occur when using micro organisms that accumulate copolymer constitutively. Hence we prefer, even when using constitutive polymer accumulating micro organisms, to cause the copolymer to be accumulated by cultivation of the micro organism under conditions wherein the amount of one or more of the essential requirements for growth, but not polymer accumulation, is limited. Even when cultivating the micro organism under conditions where there is a restriction of an essential requirement for growth, so that copolymer is accumulated by the micro organism, some of the alcohol having an odd number of carbon atoms may be metabolised by pathways leading to acetyl CoA or intermediates of the TCA cycle. This enables the micro organism to synthesise β hydroxybutyrate units for incorporation into the copolymer as well as the β hydroxyvalerate units, even if the alcohol containing the odd number of carbon atoms is the sole substrate during the polymer accumulation stage. In order to produce copolymers, the substrate, during at least part of the period copolymer is being accumulated, contains a primary alcohol, other than methanol, containing an odd number of carbon atoms. The alcohol is preferably heptan 1 ol, pentan 1 ol, or particularly, propan 1 ol. Mixtures of such alcohols may be employed. The alcohol, or alcohols, having an odd number of carbon atoms may be used in admixture with another substrate assimilable by the micro organism for example ethanol or a carbohydrate such as glucose. In order to obtain a significant proportion of hydroxyvalerate units in the copolymer it is preferred that the amount of combined carbon in the substrate as the alcohol or alcohols having an odd number of carbon atoms is at least 2 , preferably at least 10 , by weight of the total combined carbon in the substrate present during the period when the cultivation conditions are such that copolymer is being accumulated by the micro organism. Preferably the alcohol of alcohols having an odd number of carbon atoms form at least 25 by weight of the substrate employed during the copolymer accumulation stage. As indicated above, it is preferred, even when using a micro organism that produces copolymer constitutively, to conduct the period of cultivation of the micro organism when copolymer is being accumulated under conditions of limitation of a nutrient required for growth but not for copolymer accumulation. In addition to the substrate and oxygen which is generally supplied by injecting air into the aqueous medium in the fermenter , various nutrient salts are required to enable the micro organism to grow. Thus sources of the following elements in assimilable form, normally as water soluble salts, are generally required nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and iron, together with traces of elements such as manganese, zinc and copper. While it may be possible to induce copolymer accumulation by restricting the supply of oxygen to the fermenter, it is preferred to restrict the amount of one or more of the nutrient salts. The most practical elements to limit are nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, or, less preferably, magnesium, sulphur or potassium. Of these it is most preferred to restrict the amount of nitrogen which is conveniently supplied as an ammonium salt . The amount of assimilable nitrogen required is about 8 15 by weight of the desired weight of cells less accumulated copolymer. The fermentation is preferably conducted so that the dry weight of the copolymer containing cells is at least 5 g per litre of aqueous medium. Hence if, for example, it is desired to produce 10 g per litre of polymer containing cells having a copolymer content of 40 by weight, the amount of the essential nutrient fed to the fermenter that is used to limit the amount of cell growth must be that required to support the growth of 6 g per litre of cells containing no copolymer thus, if nitrogen is employed as the growth limiting nutrient, since the nitrogen content of copolymer free bacterial cells is about 8 15 by weight, the amount of assimilable nitrogen required would be between about 0.5 and 0.9 g per litre, e.g. about 0.6 to 1.2 g of ammonium ions per litre. The fermentation may be conducted under the conditions e.g. pH, temperature, and degree of aeration unless oxygen is utilised as the limiting nutrient conventionally used for The micro organism is preferably grown to a certain desired weight by cultivation in the presence of sufficient of the nutrient required for growth that is to be restricted in the copolymer accumulation stage on a readily metabolisable substrate, such as a carbohydrate, and then cultivated under conditions of growth requirement restriction to cause the copolymer accumulation. In some cases the substrate for at least part, and in some cases all, of the growth stage may be the alcohol having an odd number of carbon atoms. The fermentation may be performed as a batch fermentation in which case copolymer accumulation will occur as the amount of the nutrient that is required for growth but not for copolymer accumulation becomes depleted. Alternatively the fermentation may be conducted as a continuous process wherein aqueous medium containing the bacterial cells is removed, continuously or intermittently, from the fermentation vessel at a rate corresponding to the rate of addition of fresh aqueous medium and substrate thereto. It is preferred that the amount of the nutrient that is restricted that is fed to the fermentation vessel is such that the aqueous medium removed from the vessel contains little or none of that nutrient, and the aqueous medium removed from the vessel is then fed to a second fermentation vessel, operated either in batch or, preferably, continuous fashion wherein copolymer accumulation is caused to take place by continuing the aerobic cultivation with the addition of a fresh quantity of substrate comprising the comonomer component. While additional quantities of substrate and nutrient salts may be added in this further fermentation step, since further growth is generally not desired, little or no further quantity of the nutrient utilised to limit growth should be added. It will however be appreciated that the aqueous medium fed to the further fermenter or fermenters from the first fermenter may contain some residual quantity of the limiting nutrient and or the addition of a further small quantity thereof may be desireable for efficient operation. Alternatively the fermentation may be conducted as a single stage continuous process. In order to achieve copolymer accumulation by means of nutrient limitation the residence time of the medium in the fermenter is made sufficiently long to allow the micro organism to grow and exhaust the limiting nutrient supplied to the fermenter and to allow the micro organism then to accumulate the copolymer. In either a batch process, or continuous processes as described above, the alcohol having an odd number of carbon atoms is used as part, or all, of the substrate during the copolymer accumulation stage occurring upon exhaustion of the nutrient required for growth. The fermentation is preferably conducted so that the amount of accumulated copolymer comprises about 30 to 80 by weight of the bacterial cells. The copolymer, which generally has a molecular weight above 50,000 weight average and has the D configuration, may be extracted from the micro organism cells by a variety of techniques, for example those described in EP A 15123. The invention is illustrated by the following examples. Growth on CMHO 75 agar, 5 hours at 30 No growth exhibited on methanol at 5 or 14 days. Growth exhibited on propan 1 ol at 3 days. Resistant to penicillin G and streptomycin sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, polymyxin B and novobiocin weakly . Iron and nitrogen were also continuously supplied, as aqueous solutions containing 11.5 g l of nitrogen as ammonium hydroxide and 2 g l ferrous sulphate heptahydrate acidified with sulphuric acid respectively, at such rates that the nitrogen and iron contents of the medium fed to the fermenter were 1040 mg l and 7 mg l respectively. Ethanol and propan 1 ol were supplied at a rate of 12.1 and 12.6 g l respectively. pH was controlled at 6.8 by the automatic addition of a 9 1 v v mixture of 4 M potassium hydroxide and 4 M sodium hydroxide. After 5 days steady state fermentation the cell dry weight of the effluent from the fermenter was 16.14 g.l and the cells contained 47 by weight of an PHB PHV copolymer containing about 20 mol PHV units and having a melting point of 133 Example 1 was repeated with the following changes After 5 days continuous steady state fermentation the cell dry weight was 12.02 g l and the cells contained 38 by weight of a polymeric product. The polymeric product contained a higher overall PHV content than the polymer of Example 1 but was a complex product, exhibiting three distinct melting point peaks at 92.4 The pH was controlled at 6.8 by the automatic addition of 50 vol vol ammonium hydroxide solution. After 10.5 hours the culture became carbon limited and a premixed feed of ethanol 335 gl ¹ and propan 1 ol 52 gl ¹ was introduced to the fermenter. Overall 620 mls of mixed feed was added to the fermenter over 33 hours so that there was an average rate of addition of ethanol of 2 gl ¹ hr ¹. The final cell dry weight was 33 gl ¹ and the cells contained 71 by weight of PHB PHV polymer containing about 10 mol hydroxyvalerate units. This had a melting point of 158
