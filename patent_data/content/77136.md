# LINE PROTECTOR AND RELATED TERMINATION ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A line protector and ascociated termination structure comprises a module 2 havirg printed circuit board wir ing 32, 34, 36 internally thereof and also as outwardly projecting contacts 32b, 34b, 36b for connection to a printed clrcuit board edge connector 80 . An insu lator 74 is disposed rioainst the printed circuit board and is slidable therealong and optionaliy serves to in terrupt the tip in and ring in sides 86 of the telephone line when it is desired to place tile protector module in the so called detent position. The protector module may be restored to its normal operating condition by retracting the insulator or by removing the module en tirely from its position in the connector and then re inserting the module fully into the connector. This latter operation automatically slides the insulator to its non detent position.
