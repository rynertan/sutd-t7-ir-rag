# Missing or broken wafer sensor.

## Abstract
Apparatus for sensing a missing or broken wafer in an automated wafer transfer system. The apparatus includes means for moving a wafer transfer mechanism 150 from a first position along a prescribed path. A counter coupled to an oscillator is enabled when the wafer transfer mechanism 150 and a wadfer 226 are moved away from the first position. A photosensor 220 senses the presence of the water at a second position along the prescribed path and inhibits the counter. The count stored in the counter is compared with a predetermined count corresponding to the time required for movement of an unbroken wafer to the second position. If the counts do not agree, a missing or broken wafer is indicated and corrective action is taken.
