# Prosthetic nail.

## Abstract
A prosthetic nail that is intended as a replacement or substitute for an injured or diseased nail for the digits on a hand or foot generally consists of three main components 1 a generally smooth and slightly curved plate 14 having a rear edge 16 that is adapted to be partially buried within the eponychial fold of a digit, somewhat like the proximal portion of a natural nail is buried 2 an anchor member 20 connected to the plate near the forward edge thereof and serving to anchor the forward part of the plate against unwanted movement with respect to the distal phalangeal bone and 3 some means 30, 32 for preventing lateral movement of the plate with respect to the bone. Several versions of frontal anchor members are shown, and all versions share a characteristic of having at least some space into which the patient s tissue may be positioned for mechanically locking the prosthetic nail to the digit.
