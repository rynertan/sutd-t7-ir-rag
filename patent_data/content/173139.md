# Printing apparatus.

## Abstract
A printing apparatus is disclosed which comprises a platen roller 5 for feeding a cut paper sheet set on a hopper, a paper bail bar 7a having paper bail rollers 7 used in conjunction with the platen roller to secure the cut paper sheet against the platen roller, and a paper loading mechanism for loading the cut paper sheet by causing rota tion of the platen roller at a predetermined angle. The paper loading mechanism includes a paper bail switch 22 for checking whether the paper bail roller is in contact with the platen roller. When it is detected by the paper bail switch 22 that the paper bail roller is released from the platen roller, the platen roller is rotated in the normal direction at a first predetermined angle. When, it is detected by the paper bail switch 22 that the paper bail rollers are in contact with the platen roller, the platen roller is rotated in the reverse direction at a second predetermined angle.
