# Flush valve attachment system.

## Abstract
A flush valve connectable to a wall of a toilet tank is dis closed. In one embodiment, there is a non circular outlet 15 formed in the bottom wall 14 of the tank. There is also a resilient seal 23 bearing against an upper surface of the bottom wall, the seal surrounding the outlet and having a central bore aligned therewith. A flush valve 16 is pro vided having a housing 27 that extends through the seal bore and outlet. The housing also has an outwardly extend ing flange 33 above the seal to trap the seal against the bottom wall, and a radially outwardly extending projection 38 below the bottom wall. The housing is rotatable be tween a first position in which the projection can pass verti cally through the outlet, and a second position where the projection can catch under the bottom wall. In another em bodiment, there is a stop member 40 formed on the out side of the housing below the resilient seal and above the projection, the stop member being suitable to interact with the periphery of the outlet to limit rotation of the housing re lative to the outlet.
