# 16 Quadrature amplitude modulation modulator for radio links.

## Abstract
16 Quadrature amplitude modulation modulator for radio links, converting a train of data into signals having a phase selected out of 16 phase values and an amplitude selected out of four values, said modulator comprising means for dividing said data train into two data sub trains, two four phase modulators, a carrier wave generator for feeding said two four phase modulators, and means for applying said two data sub trains respectively to said four phase modulators. The 16 QAM modulator also com prises two phase loops each including a voltage controlled microwave oscillator and a differential phase detector asso ciated with said microwave oscillator, said differential phase detector being respectively connected to the output of a four phase modulator and the output of the associated microwave oscillator and controlling said voltage controlled microwave oscillator. Means provided for adding predeter mined parts of the output signals of the two phase loops.
