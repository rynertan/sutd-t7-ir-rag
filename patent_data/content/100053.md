It will be understood by those skilled in the art that compounds having an asymmetric carbon may exist in both levo and dextro forms, said forms being within the scope of the invention. The present new compounds can be prepared by reaction of an acylating derivative of an acid of the formulaEMI9.1 with a compound of the formulaEMI9.2 or, alternatively, the present new compounds can be prepared by reaction of an acylating derivative of an acid of the general formulaEMI9.3 with a compound of the formulaEMI10.1 preferably with carbodiimides present as are commonly used in peptide synthesis, e.g., N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.A reaction solvent is normally used to permit more intimate contact of the reactants and includes such solvents as ethers of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, alkyl ketones such as acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone and similar solvents. Reaction temperature is not critical since the reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature and even at lower temperatures. The use of high temperature for the reaction, e.g., reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, will shorten.the reaction time but may lead to undesirable by products.Generally, the reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature until complete. The products are recovered by usual methods and purified as by recrystallization from suitable solvents In those compounds where free acid groups are present, e.g., where Y is OH, the compounds can readily form salts with suitable cations, preferably those which are pharmaceutically acceptable, e.g. , both mono and polyvalent metal ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and the like, and ammonium ions derived from ammonia, primary secondary and tertiary amines.
