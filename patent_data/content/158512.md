# RESET CIRCUIT RESET CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A reset circuit resets an internal circuit 3 included in an electronic apparatus. The internal circuit generates a pulse signal indicating that the internal circuit is in an enabled state. This pulse signal is supplied to an inverter 63 through an integrating circuit comprising a resistor 61 and a capacitor 62 , so that the pulse signal in the inverter is inverted in polarity to be supplied to one input terminal of an AND gate as a reset inhibit signal. To the other input terminal of the AND gate is supplied a reset signal generated based on transient phenomena at the time of turning on of the DC power source. If the AND gate is closed by the reset inhibit signal, the internal circuit does not receive the reset signal from the AND gate. Accordingly, the internal circuit in operation wil never be reset if the reset signal is supplied thereto.
