# Comparator circuit.

## Abstract
A comparator circuit of easily expandable form is constructed of two first circuits for comparing the bit data of two digital words, and a judgement circuit which outputs comparison signals in response to the outputs of the two first comparator circuits. The aforementioned circuits constitute the basic building block of the comparator circuit. Expandability is provided by replacing the first comparator circuits with the basic building block circuits, and by then replacing the first comparator circuits of the added basic building block circuits with further basic building block circuits, etc. The comparator circuit thus formed is advantageous in that the number of cascade levels increases no faster than nN, where N is the number of bits to be compared.

## Description
COMPARATOR CIRCUIT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a comparator circuit usable with a control circuit for a servomotor, a digital signal processing circuit, or the like, for comparing the magnitude of two positive binary input signals. The conventional comparator circuit is constructed in accordance with the following algorithm. Two input signals are denoted by X and Y, and a signal which takes a 1 level only when the input signal X is equal to or larger than the input signal Y is denoted by F. Suffixes attached to the letters X, Y and F denote the bit numbers.First, the minimum bits X1 and Y1 of the input signals are compared, and the comparison result signal F1 W Xl Y1 is outputted. Subsequently, comparisons of the higher bits are sequentially conducted in accordance with the following recurring equation Fi Xi Yi Yi Xi Yi Fib i 1 .... 1 One example of this circuit is shown in Fig. 1. The input signal Xi i a 1 to N, X the maximum bit is inputted to the input terminal 111 1 of a 1 bit comparator circuit 101 i i 2 1 to N , and the input signal Yi 1 1 to N, YN the maximum bit is inputted to the input terminal 112 i. First, for the respective bits, the magnitude comparisons are conducted at the 1 bit comparator circuits 101 1 to 101 N. Next, in accordance with equation 1 , the comparison results of the 1 bit comparator circuits are referred se uential1y, beginning with the lower bits, by control circuits 102 1 to 102 N 1 , as to whether or not the signals Xi and Y1 are equal.Finally, a magnitude comparison signal or an equality signal is outputted from the output terminals 115 and 116 of the control circuit 102 N 1 as a comparison result signal. The above process is generally known as the parallel comparator circuit process and is widely used. Despite this fact, however, the conventional comparator circuit has its operational time period elongated with an increase in the bit number, because it operates according to the above recurring equation.In a signal processor having a large bit number e.g., 16 or 32 bits , therefore, it has been very difficult to provide a high speed comparator circuit. SUGARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a comparator circuit operable at high speed. Another object of the present invention is to provide a simplified comparator circuit.

The circuits 1 1 and 1 2 perform absolutely the same operations. Table 1 enumerates the relations of the logical values of the input and output terminals of the circuit 1 1 using a truth table.When the value Al of the first input terminal al is at a 1 level whereas the value B1 of the second input terminal bl is at a O level, namely, when Al Bl, the value of the first output terminal cl takes the level 11111. When the value Al of the terminal al is equal to the value B1 of the terminal bl, on the other hand, the value of the terminal dl takes the level lilt . In other words, the output at terminal cl is lt when Al Bl, and the output at terminal dl is 11111 when Al B1. Terminals cl, dl are thus never both at the 1 level. Table 1 also applies to the circuit 1 2. As to the input signals of the circuit 1 2, the signal to be inputted to the terminal a2 is denoted by A2, and the signal to the inputted to the terminal b2 is denoted by B2. Table 2 enumerates the relations of the logical values of the input and output terminals of the circuit 2 1 using a truth table. In Table 2, when the value at the terminal c2 or d2 is at the 1 level and the value at the terminal cl is at the 1 level, the value of the terminal i takes the 1 level. If this relation is applied together withTable 1 to the values A t A2 A1 and B B2 B1 of the input signal strings, it corresponds to the relation in which A2 Al, B2 Bl 11, 00 , 11, 01 , 1S, 10 , 10, 00 , 10, 01 and 01, 00 . In other words, only when A B, the value of the terminal 1 takes the 1 level.Only when the terminals cl and c2 are at the O level and the terminals dl and d2 are at the 1 level, does the value of the terminal j take the 1 level. This corresponds to the relation in which A2 . Al, B2 . B1 00, 00 , 01, 01 , 10, 10 and 11, 11 , namely, A o B. From the description thus far made, it will be understood that the signals of the states of A B andA B are obtained at the terminals i and j by inputting the signal A in the order of minimum to maximum btts to the terminals al and a2 and the signal B in the order of minimum to maximum bits to the terminals bl and b2. Fig. 3 is a 3 bit comparator circuit constructed of the basic components of Fig. 2. ThiS comparator circuit is constructed by replacing either of the 1 bit comparator circuit 1 1 or 1 2 of the basic comparator circuit BC ofFig. 2 with the 2 bit comparison function. If the first input signal A is inputted such that ordered minimum to maximum bits Al to A3 are applied to the terminals al, a2 and a3 via signal lines 11 1, 11 2 and 11 3, respectively, and if the second input signal B is inputted such that ordered minimum to maximum bits B1 to B3 are applied to the terminals bl, b2 and b3 via signal lines 12 1, 12 2 and 12 3, respectively, the magnitude comparison signal and the equality signal of the lower two bits of the signal A and the lower two bits of the signal B obtained by the comparison at the comparator circuit BC are outputted to the signal lines 13 1 and 14 1, respectively. The magnitude comparison signal and the equality signal of the maximum bits A3 and B3 obtained by the comparison at a third comparator circuit 1 3 are outputted to the terminals c3 and d3, respectively. These output signals are inputted to a judging circuit 3 1 which is the same circuit as the judging circuit 2 1. In the circuit 3 l, arithmetic operations are conducted in accordance withTable 2 so that the signals A B and A B are obtained at terminals i and j, respectively.Thus, the 3 bit comparator circuit is realized, Fig. 4 shows an example in which the circuit ofFig. 3 is expanded to constitute a 4 bit comparator circuit. The illustrated 4 bit comparator contains two basic comparator circuits BC, each of which is the same circuit as shown in Fig. 2. Further, to produce a comparison signal and a equality signal for a pair of 4 bit data, a judging circuit 3 1 is provided at an output stage. This circuit 3 1 is also the same circuit as the circuit 2 1 or 2 2. In this case, only three judging circuits are required. Moreover, ari operation of the judging circuit 2 2 can be performed in parallel with that of the judging circuit 2 1 in Fig. 4.According to the comparator circuit shown in Fig. 4, thus, the comparison result can be derived through two judging stages S1 and 52. On the other hand, in the 4 bit comparator circuit of the prior art shown in Fig. 1, the comparison result is derived through three judging stages S1 to S3. Consequently, the comparator circuit of the present invention can operate at a high speed with a minimum delay time. Generally speaking, an N bit comparator circuit can be easily constructed using the method thus far described, i. e., the method of arranging the judging circuits according to a tournament style. Fig. 5 illustrates an 8 bit comparator circuit of the present invention for comparing an 8 bit data A with an 8 bit data B. In this circuit, eight 1 bit comparator circuits 1 1 to 1 8 and even judging circuits 2 1 to 2 4, 3 1, 3 2 and 4 1 are arranged according to a tournament style. Fig. 6 illustrates a 16 bit comparator circuit in which two 8 bit comparator circuits shown in Fig. 5 are provided in parallel and a judging circuit 5 1 is added to outputs of judging circuits 4 1 and 4 2. Fig. 7 illustrates detailed circuit diagrams of the first comparator circuit 1 1 and the second comparator circuit 1 2. The circuit 1 1 is the same circuit as the circuit 1 2 and contains an invertor 71 coupled to the input terminal a, an NOR gate 72 coupled to the invertor 71 and the input terminal b, an exclusive OR gate 73 coupled to the terminals a and b and an invertor 74 coupled to the exclusive OR gate 73. The terminals c and d are coupled to an output of the NOR gate 72 and an output of the invertor 74, respectively. Fig. 8 illustrates a detailed circuit diagram of the judging circuit 2 1. The terminal g is coupled to an NAND gate 84 via an invertor 81. The terminsls f and g are both coupled to an NAND gate 82 whose output is coupled to the NAND gate 84. The terminals f and h are both coupled to an NAND gate 83 whose output is coupled to an invertor 85. The terminals i and j are coupled to an output of the NAND gate 84 and an output of the invertor 85, respectively. The NOR gate 72 receives A and B and produces a level 1 signal only when the signal A is rager than the signal B e.g. A 1, B O . The invertor 74 produces a level In signal only when the signal A is equal to the signal B e.g. A B 1 or A B O . On the other hand, theNAND gate 84 produces a level 1 signal only when Ai 1 Di 1 or when A 1 I B 1 and As, Bi, The output of the NAND gate 84 is used as a comparison signal. The invertor 85 produces a level In signal only when AS 1 Bi 1 and Aj I Bi. This signal is used as a equality signal. The judging circuit 2 1 may be modified to Fig. 9 in which two AND gates and an OR gate are employed. The comparator circuit which can be realized as described hereinbefore is characterized in that the increase in the cascade steps of the judging circuit is smaller for a given increase in the bit number than is the case in the prior system. For example, the number of cascade steps of judging circuits required of the 4 bit comparator circuits shown in Fig. 4 is 2. Moreover, the number of cascade steps of judging circuits for 5 to 8 bit comparator circuits is 3. As a result, the drop in the operating speed is far smaller than in the comparator circuit of the prior art as the bit number increases. If a comparison is made between 16 bit digital words, for example, the step number of the judging circuit according to the prior art method shown in Fig. 1 is 15, whereas the step number of the comparator according to the present invention is only 4 as shown in Fig. 6.Thus, the present invention can perform an important role in realizing a high speed comparator circuit. The present invention can easily applied to a 32 or 64bit comparator circuit.
