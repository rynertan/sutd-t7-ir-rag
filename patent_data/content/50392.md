# Automatic frequency control system.

## Abstract
An automatic frequency control system comprises frequency measuring means IFM , which produces a frequency quantity representing the frequency of its input signal, and controllable frequency signal generating means VCO , which produces an output signal whose frequency depends on a control signal supplied to its control input. In a normal mode of operation, IFM derives its input signal from an external source connected to an input terminal T , and the system derives from the frequency quantity produced by IFM a control signal for VCO, using a predetermined transfer characteristic, so that the output frequency of VCO is dependent on the frequency of the input signal to IFM, being for example equal to the frequency of the signal at T. In order that the system may have an accurate and rapid response, said transfer characteristic is predetermined in a ca libration mode of operation in which different control signals for VCO are derived from a calibration signal generator CSG , consequent input signals for IFM are derived from the output of VCO, and different conse quent frequency quantities produced by IFM are as sociated with respective control signals for VCO by storing digital words representing these control signals in a random access memory RAM at respective ad dresses which are consequent frequency quantities from IFM. The system may be recalibrated at intervals to take account of drifts in the system.
