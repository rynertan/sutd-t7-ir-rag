# Inorganic gels and ceramic papers, films, fibres and boards processes for production thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention is related to the production of crystal containing gels and papers, films, fibres, boards, and coatings made therefrom. The process for making the gels comprises three general steps first, a fully or predominantly crystalline body is formed containing crystals consisting essentially of a lithium and or sodium water swelling mica selected from the group of fluorhectorite, hydroxyl hectorite, boron fluorphlogopite, hydroxyl boron phlogopite, and solid solutions among those and between those and other structu rally compatible species selected from the group of talc, fluortalc, polylithionite, fluorpolylithionite, phlogopite, and fluorphlogopite second, that body is contacted with a polar liquid, desirably water, to cause swelling and disintegration of the body accompanied with the formation of a gel and, third, the solid liquid ratio of the gel is adjusted to a desired value depending upon the application therefor. Where papers, films, fibres, boards or coatings are desired, such are prepared from the gel, and to impart good chemical durability thereto, are thereafter contacted with a source of large cations to effect an ion exchange reaction between the large cations and the Li and or Na ions from the interlayer of the crystals, and the products then dried. Glass ceramic bodies are the preferred starting materials.
