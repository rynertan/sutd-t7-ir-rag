# Automatic transmission with overdrive housing including its own accumulator.

## Abstract
An automatic transmission includes a transaxle casing and an overdrive casing fixed to the transaxle casing. A gear transmission mechanism is housed within the transaxle casing, and an overdrive mechanism is housed within the overdrive casing. Each of these is hydraulically controlled. A first hydraulic fluid accumulator for moderating sudden pressure changes within a part of a control mechanism for the gear transmission mechanism is housed within the transaxle casing, and a second hydraulic fluid accumulator for moderating sudden pressure changes within a part of a control mechanism for the overdrive mechanism is housed within the overdrive casing. Thereby a common type of transaxle casing may be used both for an automatic transmission assembly which incorporates such an over drive mechanism and for an automatic transmission assem bly which does not incorporate such an overdrive mechan ism, and in the latter case no waste of space within the transaxle casing due to the unnecessary provision of space for the second hydraulic fluid accumulator need occur.
