# Distributor device for aluminium sheets or similar materials.

## Abstract
A distributor device for dispensing aluminium sheets or foil, or the like materials, is provided with a shaft means 4 , which is effective to support the roll 5 of aluminium sheet or foil, and with a saw means 6 effective to cut the sheets or foil. In order to allow use to be made, by the same distributor device, of rolls having various lengths, the distributor device is provided with a roll supporting shaft means which is adjustable in length. Said roll supporting shaft means, adjustable in length, comprises a cylindrical, continuous sur face member or spindle 7 having a screwthreaded exten sion 8 at one end thereof, said screwthreaded extension 8 being in the form of a cylindrical member or spindle which has a smaller diameter than that of the continuous surface, main spindle 7 and which can threadably receive thereon a number of cylindrical, hollow spacer means 9 . At the ends the supporting shaft means 4 is provided with two bearing bases 2,3 of which the one 2 being fitted at the screw threaded extension 8 of the supporting shaft means 4 , is formed with two opening means 8 , 6 permitting both the screwthreaded spindle 8 and the corresponding end of the saw means 6 to be adjustably received therethrough. Lock ing in place of the perforated bearing use 2 is effected by tightening against the outer surface thereof a threaded ring 11 which can be threadably fitted onto the screwthreaded component 8 of the supporting shaft means 4 .
