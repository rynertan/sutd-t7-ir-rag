## Description
A WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER ASSEMBLY The present invention relates to a windshield defroster for a vehicle, and more particularly to improvements in a screen for preventing an object from dropping into a defroster duct through a defroster outlet formed in a top surface of a dashboard of the vehicle. EPC Application Ref TTS 84 EPC 028H LBN , filed in EuropeanPatent Office which is entitled A WINDSHIELD DEFROSTERASSEMBLY , is contemporaneous with this application and discloses a windshield defroster having a plate or rudder secured to a defroster duct to control the flow of heated air, In another embodiment the plate or rudder is also secured to a screen which is attached to the defroster duct. FIGS. 13 and 14 show a prior art approach disclosed in JapaneseUtility Model Application Laid open No. Showa 51 82236. As illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14, a windshield defroster includes a duct 30 and a screen 50 having a plurality of openings 502 and a plurality of bars 501. The screen 50 is disposed on one end of the duct 30, and the screen 50 is integrally and rigidly formed with duct 30. However, in fact, it is very difficult to form the defroster duct 30 which has the integral and rigid screen 308. Therefore, generally, the screen 308 is separated from the defroster duct 30. Accordingly, the screen 50 which prevents an object from dropping into the duct 30, must be fixed to the duct 30 prior to the windshield defroster being installed into the dashboard of the vehicle. Further, screen 50 covers the entire outlet area of the duct 30, so that screen 50 must be large and heavy. Therefore, even if it is possible to form the defroster duct 30 having the integral, rigid and entirely covered screen 308, this prior art approach increases the material and labor requirements during installation of the duct 30 under the dashboard 20. FIGS. i5 through FIG. 20 show other prior art approaches.Windshield defrosters shown in FIGS. 15, 16 and 18 do not utilize a screen for preventing an object from dropping into the defroster duct 30. The windshield defroster shown in FIG. 17 includes a plurality of openings 5û2 and a plurality of bars 501 provided in the top surface 201 of dashboard 20. While the windshield defroster shown in FIG. 17 can prevent an object om dropping into the defroster duct 30, it Is very difficult to align the openings 502 and bars 501 within the top surface 201 of dashboard 20 with the defroster outlet 70 in the dashboard 28. The windshield defroster shown in FIG. 19 has a separate screen 50 which is placed within the defroster outlet 70 of the dashboard 20.The screen 50 includes a plurality of bars 501 and a plurality of openings 502. Fnrthermore, the windshield defroster shown in FIG. 20 has a separate net type screen 50. Both of these windshield defrostersInclude a screen 50 which Is separated from the dashboard 20 and duct 30, so that each windshield defroster consists of many components and it is therefore necessary for the installer to assemble many components to the dashboard 20, before the duct 30 is installed under the dashbwd 20. The present invention has been developed to overcome the disadvantages desenbed above. One object of the present invention is to provide a windshield defroster which prevent an object from dropping into a duct through a defroster outlet. Another object Is to prmde a windshield defroster duct which requires very little material and therefore bghtens the weight f the vehicle. Another object is to provide of a windshield defroster in which It is easy to install a screen in the windshield defroster duct without spending much time or labor. In order to accomplish the above described objects, a windshield defroster according to the present invention includes a defroster duct having a first outlet and a screen integrated to the duct. The defroster outlet is formed on the top surface of the dashboard of a vehicle. The duct is secured to the bottom surface of the dashboard. Between the bottom surface of the dashboard and the upper peripheral edge of the duct, a screen is disposed. The screen has a first edge which is connected to the upper peripheral edge of the duct by a hinge, and this hinge is integral with the screen and the duct. The screen is not separable from the duct, so that this windshield defroster does not include many components and it is not necessary for the defroster installer to assemble many components within the dashboard.The screen is not rigid and the screen is swingable on the duct by a hinge, so that it is easy to form the duct which have the integrally hinged screen. Each screen has a free edge or a second edge which is positioned within the outlet which is defined within the upper peripheral edge of the duct. Since most of the outlet of the duct is not covered by the screen, the duct does not require a lot of excess materials and therefore the duct is lighter thereby reducing the weight of the vehicle. The duct has a first projection which extends horizontally from the upper peripheral edge, and the screen has a lower surface which is in contact with the horizontal surface of the first projection of the duct.Furthermore, the hinge, described above, connects a front edge of the first projection to one edge of the screen. The screen is supported by the first projection of the duct and the hinge, and the screen extends horizontally without any additional support for the free edge of the screen. Thus, it is not necessary for the installer to fix the screen on the upper peripheral edge of the duct, and it is only necessary for the installer to bend back the screen on the upper peripheral edge of the duct along the hinge, before the duct is installed under the dashboard. The screen includes a protrusion on the lower surface thereof, and the upper peripheral edge of the duct has a recess. A pair of blocks are raised from the bottom surface of the recess. The protrusion is inserted into the recess and the protrusion is therefore ill frictional contact with the pair of blocks, so that the screen can not rotate about the hinge, and the screen does not make any noise on the upper peripheral edge of the duct or the bottom surface of the dashboard.Furthermore, it is easy to install the duct under the dashboard, because it is not necessary for the installer to concern himself with the screen. It is noted that instead of a single screen, a plurality of screens could be integrated into the duct. In this case, each screen would have an edge which is connected to the upper peripheral edge of the duct by a hinge. Also, it Is clear that a plurality of defroster outlets, with their respective defroster ducts and screens, could be positioned across the dashboard of a vehicle.

It is easy to install the first duct 30 on the bottom surface 202 of the dashboard 20, because the first projectIon 301 of the first duct 30 can be mounted on the hook 204 of the dashboard 20, and then the second projection 302 of the first duct 30 can be inserted into the recess 204 of the dashboard 20. That 18, the second projection 302 can be pushed toward the front of the vehicle, since the duct 30 is somewhat elastic, so that the second projection 302 can be inserted into the recess 203. A seal member 304Is positioned between a lower edge 303 of the first duct 30 and a top edge of a second duct 305. Tis second duct 305 communicates with the heater 307. The heater 307 is placed under the dashboard 20 , and the heater 307 heats the air. The blower 306 is positioned in the vicinity of the heater 307, and the blower 306 distribute the warm air to the defroster outlet 70 through the second duct 305 and the first duct 30. The first duct 30 includes a screen 50 on the first projection 301 of the first duct 30. A front or first edge of the screen 50 is connected to a front edge of the first projection 301 of the first duct 30 by a hinge 40, and the hinge 40 is Integrated with the first duct 30 and the screen 50. Therefore, the screen 50 can rotate about the hinge 40 on the first projection 301 of the first duct 30. The screen 50 has a lower surface which is in contact with the upper surface of the first projection 301 of the duct 30. Accordingly, the screen 50 extends horizontally from the upper peripheral edge of the first duct 30, when the screen 50 is bent back on the first projection 301 of the duct 30.Therefore, the screen 50 is supported horizontally under the bottom surface 202 of the dashboard 20 without any support for the other edge or second edge of the screen 50 which parallels the front or first edge of the screen 50. The opening 502 of the screen 50 is congruent with the defroster outlet 70, so that the warm air is distributed to the defroster outlet 70 through the opening 502 of the screen 50. Both ends of b the bar 501 are fixed on an inner peripheral edge of the opening 502 of the screen 50, and a plurality of the bars 501 are located in a parallel relationship to each other. An intermediate portion of each bar 501 is placed in the defroster outlet 70. Thus, the screen 50 can prevent an object from dropping into the first duct 30 through the defroster outlet 70. FIGS. 4 through 8 show a windshield defroster of a second embodiment. While most of the components in the second embodiment are the same as those previously described above for the first embodiment, the second embodiment has several differences. In the second embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4, a first duct 30 includes a plurality of screens 50 on a first projection 301 of the first duct 30, and as shown in FIG. 5, a first edge 503 of each screen 50 is connected to a front edge of the first projection 301 by a hinge 40.The hinge 40 is integrated with the first duct 30 and the screen 50, and the screen 50 includes an opening 502 which is separated by a plurality of bars 501. The screen 50 includes a reinforcement 80 at the lateral central portion of the screen 50. The reinforcement 80 extends from the first edge 503 to the second edge 504. The reinforcement 80 Is fixed on the lower surface of the screen 50. Also, the reinforcement 80 extends downwardly and has a slanted edge 801 in the viciiiity of the first edge 503 of the screen 50. The slanted edge 801 slantes to the left as shown in FIG. 7. The first duct 30 includes a first recess 802 in the upper peripheral edge thereof. A slanted bottom 803 is formed in the first recess 802, and the slanted bottom 803 slantes to the left as shown in FIG. 7.The first recess 802 Is disposed in the vicinity of the reinforcement 80, so that the slanted edge 801 of the reinforcement 80 is in contact with the slanted bottom 803 of the first recess 802, when the screen 50 is positioned back on the first projection 301 of the first duct 30. Therefore, the screen 50 is supported horizontally by the slanted edge 801 of the reinforcement 80 and the slanted bottom 803 of the first recess 802 without any support for the second edge 504 of the screen 50. However, the second edge 504 may be In contact with the bottom surface 202 of the dashboard 20. Thus, the screen 50 can prevent an object from dropping into the first duct 30 through the defroster outlet 70, even if the object is heavy. As further shown in FIG. 5, the screen 50 includes a protrusion 60 on the lower surface thereof, and the protrusion 60 is formed in the shape of the letter U . The protrusion 60 has a bottom end 602 and has two free ends 603. Furthermore, the protrusion 60 includes contact surfaces 601 on both sides in the vicinity of the two free ends 603 of protrusion 60. The first duct 30 Includes a second recess 90 in the upper peripheral edge thereof, and a horizontal bottom 902 is formed in the second recess 90. Two blocks 901 are raised within the second recess 90, and each block 981 has a contact side The contact side 904 of block 901 faces the contact side 905 of the other block 901, and as shown in FIG. 8, both contact surfaces 601 of protrusion 60 are in frictional contact .wIth the contact sides 904 and 905 of the respective blocks 901. Thus, the screen 50 is mounted securely on the first projection 301 of the first duct 30 by the protrusion 60 of the screen 50 and the second recess 90 of the first duct 30, and the screen 50 will not rotate about the hinge 40 since the protrusion 60 of the screen 50 has been inserted into the second recess 90.Therefore, it is not necessary for the defroster installer to concern himself with the screen 50 once the screen 50 is positioned back onto the first projection 301 of the first duct 30, and the protrusion 60 is inserted into the second recess 90. As shown in FIG. 5, the bottom end 602 of the protrusion 60 is in contact with the horizontal bottom 902 of the second recess 90.Therefore, the bottom end 602 of the protrusion 60 and the horizontal bottom 902 of the second recess 90 prevent the screen 50 from bending past an imaginary horizontal plane of the vehicle. FIG. 9 shows a windshield defroster of a third embodiment. While most of the components in the third embodiment are the same as those previously described for the second embodiment, the third embodiment has several differences. In the third embodiment, a dashboard 20 includes a first hook 208, a second hook 204, and a third hook 206 on the bottom surface 202 of dashboard 20.
