# Digital frequency measuring circuitry.

## Abstract
Digital frequency measuring circuitry is disclosed which includes a first shift register 10 the content of which is increased by a fixed amount at the beginning of each cycle of the input signal to be measured. Thereafter the content of the first register is caused to exponentially decay until the next input cycle is detected, whereupon the process is repeated. At the beginning of each cycle of the input signal, the content of the first register is transferred to a second or memory register 12 , where the data is used to drive a gage or other output device. To improve gage performance during low frequency input the memory register is also updated whenever the con tent of the first register is less than the content of the memory register. Also, if the input signal is removed, any significant residual in the first register is eliminated by decrementing the first register to ensure that the gage accurately represents the input condition.
