## Description
BENZOYL UREAS HAVING IN9ECTICIDE ACTIVITYThe present invention relates to benzoylurea derivatives having insectididal activity and, in particular, it relates to l benzoyl 3 aryl urea derivatives which are particularw ly active against eggs and larvae of insects noxious in the agrarian and civil field, as well as to the use of these derivatives and a process for their preparation.Several l benzoyl 3 aryl urea derivatives having insecticide activity are known.Among them, Diflubenzuron generic name for 1 2,6 difluorobenzoyl 3 4 chlorophenyl urea which is described inUS A 3 993 908 has been the first product to be marketed.However, Diflubenzuron is suspected of being a carcinogen European Chem.News 6 16 , 29 1978 , as it contains a 4 chloroaniline unit in its molecule.An object of the present invention are l benzoyl 3 aryl urea derivatives having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R is chlorine or fluorine R1 is hydrogen, chlorine or fluorine R2 and R3, which are the same or different from each other, represent hydrogen, halogen or alkyl containing to 1 to 4 carbon atoms R4 and R5, which are the same or different from each other, represent hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkenyl, haloalkenyl, alkenyloxy, haloalkenyloxy or alkynyl R6 and R7, which are the same or different from each other, represent hydrogen or alkyl containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by halogen Y represents hydrogen or fluorine n is an integer of from 1 to 4.Among the aforesaid definitions the term halogen preferably refers to a fluorine, chlorine, or bromine atom.The compounds of formula I exhibit insecticide activity and may be used in the agrarian, forestal, civil and veterinary field for combatting insect infestations.In the following description of the preparation of the compounds of formula I the symbols R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5,R6, R7, Y and n havethmeanings indicated for formula I , if not specified otherwise.The compounds of formula I are obtained by reacting a benzoyl isocyanate having the formula EMI2.1 with an dromatic amine having the formula EMI2.2 The reaction does not require the presence of catalysts and is carried out in an inert solvent at a temperature ranging between OOC and the boiling temperature of the mixture.Suitable solvents are e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, ketones and acetonitrile.The benzoyl isocyanates of formula II are known compounds, some of them being commercially available. The amines of formula III may be prepared in a manner known per se, for instance by a reaction of a sodium or potassium salt of a suitable amino phenol IV in a dipolar aprotic solvent with a compound of formula EMI3.1 wherein X is halogen such asC1, Br, J or a tosyl or mesyl group, at a temperature of from 0 to 1500C, according to the following reaction scheme EMI3.2 2 n Y NaX b reduction, according to known techniques, of a nitro derivative of formula EMI3.3 The nitroderivatives of formula VI may in turn be prepared, according to known methods, by reacting a suitable 4 halonitrobenzene VII with a sodium or potassium salt of an alcohol VIII in a solvent system consisting of said alcohol VIII or in an aprotic apolar solvent, or carrying out the reaction according to the phase transfer technique in the presence of a suitable catalyst at tem peratures ranging between 10 and 1500C, according to the following reaction scheme EMI4.1 VII VIII VI CF2 n Y NaX wherein X is halogen.The alcohols of formula VIII are known and may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI4.2 wherein X is halogen and Me is a metal selected from Zn,Mg and Cu.Organometallic compound IX may be prepared by reacting compound X CF2 nX with Zn, Mg or Cu.The nitroderivatives of formula VI , in which at least one of radicals R2, R3, R4 and R5 is chlorine, may also be obtained by direct chlorination with C12 of the corresponding non chlorinated nitroderivatives at temperatures ranging between 25 and 1500C and in the presence of a catalyst such as e.g. Fecal3 and SbC1For those skilled in the art, it is a matter of course that different alternative processes may be used for the synthesis of the intermediates and of the end products having formula Z . An alternative process for the synthesis of the compounds of formula I comprises, for instance, reacting a benzamide of formula EMI5.1 with an isocyanate of formula EMI5.2 This reaction is carried out under conditions similar to those described hereinbefore for the reaction between the benzoyl isocyanate of formula II and the amine of formula III .The preparation of the isocyanates of formula XII involves, however, the preparation, of the amines of formula III and their reaction with phosgene. This aspect, together with the consideration that the benzoyl isocyanates of formula II are commercially available,as the amides of formula XI are, generally renders the method mentioned hereinbefore, namely the reaction between the compounds of formulae II and III more preferable.As mentioned above, the compounds of formula I exhibit high insecticide activity, particularly against larvae and eggs of insects. Among these,insects belonging to the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera, are especially amenable of being combatted by means of the compounds of formula I . These orders comprise many species which are important owing to their noxiousness in the agrarian, forestal, civil and veterinary fields.Therefore, the compounds of formula I are suitable for many different utilities, for instance, for protecting agricultural cultivations against infestations of phytophagous insects, for protecting environments infested with mosquitoes and flies, for protecting breeding cattle against cattle parasites, etc. Furthermore, the compounds of formula I show a collateral acaricide activity.For practical use, the compounds of formula I may be utilized either as such or, more conveniently, in the form of compositions containing, besides one or more of the compounds of formula I as active component, inert solid or liquid carriers and,optionally, other additives.As with conventional formulations, the compositions according to the present invention may be in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, etc. The amount of active component in these compositions may vary within wide ranges 1 95 by weight , depending on the type of composition and on the intended use. If required by particular situations or in order to enlarge the spectrum of activity, other active substances such as e.g. known insecticides or acaricides may be added to the compositions.The amount of active substance compound of formula I to be distributed for the insecticide treatments depends on different factors such as, for instance, the type and degree of infestation, the environment infested agrarian cultivation, basins, water courses, organic substrates of different nature , the type of the composition employed, climatic and environmental factors, the applicator means used, etc. Generally, amounts of the active substance within the range of from 0.01 to 1 kg ha are sufficient for a good disinfestation.
