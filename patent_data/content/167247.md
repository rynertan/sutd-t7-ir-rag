# Method for applying thermoplastic inks to a substrate and a composition for use therein.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for applying a thermoplastic composition as a series of discrete droplets from a non contact ink let printing apparatus to form separate drops on a substrate moving relative to the apparatus, characterised in that the molten composition is thermally stable at the temperature of application and is applied at a temperature in excess of 100 C. The invention can be used to apply the molten composi tion to a variety of substrates using on demand or con tinuous non contact ink jet application techniques. However, the invention is of especial use in the application of thermoplastic inks to non porous substrates using an on demand ink jet printer.
