# METHOD OF, AND SYSTEM FOR, VARYING ADJACENT VIEW PORT SIZES ON A DISPLAY SCREEN

## Abstract
A method of, and system for, managing split screen view ports such that a view into a document can be varied up to an established view area size. A view area is determined and then a divider is called for dividing the view area. Calling of the divider defines a split screen mode for permitting portions of different documents to be viewed adjacent one another. If a larger view of one of the portions is desired, the divider is dynamically and interactively moveable up to view area boundaries.
