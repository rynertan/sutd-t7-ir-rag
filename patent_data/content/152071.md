## Description
Our invention relates to an apparatus for data transfer with interchangeable disklike record media such as a flexible magnetic disk which may be packaged in cassette or cartridge form and which has data storage tracks thereon, said data transfer apparatus having a disk drive motor for imparting rotation to the record medium, and a head transport motor for transporting a transducer head, or a pair of such heads, radially of the record medium for accessing the individual data storage tracks thereon. Our invention is also specifically directed to a method of operation for such a data transfer apparatus. Generally, in data transfer apparatus of the type in question, the head transport motor is what is known as a stepping motor, having a rotor that rotates in short and essentially uniform angular movements, rather continuously, in response to stepping pulses supplied from an external control. The stepwise rotation of the head transport motor is translated by a suitable rotary to linear converter into the linear stepwise motion of the transducer head or heads for track to track accessing on the record disk. A problem has existed with this type of head transport motor in data transfer apparatus. Transported to any desired track position on the record disk, the transducer head or heads must be held in that position until the head transport motor rotates in response to the the next series of stepping pulses. The rotor of the head transport motor must of course be retained in a corresponding angular position with respect to the fixed windings of the motor in order to hold the transducer head or heads in the desired track position. Take, for example, a four phase stepping motor of one phase drive. If the third phase windings of this motor have been energized by the last of the preceding series of stepping pulses, the rotor must be held opposite the third phase windings pending the next series of stepping pulses. A conventional solution to this problem has been to continue, during the absence of stepping pulses, the energization of the head transport motor windings that have been energized by the last of the preceding series of stepping pulses, with a current of either the same magnitude as that during stepping operation or of a smaller magnitude for saving power. We object to the continued energization of the head transport motor as it involves a considerable waste of energy. It is difficult, however, to hold the rotor in the exact angular position required if the motor is energized with a current of the smaller magnitude, and even more difficult if the motor is deenergized. Particularly if the motor is deenergized, the rotor is very likely to be displaced up to approximately 10 to 20 microns from the required angular position, being no longer electromagnetically retained in that position. Such undesired displacement of the rotor, and in consequence of the transducer head or heads with respect to the tracks of the record disk, will also occur because of mechanical vibrations or shocks produced as when the disk drive motor is set into or out of rotation or when the disk is loaded into or unloaded from the apparatus. We have hereby succeeded in eliminating the waste of power due to the continuous energization of the head transport motor in data transfer apparatus of the type under consideration without giving rise to the undesired displacement of the head transport motor rotor with respect to its fixed windings and, therefore, of the transducer head or heads on the disklike record medium for use with the apparatus. Briefly our invention provides a data transfer apparatus of the kind defined at the preamble, which apparatus is improved by including a control and drive circuit for controllably energizing the head transport motor. The control and drive circuit is adapted to impress a first supply voltage, sufficiently high to correct the position of the transducer head on the record medium, to the head transport motor at least during at least part of the period from the moment the disk drive motor is set into rotation to the moment the speed of rotation of the disk drive motor becomes sufficiently high for the commencement of data transfer between the record medium and the transducer head, and during the period when the head transport motor is in rotation to transport the transducer head from track to track on the record medium in response to stepping pulses. The control and drive circuit is further adapted to impress a second supply voltage, lower than the first supply voltage, to the head transport motor at least during at least part of the period from the moment the disk drive motor is set out of rotation to the beginning of said at least part of the period during which the first supply voltage is impressed to the head transport motor. In short, according to our invention summarized above, the control and drive circuit holds the supply voltage of the head transport motor zero, or lower e.g. five volts than its normal operating voltage e.g. Even though the rotor of the head transport motor may be angularly displaced for some reason or other while its supply voltage is being held at zero or lower than its normal operating value, the high operating voltage impressed subsequently to the head transport motor causes the rotor to return to the required angular position. Data transfer can therefore be initiated immediately thereafter with the transducer head or heads exactly in the required track position on the record medium. We have thus attained the objective of saving power without head displacement. The invention further provides a method of operation for the data transfer apparatus of the kind defined in the preamble, said method being defined by the characterizing features of claims 5 and 10, respectively. A similar data transfer apparatus and corresponding method of operation are claimed in EP A 152070. The above and other features and advantages of our invention and the manner of realizing them will become more apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood, from a study of the following description and appended claims, with reference had to the attached drawings showing some preferred embodiments of our invention.
