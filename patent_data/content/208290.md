# Method and apparatus for producing thermoplastic and products produced therefrom.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are disclosed for producing various materials and products of a thermoplastic nature. In the method, thermoplastic material is subjected to a high in tensity mixing and melting step to form a material which is a non flowable and self sustaining mass, having a temperature low enough to prevent it from being readily flowable, in a subsequent step, the method involves placing the material between a fixed rigid surface and a moving rigid surface to force air from the mass and to densify, compress and convert it to a flowable form whereafter it is passed through a restric ted opening. There is provided a combination of a high inten sity mixer and melter in which the product produced is then fed into a gear pump where the material is passed between a fixed rigid surface and a moving surface. Higher output speeds can be obtained using the method and apparatus com pared to conventional extrusion techniques in addition, mat erials not readily processable by conventional extruding oper ations can be processed.
