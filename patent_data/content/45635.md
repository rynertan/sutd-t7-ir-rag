# Electrical remote actuated positioning device.

## Abstract
An actuator assembly, particularly for a motor vehicle rear view mirror, includes a gimballed pivot member having slidably mounted thereon a sphere. The sphere is located between channels formed in first and second slides movable in mutually perpendicular directions to a plane perpendicular to the pivot member to rotate the pivot member in the gimbal. Drive to the slides from electric motors is partially dis engageable against a resilient bias to permit manual movement of the pivot member and to avoid stalling the motors when limits of travel are encountered. The assembly is provided with an impervious housing and the sphere and slides are of lubricious plastics material.
