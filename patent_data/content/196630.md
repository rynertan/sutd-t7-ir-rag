## Description
The present invention relates to a new process for the fluorination in liquid phase of unsaturated compounds. Methods are known for fluorinating unsaturated organic compounds by using elemental fluorine. Fluorinating the double bond is a reaction presenting strong difficulties in practical implementation, due to its highly exothermal character, with the evolution of high amounts of heat, of the order of 107 kcal per each double bond. The high reaction energy can lead to strong increases of the reaction mass temperature, within very short times, and hence difficult to control. Locally the temperature can be so high as to cause the breakage of C C bonds in the product, with the degradation of the same, and the formation of undesired byproducts. Another occurring drawback is the dimerization of the product. In the processes of the prior art, obviating these drawbacks and dangers has been tried by carrying out the fluorinating reaction under easily controllable conditions the most common contrivances are the use of very low reaction temperatures, even as low as 120 C, in particular at the beginning of the process, and or the use of low concentrations of fluorine, which to that purpose is diluted with such inert gases as nitrogen or noble gases helium . These contrivances suffer however from some drawbacks first of all, they extremely reduce the reaction rate, and furthermore, sometimes, the use of low reactivity conditions does not allow the reaction to be conveniently carried out and consequently, when said reaction, after an initial induction time, starts, the amount of fluorine present in the reaction mixture is higherthan its optimum value and can lead to a too fast and uncontrollable reaction. According to the process of the present invention, the fluorination is carried out in liquid phase, at a temperature comprised within the range of from 25 C to 120 C, preferably of from 10 C to 70 C, in the presence of a solvent allowing fluorine concentration to be controlled, and acting as a temperature stabilizer, in such way creating such conditions that fluorine may easily react with no delays consequently, operating is possible with higher fluorine concentrations, thus increasing the reaction rate. Essential conditions of the process are In particular, the products comprised in one of the following structures are suitable Perfluoropolyethers having one or more of the units indicated above for each class can be also used. Particularly suitable perfluoropolyethers of this type are those containing repeating units These compounds are described for example in USP 3,665,041. Perfluoropolyethers of class IV and V are described respectively in USP 4,523,039 and in published EP appln. 148,482. The perfluoropolyethers belonging to the above said classes must have an average molecular weight comprised within the range of from 450 to 5000 and preferably of from 500 to 2000. The process according to the invention is suitable to the fluorinating of perfluorinated linear, cyclic or branched olefins containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, with the condition that the branching is not on adjacent atoms, or of perfluoro vinyl ethers having the general formula Examples of linear olefins which can be used are linear olefins such as n C₅F₁₀, n C₇F₁₄ branched olefins such as Examples of perfluorovinylethers which can be used are The following Examples are given to illustrative pur poses, and are not to be intended as being limitative of the possibilities of practical embodiment of the present invention. The fluorination tests are carried out within a cylindrical photochemical reactor of 250 cc of capacity, provided with a quartz coaxial sheath for housing a 150 W mercury vapour lamp type Hanau TQ 150, moreover provided with a bubbling gas inlet, magnetic stirrer, CCl₃ CO₂ trap, and with a temperature control system both for the reactor and for the sheath system, using perfluorinated liquids type FC 75 . Into the photochemical reactor described above, 150 g of perfluoro 2 methylpentene 3 with minor amounts of perfluoro 2 methylpentene 2, obtained by dimerization, catalyzed by anhydrous KF, of perfluoropropene in acetonitrile, together with 150 g of solvent, constituted by a perfluoropolyether of type I , obtained from perfluoropropene, and having viscosity η 8 cSt at 20 C , are charged. Subsequently, after the turning on of the lamp, the system is kept at the constant temperature of 20 C, and the fluorination is carried out with a fluorine stream of 2.5 l h, diluted with a 7.5 l h nitrogen stream. During 10 hours, the flow rate of fluorine is progressively increased up to 5 l h, and the nitrogen flow rate is reduced to 3 l h. At the end of the reaction, before drawing the product, the fluorine present is removed by means of a nitrogen stream the reaction product is submitted to rectification, and as low boiling products, 2.5 g of unreacted olefin and 16.7 g of 99 perfluoroisohexane perfluoro 2 methyl pentane having boiling point 57 C and formula The residue is the perfluoropolyether used as solvent. Into the same equipment as of Example 1, 60 g of perfluoro 2 methylpentene 3 with minor amounts of perfluoro 2 methylpentene 2 and 240 g of solvent constituted by perfluoropolyether of type I , obtained from perfluoropropene, with viscosity η 8 cSt at 20 C are charged. Subsequently, after the turning on of the lamp, the system is kept at the constant temperature of 20 C, and the fluorination is carried out with a fluorine stream of 2.5 l h, diluted with a 7.5 l h nitrogen stream. During 5 hours, the flow rate of fluorine is progressively increased up to 5 l h, and the nitrogen flow rate is reduced to 5 l h during the same time, the temperature is increased from 20 C to 0 C. At the end of the reaction, after the removal of fluorine, the reaction product is submitted to rectification, and 64.2 g of perfluoro 2 methylpentane yield 95 are obtained.
