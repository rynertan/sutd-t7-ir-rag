# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE HAVING A TRANSISTOR WITH AN INCREASED CURRENT AMPLIFICATION FACTOR, AND PROM COMPRISING THE SAME

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having a lateral transistor consisting of a semiconductor substrate, a first semiconduc tor region, and a second semiconductor region operatively functioning as a collector, a base, and an emitter of a transistor. By providing a high concentration region in the first semiconductor region, the base width of the transistor is narrowed. In a PROM, a reverse current preventing transistor with the narrowed base width in each memory cell can be driven by a decoder driver with a lowered driving power consumption.
