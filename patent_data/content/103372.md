# NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for determining the rate of flow of a liquid in a selected region of a body by nuclear mag netic resonance techniques. The method includes a sequence of applying a first magnetic pulse B₁ 90 effective to excite nuclear magnet ic resonance of a chosen nucleus within the liquid prefer entially in a slice of the body which includes the selected region. A period of time t₀ is waited and then a second magnetic pulse B₁ 90 is applied which is effective to ex cite nuclear magnetic resonance of the nuclei preferentially in the slice, and the free induction decay signal is mea sured. The whole sequence is repeated for different values of the period of time t₀ . The values of the period of time t₀ and the corresponding measured signals are then related to the rate of flow of the liquid through the slice.
