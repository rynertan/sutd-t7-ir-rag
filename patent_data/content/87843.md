# X ray examination apparatus.

## Abstract
In an X ray examination apparatus comprising an image intensifier tube 6 and an optical light distribution system 11 there is included an image field selector, by means of which, using a subbeam 23 diverted from the imaging beam 10 , a measurement field can be selected 24, 45 and by means of which this measurement field or a boundary outline thereof can be projected 46 back into the imaging radiation path 10 . Thus, it is achieved that during an examination stage an indication of the extent and location of a measurement field which is considered to be relevant for controlling 26 the desired exposure for pictures to be produced, can be constantly displayed on the image screen of the television monitor 13 .
