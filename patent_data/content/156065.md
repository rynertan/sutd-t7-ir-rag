# Cleaning diskette for flexible disk drive transducers.

## Abstract
A flexible cleaning disk for universal application in single sided and double sided flexible disk drives has a jacket 11 , a flexible cleaning medium 16 rotatably positioned within the jacket and a removable protective membrane 25 arranged to normally cover one of the jacket access apertures 21 . The protective membrane 25 is a relatively thin flexible member fabricated from .002 inch polyester having a main body por tion 26 positioned within the interior of the jacket 11 bet ween the cleaning medium 16 and the access aperture 21 and a tab portion 27 extending laterally from the main body portion 26 and adhered to the outer surface of the jacket 11 adjacent the access aperture 21 . The relatively thin flexible membrane 25 provides a highly efficient transfer medium for the compressive force applied by the pressure pad assem bly in a single sided drive and the movable transducer assem bly in a double sided drive to the cleaning medium. When used in a double sided drive, the membrane 25 is removed during a second cleaning phase by releasing the tab portion 27 from the jacket 11 surface and withdrawing the main body 26 portion from the access aperture 21 .
