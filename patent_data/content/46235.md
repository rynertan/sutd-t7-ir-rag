# A novel vertical type separator electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a novel vertical type separator electrolytic cell which is comprised of a box shaped structure 1 in which a plurarity of cathode structures are provided, a bot tom plate 15 on which anodes 14 are mounted, a se parator 11 such as a cation exchange membrane posi tioned between the cathode structure and the anode 14 and a cell top cover 20 , said cathode structure compris ing a cathode electroconductor 3 and a cathode 5 positioned along at least one lateral surface of the cathode electroconductor 3 by electroconductive ribs 4 lo cated thereto, thus forming an independent vertical ca thode working surface.
