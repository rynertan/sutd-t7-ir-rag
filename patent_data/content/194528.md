## Description
The invention relates to a printer according to the first portion of claim 1. In a thermal transfer printer, wherein a recording paper and a transfer film of an ink ribbon are laminated between a platen and a thermal head, the transfer film is heated as it is pressed against the recording paper by the thermal head, to melt or sublime a coloring agent on the transfer film and thereby transfer the resultant coloring agent to the recording paper. The thermal transfer printer is advantageous in that the thermal transfer printer does not require a special paper as the object recording paper. However, such a thermal transfer printer is faulty in that the quality of a printed product obtained thereby varies depending upon the smoothness of the surface of the recording paper in use. Namely, when the recording paper is relatively rough, the coloring agent melted or sublimed by the thermal head is deposited on the high areas of the rough surface of the relatively rough recording paper and not spread into the low areas thereof. Consequently, the voids and the transfer failures occur on the printed dots or the transferred dots to cause the quality of the printed product to decrease. Fig. 26 is an enlarged sectional view illustrating the contacting showing a thermal transfer recording operation and condition of a thermal head 1, an ink ribbon 5 and a relatively rough recording paper 13 used as object recording paper. A heating resistor portion 4a of the thermal head 1, which is formed on a partial glaze layer portion 3a consisting of glass, generates the heat at its portion when the electric current is applied thereto through an electrode 7a. This heat is transmitted to the ink ribbon 5 through a protective layer 8. As a result, the solid ink applied to a base film 10 of the ink ribbon 5 is melted, so that the transfer of an image starts. When the relatively rough recording paper 13 as an object recording paper is used, the difference between the top of a peak 13a of the relatively rough recording paper 13 and the bottom of a valley 13b of the relatively rough recording paper 13 is as great as about 10 28 µm as shown in Fig. 26. Therefore, even if the ink layer 11 is melted with the ink ribbon 5 simply applied to such a surface of the relatively rough recording paper 13, the molten ink cannot enter the interior of the valley 13b of the relatively rough recording paper 13, so that the ink is not deposited on the portion of the relatively rough recording paper 13 which has the valley 13b. Accordingly, neither the molten ink nor the sublimed ink are left in the low areas 13b of the relatively rough recording paper 13, they are necessarily left around the high areas 13a of the relatively rough recording paper 13 alone. Figs. 27 and 28 show printed dot 6 per one picture element. Fig. 27 shows an example of the printed image on the relatively rough recording paper 13, and Fig. 28 an example of the printed image on the smooth recording paper. It will be understood that the printed dots 6 on the relatively rough recording paper 13, which has the low transfer rate T As stated above when the relatively rough recording paper 13 is used as the object recording paper in the conventional thermal transfer printer, the quality of the printed product markedly decreases. Namely, when the relatively rough recording paper 13 is use, the ink melted by the thermal head 1 is transferred only to the high areas 13a or the portion of surrounding around the top of the peak 13a on the surface of the relatively rough recording paper 13. A thermal transfer printer according to the first portion of claim 1 is known from the JP U 59 41540. The thermal head of said thermal transfer printer improves the thermal transfer efficiency and consists of a head base, partial glaze layer portions or projections provided on the head base, and heating resistor portions provided on the tops of the partial glaze layer portions. However, the above thermal transfer printer using any of these thermal head is applied to the relatively rough recording paper, a printed product of a sufficiently high quality cannot be obtained, i.e., the above mentioned faults cannot be eliminated. The condition of the head contact in the conventional thermal transfer printer, will be described with reference to Figs. 29 and 30. Figs. 29 and 30 show a principal portion surrounding around the conventional thermal transfer printer, which is provided with a round platen 12 having a hardness H When a thermal head 1 in Fig. 29 is pressed with a force F , the pressing force F is transmitted to the round platen 12 through the ink ribbon 5 and the relatively rough recording paper 13. If the hardness H Increasing the hardness H In the conventional thermal transfer printer, the hardness H According to the results of experiments made by the inventors of the present invention, the relation between the unit area surface pressure P from the thermal head and a transfer rate T The unit area surface pressure P in the conventional thermal transfer printer of this kind is around 0.1 kg mm², and the transfer rate T The construction of a platen having a flat portion for a thermal transfer printer is disclosed in the JP U 157642 1983. This platen is a platen having a combination of a flat portion and a curved portion. As shown in this laid open publication, the characteristics of this platen reside in that the platen has at least one curved surface portion and a flat surface portion continuing tangentially from the curved surface portion. Even on the platen which has the flat surface portion the platen shown in this publication, the contacting of a glaze layer portion of the thermal head occurs if the hardness H An object of the present invention is to provide a printer having a thermal head wherein a high quality printed product can be obtained even when the relatively rough recording paper or the heat sensitive paper is used as the object paper, especially by utilizing a platen having a proper rubber hardness. This object will be solved by the featurs of claim 1. The high areas of the surface of the recording paper which are opposite the heating resistor portion of the thermal head are flattened to increase the smoothness of the surface of the recording paper and thereby enable the coloring agent on the transfer film to be transferred uniformly to the recording paper in case of the thermal transfer printer. According to the invention, the unit area surface pressure P applied from the heating resistor portion of the thermal head to the recording paper or the heat sensitive paper is set to not less than 0.3 kg mm². The unit area surface pressure P is defined as the pressing force F divided by truly contacting area between the glaze layer portion of the thermal head and the recording paper or the heat sensitive paper. Therefore, the transfer recording operation in the thermal transfer printer is done as the glaze layer portion on the recording paper, which is opposite the heating resistor portion and is flattened to increase the smoothness of the surface of the recording paper. This enables a high quality printed product to be obtained even when the relatively rough recording paper is used as the object recording paper. The invention has been developed on the basis of the following concept so as to solve the previously stated various problems of the prior art. Namely, the contact unit area surface pressure P on only the portion, which is the peak surrounding portion or the high area portion, of the relatively rough recording paper that is necessary for carrying out a transfer recording operation is increased to the high level by utilizing the elastic deformation of the relatively rough recording paper, to momentarily depress the high area portion during the transfer recording operation of an image thereby smoothing the surface of the relatively rough recording paper. Accordingly, it is strictly necessary that the platen be formed so as not to be deformed in as many cases as possible by the pressing force F from the thermal head. It has been ascertained by experiments of the inventors of the present invention that, when the platen is deformed, it becomes substantially impossible to obtain a high quality printed image on the relatively rough recording paper. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the relation between the unit area surface pressure P and the transfer rate T It has been discovered that, in order to obtain the transfer rate T Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a thermal head 1. The thermal head 1 is provided on its head base 2, which is formed of an insulating material, such as a ceramic material, with four partial glaze layer portions 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d which only two heating resistor layer portions 4a and 4b are provided on the tops of the two inner glaze layer portions 3b and 3c. The glaze layer portions 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d extent at right angle to the direction in which the thermal head 1 is moved. Fig. 3 shows the head contacting between the thermal head 1, which has the height H of the glaze layer portions 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d, and a platen 62. The platen 62 has at a depth of indentation Di therein. Fig. 4 shows the necessary hardness H It is understood from Fig. 4 that, in order to bring the partial glaze layer portions 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d of the thermal head 1 alone into contact with the platen 62 with no parts of the thermal head 1 contacting the platen 62, the hardness H It is necessary to provide a platen, especially a platen with a flat surface portion in advance, and maintain the hardness H In order to increase the recording paper unit area surface pressure P of the heating resistor portion of the thermal head, it is also important to set the hardness H Consequently, the unit area surface pressure P of the portion of the thermal head which is other than the heating resistor portion thereof increases. This makes it necessary to apply the larger pressing force F to the thermal head for the purpose of obtaining a desired unit area surface pressure P . Accordingly, it becomes necessary to increase the carriage driving force of the thermal transfer printer. If a platen of an excessively high hardness H Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the relation between the pressing force F and the transfer width W Conventional platens of the thermal transfer printer mostly have a hardness H According to Fig. 5 even if the pressing force F is increased to enlarge the transfer area, the rubber of the platen is deformed greatly, and the recording paper is also deformed in accordance with the deformation of the rubber of the platen. Consequently, it is evident that the unit area surface pressure P decreases, and that it becomes impossible to secure a necessary transfer width W The hardness H One embodiment of the thermal transfer printer according to the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 6. Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a thermal transfer printer according to the present invention. A shaft 38 and a stay 34 are fixed between side plates 24 and 40. A carriage 32 is provided slidably on the shaft 38 and the stay 34. An ink ribbon cassette 30 and a thermal head 1 are mounted on the carriage 32, and an ink ribbon 5 or a rolled transfer film 5 is housed in the ink ribbon cassette 30. A carriage driving motor 26 is adapted to move the carriage 32 to left and right via a timing belt 44. A line feed motor 20 is adapted to transmit the driving force to a gear 18, which is connected to the shaft of a paper feed roller 63, to feed a recording paper 13. The recording paper 13 runs between the paper feed roller 63 and a holding roller 64 and into a space between a flat platen 62 and the ink ribbon 5 via a platen support member 61. The recording paper 13 can also be fed in the same by turning a paper feed roller knob 22 by hand. A paper guide 42 is adapted to guide the recording paper 13 being wound around the flat platen 62. The paper holding rollers 14, which are adapted to press the recording paper 13 against the flat platen 62, are mounted slidably on a shaft 15. A release lever 16 is moved forward and backward to move the shaft 15 toward and away from the shaft 15, and thereby press the recording paper 13 against the flat platen 62 or release the recording paper 13. Reference numeral 28 denotes a flat cable for supplying a control signal and the electric power for controlling the generation of heat in the thermal head 1, and 36 a home position sensor. A control circuit 80 is adapted to receive a signal from the home position sensor 36 and control the carriage driving motor 26, the line feed motor 20 and the thermal head 1. This thermal transfer printer is such a printer of a one way printing system in which the printing is done only whole the carriage 32 is moved to right. Accordingly, the ink ribbon 5 is taken up only while the carriage 32 is moved to right. The thermal head 1 will now be described more in detail as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 26. The heating resistor layer portion 4a is provided to cover the glaze layer portion 3b of a glass material on the head base 2, and an electric current is applied to a portion A of the heating resistor layer portion 4a by electrodes 7a and 7b to generate the heat therein. The surfaces of the heating resistor layer portion 4a and electrodes 7a and 7b are covered with a protective layer portion 8. Accordingly, the heat from the heating resistor layer portion 4a is transmitted to the ink ribbon 5 through the protective layer portion 8. The ink ribbon 5 is formed of a base film 10, and the ink layer portion 11 of thermally meltable ink which is formed on the base film 10. The ink layer portion 11 is melted with the heat generated in the thermal head 1, to be deposited on or transferred to the recording paper 13. In this embodiment, the hardness H In this embodiment, the unit area surface pressure P applied from the thermal head 1 to the portion of the recording paper 13 which is in a region in which the thermal transfer is carried out is set to not less than 0.3 kg mm² so as to flatten the peak or projection on the surface of the relatively recording paper 13 and increase the smoothness of the surface of the relatively rough recording paper 13. Thus, the occurrence of molten ink non deposited portions such as the voids and the transfer failures is prevented. The unit area surface pressure P from the thermal head 1 is generated by the electromagnetic force of a solenoid or the force of a spring. Accordingly, the unit area surface pressure P is set to the above mentioned level by regulating the level of the electric current supplied to the solenoid or the force of the spring. However, if the unit area surface pressure P is set to not less than 0.3 kg mm² as in the embodiment of the present invention, the transfer rate T A flat platen for the recording paper of a low smoothness according to the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 7 and 8. The condition of the head contact in the thermal transfer printer according to the present invention is shown as Figs. 7 and 8. The hardness Hs of rubber of the flat platen 62 according to the present invention is increased so that the surface of the flat platen 62 is not deformed greatly by the pressing force F . As a result, the pressing force F is transmitted to the four partial glaze layer portions 3 on the thermal head 1, and the ink ribbon 5 is pressed by the four partial glaze layer portions 3. Thus, the contacting condition of the ink ribbon 5, the recording paper 13 and the flat platen 62 is improved, and their unit area surface pressure P increases, to enable the printing on the relatively rough recording paper 13. This indicates that the close contacting capability of the thermal head 1 is the most important factor among the head contact problems. Fig. 9 shows the pressing relation between the flat platen 62 and the partial glaze layer portion 3 provided on the thermal head 1. Especially, when the flat platen 62 is formed on the platen support member 61 by the vapor deposition with the hardness Hs of rubber of the platen platen 62 at not less than Hs 50 When the apparent unit area surface pressure P is increased by utilizing the rigidity of the platen support member 61 with the hardness H Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate an example view of a method of attaching the flat platen 62 to the platen support member 61, respectively. Fig. 10 shows a structure in which a projection part 62a integrally formed with the flat platen 62 is pressure fitted into a plurality of bores made in the platen support member 61. Fig. 11 shows a structure in which the flat platen 62 is fixed to the platen support member 61 by the vapor deposition or with the bonding material. Reference numeral 90 denotes a vapor deposition layer portion or a bonded surface layer portion. Fig. 12 shows the relation between the partial glaze layer portion portion 3 on the thermal head 1 for obtaining a proper unit area surface pressure P and the heating resistor layer portion 4. In order to secure a proper unit area surface pressure P , it is ideal that the length W₂ of a row of dotted heating resistor layer portion 4 and the length W₁ of the partial glaze layer portion 3 be set equal but setting the lengths W₂ , W₁ in this manner causes a decrease in the quality of the printed product due to the widely scattered values of the dimensional accuracy. Therefore, according to the embodiment of the present invention, these lengths are set to around 1.2 W₂ W₁ 1.4 W₂ so as to obtain a high quality printed product. The dimensions thus set of the heating resistor layer portion 4 and the partial glaze layer portion 3 satisfy the conditions for obtaining a high quality printed product. As described above, in order to secure a high quality of the printed image on the relatively rough recording paper, it is most important to obtain a close contact relation between the thermal head, the ink ribbon and the relatively rough recording paper. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the printing even on the relatively rough recording paper as an object recording paper, can be done substantially in the same manner as the printing on the normally smooth recording paper, and the high quality printed product can be obtained. Especially, since the flat platen is used, the quantity of rubber of the flat platen in use can be reduced greatly in comparison with that in the case where a round platen is used. This enables the manufacturing cost to be also reduced greatly. Owing to the use of the flat platen, a compact thermal transfer printer can be obtained. The embodiment of the present invention is directed to the thermal transfer printer having a construction which fully satisfies the conditions for bring the thermal head, the ink ribbon and the relatively rough recording paper into close contact with one another. This construction can also be used in a thermal printer having a heat sensitive paper. Another embodiment of the thermal transfer printer according to the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 13. In this embodiment as shown in Fig. 13, a round platen 12 is used as a platen. The difference between the embodiment as shown in Fig. 13 and the precedent embodiment as shown in Fig. 6 is the platen structure. Namely the round platen 12 is adapted in fig. 13 and on the other hand the flat platen 62 is adapted in Fig. 6. The reference numerals in Fig. 13, of the same parts of the thermal transfer printer indicate the same parts shown in Fig. 6. The round platen 12 is adapted to be turned when a gear 18 mounted on the shaft thereof is driven by a line feed motor 20, to thereby feed the recording paper 13. The round platen 12 can also be turned by manually turning a platen knob 22. A paper guide 42 is adapted to guide the recording paper 13 being wound around the round platen 12. The paper holding rollers 14, which are adapted to press the recording paper 13 against the round platen 12, are mounted slidably on a shaft 15. A release lever 16 is moved forward and backward to move the shaft 15 toward and away from the shaft 15, and thereby press the recording paper 13 against the round platen 12 or release the recording paper 13. In this embodiment, the round platen 12 consists of rubber having a hardness Hs of Hs 40 Figs. 14 to 25 are plan views and sectional views of modified examples of the thermal head 1, which are suitably used to obtain a preferable unit area surface pressure P , respectively. The modified example of Figs. 14 and 15 is formed by providing two glaze layer portions 3b and 3c on the central portions of the head base 2, and also two heating resistor portions 4a and 4b on the central portions of the upper surface of the glaze layer portions 3b and 3c. In this example, the number of glaze layer portions 3a and 3d is reduced as compared with the thermal head of shown in Fig. 2, so that the great unit area surface pressure P can be obtained even when the small pressing force F is applied to the thermal head 1. Since the glaze layer portions 3b and 3c are formed semi cylindrically, the ink ribbon 5 is not broken by the edge of the head base 2. The modified example of Figs. 16 and 17 is formed by providing two glaze layer portions 3b and 3c on both end portions of the head base 2, and two heating resistor portions 4a and 4b on the central portions of the upper surfaces of the glaze layer portions 3b and 3c. This enables the unit area surface pressure P at the heating resistor portions 4a and 4b to be increased, and the breakage of the ink ribbon 5 to be prevented. The modified example of Figs. 18 and 19 is formed by providing two dummy glaze layer portions 3a and 3d , of a height h smaller than a height H of the other two glaze layer portions 3b and 3c. This enables the unit area surface pressure P at two heating resistor portions 4a and 4b to be increased, and the breakage of the ink ribbon 5 to be prevented. The modified example of Figs. 20 and 21 is formed by setting the length ℓ of four glaze layer portions 3a , 3b, 3c and 3d larger than the width R of the ink ribbon 5 so as to prevent the ink ribbon 5 from being hurt by the edges at both end portions of two glaze layer portions 3a and 3d , and also a printed product prevent from being stained with the coloring agent from the ink ribbon 5. The modified example of Figs. 22 and 23 is formed by providing with two independent glaze layer portions 3b and 3c and two heating resistor portions 4a and 4b for different picture elements on the base head 2. The modified example of Figs. 24 and 25 is formed by further providing with two independent dummy glaze layer portions 3a and 3d on both end portions of the head base 2 in addition to the example shown as Figs. 22 and 23.
