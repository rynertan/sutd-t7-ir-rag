## Abstract
A freezer compartment has a main evaporator 29 and an auxiliary evaporator 30 connected by piping with the main evaporator, and an opening 9 at the back. The main evaporator is fitted on the inside of a back cover 10 which closes off the opening such that both evaporators can be inserted into an inner freezing compartment 3 through the opening. A support member 11 is fitted along the upper rim of the opening at the back to reinforce the top of the cover which closes the opening.
