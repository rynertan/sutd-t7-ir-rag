# Electronical unlocking method and system.

## Abstract
The electronical locking unlocking system by which a door can be unlocked when a single switch is depressed repeatedly by an operator in time with a musical rhythm which he knows or in accordance with a Morse type code. The electronical locking unlocking system according to the present invention comprises a single switch 10 for generat ing a predetermined series of on time interval and off time interval signals, a first counting unit 11 for counting the on time intervals, a second counting unit 12 for counting the off time intervals, a memory unit 14 for previously storing reference ratios of on time intervals to off time intervals, a calculating unit 13 for dividing the counted on time intervals by the counted off time intervals, a compa rating unit 15 for comparing the calculated values with the reference values, a third counting unit 16 for counting the number of accurate on off ratios up to a predetermined number, and an unlocking actuator 1 7 .
