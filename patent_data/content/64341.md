# COMMODITY DISPLAY FOR WEIGHING SCALE

## Abstract
A combined weighing scale and label printer for weighing a packaged commodity 15 includes a scale 10 , a keyboard 60 , a display 70 , a controller 40 and a label printer 30 . Memory means 170 within the controller contains a commodity name and other relevant product information. The operator may interrogate the memory means by a keyboard entry at any time to obtain a human readable verification of the commodity name prior to printing a label 80 . Since the commodity name may be longer than the individual elements which comprise the display means, the commodity may be displayed in a rotating or running fashion from right to left.
