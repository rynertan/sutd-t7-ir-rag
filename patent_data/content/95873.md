# Region specific determinants for vitamin K dependent bone protein.

## Abstract
A novel oligopeptide has between 10 and 16 amino acids and mimics that structure of a corresponding sequence of human bone Gla protein hBGP it may have up to four amino acids different from the hBGP sequence but only one such difference may involve an exchange other than between Phe and Tyr or between Glu and Gla. The oligopeptide is used as a reagent or in the preparation of reagents in relation to gamma carboxy glutamic acid containing protein of bone. Particularly, labeled oligopeptides and antibodies prepared from immunogen conju gates are disclosed for use in immunoassays.
