# Vehicle suspension system.

## Abstract
A vehicle suspension system comprises suspension units 2 with double acting hydraulic actuators 12 for carrying the road wheels 4 . Signals from transducers sensing actuator load and actuator piston position 14, 15 are used in a control system 5 to generate signals representing forces corresponding to heave, pitch, roll and warp modes of vehicle movement and control signals are generated for supply to servo valves 18 associated with the actuators to obtain desired vehicle attitude. The control signals can be modified by signals representing vehicle speed and lateral and longitudinal acceleration and under selective control of the driver.
