# Control system for an engine driven AC generator

## Abstract
A logic circuit determines whether the generator output should be at a high or low level in dependence on electrical load signals S1, S2 and a switching arrangement Tr produces one of two reference levels VS. Comparator CMP compares the battery voltage VB with reference voltage VS and issues a signal to controller CNT indicating whether the generator field current FC should be at a high or low level to charge the battery to the desired level. To avoid sudden excessive loads on the engine the controller compares a present ON time of the high field current with a previous time value and when the difference exceeds a predetermined amount temporarily forces the field current to the OFF level.
