# The representation of character images in a compact form for computer storage.

## Abstract
There have been many approaches to the storage of representations of characters in a computer but no really satisfactory solution exists for storing the very large number of Chinese characters which are in use. According to the invention the strokes of the characters are classified into regular strokes including horizontal, ver tical and turn strokes mainly composed of straight seg ments, and irregular strokes in the form of curves, and different compressed representations are used respective ly for regular strokes, a 24 to 48 bits compressed re presentation is used to describe the beginning X, Y coor dinates, length, width, starting feature, ending feature turn ing feature and slant, and for irregular strokes, e. g of Chinese characters and characters of other languages, a series of vectors ap proximately straight segments are used to approximate to its curved contour with each vector represented by directed increments of X, Y coordinates and a number of different cases of increments are discriminated to make the re presentation more compact. Such an arrangement provides compact storage par ticularly since it is possible to scale the stored representa tion to provide from a single basic size any other desired size. The representation can be transformed into a dot ma trix which is in turn used to form a page layout to provide input for a laser typesetting system.

## Description
This invention relates to the compressed representation of high resolution characters, especiallyChinese characters and other ideographic characters, in computer storage and to the transforming of this compressed representation into a high resolution dot matrix in a manner especially suitable for raster output. This invention is particularly useful in connection with a fast, high resolution, character generator and typesetting controller in a computerized laser system for typesetting books and newspapers in Chinese as well as in other languages, but it also has application to a CRT typesetter. Up to now, it has been very difficult to represent efficiently high resolution Chinese character images in computer storage. In book and newspaper publications, high printing quality is of prime importance and as a result resolution should be over 25 lines mm. Moreover, numerous typefaces and sizes are needed in typesetting. The most advanced fourth generation laser typesetter has a series of advantages including the prospect of direct plate making, but there are some problems caused by the raster output nature of laser system. Unlike a CRT, a laser output device cannot change its dot size instantly during scanning and therefore different sizes of the same character must be represented by different dot matrices.If the resolution is 29.3 lines mm, various sizes of characters needed in typesetting Chinese newspapers and their corresponding dot matrices are as follows EMI2.1 tb SEP character SEP size tb SEP dot SEP matrix tb in SEP point SEP in SEP mm2 SEP tb SEP 56 SEP 19.66 SEP 576 SEP x SEP 576 tb SEP 48 SEP 16.86 SEP 494 SEP x SEP 494 tb SEP 42 SEP 14.74 SEP 432 SEP x SEP 432 tb SEP 36 SEP 12.63 SEP 370 SEP x SEP 370 tb SEP 31.5 SEP SEP 11.06 SEP 324 SEP x SEP 324 tb SEP 28 SEP 9.83 SEP 288 SEP x SEP 288 tb SEP 21 SEP SEP 7.37 SEP 216 SEP x SEP 216 tb SEP 18 SEP 6.28 SEP 184 SEP x SEP 184 tb SEP 15.75 SEP 5.53 SEP 162 SEP x SEP 162 tb SEP 14 SEP 4.91 SEP 144 SEP x SEP 144 tb SEP 12 SEP 4.23 SEP 124 SEP x SEP 124 tb SEP 10.5 SEP 3.68 SEP 108 SEP x SEP 108 tb SEP 9 SEP 3.14 SEP 92 SEP x SEP 92 tb SEP 7.875 SEP 2.76 SEP 82 SEP x SEP 82 tb SEP 7 SEP 2.46 SEP 72 SEP x SEP 72 tb SEP 6 SEP 2.12 SEP 62 SEP x SEP 62 tb Over ten typefaces are frequently used in Chinese publications. They are Song, imitation Song, display Song for headline , boldface, regular script, long Song, shortSong, long boldface, short boldface, long imitation Song etc.Each typeface must contain over 8,000 different Chinese characters. As a result the total storage requirement for all the Chinese characters in different typefaces and sizes used in Chinese publications would be well over 2 x 109 bytes. Therefore efficient representation of high resolutionChinese characters becomes a crucial problem in developing aChinese typesetting system. Prior to the present invention, a run length coding technique has been widely used to represent high resolution character images by a lot of typesetters including the CRT typesetter known as Digisit from Hell Corporation in WestGermany, the IBM full page typesetter used in the Japanese newspaper The Economic News and the Laser Comp of BritishMonotype Corporation. Instead of storing the whole dot matrix of a character, it only records the beginning and the length of separate black sections in each horizontal or vertical line of the character. The original dot matrix of the character can be faithfully reproduced and the storage required can be reduced by one half. The main drawbacks of this approach are, however, poor data compression ratio and the difficulty of generating different sizes of a character from a single representation.Using this method, different sizes of the same font would occupy separate storage areas of the disc and a 80 M bytes disc can only store 60,000 Chinese characters in different typefaces and sizes. The low access speed of removable discs limits the capability of supplying character images to some 25 characters second and becomes the bottleneck of the typesetting system. Another approach developed in Japan and Taiwan regards Chinese characters as composed of several hundred radicals. Only radicals are stored in the computer memory and a Chinese character is generated by addressing its component radicals and putting them in appropriate positions.The overall data compression ratio is good, but distortion and degradation in quality caused by above composition method are entirely unacceptable to the Chinese printing industry. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a data compression technique for high resolutionChinese characters which can dramatically reduce storage requirement without any degradation in output quality. According to the invention there is provided a representation of character images of a resolution of from 17 to at least 50, and preferably from 20 to 40, lines per millimeter in a compact form in which the strokes of the characters are classified into regular strokes including horizontal, vertical and turn strokes mainly composed of straight segments, and irregular strokes in the form of curves, and different compressed representations are used respectively for the regular strokes, a 24 to 48 bits compressed representation is used to describe the beginning X, Y coordinates, length, width, starting feature, ending feature, turning feature and slant, and for irregular strokes, e.g. of Chinese characters and characters of other languages, a series of vectors approximately straight segments are used to approximate to its curved contour with each vector represented by directed increments, i.e. increments given a sign, of X, Y coordinates wherein different cases of increments such as three, e.g.less than 8, less than 16 and not less than 16, are discriminated to make the representation more compact. The strokes of Chinese characters in printing can be classified into two kinds, the regular stroke consisting of horizontal, vertical and turn strokes and the irregular stroke. The former accounts for over half of the strokes occurring in Chinese characters according to statistics. The regular strokes are composed of straight segments and starting, ending and turning features which are regular in shape and it can be precisely described by only 3 to 6 bytes of information. According to one feature of the invention a basic size is selected from which all other sizes can be reproduced. By way of example, 10.5 point or 3.68 mm2 can be selected as a basic size in this invention. Characters of basic size are considered to be drawn on a grid with 96 x 96 units. To represent Song typeface, imitation Song typeface, display Song typeface and boldface Chinese characters, the vertical strokes can be represented by 32 to 40 bits information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length, c 2 to 4 bits width, d 2 to 5 bits ordinal number of a starting feature, and e less than 4 bits ordinal number of an ending feature. The horizontal strokes of Song typeface and displaySong typeface Chinese characters can be represented by 24 to 32 bits information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length, c 2 to 4 bits ordinal number of ending feature d optional 1 or 2 bits designating width variation of the horizontal stroke, and e an optional bit indicating whether a standard starting. feature is present. The horizontal strokes of boldface Chinese characters can be represented by 24 to 32 bits of information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length, c 3 or 4 bits designating width, and d optional 3 to 6 bits describing the slant edge. The horizontal strokes of imitation Song typefaceChinese characters in which the horizontal strokes are equally divided into left half part and right half part can be represented by 32 to 40 bits of information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length, c 1 or 2 bits designating width at the central point of the horizontal stroke, d 1 to 3 bits designating the variation of the left edge i.e. the starting feature , e 1 to 3 bits designating the slant of the lower edge of the left half part, f 1 to 3 bits designating the slant of the lower edge of the right half part, and g 2 to 4 bits ordinal number of the ending feature. The turn strokes of Song typeface and display Song typeface Chinese characters can be represented by 40 to 48 bits of information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length of vertical part of the turn stroke, c length of horizontal part of the turn stroke, d 2 to 4 bits width of vertical part, e 3 to 5 bits ordinal number of turning feature, f 2 or 3 bits ordinal number of ending feature, g optional 1 or 2 bits designating width variation of the horizontal part, h optional 1 or 2 bits indicating whether the right edge of the vertical part is slant and the degree of slant, and i an optional bit indicating whether a standard starting feature is present. The turn strokes of boldface Chinese characters can be represented by 40 bits of information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length of vertical part, c length of horizontal part, d width of vertical part, and e width of horizontal part. The turn strokes of imitation Song typeface Chinese characters can be represented by 40 to 48 bits of information comprising a the beginning X, Y coordinates, b length of vertical part, c length of horizontal part, d width of vertical part, e width of horizontal part, f 3 to 5 bits for the ordinal number of the turning feature, g 2 to 4 bits indicating whether the vertical part is slanted and the degree of slanting, h 1 to 3 bits designating the slant of the horizontal part, and i 2 to 4 bits ordinal number of the ending feature. The horizontal stroke of Song typeface and displaySong typeface Chinese characters is described in the accompanying Figure 1. In most cases, it can be represented by 24 bits as follows stroke identifier 1 bit 0 means horizontal stroke, n 1 means other regular strokes, beginning X coordinate 6 bit , beginning Y coordinate 7 bit , length 7 bit ending feature 3 bit . According to statistics, there are only 5 or 6 different shapes of ending feature because of the regularity of the horizontal stroke. These different shapes of ending feature can be stored in main memory beforehand and represented by a 3 bit ordinal number in the 24 bit compressed representation. There is only one standard starting feature for all horizontal strokes of Song and display Song typefaces and it can be generated automatically by hardware. The normal width of the horizontal stroke is 2 units on a 96 x 96 grid. When the beginning X coordinate exceeds 64, or the horizontal stroke does not have a starting feature, or it has an abnormal width, then three bits normally designating ending feature in the above 24 bit representation are set to all ones and an additional 8 bits are needed to represent these seldom situations with one bit for the most significant bit of 7 bit beginning X coordinate, one bit indicating whether a starting feature exists, 2 bits designating width variation, and 3 bits designating ending feature. The horizontal stroke with a flat edge in boldfaceChinese characters is described in Figure 2. It can be represented by 24 bits as follows stroke identifier l bit , beginning X coordinate 6 bit , beginning Y coordinate 7 bit , length 7 bit , width 3 bit . There are 7 different values of width, from 5 to 11 units on a 96 x 96 grid. For the horizontal stroke with a beginning X coordinate which is greater than 64, or for the horizontal stroke with a slant edge in boldface Chinese characters depicted in Figure 3, an additional 8 bits are required to denote the most significant bit of 7 bit beginning X coordinate and describe the length and width variation of the slant edge. The vertical stroke of Song typeface, display Song typeface and imitation Song typeface is described in Figure 4. It can be represented by 32 bits as follows stroke identifier 2 bit 10 means turn stroke, 11 means vertical strokes, beginning X coordinate 7 bit , beginning Y coordinate 7 bit , length 7 bit , width 2 or 3 bit 2 bit for Song and imitation Song, 3 bit for display Song, starting feature 4 bit , ending feature 2 or 3 bit 2 bit for display Song, 3 bit for Song and imitation Song. The shapes of various starting and ending features are stored in memory and the corresponding ordinal number is included in the 32 bit compressed representation. When a regular stroke has a curved extension, the compressed representation of the curved extension, which is in the form of an irregular stroke without the information about X, Y coordinates of the starting point, should preferably follow immediately the compressed representation of that regular stroke to reduce the information required. The vertical stroke with a flat edge in boldfaceChinese characters, which is depicted in Figure 5, can be represented by 32 bits similar to that of display Song typeface. For the vertical stroke with a slant edge described in Figure 6, an additional 8 bits are required. The turn stroke of boldface is rather simple as depicted in Figure 7 and can be represented by 40 bits. The turn stroke of Song typeface and display Song typeface as depicted in Figure 8 and Figure 9 can be represented by 40 bits stroke identifier 2 bit , beginning X coordinate 7 bit , beginning Y coordinate 7 bit , length of vertical part 7 bit , length of horizontal part 7 bit , width of vertical part 2 or 3 bit 2 bits for Song typeface, width of horizontal part 1 bit only for Song typeface, turning feature 3 bit up to 8 different shapes for each width value, ending feature 2 bit , slant indicator 1 bit indicating whether the right edge of upright part is slant, starting feature indicator 1 bit indicating whether a standard starting feature exists. The horizontal stroke of imitation Song typeface as described in Figure 9 can be regarded as equally divided into left half and right half part with possibly a different degree of slant and is represented by 32 bits stroke identifier l bit beginning X coordinate 6 bit , beginning Y coordinate 7 bit , length 7 bit , width of the stroke at the central point 1 bit , ending feature 4 bit , variation of the left edge 2 bit , slant of the lower edge of the left half part 2 bit , slant of the lower edge of the right half part 2 bit . Here the left edge is a straight segment with identical increments in X and Y directions. According to statistics, there are four different increments 2 to 5 units on a 96 x 96 grid . The slant of the lower edge can be measured by the difference between Y coordinate of the start point of the edge and that of the end point of the edge. The turn stroke of imitation Song typeface is depicted in Figure 10. Corresponding bits are required in the 40 bit or 48 bit representation to describe the slant of the vertical part as well as the horizontal part. Vertical stroke and turn stroke may have a curved extension in the lower part as shown in Figure 11. When the 2 or 3 bits normally designating the ending feature are all ones, it means that the vertical stroke or turn stroke has a curved extension represented in the form of irregular stroke, which will be illustrated later. The advantages of using the above compressed representations for regular strokes are the precise description of the outline whilst still using extremely compact information and precise quality control when different sizes of character are generated from a single internal representation. Turning now to the compressed representation of irregular stroke in Chinese characters and characters of other languages, irregular stroke can be represented by a series of variable length and direction vectors, i.e. vectors whose sign positive or negative gives direction, which approximate to the curved contour, and if the error caused by the approximation is controlled to less than half a unit on a grid with 96 x 96 units, we have found that output quality will not be significantly impaired. Two examples of irregular strokes are shown inFigure 12. On the right of Figure 12, a point is represented by a sequence of vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH, HI, IJ, JA with point A as start point of the stroke. The start point of a stroke is expressed as X, Y coordinates and each vector is expressed as signed, i.e. plus or minus, increments of X, Y coordinates X,tY . Using theX, Y coordinates in Figure 12, the shape of the point shown on the right of Figure 12 may be represented as follows 15, 59 3, 3 2, 5 1, 5 3, 2 4, 1 3, 3 0, 3 3, 3 7, 4. Here the last vector JA is not required in the compressed representation because it can be generated automatically by the character generator. As can be seen, all X and Y increments in the above representation are less than 8, but the direction of vectors varies frequently.Statistics show that this situation often occurs in many irregular strokes of Chinese characters such asa point and so its representation should be made more compact. Preferably the invention uses a control byte to discriminate cases of vectors length, e.g. three cases can be distinguished less than 8, less than 16 and not less than 16. 1. If the first two bits of the control byte are 00, it means that the subsequent N vectors lie in the same quadrant and the increments of each vector are less than 16, where N is designated by the last four bits of the control byte and the quadrant is designated by the middle two bits.Each of the subsequent N bytes represents a vector with four bits defining the absolute value of AX 0 15 and four bits for that of aY 0 15 . 2. If the first two bits of the control byte are 01, it means that the increments of each of the subsequent N vectors are less than 8, where N is designated by the last five or six bits of the control byte. Each of the subsequentN bytes represents a vector with two bits defining the quadrant in which the vector lies, three bits defining the absolute value of AX 0 7 , and three bits for the absolute value of bY 0 7 . 3. If the first two bits of the control byte are 10, it means that either AX or tY of the present vector may be greater than or equal to 16. The remaining six bits of the control byte combined with the subsequent byte represent a vector whose increment may be greater than equal to 16 but less than 64. 4. If the first two bits of the control byte are 11, it means the start point of an irregular stroke. The remaining six bits of control byte combined with the subsequent byte define the X and Y coordinates of the start point. For example, the irregular stroke point on the right of Figure 12 consisting of 10 vectors can be represented by the following 12 bytes X, Y coordinates of start point A 2 bytes , control byte beginning with 01 which defines the number 9, 9 bytes represent 9 vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH, HI, IH . As another example, the irregula stroke on the left of Figure 12 consisting of 11 vectors can be represented by the following 14 bytes X, Y coordinates of start point a 2 bytes , control byte beginning with 00 which defines the number 4 and the third quadrant, 4 bytes represent 4 vectors ab, bc, cd, de , control byte beginning with 00 which defines the number 6 and the first quadrant, 6 bytes represent 6 vectors ef, fg, gh, hi, ij, jk . Using the above compressed representations for regular and irregular strokes, the storage required by a 10.5 point Chinese character is reduced to 100 bytes in average according to statistics based on 7,000 different Song typeface Chinese characters, yet the output quality has not been degraded in the least. The compressed representation achieved has then to be transformed into a corresponding dot matrix and so according to another aspect of the invention the procedure comprises a reducing a representation of regular strokes, e.g. the very compact representation achieved as described above, to a sequence of vectors which approximate to the contour of that regular stroke with each vector expressed as an 8 bit signed AX and 8 bit signed AY, and reducing the three different representations of vector series in an irregular stroke to a unified form in which each vector is expressed as an 8 bit signed ssX and 8 bit signed AY, during this step the vectors can be scaled to give characters of the required size, as will be described below, b transforming each sequence of vectors in the unified form into marked dot matrix in which each dot position occupies two bits marking one of the four situations of that dot 1 beginning of black section 3 mark , 2 end of black section E mark , 3 isolated black dot I mark , 4 vacancy V mark , and c transforming the marked dot matrix into a final dot matrix to be outputted. This procedure can be performed for example, by a microprogram stored in a bipolar PROM Programmable Read OnlyMemory . The algorithm used to transform a vector into approximate digitized dots in procedure b above is described below. For the vector whenAX AY, X is varied incremented or decremented by 1 in each step whether Y is varied is determined through addition and comparison. From the start point of the vector with initial Acc O. In each step, Acc AY a Acc, then Acc is compared with AX if Acc X, then Y is varied incremented or decremented by 1 and Acc AX Acc, continue to next step, if Acc EX, then Y remains unchanged, continue to next step. The above operation is performed until the number of steps being executed reaches the value of ssX. An example is shown in Figure 13. X is decremented by 1 in each of the five steps and Y is incremented by 1 only in the second and fourth steps according to the result of comparison. Precisely identical steps are applied to the vector when dx tY, x being substituted for Y and Y for X in the above steps. This algorithm is an optimized one which generates nearest digitised dots to a vector. Thereafter, according to a preferred feature of the invention 2 bit mark has to be written into the corresponding position of the marked dot matrix. This can be achieved as follows A character will be scanned by the laser from left to right horizontally. Ignoring the node of two vectors, the 2 bit mark at each dot position of a vector is determined jointly by the quadrant in which the vector lies and by whether Y is varied in the respective steps as follows a for a vector occurring in first quadrant, if Y is varied in the present step in respect to the dot, then an E mark is written into the corresponding dot position of the marked dot matrix, if Y is not varied in the present step, then V mark is written, b for a vector occurring in second quadrant, if Y is varied in the last step in respect to the dot, then an E mark is written, if Y is not varied in the last step, then a V mark is written, c for a vector occurring in third quadrant, if Y is varied in the present step, then a B mark is written, if Y is not varied in the present step, then a V mark is written, and d for a vector occurring in fourth quadrant, if Y is varied in the last step, then a B mark is written, if Y is not varied in the last step, then a V mark is written, the term present step in respect to a dot meaning the step which begins with the dot and the term last step in respect to a dot meaning the step which ends at the dot. Further the 2 bit mark to be written into the node of two vectors is determined by the quadrants in which the first and second vectors lie and the variation of Y in the last and present step in respect to the node as follows EMI21.1 tb quadrant SEP in SEP quadrant SEP in SEP 2 bit SEP mark tb which SEP first SEP which SEP second SEP condition SEP to SEP be tb vector SEP lies SEP vector SEP lies SEP written tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP present SEP step SEP E mark tb SEP I SEP I SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP present SEP step SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP last SEP step SEP E mark tb SEP II SEP II SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP present SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP III SEP III SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP present SEP step SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP last SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP IV SEP IV SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP V mark tb SEP I SEP II SEP in SEP an SEP condition SEP E mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP resent SEP step SEP I mark tb SEP I SEP III SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP resent SEP step SEP E mark tb SEP I SEP IV SEP in SEP any SEP condition SEP V mark tb EMI22.1 tb quadrant SEP in SEP quadrant SEP in SEP 2 bit SEP mark tb which SEP first SEP which SEP second SEP condition SEP to SEP be tb vector SEP lies SEP vector SEP lies SEP written tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP both SEP the SEP last SEP and tb SEP II SEP I SEP present SEP steps SEP E mark tb SEP others SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP both SEP the SEP last SEP and tb SEP present SEP steps SEP I mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP both SEP the SEP last SEP and tb SEP II SEP III SEP present SEP steps SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP present SEP step tb SEP but SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP but tb SEP not SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP present SEP step SEP E mark tb EMI23.1 tb quadrant SEP in SEP quadrant SEP in SEP 2 bit SEP mark tb which SEP first SEP which SEP second SEP Condition SEP to SEP be tb vector SEP lies SEP vector SEP lies SEP written tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP II tb SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied tb SEP in SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in tb SEP III SEP I SEP the SEP present SEP step SEP I mark tb SEP Y SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied tb SEP in SEP the SEP Present SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP III SEP II SEP in SEP any SEP condition SEP SEP V mark tb SEP III SEP IV SEP in SEP any SEP condition SEP B mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP both tb SEP the SEP last SEP and SEP present tb SEP steps SEP I SEP I mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP both SEP the SEP last SEP and tb SEP IV SEP I SEP resent SEP steps SEP V mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP present SEP step SEP but tb SEP not SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP last SEP step SEP E mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP last SEP step SEP but SEP not tb SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP present SEP step SEP B mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP the tb SEP IV SEP II SEP last SEP step SEP I mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP not SEP varied SEP in tb SEP the SEP last SEP step SEP E mark tb SEP Y SEP is SEP varied SEP in SEP both tb SEP IV SEP III SEP the SEP last SEP and SEP present tb SEP steps SEP B mark tb SEP others SEP V mark tb The 2 bit mark may be written into the same position of the marked dot matrix more than once during the generation cf a character image because intersection of strokes is allowed.Then the final 2 bit mark of the marked dot matrix is determined jointly by the old mark previously written and by the mark to be written as follows old mark mark to be written final mark V V V V B B V E E V I I B V B B B B B E I B I B E V E E B I E E E E I E I V I I B B I E E I I I For example, the imitation Song typeface Chinese character as shown in Figure 14 consists of a horizontal regular stroke and a vertical regular stroke. Initially, the marked dot matrix is cleared, that is, a V mark is written into all positions. During the generation of the horizontal stroke, a B mark has been written into the dot position F andG. When the vertical stroke is being generated, a E mark is to be written into position G and a B mark is to be written into dot position F.Therefore the final 2 bit mark at a position must be determined jointly by the old mark already written and by the new mark to be written. In Figure 14, the final 2 bit mark at dot position G should be an I mark the final 2 bit mark at dot position F should still be a B mark, but an additional B mark must be written into the right side of dot position G i.e. dot position H , otherwise the number of B mark in this line would be less than that of E mark and an error would be caused. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment a check is made as to whether the number of B marks is equal to that of E marks in each line of the marked dot matrix and a warning signal generated if any inequality occurs. In other words, the final 2 bit mark at the node of two vectors can be generated by a 256x2 PROM or a 256x3 PROM wherein the address of the PROM consists of a old mark 2 bits , b quadrant in which the first vector lies 2 bits , c quadrant in which the second vector lies 2 bits d the bit indicating whether Y is varied in the present step 1 bit , e the bit indicating whether Y is varied in the last step 1 bit , and the contents of PROM consists of the corresponding 2 bit final mark and the bit indicating whether an additionalB mark or E mark should be written into the right side or left side of the dot in the case of 256x3 PROM. Dots of a vector other than the node can be regarded as a special case of the above where the two quadrants are the same. The marked dot matrix must now be transformed into a final dot matrix to, be outputted. Each line is scanned from left to right When aB mark is encountered, all the dots on the right of it will be set to 1 . I mark is always transformed into 1 , but it has no effect on other dots. An example of a marked dot matrix and its corresponding final dot matrix is shown in Figure 15. Sometimes a pair of B mark and E mark may be nested in another pair of B mark and E mark as shown in Figure 16 because of intersection of strokes. A 2 bit depth counter is included in the device to record the depth of the B mark when a B mark is encountered, the depth counter is incremented by 1 when an E mark is encountered, the depth counter is decremented by 1. The contents of the depth counter determine whether a V mark should be transformed into N l Two dots of the marked dot matrix can be transformed in a single cycle to increase speed. Two bits of the final dot matrix generated in a single cycle and the new state of the depth counter are the function of following 6 bits two corresponding dots of the marked dot matrix to be transformed 4 bits , old state of depth counter 2 bits . This can be implemented by a 64 x 4 PROM to increase speed and reduce cost. Examples of some values of the function are described in the following table two dots old state corresponding new state of marked of depth two bits of of depth dot matrix counter final dot matrix counter V B 0 01 1 V E 1 11 0 B V 0 11 1 E V 1 10 0 B B 0 11 2 E V 2 11 1 V I 0 01 0 B I 0 11 1 The compressed representation of characters described above provides a single basic size of character.It is therefore required to generate different sizes of character from that basic size. This can be achieved according to another feature of the invention during step a of the transformation procedure noted above in the manner described below. Because an irregular stroke is expressed as a vector series and the compressed representation of a regular stroke can also be reduced to a vector series, it is easy to augment or reduce a character to the required size by correspondingly scaling each vector in the vector series.But great efforts must be made to control quality precisely during scaling. Different scaling methods are preferably used for the following two situations a For the width of a regular stroke, width after scaling width before scaling x scale factor , here scale factor required size basic size, A represents the integral part of A b For any vector other than those corresponding to the width part of regular stroke, bx of the vector after scaling x coordinate at the end of the vector before scaling x scale factor x coordinate at the beginning of the vector before scaling x scale factor Ay of the vector after scaling y coordinate at the end of the vector before scaling x scale factor y coordinate at the beginning of the vector before scaling x scale factor here A represents the integral part of A. In essence, the method used in b is to scale each node first and then obtain Ax and ay of scaled vector by computing the difference between the coordinates of two respected scaled nodes the method used in a is to scale the length of vector directly. Method b requires more computation, but rounding off errors will not be accumulated during the scaling of a series of vectors. If method a were used to scale a series of vectors in irregular strokes, intolerable distortion would be incurred by the accumulation of rounding off errors, whereas if method b were used to scale the width part of regular strokes, the width of regular strokes after scaling could not be precisely controlled. For example, if two horizontal regular strokes of a 10.5 point Song typeface Chinese character have the same width of 2 units on a grid with 96 x 96 units and if the character size is to be decreased to 9 point with smaller dot matrix, the width of above two horizontal strokes might be different after scaling by method b one of them might become 1 unit and the other would remain 2 units because of their different Y positions on the grid. The result is intolerable and can be avoided by using method a to scale the width of three types of regular strokes. The scaling is performed during step a of the transformation procedure described above and can be achieved by using a PROM as follows for each principal character size, there is a PROM whose address is the coordinate before scaling and whose contents are the integral part of the product of the coordinate before scaling i.e. the address of the PROM and the scale factor for that character size, and for other character sizes, the scaling operation is done by first referencing the PROM for some principal character size and then performing addition and shift operations. For example, 12 point is a principal character size 36 point three times of 12 point is not a principal character size and there is no PROM for it but its scaling operation can be done by first referencing the PROM for 12 point, then shifting the result up one position, and then adding it to the value before shift Note 3 x A 2 x A A . According to statistics, regular strokes account for more than half of strokes in Chinese characters and precise control of their width during scaling has a great effect on output quality. Besides the above measure, two bits can be included in the 32 bit compressed representation for horizontal stroke of Song typeface characters described above to express precisely minor variation of width, which is less than one unit on a 96 x 96 grid. For example, width variation bits 10 denote the normal width of 2 units and 01 denote a width of 1.8 units on a 96 x 96 grid. Because 1.8 units cannot be precisely expressed on a 96 x 96 grid, both of them occupy 2 units on a 96 x 96 grid. However when a character size is decreased to 7.875 point, difference in width of above two horizontal strokes will be observed the former occupies 2 units and the latter occupies only 1 unit.2 bit width variation is very useful in securing quality during scaling for Chinese characters containing a large number of regular strokes. Figure 17 illustrates how characters can be scaled from a basic character size shown as the line 100. This line shows 8 characters in boldface type, and the portion marked 102 shows various stages of increased size. Characters which can be formed from the line 100 by equal enlargement in the X and Y directions whilst the portion marked 104 shows various stages of decreased size characters which can be formed from the line 100 by equal reductions in the X and Y directions. In the areas 106 and 108 font variants are shown which can be formed again from the basic size characters in the line 100 by greater change in the Y and X directions relative the X and Y directions, respectively. In all cases an excellent quality of reproduction is possible. According to a further aspect of the present invention a complex page layout for a laser typesetter with which output is made by a raster pattern, is generated from the dot matrix prepared. The arrangement used to prepare the dot matrix can be connected to a drum type laser typesetter with four laser beams in parallel. In order to guarantee very high output precision, the main mechanical parts of the laser typesetter move continuously and any pause of the raster output is not allowed during the output of a whole page. Therefore, the generation of complex page layout for a laser typesetter is much more difficult than the case of a CRT where page layout can be generated on the screen character by character and the generation can pause at any point. It would be time consuming and unacceptable to buffer the dots of an entire page layout about 108 bits onto disc store before output of that page. As a result, the generation of the dot matrix by the arrangement described above must always be faster than the raster output of the laser typesetter in any circumstances.Any delay in supplying data would result in error on the output film. In this further aspect of the invention, the above difficulties can be overcome by hardware software integrated design in which a new method of describing page layout and a new technique of generating characters section by section are used. The dot matrix producing device is connected to a general purpose computer, which is shared by a lot of terminal users and supports a dedicated time sharing operating system and a composition language compiler. Users may define the required page layouts by using various composition commands contained in the language, which are intermixed with the text to be composed and are interpreted by the compiler to produce the necessary page layout description information. A page is divided into rows and each row contains a variable number e.g. up to 64 of sections with each section consisting of a predefined fixed number e.g. 8, 16 or 32 of scan lines. During the output of a page by the laser typesetter, only two consecutive sections of the page layout are buffered into two alternative buffers RAM with one buffer being fetched by the laser typesetter for raster output and another buffer being filled by the device which generates dot matrices of characters. This means that the dot matrices of a series of characters in a row are generated and buffered not character by character but rather section by section.For example, if two alternative output buffers are named buffer A and buffer B and if there are M characters in a row, then the order of generation and buffering of dot matrices for the row is as follows The first section of the first character into appropriate location of buffer A, then the first section of the second character into appropriate location of buffer A, .............................................................then the first section of the Mth character into appropriate location of buffer A. When the first section of all M characters has been generated and buffered into buffer A, the device begins to generate the second section of these M characters and put into buffer B while buffer A is being fetched by the laser typesetter for raster output. The above operation is continued until all the sections of the current row are generated, buffered and output. The division of a page into rows and the division of each row into sections is made by software of the general purpose computer connected to the present device. Normally the rows correspond to natural lines and in most cases each row contains only a natural line of characters. The sole difference is that the number of scan lines contained in each row must be the multiple of the predefined fixed number of scan lines in a section. If, for example, the predefined fixed number is 8, then a row may contain, for example, 120, or 128 or 136 scan lines but 129 scan lines are not allowed.Such a division of page layout is especially beneficial to the simplification of the dot matrix producing device, which allows the use of only two small alternative output buffers to generate any complex page layout at high speed for raster output. If a scan line of the largest page on the film to be exposed by the laser consists of 8192 dots, then the capacity of the output buffer should be 8 x 8192 bits here 8 is the predefined fixed number of scan lines in each section . The information for precise description of page layout is produced by and can be fetched row by row from a general purpose computer and is specially designed to cater for the need of generating and buffering characters section by section. The description information for a row is temporarily stored in a local memory during generation of dot matrices and is arranged in the order of rows and can be composed of five types of 16 bit indicators which will be described in detail later. Some brief explanation is given here. The description information for each row begins with a 16 bit beginning of row indicator which marks the beginning of a row and indicates the number of sections it contains. A scan line counter is used to record how many sections have been processed. If the contents of this counter reach the value designated in the beginning of row indicator, it means that all the sections in the current row have been processed. Each character in the row must be accompanied by a X position indicator which defines its absolute X position on the page. Y position of the characters is defined by a Y position indicator, which can be shared by a series of characters.Instead of defining the absolute Y position on the page, it designates the relative Y position of the character or characters in the current row, that is, the difference in Y direction between the first line of the character and the first line of the current row. It should be noted that this value may be negative as well as positive. A negative value means that the character crosses two rows, that is, the upper part of the character lies in the above row, and the lower part is in the current row.This situation might occur in some complex page layout and cannot be avoided by careful division of the page because vertical arrangement of newspaper headlines is allowed and complex mathematical formula cannot be explicitly divided into separate rows without character crossing. The distinctive feature of Y position indicator makes it easier to generate and buffer characters section by section. The value defined in Y position indicator combined with the scan line counter is used to determine which section of the character is to be generated during each transformation. The scan line counter is cleared when a new row is encountered and is incremented by N when a section of all characters in the row has been processed here N is the predefined fixed number of scan lines contained in a section .Within a character, the beginning Y position of the current section to be generated is equal to the difference between the contents of the scan line counter and the relative Y position defined by the Y position indicator. An example is shown in Figure 18, where 120 scan lines are contained in the row and the relative Y position of the character defined by Y position indicator is 13. The predefined fixed number of scan lines in a section is assumed to be 8. During the processing of the first section of the row, the contents of the scan line counter are zero and thus the beginning Y position of the current section within the character, which is to be generated, is 13. This means that section 13, 6 of the character should be generated during the processing of the first section of the row. Because theY axis of a character grid begins with zero and directs downwards as shown in Figure 12, section 13, 6 is above the character and no dot matrix will be generated. But during the processing of the second section of the row, the scan line counter becomes 8 and section 5, 2 of the character should be generated, which means that the first three lines 0,1,2 of the character are to be generated, that is, any vector of the character lying or partly lying in the first three lines should be transformed into dot matrix here only vectors AB, CA . During the processing of the third section of the row, section 3, 10 of the character should be generated, and so on. A yet further feature of the invention relates to the technique of generating characters section by section at high speed. Before the transformation of each vector into a dot matrix, a test is made as to whether the vector or part of it is in the section currently being generated and buffered by, for example, comparing the Y positions of the start point and the end point of the vector with the Y position of the current section as follows if both the start point and the end point of the vector are above or below the current section, then the vector lies outside the current section and can be completely skipped, otherwise the vector or part of it is in the current section and must be transformed into dot matrix, but during transformation, whenever it is detected that the remaining part of the vector is outside the current section, the processing of the vector is terminated before reaching its end point and the next vector is tested and processed.Transformation into a dot matrix is performed only for those vectors which lie or partly lie in the current section. Steps b and c described above for transforming of the compressed representation into a dot matrix are time consuming because a large number of dots has to be dealt with, but steps a and b can be performed in parallel with step c by using two alternative buffers to store a section of marked dot matrix for each of two separate characters. Step c is performed only for a section of dot matrix and step b is performed only for those vectors which lie or partly lie in the current section. Step a must be performed for all the vectors of a character if the character is not entirely above or below the current section. But most vectors would be outside the current section and can be skipped. Although more computations are required by the method of generating characters section by section, it is easy to obtain a high generating speed by using bipolar IC and micro programming techniques.If the predefined fixed number of scan lines contained in a section is 8, a generating speed of 150 fullChinese characters per second can be reached easily if the predefined number becomes 32, then the generating speed could be increased to 300 characters per second. When the laser beam outputs are in parallel, multiple 2 bit depth counters can be used to facilitate the buffering of parallel dots generated from multiple lines of a marked dot matrix into the same location of the output buffer, as required by a laser typesetter with multiple outputs in parallel. A series of measures can be taken to increase generating speed. Some examples are given below. a During processing the first section of the row shown in Figure 18, the character is entirely below the current section and can be completely skipped without the test and processing of its strokes. During processing of the last section of the row shown in Figure 18, the character is entirely above the current section and can also be completely skipped. b During the processing of vector AB in Figure 19, when point C is reached, the remaining part of the vector, which is outside the current section, can be skipped and the device continues to test and process the next vector beginning with B. c All the regular strokes in Figure 20 can be completely skipped without the test and processing of each vector. Thus a test can be made on whether a regular stroke of a Chinese character is entirely above or below the current section by estimating the highest point and lowest point of the regular stroke, and if the estimated highest point is below the current section, or if the estimated lowest point is above the current section, the regular stroke is skipped. d All the starting feature, ending feature and turning feature of the regular strokes in Figure 21 can be skipped without the test and processing of their corresponding vector series. Thus, during the processing of regular strokes, tests can be made on a whether the ending feature of horizontal regular stroke is entirely above the current section, b whether the starting feature of vertical regular stroke is entirely above the current section, c whether the turning feature of turn regular stroke is entirely above the current section, and d whether the ending feature of vertical or turn regular stroke is entirely below the current section, and if the test result is true, the corresponding part of regular stroke can be skipped.For example, after vector AB of the vertical stroke in Figure 21 is processed, the device knows that point B is already above the current section and therefore the entire starting feature of the vertical stroke can be skipped by directly jumping to point C for the processing of vector CD. It is time consuming to process the starting, ending and turning features because they are composed of vector series. Complete skip might increase the speed considerably. Overwriting two or more fonts onto a single character position can be allowed to compose complex image where a Chinese character may have a pattern or vignette as its background and can be implemented by the following operations on the output buffer a whenever the data of the output buffer is fetched by the laser typesetter, it is cleared to zero, and b when the data of a section of final dot matrix for a character is to be written into the output buffer, it will be logically added to the original contents of the output buffer. All the above tests can be made by a microprogram at high speed and low cost. The selection of the required Chinese characters from disc store and transmission of these characters to the local memory of the device will now be described. Using the data compression technique described above, the storage required by 650,000 Chinese characters in different typefaces and sizes is reduced from 2 x 109 bytes bytes to 5 x 106 bytes. This is still large and all the characters have to be stored on removable discs to reduce hardware costs. Because the output speed of a laser typesetter is higher or much higher than the data supplying speed of a removable disc, especially in the worse case where the arm of the disc would have to move a long distance, and because any pause is not allowed during the raster output of the laser typesetter, access to removable disc cannot be permitted whenever the raster output begins.A local memory is therefore required and can be a small random access memory, which can store 4,000 to 5,000 different Chinese characters in compressed representation. Numerous typefaces and a very large number ofChinese characters are used in various publications. But for a specific book or a copy of newspaper on a specific day, the number of Chinese characters used is limited. For example, about 3,000 Chinese characters in two typefaces might be used for text and footnote of a book, and less than 300 Chinese characters in boldface and imitation Song typeface might be used for headlines of the book. Normally the total number of the characters occurring in a book would be less than 3,500 here different typefaces have been accounted . These characters can be selected from the disc store and transmitted to the local memory. During the output of the book, only the local memory is accessed by the character generator. This selection is made by the software of the general purpose computer connected to the present device after statistics determining which Chinese characters are used in the text to be outputted during reviewing of the text by the software. There is a main typeface in each book, that is the typeface for most part of the text. The number of main tAypefaze Chinese characters occurring in a book is usually much Jar ger than that of other typefaces of Chinese cha acters. In most publications, Song typeface is used as the main typeface. Sometimes imitation Song typeface or regular script typeface is also used as the main typeface. A user can denote the main typeface by a composition command.The most frequently used Chinese characters e.g. 3000, in the main typeface with the internal code numbers from 0 to 2999 may be always transmitted to the local memory from the disc store of the general purpose computer without any selection so as to reduce the amount of processing required by the statistics and selection. It should be noted that these 3,000 characters would account for over 80 of the characters occurring in a book and thus the processing time required by the statistics and selection for other characters is negligible as compared with the time of raster output. By way of example, Figure 22 shows a block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The most obvious advantage of the present device is good cost performance ratio. Generating speeds of about 300 characters per second can be easily obtained and higher speeds of about 80 commat characters per second are possible.Because no access to a disc is required during the raster output, the low access speed removable discs need no longer be the bottleneck of a Chinese character typesetting system.Cheap bipolar micro processor lends itself to the implementation of high speed Chinese character generator described above.
