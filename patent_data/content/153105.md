# Diffusion coated multiple units dosage form.

## Abstract
In an oral pharmaceutical controlled releasable multiple units formulation, individual units containing an active substance are coated with a substantially water insoluble, but water dif fusible controlled release coating which includes 1 an inner film layer which causes adhesion between the units at elevated temperatures, comprising a water dis persible film forming agent, and 2 an outer film layer comprising a water based film forming agent which prevents adhesion between the units at el evated temperatures and imparts flowability to the units. The inner film layer may additionally comprise a substance which is capable of forming a continuous phase. By subjecting the thus coated units to heating to acceler ate the formation of a continuous phase of the film forming agent of the inner layer and optionally also of the additional substance, a coating is formed which substantially does not change its diffusion characteristics in the course of time.
