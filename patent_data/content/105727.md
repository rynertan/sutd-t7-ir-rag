# HYDROCARBON SOLUBLE CATALYST SUPPORTS AND RESULTANT POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A method is provided for preparing hydrocarbon soluble magnesium siloxide supports comprising contacting such supports with sufficient aluminium alkoxide or organic ethers to render the supports hydrocarbon soluble. Thereaf ter the supports are contacted with a transition metal compound and halogenated to obtain polymerization catalysts.
