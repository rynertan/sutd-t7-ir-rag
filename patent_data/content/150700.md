# POLYPHOSPHAZENE FLUID SEPARATION MEMBRANES

## Abstract
Polyphosphazenes are disclosed as fluid separation membranes. Fluid separation membranes comprised of po lyphosphazenes having halogenated side groups are dis closed as exhibiting effective preferential selectivity and permeabilities for polar fluids relative to non polar fluids contained in feedstream mixtures. The polyphosphazenes are in general rubbery polymers having attractive fluids transport properties and improved thermal and chemical stability. Processes utilizing the phosphazene membranes for separating fluids from fluid mixtures are also disclosed.
