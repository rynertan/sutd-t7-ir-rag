# Skis.

## Abstract
A ski has at least two downwardly extending projections 10, 16, 16B , at least one on each side of the longitudinal axis of the ski, these being integral with the remainder of the ski or provided on one or more separate membes, for example on an inverted channel member 7 , the base 7A of the channel, on the upper side of the channel member 7 , lying above and being secured to the tail 1 of the ski, which extends between the side walls 7B of the channel member 7 . When the ski is placed on a flat horizontal surface, with the running face 3 of the ski lowermost, the tips 10A, 16A of the projections 10, 16, 16B , at the lowermost extremities of the projections, will be separated only by an air gap from said surface.
