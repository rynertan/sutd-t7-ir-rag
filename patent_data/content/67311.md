## Abstract
The present invention features a valve train for inducing reciprocative motion of a valve 28 which includes a lever 10 pivotally mounted at one end thereof, a rocker arm 18 which engages the lever to define a fulcrum point therebe tween, and which engages the valve 28 at one end thereof, a first cam 32 which engages the other end of the rocker arm 18 , a second cam 52 which engages the lever 10 , and a mechanism 14, 20 which guidingly interconnects the rocker arm 18 , a a point intermediate of the ends thereof, with the lever 10 for preventing relative slip therebetween and for ensuring that a cam following portion 30 of the rocker arm 18 smoothly follows the first cam 32 .
