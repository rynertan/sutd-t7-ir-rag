# Electronic tuning antenna system.

## Abstract
At the feed side 22, 22 of each antenna element 15, 15 comprising transmitting conductor ways formed in turnback shape in continuation and having distributed constant impedance are electrically connected variable tuning units 16, 18 including an impedance adjusting element 23 and voltage variable capacitors 17, 17 . Antenna feed terminals 22, 22 are connected through a coaxial cable to input terminals at a remoteset radio receiver. A tuning control signal generated within the radio receiver is fed to the voltage variable capacitors 17, 17 at the antenna circuit through the coaxial cable. The tuning control signal allows the antenna circuit to resonate at a particular frequency within a frequency band, the frequency being variable in response to the control signal. The antenna element, having distributed constant inductance, functions to have the best antenna radiation efficiency at the resonant frequency by means of the variable tuning unit and is considerably smaller than a conventional dipole. At the resonant frequency, the characteristic impedance at the feed terminals to the antenna circuit becomes equal to that at the receiving input terminals connected to the antenna circuit, so as to increase efficiency of transfer of the signal from the antenna to the radio receiver.
