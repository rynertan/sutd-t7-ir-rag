# Glass melter.

## Abstract
The glass melter 10 has an outlet member 44 formed as a heating device for controlling the outlet flow rate of molten glass 18 from the melter 10 . Raw batch material 16 that is used to form the molten glass 18 is heated to a molten state at a first temperature range. The molten glass 18 , while flowing toward the outlet 44 of the melter 10 is cooled to a second temperature range to increase the viscosity of the molten glass to a desired level. The outlet member 44 then heats the exiting viscosity in accordance with desired flow rate requirements. Heating of the outlet member 44 is accomplished by imposing a relatively low voltage and a relatively high amperage on the outlet member 44 . Accordingly, by using the outlet member 44 as a heating a controlled flow rate of molten glass from the melter 10 is achieved.
