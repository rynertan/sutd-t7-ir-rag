# Composition of matter comprising a magnesium compound reacted with a fluoropolymer, method for producing the same and use of the same for preparing a modified asbestos diaphragm for a chlor alkali cell.

## Abstract
Magnesium compounds, such as magnesium oxide or hydroxide, at least partially reacted with fluoropolymer con taining carboxyl ions, carboxylic acid or carbonyl fluoride functional groups provide compositions which are useful as modifiers for asbestos diaphragms for chlor alkali cells to reduce the voltage and increase the efficiency of such cells.
