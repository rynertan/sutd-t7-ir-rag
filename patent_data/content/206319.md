# DATA ENCODING DECODING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
In a data encoding decoding circuit, a data encoding circuir 100 includes a first clock 111 , a first time setting circuit 112 , a first random number generator 113 , and a converter 114 for receiving transmission data and convert ing the transmission data into output data with frame sync signals. A data decoding circuit 200 includes a second clock 211 , a second time setting circuit 212 , a frame sync extracting circuit 216 , a time correction circuit 213 for correcting the time of the second clock, a second random number generator 214 , and an inverter 215 for inverting output data from the frame sync extracting circuit with a ran dom number from the second random number generator and outputting the inverted data as decoded data.
