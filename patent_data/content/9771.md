# Ignition timing control system for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An ignition timing control system for an internal combustion engine comprising a circuit A for generating a reference ignition signal in synchronism with the engine, a circuit B for generating a retard ignition signal at a point shifted by a selected shaft angle of the engine from the reference ignition signal, and an ignition circuit 3 for controlling the ignition timing of the engine according to the retard ignition signal said retard ignition signal generator B includes a capacitor circuit Q for charging and discharging, a first constant current circuit T₁₉, T₂₀ for always supplying a first current I₂ to the capacitor circuit Q , a second constant current circuit T₁₇, T₁₈ for supplying a second current I₁ larger than the first current I₂ to said capacitor circuit 0 , a switching circuit 11 which starts flowing the second current I₁ in synchronism with the reference ignition signal and cuts off the second current I₁ when the terminal voltage across said capacitor circuit Q reaches a reference level, and an output circuit 10 for generating a retard ignition signal in synchronism with the cutting off operation of said switching circuit 11 .
