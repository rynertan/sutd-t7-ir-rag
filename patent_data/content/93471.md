# SWITCHED DELAY CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A delay circuit is provided having a low pass filter 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34 and a subtracting circuit 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37 which are both integrable on a single semiconductor chip. The subtracting circuit provides an output signal proportional to the difference in magnitude of the delay circuit input signal and a differentiated output signal iâ‚‚ of the low pass filter such that the output signal is a phase delayed version of the input signal. The phase delay provided by the delay circuit is enabled and disabled by a control signal present at a control input 42 to the delay circuit.
