# Filler means for charging containers.

## Abstract
A filler valve assembly including a fluid pressure acti vated upper control valve, a spring for urging the control valve closed, a fixed lower flow control valve, a nozzle slidably mounted in the lower end of the valve body, a second spring for normally urging the nozzle into a capillary seal relationship with the lower flow control valve, and spacer means extending between the nozzle and the upper control valve. Upon receiving a measured volume of fluid under pressure from an external source, the upper control valve is opened, causing the nozzle to move relative to the fixed lower flow control valve and thereby discharge a measured volume of fluid product into a container there below.
