Although preparation of certain compounds of the invention have been illustrated in some detail by the foregoing, it is to be understood that other compounds of the invention may be readily prepared by those skilled in the art using the same or similar techniques and by varying the choice of starting materials. Weed control in accordance with this invention is effected by application, either before or after emergence of weeds, of a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of this invention. It is, of course, to be understood that the term a compound of this invention also includes mixtures of such compounds. The term herbicidally effective amount is that amount of a compound of this invention required to so injure or damage weeds such that the weeds are incapable of recovering following application. The quantity of a compound of this invention applied in order to exhibit a satisfactory herbicidal effect may vary over a wide range and depends on a variety of factors, such as, for example, hardiness of a particular weed species, extent of weed infestation, climatic conditions, soil conditions, method of application, and the like. Typically, as little as one or less pound per acre of a compound of this invention would be expected to provide satisfactory weed control, although in some instances application rates in excess of one pound per acre e.g., up to 5 or more pounds per acre might be required. Of course, the efficacy of a particular compound against a particular weed species may readily be determined by routine laboratory or field testing in a manner well known to the art. It is expected that satisfactory weed control can be had at a rate of application in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 pound per acre. Of course, a compound of this invention can be formulated according to routine methods with any of several known and commonly used herbicidal diluents, adjuvants and carriers. The formulations can contain liquid carriers and adjuvants such as organic solvents, as well as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dispersants, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants, wetting agents and the like. Typical carriers utilized in dry formulations include clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, silica and the like. Preferred formulations are those in the form of wettable powders, flowables, dispersible granulates or aqueous emulsifiable concentrates which can be diluted with water at the site of application. Also, dry formulations such as granules, dusts, and the like, may be used. Shen desired, a compound of this invention can be applied in combination w ith other herbicidal agents in an effort to achieve even broader vegetative control. Typical herbicides which can be conveniently combined with Formula I compound include atrazine, hexazinone, metribuzin, ametryn, cyanazine, cyprazine, prometon, prometryn, propazine, simazine, terbutryn, props. , alachlor, acifluorfen, bentazon, metolachlor and N,N dialkyl thiocarbates such as EPIC, butylate or vernolate. These, as well as other herbicides described, for example, in the Herbicide Handbook of the WeedScience Society of America, may be used in combination with a compound or compounds of the invention.Typically such formulations will contain from about 5 to about 95 percent by weight of a compound of this invention. The herbicidal formulations contemplated herein can be applied by any of several methods known to the art. Generally, the formulation will be surface applied as an aqueous spray. Such application can be carried out by conventional ground equipment, of if desired, the sprays can be aerially applied. Soil incorporation of such surface applied herbicides is accorpllshed by natural leaching, and is of course facilitated by natural rainfall and melting snow. If desired, however, the herbicides can be incorporated into the soil by conventional tillage means. The compounds prepared as described in the Examples were individually screened for herbicidal efficacy, against a variety of broadleaf and grassy weed species, under controlled laboratory conditions of light, humidity and temperature. Solvent solutions of said compounds were applied, both presscergence and postemergence, to test flats containing the various weed species, and herbicidal efficacy was determined by periodic visual inspection, after application of the compounds. Herbicidal efficacy was determined on a scale of from 0 no injury to 10 all plants dead . Basis, these screening tests, of this invention are believed effective for preemergence or postemergence control of a wide variety of broadleaf and grassy weeds. Typical of the various species of vegetative growth that may be controlled, combated, or eliminated are, for example, annuals such as pigweed, lambsquarters, foxtail, crabgrass, wild mustard, field pennycress, ryegrass, goose grass, chickweed, wild oats, velvetleaf, purslane, barnyardgrass, smartweed, knotweed, cocklebur, kochia, medic, ragweed, beip nettle, spurrey, pondweed, carpetweed, morningglory, ducksalad, cheatgrass, fall panicum, jimsonweed, witchgrass, watergrass, wild turnip, and similar annual grasses and weeds. Biennials that may be controlled include wild barley, campion, burdock, bull thistle, roundleaved allov, purple star thistle, and the like. Also controlled by the compounds of this invention are perennials such as quackgrass, Johnsongrass, Canada thistle, curly dock, field chickweed, dandelion, Russian knapweed aster, horsetail ironweed, sesbania, cattail, wintercress, horsenettle, nutsedge, niled, sicklepod, and the like. Although the invention has been described in considerable detail by the foregoing, it is to be understood that many variations may be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of thereof, as defined by the appended claims.
