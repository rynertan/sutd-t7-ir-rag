# CONTAINER FOR PRESSURISED LIQUID

## Abstract
A flexible bag 10 adapted for reception of a pressurised liquid, e.g. a carbonated beverage, and having a tap 15 whereby the liquid may be dispensed is enclosed within a cylin drical casing 11 at each end of which is a respective end cap 12, 13 . To minimise head space in the bag 10 as the liquid is dispensed so that the liquid does not go flat or stale, one end cap 13 is movable inwardly of the casing 11 . This is prefer ably achieved by pushing downwards on the end cap 13 .
