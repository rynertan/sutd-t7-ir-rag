# Step motor driving circuit.

## Abstract
A step motor driving circuit, wherein the motor has two pairs of magnetically coupled windings 1, 2 and 3, 4 includes switching transistors 9, 10, 11, 12 associated to the windings, diodes 15, 16, 17, 18 in parallel to the switching transistors for the recycle of the current induced during the possible current chopping and the phase switching, and a diode 6 8 and a capacitor 5 7 , in parallel each other and series connected between the voltage source, and each pair of magnetically coupled windings. As soon as a phase is deenergized, the driving circuit allows to recover the energy stored in such phase by charging the capacitor coupled to it. From such capacitor the energy is then returned to the phase magnetically coupled to the previous one in case of phase switching or to the same phase in case of current chopping. The driving circuit speeds up the phase switching and therefore increases the torque delivered by the motor at high frequencies.
