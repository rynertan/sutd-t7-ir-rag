# A device for spreading granular and or powdery material.

## Abstract
Distribution members 3, 4 of a spreading device are disposed close to each other. The distance 67 between the points of closest approach of the distribution members 3, 4 may be 2 centimetres. The outside diameter of each distribution member may be 35 centimetres. Flow of material to a distribution member 4 of a spreading device is controlled by delivery means 86 . The delivery means 86 comprises dosing plates 82, 83, 84, 85 which are indepen dently displaceable relatively to each other and to the bottom 81 of a hopper of the device. The dosing plates 82, 83, 84, 85 and the bottom 81 have openings which cooperate with one another in an adjustable manner which makes it possible to adjust the position of the delivery of material to the distribution member 4 both in radial and circumferential directions, and to adjust the size of the or each delivery orifice.
