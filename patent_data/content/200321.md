# TRANSCUTANEOUS POWER AND SIGNAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR INCREASED SIGNAL TRANSMISSION EFFICIENCY

## Abstract
A transcutaneous signal transmission system having coupling coil alignment tolerance and increased coupling efficiency includes an external transmitter and first tuned circuit including a first coupling coil and an implantable receiver and second tuned circuit including a second cou pling coil. The first and second tuned circuits are stagger tuned whereby closer spacing of the coupling coils is permitted in achieving optimum coupling.
