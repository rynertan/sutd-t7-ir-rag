# Preparation of soluble molybdenum Catalysts for epoxidation of olefins.

## Abstract
Production of molybdenum containing stable catalyst solutions especially adapted for use in the epoxidation of olefinic compounds with an organic hydroperoxide by reaction of molybdenum metal with a peroxy compound and an organic dicarboxylic acid in the presence of monohydroxy alcohol.
