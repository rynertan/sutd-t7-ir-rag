# PAD FOR ABSORBTION OF BODY ODOUR

## Abstract
This invention relates to the absorbtion of body odour and is concerned with a provision of a pad which can be incorporated into a garment e.g. at the armhole scye, to absorb odour. The pad comprises a layer of charcoal felt sandwiched between two layers of cotton gauze which are cut to shape and size so as to fit into the base of an armhole scye of a jacket, dress, blouse or other garment. The pad consists of two layers 10 and 11 of cotton gauze between which is sandwiched a layer of charcoal felt. The charcoal felt may be made in accordance with the process claimed in UK patent 1 310 011, the fibrous carbon used for the carbon felt being derived for example from an organic polymer fibre such as a carbohydrate fibre.
