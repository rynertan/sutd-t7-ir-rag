# Process for the preservation of color and flavor in liquid containing comestibles.

## Abstract
The susceptibility to color and flavor loss of liquid containing comestibles due to oxidative deterioration during storage is reduced by placing the comestible in the cathode compartment of an electrochemical cell in which the com partments of the cell containing the anode and cathode are separated by a cation permeable membrane and the anode compartment contains a highly dissociatable, non oxidizable inorganic acid electrolyte, and thereafter subjecting the comestible to a high density current for a short period of time sufficient to generate hydrogen at the cathode to remove oxygen from the comestible but insufficient to effect a substantial chemical change in the comestible. The deoxi dized comestible is then stored in a hermetically sealed container in which air is substantially absent.
