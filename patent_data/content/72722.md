# A method for preparing ganglioside derivatives and use thereof in pharmaceutical compositions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for preparing inner ester ganglioside derivates which comprises a dissolving a ganglioside or a mixture of ganglio sides obtained from a mammal in a non aqueous organic solvent b converting the carboxylate groups in the ganglio sides to carboxyl groups or a salt thereof by means of ion exchange and c reacting the resultant ganglioside or mixture of gangliosides with a lactonization reagent to form at least one lactonic bond in said inner ester ganglioside derivatives.
