## Description
CRYSTALLINE SILICATES AND PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to crystalline silicates and a process for the production thereof. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with crystalline silicates having a novel structure, which can be used as catalysts for various chemical reactions with satisfactory results, and a process for efficiently producing the crystalline silicates. A number of crystalline silicates, natural or synthetic, have heretofore been known, and a wide variety of methods for producing crystalline silicates have been proposed. These methods are usually carried out in aqueous solutions. Recently, however, there have been developed methods in which the reaction is performed in aqueous solutions with alcohols added thereto see U.S. Patent 4,199,556 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 43800 77 .Crystalline silicates produced by the conventional methods have the known crystal structures, e.g., ZSM 5 and Zeta 3.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As a result of extensive investigations to develop crystalline silicate having novel compositions and crystal structures, it has been found that the addition of a large amount of methanol to starting materials leads to the production of crystalline silicate having a crystal structure which is different from the known ones, e.g., ZSM 5 and Zeta 3. The present invention provides 1 a crystalline silicate named as ISI 1 having a composition represented by the general formula I as described hereinafter and main X ray diffraction data as shown in Table 1 both being determined after calcining in air at 5500C and 2 a process for producing a crystalline silicate having a composition represented by the general formula I as described hereinafter and main X ray diffraction data as shown in Table 1 both being determined after calcining in air at 5500C which comprises reacting an aqueous mixture containing a a silica source, b an alumina source, c an alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal source, and d methanol in the following molar ratios silica alumina 10 1 methanol water 0.1 1 to 10 1 methanol silica 5 1 to 100 1 hydroxyl group silica 0.01 1 to 0.5 1 alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal silica 0.1 1 to 3 1 hydroxyl group alumina 1 100 1 at a temperature of from 100 to 3000C until the desired crystalline silicate is formed.

In Figs 1 and 2, ç means the angle of the incidence.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the process of the invention, a a silica source, b an alumina source, c an alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal source, and d methanol are added to water to prepare an aqueous mixture, and the thusprepared aqueous mixture is reacted. The silica source a as used herein is not critical, and silica powder, silicid acid, colloidal silica, dissolved silica, and the like can be used. As the dissolved silica, for example, water glass silicic acid salts and alkaline earth metal silicic acid salts, each containing from 1 to 5 moles of SiO2 per mole of Na2O or K2O, can be used. As the alumina source b , various compounds can be used, including aluminum sulfate, sodium aluminate, colloidal alumina, and alumina. Although the ratio of silica to alumina in the aqueous mixture can be determined appropriately, it is preferred that the molar ratio of silica SiO2 to alumina A1203 is at least 10 1, the optimum molar ratio being from 40 1 to 1,000 1. As the alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal source c , various compounds can be used Compounds which can be used as the alkali metal source include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In addition, sodium silicate and sodium aluminate can be used, which serve also as a silica or alumina source. A particularly preferred alkali metal is sodium. Compounds which can be used as the alkaline earth metal source include calcium nitrate and calcium chloride. The molar ratio of alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal to silica should be determined within the range of from 0.1 1 to 3 1, with the range of from 0.2 1 to 1 1 being particularly preferred. Methanol d plays an important role in forming the crystal structure of the present crystalline silicate although it does not remain therein as a constitutive component. It is preferred to use a relatively large amount of methanol. Thus, the molar ratio of methanol to water should be determined within the range of from 0.1 1 to 10 1, with the range of from 0.2 1 to 5 1 being particularly preferred, and the molar ratio of methanol to silica should be determined within the range of from 1 1 to 100 1, with the range of from 3 1 to 60 1 being particularly preferred. The above described components a , b , c and d are added to water topreparean aqueous mixture, and then reacted. In the reaction system, the molar ratio of hydroxyl groups in the aqueous mixture to silica hydroxyl group silica should be controlled within the range of from 0.01 1 to 0.5 1. Furthermore,.the molar ratio of hydroxyl groups to alumina hydroxyl group alumina should be controlled within the range of 100 1 or more. The aqueous mixture is reacted by heating under the conditions, e.g., temperature and time, that are required for the formation of the desired crystalline silicate.In more detail, it is sufficient to heat the aqueous mixture at a temperature of from 100 to 3000C, preferably 120 to 2000C for a period of from 5 hours to 10 days, preferably from 10 hours to 5 days. The pressure under which the reaction is performed is not critical, and it is usually carried out under autogenous pressure. Moreover, the reaction is usually carried out while stirring, and if necessary, may be performed in an inert gas atmosphere. It is required for the crystallization reaction to be performed always in the presence of methanol. Unless this requirement is satisfied, the desired crystalline silicate cannot be produced. After the crystallization reaction, the reaction products are washed with water and dried at a temperature of about 1200C. Thus, there is produced the desired crystalline silicate having the composition represented by the general formula I and main X ray diffraction pattern shown in Table 1 both being determined after calcining in air at 5500C . The relative intensities of lattice spacings d other than the main lattice spacings shown in Table 1 are not critical in the invention. In particular, however, those crystalline silicates having an X ray diffraction pattern as shown in Table 2 are preferred.

For example, the crystalline silicate ISI 1 can be used as a catalyst which enables to produce paraxylene through the methylation of toluene by a simplified procedure and furthermore, at a high selectivity over a long period of time. In addition, it can be used as an effective catalyst for efficiently producing an aromatic com ponent rich gasoline fraction from those hydrocarbons having a low aromatic component content. In the production of paraxylene by the methylation of toluene, methanol, dimethyl ether, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, and the like can be used as a methylating agent. Of these compounds, methanol is preferred. This methylating agent and toluene are reacted in the presence of the crystalline silicate catalyst, usually under the conditions pressure, from atmospheric pressure to 100 kilograms per square centimeter gauge kg cm2G , preferably from atmospheric pressure to 50 kilograms per square centimeter gauge temperature, from 300 to 8000C, preferably 300 to 5000C and liquid hour space velocity LH , from 0.5 to 5 per hour hr1 , preferably 1 to 2.5 per hour.The molar ratio of toluene to the methylating agent is from 0.5 1 to 10 1 and preferably from 2.1 to 5 1. The crystalline silicate ISI 1 of the invention can also be used in the production of an aromatic com ponentwrich gasoline fraction from a hydrocarbon feed having a low aromatic component content. The aromatic component content of the hydrocarbon feed is not critical, and various hydrocarbons having varied aromatic component contents can be used. Usually a hydrocarbon feed having an aromatic component content of 15 by weight or less is used. Typical examples are a gaseous hydrocarbon fraction containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, a liquid hydrocarbon fraction, e.g., naphtha, and a mixture thereof. This reaction is usually performed under the conditions pressure, atmospheric pressure to 50 kilograms per square centimeter gauge, preferably atmospheric pressure to 20 kilograms per square centimeter gauge temperature, 200 to 5500C, preferably 350 to 4500C and weight hour space velocity WHSV , 0.1 to 50 per hour, preferably 0.5 to 10 per hour. Accordingly, the crystalline silicate IS1 of the invention can be used widely in the general chemical industry, particularly in petroleum refinery. The present invention is explained in greater detail by reference to the following examples.EXAMPLE 1 The following solutions were prepared.
