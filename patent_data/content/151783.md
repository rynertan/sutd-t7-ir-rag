## Description
This invention relates to bacterial lysis methods, and more particularly to diagnostic assays including such lysis methods for the exposure or release of bacterial antigen contained in the bacteria prior to performing an assay for the antigen. Organisms classified as gram positive bacteria, for example, It has been discovered that the enzyme achromopeptidase can be used to effectively and inexpensively expose or release antigens specific for various strains of intact organisms, such as the group A carbohydrate of Group A Strep organisms. When such exposure is carried out as part of an assay for detecting the antigen, the necessity for culturing cells is eliminated and the assay can be performed more rapidly and inexpensively by comparison with conventional assays which do not utilize this enzyme. The present invention is based upon this discovery and involves an improvement in an assay for determining a bacterial antigen in a test sample comprising antigen containing bacterial cells. The improvement comprises exposing bacterial antigen in the cells by contacting them with achromopeptidase prior to performing the assay. The improvement provides a rapid, single and less expensive method for exposing the antigen by comparison with known techniques. An enzyme preparation called achromopeptidase TBL 1 , prepared from the organism An experiment was conducted to test the bacteriolytic capabilities of Achromopeptidase in the presence of Group A strep. Group A strep Type T 12 was resuspended in 0.01 Molar M Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 0.01M NaCl at a concentration of 1 X 10⁸ bacteria milliliter ml . Achromopeptidase WAKO, No. LTR 9868 was initially added to 2 ml aliquots of this bacterial solution final concentration of enzyme was 500 units ml . The aliquots were incubated for various lengths of time at 37 C. and the decrease in optical density at 630 nanometers nm at each time was monitored. After 15 minutes a drop in optical density OD of 75 was observed, indicating lysis of cells. After 60 minutes, complete clearing was noted. In addition, exposure and or release of antigen into the supernatant was shown by the ability of rabbit anti Group A strep antiserum to precipitate antigen in a subsequent capillary precipitin test. The nature of the antigen exposed to the supernatant was further studied by the following experiments. First, approximately 200 grams g of Group A strep, Type T12, was resuspended in 1 liter of 0.01M Tris HCl with 0.01M NaCl, pH 8. To this suspension, 0.67 g achromopeptidase 1000 units mg was added and The mixture stirred at 37 C. for three days. The cell walls were then centrifuged down and the supernatant concentrated and dialyzed utilizing an Amicon filter YM 10 . Five milliliters of the concentrated supernatant were diluted 1 2 in Tris buffer .05M and placed on a 75 ml DEAF column equilibrated in the Tris buffer, pH 8. The column was washed with buffer and a linear salt gradient to 1M NaCl in buffer was applied. Two ml fractions were collected and the OD was monitored at 280 nm. All fractions were tested for their ability to react with antiserum to Group A strep. Two main antigen peaks were eluted from the DEAF column the first peak was neutral or basic at pH 8, eluting in the wash, and the second peak was weakly acidic, eluting shortly after the application of the linear gradient. Both peaks contained rhamnose as analyzed by the methylpentose assay as well as some protein as assessed by the Lowry protein assay. Immunoelectrophoresis of these fractions confirmed their antigenicity and charge. Next, the achromopeptidase preparation containing both neutral and acidic antigen was fractionated on a G 100 Sephadex column to determine the molecular weight of the antigens. One ml of sample was placed on a column with a bed volume of 115 ml. The column was equilibrated in 0.1M ammonium carbonate buffer pH 7.3 and the sample was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 12 ml h. Two ml fractions were then collected and tested for the presence of antigen. The OD of the eluent was also monitored at 280 nm. Only one broad molecular weight of antigens was observed estimated to be approximately 36,000 daltons eluting near the center of the peak. Thus, it appears that the antigens exposed by achromopeptidase from Group A strep consist primarily of two charged species neutral or basic at pH 8 and acidic with molecular weights close to 36,000. It was of interest to determine if the antigens exposed by treatment with achromopeptidase were indeed antigenically related to the carbohydrate which defines strep as Group A. Therefore, the achromopeptidase preparations were compared to Group A polysaccharide APS prepared by the following procedures HCl extraction, according to the Rantz Randall method, treatment with mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus and nitrous acid extraction. An Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis was carried out on these preparations by placing appropriate samples of each in outer wells of an agarose slide and placing antistrep Group A antiserum in the center well. The results of the double diffusion analysis indicate that there is antigenic identity between the single lines of the HCl and nitrous acid extracts. These lines appeared to fuse with two lines associated with the mutanolysin and achromopeptidase extracts. However, slight spurring indicating partial identity appeared between the inner line of diluted achromopeptidase preparation and the nitrous acid preparation. Since identical spurring did not occur between the achromopeptidase preparation and any other preparation, it is difficult to interpret this result. Double diffusion analysis of the two antigens eluted from the DEAE column indicated antigenic identity with HCl Extracted APS. Therefore, it can be stated that achromopeptidase does release the group antigen of Finally, the use of achromopeptidase TBL 1 in accordance with the invention to expose antigen in assays designed to detect and diagnose Group A strep was demonstrated. A commercial immunoassay kit containing latex coated with specific antibody to Group A strep Streptex , Burroughs Wellcome was utilized. Strep Group A grown on blood agar plates was placed in either extracting enzyme It will thus be apparent to those skilled in the art that achromopeptidase can be advantageously used in many different types of assays known in the art which are designed for the diagnosis of Strep Group A and other antigens, for example, agglutination assays, hemagglutination assays or enzyme linked immunoassays. It is to be appreciated that this enzyme can therefore be used to expose or release antigens which are specfic for various strains of bacteria, yeasts and other organisms, providing a rapid means for identifying such organisms in various noncultural types of assays. The amount of achromopeptidase used in the invention to expose bacterial antigen is not critical, and can vary widely, depending upon the type of bacteria and amount thereof in the test sample. In the usual case, upon contact with small amounts of achromopeptidase, bacterial cells in a test sample have been found to rapidly release their bacterial antigens together with other cell contents into the test sample. Furthermore, achromopeptidase used in accordance with the present invention has been shown to be capable of effective use in exposing or releasing antigen found in bacterial cells at a wide range of pH values, from slightly acidic to basic. However, it is preferred that it be used in a pH range of from 8 to 9.5. It has been found that the use of surfactants, solvents, buffers and other agents in combination with lytic agents , conventionally used in typical lytic techniques which are carried out prior to performance of conventional assays to release cell contents, are totally unnecessary in the practice of the present invention. Accordingly, this invention not only eliminates cell culturing, but also provides a means of exposing antigen contained within bacterial cells more simply, easily, rapidly and inexpensively than known techniques so that the antigen can be efficiently detected by conventional assays. Various modifications of this invention as specifically described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
