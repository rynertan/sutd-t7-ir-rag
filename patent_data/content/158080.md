# Adjustable delivery cigarette.

## Abstract
An adjustable delivery cigarette and method for produ cing same, whose strength delivery may be altered by the consumer in a range between higher and lower values. The cigarette includes a tobacco rod 12 , with paper wrapper 14 , and the filter assembly 16 . An over wrap 18 encircles the filter element 16 and may also join the filter element to the tobacco rod. The overwrap has an adjustment zone 22 formed therein, which may be in the form of a circumferential slot. The circumferential slot may extend partially through the overwrap, or may extend completely through the over wrap and partially through the filter plugwrap 20 . In the latter instance, the filter plugwrap should be relatively im pervious to airflow. Application by the consumer of a bending moment to the filter assembly results in the adjustment zone being ruptured, allowing a greater degree of air dilution, re sulting in a decreased perceptible strength to the consumer. This adjustable delivery cigarette can be manufactured con veniently using laser apparatus known to the art, modified and adjusted to achieve the desired levels of penetration.
