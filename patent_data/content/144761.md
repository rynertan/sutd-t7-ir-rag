# ULTRASONIC SENSOR

## Abstract
A single transducer ultrasonic distance sensor is dis closed which provides for range sensing down to zero distance fron an envelope 24 of a sensor housing 11 with an electro acoustic transducer 17 subject to unavoidable ringing following emission of a burst of acoustic energy. The housing 11 is configured and the transducer mounted therein so that an acoustic path at leapt half as great as the distance travelled by an acoustic signel during the transduc er ringing interval is provided within the housing envelope.
