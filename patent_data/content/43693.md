# Sprayer for molasses or the like.

## Abstract
A sprayer for molasses or similar viscous liquid is pro vided in which a heated gaseous medium such as steam under pressure is directed past an outlet member or cup 2 for mix ing with molasses discharging from the cup in order to effec tively break up the discharging molasses into a finely divided spray. A further gaseous medium such as air under pressure is preferably also directed past the cup 2 for also breaking up the discharging molasses, the air and steam being directed from respective annular openings or clearances 30, 40 about the cup 2 . The air outlet opening 30 is shown immediately about the cup 2 so as to enable coolant air flow to take place between the cup 2 and adjacent steam flow to the annular opening 40 . Inlet means 61, 63 is shown to the cup 2 for the periodic admission of steam under pressure into the cup for purging it of molasses tending to adhere within it due to caramelisation of the molasses.

## Description
This invention relates to sprayers for spraying molasses or similar viscous liquids and method of operation thereof, e.g. for spraying molasses in finely divided form into cattle or other animal food or for spraying animal fats and acid oils.The invention is concerned with such sprayers in which the molasses or the like discharges from an outlet member or cup into a stream of a gaseous medium, e.g. air flowing past the outlet member or cup whereby the discharging molasses or other viscous liquid is broken up into finely divided form.A sprayer of this general kind is set forth in the specification of our prior patent No. 1,315,157 in which air under pressure is directed past a rotatable tnrower cup to break up molasses or the like discharging therefrom.The object of this invention is to provide a sprayer of the abovementioned general kind having an improved spraying action for enabling an improved method of spraying to be carried out and which may be of simplified construction. Practical advantages in these and other respects will be apparent from the following disclosure. According to this invention a sprayer for molasses or a similar viscous liquid is characterised by the sprayer having means for directing a heated gaseous medium such as steam under pressure past an outlet member or discharge cup of the sprayer, i.e. in the direction of molasses or similar liquid discharging therefrom in order to mix with and break up the discharging molasses or the like into a finely divided spray beyond the outlet member or discharge cup.Further in accordance with the invention the method of spraying molasses or a similar viscous liquid is characterised by directing a heated gaseous medium such as steam under pressure past an outlet member or discharge cup of a sprayer in order to mix with and break up the molasses or the like discharging from the outlet member or cup into a finely divided spray beyond the outlet member or discharge cup. In practice the construction and arrangement of the sprayer is as follows, reference being had to the accompanying drawing which is an axial plane section of the sprayer.For spraying molasses, the sprayer is shown intended for use in a vertical position in order to direct the spray of molasses in a downward direction, e.g. into cattle food.The sprayer comprises an outer casing1 containing a discharge cup 2 about a vertical axis, the interior wall 22 of the cup 2 being of taper or conical form diverging to the lower mouth 20 of the cup. The cup 2 may be rotatable about its axis but is preferably non rotatable as shown for simplified construction of the sprayer.The casing 1 contains at its lower part an annular nozzle 3 shown of conical form in an opposite manner to the cup 2 and concentrically surrounding the lower end of the latter with clearance at 30, a further concentric member or ring 4 of conical form being provided with clearance 40 about the conical nozzle 3 and shown carried by a base plate 5 on which the casing 1 is mounted.In use molasses is introduced axially into the upper end of the cup 2 from a supply pump not shown via an axial passageway 60 in a support member 6 carrying the cup 2. The upper interior of the cup 2 contains a ported deflector 62 for directing the molasses against the interior conical wall 22 of the cup 2 whereby the molasses flows downwardly in a divergent direction and discharges in a similar manner from the mouth 20 of the cup 2. The support member 6 is shown mounted from the top of the casing 1 by a hollow bolt 66.Air under pressure is admitted into the casing 1 at the inlet 10 so as to issue at 30 between the exterior of the mouth 20 of the cup 2 and the conical nozzle 3 in order to mix with molasses divergently discharging from the cup 2 and so break up the molasses into a fine spray.In order to obtain a more effective breaking up of the molasses and in accordance with this invention steam is also introduced into the molasses discharging from the cup 2 from a steam chest 44, i.e. through the annular clearance 40 between the conical nozzle 3 and the ring 4. The steam chest 44 is supplied with steam in any suitable manner not shown.The heating action of the steam renders the molasses less viscous so that it is more readily broken up into a finely divided spray by the combined action of the air and steam under pressure. The operation of the sprayer also has the advantage that intermixing of the steam with the molasses occurs beyond i.e. outside the sprayer thus directing heat away from the internal parts of the sprayer. Even so and Whereas the introduction of the steam has the desired effect of breaking up the discharging molasses into a fine spray, the heat of the steam may still have the undesired effect of causing caramelisation of the molasses in the cup 2 thus hindering, or everi preventing, discharge of molasses therefrom.In the arrangement shown this is prevented to a considerable extent by the fact that the air under pressure issues at 30 immediately adjacent the cup 2, i.e. between the latter and the conical nozzle 3 so as to act as a coolant flow between the cup 2 and the heat due to steam in the chest 44 which, after a period of use would otherwise cause heating of the cup 2 up to caramelisation temperature about 10400 . In order to ensure that caramelisation does not occur or build up during a period of operation of the sprayer, the interior of the cup 2 is arranged to be purged with steam preferably at regular intervals, the purging steam being introduced via an inlet passageway 63 and annular chamber or gallery 11 in the upper part of the casing 1 and from thence via one or more radial passageways 61 into the supply passageway 60 for molasses to the cup 2. Steam introduced in this way thus flushes the whole interior of the cup 2, i.e. the wall 22 and also the ported deflector 62 and thus enables proper flow of the molasses to be maintained. Such steam purging may take place for a period of six seconds every fifteen minutes and its admission to the passageway 63 may be effected by a timer controlled solenoid operated valve.Here again these periods may be varied according to requirements whilst the steam for this purpose may be from the same source of supply as that to the steam chest 44 or tapped off the latter. Alternatively a separate steam supply at 63 may be employed. The air inlet 10 to the chamber 1 may include a metering orifice.The base plate 5 on which the casing 1 is mounted together with the cup 2 and nozzles 3, 4 is shown hingedly mounted at 50 on a support plate or flange 70 of inlet passageway structure 7 to a cattle food or similar container, a readily releasable bolt connection 55 being provided to enable the complete sprayer 1 to be swung clear of the inlet passageway 7 for inspection or cleaning purposes. When the sprayer is in position of use fluidtight contact between the base plate 5 and support plate 70 is provided by an annular seal 8.As well as having an effective spraying action the sprayer also conveniently provides means for directing steam down the inlet passageway 7 for required heating or cooking of cattle food and also for dust abatement.
