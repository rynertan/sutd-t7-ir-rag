# Multiple microassay card and system.

## Abstract
A microassay card having a three layer laminate con struction in which various recessed channels and chambers are interconnected with protruding flexible chambers and channels to provide a completely self contained analytical system adapted for treating and analyzing a sample utilizing a multiple microassay rod. The configuration of the various channels and chambers are arranged so that a wide variety of analyses involving numerous steps can be accomplished using the card. The card is activated and analysis and or treatment carried out by passing a roller bar or other pressure device over the top of the card to force solutions and reagents through the various card channels. In addition, the movement of the pressure bar over the card closes and opens various channels within the card to provide controlled and programmable transfer of solutions during treatment of the microassay rod. A microassay rod having fluorescent marker layers is provided for use in analysis methods utilizing fluorescently marked detection substances.
