# Pile fabric.

## Abstract
Disclosed are thick and thin filaments the fineness of which changes gradually and periodically along the longitud inal direction thereof, which are characterized by a a thick and thin recurring length of five to 500 millimeters, b a thick and thin ratio of four to 50, c an average fineness of 0.005 to 2000 deniers, and d almost constant cross section areas at both the thick and the thin portions, respectively. Also disclosed are thick and thin staple fibres made therefrom by cutting the thick and thin laments at predetermined inter vals. Also disclosed are fabrics made of the thick and thin filaments or staple fibres as a component thereof. Disclosed is a method to produce the thick and thin filaments comprising 1 a step wherein molten fibre forming polymer is extruded through spinneret 9 holes at a constant throughput, 2 a step wherein the extruded filaments 22 run through a short gaseous gap 10 whose length is in the range of 0.1 to 6 millimeters before they plunge into liquid 11 for abrupt sol idification by cooling, 3 a step wherein the solidified undrawn filaments are touched by at least one vibrating guide before being withdrawn at a constant speed, 4 a step wherein the undrawn filaments are drawn by roller systems 21,26 and 5 a step wherein the drawn filaments are ther mally set by heaters 24,25 .
