# Electrical therapeutic apparatus.

## Abstract
A high voltage pulsed electrical stimulation apparatus is provided which is useful for a variety of therapeutic pur poses, and which is operable in a number of different modes of operation, including a continuous mode wherein the current is continuously applied, a surge mode wherein the current is periodically interrupted, and a reciprocate mode wherein a continuous current is alternately directed to two separate electrodes. The apparatus includes a meter 30 and associated circuitry 70 for measuring and visually display ing the peak current of the pulses, which has been found to provide a very reliable indication of the effectiveness of the treatment. Also, the apparatus includes a treatment intensity balance control 42 and associated circuitry 50, 51, 58 for balancing current between the two electrodes in the recipro cate mode, and which does not interfere with the desired peak current measurement. Further, circuitry 80, 81 is provided for effectively cushioning the initial application of current at the commencement of each surge of current when the apparatus is operated in the surge mode.
