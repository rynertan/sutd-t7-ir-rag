# SANITARY NAPKIN.

## Abstract
A sanitary napkin comprises an absorbant pad 10 , a soft case 12 containing the absorband pad 10 , a projec tion 13 formed at one end 12A of the soft case 12 which has a pattern of an emblem or a character s image, and a connector 15 provided at the other end 12B of the soft case 12 which can be connected to the projection 13 . The distasteful feeling of using a sanitary napkin can be re moved by the sight of the pattern or the image of the patter ned projection 13 , and the menstrual fluid can be con cealed by folding up the used sanitary napkin, so that the sanitary napkin can be handled easily and pleasantly.
