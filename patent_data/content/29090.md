# SULFON AMIDES CONTAINING A HINDERED PHENOL STABILIZED COMPOSITION CONTAINING A SYNTHETIC POLYMER AND SAID SULFON AMIDES

## Abstract
Bis sulfonamides containing one or more hindered phenol groups are disclosed, as is their use as thermal stabilizers for polymers. Further stabilization results from combinations thereof with a thiodipropionate ester and a divalent metal salt of a carboxylic acid.
