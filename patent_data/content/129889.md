Test example 3 s Effect on Myzus persicae Systemic insecticidal effect Formulation used A 10 wettable powder of the compounds described in Table 5. Formulation example 2 Control C A so wettable powder of Acephate O,S dimethyl N acetylphosphoroamidothiolate Method Myzus persicae were generated naturally on or cabbage plants with di to trifoliate. Then 200 ml of a chemical solution con taining 200 ppm of each of the active ingredient was retained in a plastic con tainer 6 9 cm . The roots of the above cabbage plants on which Myzus persicae were parasitic, were washed with water, then,adipped in each chemical solution. The number of Myzus persicae which were parasitic on the cabbage plant were counted. Then several pinholes were made in a lid of the con tainer and roots of the cabbage were gone through the lid, finally the plastic con tainer was cove red with the lid. The plastic container was left in a tempera ture controlled room for 4 days after the treatment, the number of alive adults and nympha of Myzus persicae was counted to calculate the control efficacy. The results are shown in Table 5.

After air drying, the leaf was placed in a small plastic container 69 cm x 6 cm . Then 15 larvae third instar of Plutella xvlostella were transferred into the con tainer. After covering with a lid having several pinholes, the container was left in a temperature controlled room at 25 OC. 48 hours after the treatment, the number of killed insects was counted to calculate the mortality.

Formulation example 1 Control E Chlorbenziliate ethyl p,p dichloro benzilate 45 emulsionMethod The primary leaf of a potted kidney bean plant was trimmed to a size of approxi mately 3 cm x 3 cm. Then 15 female adult mites, which were susceptible to organophosphorous insecti cides, were transferred onto the leaf using a small brush. Then the plant was left in a temperature controlled room at 250C. After one day, dead or abnormal mites were taken out of the leaf. The mites on the leaf were dipped in the chemical solution containing 200 ppm of each of the active ingredient for 10 seconds. After the treatment, the plant was left in the room again. 48 hours after the treatment, the number of killed mites was counted to calculate mortality. The results are shown in Table 8.
