# Fuel injection system.

## Abstract
A fuel injection system for an internal combustion engine has a fuel injector 10 disposed in a main air passage 33 up stream of a throttle valve 18 . A part of air flowing through the main air passage is caused to flow through a by pass air pas sage 5, 14 having outlet ports 8 open to the main air pas sage upstream of the injection orifice of the injector 10 . A thermal type air flow meter 7, 9 measures the rate of air flow through the by pass air passage. In order to prevent whirl ing up of injected fuel and resultant adhesion of the fuel to walls adjacent to the by pass air passage outlet ports 8 , the cross sectional area of the main air passage adjacent to the by pass air passage outlet ports 8 is determined to be grea ter than that of the main air passage around the throttle valve 18 when in its fully open position.
