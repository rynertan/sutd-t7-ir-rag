## Description
Novel Piperidinoquinazolines and a Process for the Preparation thereof The present invention relates to novel substituted 2 piperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazolines. The compounds have the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is an alkyl containing 1 to 5 carbons, a cycloalkyl containing 3 to 7 carbons, benzyl, an alkoxy containing 1 to 5 carbons, benzyloxy, or a group NR1R2, wherein R1 or R2 is hydrogen or a chained alkyl containing 4 to 5 carbons or wherein R1 and R2, together with a nitrogen atom, form a cyclic amino group containing 3 to 7 carbons, which group may be substituted by one or two lower alkyl groups. These compounds have a lowering effect on the blood pressure. It is known that certain esters and amides of piperidinecarboxylic acid lower the blood pressure A.P. Swain S.K.Naegele, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 79 1957 5250 J. Biel et al., ibid 79 1957 6181 J. Sam et awl., bid 81 1959 710 . On the other hand, it is known that 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline also lowers the blood pressure H. J. Hess,Clinical Symp. Proceed., San Francisco, May 16 17, 1974 .4 amino 6,7 dimethozyquinazoline appears also as a structural component in 2 4 2 furoyl piperazin 1 yl 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline or prazosin, which is a well known antihypertensive agent. 2 4 benzoyl piperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline and 2 4 2 thienoyl piperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethOxy quinazoline, for example, are known in the French patent specifications 2 350 101 and 2 389 621, and further, 2 2 diethylamino carbonylpiperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethOxy quinazoline, 2 4 n butyyliaminocarbonylpiperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline and 2 4 morpholinoarbonyl piperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline are known in the British patent application 2 021 108. The major side effect of prazosin is the first dose phenomenon which consists in an acute reaction characterized by dizziness, palpitations and sometimes loss of consciousness for periods of time which may range from a few minutes to over an hour I. Cavero and A.G. Roach The pharmacology of prazosin, a novel antihypertensive agent. Life Sciences.27, 1525 1540, 1980 . The strong initial fall of blood pressure is also observed in animal experiments. The great advantage of the new compounds according to the present invention over prazosin is the lack of a strong initial fall of blood pressure, but a gradual and long lasting lowering of the blood pressure level. Therefore no first dose phenomenon can be expected by the use of these drugs. The compounds of the formula I are prepared so that either a a 2 substituted 4,5 dimethozyaniline of the formulaIIEMI2.1 wherein Z is a cyano or amidino group, is reacted with an acylpiperidine. derivative of the formula IIIEMI2.2 wherein Z is a cyano or amidino group, b a 4 amino 6 ,7 dimethoxy 2 quinazolinyl halogenide of the formula IV EMI3.1 wherein X is chlorine or bromine and whose amino group is protected if desired, is reacted with an acylpiperidine of. the formula VEMI3.2 and the protective group, if any, is removed, c a S alkyl N cyano N T 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl isothiourea of the formula VIEMI3.3 wherein R is a lower alkyl group, is reacted with an acylpiperidine of the formula V, d an alkyl N 2 cyano 4,5 dimethoxyphenyl acyl piperidinothioformamidate derivative of the formula VIIEMI3.4 wherein R is a lower alkyl group, is reacted with ammonia, ammonium halogenide, urea, or urea hydrohalogenide, or e for the preparation of such compounds of the formulaI in which R is the group NR1H2, a 2 acylpiperidino 4amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline of the formula VIII EMI4.1 wherein COR3is an activated carboxyl group such as ester, mixed anhydride or acid halogenide, is reacted with an amine of the formula IX.EMI4.2 If desired, the final product may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as hydrochloride. The invention is also concerned with optically active 2or 3 acylpiperidines. The resolution may be performed either on the starting materials of the formula V, on the intermediates prepared from them, or on the final products of the formula I. The reaction in accordance with the process alternative a is preferably performed at an elevated temperature, in a polar aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, diinethyl acetamide or dimethylsulphoxide, and in the presence of an basic catalyst, such as alkalimetalalkoxide, amide, hydride or alkyl. Among the compounds of the formula II, 2 amino 4,5 benzonitrile is a known compound. The corresponding 2 amidino compound is obtained from it by treatment with hydroxylamine followed by catalytic hydrogenation. Compounds of the formula III wherein Z is a cyano group are obtained from corresponding acylpiperidines with the aid of cyanogenbromide. Compounds in which Z is an amidino group are obtained from corresponding methyl acylpiperidinothioformamidates with the aid of ammonia. The reaction in accordance with the process alternative b is preferably performed at an elevated temperature and in an inert solvent, such as isoamylalcohol. Halogenides of the formula IV to be used as the starting material can be prepared according to the process described in the U.S.patent 3.511 836. The amino group can be protected by means of conventional methods, e.g. in the way suggested in theFinnish Patent Application 771 741. Piperidines of the formula V wherein R is ethoxy or amino are readily available compounds. Compounds where R is 12 another alkoxy, benzyloxy or group NR R are obtained from the ethyl ester by conventional methods. Piperidines of the formula V wherein R is alkyl, cycloalkyl or benzyl are obtained by reacting N benzyl piperidine carbonitrile with alkyl , cycloalkyl or benzyl lithium or magnesium halogenide and removing the N benzyl group Thy catalytic hydrogenation. N benzyl piperidinecarbonitri3e is obtained by reacting carbamoylpiperidine with benzyl chloride and then with acetanhydride, thionyl chloride or diphosphorous pentoxide. The reaction in accordance with the process alternative c is preferably performed at an elevated temperature and in an inert solvent, such as diglycoldimethylether. The starting materials of formula VI can be prepared by reacting 3,4 di methoxyaniline with dimethylester of cyanamid dithiocarboxylic acid. The reaction in accordance with the process alternative d is preferably performed at an elevated temperature and in polar solvent, such as formamide. The compounds of formulaVII are novel, and they can be prepared advantageously by means of the process described in the Finnish Patent Application No. 800 482. Therein 2 amino 4,5 dimethoxybenzonitrile is reacted with thiophosgene to form 2 isothiocyanato 4,5 dimethoxybenzonitrile, which is reacted with acyl piperidine according to the formula V followed by alkylation with alkyl iodide to form the compound according to the formula VII. The reaction in accordance with the process alternative e is performed at an elevated temperature and in an inert solvent or, if possible, by using the reacting compound of the formula IX as a solvent. The compounds of the formulaVIII are novel, and they can be prepared advantageously by means of the process in accordance with the process alternative d . Especially the method according to alternative d has been found to be profitable. It is also suitable for the production of the compounds of the formula I in the industrial scale. All steps of this synthesis starting from amino 4,5 dimethoxybenzonitrile can be carried out in the same reactor without isolation of the intermediates. Wtlen ammonium chloride or urea hydrochloride is used as the reagent in the last step the product is obtained direct as the hydrochloride which is the prefered pharmaceutica form in most cases. More impurities are formed if the hydrochloride salt is precipitated with hydrochloric acid from the solution of the corresponding free base. The removal of these impurities may be quite troublesome. The effect of the compounds when administered intravenously was studied with male Wistar rats, 240 290 g,which were anaesthetised with urethane 1.5 g kg intraperitoneally . A heating pad which is controlled by a thermostate connected to the colonic thermistor probe was placed underneath the rats to keep the body temperature at 380c. The trachea was cannulated with a polyethylene tube and the rats were allowed to breathe spontaneously. A femoral vein was cannulated for intravenous injections of drugs. The blood pressure was measured from the femoral artery connected to a pressure transducer MP 15, Micron Instruments, Inc. . The pressure signals were amplified with a pressure conditioner HP 8805D .The mean arterial pressure was recorded on paper with a chart recorder. The effect of the drugs by oral administration on the spontaneous hypertension in conscious rats was studied by using a blood pressure recorder model no. 8002e, W W Electronics Inc. Basel . Spontaneously hypertensive rats of the Okamoto Aoki strain were used. The blood pressure was measured indirectly by a tail cuff method. After keeping the rats for 30 min. at 360C in a warming chamber to permit pulse waves be recorded, the rats were placed in a plexyglass cylinder, and six consecuetive systolic arterial pressure measurements were obtained from each rat. The arithmetic mean of these readings was taken as the systolic blood pressure. The effect of the compounds according to the present invention was compared with that of prazosin and two compounds disclosed in the British published patent application 2 021 108, viz. 2 4 diethylaminocarbonylpiperidino Li amino 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline reference compound A and 2 4 morpholinocarbonylpiperidino 4 amino 6,7 dimethoxy quinazoline reference compound B .
