# System for detecting two X ray energies.

## Abstract
A system comprising an X ray source 1 , an elongate detector tube 3 including at least one cathode 5 extending in the longitudinal direction of the tube and at least one anode 6 located opposite to the cathode, a slit diaphragm 2 , and a filter 4 mounted in the path between the X ray source 1 and the detector tube 3 . The filter 4 blocks relatively low energy X radiation in a portion of the beam emitted by the source 1 . The cathode 5 is provided with an X ray detection layer consisting of two strips 8 , 8 extend ing in the longitudinal direction of the tube 3 . One strip 8 receives the radiation passed by the filter 4 and the other strip 8 receives the unfiltered radiation. The one strip 8 is of considerably greater thickness than the other strip 8 .
