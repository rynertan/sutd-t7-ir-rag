# MULTIPLE MEASUREMENT NOISE REDUCING SYSTEM USING SPACE VARIANT FILTERS

## Abstract
Extraneous signals or artifacts are reduced in a multiple measurement noise reducing system such as an x ray imaging system by processing a plurality of measurements to obtain a first image signal of an object representing a desired parameter such as a blood vessel, processing the plurality of measurments to provide a second image signal having increased signal to noise, low pass filtering the first image signal, high pass filtering the second image signal and then combining the two filtered signals. The filter frequen cies are varied in response to the presence of atrifacts to minimize effects of the artifact on the combined signal.
