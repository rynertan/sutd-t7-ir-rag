# Ditcher method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An excavator wheel 15 provided with an annular array of peripheral scoops 16 is rotated about a horizontal axis while the wheel is moved along the terrain alongside a railroad track. The axis of rotation of the wheel is positioned selectively to be disposed within the range of perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the track to substantially parallel thereto whereby the scoops excavate a ditch corresponding ly in the range of a narrow trench having a width equal to the transverse extent of the scoops to a wide ditch having a profile corresponding generally to the circumference of the wheel. The wheel is carried on the distal end of a boom 20 having the opposite end mounted to a wheeled support. The wheels are carried on suitable trucks 53 adjustably con nected to the support to permit leveling of the support. In one form, the wheel is reversibly rotated and provided with double ended scoops to permit excavation in either direction of rotation of the wheel. In one form, the wheel is swingable about a vertical axis 18 on the distal end of the boom so as to be positionable on either side of the boom in use. The wheeled support, in one form, is provided with a laterally opening recess 60 for accommodating the wheel in a storage position. The excavated material, in the illustrated embodiment, is conveyed from the excavator wheel by conveyor belts for desired disposal selectively at either side of the railroad track or to a suitable hopper car. The excavator wheel is arranged to drop the excavated material downwardly from the scoops at an upper position onto a subjacent conveyor belt for disposal.
