# Perfluorodioxole and its polymers.

## Abstract
Perfluoro 1,3 dioxole is a useful monomer, which poly merizes to either amorphous or liquid homopolymers and co polymerizes with tetrafluoroethylene as well as with other mo nomers to both crystalline and amorphous copolymers having one or more such comonomers incorporated therein. Amor phous homopolymers and copolymers of perfluoro 1,3 dioxole are useful in such applications as glazing for reactors for hy drogen fluoride reactions. Amorphous homopolymers and amorphous or crystalline copolymers form self supporting films and can be used for coatings and linings which are inert to most chemicals and are stain and weather resistant and as dielectrics for electrical and electronic equipment. Liquid homopolymers can be used as hydraulic fluids and heat ex change media.
