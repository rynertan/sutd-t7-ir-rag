## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2 CHLOROSULFONyL 4 N SUBSTITUTED SULFAMYL CHLOROBENZENE COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds. More particularly, the present invention relates to a new industrially valuable process for the preparation of 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds in one stage fram 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene. 2 Chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds are known to be important as intermediates in the preparation of certain compounds having pharmacological activity. For example, 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 fN methyl N a methyltetrahydrofur furyl sulfamyl chlorobenzene of the formula EMI1.1 is useful as an intermediate in the preparation of a substance exhibiting excellent diuretic activity, i.e.this compound is extremely valuable as a precursor for 2 sulfamyl 4 IN methyl M a methyl tetrahydrofurfuryl sulfamyl chlorobenzene of the formula EMI2.1 However, these 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds, the end products of the present invention, have heretofore been prepared by an industrially very disadvantageous method.Previously, it was practically impossible to effect amidation at the 4 position alone of 2,4 dichloro sulfanyl chloro buwsne. In the prior art methods, therefore 2 dichlorosulfan 4 sulfamyl chlorobenzenecompounds were prepared by incorporating at the 2 position of 4 chlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene, a functional group which is not sensitive to amidation Of the chlorosulfonyl group in the 4 position i.e. sulfamylation , and then converting the functional group in the 2 position, after the amidation in the 4 position with an amine, to a chlorosulfonyl group by a multistage reaction including the Meerwein reaction. These methods require several reaction vessels and are complicated and troublesome operations which are quite disadvantageous, particularly in that the overall yield of the end product does not reach a satisfactory level and the methods per se are not commercially attractive. There is thus a great demand in this art for developing a new advantageous method for preparing 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds in a high yield without the above mentioned drawbacks. We have now surprisingly found that 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene can be successfully be prepared in a high yield in one step from 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene by selectively effecting amidation of the chlorosulfonyl group in the 4 position only. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of 2 chloro sulfonyl 4 N substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene compounds of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, X is a 5 or 6 membered carbocyclic group which may contain an oxygen atom or atoms as ring constituting members and may be substituted on the ring by one or more lower alkyl groups and n is 0 or 1, which process comprises reacting a 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene of the formula EMI4.1 with an amine of the general formula R NH CH2 n X III wherein R, X and n are as defined above in the presence of an acid binding agent at a temperature of below 100 C, preferably below OOC and more preferably below 400C. Of the reactants used in the process of this invention, 2, 4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene of the formula II is commercially available and can easily be prepared by the chlorosulfonation of chlorobenzene using a conventional procedure. Primary or secondary amines of the general formula III are known and also commercially available. These amines can of course be prepared as required by methods known per se. The group R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group which may be straightor branched chain and contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of R as an alkyl group include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, n pentyl, isopentyl, n hexyl and 2 ethylbutyl. The group X in principle contains no unsaturated double bond and is generally a Cos 6 alicyclic group which contains one or two oxygen atoms as ring constituting members in place of one or two ring carbon atoms and may be substituted by one or two lower alkyl groups on the ring carbon atoms. This lower alkyl group as a ring substituent is of the same type as referred to above with respect to the group R.Examples of the group X thus include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, tetrahydrofurfuryl, tetrahydropyranyl and 1,4 dioxan 2 yl, as well as their ringsubstituted lower alkyl homologs. Any base usually employed for condensation reactions accompanied by the liberation of an acid can be used as the acid binding agent in the process of this invention. Examples of suitable acid binding agents arse inorganic bases such as alkali metal hydroxides, for example, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide, and alkali metal carbonates and bicarbonates, for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and organic bases such as tertiary amines, for example, triethylamine, tri npropylamine, tri n butylamine, pyridine, picolines, lutidines and collidines, and quaternary ammonium hydroxides, for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide.The use of a tertiary amine, especially triethylamine, is preferred because it forms a homogeneous system with the solvent used and the amine of the general formulaIII. Any organic solvents which is inert to the reaction can be used in the process of this invention.Illustrative of utilizable organic solvents are, for example, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate and organic tertiary bases such as pyridine, triethylamine and trin propylamine. In general, polar solvents as exemplified above are preferred to non polar solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons, because the latter tend to involve disadvantages in after treatments. As organic tertiary bases such as pyridine or triethylamine function both as the acid binding agent and solvent, a large excess amount of the organic tertiary base can be used for such dual purpose. The reactants in the process of this invention, i.e., 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene and an amine of the general formula III are generally used in a stoichiometric amount. However, either of the reactants may be used in a slight excess amount. The acid binding agent is generally used in a stoichi metric amount necessary to combine with the acid liberated during the condensation reaction of the reactants. When an organic tertiary base is used it may be used in a large excess amount so that it is also effective as the organic solvent. The process of the present invention is generally carriedout.ky adding a solution. of an amine of the general formula III and the acid binding agent in an organic solvent to a solution of 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene in the organic solvent and the mixture is then stirred until the condensation reaction is completed.The use of the same organic solvent to dissolve the reactants is convenient to simplify the after treatment. The above condensation reaction should be carried out at a temperature below 10 C, preferably 0 C and more preferably 400C. The establishment of this low reaction temperature is the most important feature of the present invention. Under these low temperature conditions, the 4 chlorosulfonyl group alone of the starting 2, 4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene is selectively amidated but the 2 chlorosulfonyl group is not attacked, or even if it is attacked, the resultant 2 amidated andi or 2,4 diamidated product is present in an extremely small amount and can easily be separated and eliminated from the desired product after the reaction. The formation of such by products becomes negligible as the reaction temperature adopted is lowered.Accordingly, the reaction can advantageously be conducted at a temperature below 00C,.preferably 400C. As the amidation.takes place selectively in the 4 position of the starting 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene, the end product is obtained not only in a very high yield but also very pure. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is treated in a conventional manner to isolate the end product in a pure state. For example, the reaction mixture may be concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure whereby the solvent used is recovered.The residue is then purified by column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography using, for example, silica gel as sorption agent followed by recrystallization from benzene n hexane. If necessary, the residue may be subjected to a preliminary purifying treatment prior to the chromatographic purification, which comprises taking up the residue in a waterimmiscible organic solvent, washing the solution with water several times and then removing the solvent under reduced pressure. Such a preliminary purifying treatment is sometimes necessary when an inorganic acid binding agent is used in the main reaction step. The thus purified end product is usually in the form of a white crystalline powder. It is indeed a most important advantage of the presentinvention that the amidation reaction takes place selectively in the 4 position only of the starting 2,4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene so that, the end product can be obtained in a high yield and with good purity. Furthermore, some additional advantages can also be achieved by the present invention.First, the product produced by the present invention represented by the general formula I can be further reacted, without the necessity of isolation from the reaction liquid, directly with ammonia or a substance capable of producing ammonia, such as ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate, whereby the 2 chlorosulfonyl group in the compound of the general formula I can readily be converted into a 2 sulfamyl group to produce a compound of the general formulaEMI10.1 wherein R, X and n are as defined above, which is useful as a diuretic. Thus, the process of this invention is of important utility from an industrial point of view.Secondly, the process of this invention is advantageous in that a pharmacologically useful sulfamyl compound of the general formula V , for example, 2 sulfamyl 4 N methyl M a methyltetra hydrofurfuryl sulfamyll chlorobenzene can be prepared economically in.3 steps starting from chlorobenzene and in only 2 steps starting from 2,4 dichlorosulfonylchlorobenzene. In addition, a pharmacologically valuable compound of the general formula V can be obtained, as described above, from the end product of the present invention, i.e. 2 chlorosulfonyl 4 lN substituted sulfamyl chlorobenzene of the general formula I by the treatment described above. A great economic advantage can thus be achieved by the process of the present invention. The present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by way of examples and reference examples.In the reference examples, a series of reactions starting from 2, 4 dichlorosulfonyl chlorobenzene for preparing pharmacologically valyable compounds are illustrated wherein the process of the present invention is included as the former half of the reaction. In laboratory scale reactions illustrated in these examples and reference examples, a temperature as low as 690C of the solution was made by external cooling of the reaction vessels containing the solution with a mixture of trichlorothylene and dry ice as the coolant. A mixture of dry ice and ethanol may also be used as the coolant.
