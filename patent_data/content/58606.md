# Atrial and ventricular pacemaker.

## Abstract
A programmable pacemaker pulse generator capable of operating in several atrial and ventricular pacing modes having atrial and ventricular sense amplifiers and output circuits and programmable memory and clock controlled digital timing circuits for selectively delivering stimulating pulses to the heart in an atrial synchronous mode of operation. The ventricular sense amplifier has a blanking and refractory period following the sensing of a ventricular heartbeat or the occurrence of a stimulation pulse. Delay means are operatively connected to the atrial sense amplifier operate to trigger the generation of a ventricular stimulating pulse after an A V delay interval following a sensed atrial depolarization. The A V delay interval is lengthened by means responsive to the detection of two or more ventricular depolarizations without an intervening atrial depolarization, so as to avoid the application of a ventricular stimulating pulse into the vulnerable period or T wave of the heart. In addition, the ventricular refractory period is prolonged by a like interval. In this way the timer intervals are prolonged by a like interval. In this way the time intervals are prolonged to alleviate the possibility of harmful pacing into the heart s vulnerable period while allowing the ventricular stimulating pulse to be delivered after the delay in synchrony with the detected P wave.
