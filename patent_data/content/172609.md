# Data transcription magnetic head assembly.

## Abstract
A data transcription magnetic head assembly of the rotating type, includes an auxiliary pole 23 having a tip arranged to be disposed adjacent the first side of a recording medium 22 and a winding 18 around the auxiliary pole. A pole carrier 14 has an end face 26 and a periphery 27 whose intersection with the end face is a circle 29 , the pole carrier 14 being mounted for rotation about an axis 11 centred on and perpendicular to the circle of intersection. and positioned to place at least an arc of the circle of intersection in substantially contacting relationship along its length across a second side of the recording medium 22 . A main pole 15 is mounted on the pole carrier 14 and has transcribing tips 30 coincident with the circle of intersection 29 such that for each revolution of the pole carrier, the transcribing tips 30 are directed toward and sweeps across the recording medium 22 along the arc of the circle of intersection in substantially contacting relationship with the recording medium and adjacent to the auxiliary pole tip to allow data transcription.
