# Sterilization of adsorbent and column having improved storability including sterilized adsorbent for use in extracorporeal circulation treatment.

## Abstract
A process for steam sterilizing an adsorbent for use in extracorporeal circulation treatment comprising a water in soluble support and a sulfated polysaccharide immobilized on the support, characterized by sterilizing the adsorbent in an aqueous medium maintained at pH 5 to 9, whereby the sulfated polysaccharide is prevented from releasing from the support and being deactivated. When the water insoluble support sulfated polysaccharide adsorbent is packed in a col umn with an aqueous buffer solution having a pH 5 to 9 to provide an adsorption column for use in extracorporeal cir culation treatment, release and deactivation of the sulfated polysaccharide are prevented and the column can be stored for a long term.
