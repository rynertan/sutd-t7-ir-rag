# Stacking apparatus for paper sheets.

## Abstract
In a paper sheet stacking apparatus according to the pre sent invention, continuously fed paper sheets P are received by rotating blade wheels 9a, 9b , and are then dropped from the blade wheels 9a, 9b at a predetermined position by means of a stationary stop 2c . A separator 16 capable of rotating coaxially with the blade wheels 9a, 9b is stopped at the paper sheet dropping position to bear thereon the first of many sheaves of paper sheets to be allotted out of the drop ped paper sheets P . The paper sheets P on the separator 16 is temporarily transferred to an auxiliary stacking unit 51 , and the separator 16 is removed from the blade wheels 9a, 9b . Then, the separator 16 is rotated without touching the paper sheets P and stopped at a position beside a stand by position where it waits for the first paper sheet out of the next sheaf of paper sheets P to be inserted into the blade wheels 9a, 9b . Thereafter, the separator 16 is moved further toward the blade wheels 9a, 9b and stopped at the stand by position. Meanwhile, the paper sheets P on the auxiliary stacking unit 51 are transferred to a main stacking unit 41 so that the main stacking unit 41 can receive and bear thereon the paper sheets P to be dropped thereafter. Thus, regular sheaves Po of paper sheets P each consisting of a predetermined number of sheets may successively be formed on the main stacking unit 41 without interrupting the feed of the paper sheets P to the blade wheels 9a, 9b .
