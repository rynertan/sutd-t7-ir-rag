# A data carrier system, especially a subscriber digital data carrier system, and a frequency synthesizer suitable therefor.

## Abstract
A transmission system providing for simultaneous con ventional baseband telephone signaling and digital data transmission between a pair of subscribers A and B on non loaded telephone 13 and 17 wires. The system includes a modem 21 located near each telephone 23 . Each modem 21 is connected to the telephone 23 and to digital data termi nals 25 and includes a data transmitter that converts digital data to be transmitted from binary form into F1 F2 FSK form and a receiver that converts received digital data from F3 F4 form into binary form. A repeater 33 located at a central office 11 bidirectionally converts the F1 F2 FSK signals pro duced by one subscriber A or B into F3 F4 FSK signals for receipt by the other subscriber B or A . The subsystems include voice frequency filters for presenting FSK signals for reaching telephones and line switching equipment and high frequency noise signals generated by the telephones from reaching the nonloaded telephone wires 13,17 .
