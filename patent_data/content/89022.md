# Alkanoylpyridinones useful as cardiotonics and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
3 Q 4 R2 5 Lower alkanoyl 6 lower alkyl 2 1H pyridinones I , useful as cardiotonics, where Q is hydrogen or cyano, R2 is hydrogen or methyl, are prepared by reacting 2 lower alkanoyl 1 lower alkyl ethenamine II with lower alkyl 2 propynoate or 2 butynoate respectively or by hydrolyzing 4 R2 5 lower alkanoyl 6 lower alkyl 1,2 dihydro 2 oxonicotinonitrile or corresponding 4 R2 5 lower alkanoyl 6 lower alkyl 1,2 dihydro 2 oxonicotinamide to produce the corresponding 5 lower alkanoyl 6 lower alkyl 1,2 dihydro 2 oxonicotonic acid and decarboxylating said substituted nicotinic acid to produce I. Also shown and claimed is methyl 4 acetyl 5 amino 2,4 hexadienoate or acid addition salt thereof, useful as intermediate or cardiontonic.
