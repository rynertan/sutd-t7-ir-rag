## Description
THE USE OF ARALKANOIC ACIDS AND ESTERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA This invention relates to the use of aralkanoic acid and esters in the treatment of myelogenous leukemia. Myelogenous leukemia, a non lymphocytic leukemia, occurs in children and adults in two forms, acute and chronic. Various treatment regimens have been used, using cytotoxic agents for chemotherapeutic treatment. These cytotoxic agents are, for example, busulf an, chlorambucil, 6 mercaptopurine, vincristine, doxorubicin, cytarabine, methotrexate and 5 azacytidine. Combinations of these cytotoxic agents have been used, in various sequences, for example, as disclosed in Treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia in Children and Adults , Weinstein et al.,The New England Journal of Medicine, 303, no. 9, August 28, 1980, pp. 473 478. Dosage regimens using a single cytotoxic agent have been used, as disclosed in Cancer, 47, no. 7, April 1, 1981, pp. 1739 1742 and Annals ofInternal Medicine, 85 1976 pp. 237 245. Flurbiprofen and ibuprofen are non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAID which have been used in rheumatic and degenerative diseases of the joints and for reducing platelet adhesiveness. The active compounds of the present invention are flurbiprofen 3 fluoro 4 phenylhydratropic acid and ibuprofen p isobutylhydratropic acid , their C18 alkyl esters and pharmacologically acceptable salts. The esters can be the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, pentyl, and octyl esters. Pharmacologically acceptable salts can be, for example, the alkali metal, alkaline earth, and ammonium salts. The compositions of the present invention are preferably presented for systemic administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, suppositories, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, sterile nonparenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions and the like, containing suitable quantities of an active ingredient. For oral administration either solid or fluid unit dosage forms can be prepared. Powders are prepared quite simply by comminuting the active ingredient to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comnin uted diluent. The diluent can be an edible carbohydrate material such as lactose or starch. Advantageously, a sweetening agent or sugar is present as well as a flavoring oil. Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture as hereinafter described and filling into formed gelatin sheaths. Advantageously, as an adjuvant to the filling operation, a lubricant such as talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and the like is added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry of active ingredients with an acceptable vegetable oil, light liquid petrolatum or other inert oil or triglyceride. Tablets are made by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and pressing into tablets. The powder mixture is prepared by mixing an active ingredient, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base such as starch, lactose, kaoline, dicalcium phosphate and the like. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as corn syrup, gelating solution, methylcellulose solution or acacia mucilage and forcing through a screen.As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be slugged, i.e., run through the tablet machine and the resulting imperfectly formed tablets broken into pieces slugs . The slugs can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearic salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. Advantageously, the tablet can be provided with a protective coating consisting of a sealing coat or enteric coat of shellac, a coating of sugar and methylcellulose and a polish coating of carnauba wax. Fluid unit dosage forms for oral administration such as syrups, elixirs and suspensions can be prepared wherein each teaspoonful of composition contains a predetermined amount of active ingredient for administration. The water soluble forms can be dissolved in an aqueous vehicle together with sugar, flavoring agents and preservatives to form a syrup. An elixir is prepared by using a hydroalcoholic vehicle with suitable sweeteners together with a flavoring agent.Suspensions can be prepared of the insoluble forms with a suitable vehicle with the aid of a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, methylcellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing an active ingredient and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The active ingredient, depending on the form and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle.In preparing solutions the water soluble active ingredient can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that an active ingredient is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The active ingredient can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active ingredient. The term unit dosage form as used in the specification and claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for humans and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specification for the novel unit dosage forms of this invention are dictated by and are directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitation inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for therapeutic use in humans, as disclosed in this specification, these being features of the present invention.Examples of suitable unit dosage forms in accord with this invention are tablets, capsules, troches, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, cachets, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, dropperfuls, ampules, vials, segregated multiples of any of the foregoing, and other forms as herein described. The systemic administration of flurbiprofen or ibuprofen, their salts or esters in conjunction with the treatment of acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia in adults and children provides a method of enhance induction of complete remission, prolong remission time or reduce toxicity to non cancerous cells of the bone marrow, precursor cells or skin cells. The dose of flurbiprofen, its salts or esters, for treating acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia according to the present invention is the same dose known for treating conditions for which it is previously known to be useful. In general, from about 2.5 mg to about 5 mg per kilogram body weight is administered daily in single or divided dosage amounts. For remission induction of acute myelogenous leukemia using a single cytotoxic agent e.g., 5 azacytidine , flurbiprofen is administered for 1 2 days followed by a drug free interval of 6 hours after which a single cytotoxic agent is administered for 12 hours. After this a drug free interval of 18 hours is followed by another cycle of flurbiprofen and cytotoxic agent. The number of cycles administered is determined by evaluation of the status of bone marrow during the 18 hours drug free interval. When complete remission occurs, flurbiprofen is administered daily, at a dose of 200 mg per day until 2 days prior to recommencement of administration of cytotoxic agent. The flurbiprofen when used for remission induction in conjunction with a regimen of multiple cytotoxic agents, is not administered on days when the cyctotoxic agents are administered but rather an intermittant schedule is followed. The flurbiprofen is administered for 3 days at 300 mg day average adult then no drug is administered for 1 day and then chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents is commenced. When cytotoxic agents are stopped and remission has been accomplished, the flurbiprofen is administered daily at 200 mg day average adult until 2 days prior to recommencement of administration of cytotoxic agents used for maintenance chemotherapy. The dose of ibuprofen, its salts or esters, for treating acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia according to the present invention is the same dose known for treating conditions for which it is previously known to be useful. In general, from about 25 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight is administered daily in single or divided dosage amounts. For children about 30 mg kg is used. For remission induction of acute myelogenous leukemia using a single cytotoxic agent e.g., 5 azacytidine , ibuprofen is administered for 1 2 days followed by a drug free interval of 6 hours after which a single cytotoxic agent is administered for 12 hours. After this a drug free interval of 18 hours is followed by another cycle of ibuprofen and cytotoxic agent. The number of cycles administered is determined by evaluation of the status of bone marrow during the 18 hours drug free interval. When complete remission occurs, ibuprofen is administered daily, at a dose of 2000 mg per day until 2 days prior to recommencement of administration of cytotoxic agent. The ibuprofen when used for remission induction in conjunction with a regimen of multiple cytotoxic agents, is not administered on days when the cytotoxic agents are administered but rather an intermittant schedule is followed. The ibuprofen is administered for 3 days at 2400 mg per day average adult then no drug is administered for 1 day and then chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents is commenced.When cytotoxic agents are stopped and remission has been accomplished, the ibuprofen is administered daily at 1600 mg per day average adult until 2 days prior to recommencement of adminstration of cytotoxic agents used for maintenance chemotherapy. The course of the disease is followed and determined by bone marrow biopsy, i.e., diagnosis of the disease, induction of remission, state of remission and relapse.
