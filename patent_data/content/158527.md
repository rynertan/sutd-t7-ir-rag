# AUTOMATIC BALER

## Abstract
An automatic baling machine for forming round bales of crop material and wrapping them with twine is provided with a microprocessor controlled signal processing circuit 804 for controlling movement of a bidirectional motor 812 which drives a pair of twine tubes. A retract extend switch 800 is manually operable by an operator to store in the signal processing circuit a sequence of control words which are subsequently executed to control movement of the twine tube drive motor. In addition to being connected to the input of the signal processing system, the retract extend switch 800 is connected in parallel with the signal processing circuit 808 to actuate the twine tube motor.
