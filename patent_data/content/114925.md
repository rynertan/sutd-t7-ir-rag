# Process for making anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for reducing the water content of a lower alkanesulfonic acid. The process compris es placing a mixture containing water and said lower alkanesulfonic acid onto the internal surface of an evaporator column, operating said column at subatmospheric pressure and heating said surface so that water is vaporized from said mixture, removing water vapor at the top of said column, and removing lower alkanesulfonic acid having a reduced water content at the bottom of said column.
