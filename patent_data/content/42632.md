## Description
Recording material and method for the production of metal images The present invention relates to a recording material for the production of metal images by informationwise photoexposure and peel apart processing. The application of photoadhesion in the recording and reproduction of information by a peel apart processing is described by Woodruff et al. in Photogr.Sci.Eng., 11, 93 1967 . They discovered that the adhesion of a photopolymerizable layer to a continuous film or support could be changed by photoexposure and called the phenomenon photoadhesion. A selected structure for practical application of photoadhesion comprises a pigmented photopolymer layer between a smooth polyethylene terephthalate cover film and a base film having a roughened surface. The unexposed pigmented photopolymer layer adheres preferentially to the base instead of to the cover film. The photopolymer layer composition is adjusted so that its cohesive strength is greater than the apparent adhesions to the continuous films. After image wise exposure to ultraviolet radiation through the cover film the apparent adhesion to the cover film is increased image wise. On peeling apart the films an image of photoexposed portions of the pigmented photopolymer layer selectively adheres to the cover film. Such results in a negative image on the cover film and in a positive image on the base. The pigmenting of the photopolymer layer always gives rise to a reduction of the photosensitivity and therefore recording material structures are preferred wherein the photosensitive element is separate from the element containing the substance s responsible for optical density. A peel apart recording material wherein the photosensitive layer is separate from the imaging layer is described in the published German Patent Appljcation DE OS 2,716,422. Said recording material comprises a photosensitive polymeric binder layer incorporating as photosensitive compound benzophenone, a quinone compound, a diazonium compound or an azido compound and is coated onto a metal imaging layer, which in its turn is coated in adhering contact to a support. For use in photodelamination imaging it is essential that the adhering of said photosensitive binder layer in unexposed state is stronger to the metal layer than the adherence of said metal layer to the support. In the photoexposed parts, however, the adhesion is changed in such a way that the photosensitive binder layer loses some of its adherence to the metal layer.On peeling, the structure breaks at the interface metal layer support in correspondence with the non photoexposed parts resulting with respect to an original used in the exposure in a positive metal image on the peeled apart binder layer and in a negative metal image on the support. Diazonium compounds and azide compounds are known for the photogeneration of nitrogen gas but are unstable and provide explosion hazards on storage and handling.Benzophenone has a low sensitivity for use in peel apart recording material and quinone compounds are already coloured by themselves so that positive images with non neutral i.e. coloured image background are obtained. In accordance with the present invention a novel photosensitive recording material for peel apart processing is provided wherein a photosensitive binder layer is used that on exposure to actinic radiation undergoes a reduction in adhesive power towards a metal layer. The present photosensitive recording layer contains photosensitive substances that by exposure to actinic radiation very effectively lower the adherence of said layer towards a metal layer e.g. a vacuum coated aluminium layer. More particularly the recording material of the present invention being suited for the production of metallic images by information wise photoexposure and peel apart processing comprises a support carrying a metal layer in adhering contact therewith, the said metal layer being covered on its outer surface in adhering contact with a photosensitive binder layer that undergoes a reduction in adhering power towards the said metal layer on exposure to actinic light, the adherence of said metal layer towards said photosensitive layer in unexposed state being stronger than towards said support so that by overall peeling apart of the thus exposed photosensitive layer from the said support said metal layer can be detached from the support areas corresponding to unexposed areas of the said photosensitive binder layer but is otherwise left adhering onto the support, characterized in that the binder of the said photosensitive layer consists of or contains 1 a photosensitive material that is capable of releasing CO, gas on exposure to actinic radiation and or 2 a photosensitive material that is capable of yielding a hydrohalic acid on exposure to actinic radiation. The present method for the production of metal images comprises the steps of 1 information wise photoexposing the photosensitive binder layer of the recording material of the present invention to actinic radiation up to a dosage wherein the adhesion of the exposed parts of the photosensi tive layer to said metal layer becomes smaller than the adhesion of the support to said metal layer, and 2 peeling apart the photosensitive binder layer to detach the metal layer from the support in the non exposed portions leaving parts of said metal layer corresponding with the photoexposed parts of the photosensitive layer on the support. The peeling apart procedure is preferably effected by pulling an adhesive tape or sheet forming before or after the photoexposure an adhered layer to the photosensitive binder layer. The adherence of said adhesive tape or sheet to the photosensitive binder layer has to be strong enough to allow the photosensitive binder layer and the parts of the metal layer corresponding with the unexposed parts of the photosensitive binder layer, together to be peeled away from the support. The required degree of adhesiveness is provided by a large variety of commercially available adhesive tapes or sheets. When the adhesive tape or sheet is applied before the information wise photoexposure of the photosensitive binder layer a transparent adhesive tape or sheet is used and the information wise photoexposure of the photosensitive binder layer proceeds through said tape or sheet. According to a first embodiment the present recording material contains in the photosensitive binder layer a photosensitive C02 releasing substance. A preferred substance for said purpose is an organic compound containing at least one oxime ester group of the structure C N O CO R, wherein R is an organic group. An alternative term for oxime ester is O acyloxime . Specific oxime esters that can be used as photosensitive C02 releasing compounds correspond to one of the following general formulae andEMI5.1 whereinR4 represents an alkyl group containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms, an aryl group, an alkaryl group, an aralkyl group, a hydroxy substituted aralkyl group, or an acyl group including a substituted acyl group,R5 represents one of the groups of R4 or a hydrogen atom, 4 or wherein R and R5 together represent the necessary atoms to form with the adjacent carbon atom a cyclo alkyl group, a phenanthrone group, or an indazone group, R6 represents an acyl group including a substituted acyl group, andR7 represents a diacyl group. Preferably at least one of R and R5 is an acyl group including a substituted acyl group. The acyl groups forR4, R5 and R6 are preferably acyl groups derived from aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulphonic acids, e.g.benzoyl, phenylsulphonyl, naphthoyl, anthraquinonylcarbonyl, acetyl, propionyl, phenylacetyl, cinnamoyl, alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl and N substituted carbamoyl e.g. N phenylcarbamoyl. Particularly suitable non polymeric as well as polymeric compounds containing at least one oxime ester group, the so called oxime esters or O acyloximes, are those disclosed in the US Patent Specification 3,558,309. Particularly useful are the oxime esters of Table 1.Table 1EMI5.2 EMI6.1 Film forming binder polymers comprising oxime ester groups as integral parts of the main polymer chain for use in photodegradable layers are described in UnitedKingdom Patent Specification 1,180,845. The photo decomposition of such compounds is discussed in the Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Technology Supplement Vol. 1 1976 John Wiley Sons Inc.USA p.435 and proceeds with 1 phenyl 1,2 propanedione 2 O benzoyloxime as followsEMI6.2 Other useful C02 releasing compounds are described in the United States Patent Specifications 3,877,941 and 3,918,973. Still other useful compounds for photochemical CO2 release are nitro compounds from which aci anion intermediates are produced by photochemical decarboxylation.Examples of such compounds are described in Photogr.Sci. Eng. Vol. 12 1968 p.181, e.g. ortho and para nitrophenylacetic acid and derivatives the reof. The photodecarboxylation of p nitrophenylacetic acid proceeds as followsEMI7.1 According to a second embodiment the present recording material contains in the photosensitive binder layer a substance capable of yielding a halogen radical s on exposure to actinic radiation in admixture with a substance acting as hydrogen donor. A substance capable of yielding halogen radicals on exposure to actinic radiation e.g. UV radiation is e.g. a homopolymer or copolymer of halogenated , ethy lenically unsaturated monomer s e.g. is a homopolymer or a copolymer that contains vinyl chloride and or vinylidene chloride units. A preferred halogenated copolymer serving also as binder for the photosensitive binder layer is SARAN F 220 trade mark of The Dow Chemicals Company, Midland, MI, U.S.A. for a copoly vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile 80 20 percent by weight . Said copolymer has a stronger adherence to vacuum coated aluminium than the aluminium has to polyethylene terephthalate. According to a particular embodiment instead of using an halogenated polymer or copolymer a non polymeric photohalogen radical forming organic compound can be used, in combination with halogenated polymer s or copolymer s or with an other binding agent s e.g. a non polymeric compound corresponding to the following general formula whereinEMI7.2 each of A, B, X and Y are chlorine, bromine or iodine, or wherein one of said radicals A, B, X or Y represents an alkyl group including a substituted alkyl group e.g. a halogen substituted alkyl radical, a hydroxyalkyl radical or an aralkyl radical e.g. a benzyl radical, an aryl group including a substituted aryl group or an aroyl group and the other radicals represent chlorine, bromine or iodine, or wherein one or two of said radicals A, B, X or Y represent an aromatic acyl group e.g. a benzoyl group and the other radicals represent chlorine, bromine or iodine. Suitable representatives falling within the scope of that general formula are carbon tetrabromide, bromoform, iodoform, hexachloroethane, hexabromoethane, pentabromoethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrabromoethane, ,a, tribromoacetophenone and tribromoethanol. Suitable hydrogen donating compounds capable of forming a hydrohalic acid with a photochemically formed halogen radical are, e.g. organic compounds having a hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom to which a substituent is also attached that greatly weakens the carbon to hydrogen bond, thereby rendering the hydrogen atom labile. Compounds of that type are described in the US Patent Specification 3,880,659. In particular cases the compound yielding halogen radicals at the same time may be the source of labile hydrogen atoms as is the case with polymers containing vinyl chloride units and with iodoform. Preferred hydrogen donating compounds are silver halide reducing agents within the scope of the general formula R1 x1 X2 1 R2 wherein each of RÚ and Rê sameor different are 0h, NH2, NHR or NRRX1 isEMI8.1 EMI9.1 or N , R being an organic group, and n is an integer from 1 to 5. Examples of these compounds are described by T.H.James in The Theory of the Photographic Process, 4th ed. 1977 , Macmillan Publishing Co Inc., p. 299. Other compounds having a labile hydrogen atom and that are very effective in the present process are 4 alkoxynaphthol compounds, e.g. 4 methoxynaphthol. Particularly useful results are obtained by using in admixture with said substance capable of photochemically producing a halogen radical s a compound acting as sensitizing agent by increasing the production of halogen radicals, and or a compound acting as hydrohalic acidacceptor by salt formation. Preferred organic sensitizing compounds that may have one or more of said capacities are described in the UnitedKingdom Patent Specification 1,359,472 in the classes C to F .

Examples thereof are listed in Table 7. Usable 7EMI15.2 EMI16.1 The N vinyl polymers and copolymers of class B can be prepared by application of one of the various known polymerization procedures, e.g., by suspension or emulsion polymerization or by polymerization in solution, whereby the initiation of the polymerization can occur by free radicals, by ion formation, or by radiation e.g., with actinic light. It is to be noted that the molecular weight of the polymer is not critical and can vary between wide limits. As far as the copolymers are concerned, it is further to be noted that the content of groups corresponding to the general formula given hereinbefore is not critical and can vary between wide limits, say, e.g.between 20 and 95 , taking into account the properties of the compounds used in preparation of the copolymers and the required sensitizing and or mechanical properties.In general, the best results are attained with copolymers having a content of vinylcarbazole units between 40 and 90 by weight. The preparation of suitable poly N vinylcarbazoles is described in German Patent Specifications 931.,731 936,421 1,097,680 and 1,158,367, and in United StatesPatent Specification 2,072,465. The preparation of poly N vinyl pyrrole proceeds analogously. The preparation of suitable N vinylcarbazole copolymers is described in United Kingdom Patent Specification 964,875 which specification also contains a preparation recipe for poly N allyl carbazqle R1 CH3 and R2 H and for poly N propenyl carbazole R1 R, R2 H, A CH2 . The poly N vinyl indoles are described in publishedGerman Patent Specifications 1,906,831 and 1,917,747.The poly N vinyl diphenylamine is described in the published German Patent Specification 2,007,692. Halogensubstituted poly N vinyl carbazoles are described in published Japanese Patent Specifications 21,875 67, 25,230 67, 7,592 68, 19,751 67 and 7,591 68. Preferred compounds falling within the scope of class C are listed in Table 8.Table 8EMI17.1 EMI18.1 imidazolidine 4 on 2 thiones, e.g.EMI18.2 tetrahydro pyrimidine 2 thiones, e.g.EMI18.3 tetrahydro and dihydro oxazine 2 thiones and thiazine 2 thiones, e.g. EMI18.4 1 3 ,4 dihydro thiadiazine 2 thiones, e.g.EMI19.1 thiourea compounds including substituted derivatives preferably N phenyl thiourea compound, e.g. EMI19.2 thioamides, e.g.EMI19.3 Particularly useful hydrohalic acid acceptor compounds that by salt formation decrease the adherence of the photosensitive binder layer to the metal layer are basic dye precursor compounds,e.g. carbinol dye bases such asMichler s hydrol forming a triphenylmethane dye with hydrogen halide e.g. Howl. Other useful dye precursors forming a dye salt are 1,3,3 trimethylindolinobenzospiropyrans, and 1 , 3, 3 trimethylindolinonaphthospiropyrans as described in the United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,359,472. The ,ratio of binder to substance s capable of releasing C02 gas on exposure to actinic radiation may vary between wide limits and the most suitable ratio can easily be determined by running a series of tests. Generally the ratio by weight of binder to said C02 releasing substance s is comprised between 1 1 and 10 1. The same applies for the ratio of binder to the coWpoùd s capable of yielding halogen radicals.The compound s capable yielding halogen radicals which compound s may have binder properties, i.e. form the binder itself, is are used in admixture with at least one hydrogen donating substance in a ratio by weight which is comprised e.g. between 0.5 1 and 10 1.The above sensitizing agents that may act as substances enhancing the photoproduction of halogen radicals and or act as acid acceptor by salt formation with an halide acid are used with respect to the compound s producing halogen radicals in a ratio by weight between e.g.0.5 10 and 5 10. The support whereon the metal layer is applied is e.g. a resin support whereto the metal layer adheres less strongly than to the photosensitive layer in unexposed state. A particularly suited support for that purpose is a polyethylene terephthalate film support. In order to produce the present photosensitive recording material a metal coated base or support is coated with a solution of the above substances 1 and or 2 , together with a binder if 1 and 2 does not form the binder itself in a solvent thereof. After the coating the solvent s are removed by evaporation. The coating of the photosensitive binder layer may proceed by a known coating technique, e.g by spincoating, whirl coating ,spraying, dip coating, roller coating, air knife coating, doctor blade coating, etc. The thickness of the dried photosensitive recording layer is preferably in the range of 0.5 to 5 jim. The choice of the binding agent s i.e. the binder has to be such that the photosensitive layer in unexposed state adheres more strongly to the metal layer than the metal layer adheres to the support e.g. a polyethylene terephthalate support. A suitable binder for that purpose is the already mentioned SARAN F 220 trade mark and copolymers of vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate and maleic anhydride the major part 5o by weight of which is composed of vinyl chloride units. Other suitable binders in that respect are polycarbonates e.g. the polycarbonate of 2,2 4,41 dihy droxydipheny propane Bisphenol A . The metal layer which represents the visibly detectable imaging substance is preferably a smooth nonporous vacuum coated metal layer. Metals preferred for producing such layer are aluminium and nickel. The thickness of the metal layer is preferably in the range of 0.05 Fm to 0.50 jim. The adhesive material for effecting the peel apart processing may be any commercial pressure and or heat sensitive tape or sheet that adheres sufficiently well to the photosensitive binder layer to allow the peelapart of that binder layer together with the metal parts corresponding with the non photoexposed parts of that binder layer. A SCOTCH trade mark adhesive tape of MinnesotaMining and Mfg. Co 3M and TESA film I and IV being adhesive films comprising an adhesive layer on a clear hydrated cellulose base and polyvinyl chloride base respectively are particularly suitable. TESA is a trade mark of Beiersdorf AG, Desa Abt., Annastrasse 48, 2000 Hamburg, W.Germany. Another suited adhesive material for mounting photographs is known under the trade mark SELLOTAPE of Sellotape Products U.K. The photoexposure of the photosensitive layer may be an exposure through a contacting transparent master pattern e.g. graphic original,or a projection exposure.The present recording material is suitable for the reproduction of all kinds of text, line or screen image originals and may be used for making advertising panels and conductive circuits by dry peel apart processing. The exposure of the photosensitive binder layer may proceed through the adhesive tape or film e.g. in a contact exposure. Such requires that the adhesive tape or film is transparent to the actinic radiation used in the exposure. By actinic radiation is understood here any electromagnetic radiation that can effect the desired change in adherence power of the photosensitive binder layer. Particularly useful is ultraviolet radiation which is highly effective in the producing of photochenical decomposition reactions. Suitable radiation has therefore a wavelength of 250 400 nm Suitable radiation sources include carbon arcs, mercury vapour lamps, fluorescent lamps, argon glow lamps, photographic flood lamps and tungsten lamps.Moreover, ordinary daylight may also be used. Pulsed xenon lamps and tungsten lamps emitting to a minor amount in the ultraviolet region and mainly in the visible light range may likewise be used since some of the sensitizers such as the merocyanine dyes extend spectral absorption into the visible light range. The peel apart processing proceeds preferably at room temperature 200 C ,but it may be advantageous especially where C02 gas is produced in the photosensitive binder layer to effect the peel apart processing at elevated temperature e.g. between 500 and 100 C. The invention is illustrated by the following examples without, however, limiting it thereto. All ratios and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.Example n To a polyethylene terephthalate support carrying a vacuum coated aluminium layer with an optical density of 2.5 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 pm from a solution containing the following ingredients compound A of Table 1 0.2 g SARAN F 220 trade mark 1 g acetone 8 ml 1 2 dichloroethane 2 ml methyl ethyl ketone 10 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape known under the name SELLOTAPE trade mark was laminated on the photosensitive layer.The photosensitive layer was exposed for 30 s through the adhesive tape in contact with a graphic art text negative serving as original by means of a SPEKTRA PR0OF trade mark apparatus containing a high pressure mercury vapour lamp of 2000 W doped with iron III chloride. SPEKTRA PRO0F is a Trade Mark of Siegfried TheimerGmbH, 6484 Birstein, Obersotzbach, Federal Republic ofGermany. Thereupon the laminate was dipped into water of 700C for 1 min and the adhesive tape subsequently peeled apart. At the exposed parts the aluminium coating remained at the polyethylene terephthalate support, whereas at the unexposed parts the aluminium adhering to the photosensitive layer was torn off and formed thereon an aluminium image having the same image values with respect to the original. On the support an aluminium image remained having reversed image values with respect to the original so that the negative original yielded here a positive copy.Example 2 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 Fm from a solution containing the following ingredients compound A of Table 1 0.3 g SARAN F 220 trade mark 1 g methyl ethyl ketone 11 ml 1, 2 dichloroethane 2 ml After drying at 8000 for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape as described in Example 1 was laminated on the photosensitive layer. The image wise exposure of the photosensitive layer proceeded as described in Example 1 but lasted only 20 s.Thereupon the laminate was dipped into water of 7000 for 45 s and the adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart subsequently. A same result as described in Example 1 was obtained.Example 3 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 Mm from a solution containing the following ingredients compound 2 of Table 2 0.025 g SARAN B 220 trade mark 1 g acetone 8 ml 1,2 dichloroethane 2 ml methyl ethyl ketone 10 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape as described in Example 1 was laminated on the photosensitive layer. The image wise exposure of the photosensitive layer proceeded as described in Example 1. Thereupon the adhesive tape was peeled apart at room temperature 2000 . A same result as described in Example 1 was obtained.By peeling apart the laminate after heat treatment at 7000 for 10 s it was possible to reduce the time of the photoexposure to 10 s without impairing the image result.Example 4 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 pm from a solution containing the following ingredients 4,4 bis dimethylamino benzhydrol 0.025 g SARAN F 220 trade mark 1 g methyl ethyl ketone 18 ml 1,2 dichloroethane 2 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape as described in Example 1 was laminated on the photosensitive layer. The image wise exposure of the photosensitive layer proceeded as described in Example 1 but lasted only 20 s. Thereupon the laminate was dipped into water of 700C for 1 min and the adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart subsequently. A same result as described in Example 1 was obtained.Example 5 To a solution of 1 g of SARAN F 220 trade mark in 16 ml of methyl ethyl ketone and 4 ml of 1,2 dichloroethane different amounts of compound 19 of Table 6 were added,. The different coating solutions were applied separately at a wet coating thickness of 50 pm to the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1. The obtained samples were dried at 800C for 5 min and an adhesive tape as described in Example 1 laminated thereon.

The dried photosensitive layer was exposed for 3 s through an original by means of an exposure apparatus as described in Example 1. After the image wise photoexposure an adhesive tape as defined in Example 1 was laminated to the photosensitive layer. The adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart at room temperature. A negative aluminium image was obtained on the support and a positive aluminium image on the photosensitive layer that was peeled apart with the tape. Example 8 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 pm from a solution containing the following ingredients compound 8 of Table 4 0.01 g SARAN F 220 trade mark 1 g methyl ethyl ketone 10 ml acetone 8 ml 1,2 dichloroethane 2 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape as described in Example 1 was laminated on the photosensitive layer. The image wise exposure of the photosensitive layer proceeded as described in Example 1 but lasted 45 s. After the exposure the adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart at room temperature. A same image result as described in Example 1 was obtained.Example 9 Example 8 was repeated with the difference, however, that 0.01 g of compound 8 of Table 4 was replaced by 0.1 g of 4 methoxy naphthol. The image wise photoexposure proceeded as in Example 1 but lasted only 10 s.The laminating and stripping peeling apart proceeded likewise as described in Example 1 and offered an analogous result.Example 10 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 iim from a solution containing the following ingredients carbon tetrabromide 0.2 g compound 20 of Table 6 0.1 g copolymer of vinyl chloride vinyl acetate maleic anhydride 86 13 1 weight 1 g methyl ethyl ketone 26 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min a transparent adhesive tape as described in Example 1 was laminated on the photosensitive layer. The image wise exposure of the photosensitive layer proceeded as described inExample 1. After the exposure the adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart at room temperature. A same image result as described in Example 1 was obtained.Example 11 To the aluminium layer of the support of Example 1 a photosensitive layer was applied at a wet coating thickness of 50 jim from a solution containing the following ingredients carbon tetrabromide 0.1 g compound 20 of Table 6 0.05 g polycarbonate of 2,2 4,4 dihydroxy phenyl propane 0.5 g 1,2 dichloroethane 13 ml After drying at 800C for 5 min the photosensitive layer was image wise exposed as described in Example 7. After the image wise photoexposure an adhesive tape as defined in Example 1 was laminated to the photosensitive layer. The adhesive tape overall adhering to the photosensitive layer was peeled apart at room temperature.A negative aluminium image was obtained on the support and a positive image on the photosensitive layer peeled apart with the tape.Example 12 Example 11 was repeated with the difference, however, that compound 20 of Table 6 was replaced by the same amount of 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl spiro 2H 1 benzopzran 2,2 indolinej.
