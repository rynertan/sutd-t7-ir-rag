# Preparation of granular stereoregular butene 1 polymers in a fluidized bed.

## Abstract
Granular stereoregular butene 1 polymers having a high isotactic content, and an extractables content of no more than about 15 weight percent in boiling ethyl ether, are produced over a continuous extended period of time in a low pressure gas phase fluidized bed process, in the absence of liquid dilu ent components, with a stereospecific olefin polymerization catalyst under a selected set of operating conditions.
