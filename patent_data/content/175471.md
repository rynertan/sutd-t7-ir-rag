# Ostomy appliance.

## Abstract
An ostomy appliance having two interengaging coupling elements is described. One of the elements is an annular plate which includes an engaging member formed by two ribs which diverge from each other to define a V formation. One of the ribs has a stepped formation on its distal region. The other coupling element has an annular channel having cooperating formation adapted to engage the stepped formation, thereby connecting the coupling elements.
