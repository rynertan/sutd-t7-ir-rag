# Zirconia Porcelain and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a zirconia porcelain comprises 1.5 5 mol of yttrium oxide, 1 5.5 mol of cerium oxide and the balance being substantially zirconium oxide. Disclosed he rein also is a method of producing a zirconia porcelain, which comprises steps of preparing a mixed powder comprising 1.5 5 mol of yttrium oxide, 1 5.5 mol of cerium oxide and the balance being mainly zirconium oxide and having the average particle size of less than 1.5 Âµm when measured according to an air permeation method, shaping the mixed powder into a molding, and firing the molding thus obtained at 1,100 C 1,700 C. The use of both yttrium oxide and cerium oxide in the amounts specified provides considerable ther mal stability and long term resistance to deterioration.
