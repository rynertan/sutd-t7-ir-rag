## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION l OXADETHIACEPHALOSPORIN COMPOUND AND ANTIBACTERIALAGENT CONTAINING THE SAME.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a new l oxadethiacephalosporin compound. We, the present inventors, have made extensive researches in an attempt to seek for such l oxadethiacephalosporin compounds which exhibit a wide range of antibacterial spectrum and which are active against a wide variety of resistant bacteria, and we have now synthesized new l oxadethiacephalosporins by introducing different substituents on l oxadethiacephalosporin nucleus at 7 and 3 positions thereof. On examination of antibacterial properties of these new compounds, we have found that these new compounds now synthesized have a wide range of antibacterial activities and also exhibit a highly curative effect in therapeutic treatment of bacterial infection even upon oral administration of the new compound, so that we have accomplished this invention. According to a first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided a l oxadethiacephalosporin compound of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R2 is a group of the formula EMI2.2 in which R3 is a hydrogen atom or carboxyl group, or a group of the formula EMI2.3 in which R4 is a hydrogen atom or amino group, andR5 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a group of the formula EMI2.4 where R6 and R7 may be the same or different and each is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a non toxic salt or non toxic ester of said compound.

Moreover, this invention also includes a solvate, particularly hydrate of the cephalosporin compound I within the claimed scope. Besides, this invention covers a non toxic salt and a non toxic ester of the cephalosporin compound I , in particular a metabolically unstable ester thereof. By the term non toxic is meant Pharmaceutically acceptable . As compound analogous to the compound of the general formula I according to this invention, there are mentioned ceftazidime and its related compounds which are shown in Japanese patent application prepublication tKokai No. 154786 79 specification.Ceftazidime and its related compounds are of such type in which some of the side chain group at the 7 position of the cephem nucleus are similar to that of the new compound I of this invention, but they are containing such substituents at the 3 position thereof which are evidently different in nature from that of the new compound of this invention. Thus, t,he substituent at the 3 position of ceftazidime is pyridiniummethyl group, whereas the substituent at the 3 position of the new compound I of this invention is a lower alkylthio group. Besides, the abovementioned Japanese patent application prepublication does nowhere disclose that the particular compounds exemplified therein can be administered orally.In contrast, the new compound of this invention, owing to the particular combination of the specified substituents existing at the 7 and 3 positions thereof, exhibits an improved property that it can be administered not only parenterally but also orally to achieve a therapeutic effect on the bacterial infections. Furthermore, the new compound of this invention has been found to exhibit some advantages that it shows a wider range and a higher level of antibacterial activity as well as a very much enhanced curative effect in the therapeutic treatment of bacterial infection, as compared to cephalexin, cephatriazine, cefaclor, cefroxadine and the like which are representative of orally administrable antibacterial agent of cephalosporin series, commercially available at present. For instance, some compounds which are representative of the new compound I of this invention have the following advantages as compared to cefroxadine.Thus, a As will be clear from Table 1 given below which shows antibacterial spectra of the test compounds against a variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria as determined in vitro in terms of the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC. of the test compounds against the various bacteria, the Example l b compound, Example 2 b compound,Example 3 b compound and Example 4 b compound identified later as representative examples of the new compound I of this invention can exhibit a wider range of the antibacterial spectrum than cefroxadine and also exhibit an effective and higher antibacterial activity against resistant strains of bacteria than cefroxadine. That is to say, the compound of this invention exhibits not only a practically effective antibacterial activity againstStaphylococcus aureus as one of gram positive bacteria but also exhibits a higher antibacterial activity against a wide variety of gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis,Proteus morganii, Serratia marcescens, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa etc. TABLE 1Minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC. mcg ml as determined by serial dilution method on agar plates Example 1 b Example 2 b Exampel 3 b Example 4 b Example 6 b compound of compound of compound of compound of compound of this this this this this CefroxadineTest Organisms invention invention invention invention invention comparative Staphylococcus 0.20 0.10 0.39 3.13 1.56 aureus SmithStaphylococcus 0.20 0.05 0.20 1.56 1.56 aureus 209P 3C 1Escherichia coli 6.25 6.25 0.78 0.78 3.13NIHJ JC 2Klebsiella 1.56 1.56 0.39 0.10 3.13 pneumoniae PCI 602Proteus mirbilis 25 25 1.56 0.39 50GN 79Salmonella 1.56 1.56 0.20 0.05 6.25 typhimurium LT 2Proteus vulgaris 100 50 50 100 100GN 76Protues rettgeri 100 3.13 1.56 3.13 100GN 624Serratia 100 3.13 0.39 0.78 100 marcescens No. 2 b The new compound of this invention is highly effective in therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections in vivo even when it is administered orally. Thus, some tests were made to evaluate the curative effects of the new compound of this invention in therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections when the new compound was orally given to mice average body weight 20 g which had been infected with Escherichia coli No. 29. In these tests for therapeutic treatment of the bacterial infection, mice three mice in each group were inoculated intraperitoneally with Escherichia coli No. 29 at an inoculum 5 dose of 3.25 x 105 CFU mouse and then immediately treated by oral administration of the test compound.For the subsequent 7 days, the mice were kept under observation and the number of surviving mice was counted. The test results obtained are shown inTable 2 below. For instance, the Example 6 b compound which was tested as an example of the new compound of this invention exhibited better curative effects in therapeutic treatment of the bacterial infection in vivo.

According to a further aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided an antibacterial agent which comprises at least one of the l oxadethiacephalosporln compound represented by the aforesaid general formula I , and a non toxic salt or non toxic ester of said compound as the active ingredient. The non toxic salt, that is, pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of the general formula I includes conventional non toxic salts carboxylates as formed by reaction with the carboxylic group present in the compound, particularly salts with inorganic bases, for example, alkali metal salts such as sodium salt and potassium salt alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and zinc salt and addition salts with such basic amino acids as lysine, arginine, ornithine and histidine, as well as addition salt with organic amine salt or other basic salts which usually will form a salt with cephalosporin. Other non toxic salts of the compound I of this invention include those which may be formed by adding to the amino group or another basic group of said compound an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid, an inorganic carboxylic or súlfonic acid such as trifluoroacetic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, maleic, tartaric or p toluenesulfonic acid or an acidic amino acid such as aspartic or glutamic acid, and further they may include intermolecular or intramolecular salts. The non toxic esters of the compound I of this invention are those esters of the carboxyl group present in said compound with pharmaceutically acceptable ester forming groups. Among these are preferred metabolically unstable ester, which carry an ester forming group cleavable upon hydrolysis in vivo.

For use as antibacterial agent, the compound of this invention may be given orally or parenterally to adults at a unit dosage of 50 1500 mg and preferably of 100 1000 mg four to six times per day when it is administered for therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections in man. The antibacterial agent according to this invention may usually be composed of the compound of this invention in association with a solid or liquid excipient, and it may be formulated into solid preparations such as tablets, capsules, powder and pre treated powder, or into liquid preparations such as injectable solution or suspension and syrup. Solid or liquid excipient used for this purpose may be any one known in this field of the art.As stated above, the preparations so formed may preferably contain the compound of this invention at an amount required for the unit dosage of the compound for adult indicated above. The new l oxadethiacephalosporin compound of the formula I according to this invention may be produced, for example, by any of the following processes l and 2 . Process 1 l Oxadethia 3 alkylthio 7 amino cephem compound of the formula EMI11.1 in which R1 is as defined above and R8 represents a hydrogen atom or a known carboxyl protecting group, is reacted with a thienyl compound of the formula EMI11.2 wherein Rg represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally protected carboxyl group and COR10 represents a carboxyl group or a reactive derivative thereof to effect the acylation reaction on the 7 amino group of the compound II , and the carboxyl protecting group R8, etc. is then removed optionally from the resulting 7 N acylated product to give the desired compound of the formula I .Process 2 l Oxadethia 3 alkylthio 7 amino cephem compound of the above formula II is reacted with a thiazolyl compound of the formula EMI11.3 wherein R11 represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally protected amino group and Rl2 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an optionally protected carboxylalkyl group, in the syn isomeric configuration or a reactive derivative of the carboxyl group of the compound IV to effect the acylation reaction of the 7 amino group of the compound II , and the carboxyl and amino protecting groups are removed, if desired, from the resulting 7 N acylated product to give the final compound of the formula I . The above process l or 2 may be carried out by employing the conventional reaction known per se in synthesis of an amide. The carboxyl protecting groups which may be used to protect the carboxyl group of the compounds of the formulae II , III or IV include p nitrobenzyl, diphenylmethyl, tertbutyl, trimethylsilyl, bisdimethylsilyl, trimethoxysilyl, bisdimethoxysilyl group and the like. Removal of the carboxyl protecting group from the acylation product may be carried out in a conventional manner known to remove the carboxyl protecting group.Appropriate reactive derivatives of the carboxyl group of the compound III or its may include an acid halide, an acid anhydride, an active amide, an active ester and the like.

The acylation reaction using the compound III or IV in the form of a free acid or its reactive derivative to provide an amide is preferably conducted in an anhydrous reaction medium such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetonitrile. If desired, the acylation reaction is performed in the presence of a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine. Further, a known amino protecting group which is usually used in the conventional synthesis of penicillin or cephalosporin compounds may be used to protect the amino group of the thiazolyl compound IV , and such the known amino protecting group may be removed from the protected amino group of the acylation product subsequent to the acylation reaction.Typical example of the amino protecting groups which may be used includes trityl group, an aralkyloxycarbonyl group such as benzyloxycarbonyl and p methoxy benzyloxycarbonyl an alkoxycarbonyl group such as trichloroethoxycarbonyl and t butoxycarbonyl an alkanoyl group such as chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl, trifluoroacetyl and formyl phthaloyl benzoyl group substituted with a halogen, nitro or lower alkyl or I to 4 carbon atoms and the like.
