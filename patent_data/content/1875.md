## Description
1. Field of the Invention The present invention is useful in bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other, for example, in construction, automotive applications, plastic fabricating, packaging, structural foam bonding, assembly of toys, etc The process described herein is effective for bonding low energy plastic surfaces having a critical surface tension of about 24 to about 37 dynes per centimeter to each other which comprises A heating said surfaces that will be bonded to each other to a temperature of at least 500C, B applying an adhesive composition effective in bonding low energy plastic surfaces to each other to at least one of said surfaces, said adhesive composition comprising 1 an ethylene vinyl ester copolymer having from about 4 to about 50 weight percent of a vinyl ester 2 a tackifier and 3 a wax, and wherein said adhesive composition is in a temperature range of about 90 to about 2500C at the time of application and then C bringing said surfaces in contact with each other.2. Description of the Prior Art Ordinarily, adhesive bonding of low energy plastic surfaces to each other requires some form of surface treatment prior to application of an adhesive to obtain high bond strengths between the surfaces so contacted. Low energy plastic surface s bonded to each other without prior surface treatment, such as by relatively weak, tacky adhesives, are inadequate for many purposes. For strong bonds involving low energy plastic surfaces some form of surface treatment or etching is required prior to application of an adhesive Surface pretreatment of lowenergy plastic surfaces, for example, involves either acid etching with sulfuric, nitric, chromic acids or mixtures thereof, or flame treatment, corona discharge treatment, treatment with plasma jets or low and high energy radiation. Consequently, a need exists for a much simpler process for bonding low energy plastic surfaces, In accordance with the present invention a novel hot melt adhesive composltion process is provided which requires minimal heating of the surfaces to be bonded together and maximum bond strength in a matter of minutes or a few hours without resort to elaborate post curing procedures. Further,the process of the present invention provides rapid assembly of components and immediate handling of the assembled parts. Another advantage of the present invention is that the bonds so formed can deliver improved tensile lap shear strengths. Applicant is unaware of any prior art relevant to the invention defined and claimed herein. I have discovered a unique process effective for bonding low energy plastic surfaces having a critical surface tension of about 24 to about 37 dynes per centimeter to each other which comprises A heating said surfaces that will be bonded to each other to a temperature of at least 500C, B applying an adhesive composition effective in bonding lowenergy plastic surfaces to each other to at least one of said surfaces, said adhesive composition comprising 1 an ethylene vinyl ester copolymer having from about 4 to about 50 weight percent of a vinyl ester 2 a tackifier and 3 a wax, and wherein said adhesive composition is in a temperature range of about 90 to about 2500C at the time of application and then C bringing said surfaces in contact with each other. The process of the present invention is a hot melt adhesive bonding process for specific adhesive compositions and surfaces, that is, low energy plastic surfaces, which can include, for example, polyolefins and or modified polyolefins, especially polyethylene and polypropylene. For purposes of the present invention a low energy plastic surface is defined as one which has a critical surface tension y c of between about 24 to about 37 dynes cm mN m . For example, polyethylene ranges from about 25.5 to about 36 dynes cm, and polypropylene ranges from about 24 te about 34 dynes cm. The process for bonding low energy plastic surfaces involves heating said surfaces which are to be bonded to each other to a temperature of at least about 500C, preferably about 60 to about 1300C, followed by an application of the adhesive composition of the present invention, while the adhesive composition is in a temperature range of about 90 to about 2500C, preferably about 120 to about 2200C to at least one of the surfaces. Then the surfaces are brought in contact with each other After assembly the bond reaches a maximum tensile strength in a matter of minutes or few hours.No post curing is required and therefore, rapid assembly and handling of assembled parts is possible. Adhesive compositions which are employed with the proce of the present invention contain one or more specific ethylene vinyl ester copolymers, a tackifier, cnd a wax. Ethylene vinyl ester copolymers that can be used herein include vinyl esters having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms.Examples of suitable ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl formate, ethylenevinyl propionate, ethylene vinyl butyate and mixtures thereof. The copolymer can contain from about 4 to about 50 weight percent, preferably about 5 to about 40 weight percent, of a vinyl ester, and can have a melt index as measured by ASTM 1238 52T of about 0.5 to about 500, preferably 200 to about 400. These copolymers can be prepared by any method generally employed in the art, for example, preparation such as that taught in U.S. Patent Nos.2,200,429 to Perrin et al and 2,703,794 to Roedel. In the present invention blends, or mixtures, of ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are sometimes used to obtain a melt index within the desired range.For example, if blends or mixtures of ethylene vinyl ester copolymers are employed, individual ethylene vinyl ester copolymers can be used even if they do not have the melt index defined above, provided the resulting mixture has a melt index within the defined range. As contemplated in the present invention any tackifier known in the art can be employed herein. Particularly, suitable tackifiers, for example, can be selected from the group consisting of a a rosin, b a rosin ester, c a terpene resin, d a terpene phenolic resin, e p. rosinmodified phenolic resin and f a petroleum resin Tackifiers which are present in the adhesive composition serve to extend the adhesive properties of the ethylene vinyl ester copolymer Tackifiers for use in the present invention have a softening point in the range of about 40 to about l500C, preferably about 65 to about 1350C. Small amounts of tackifiers having a softening point of less than 400C, or higher than 1500C, can be mixed or blended with tackifiers in the desired range to give desirable results however, tackifier blends having a tackifier with a softening point of less than 40 C and higher than 1500C are not preferred in the invention as set forth Examples of rosins and rosin esters in the hot melt system include both natural and modified rosins, such as, for example, gum rosin, wood rosin, tall oil rosin, distilled rosin, hydrogenated rosin, dimerized rosin, disproportionated rosin and polymerized rosin glycerine and pen taerytiiritol esters of rosin, including stabilized, hydrogenated, polymerized, disproportionated, dimerized and unmodified rosin. Terpene resins sometimes called polyterpene resins, result from polymerization of terpene hydrocarbons, such as bicyclic monoterpene known as pinene, in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst at moderately low temperatures. Terpene resins effective for the adhesive composition have a softening point as measured by ASTM E28 58T of from about 40 to about 1350 C. Another example of a suitable terpene resin isa polymerized beta pinene. Terpene phenolic resins can include, for example, the product resulting from the condensation of bicyclic terpene, in an acidic medium and or terpene alcohol with phenol Rosin modified phenolic resins can include, for example, the reaction products of rosin with phenol formaldehyde condensate Petroleum resins can include, for example, low molecular weight polymers and copolymers of styrene and vinyl toluene Rosin and rosin esters can be prepared, for example, according to the methods described in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology,Interscience Publishers, a Division of John Wiley Sons New York 1964 , Volume 12, pp. 139 164 terpene resins can be prepared, for example. according to the methods described in Volume 13, pp. 575 596 of the same publication.Terpene phenolic resins and rosin modified phenolic resins can be prepared, for example, according to the methods described in Organic Coating Technology, H.F Payne, John Wiley Sons New York 1954 , Volume 1, pp. 183 184 and 168 170, respectively Petroleum resins can be prepared, for example, according to methods described in the Encyclopedia of PolymerScience and Technology, Interscience Publishers, a Division of John Wiley Sons New York 1968 , Volume 9 pp. 853 860. The adhesive composition fdr use in the present invention also contains a wax. Any suitable wax, natural or synthetic, can be employed. These can include, for example, paraffinic wax, scale wax, ozokerite, Utah wax, microcrystalline wax such as plastic and tank bottom derived microcrystalline waxes, a synthetic wax such as Fisher Tropsch wax, polyethylene, both low and high density polyethylenes, and blends thereof. The preferred waxes can include petroleum derived waxes such as, for example. microcrystalline waxes and paraffin waxes intermediate waxes which are hybrid materials derived from heavy waxy distillates and having physical and functional properties intermediate to those of fully refined paraffin waxes,and microcrystalline waxes and polyethylene.Microcrystalline waxes can include, for example, branchedchain hydrocalbonc and alkylcycloaliphatic naphthenic nyazcoarbonsì as well as strsight chair hydrocarbons whose molecular weight range is from about 400 to about 800, as defined, for example, in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Interscience Publishers, a Division of JohnWiley New York 1971 Vol. 14, pp. 770 771 Intermediate waxes are characterized by a melting point of about 150 to about 1600F 65.50C to about 71.10C as measured by ASTM D87 a viscosity, SUS at 210 F of about 51.7 and a molecular weight of about 500 to about 650.Suitable polyethylene in the present invention has an average molecular weight of about 600 to about 40,000, preferably about 600 to about 3000, and most preferably about 900 to about 2500 Polyethylenes useful as waxes in the present invention can be linear or branched, preferably linear, that is at least 70 percent of the molecules are linear or paraffinic preferably at least 90 percent are linear. The n paraffin or n alkane content of hydrocarbon waxes can be determined by molecular sieve adsorption or by urea adduction The penetration or hardness of the wax at 250C is about 0.25 to about 1.5, preferably about 0 75 to about 1.00 as determined by ASTM D 1321 The density at 250C of the polyethylene wax employed in the present invention is about 0.93 to about 0.97, preferably about 0 94 to about 0.96.Each of the enumerated parameters are interrelated as is readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Polyethylene waxes can be obtained, for example, by the low pressure pol,ymerization of ethylene usingZiegler catalysts. An especially preferred adhesive composition is disclosed and claimed in my copending application Serial No.filed concurrently herewith, entitled Adhesive Composition and Process for Bonding If desired, other components generally added to an adhesive composition for a particular purpose can also be present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 5, preferably about 0.2 to about 2, weight percent based on the weight of the final composition. An example of such an additive can include an antioxidant such as 1, 3, 5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 ditertiarybutyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene. In general, adhesive compositions which can be employed in the invention defined and claimed herein can have the following components in the following amounts as set forth in Table 1. Table 1 Adhesive Composition Broad Range Preferred Range wt wt Ethylene Vinyl Ester Copolymer 15 to 55 25 to 55Tackifier 25 to 45 25 to 40Wax 5 to 60 10 to 50 The adhesive composition can be prepared in any conventional manner. Thus, for example, a preferred procedure involves the use of a so called melt mixing technique in which the wax diluent together with an antioxidant, if used, is maintained in a stirred molten state at a temperature between about 130 to about 2300C, preferably between about 140 to about 1700C, during which time the tackifier is added followed by the addition of the ethylene vinyl ester copolymer. Mixing is continued until a homogeneous mixture is obtained, approximately after about 15 minutes to about 4 hours. The invention will be further described with reference to the experimental data. Adhesive compositions were prepared as follows. A wax, in an amount sufficient to make a 200.4 gram batch of adhesive, was mixed with an antioxidant, 1,3,5 trimethyl2,4,6 tris 3,5 ditertiarybutyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene was used in all experiments herein. The wax antioxidant mixture was placed in a jacketed 400 ml capacity Brabender Plasticorder and kept host by an oil bath heated to approximately 145 to about 1550C. At a slow, 50 rpm blade setting, the wax antioxidant mixture was melted and then the tackifier was added while mixing continued. Continued mixing produced a fluid wax antioxidant tackifier mixture. An ethylene vinyl ester copolymer was added to the fluid wax antioxidanttackifier mixture in the order of high melt index copolymer followed by low melt index copolymer. Mixing was continued at a top speed setting of the blades at approximately 150 rpm for approximately 10 to about 15 minutes until homogeneity occurred, and then the speed was decreased to 100 rpm and the composition was mixed for approximately 5 minutes. On completion of mixing, the torque generally levelled off, and the adhesive composition was ready to be poured. Total mixing time was about 15 to about 20 minutes. Low energy plastic test speciments were prepared in accordance with the following procedure. Test strips having a dimension of 1 x 3 x 1 8 inch 2.54 x 7.5 x 0.31 cm or 1 x 3 x 3 16 in. 2.54 x 7.5 x 0.45 cm were used in the preparation of tensile lap shear strength test specimens.The strips were cleaned with acetone rinse and wiped dry. The test strips two for each test specimen were then exposed to an infra red lamp t9 heat the surface to between about 80 to about 100 C. Molten adhesive at temperatures between about 176 to about 1900C was applied as a 1 8 inch 2 0.31 cm bead over a square inch 6.45 cm area on one of the test strips. A lap shear strength specimen was prepared immediately following application of the adhesive composition by quickly placing another strip over the adhesive with the heated side of the strip on the adhesive 2 to provide a square inch 6.45 cm lap. Manual pressure was used to spread the adhesive over the bonded area.A 500gram weight was then placed on the bonded area and left for about 5 minutes, to maintain contact of the surfaces during initial cooling, after which it was removed. The specimen was cooled to 230C and excess adhesive was removed. The specimen was stored overnight prior to testing. At least two specimens were prepared for each evaluation and the values reported as an average of the two for a given test run. The method used for testing the adhesive bond strength was the tensile lap shear method with modifications as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,393,175 at columns 2 through 3.The values for lap shear were measured by determining on anInstron the force required to break the bond. As a modification employed herein, the rate of extension was 2 inches 5 cm per minute. The force divided by the area of the bond gives the lap shear in pounds per square inch. A series of runs was carried out using the compositions set forth in the upper portion of Table 2 to demonstrate the effect of surface temperature on bond strength of various adhesive compositions as determined by tensile lap shear strength.
