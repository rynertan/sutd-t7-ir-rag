# Light weight silicate aggregate.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of an expanded water insoluble silicate aggregate is disclosed in this pro cess, anhydrous alkali metal silicate is hydrated, in the pres ence of a curing agent, and then subjected to rapid thermal expansion. The process eliminates the use of liquid silicates and the reaction is conducted in an essentially dry state. The expanded product has extremely low bulk density.
