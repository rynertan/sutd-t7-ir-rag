The compounds of formula I may be prepared in analogous manner to the compounds of formula A . The invention thus provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises reacting an acid of the formula XXIX EMI23.1 wherein R1 is as defined and R2Ú, R11Ú and R12Ú areR2, R11 and R12 as defined but when R1 is C 1 6 alkoxy the third of them may be C 1 6 alkylthio or a reactive derivative thereof, with a compound of formula XXX .EMI23.2 wherein R6 is as defined in formula I , the remaining variable groups being as defined in formula I and thereafter if necessary converting a groupR2Ú, R11Ú or R12Ú in the thus formed compound to another group R2, R11 or R12 respectively converting R6 to another R6 and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of the formula I . Reactive derivative when used herein means a derivative of the compound XIX which can be reacted with the compound XXX to form an amido linkage between the acid group of the compound XIX and the amino group of the compound of the formula XXX . Often this reactive derivative will be the acid halide, such as the acid chloride, of the acid XXIX .In such cases, the reaction will normally be carried out in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. The inert solvent can be any solvent inert to both reactants, such as benzene, toluene, diethyl ether or dichloromethane. The acid acceptor is suitably an organic base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, or an inorganic acid acceptor, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the like. It should also be noted that it is possible to use certain acid acceptors as the inert solvent, for example organic bases. These reactions may be carried out at any non extreme temperature such as 100 1000C and more suitably 00 800C.The higher reaction temperatures are employed with less active acids of the formula XXIX whereas the lower temperatures are employed with the more reactive acids of the formula XXX . Another useful reactive derivative of the acid XXIX is a highly activated ester wuch as the pentacillorophenyl ester, when ambient temperatures may be used. The reaction is generally effected in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. The reaction may also be carried out by forming an anhydride of the acid XXIX in the usual manner, and reacting that with the compound XXX normally a conventional mixed anhydride will be used or by reacting the acid XXIX and the compound XXX in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The intermediates of the formulae XXIX and XXX are either known compounds or can be prepared by analogous processes to known compounds. It will be realised that in the compound of the formula I the CO NR5 CH2 n linkage may have an a or ss orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to which it is attached. A mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the a or ss isomer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding a or ss form of the compound of the formula XXX . Synthesis from the corresponding a or ss isomer of the compound of the formula XXX is in general preferred. The a or ss form of the compound of the formula XVIII may if desired be prepared by known stereospecific processes, such as those leading to the a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula XXX depicted in the Scheme and described in Descriptions 3C, 4A and 4C of European PatentApplication No. 79302978.6 and allowed U.S. PatentApplication No. 107,413 for the a isomers and Descriptions 2 and 3A and B of these Applications for the isomers. The precursor of the compound of the formula XXX may be stereospecifically synthesised, such as the azide D3 of Description 2 of the above European and U.S.Applications and then converted to the corresponding desired isomer of the compound of the formula XXX under non stereospecific conditions with retention of configuration. Alternatively, the precursor may itself have no pro chiral centre at the relevant position, such as the oximes and imines of Descriptions 3 and 4 of the aboveEuropean and U.S. Applications but be converted under stereospecific conditions to the desired isomer of the compound of the formula XXX . Alternatively, a mixture of the a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula XXX may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom e.g. by chromatography. However, in this case it is generally more convenient to react the mixture to give a mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I and to separate these if desired as hereinbefore described. The following Scheme 1 illustrates stereo specific and non stereospecific synthetic routes to intermediates of the formula XXX wherein n is 0. Scheme l EMI27.1 Remainder of ring system omitted for clarity The following Scheme 2 illustrates preparative routes to intermediates of the formula XXX wherein n is 1 or 2. EMI28.1 The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such salts, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compoundR9Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide and the like, at ambient or raised temperature and pressure. The nitrogen atom of the moiety of formula IV may also form an N oxide to give an internal N oxide salt of the compound of the formula I . The N oxides may be prepared in conventional manner such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with an organic per acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. This reaction is suitably carried out at below ambient temperature in an organic solvent. It will be apparent that the product of the reaction of the compounds of formulae XXIX and XXX will be of formula XXXI EMI29.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formulae XXIX and XXX . Compounds of the formula XXXI containing an R1 R11Ú or R12Ú group convertile to R2, R11 or R12 are useful intermediates and as such form an important aspect of the invention. Some compounds of the formula XXXI will also fall within formula I . Compounds of the formula I containing an R2, R11, R12 or R6 group which is convertible to another corresponding group are also useful intermediates and as such form an important aspect of the invention. By way of example of such conversions, the conversion of a R11 nitro group to an R11 amino group may be achieved in conventional manner such as by reduction. Thus an optional process step provided by this invention in the preparation of the compounds of the formula I substituted by an amino group comprises the reduction of a corresponding intermediate of formula correspondingly substituted by a nitro group. The reduction of the intermediates containing a nitro group may be effected with reagents known to be suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole. A suitable reagent for this reduction is stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid or in mixtures of hydrochloric and acetic acid. The desired amino compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by neutralisation followed by extraction into a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate from which it may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. Another suitable method is catalytic hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure in polar solvent such as ethanol.Transition metal catalysts such as Raney nickel are often used, The desired compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by filtration and evaporation to dryness. The initial crude product in both cases may be purified by chromatography or crystallisation or by forming an acid addition salt which may be recrystallised. In general however, it is more convenient to prepare a compound of the formula I containing an amino group from the corresponding C17 acylamino acid or its reactive derivative, and to deacylate the compound of the formula I so formed. Those compounds of the invention substituted by a C17 acylamino grdup may be prepared from the corresponding intermediate containing an amino group by reaction with an acylating derivative, such as previously described as a suitable acylating derivativeThe reaction may proceed as described for the reaction of the compounds of the formula. For a formamido group acylation may be effected with the free acid. This invention thus also provides an optional process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I substituted by an amino group which process comprises the deacylation of a corresponding compound of formula I correspondingly substituted by a C17 acylamino group. Generally the hydrolysis reaction may be effected by treatment with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide. Although as noted R11 may be nitro, it is generally preferred that R11 is a R11 group other than nitro. R6 optionally substituted benzyl groups may be removed by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula XXXII EMI32.1 wherein the variable groups are as defined in formulae and the compound of formula XXXII converted into one of formula I with a different R6. This invention also provides an optional process step in the preparation of a compound of the formula I which comprises the reaction of a corresponding compound of the formula XXXII as hereinbefore defined with a compound QR6 wherein R6 is as defined in formula I and Q is a group or atom readily displaced by a nucleophile, converting R 2 R1 11 and R112 to R2 R11 and R12 respectively and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or N oxide of the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable values for Q include C1, Br, I, OSO2CH3 orOS02C6H4pCH3. Favoured values for Q include C1, Br and I. Particularly suitably the compound QR6 is a benzyl halide such as benzyl bromide or benzyl chloride. The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at a non extreme temperature such as at ambient or at a slightly elevated temperature. However, it is generally more convenient to interconvert R6 in the compound of the formula XXX before coupling with the compound of the formula XXIX or its derivative. Such interconversions are effected conveniently under the above conditions. It is desirable to protect the amine function with a group readily removable by acidolysis such as a C27 alkanoyl group before R6 interconversion. R1 12 C 1 6 alkylthio may be converted to R12 as defined. An alternative process according to the present invention thus comprises oxidising a compound of the formula XXXII as hereinbefore defined wherein R1 is C16 alkoxy and one of R 2 R1111 or R 12 is C16 alkylthio and 1 1 1 thereafter if necessary converting a group R2 , R 11 R 12 or R6 in the thus formed compound to a group R2, R11, R12 or R6 as hereinbefore defined and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of the formula I , or N oxide therof. These oxidations may conveniently be carried out conventioanlly at below ambient temperatures using a strichiometric amount of an organic peracid in a non aqueous inert reaction medium preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, for example using peracetic acid, or using an inorganic oxidant,. such as chromium trioxide in acetic acid. It will be appreciated by the skilled man that, depending on the other specific substituents in the compound of the formula I , such an oxidation on a compound of the formula I may also form the N oxide of the bicyclic moiety therein. Given the specific substitution desired and having been decided whether the compound or its N oxide is required, the skilled man will readily ascertain whether such interconversion is desirable. In general however it is more convenient to prepare a compound of formula I from the corresponding C16 alkylsulphinyl acid or its reactive derivative. Any conversion of R2Ú, R11Ú, R12Ú or R6 may take place in any desired or necessary order. The compounds of the formula I are dopamine antagonists. Depending on their balance between peripheral and central action, the compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of disorders related to impaired gastrointestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux, peptic ulcer and emesis, and or in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, such as psychosis. All the compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of emesis. The quaternary salts of the compounds of formula I are of interest for their beneficial effect on gastric motility. The compounds of the present invention are dopamine antagonists and depending on their balance between peripheral and central action, may be used in the treatment of disorders relating to impaired gastro intestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux and peptic ulcer, and emesis, and or in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, such as psychosis. Compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is C16 alkoxy but one of R2, R11 and R12 is nitro are disclosed inUK Application No. 8019936, and applications claiming priority therefrom, purely as intermediates to the corresponding pharmacologically active amino compounds.It is now believed these compounds of the formula I are pharmacologically active per se. Accordingly the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I wherein R1 is C1 6 alkoxy or C16 alkylthio, but the third of R1, R11 and R12 as defined in formula I is nitro. Those compounds of the present invention which are of particular interest for their beneficial effect on gastric motility are the quaternary ammonium salts and N oxides of compounds of the formula I . The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or N oxide thereof or a solvent adduct of any of the foregoing and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the compound in the vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle.Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound of the invention. The invention further provides a method of treatment of disorders in mammals, such as humans, which comprises the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or N oxide thereof or a solvent adduct of any of the foregoing, as hereinbefore defined. An amount effective to treat the disorders hereinbefore described depends on the relative efficacies of the compounds of the invention, the nature and severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the mammal. However, a unit dose will normally contain 0.1 to 20mg for example 0.5 to 1Omg, of the compound of the invention. Unit doses will normally be administered more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day such that the total daily dose is normally in the range 0.01 to 1Omg kg per day.
