# Process for decarburizing alloy melts.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a two step process for decarburization of a shallow melt. First, the carbon content of the melt is reduced to an intermediate value in the range of about 0.3 to 0.1 wt. carbon by concurrently blowing an oxygen enriched gas onto the surface of the melt at a sub sonic velocity and injecting an inert gas below the melt surface to stir the melt. Second, the carbon content of the melt is further reduced to a final value of above 0.001 wt. carbon by injecting a mixture of oxygen enriched gas and inert gas below the surface of the melt for both decarburiz ing and stirring the melt.
