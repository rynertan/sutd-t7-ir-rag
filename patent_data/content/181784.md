# Digital signal processing system and method.

## Abstract
A digital signal processing system monitors variation of the signal level of a reproduced signal and also monitors variation of the differentiated signal level. The system generates a read enable pulse when the reproduced signal level rises or drops across a predetermined threshold level and this is followed by a zero crossing in the differentiated signal level.
