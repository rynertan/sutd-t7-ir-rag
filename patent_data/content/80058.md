## Abstract
An intermediate structure for use in the manufacture of semiconductor devices such as field effect transistors, com prises a monocrystalline semiconductor body having a first outer layer 2 , a central layer 3 and a second outer layer 4 each of said first and second outer layers being of semi conductor material different from the semiconductor mate rial of the central layer and forming a heterojunction 5, 6 whith the central layer. The thickness of the central layer 3 is of the order of the transport length of a charge carrier in the semiconductor material of that layer. Preferably, at least two adjacent layers of the intermediate structure have sub stantially equal electron energy work functions. A vertical field effect transistor is formed in a portion of an intermediate structure by removing areas 30, 31 of the second outer and central layers 4, 3 on each side of the portion, removing an area 32 of the second outer layer 4 at one end of the portion, etching the central layer 3 to form a web 22 connecting the first and second outer layers 2, 4 , forming insulation 25, 27 on the exposed surfaces of the first and second outer layers 2, 4 , forming a Schottky barrier electrode 23, 24 on the web and providing electrical contacts 35 to the first and second outer layers.
