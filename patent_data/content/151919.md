# MECHANICAL DRIVE SYSTEM FOR MOVING FUEL

## Abstract
A nuclear reactor including a mechanical drive system 10 for moving alternate nuclear reactor fuel rods 14 within the nuclear reactor core 12 and relative to the remaining stationary nuclear reactor fuel rods 16 so as to axially displace the movable fuel rods 14 , and enriched and natural uranium fuel zones defined therein, relative to similarly defined enriched and natural uranium fuel zones within the stationary fuel rods 16 in order to optimize utilization of excess or free neutrons produced within the nuclear reactor core within a fuel cycle.
