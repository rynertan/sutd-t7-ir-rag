# Method of detecting radioactive substance.

## Abstract
A method of detecting radioactive substance in a liquid sample which comprises steps of 1 supplying a radiation measuring instrument contain ing a stimulable phosphor with the liquid sample continu ously or intermittently 2 keeping said measuring instrument in contact with the liquid sample for a given period of time to cause the instrument to absorb at least a portion of radiation energy emitted by the radioactive substance in said liquid sample and 3 irradiating said measuring instrument with an elec tromagnetic wave to release the radiation energy stored in the instrument as stimulated emission, and photoelectrically detecting the stimulated emission to measure radioactivity of said liquid sample sequentially. The method is particularly useful when employed in con junction with liquid chromatography.
