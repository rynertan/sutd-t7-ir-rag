## Description
Carbocylic esters having liquid crystal properties at high temperatures This invention realtes to novel carbocyclic esters exhibiting a liquld crystalline phase over a broad temperature range and also having a positive dielectric anisotropy, and to liquid crystalline compositions containing the same. Display elements using liquid crystals have come to be widely used for watches, desk calculators, etc. Such liquid crystalline display elements utilize the properties of optical anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystalline substances, and the term liquid crystalline phase includes nematic, hectic and cholesteric liquid crystalline phases. However, display elements utilizing nematic liquid crystals have had the wildest practical use. The display modes of such display elements include the TN type twisted nematic type , the DS type dynamic scattering type , the guest host type, the DAD type, etc. and the properties required for the liquid crystalline substances to be used for each of the respective types are different. However, it is nearly always preferred that the liquid crystalline substances used for these display elements exhibit liquid crystalline properties within as broad a temperature range as possible in the natural world. At present, however, no single compound is known which satisfies by itself such conditions, and it is the present state of the art that the substances which are at present available for practical use have been obtained by blending several liquid crystalline and or non liquid crystalline compounds. Further, these substances should, of course, be stable to moisture, light, heat, air, etc. and also it is preferred for them that the threshold voltage and saturation voltage required for driving such display elements be as low as possible and their viscosities be as low as possible in order to make the response speed higher. As compounds for satisfying such requirement, such compounds as expressed by the formulasEMI2.1 where R1 represents an alkyl group X representsEMI3.1 and R2 represents an alkyl group, an alkoxy group or CN disclosed in U.S.P. 4,229,315 are well known and have had practical use. However, requirements for liquid crystalline display elements have become more severe, and in order to satisfy the requirements, liquid crystalline compositions which exhibit liquid crystai properties over a range extending from a lower temperature to a higher temperature have become necessary. Now, in order to broaden the liquid crystalline temperature range toward higher temperatures, it is necessary to use as a component liquid crystalline substances having a higher melting point. However, such liquid crystalline substances having a higher melting point generally have a higher viscosity and hence liquid crystalline compositions containing them also have a higher viscosity. Thus the response speeds, particularly that at lower temperatures, of liquid crystalline display elements which are usable up to higher temperatures such as 8O0C have been liable to be notably reduced.The present inventors have made strenuous studies for obtaining liquid crytalline substances satisfying the above mentioned requirement, and have found liquid crystalline substances which exhibit a liquid crystalline phase up to higher temperatures and nevertheless have a lower viscosity. The present invention resides in liquid crystalline ester compounds expressed by the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom,or an alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms EMI4.2 andEMI4.3 each representEMI4.4 X representsEMI4.5 Y represents a hydrogen atom , F, C or CN, and Z represents F, C or CN. and liquid crystalline compositions containing at least one member of said ester compounds. The compounds of the present invention exhibit a dielectric anisotropy value which is as small as about 0.5 to 10 they also exhibit a liquid crystalline phase up to higher temperatures they can elevate theN I point of liquid crystalline compositions by being added in a small amount to the compositions further particularly in the case of their halogen substitutes, the values of threshold and saturation voltages are unchanged or not increased so much in spite of their De values being reduced down to small values and also their viscosities are not elevated so much. Thus they are very useful compounds.Further they have superior stability to moisture, heat, light, air, etc. The compounds of the formula I are concretely classified into those expressed by the following 17 formulas II XVIII wherein each R has the same definition as in the formula I EMI5.1 wherein Z represents F, C2 or CN this applies to the following formulas III and IV EMI5.2 wherein Y and Z each represent F or C this applies to the following formulas VI XII EMI5.3 EMI6.1 wherein Z represents F, Cl or CN this applies to the following formula XIV EMI6.2 Next, the methods for preparing the compounds of the present invention will be described.
