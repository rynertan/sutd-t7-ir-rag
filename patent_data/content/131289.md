# Loop type data transmission reception network.

## Abstract
A loop type data transmission reception network system has a plurality of data processing stations and a single data transmission reception route which interconnects said sta tions in a loop for transmitting necessary data between the stations, each of the stations comprising a means 101 for detecting a breakdown in the data transmission reception route between the station itself and the preceding station b means 102 responsive to the detection of a break down in the data transmission reception route between the station itself and the preceding station by the detection means for transmitting break down information to the subsequent sta tion and means 103 for reversing the transmission direction in the data transmission reception route in accordance with the break down information transmitted by the break down information transmitting means.
