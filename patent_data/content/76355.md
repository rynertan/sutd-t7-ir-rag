# IMPROVED PERITONEAL DIALYSIS SOLUTION

## Abstract
An improved peritoneal dialysis solution comprises the conventional electrolyte combination of sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, lactate, and sodium hydroxide, the improvement comprising the use of a glucose polymer as the osmotic agent. In a preferred embodiment, the glucose polymer is found in a concentration of from 30 to 125 grams per liter. The large size of the glucose polymer molecules delays their passage through the peritoneum. In addition, the large glucose polymer molecules are slow to be metabolized in the blood. As a result, caloric intake is reduced and the length of time selective osmotic pressure may be applied is increased. Better B.U.N. Blood Urea and Nitrogen and creatinine clearances are thereby obtained, and the number of dialyses required can be reduced. Also disclosed is a method of use thereof.
