# INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
A piston 18 is reciprocable in a cylinder 28 , and a valve 22 opens and closes inlet 46 and exhaust 48 connections thereto. A shaft 24 extends from the piston 18 through the cylinder 28 and the valve 22 . One way drive means 68, 70 interconnects the shaft 24 and valve 22 for opening and closing the valve 22 as the piston 18 reciprocates. The piston 18 has a recess 114 below a valve port 52 to assist in uniform combustion and efficient clean operation.
