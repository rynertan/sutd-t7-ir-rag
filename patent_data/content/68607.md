# Exhaust treatment assembly for treating large volumes of exhaust gases.

## Abstract
A plurality of monolithic catalyst elements 12 are mounted in parallel in a plurality of recessed retaining portions of a bulkhead member 14 separating an inlet plenum from an outlet plenum of an exhaust gas cham ber 350 . The catalyst elements 12 are each compressed at one end into contact with a gasket member 20 in each retaining portion by force applying means 30 positioned so as to contact the other end of a plurality of catalyst elements at one time. In one embodiment, the various elements of the apparatus are formed of materials having different coefficients of ex pansion and related lengths so as to maintain compres sion without the use of specific spring elements. Other embodiments use springs 144, 244 to compress either a single catalyst element at a time or several at once.
