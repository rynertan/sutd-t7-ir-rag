# Positive displacement pump.

## Abstract
A sanitary positive displacement pump 1 having increased internal clearances to allow increased operating pressures without detrimental wear while maintaining high volumetric efficiency. the invention includes rigid and accu rate positioning of the liquid impellers 31,33 to the shafts 7,11 while maintaining ease of disassembly and assembly. The impellers are secured on the shafts by cooperating frus toconical surfaces 55,57 on each of a pair of nuts 47,49 . A rubber retainer ring 59,61 enables manual release of the nuts but prevent inadvertent spinoff.
