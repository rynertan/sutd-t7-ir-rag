## Description
MOLDED PRODUCT HAVING PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a molded product having a printed eircuit board. More particularly it relates to a molded product having a printed circuit board laminated with an ethylenic copolymer layer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, electronic equipment has been rapidly developed to be more compact, more lightweight, and more densely mounted. Especially, printed circuit board has been commercialized for use in domestic electrical machine such as radio, video camera, etc. Due to their ability to be mass produced and their high reliability, they are presently undergoing expanded use in industrial equipment such as telephone, computor, printer, etc. Heretofore it has been practiced that in order to mount a dense circuit three dimensionally in narrow spaces, the printed circuit board has been either bolted or bonded with an adhesive to the interior of a molded product like a case. In such a process, however, it is difficult to make the molded product compact, and moreover, troubles often occur, such as peeling off due to vibration, etc. or contacting with neighboring wiring or the like. Further, when a conventional thermosetting substrate was bonded to a molded product, it is very liable to peel off because of the difference in the thermal expansion between the substrate and the molded product. Furthermore, as the electronic equipment is made more compact it is more difficult to mount a printea circuit board by bolting or using an adhesive, resulting in poor operability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, an object of this invention is to provide a molded product having a printed circuit board, which is not only free from the above defects but also has an excellent heat resistance and which can be made compact and lightweight. A molded product comprising a layer of thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof hereinafter referred to as resiT layer having laminated thereon a printed circuit board which comprises a conductive metal layer and a thin wall body having a thickness of 3 Im to 5 mm and containing a crosslinked Product of a mixture of A 1 to 99 w t of an ethylenic copolymer which is comprised of 30 to 99.5 wtZ of ethylene unit, and at least one monomer unit selected from the group consisting of monocarboxylic acid unit, dicarboxylic acid unit, acid anhydride unit thereof and half ester unit thereof hereinafter referred to as ethylenic copolymer A and B 99 to 1 wt of an ethylenic copolymer which is comprised of 30 to 99.5 wt of ethylene unit, and at least one monomer unit selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl unit, amino unit and oxirane unit hereinafter referred to as ethylenic copolymer B and optionally interposing either ethylenic copolymer A or ethylenig copolymer B between the resin layer and the printed circuit board.

Figures 11 through 14 show a partially enlarged cross sectional view of molded products having a printed circuit board carrying a three dimensional circuit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention will be explained in more detail below. A Ethylenic copolymer A The ethylenic copolymer A used in this invention is an ethylenic copolymer which is comprised of 30 to 99.5 wt of ethylene unit, and at least one monomer unit selected from the group consisting of monocarboxylic acid unit, dicarboxylic acid unit, acid anhydride unit thereof, and half ester unit thereof hereinafter referred to as the monomer unit A . This ethylenic copolymer A includes a copolymer which can be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene with the following monomers for making up the monomer unit A , or the copolymer further containing other monomers, or the products which can be obtained by hydrolysis or alcohol modification of the acid anhydride group in these copolymers. Examples of the monomer for making up the monomer unit A hereafter referred to as monomer A include unsaturated monocarboxylic acids containing up to 25 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 10 carbon atoms, as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and crotonic acid unsaturated dicarboxylic acids containing 4 to 50 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 30 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 20 carbon atoms, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, 4 methylcyclohexane 4 en 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, and bicyclo 2,2,l hepta 5 en 2,3 dicarboxylic acid, and anhydrides of these unsaturated dicarboxylic acids. Also, as the other monomers there may be mentioned unsaturated carboxylic acid esters containing up to 30 carbon atoms, preferably up to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably up to 12 carbon atoms, such as methyl meth acrylate, ethyl meth acrylate, alkoxyalkyl meth acrylate, n butyl meth acrylate, n hexyl meth acrylate, n octyl meth acrylate, and 2 ethylhexyl meth acrylate and vinyl esters containing up to 30 carbon atoms, preferably up to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably up to 12 carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, and isopropenyl acetate. Of the ethylenic copolymer A , the copolymers of ethylene and an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride and the copolymers of the above monomers and an unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and or a vinyl ester may be subjected to hydrolysis and or alcohol modification to partially or wholly convert the dicarboxylic acid anhydride unit in these copolymers into dicarboxylic acid unit or half ester unit. The hydrolysis can be carried out by reacting the ethylenic copolymer A with water generally at a temperature of 80 to 1000C for 0.5 to 10 hours preferably 2 to 6 hours, more preferably 3 to 6 hours in the presence of a catalyst such as a tertiary amine e.g., triethylamine in an organic solvent which can dissolve the copolymer, and neutralizing the resulting solution with an acid. The alcohol modification can be carried out according to the solution process or kneading process described below. The solution process is a process wherein the ethylenic copolymer A is reacted with an alcohol in the presence or absence in which case the reaction is slow of the above described catalyst at a reflux temperature of the alcohol generally for 2 minutes to 5 hours preferably 2 minutes to 2 hours, more preferably 15 minutes to 1 hour in an organic solvent as in the case of the hydrolysis. On the other hand, the kneading process is a process wherein the ethylenic copolymer A is allowed to react by kneading with about 0.01 to 1.0 part by weight preferably 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight on the basis of 100 parts by weight of the copolymer A of a tertiary mine and about 0.1 to 3.0 moles preferably 1.0 to 2.0 moles of an alcohol per mole of dicarboxylic acid anhydride unit in the copolymer A at a temperature higher than the melting point of the copolymer A but lower than the boiling point of the alcohol used, for several minutes to several tens minutes preferably 10 minutes to 30 minutes by means of a kneading machine such as Banbury mixer, extruder, etc. that are commonly used in the fields of rubber, synthetic resin, etc. Examples of the alcohol used in the above described alcohol modification include straight chain or branched chain alcohols containing preferably 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and primary butyl alcohol. In the case of the hydrolysis as well as the alcohol modification, the conversion to dicarboxylic acid and the esterification to half ester is both preferably 0.5 to 100 , and more preferably 10.0 to 100 . The content of the ethylene unit in the ethylenic copolymer A is 30 to 99.5 wt , preferably 30 to 99.0 wt , and more preferably 35 to 99.0 wt . The total content of the monomer unit A i.e., the monocarboxylic acid unit, the dicarboxylic acid unit, the acid anhydride unit and the half ester unit in the copolymer is 0.1 to 70 Wt , preferably 0.5 to 70 wt , more preferably 0.5 to 60 wt , and most preferably 0.5 to 40 wt . If the content of the monomer unit A is less than 0.1 wt , when crosslinked with the ethylenic copolymer B by heating, not only does the crosslinking become incomplete, but also the adhesion to the metal layer becomes insufficient.Whereas, even if the content exceeds 70 wt , the characteristic features of this invention may be manifested, but it is not preferred from the economically standpoints. Further, when copolymer further containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and or a vinyl ester as a comonomer component is used, the total content of these esters in the colymer is up to .69.9 wt , preferably less than 60 wS, and more preferably less than 50 If the content exceeds 69.9 wit , the softening point of the copolymer A rises, so that the fluidity is deteriorated below 1500C, and further it is not economical. B Ethylenic copolymer B The ethylenic copolymer B used in this invention is an ethylenic copolymer which is comprised of 30 to 99.5 wt z of ethylene unit, and at least one monomer unit selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl unit, amino unit, and oxirane unit hereinafter referred to as the monomer unit B . Of the monomer unit B , oxirane unit is particularly preferred because the resulting thin wall body exhibits excellent adhesion with the metal layer The ethylenic copolymer B includes a copolymer which can be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene with the following monomers for making up the monomer unit B , the copolymer further containing other monomers, and saponification products of a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl ester especially vinyl acetate . Examples of the monomer for making up the monomer unit B hereinafter referred to as monomer B include hydroxyalkyl meth acrylates having the alkyl moiety of up to 30 carbon atoms and preferably 1 to 25 carbon atoms, a alkenylalcohols having up to 30 carbon atoms and preferably 3 to 25 carbon atoms, a alkenylamines having up to 30 carbon atoms and preferably 2 to 25 carbon atoms, primary or secondary aminoalkyl meth acrylates having the alkyl moiety of up to 30 carbon atoms and preferably 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and compounds having an oxirane ring represented by the following general formulae I to III EMI9.1 wherein R1, R5 and R8 which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group R2, R6 and R7 which may also be the same or different, each reprosents a straight chain or branched chain alkylene group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms R and R4 each represents a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having up to 12 carbon atoms and a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms and having an oxirane group at the terminal, provided that at least one of R3 andR has the alkyl group having an oxirane group and n is 0 or 1. Examples of the monomer B include butenecarboxylic acid monoglycidyl ester, glycidyl methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate, methylglycidyl acrylate, methylglycidyl methacrylate, itaconic acid glycidyl ester, 7,8 epoxy l octyl methacrylate, itaconic acid methylglycidyl ester, 7,8 epoxy 1octyl vinyl ether, vinyl glycidyl ether, allyl glycidyl ether, 2 methyl 2 propenyl glycidyl ether, hydroxymethyl meth acrylate, hydroxyethyl meth acrylate, hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, hydroxyhexyl meth acrylate, allyl alcohol, allylamine, and aminoethyl meth acrylate. Also, as the other monomers there may be mentioned the above described unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and vinyl ester. The content of the ethylene unit in this ethylenic copolymer B is 30 to 99.5 wt , preferably 30 to 99.o wt , and more preferably 35 to 99.0 wt . Also, the total content of the monomer unit B i.e., the hydroxyl unit, the amino unit, and the oxirane unit in the copolymer is 0.1 to 70 wt , preferably 0.5 to 70 wt , more preferably 0.5 to 60 wt , and most preferably 0.5 to 4u wt , for the same reason as in the case of the above described ethylenic copolymer A .Further, when the copolymer containing the above described unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and or vinyl ester, as a comonomer component is used, the total content of these esters is up to 69.9 wt , and preferably less than 60 wt for the same reason as in the case of the above described ethylenic copolymer A . The melt index as defined later with respect to the tllermoplastic resins of the above described ethylenic copoly meres and B is generally 0.01 to 1000 gilO min., preferably 0.05 to 500 g 10 min., more preferably 0.1 to 500 g 10 min., and most preferably 0.1 to 300 10 min.When those copolymers having the M.I. of less than 0.01 g 10 min. are used, not only is the homogeneous mixing of these copolymers difficult, but also the moldability of the resulting mixture is not good. Of these ethylenic copolymers, where they are prepared by a copolymerization process, ethylene and the monomer A or the monomer B , or these and other monomers are copolymerized at a temperature of 120 to 2600C under a high pressure of usually 500 to 2500 kg cm in the presence of a free radical generator for example, organic peroxide .Such a process is well known. Also, the process wherein hydrolysis and or alcohol modification are carried out for the preparation of the above described ethylenic copolymer A and the process wherein saponification is carried out for the preparation of the ethylenic copolymer B are also well known. C Preparation of mixture I Mixing ratio When preparing the mixture of this invention, the mixing ratio by weight of the ethylenic copolymer A to the ethylenic copolymer B is 1 99 to 99 1, preferably 5 95 to 95 5, and more preferably 10 90 to 90 10. In the case where the mixing ratio is less than 1 99 or exceeds 99 1, when the mixture is crosslinked by the later described process, the crosslinking is insufficient, so that the resulting thin wall body does not exhibit good adhesion to the conductive metal layer as later described. 2 Mixing method The mixture can be obtained by homogeneously mixing the ethylenic copolymer A and the ethylenic copolymer B in accordance with, for example, the dry blending method using a mixer such as Henschel mixer in wide use in the field of olefinic polymer, or the melt kneading method using a mixer such as Banbury, extruder, or roll mill. More homogeneous mixture can be obtained by melt kneading the mixture which has been dry blended. In the melt kneading it is important that a crosslinking reaction does not substantially take place between the ethylenic copolymer A and the ethylenic copolymer B . If the crosslinking occur, when the resulting mixture is processed by molding as later described, not only does the moldability become poor but also the heat resistance of the molded product is lowered.For the reason, the melt kneading temperature is from room temperature 20 C to 1500C, preferably below 140 C, though it varies depending on the kind and the viscosity of the ethylenic polymers used. When the melt kneading is carried out at a relatively high temperature e.g., 100 to 1500C , the kneading time should not be too long and it is generally 1 to 5 minutes. As a tentative criterion of this mixture with substantially no crosslinking reaction , residual particles larger than 0.1 micron in diameter after 3 hour extraction of the mixture in boiling toluene hereinafter referred to as extraction residue is in general not more than 15 wt , preferably not more than 10 wt , and most preferably not more than 5 wt . In the preparation of this mixture, so far as the characteristics physical properties of the thin wall body of this invention are not impaired, there may be added the additives widely used in the field of olefinic polymer such as stabilizers to oxygen, light ultraviolet rays , and heat a metal deterioration preventing agent, a flame retarder, an electrical characteristics improving agent, an antistatic agent, a lubricant, a processibility improving agent, and a viscosity improving agent.Further, by adding a crosslinking promotor such as a monoamine type compound, a polyamine type compound, an epoxy compound, p toluenesulfonic acid, zinc chloride, magnesium acetate, an ammonium halide, and phosphoric acid, which varies depending on the kind of the ethylenic copolymers A and B , the crosslinking of the ethylenic copolymers A and B in the later described heat treatment under pressure can be completed more easily. The amount of the crosslinking promotor is usually up to 5.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.005 to 3.0 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the copolymers.Also, insulation property of the thin wall body can be improved by adding an insulating ceramic such as alumina or silicon nitride. In addition to the above, by filling inorganic powdery materials,glass fiber, glass beads, etc.the function of this invention can be more enhanced. D Preparation of thin wall body In the case where the thin wall body of this invention is utilized in the form of film or sheet, the thin wall body can be obtained by extruding the above described mixture into the form of film or sheet by means of the extruder, in accordance with the T die film inflation process generally used in the field of thermoplastic resin. In the such case, the extrusion temperature is 2500C or lower.If the extrusion is carried out at a temperature higher than 250 C, the ethylenic copolymers A and B are partially crosslinked, giving rise to small masses of gel like material, so that it is not possible to obtain a homogeneous extrusion molding. Therefore, the extrusion temperature should be in the same range as in the case of the melt kneading irrespectively of whether the crosslinking promotor has been added or not. The thin wall bodies thus prepared are quenched in a water tank or using a water cooled roll in order to prevent the thin wall bodies from adhering to each other or to a take up roll, whereby highly transparent thin wall bodies can be obtained. The thickness of the thin wall body is generally 5 to 400 microns and preferably 10 to 200 microns. E Heat treatment under pressure Since in the thin wall body thus obtained crosslinking has scarcely proceeded, it shows almost the same behavior as that of the ordinary thin wall bodies. It is important that in order to impart the heat resistance the thin wall body is heat treated under pressure at a tempera ture of 100 to 4000C. While the temperature varies depending on the kind and the content of the reactive groups in the ethylenic copolymers A and B and the presence or absence of a crosslinking promotor.For instance, the thinwall body is generally heat treated under pressure for 10 to 20 minutes when the heating temperature is in the range of 100 to 1600C for 1 to 10 minutes at 160 to 2409C and for less than 5 minutes at 240 to 4000C whereby the crosslinking reaction condensation reaction takes place and the heat resistance is remarkably increased. The thus crosslinked thin wall body generally has the extraction residue of 60 or more, preferably 70 or more, and more preferably 75 or more. It is preferred to laminate, as shown in Figures 8 and 9, either the ethylenic copolymer A or the ethylenic copolymer B on the surface of the crosslinked thin wall body, because the thin wall body thus laminated exhibits excellent adhesiveness when heat treated under pressure.Figures 8 and 9 show a partially enlarged cross sectional view of the representative printed circuit boards of this invention before and after formation of a circuit. In these figures, 4 is the crosslinked thin wall body, and 7 is an adhesive layer of ethylenic copolymer A or B . The ethylenic copolymer A or B can be laminated on the surface of the crosslinked thin wall body according to a lamination process commonly practiced in the field of general thermoplastic resin such as extrusion T die molding process, roll lamination process, press lamination process, etc. That is to say, molten ethylenic copolymer A or B is laminated on the surface of the crosslinked thin wall bodies. The thinner is the ethylenic copolymer A or B layer, the more the heat resistance and the humidity resistance are improved.The thickness is generally 1 to 100 microns, preferably 2 to 50 microns, and more preferably 3 to 30 microns. Even when the thickness is less than 1 micron, the effect of this invention can be manifested, but as it is difficult to achieve steady production of such a thin layer as long as a common molding machine is used. On the other hand, when the thickness exceeds 100 microns, the reactive groups of the ethylenic copolymer A or B remain unreacted in an increased proportion when heat treated under pressure, so that although good adhesion is obtained, it is undesirable in that the thin wall body thus obtained have portions poor in heat resistance. The molded product of this invention can be prepared in such a manner that after the crosslinked or non crosslinked thin wall body with or without the adhesive layer containing the ethylenic copolymer A and the ethylenic copolymer B as the main components,or a laminated material obtained by laminating the thin wall body and various materials as later described other than the thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof and the conductive metal layer is inserted into the mold, the later described thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof is molded according to the molding process which is widely employed in the field of synthetic resin, such as injection molding process, compression stamping molding process, thermoforming process for example, vacuum forming, pressure forming , hollow molding process, and lamination molding process. F Thermoplastic resin Typical examples of the thermoplastic resins are shown below. Olefin polymers polyamide resins polycarbonate resins styrene polymers graft polymers resulting from graft polymerization of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound to chlorinated polyethylene or a mixture of chlorinated polyethylene and a copolymer of styrene and at least one other vinyl compound hereinafter referred to as impact resistant resins A impact resistant resins prepared by graft copolymerization of at least one vinyl compound selected from the group consisting of styrene, acrylonitrile, and methyl methacrylate to at least one rubber selected from the group consisting of butadiene rubber, acrylate rubber and ethylene propylene rubber these impact resistant resins are hereinafter referred to as impact resistant resins B phenylene oxide polymers, aromatic polyesters, oxymethylene polymers and vinyl chloride polymers. These thermoplastic resins are mass produced industrially and widely used in various fields. They are described below in detail. 1 Olefin Polymers Olefin polymers which are used as the thermoplastic resins of the present invention include an ethylene homopolymer, a propylene homopolymer, an ethylene propylene copolymer, and copolymers of ethylene and or propylene and other a olefins having 12 or less carbon atoms the proportion of the a olefin is generally 20 by weight or less .The melt index as determined according to ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of 1900C under a load of 2.16 kg or melt flow index as determined according to ASTM D 1238 at a temperature of 230 C under a load of 2.16 kg of the olefin polymer is preferably from 0.01 to 100 g 10 min. and more preferably from 0.02 to 80 g 10 min. If M.I. or MFI is less than 0.01 g 10 min., the resulting mixture is poor in moldability. On the other hand, if an olefin polymer having an M.I. or MFI of more than 100 g 10 min. is used, the ultimate mold has poor mechanical properties. An ethylene homopolymer, copolymers of ethylene and a small amount of a olefins as described above, a propylene homopolymer, and random or block copolymers of propylene, ethylene and or other aolefins are desirable. These olefin polymers are produced by homo or copolymerizing olefins by the use of a catalyst system comprising a transition metal compound and an organoaluminum compound a so called Ziegler catalyst , a catalyst comprising a support e.g., silica and a chromium containing compound e.g., chromium oxide deposited on the support a so called Phillips catalyst , or a radical initiator e.g., organic peroxides . In addition, modified polyolefins prepared by graft polymerization of compounds containing at least one double bond e.g., unsaturated carboxylic acids, monobasic carboxylic acids, and vinylsilane compounds to the above olefin polymers can be used. Methods of production of these olefin resins and modified polyolefins are well known. These olefin polymers and modified polyolefins can be used singly or in combination with each other.

In the practice of the insert injection molding, the above thin wall body or laminated material is placed between a male mold and a female mold and then the mold is closed. Thereafter, the thermoplastic resin or its composition containing an inorganic filler is introduced into the mold through a gate part of the male mold and cooled, and then the mold is opened, whereupon the desired molded product is obtained.In the insert injection molding, the resin temperature is higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin but lower than the decomposition temperature thereof. If the injection pressure is such that the gauge pressure in the nozzle portion of the cylinder of the injection molding machine is at least 100 kg cm2, molding in a form nearly equivalent with the shape of the mold can be attained.Furthermore, there can be obtained an article having good appearance. The injection pressure is usually from 200 to 2,000 kg cm2 and preferably from 200 to 1,500 kg cm2. 2 Production of Vacuum Molding Method, Etc. In accordance with this method, the thermoplastic resin or its composition containing an inorganic filler is extruded in the form of a sheet by a T die molding method and laminate on the aforesaid thin wall body or laminated material. The thus produced laminated sheet is fixed by means of iron frames or snail shaped devices, fitted to a jig that makes easy handling, and then introduced into an apparatus where it is heated by means of ceramic heaters or wire heaters arranged at upper and lower positions. The sheet starts to melt on heating. On continuing the heating after sagging of the sheet once occurred, the sheet is stretched in the frame. At this point when the above phenomenon is observed, the sheet is in good condition for molding of the sheet, so that no wrinkles or unevenness in thickness is formed.At this point, the sheet frame is taken out of the heating apparatus, placed on the top portion of a mold, and vacuum molded under a reduced pressure of 1 atmospheric pressure, whereupon the desired mold can be obtained. Thereafter, it is cooled with air or sprayed water and taken out of the mold. In accordance with pressure molding, a sheet which has become easy to handle is placed on a mold, a chamber for applying pressure is placed on the sheet, and then the sheet is pressed toward the mold under a pressure of from 2 to 6 atmospheric pressure, preferably from 3 to 5 atmospheric pressure while at the same time the mold is pushed upward. 3 Production by Stamping Molding In producing the molded product of the present invention, a laminated sheet as produced by the above described vacuum molding method is placed in a squeezing mold fitted to a vertical press machine and then heat molded under a pressure of from 5 to 60 kg cm2 preferably from 10 to 60 kg cm2. more preferably from 10 to 50 kg cm2 whereupon the desired mold can be obtained. The mold is then cooled with air or sprayed water and then taken out of the mold. In this molding, the press time is usually at least 10 seconds, and generally from 10 to 60 seconds. In order to improve surface characteristics, it is preferred that the molding be performed under two stage pressure conditions. At the first stage, the laminated sheet is pressed under a pressure of from 5 to 20 kg cm2 for from 10 to 40 seconds and at the second stage it is pressed under a pressure of from 40 to 50 kg cm2 for at least 5 seconds, whereupon there can be obtained a mold having superior surface smoothness.Particularly, when an inorganic filler containing thermoplastic composition layer having poor fluidity is used, it is desirable to employ the above two stage molding method. 4 Molding Temperature The molding temperature in the above injection molding method, vacuum molding method, pressure molding method, and stamping molding method varies with the type of the thermoplastic resin. Preferred molding temperatures for several thermoplastic resins are shown in Table 1 below.

In these molding processes the above described thin wall body or laminated material is beforehand inserted between the male and female dies of the metal mold as in the case of injection molding process, and then thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof is molded by a usual method, whereby there is obtained one body molding. Further, in lamination molding process, thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof is laminated on the above described thin wall body or laminated material by dry lamination process, hot lamination process, extruding lamination process, etc., to obtain one body molding. In the manufacture of the molded product having printed circuit board of this invention, the injection molding process and the stamping molding process are preferable, and the injection molding process is more preferable because it is not only easy and simple but also capable of producing molded products of various complicated shapes. H Conductive Metal Layer The conductive metal layer required for the printed circuit board of this invention can be formed on the thinwall body or laminated material hereinafter collectively referred to as thin wall body using metal foil as later described, or by vacuum deposition method of metal, elec troless plating method, and combined use of electroless plating and electroplating methods. 1 Kind of metal Examples of the metal used include aluminum, gold, silver, copper, nickel, and platinum and an alloy containing these metals as the main ingredient more than 50 wt , but in general copper, which has good electroconductivity, is preferred. 2 Foil The thickness of the metal foil is usually 5 to 500 microns, preferably 10 to 300 microns, and more preferably 15 to 100 microns. Among the above described metals electrolytic copper foil of 15 to 50 microns in thickness is preferably used. The metal foil laminated on the thin wall body is pattern wise etched in a conventional manner to form a circuit. 3 Vacuum deposition As the vacuum deposition method of metal there may be applied vacuum heat deposition method using resistance heating, electron beam heating, induction heating, thermal radiation heating, etc. or sputtering, and the like.Especially for use as micro circuit, platinum and gold are preferably used, and in the case where a circuit is to be formed by etching after the formation of this film, copper and aluminum, and also an alloy containing these metals as the main ingredient are used by preference. The thickness of the conductive thin film vacuum deposited may be freely chosen depending on the condition of the apparatus employed, but it is usually 100 A to 100 microns, and preferably 1000 A to 20 microns. In addition, the conductive surface path having these metals vacuum deposited can be electroplated with copper, nickel, gold, etc. for the purpose of surface protection and anticorrosion, or can be soldered by passing through a solder bath. The circuit may also be formed on the surface and inner surface of through holes of the thin wall body according to the so called fully additive process utilizing the vacuum deposition technique. Generally speaking, an insulation material used in the fully additive process is one which has an adhesive coated on the surface, but the thinwall body of this invention shows excellent adhesion to the vacuum deposited film even without the use of an adhesive, and a printed circuit board can be easily obtained. For example, the thin wall body is cut into lengths of predetermined dimension and holes are bored by either punching, drilling, or pressing.Then, a negative pattern with respect to circuit is formed by screen printing or non circuit portion is masked with a photosensitive material, and vacuum deposition is carried out on the masked thin wall body so that vacuum deposited metal film of a prescribed thickness can be formed on the unmasked circuit portion. In the fully additive process, a layer which functions not only as a photosensitive material but also as an adhesiveis generally formed, and by exposing to light this layer, only the circuit portion is made adhesive and readily capable of forming a deposition film thereon. In the printed circuit board of this invention, however, such a layer is not needed, and the vacuum deposition metal film may be formed directly on the surface of the thin wall body with good adhesion, so that it is not only adapted for mass production system, but also free from defects in the ordinary etching e.g., pattern break and a precise circuit can be formed with ease. After the vacuum deposition, gold, tin, solder, etc. can also be plated for the purpose of protection and anticorrosion of the circuit and further molding IC chip. The printed circuit board of this invention can be obtained by any of adhesive printing process, adhesive photograph process and direct process that are practical in the fully additive process. 4 Electroless plating In general, nickel plating, highly corrosion resistant zinc nickel alloy plating, copper plating, etc. are known as the electroless plating or chemical plating , but for use as the printed circuit substrate copper sulfate plating is usually employed which can provide densely plated coating of uniform thickness on the entire surface of a substrate in contact with the plating solution with outstanding adhesion and ductility between the substrate and the plated coating. The copper sulfate plating is advantageous in that the plated coating is made of fine crystals having stabilized workability and excellent physical properties. In the copper sulfate plating, metallic copper is generally supplied into the plating solution, and in order to enhance the electrical conductivity and the uniformity in electrodeposition of the solution, copper sulfate and sulfuric acid are added. Further, chloride ion as catalyst and a suitable amount of brightening agent are used. In addition, polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene derivatives may be added to improve the uniformity in thickness of the plated coating.The representative composition of the copper sulfate plating solution comprises 5 to 40 g of copper sulfate CuSO4 5H20 per 1 liter of an aqueous solution a pH adjuster buffer such as sodium hydroxide NaOH , ammonium chloride NH4C1 , etc. a compound to prevent extraordinary deposition of copper in the aqueous solution such as sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA 2Na and a reducing agent such as formalin HCHO . The conductive surface path obtained by the electroless plating can also be electroplated with copper, nickel, gold, etc. for the purpose of surface protection and anticorrosion, or soldered by passing through a solder bath. The fully additive process may also be carried out in this invention utilizing the electroless plating technique wherein the circuit is formed by electroless plating the surface and inner surface of through holes of the above described thin wall body, wherein the etching step as in the case of metal foil laminated plate is not needed. I Printed Circuit Board The printed circuit board used in this invention comprises the thin wall body or laminated material and the conductive metal layer as described above. The term printed circuit board herein used include those before and after the formation of circuit. Various other materials used in the laminated material are described later, in which case, however, it is necessary that the thin wall body should be interposed between the conductive metal layer and the other material layer. It is preferred that in order to improve the adhesion between the printed circuit board and the resin layer i.e., the layer of the thermoplastic resin or the composition thereof the ethylenic copolymer A or B be interposed therebetween. 1 Other Material As other material there may be mentioned the plate of the metal or alloy of the above described conductive metal layer, glass or aramid woven or nonwoven fabric, and film of heat resistant thermoplastic resin such as polyamideimide, polyimide, and polyester. The thickness of the metal or alloy is usually 0.02 to 3.0 mm, and preferably 0.1 to 2.0 mm. Also, the thickness of the glass woven fabric or nonwoven fabric is 5 microns to 5 mm, and preferably 20 microns to 1.0 mm. Further, the thickness of the film of heat resistant thermoplastic resin is 3 microns to 1.0 mm, and preferably 10 to 200 microns.A product obtained by laminating glass woven fabric between the thin wall bodies is particularly preferred since deformation due to the flow of the molten resin at the time of injection molding can be prevented and the resulting molded product has an improved dimensional stability. 2 Preparation of Printed Circuit Board The thin wall body of this invention is heat treated under pressure and then the conductive metal layer may be formed on one side of the resulting crosslinked product by any one of the vacuum deposition, electroless plating, or combination of electroless plating and electroplating hereinafter referred to as process A , or metal foil and the thin wall body may be heat treated under pressure. Also, the conductive metal layer may be formed on one side of the resulting crosslinked product, and moreover, either of the ethylenic copolymer A or B may be laminated on another side of the thin wall body. The latter is used for laminating on the surface of molded thermoplastic resin or composition product. Since the thin wall body obtained in this invention exhibits adhesiveness above 100 C, the effect of this invention can be much enhanced by bonding it with the metal layer simultaneously with the crosslinking treatment. That is to say, the mixture of ethylenic copolymer A and ethylenic copolymer B shows thermoplasticity at a temperature below 2500C, but when the mixture is heat treated under pressure above 1000C crosslinking reaction takes place and at the same time the adhesiveness is manifested. In the case where air, etc. are entrapped between the metal foil and the thin wall body it is necessary to carry out thermocompression bonding by the use of a hot press or hot roll. Although satisfactory adhesion can be obtained even below 300 C, where the heat resistance is required or desired, the compression bonding is preferably carried out at a temperature as high as possible usually 200 to 3000C . J Molded Product Having Printed Circuit Board The molded product of this invention can be prepared by molding the printed circuit board and thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof according to the above described molding process. Also, it can be prepared by forming the conductive metal layer in such a manner that the thin wall body or laminated material is molded together with thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof, and a conductive metal layer is formed on the surface of the thin wall body by insertion molding or other molding processes. The molded product of this invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of the representative molded product of the present invention wherein I indicates thermoplastic resin or the composition thereof resin layer , and 2 indicates printed circuit board. Figures 2 through 7 are a partially enlarged cross sectional view of tne molded products ofFigure 1, wherein resin layer 1, thin wall body 4 and conductive metal layer 3 or these and other material layer heat resistant film 5, glass woven or nonwoven fabric 6 are laminated. Figure 2 shows the case where thin wall body 4 being interposed between resin layer 1 and conductive metal layer 3 Figure 3 shows the case where thin wall body 4, heat resistant film 5, thin wall body 4 and conductive metal layer 3 are successively laminated on resin layer 1 andFigure 4 indicates the case where thin wall body 4, glass woven or nonwoven fabric 6, thin wall body 4, and conductive metal layer 3 are successively laminated on resin layer 1.Figures 5 through 7 are partially enlarged cross sectional views of the molded products of this invention where conductive metal layer 3 and thin wall body 4 with or without one or more other material layers are molded together with resin layer and then a circuit is formed by etching or where a circuit is formed by etching and then the molding was carried out. Furthermore, it is also possible that a circuit is formed on the thin wall body and then this printed circuit board is molded together with the thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof, or the thin wall body and the thermoplastic resin or a composition thereof are molded and then a circuit may be formed on the resulting molded product by plating, etc. Also, as shown in Figures 8 and 9, ethylenic copolymer A or B 7 in Figures 8 and 9 may be bonded to thinwall body before or after formation of a circuit, and the surface of the bonded copolymer layer and the surface of a molded product are superposed in a face to face relation after formation of a circuit as shown in Figure 10, followed by heating under pressure, whereby a molded product having a printed circuit board can be obtained. In this case the bonding temperature is usually 40 to 200 C, preferably 80 to 1800C, and more preferably 100 to 1600C. The pressure is generally 1 to 100 kg cm, and at a temperature above 1000C the pressure is sufficient if it is high enough to exclude air bubbles entrapped on the bonded surface.According to this process, the adhesion as well as the heat resistance can be improved. It is assumed that the reacting radicals of the laminated ethylenic copolymer A or B react with both the crosslinked thin wall body and the bonded surface of the resin layer at the same time. A printed circuit board can be easily provided even on a curved surface or complex surface in shape of a molded product according to this invention since either of the ethylenic copolymers A and B part of 7 in Figures 8 and 9 is so flexible before the thermocompression bonding that it can completely conform to the shape of the irregular surface. Moreover, the printed circuit board of this invention can be bonded even on modified cross section by devising an apparatus which is capable of uniform thermocompression bonding for example, press metal mold . Other processes which are generally employed in manufacture of multilayer laminated product can also be used. For example, it is a process such that the thin wall bodies are uniformly disposed between respective laminated products, and temporary bonding is carried out at room temperature, and thereafter the resulting laminated product is subjected to heat treatment under pressure at a tempera ture above 400C. In this process, each layer can be temporarily bonded one by one to finally laminate all of them and then subjected to heat treatment under pressure, whereby a multilayered printed circuit board can be lamination molded to a molded product. Further, in a process wherein a circuit beforehand formed on the thin wall body is laminated, various kinds of three dimensional circuit as shown below can be formed. Figure 11 indicates the case where circuit surface 3 is in contact with resin layer 1. Figures 12 and 13 indicate the case where the laminated circuit with through hole s printed circuit board is formed, and then this printed circuit board and resin layer 1 are laminated.Figure 14 indicates the case where thin wall body 4 is laminated on both sides of resin layer 1, and they are connected with a through hole. In this case both the upper and lower surfaces of the molded product are provided with a circuit, and yet these circuits may be connected by the through hole. Also, as shown in Figure 5, thin wall body 4 may be disposed on the surface of a molded product, and then conductive layer is formed only on the circuit portion by additive process or the like. The thin wall body with a circuit obtained in this invention can be used as a thin wall body film or sheet which is capable of forming a circuit integrated with machinery or apparatus or a molded product. The molded product of this invention possesses the following effects characteristics . 1 Since the printed circuit board and the thermoplastic resin layer or the thermoplastic resin composition layer containing an inorganic filler can be molded together, not only it is possible to omit a step by which a printed circuit board is anchored to a molded product as usual, but also there are no troubles accompanying the step. 2 As a circuit can be formed within the interior of a molded product, it is possible to make the product more compact and more lightweight. 3 As three dimensional circuit can be formed, complicated circuit can be avoided, and thus connecters required for the complicated circuit decrease in number and reduces accidents. 4 In manufacture of molded products for electronic equipment thermoplastic resins hitherto conventionally used can be used, and therefore variety of products can be expanded. 5 As the thin wall body has excellent heat resistance, soldered joint can be made on the surface of the thin wall body. 6 The thin wall body has excellent electrical char acteristics for example, insulation property, dielectric strength, discharge tangent performance tan . Since the molded product of this invention exhibits the above described effects, it can be utilized as a part of various kinds of machinery and apparatus and molded products. The representative of these machinery and apparatus and molded products are shown below. 1 Domestic machinery and apparatus such as washing machine, refrigerator, electronic oven, television receiver, video camera, radio cassette recorder, speaker unit, etc. 2 Motorcar accessaries for example, instrument panel, light, wiper, door . 3 Machine in office use for example, word processor, printer thereof, wet or dry type duplicating machine, facsimile, computors, desk computor . 4 Others, such as camera, switch board, telephone, fire alarm, clock.

EXAMPLES 39 TO 41 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 7, 8 AND 9 Various printed circuit boards were prepared by heat pressing copper foil thickness 17 microns and film of Mixture I thickness 100 microns as in Example 1 Example 39 by laminating copper foil thickness 17 microns , film of Mixture I thickness 50 microns , glass plain woven fabric used in Example 29, and film of Mixture I thickness 50 microns in this order Example 40 by plating films thickness 100 microns of EAA ComparativeExample 7 and Saponified Product Comparative Example 8 , as in Example 34 or by coating a epoxy resin on electrolytic copper foil thickness 35 microns and drying Comparative Example 9 . The printed circuit boards and ABS were stampingmolded in two steps being held for 30 seconds under a pressure of 20 kg cm2 in the first step, and for 20 seconds under under a pressure of 50 kg cm in the second step, while the surface temperature was 1600 C, whereby the grips of telephone receiver were prepared. Further, electrolytic copper foil thickness 35 microns , film of Mixture IV thickness 100 microns , sheet of modified PPO thickness 3 mm , film of Mixture IV thickness 100 microns and electrolytic copper foil thickness 35 microns were laminated crosslinked while being held for 30 seconds at 2500C under a pressure of 20 kg cm, as shown in Figure 14, whereby a laminated product was prepared. The printed circuit board was stamping molded in the same manner as above, except that the surface temperature was 1700C. In the laminated products thus obtained, through holes of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm diameter were bored, and the through hole portions were plated using the chemical plating solution as in Example 34 to thereby form plated copper coating having a thickness of about 5 microns Example 41 . With respect to the molded products obtained in Examples 1 to 14, 29 to 35, 38 to 41 and Comparative Examples 1, 2, 5, 7 to 9 the peeling strength was measured. The results are shown in Table 6. The boundary surface peeling off is also shown in Table 6, in which metal means conductive metal layer copper foil, etc. , film means the films ofMixtures I through IV , EAA, and Saponified Product , and resin means the thermoplastic resins or thermoplastic resins composition containing inorganic fillers to be injection molded.

In all Examples, peeling, cracking, breaking, or other deformation could not be detected either between layers of the resin layer and the printed circuit board or between the printed circuit board and the copper circuit.These results indicate that the adhesive layer has satisfactory heat resistance. On the other hand, in the molded product obtained in each Comparative Example, melting was recognized in the printed circuit board and the copper circuit was peeled apart from the board. The foregoing results of the Examples and Comparative Examples indicate that since a circuit can formed as an integral part of the molded product on the inside surface of the molded product in this invention, not only can extremely compact machinery or apparatus be designed, but also there are a number of advantages such that because of excellent heat resistance soldering can be made directly on the circuit the circuit does not peel off from the machinery or apparatus by shock or the like, three dimensional wiring can be made by laminating either by insertion molding or by heating under pressure, and on account of the fact that the wiring is not in hanged or suspended state within the machinery and apparatus there is no danger of causing an accident such as short circuit. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
