# Heat sensitive recording material.

## Abstract
This invention provides a heat sensitive recording mate rial comprising a base sheet and a heat sensitive record layer formed over the base sheet and containing a color forming material and a color developing material which undergoes a color forming reaction on contact with the color forming material, the heat sensitive recording material being char acterized in that a resin layer containing a cationic modified starch is formed over the heat sensitive record layer. The resin coated heat sensitive recording material of the invention is free of sticking, and resistant to diazo developer and suppresses the powder coated phenomenon due to the bleeding of crystallized color forming material, color de veloping material and the like.
