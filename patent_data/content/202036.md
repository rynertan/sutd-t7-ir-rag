# Method of and equipment for qualifying shock absorbers of a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of and equipment for qualifying shock absorbers of motor vehicles comprising the steps of placing the wheels of the vehicle on suitable supports, measuring the static contact force acting in standstill, imposing a forced constant amplitude sinusoidal vibration to, and exceeding the natural resonance frequency of the chassis, then removing this excitation and measuring the contact force in the function of changing frequency. Essential features of the method lie in checking the positioning of wheels before exciting said forced vibration, then when the frequency drops below natural frequency, one wheel is vibrated at natural frequency of the chassis by controlling the frequency of forced vibration to that value, and at that frequency the minimum contact force is measured, then the value characteristic of the applied shock absorber is determined from the static contact force and minimum contact force. The proposed equipment comprises a supporting member to transfer the vibratory motion to the wheel of the vehicle chassis, a force sensing unit coupled to said supporting member, an electronic measuring unit to receive the signals of the force sending unit and a unit to check proper adjustment of the pair of wheels, wherein the electronic measuring unit includes dynamometers 1 indicating the forces arising in the supporting member coupled to each unit of the pair of wheels, a control processor unit 4 to process the output signals of dynamometers, where the processor unit 4 , preferably a microprocessor, is coupled through a display unit 6 with a motor controller 5 connected to the motors 10 , 11 inducing vibrations in the respective supporting member.
