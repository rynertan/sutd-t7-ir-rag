## Description
System for interfacing remote functional units to a terminal unitThe present invention relates to a system for interfacing one or more remote functional units to a terminal unit utilizing a closed chamber as an inter unit optical communications link.Any data processing terminal device, ranging from a simple calculator to a complex point of sale terminal, can be viewed as a combination of functional units controllers, printers, displays, etc. , each of which has a dedicated function to perform as well as a need to exchange data and control signals at least some of the other functional units.Conventionally, the functional units have been linked through electrical wires, usually in the form of electrical cables. Cables have known disadvantages. Cables usually represent a significant portion of the component cost of a terminal device. The time and labor required to assemble terminal devices with electrical cables are also normally significant. Moreover, electrical cables are susceptible to electric noise or stray signals which can produce errors in the data or control signals being transmitted between functional units.To avoid some of these problems, proposals have been made that optical fibers be used to provide communications links between the functional units. Optical fibers are less susceptible to noise or stray signals than electrical cables, but cost more and are harder to work with during terminal assembly operations.To overcome some of the known problems of electrical or optical cables,U.S. Patent 4,063,083 discloses a system having between functional units an optical link in which a single beam of optical energy is transmitted along a straight path within a closed chamber from one pluggable card to the next. At each card the optical energy may be detected, modified and retransmitted to the next card along the path. Lenses are included for maintaining the beam focus. While the approach disclosed in the above mentioned patent avoids some of the problems inherent in the use of electrical or optical cables, certain other problems seem to be created. In fact, the terminal device would have to be carefully assembled to maintain the proper beam alignment. Also, the arrangement is somewhat inflexible in that the cards must be arranged in series along the beam path.The staightforward approach to interfacing remote functional units to the remainder of a closed chamber communications terminal would be to provide complete, self contained interface circuits for all of the remote funcional units. That is, each interface circuit would include both an optical emitter and an optical detector in communication with the optical chamber.There are, however, drawbacks to this traightforward approach. The cost of having complete, self contained interface circuits for all remote units would be high. Moreover, it would very likely be difficult to physically locate all of the necessary interface circuits in the optical chamber in locations in which optical signals could be received at suitable levels and in which one unit would not shade or partially block signal paths to one or more other remote functional units.The present invention relates to a system for interfacing one or more remote functional units to a terminal unit which also has one or more integrated functional units which communicate optically by means of signals propagated through ad optical closed chamber. The interface circuit uses a relatively few components and requires relatively little space within the optical chamber in order to perform its intended function.The interface system includes an optoelectronic transducer having a detector which responds to optical energy being propagated through the optical chamber to generate signals which are representative thereof. The transducer further includes an emitter which converts signals from the remote functional units to an optical form suitable for injection into the optical chamber. Signals generated by the detector are distributed to cables leading to each of the remote functional units. The interface system further includes means for concentrating signals received through any of the cables connecting the remote functional units to provide a single drive signal for the emitter in the optoelectronic transducer.One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail hereinafter with reference to drawings, in which Figure 1 is an exploded, perspective view of a terminal unit in which the present invention could be practiced Figure 2 is a simplified, rear perspective of such a terminal unit showing some of the details of the interface circuit s physical structure Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the signal distributing circuit Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of the distributor or emitter section of the interface circuit andFigure 5 is a schematic diagram of a concentrator of signals.The present invention pertains to a circuit for providing an interface between remote functional units and a terminal unit. A remote functiopal unit is considered to be any unit which is connected to the terminal unit through a signal carrying cable. Displays, bar code scanners, produce scales, etc., are examples of typical remote functional units for a.terminal unit used in a supermarket retail store environment.With reference to Figure 1, the terminal unit 11 includes a base Q with solid floor 12 and vertical sidewalls 14, 16, 18 and 20. A power distribution board 22 rests on the sidewalls of the base 10. The four sidewalls and floor of base 10, together with the bottom surface of powerdistribution board 22 define a closed optical chamber 13 which serves as the distribution medium for optical data and control signals. Details as to the manner in which the signals are distributed through the optical.chamber are provided later.The power distribution board 22 includes a plurality of power connectors, such as connector 24, and a plurality of optically transparent ports, such as opening 26. The connectors 24 are linked through a pattern of conductors 28 which distribute AC or DC voltages generated by a power supply not shown . The power distribution board 22 also carries the components required to interface remote units to the terminal unit 11. A more complete description of these components is proveded below.A frame 30 overlies the power distribution board 22 and rests directly on the base 10. Frame 30 includes a number of rectangular openings or bays for receiving largely self contained terminal functional units, such as terminal functional units 32. Each terminal functional unit which is plugged into one of the bays in frame 30 includes an optical transducer.The transducer includes a light emitting device which can inject optical energy directly into the optical chamber 13 through aligned openings in the power distribution board 22 and the frame 30. Openings 34 and 36 are examples of these aligned openings. Each terminal functional unit also includes a power connector which can be mated to one of the power connectors on power distribution board 22 through a rectangular opening in the floor of frame 30. Opening 38 is an example of such a rectangular opening.Figure 2 is a rear perspective view including the base 10 and the power distribution board 22. The interface circuit includes a circuit card 40 which includes a primary electrooptical transducer 42. The transducer 42 includes an optical detector 54 Figure 3 which responds to optical energy being propagated through the closed optical chamber 13 to generate an electrical signal which is representative of said optical energy. This electrical signal is distributed via a signal distributing circuit to each of several connectors 44 on the power distribution board 22. More details about the nature of this connection are provided later. The primary transducer 42 also includes a light emitting device 60 Figure 3 capable of injecting optical energy into the optical chamber. In a preferred embodiment, the light emitting device 60 in primary transducer 42 is driven by a single signal which is a logical OR of the signals received from all of the remote functional units Figure 5 .For purposes of illustration, only two remote functional units 46 and 48, are shown in Figure 2. The number of remote functional units which could be accomodated is limited only by the number of the connectors 44 available on the rear edge of the power distribution board 22. Each remote functional unit for example functional unit 48 is connected to the terminal unit through a signal carrying cable 50 having suitable connectors 52, 55 at each end. Preferably, each of the remote functional units 46 and 48 has an optical physical interface which allows that unit either to be plugged directly into the power distribution board 22 within the frame 30 Figure 1 or into the terminating connector 55 at one end of a signal carrying cable 50. The use of such a standardized interface allows a functional unit to be used either as an integral component of the terminal unit or as a remotely located component.Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of a preferred form of the signal distributing circuit between the optical chamber 13 and the remote functional units, such as units 46, 48. The primary optical transducer 42 mounted on circuit card 40 Figure 2 includes a single light detector 54 which detects optical energy being propagated through the optical chamber 13. The output of the light detector 54 modulates the current provided by a current source 56 to provide an electrical signal representative of the optical signal in the chamber 13. The modulated electrical signal is used to drive a plurality of emitters 43 associated with different secondary transducers 45 at the connector areas 44. The same signal is applied or broadcast to all of the emitters 43 of the secondary transducers 45 without regard to the identity ot the remote functional unit for whom the signal is ultimately intended. Each of these emitters 43 supplies the same signal to its associated remote funcional unit through the associated signal carrying cable 50.In one embodiment, the signal carrying cables 50 could be a fiber optic cables which would transmit the optical signals generated by the associated light emitter 43. Of course, it would be possible to eliminate any or all light emitters 43 in the secondary transducers 45 and to provide links through cables carrying electrical signals.Each of the secondary transducers 45 also includes a detector element 47 capable of detecting signals received from the associated remote functional unit. In the preferred embodiment, the detector 47 is responsive to optical signals transmitted through the associated signal carrying cable 50. The output of each of the detectors 47 is logically ORed at an input to an emitted driver circuit 58 which drives the single light emitter 60 of the primary transducer 42. The detectors 47 in the secondary transducers 45 and the emitter driver circuit 58 perform a concentrating function so that the primary transducer 42 is driven by a single signal regardless of the number of remote functional units which are attached to the terminal. Thus, all remote functional units interface with the optical chamber 13 through a single primary transducer 42.Figure 3 indicates that modulated current provided by current source 56 is supplied to each of the secondary transducer emitters 43 in series. Figure 4 shows a preferred form of this circuit. The output of light detector 54 controls a shunt transistor 62 which is connected in parallel with the series of secondary transducer emitters 43. Each secondary transducer emitter 43 includes a Zener diode 64 shunting a light emitting diode 66.The light emitting diode 66 in each such circuit may be connected permanently in parallel with the associated Zener diode 64. There are, however, advantages to having the light emitting diode 66 provided as an integral part of the connector 52 at the terminal end of the signal carrying cable 50. The possible physical incorporation of the light emitting diode 66 into the cable connector structure is represented by the symbols 68.In an arrangement of the type described in Figure 4, the voltage drop across a light emitting diode 66 is normally small enough to allow the associated Zener diode 64 to appear as an open circuit. If, however, a light emitting diode 66 fails in an open circuit mode or is removed, for example by unplugging the cable, full voltage proveded by source 56 will be imposed across the associated Zener diode 64, causing the Zener diode to break down and supply the full current to the remaining light emitting diodes 66 in the series circuit. Thus, the removal or failure of one of the light emitting diodes 66 does not affect the remaining light emitting diodes in series therewith.Shunt transistor 62 acts as a simple signal modulator for the current provided by source 56. If the signal supplied by light detector 54 to the base of shunt transistor 62 is high enough, the transistor switches into a conductive state and current provided by source 56 is diverted directly to ground in this case the light emitting diodes 66 would be shut off. If the detector signal is low, shunt transistor 62 is non conductive and current supplied by source 56 flows along the series current path through each of the light emitting diodes 66. The combination of the current source 56, the transistor 62 and the individual light emitting diode 66 provides a broadcast function that is, a single signal detected in the optical chamber is broadcast to all attached remote functional units.Figure 5 is one embodiment of circuitry capable of concentrating signals received from the functional units. This concentrator circuitry includes a current source 70 and one or more switching transistor 72 connected in parallel with a light emitting diode 74 and a carrier dissipating diode 76.The base drive signal for the transistor 72 is provided by an OR NOT gate 78 having multiple inputs from the detectors 47 receiving signals from the remote functional units. If any functional unit provides a high level signal, transistor 72 is biased into a non conductive state and current is supplied to the light emitting diode 74 which emits light into the closed optical chamber 13. Obviously, it is possible for more than one functional unit to provide a drive signal at any given time to avoid garbled, overlapping signals, the machine architecture and programming has to establish certain protocols which assure that only one functional unit provides a responsive signal at a time. The establishment of such protocols, however, is beyond the scope of the present invention. For maximum flexibility in locating remote functional units, necessary AC or DC voltages could be provided through the cables 50 to the remote functional units using separate electrical conductors from the data control signal conductors in the cable.
