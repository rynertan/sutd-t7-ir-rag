# Fluid dispensing device.

## Abstract
A three piece nozzle is disclosed, for fitment to a hand actuated liquid pump having a barrel portion 20 with a bore 22 therethrough for passage of liquid. The nozzle features an integrally formed nozzle cap 18 which fits around the end portion of the barrel. Enclosed within the nozzle cap is an integrally formed nozzle seal 38 which forms a peripheral liquid tight seal around the barrel between the nozzle cap and the barrel. Also pro vided is an integrally formed check valve 46 which is movably positioned at the mouth of the bore and which is biased towards the mouth of the bore to form a liquid tight bore seal. The bias is overcome, to open the liquid tight bore seal, upon actuation of the pump which pro vides liquid pressure in the bore to act against the check valve.
