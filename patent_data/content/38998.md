# Electronic and hydraulic control system for automatic gear change transmission.

## Abstract
A manual selector valve 350 , whose setting is controlled by the vehicle operator, distributes flow from a fluid pump to an ON OFF valve 300 and to a hydraulic clutch 36 which on being engaged disposes the transmission for forward drive. Two ON OFF valves 270 and 300 act as pressure distributors and enable the manual valve 350 to overrule the operation of the automatic shift valves. The state of two solenoid actuated valves 180 and 220 is determined by an electrical signal received from a microprocessor that receives operational information and has stored within its memory logic that con trols the signals. If the electronic control system should fail, the state of the solenoid valves 180 and 220 is determined hydraulically and mechanically thus permitting complete functional response as the operator manually displaces the selector valve 350 . A variable force solenoid actuates a line pressure regulator valve 104 , which cooperates with a sol enoid pressure regulator valve 130 to reduce line pressure. A pressure modulator valve 150 directs manual valve outlet flow to the solenoid valves 180 and 220 which function as shift valves.
