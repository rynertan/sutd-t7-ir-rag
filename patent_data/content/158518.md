# Process and accompanying catalysts for the hydroformylation of formaldehyde to glycol aldehyde.

## Abstract
A process end accompanying catalyst for the hydrofor mylation of formaldehyde to glycol aldehyde is disclosed. The process features the utilization of 1 a class of transition metal phosphine amide complexes, 2 a class of transition metal phosphine amine complexes, and 3 mixtures of 1 and 2 as particularly suitable for use.
