## Description
One goal of genetic engineering research has been the development of methods for the production in microorganisms of proteins produced naturally only in higher organisms. This goal has been achieved with respect to certain eucaryotic growth hormones or analogs thereof. Strains of genetically modified bacteria, e.g. The production of a growth hormone by a microorganism involves the following general steps 1 foreign DNA encoded with the genetic instructions for the production of desired hormone is inserted into an appropriate microorganism, such as Recovery and purification of the hormone generally involves disrupting the cell, separating the growth hormone from other cellular components and further purifying the recovered hormone. Undesired cellular constituents may be digested with enzymes, solubilized with surfactants and separated from the hormone by centrifugation. Finally, the growth hormone can be purified to a varying degree by a variety of techniques which have been developed for the purification of proteins in general. Such techniques include one or more of the following dialysis, zonal centrifugation, molecular exclusion chromatography, isoelectric precipitation, salting in and salting out, solvent fractionation, electrophoretic methods, ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. These methods vary among themselves both with regard to economic feasibility and the degree of purification achievable. Pending co assigned U.S. patent application Serial No. 514,188, filed July 15, 1983, describes a recovery and purification method for bovine growth hormone. That method involves recovering the hormone by mechanically disrupting a blended cell suspension and incubating the precipitate with lysozyme and then with deoxyribonuclease. The hormone is then purified by sonicating the solubilized hormone, clarifying the solution by centrifugation and subjecting the solution containing the hormone to gel chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, dialysis and lyophilization. The preceding method requires rather large amounts of lysozyme and entails repeated and time consuming washes in order to yield purified hormone, and even then in only a relatively low yield about 10 15 based on the weight of the hormone in the cells at the end of fermentation . The preceding method suffers another disadvantage owing to its reliance on deoxyribonuclease digestion. Deoxyribonuclease is an expensive enzyme that has been used to digest cellular DNA during the hormone recovery process. Preparations of deoxyribonuclease have been found to be contaminated with proteases which degrade the desired product during recovery. Use of deoxyribonuclease as in the preceding method may thus reduce the yield of recovered hormone unless additional precautionary steps are taken to inhibit any protease present. Even then, complete inhibition of protease may not be possible. In addition to reducing the product yield, the use of deoxyribonuclease also leads to a product of less than desirable stability, because of protease contamination. A method for recovering a purified eucaryotic growth hormone or analog thereof has now been developed which is easier to perform, better controlled and less expensive than previous methods. The method of this invention results in the recovery of the desired product in higher yield and in a more stable form than was previously obtainable. The method requires only 2.5 5 of the amount of lysozyme used in the previous method, thereby facilitating purification and reducing the cost of recovery. Moreover, the method does not require the use of any deoxyribonuclease. In addition to further reducing the cost of recovery, eliminating the need for deoxyribonuclease more than doubles the yield of product and affords the product in significantly more stable form. Furthermore, by reducing the number of washings required this method affords a more convenient and time efficient process for recovery of purified growth hormones or analogs, taking only 10 to 20 of the time of the previous method. By utilizing ultrafiltration, the method achieves both a significant reduction in cost and improved product purity. EP A 0 114 506 discloses a means for enhancing the amount of protein precipitated in refractile bodies, and further discloses a method of isolating active enzyme from the refractile bodies by solubilization in a strong chemical denaturant followed by further purification and renaturation steps. This invention concerns a method for recovering a purified animal or human growth hormone or a polypeptide analog thereof from a bacterial cell in which the eucaryotic growth hormone or analog has been produced by means of expression of a DNA sequence encoding the hormone or analog which comprises the following steps Lysozyme may be employed in step d to treat the suspension of the precipitate separated from the lysate before liquid solids contact and subsequent precipitate separation. The latter two steps as well as ultrafiltration may be repeated. Ion exchange chromatography may be employed in step h to further purify and concentrate the hormone or analog. Additionally, most of the process steps may be performed in a continuous flow and may be automated. Suitable hormone producing bacterial cells for use in this invention include A new method has been developed for recovering a purified eucaryotic, e.g. animal or human growth hormone or an analog thereof from a bacterial cell in which the growth hormone or analog has been produced by means or expression of a DNA sequence encoding the hormone or analog. Genetically modified bacterial cells for use in this method are known. A strain of This method is easier to perform, better controlled and less expensive than previous methods and results in the recovery of the desired product in higher yield and in a more stable form. Such products may be recovered by this method in yields in excess of 25 or even 30 by weight based on the weight of the hormone or analog present in the bacteria at the end of fermentation. Lysozyme is utilized in lesser amounts of the enzyme than required in previous methods. Also the method does not require the use of any deoxyribonuclease, may be performed in a continuous flow manner and may be conveniently automated. In accordance with this method, after the growth, induction and harvest of appropriate bacterial cells the decanted bacterial cells, fragments thereof or cell cake are suspended in a suitable buffered solution at a neutral pH, e.g. a pH of about 7.4. A suitable suspension medium for this purpose is an aqueous solution of 50mM Tris pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl, 50mM Tris pH 7.4 50mM EDTA, 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 50mM NaCl or 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 50mM EDTA. Alternatively, the fermentation mash cell suspension, after adjusting its pH to a neutral pH, may be used directly. The cell wall of the suspended bacterial cell or fragments thereof is then disrupted to produce a lysate. In a preferred embodiment, the cells are mechanically disrupted at temperatures less than about 35 A precipitate containing particulate and insoluble material including the hormone or analog and other water insoluble proteins as well as cell membrane and cell wall fragments and aggregates is then separated from the lysate which also contains water soluble proteins, DNA and RNA or fragments thereof. To effect this separation, the lysate is preferably diluted with a suitable amount, e.g. an approximately equal volume, of deionized water and then centrifuged in a solid bowl continuous flow centrifuge e.g. Cepa 101 at flow rates sufficient to effect the desired separation, e.g. about 60 80 L hr. A suspension is then prepared of the separated precipitate in a suitable amount of an appropriate buffer solution having a neutral pH, e.g. a pH of about 7.4. Preferably the solution contains 50 mM Tris or sodium phosphate pH 7.4 50 mM EDTA. A suitable amount of buffer solution for the suspension is about 0.5 2.5 liters per Kg of initial bacterial cells, preferably about 1.2 liters per Kg of cells. Undesirable cellular material such as cell wall fragments may then be digested by incubating the suspension with an appropriate enzyme capable of digesting polysaccharides present in the suspension, e.g. lysozyme Sigma L 6876, St. Louis, MO , under suitable conditions and for a suitable period of time. The presently preferred concentration of lysozyme is about 50 100µg per ml of solution, a significant reduction from the 2 mg ml used in previous methods. An appropriate period of time for the lysozyme incubation is between about one and 20 hours. The temperature during this incubation period is preferably maintained at about 37 The liquid and solids contained in the suspension are then treated so as to effect intimate liquid solids contact, for example, by sonication under suitable conditions, such as with a 370W continuous flow sonicator Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Plainview, NY set at 65 of maximum power and with a flow rate of about 18 L hr to 25 L hr. Precipitated material is then separated from the liquid solids contacted suspension, preferably by centrifuging the liquid solids contacted suspension in a solid bowl continuous flow centrifuge e.g. Cepa 101 at an appropriate flow rate e.g. about 30 L hr. In another embodiment, the separation in this and subsequent steps may be effected by microfiltration with an appropriate membrane, e.g. a Millipore Durapore 0.45 micron membrane instead of centrifugation. After the separation, the precipitated material separated from the liquid solids contacted, e.g. sonicated, suspension may be washed, suitably with 50 mM Tris or phosphate pH 7.4 100 mM NaCl, and resuspended in a suitable amount of an appropriate medium, e.g. a buffered or unbuffered aqueous solution. The suspension so prepared is then brought into liquid solids contact, such as through sonication, under suitable conditions, and the resultant precipitated material is partially or completely separated from the liquid solids contacted, e.g. sonicated, suspension, e.g. by centrifugation or ultrafiltration as above. The re suspending liquid solids contacting e.g. sonicating and separating are preferably carried out at least one additional time. In an especially preferred embodiment these steps are performed four times as follows the resultant precipitate is first re suspended in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 or 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and the suspension liquid solids contacted e.g. sonicated as above. The suspension is then centrifuged as above and the recovered precipitate re suspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 100 mM NaCl or 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 10 mM EDTA 100 mM NaCl. This suspension is then liquid solids contacted, such as by sonication, and centrifuged as above and the recovered precipitate resuspended in deionized water. The water suspension is liquid solids contacted, e.g. sonicated and centrifuged, again as above, and the recovered precipitate is again suspended in deionized water. This second water suspension is then liquid solids contacted, e.g. sonicated and centrifuged as above to yield a precipitate enriched in the desired hormone or analog. The separated precipitate is then solubilized, for example, by resuspending the precipitate, at an appropriate temperature, e.g. 4 40 An appropriate amount of a suitably concentrated aqueous solution of sodium borate, e.g. about 1M an appropriate pH, e.g. 11.5 12.0 , is then added to the solution to achieve a final borate concentration preferably of about 10 mM. The protein solution is then titrated to pH 10.5 either by its dilution with 2 10 volumes of 10 mM sodium borate buffer pH 10.2 or by titration with concentrated HCl or 1N HCl. The solution is then further incubated for 1 12 hours with stirring. The solution so obtained may be clarified if desired by sonicating the solution under appropriate conditions, e.g. with a continuous flow Heat System Sonicator Model 370 at a flow rate of about 10 L hr centrifuging the sonicated solution under suitable conditions, e.g. with a solid bowl continuous flow centrifuge e.g. Cepa 101 at a flow rate of about 30 L hr separating the supernatant liquid and vacuum filtering the liquid, e.g. through a Whatman No. 2 paper on a Buchner vacuum filter to produce a clarified solution containing the solubilized hormone or analog. Alternatively, centrifuging may be employed exclusively. The solubilized hormone or analog is then separated from other cellular components such as proteins, lipids and other particles, and aggregates are dissociated by ultrafiltration under suitable conditions. Preferably, the retentate obtained is resubjected to ultrafiltration at least once. During this procedure, the volume of the retentate should be reduced by about 95 , e.g., from about 10 liters to about 0.5 liters and the filtrate collected. A Pellicon Cassette or PUF 100 spiral Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA with a 100K M.W. cut off is suitable for use in the ultrafiltration procedure. Preferably the retentate is further diluted with a suitable buffer at an appropriate alkaline pH, e.g. about 9 12, and subjected to further ultrafiltration. In a presently preferred embodiment, 10 mM borate buffer pH 10.5 12.0 is used. Redilution and reconcentration by ultrafiltration is preferably repeated at least once. Alternately, the ultrafiltration may be effected one or more times at substantially constant retentate volume. In an especially preferred embodiment, ultrafiltration is repeated until the absorbance of the retentate at 280 nanometers is less than about 0.1 optical density units. The hormone may be conveniently obtained from the ultrafiltrate at a level of purity and biological activity superior to that obtained previously by gel chromatography. The purified hormone or analog obtained in the ultrafiltrate is then treated, such as by ion exchange chromatography, e.g. with an amine containing ion exchange resin such as diethylaminoethyl, so as to further purify and concentrate the hormone or analog and recover the purified hormone or analog. Concentration of the ultrafiltration using a 10K M.W. membrane to remove water is optional prior to ion exchange chromatography. During the ion exchange chromatography step remaining DNA, lysozyme if present and multimers are separated from the hormone or analog. In this step the pH of the ultrafiltrate is first adjusted to a suitable pH, e.g. pH 9.0, by titrating with hydrochloric acid, and is loaded on a suitable ion exchange column, e.g. a DEAE Sepharose CL 6B fast flow KS 370 sectional column Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ . The system is then washed with a suitable buffer, e.g. 10 mM borate buffer, and the sample eluted at a suitable rate with an appropriate eluent, e.g. 10 mM borate buffer pH 9.0 containing 100 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the hormone or analog may be concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Pellicon Cassette or PUF 100 spiral with a 10K M.W. cut off and may then be dialyzed against a solution containing a suitable concentration of an appropriate salt, e.g. 3 mM ammonium hydroxide or ammonium bicarbonate, again using a 10K M.W. cut off Pellicon Cassette. The dialyzed material may then be dried by lyophilization or by spray drying under appropriate conditions. Spray drying is the more economical process and may be conveniently accomplished in a minor spray dryer Niro Atomyzer using an inlet temperature of about 200 Purified animal growth hormones or analogs may be recovered by this method in yields greater than or equal to about 30 based on the weight of the hormone or analog present in the bacteria at the end of fermentation. The hormone or analog so obtained appears as one spot when developed on 15 polyacrylamide SDS gel against low molecular weight size markers Pharmacia as a reference. The peptides obtained after ultrafiltration and ion exchange chromatography according to this invention were purer and more stable than when gel chromatography was used in place of ultrafiltration or when concentration of the peptides was performed with a 10K M.W. ultrafiltration in place of ion exchange chromatography. With regard to biological activity of the hormones and analogs recovered, radioimmunoassay results indicate that antibodies to the natural hormone had approximately equal affinities to the hormone or analog produced by the appropriate microorganism and recovered in accordance with this invention. Similarly, radioreceptor binding assays indicate binding activity of appropriate membranes toward the hormones or analogs purified by the present invention equivalent to that toward authentic samples of the natural hormones. Moreover, no antibodies to the hormones or analogs were detected following either primary or booster injections of the peptides into appropriate animals. Furthermore, the bovine growth hormone analog was found to increase lactation when administered to lactating cows. The examples which follow are set forth to aid in understanding the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed as to, limit its scope in any way. The examples do not include detailed descriptions for conventional methods which are well known to those skilled in the art.

The cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 RPM 16,000 xg on a CEPA 101 tubular bowl centrifuge at a feed rate of 250 liters hr. The CEPA 101 centrifuge had a tube length of 73.7 cm, a radius to the discharge dam of 3.25 cm and a radius to the bowl wall of 7.35 cm. It was equipped with acceleration fins and had cooling on the exterior jacket. The clear supernatant had a density of 1.0 g ml, contained no detectable bGH and was discarded. The cake, weighing 11.4 kg 75 wet , contains the aggregated bGH and was saved. The cake was typically about 2 cm in thickness with a density of 1.1 g ml. An alternative procedure is to allow the cells to settle overnight and siphon off the clear supernatant.

A Polytron high shear mixer Kinematica aids in dispersing the cake. The suspended cells were fed into Dynomill KD 5 bead mill disrupter Willy A. Bachofen, Basel at 80 L hr. The bead mill was maintained at 10 6.06 g Tris and 2.97 g NaCl in 750 mL deionized water was adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated HCl, diluted to 1 L with deionized water, and if necessary readjusted to pH 7.4.

The cake, weighing, 2.46 kg 75 wet , contains the aggregated bGH and was saved. 2.42 g Tris in 750 mL deionized water was adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated HCl, diluted to 1 L with deionized water, and readjusted to pH 7.4, if necessary. The wet cake 2.46 kg from the first wash step Example 5 was suspended in 0.6 liters of 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 7.4 for each kilogram of original wet cells harvested total of 6.8 liters . A Polytron high shear mixer aids in dispersing the cake. The slurry was sonicated at a flow rate of 18 L hr through the Heat Systems 370 watt model at 65 power.

A Polytron high shear mixer aids in dispersing the cake. The slurry was sonicated at a flow rate of 18 L hr through the Heat Systems 370 watt model at 65 power. The slurry pH should increase from the starting water pH of about 6.2 to about pH 7.8 8.0 The sonicated slurry was then centrifuged on the CEPA 101 at a flow rate of 30 L hr. All centrifugation conditions except feed rate were identical to those of cell harvesting. The supernatant was discarded. The cake, weighing 1.90 kg 75 wet , contains the aggregated bGH and was saved.

A Polytron high shear mixer aids in dispersing the cake. The slurry pH should be about 8.4. The slurry was sonicated at a flow rate of 18 L hr through the Heat Systems 370 watt model at 65 power. The sonicated slurry was then centrifuged on the CEPA 101 at a flow rate of 30 L hr. All centrifugation conditions except feed rate were identical to those of cell harvesting. The supernatant was discarded. The cake, weighing 1.31 kg 75 wet , contains the aggregated bGH and was saved. The wet cake 1.31 kg from the second water wash Example 8 was suspended in 25 liters of deionized pyrogen free water for each kilogram of washed cake total of 32.6 liters . A Polytron high shear mixer aids in dispersing the cake. The pH was adjusted slowly to 11.8 by addition of 10N NaOH. The aggregated bGH dissolved slowly over a period of one hour. After the one hour incubation period, 1M sodium borate at pH 11.8 was added to the solution to make the final solution 10 mM in sodium borate. The solution was held for 30 minutes before sonication through the Heat System 370 watt model at 65 power. The feed rate to the sonicator was 18 L hr. If the solution was very hazy, it was centrifuged at 30 L hr through the CEPA 101 otherwise, the solution was filtered in 5 L portions through three 24 cm diameter Whatman No. 2 papers in a single Buchner filter. The vacuum was adjusted to prevent foaming during filtration. There was only a trace of insoluble material. The filtrate 32.6 L contains the bGH in solution. The absorbance of the clarified solution was 9.1 O.D. at 280 nm 1 cm cell . If all the absorption were due to bGH, which it is not, this would correspond to 14.3 g bGH L. The true bGH content is less than half of this value. UV absorbing impurities account for the difference. An absorbance of 1.0 at 280 nm 1 cm cell is given by a 1.57 g l solution of pure bGH at pH 9. The absorbance of bGH changes with pH . Dissolve 61.8 grams boric acid in 750 ml deionized water and adjust to pH 11.8 with 50 NaOH. Dilute to a final volume of 1 liter with deionized water. The clarified protein solution 32.6 liters, 297,000 OD Example 9 was divided into separate portions 6 x 5.4 liters each having an absorbance of 50,000 60,000 OD. Each portion was ultrafiltrated separately through a Pellicon Cassette System ultrafilter Millipore, Bedford, MA equipped with three 100,000 molecular weight cutoff cassettes type PTHK of 5 ft² area each. The first portion was concentrated to 1 L retentate volume. The ultrafiltrate was collected, assayed by UV, and saved. The retentate was diluted to its original volume with fresh 10 mM sodium borate buffer at pH 11.8 and mixed well. The batch was concentrated again to 1 L retentate volume. The ultrafiltrate was collected and combined with the first ultrafiltrate. When a running total of the OD absorbance in the ultrafiltrates equaled 20 of the OD absorbance of the initial charge to the ultrafilter, the retentate volume on the next concentration was taken to 0.5 L instead of 1 L. The cycle of concentration and dilution with 10 mM sodium borate buffer was continued until the ultrafiltrate from a retentate volume of 0.5 L had an absorbance at 280 nm 1 cm cell of less than 0.1. This normally takes between 9 and 12 cycles of ultrafiltration and dilution. The final retentate was discarded. Flow rates for the ultrafiltration are shown in Table 1. All ultrafiltrates were then combined and adjusted to pH 9.0 with 6N HCl. The other 5.4 L portions were processed through the Pellicon System in a similar fashion, and all pH adjusted ultrafiltrates were combined. A typical run produced a total of 380 liters of ultrafiltrate with an absorbance of 0.26 OD ml, equivalent to a total OD value of 100,000 pH 12 and required 24 to 40 hours to complete. Assay methods Quantitated gel scan on input and absorbance at 280 nm 1 cm cell on output qualitative gel chromatography The conditions of the gel column are Prepared as described in Example 9. The combined ultrafiltrates 380 liters, with an absorbance of 100,000 OD from the 100K ultrafiltration of Example 10 were loaded onto a Sepharose CL 6B DEAE ion exchange column Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ at a linear flow velocity of 93 cm hr 100 L hr . The 37 cm diameter, 15 cm high column was washed with two bed volumes 32 L of 10 mM sodium borate buffer at pH 9.0, and the eluate from the loading and washing steps discarded. A step change in eluent to 10 mM sodium borate 100mM sodium chloride at pH 9 displaced the bGH from the column. The elution flow velocity was 93 cm hr. The progress of the elution was monitored by following the absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm. The bGH peak was collected in 4 to 5 bed volumes 84 liters with a total absorbance of 43,000 OD and saved. The average concentration of the bGH fraction was 0.8 g bGH L. The column was regenerated by washing the bed at a velocity of 93 cm hr as follows one bed volume of 1M sodium acetate adjusted to pH 3.0 with HCl was applied to the column followed by one and one half bed volumes 0.5 0.62 g boric acid in 750 mL deionized water was adjusted to pH 10 with concentrated HCl, diluted to 1 L with deionized water and, if necessary, readjusted to pH 9.0. 3.81 g sodium borate decahydrate and 5.85 g sodium chloride in 750 mL deionized water was adjusted to pH 9.0 with concentrated HCl, diluted to 1 L with deionized water and, if necessary, readjusted to pH 9.0. 136.09 g sodium acetate 3H₂O in 750 ml deionized water was adjusted to pH 3.0 with concentrated HCl, diluted to 1 L with deionized water and, if necessary, readjusted to pH 3.0. The bGH fraction from the ion exchange step 84 liters, 43,000 OD Example 11 was adjusted to pH 10.5 with 1N NaOH. The adjusted solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration through a Millipore Pellicon ultrafilter equipped with three 10,000 molecular weight cutoff cassettes type PTGC of 5 ft² each until the calculated absorbance at 280 nm 1 cm cell of the retentate is 10. The ultrafiltrate should contain no bGH and was discarded. The retentate was usually concentrated by a factor of roughly 20 4.2 liters of retentate . Flow rates are shown in Table 2. After the bGH had been concentrated, the solution was desalted by dialysis against NH₄OH using the Pellicon System with the 10K M.W. cutoff cassette diafiltration . 3 mM NH₄OH solution 25 volumes per volume of retentate or 105 liters 3 mM NH₄OH in this case was continuously added to the retentate at a rate just sufficient to make up for the volume loss by diafiltration. The diafiltrate was then discarded. It contains salts and 10 of the input bGH as measured by absorbance. The retentate containing the desalted bGH is drained from the Pellicon Sytem, and the ultrafilter was washed with a small amount of 3 mM NH₄OH which is combined with the retentate. The retentate volume before addition of the wash was 4.2 liters 39,000 OD at a concentration of 14.6 g bGH L. Flow rates are shown in Table 3. Assay method Absorbance at 280 nm 1 cell The retentate and wash from the dialysis step 4.2 liters, 39,000 OD at a concentration of 14.6 g bGH L was shell frozen in a tall glass jar. The jar was connected to a lab freeze dryer for 24 to 48 hours until the contents were lyophilized to dryness. The outer surface of the jar was exposed to ambient temperature throughout the drying cycle. There was no detectable loss of bGH. The bGH 61.3 g was harvested as a fluffy, white powder.
