## Description
Electrically Operated Diaphragm ValveThis invention concerns an electrically operated diaphragm valve, especially for use with washing machines, comprising a housing made of plastic that encloses a diaphragm and a valve seat cooperating therewith, and that is provided with a water inlet as well as with a water outlet that is in communication with the valve seat and to which is welded, by means of ultrasonic, an armature guide which tightly holds the membrane diaphragm in the housing and which is also provided with a ferromagnetic armature which is biased in the direction of the diaphragm and which is movable in the longitudinal direction plus a magnetic coil that is placed outside and concentrically on the armature guide and is clamped inplace by means of a snap connection which magnetic coil has, extending a right angles to its axis, electrical contacts which are partially enclosed by a ferromagnetib yoke defining an internal air gap in the region of the armature.The industry is familiar with such a valve whose magnetic coil, however, is expensive to produce.DE OS 2 800 204 describes an electrically operated diaphragm valve whose magnetic yoke comprises two tube sections, each provided with a flange, which can be introduced into the coil form of the magnetic coil from opposite sides. Thereupon, the winding is placed on the coil form and over this coil form is slid a C shaped ferromagnetic profile piece so that the tube sections, which define an air gap inside the magnetic coil, are magnetically connected. Subsequently, the magnetic coil which is now provided with a magnetic return path yoke is embedded in plastic material.In the case of this well known diaphragm valve, high accuracy requirements are demanded in respect to the C shaped profile and the axial distance of the flanges of the two tube sections, in order to ensure that neither the C shaped profile piece becomes widened when it is slid on and thus causing a wedge shaped additional air gap nor that the inside width of the C shaped profilepiece becomes larger than the distance between the flanges,which would also resultin an additional air gap.The invention has the objective of yielding an electrically operated diaphragm valve that can be mass produced as a cost effective and rugged product and whose magnetic return path for the sealed magnetic coil can be subsequently assembled, thereby making only modest demands in respect to mechanical tolerances while a low magnetic resistance is maintained.To solve this problem the electrically operated diaphragm valve of the invention was created whose characteristics are given in patent claim 1.Since the magnetic return path yoke comprises two congruent parts, bent in L shape, the manufacture of the individual parts is simplified. Furthermore, since a tube is attached to each part, it is possible to assemble the yoke with the already sealed magnetic coil, the tubes fitted into the armature bore holding the magnetic yoke on the magnetic coil.If the abutting leg ends of the two parts are adapted to be interlocked with each other a very rigid structure will result, especially since the parts will also be positively held together in a locked position in the axial direction. Very simple conditions are obtained when one leg end of one part is provided with a protrusion and the corresponding other leg end of the other part is provided with a corresponding and matching recess. In that case, the protrusion and recess can be so shaped that they yield a mechanically rigid dovetail connection.Furthermore, it is possible that both parts of the magnetic return path yoke are held together by means of the armature guide of the diaphragm valve.The drawings depict an embodiment of the subject matter of this invention Shown are In Figure 1 an electrically operated diaphragm valve persuant to this invention, in a longitudinal sectional view and in Figure 2 the magnetic coil as well as both parts of the magnetic yoke for the diaphragm valve shown in Figure 1, in a perspective explosive view. The electrically operated diaphragm valve 1 comprises a housing 2 made of plastic material integral with a water inlet 3 as well as with a water outlet 4.The water inlet 3 is in the form a threaded fitting that encloses an internal water screen 5 als well as a choke port 6. By means of a flange 7 that is slid on the water inlet 3, the diaphragm valve 1 can be attached to a washing machine.The water outlet 4 is in the form of a nipple and is in communication, in the interior of the housing 2, with a valve seat 8 that is upwardly directed and on which rests a circular membrane 9 that is attached to the housing 2. In this membrane 9 a concentrical membrane plate 10 is provided which has a concentrical bore 11. Laterally adjoining the valve seat 8, the membrane 9 is provided with a compensating bore 12 which also passes through the membrane plate 10.Above the membrane 9, there is located, within the housing 2, an armature guide 13, comprising a somewhat disk shaped section 14 as well as a tube shaped section 15 that is concentrically located relative to section 14. The upper end of this section 15, that is opposite the disk shaped section 14, is sealed off. The armature guide 13 firmly clamps the membrane 9 to the housing 2. It is attached to the housing 2 by ultrasonic or rotary friction welding. In the armature guide 13 a ferromagnetic armature 16 is provided whidh can be shifted longitudinally, and which carries on its front end an elastic closure member 17 by which means the bore 11 in the membrane plate 10 can be sealed. By means of a spring, 18 provided inside the armature guide 13, the armature 16 is biased in the direction towards the membrane 9. On the outside of the tube shaped section 15 of the armature guide 13, a magnetic coil 19 is located which is provided with a wire winding 21 supported by a coil form spool 20. In the core form 20 two plugs, 22a and 22b are provided, extending roughly radially in respect to the magnetic coil 19. In the sectional view of Figure 1, only plug 22b is visible. The winding 21 and the coil form 20 are encased in a plastic sealing material 23 on the ends of the magnetic coil protrusions 24 and 25 are formed by the sealing material one of these protrusions is engaging a corresponding recess in the disk shaped section 14 of the armature guide 13thus fixing the magnetic coil 19 unrotatably in respect to the housing 2 of the diaphragm valve. Between the inner surface of the magnetic coil 19, which is concentrically supported on the armature guide 13, and the outer surface of the tube shaped section 15 are located two tubes 26 and 27 of a magnetic return path or yoke 28. These tubes define, in the region of the armature 16, an air gap 29 which is the operational air gap of the diaphragm valve.The magnetic coil 19, assembled with the asspciated magnetic yoke 28, is secured to the tube section 15 by means of clamping fingers 30 which are provided on the top end of the armature guide 13 and are facing outwardly therefrom.The magnetic yoke 28 comprises two parts 31 a and 31b, each bent in L shape. Each of these L shaped parts 31a and 31b is supporting on one leg 32a, respectively 32b, the tube 26, respectively 27, which extends in the direction of the other leg 33a, respectively 33b, and which when the valve is assembled such as depicted in Figure 1 is mounted on the tube shaped section 15.The leg 32a, respectively 32b, which carries the tube 26, respectively 27, is provided along its free leg end 34a, respectively 34b, with a protrusion 35a, respectively 35b, which fits into a corresponding recess 36a, respectively 36b, of the free end of the leg 37a, respectively 37b, of the leg 33a, respectively 33b.The protrusion 35a, respectively 35b, forms together with the recess 36a, respectively 36b, a dovetail juntion which effectively prevents an axial disengagement of the parts 31a and 32be In manufacturing the valve, the coil 21 is first wound onto the coil form ZQ and subsequently the preassembled magnetic coil 19 is encased or sealed in the coating envelope 23.Thereupon, the tubes 26 and 27 of the parts 31a and 31b of the magnetic yoke 28 are inserted into the magnetic coil 19 while the legs 33a and 33b are sumultaneously slihtly urged outwardly so that the recess 36b of the free end of leg 37 can slide over the protrusion 35a of the free end of leg 34 and, on the opposite front side of the magnetic coil, the recess 36a can slide over the protrusion 34b. As soon as the legs 33a and 33b are released, the recesses 36a and 36b slide onto the associated protrusions 35a and 35b. The thus assembled magnetic coil 19 with the magnetic yoke 28 is placed onto the tube section 15 of the armature guide and held by means of the clamping fingers 30.Instead of securing the two parts 31a and 31b of the magnetic yoke 28 to each other by means of a dovetail connection, it is also possible to hold them together by means of the securing means, such as the clamping fingers 30 and the diskshaped section 14, effective between the magnetic coil and the tube section 15.Because of the symmetrical design of the two end sides of the magnetic coil 19 it is possible to mount the coil on the armature guide 13 with the plugs on top or on the bottom, whichever is preferred. when during the operation of the diaphragm valve 1 the magnetic coil 19 is deenergized, the spring 18 will press the armature 16 onto the bore 11 in the membrane plate 10 so that on the topside of the membrane 9 through the compensating bore 12 a pressure will build up which will press the membrane 9, together with the membrane plate 10, onto the valve seat 8. When the magnetic coil 19 is energized, the armature 16 will be lifted against the bias of spring 18 so that the pressure now acting on membrane 9 will be reduced through bore 19 and the input pressure of the water will lift the membrane off the valve seat 8 and the water can flow into the washing machine via the water inlet 3 and the water outlet 4.
