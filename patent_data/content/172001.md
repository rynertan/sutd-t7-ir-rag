# Improved spinning process for aromatic polyamide filaments.

## Abstract
Process for producing high strength, aromatic polyamide filaments by delivering substantially uniform amounts of a spinning solution to a plurality of apertures in a spinneret plate, extruding the solution downwardly in a single vertical warp through a noncoagulating fluid and into a gravity accelerated and free falling coagulating fluid.
