# Determination of monomer conversion by headspace analysis.

## Abstract
Method for determining monomer conversion in the liquid phase py analyzing vapor phase above a polymeriza tion mixture comprising measuring temperature of the vapor phase, analyzing the vapor phase with a gas chromatograph provided with a flame ionization detector to determine relative amount of a certain monomer in the vapor phase, correlating initial amount of the monomer with an intermedi ate amount of the monomer adjusted by applying a tempera ture correction, and determining monomer conversion on the basis of an essentially linear relationship of conversion in the liquid phase with relative amount of the monomer in the vapor phase.
