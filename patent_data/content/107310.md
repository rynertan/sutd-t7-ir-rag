# Production of a purified aluminum monochloride from alumina, bauxites and clays and the subsequent production of aluminum metal.

## Abstract
In the production of aluminum monochloride from alu mina, bauxites, bauxitic clays and clays wherein the pro duced aluminum monochloride gas stream contains at least CO₂ and Cl₂ radical and this gas stream is initially passed through at least one bed of reducing agent selected from the group consisting of charcoal and devolatilized coke to con vert the CO₂ to CO subsequently the gas stream now con taining at least AlCl, CO and Cl₂ radical is contacted with molten aluminum metal to convert the Cl₂ radical to AlCl to produce a gas stream of which the major components are AlCl and CO substantially free of CO₂ and Cl₂ radical.
