## Description
VENTILATOR This invention relates to an improved ventilating or air moving device, suitable for use for example on vehicles including ships or for ventilating buildings. British Patent No. 295,019 describes a vehicle ventilating device having a driving rotor mounted between two parallel discs on top of the vehicle and coupled to drive a centrifugal fan, which draws air axially up through an aperture in the vehicle roof and drives it out through a circular gap between the bottom of the rotor and the roof. The rotor is driven by air flow as the vehicle moves, or by the wind, and is effective to operate the fan. In an alternative arrangement the fan outlet is arranged to be within the vehicle so that air is circulated wholly within the vehicle. In this way air can be circulated to a refrigerating system in a refrigerated van, for example. The prior devices have all been costly and have tended to be rather high, adding to the overall height of the vehicle. This is clearly disadvantageous. Furthermore, since the rotor is mounted between two discs the upper disc must generally be supported by peripheral struts and thus the device when mounted on a vehicle tends to catch on overhanging trees and the like and is very liable to damage both to itself and to the roof of the vehicle on which it is mounted. This invention provides a ventilating device comprising a centrifugal fan and a rotor capable of being rotated by moving air for driving the fan, the rotor comprising a base plate for outwardly deflecting air passing through the fan and an air scoop extending upwardly from the base plate comprising two arcuate rotor blades in spaced overlapping relation with their concave surfaces in opposition to define a sinusoidal passage between the rotor blades, and a cover plate extending only over the area defined between the rotor blades. The rotor and fan are carried on a mounting by which the ventilating device can be mounted on a vehicle or on a building. The mounting also preferably carries the bearings for the fan rotor, the bearings preferably forming a sealed unit. The ventilating device of the invention may be manufactured almost entirely of plastics material, for example polyproplyene, ABS or the like but the mounting may be made in plastics or metal, for example zinc alloy or aluminium. The ventilating device of the invention may be considerably lighter than hitherto known devices of similar capacity and operate sufficiently at much lower air speeds. A vehicle fitted with the device is much less vulnerable to damage from overhanging trees since because the cover plate does not extend beyond the rotor blades there is much less tendency for the upstanding part of the device to become caught up. The ventilating device of the invention may also comprise a closable shutter unit mounted below the centrifugal fan to control dm amount of air drawn into the fan. The invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an improved ventilator embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a plan view of the rotor Fig. 3 is a sectional elevational view through the ventilator when mounted on a roof with a shutter arranged below the ventilator input and Fig. 4 is an underplan view of the ventilator taken on the line IV IV on Fig. 3. Referring to the drawings, the ventilator comprises a rotor moulding or air scoop 10 which is shaped to be driven in rotation by air flow as indicated by the chain dotted lines inFig. 2. We have found that in fact the rotor need not be mounted between two discs, as had hitherto been thought, but that good results are achieved with the construction illustrated in which only the area defined between the two rotor blades 12 is covered as at 14. This has constructional and operational advantages in that it is possible to mould the rotor in a single moulding, and that it is less likely to catch on obstructions, such as the branches of trees, due to its relatively smooth contour. The bottom edges of the rotor fit into slots 16, seen inFig.4, which thus shows clearly the shape of the blades 12. Instead of slots, embossed recesses may be used. The slots or recesses 16 are formed in a cover plate 20 which has a downturned rim 22 and carries on its lower surface centrifugal fan impeller blades 24, seen in Figs. 3 and 4. The lower edges 26 of the blades 24 are received in slots 28 in a lower cover plate or shield 30, the plates 20 and 30 thus defining between them the axial extent of the centrifugal fan air path. To ensure that the blades 24 are securely attached to the cover plate 30, pegs or pins 29 are used to stake the lower edges of the blades and are sealed over with the application of heat. All the structure so far described is mounted for rotation on the vehicle roof 32 by means of a spoked mounting ring 34 having a central hollow boss 36. The cover plate 30 fits as closely as possible around the edge of the mounting ring 34. The boss 36 contains two sealed roller bearing units one of which is shown at 38 and which allows rotation of a central shaft 40 axially held in the bearings. The rotor 10 has a corresponding central boss 42 which receives this shaft 40 and is counterbored at 44 to receive two nuts 46 which are threaded onto the end of the shaft 40 to secure the rotor 10 and cover plate 20. A small cover disc 48 fits into the top of the recess 44. In use the air is driven outwardly by the centrifugal fan blades 24 driven by rotor 10 and air is drawn upwardly through an aperture 50 in the vehicle roof 32 as a result. The rotor operation is surprisingly effective and in one example started to be operative at an air speed of about 5 mph about 8 Sm hr and was fully effective at an air speed of about 10 mph about 16 Km hr over the vehicle roof and was fully effective at an air speed of about 20 mph about 32 Km hrl. Beneath the vehicle roof 32 it is possible to provide a closable shutter unit 52. This is essentially in two parts, namely a circular mounting and roof support plate 54 and a shutter 56 which clips to the rim of the mounting plate by three sprung lugs spaced around the periphery. The mounting plate 54 has mounting holes which are aligned with holes in the mounting plate 34 so that bolts 58 can secure both the ventilator and shutter unit to the vehicle roof 32. This strengthens the roof around the aperture 50. A neoprene seal or gasket can be included in the assembly. The shutter 56 itself comprises two slotted grilles one of which is slidable over the other by means of a button 60. The shutter may be flat as shown or slightly curved dished . It is seen that the ventilator consists essentially of the rotor 10, cover and fan plate 20, and lower shield plate 30, all of which can be formed from polypropylene mouldings. The mounting ring 34 can be a zinc alloy casting. The shutter unit can likewise be formed of plastics mouldings, using for instance a polypropylene co polymer or ABS plastic. It will be appreciated that the ventilator can be used in road or rail vehicles, on boats and ships, or on buildings or caravans, including stationary caravans. If increased power is required the height of the rotor should be increased.In a modified device, the mounting is between the rotor and the fan with the fan being inside the vehicle. In this form the device causes air circulation wholly within the vehicle.
