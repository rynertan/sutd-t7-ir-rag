## Description
This invention relates to an oil filled capacitor, comprising a wound film capacitor element wherein at least a part of the dielectric material is made of a plastic film. In recent years, oil filled capacitors are made small in size and durable to high voltages. With this tendency, various kinds of plastic materials have been used singly or together with the conventional insulating paper There are known metallized film capacitors hereinafter referred to as MF capacitors in which a deposited metal film that is made by vacuum depositing a metal such as aluminum or zinc, is wound as an electrode. MF capacitors of this kind are used widely because they have self healing action and can be made small in sizes with high dielectric strength even when they are not provided with any insulating films interposed among layers of electrodes. Furthermore, biaxially stretched polypropylene film is widely used for these MF capacitors because it is not expensive as compared with other films such as polyester film, in addition, the temperature characteristic of the dielectric loss can be improved. The MF capacitors presently used belong mainly to the so called dry type in which an electrically insulating impregnating agent such as insulating oil is not present. Generally not only in electric capacitors but also in other various electrical appliances, the potential gradient can be made high when electrodes or electric conductors are wholly surrounded by an electrically insulating impregnating agent. That is advantageous because the dielectric strength of electrical appliances can be improved. Furthermore, if the impregnating agent is properly selected, the high voltage withstanding property can be much improved. Accordingly, the so called oil impregnated or oil filled MF capacitors are more preferable than those of the dry type. However, when a metal deposited film with a polypropylene base film is impregnated with an electrically insulating impregnating agent, the size of the film is changed or the impregnating agent permeates through the boundary between the base film and the vacuum deposited metallic layer. Accordingly, the metallic layer is cracked, and what is worse, the metallic layer peels off resulting in dielectric breakdown. In addition, as the capacitor is impregnated with an impregnating agent after the film is wound, if the selection of impregnating agent is not adequately done, the impregnating agent cannot penetrate sufficiently into the clearances among film layers, and hence the aimed effect of impregnation cannot be expected. In the dry type capacitors, dielectric breakdown is often liable to occur in the marginal edges or peripheries of wound metallic layers. Therefore, an improvement in the dry type MF capacitors is intended to some extent by semi dry MF capacitors, by impregnating the edge and peripheral portions of wound film with an impregnating agent leaving internal portions unimpregnated. There is, however, a limit in the improving effect in the semi dry MF capacitors of the above type because it is impregnated only partially and most portions of electrode layers are left unimpregnated, and it may not be denied that the semi dry MF capacitors are not satisfactory as compared with fully impregnated capacitors. Accordingly, various MF capacitors of the impregnated type have been proposed. For example, JA A 55 36972 relates to an improved MF capacitor in which the expansion rate of metallized film that was swollen by an impregnating agent is made 0.5 or less. In GB A 1,451,499, an oil filled capacitor is disclosed in which the percentage of change in length of polypropylene film owing to an insulating oil is not more than 0.5 at 80 C and the diffusion quantity of the insulating oil into the polypropylene film is not more than 10 at 100 C, and this capacitor can be an MF capacitor. However, the above described MF capacitors do not always fit for practical uses. In European Patent No. A1 104786 is disclosed a metal deposited polypropylene film capacitor that is impregnated with 1,2 diarylethane. As described above, several attempts to improve capacitors have been made in connection with their base films and impregnating oils, however, there has never been proposed any satisfactory capacitor. Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 84, no. 14, page 587, Abstract no. 98495x states that certain hydrocarbons having a structure in which 3 benzene nuclei are linked via methylene groups and which are represented by general formulae, are electric insulating oils. In view of the above described conventional state of the art, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved oil filled capacitor which is free from the foregoing disadvantages of the conventional art. Another object of the present invention is to provide an oil filled capacitor, especially MF capacitor, which has excellent electrical characteristics. Subject matter of the present invention is an oil filled capacitor comprising a wound film capacitor element which is impregnated with an oil, at least a part of the dielectric material of said capacitor element being made of a plastics film, wherein said oil contains 1 phenyl 1 benzylphenyl ethane. In the present invention, the electrical insulating oil to be used for impregnating capacitors contains 1 phenyl 1 benzylphenyl ethane hereinafter referred to as PBPE . This PBPE has a lower viscosity and a lower pour point as compared with the conventionally known electrical insulating oil such as dibenzyltoluene which also has three aromatic rings and the same number of carbon atoms. In addition, PBPE is excellent in compatibility with plastic materials because it scarcely swells or dissolves plastic materials, especially polyolefins such as polypropylene. Even though the preparation method for PBPE is not limited, it is generally prepared by the following methods The oil filled capacitor according to the present invention is made by winding a metal foil such as aluminum foil as an electrode and a plastics film together to obtain a capacitor element which is then impregnated with an electrical insulating oil by the conventional method. In the oil filled capacitor of the present invention, the conventional insulating paper can be used together with a plastics film. As the plastics for the plastics films, there are polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polymethylpentene, polyesters and polyvinylidene fluoride. Among them, the polyolefins are preferable and polypropylene is more preferable. Among oil filled capacitors, especially desirable capacitors are the above mentioned MF capacitors in which the electrode comprises the metal layer that is formed by vacuum depositing a metal such as aluminum or zinc on a plastics film. The MF capacitor is made by winding a metallized plastics film and then impregnated with an electrical insulating oil according to the conventional method. The foregoing plastics can be employed as the materials for plastics films and polyolefin, especially polypropylene is suitable. In the invention it is essential that the impregnating oil contains PBPE, however, it is possible to use the impregnating oil by mixing it at arbitrary ratio with one or more kinds of known electrical insulating oils such as refined mineral oils, polybutene, alkylbenzenes, diarylalkanes such as diphenylmethane, phenylxylylethane and phenylcumenylethane, alkylbiphenyls such as isopropylbiphenyl, alkylnaphthalenes such as diisopropylnaphthalene, triarylalkanes or triaryldialkanes such as trimer of styrene, distyrenated xylene and dibenzyltoluene, phthalic esters such as DOP, and animal or vegetable oils such as castor oil. As described in the foregoing paragraph, the PBPE used for the oil filled capacitor of the present invention has a lower viscosity and lower pour point compared with the conventionally known electrical insulating oils such as dibenzyltoluene or the like. Furthermore, the PBPE scarcely swells or dissolves plastics materials, especially polyolefins such as polypropylene. Accordingly, the PBPE is excellent in impregnating property and in compatibility with plastics materials which facts make it possible to produce oil filled capacitors that are excellent in durability and dielectric strength. In the following, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to examples. To a reaction vessel were added 2500 g of 1,1 diphenylethane and 30 g of FeCl₃. Reaction was carried out by adding dropwise 500 g of benzyl chloride for 2 hours at room temperature. After the reaction, the catalyst was deactivated and 1280 g of 1 phenyl 1 benzylphenyl ethane was recovered by reduced pressure distillation. The properties of the obtained product were as follows Aluminum was deposited on one side surface of a capacitor use stretched polypropylene film by a usual vacuum deposition method to obtain a 40 mm wide metal deposited film with 3 mm margins. Capacitor elements were made by winding this metal deposited film and they were impregnated with the above insulating oil by an ordinary method to obtain MF capacitors of 5 µF in electrostatic capacity. These capacitors were then applied with various electric voltages to determine the times when half the number of capacitors were broken down. The results of this test are shown in the following Table 1. To a reaction vessel were added 2500 g of toluene and 50 g of FeCl₃ and reaction was carried out for 3 hours by adding 1500 g of benzyl chloride with stirring at room temperature. After the reaction, the catalyst was deactivated and 660 g of dibenzyltoluene was obtained. The pour point of the dibenzyltoluene was 30 C and the viscosity, 16.8 cSt at 40 C, which were inferior to those values of the insulating oil of the invention in the foregoing Example. The above dibenzyltoluene was impregnated into capacitor elements and these were subjected to the test of dielectric breakdown times in the like manner as in the Example. The results of the test are shown in the following Table 1.
