## Description
The invention relates to the treatment of migraine with certain tropyl benzoate derivatives and provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds. Further, the invention also provides said compounds for use in treating migraine and, when said compounds are novel, it provides said novel compounds Acute attacks of migraine are usually treated with a peripheral vasoconstrictor, such as ergotamine, which may be co administered with caffeine, and dihydroergotamine an antipyretic analgesic, such as acetylsalicylic acid or p acetylaminophenol and or an anti emetic such as cyclizine, metoclopramide and thiethylperazine. It has also been reported J.B. Hughes Med. J. Aust. 2, No. 17, 580, 1977 that immediate relief of acute migraine attack can be obtained by slow intravenous injection of metoclopramide 10 mg . It is believed that 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 HT is the naturally occurring substance most likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Increased amounts of 5 HT and its metabolite 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid are excreted in the urine during most attacks. Further, plasma and platelet 5 HT concentrations fall rapidly at the onset of an attack and remain low whilst the headache persists. Moreover, attacks of migraine have been clearly associated with periods of thrombocytopaenia in certain patients. It has been proposed that compounds which block the activity of 5 HT would be of use in the treatment of migraine J.R. Fozard, International Headache Congress 1980 reported in Advances in Neurology, Vol 33, Raven Press, New York 1982 . The known migraine prophylactic drugs methysergide, propranolol, amitriptyline, and chlorpromazine have widely different pharmacological activities but are all 5 HT D receptor antagonists at the doses used clinically for the treatment of migraine. Metoclopramide is a potent 5 HT M receptor antagonist and it has been proposed J.R. Fozard It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds which are more potent and selective 5 HT M receptor antagonists than metoclopramide and hence indicated for use in the treatment of migraine. The potency as 5 HT M receptor antagonists of cocaine and some related compounds has been reported J.R. Fozard Surprisingly, it has been found that substitution of benzoyltropine by alkyl, alkoxy or halogen in the 3, 3 and 5, or 3, 4 and 5 positions of the benzene ring substantially enhances its potency as a 5 HT M receptor antagonist. The tropyl benzoate derivatives of Formula I set forth in the following Table I are known compounds. Some of the said known tropyl benzoate derivatives and certain known positional isomers thereof have been reported to have pharmacological activity, specifically local anesthetic, central nervous system stimulant, cholinolytic and or spasmolytic activity. However no pharmacological activity indicating use in the treatment of migraine has been reported. The compounds of Formula I can be effectively administered in the treatment of migraine at dose levels well below those at which pharmacological activity has previously been reported for any of the said known compounds or their known isomers. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided the use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of migraine of a tropyl benzoate derivative of the following general Formula I wherein According to another aspect of the invention there are provided pharmaceutical compositions in unit dose form for the treatment of migraine comprising a compound of general Formula I in admixture or otherwise associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier and containing 0.5 to 100 mg per unit dose. Usually, said compositions will contain 1 to 50 mg, especially 3 to 30 mg, per unit dose. According to a further aspect of the invention, there are provided Migraine is treated by administering to a patient suffering migraine, an effective migraine relieving amount of a compound of Formula I. Said amount usually will be in the range 0.01 mg kg to 10 mg kg, especially 0.03 mg kg to 3.0 mg kg. It is also contemplated that the compounds of Formula I can be used in the prophylaxis of migraine by administering to a patient at risk of migraine an effective migraine prophylatic amount of the compound. The compounds of general Formula I have the benzoyloxy moiety substituted in that R₁ represents C₁ C₄ alkyl, C₁ C₄ alkoxy or halogen R₂ can represent C₁ C₄ alkyl, C₁ C₄ alkoxy or halogen instead of hydrogen and R₃ is hydrogen except when R₂ is other than hydrogen, in which case R₃ can represent C₁ C₄ alkyl, C₁ C₄ alkoxy or halogen instead of hydrogen. Examples of C₁ C₄ alkyl groups which can be represented by R₂, R₃ and R₄ are methyl, ethyl, Examples of C₁ C₄ alkoxy groups which can be represented by R₂, R₃ and R₄ are methoxy, ethoxy, The halogens which can be represented by R₂, R₃ and R₄ are bromine, chlorine, fluorine and iodine with bromine, fluorine and, especially, chlorine being preferred. One preferred class of compounds are those of Formula I in which R₁ represents methyl, methoxy or chlorine, R₂ represents hydrogen, and R₃ represents hydrogen. Another preferred class of compounds are those of Formula I in which R₁ and R₂ are the same and each represents methyl, methoxy or chlorine, and R₃ represents hydrogen. Yet another preferred class of compounds are those of Formula I in which R₁, R₂ and R₃ are all the same and each represents methyl, methoxy or chlorine. In one presently particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds are those of Formula I in which a R₁ represents methoxy and R₂ and R₃ represent hydrogen, b R₁ and R₂ both represents methoxy and R₃ represents hydrogen, or c R₁, R₂ and R₃ each represent methoxy. Said compounds are The di and tri methoxy compounds are preferred over the monomethoxy compound. In another presently particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds are those of Formula I in which a R₁ represents chlorine and R₂ and R₃ represent hydrogen, b R₁ and R₂ both represent chlorine and R₃ represents hydrogen, or c R₁, R₂ and R₃ each represent chlorine. Said compounds are The dichloro compound is presently preferred to the mono or tri chloro compounds. In addition to the preferred methoxy and chloro compounds specified above, the following are illustrative compounds of Formula I The compounds of Formula I block the M receptors for 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 HT on afferent sensory neurones, certain of which subserve the transmission of pain. As explained above, the blocking of such M receptors is believed to be a mechanism by which the symptoms of migraine can be relieved. The activity of the compounds against 5 HT can be assessed by determining their pA₂ values in the isolated rabbit heart as described by Fozard The pA₂ values of some representative compounds of Formula I are given in the following Table II The pA₂ values of some closely structurally related compounds to those of the invention are given in the following Table III for comparative purposes. It will be noted from Tables II and III that the compounds of Formula I show in this test a potency as 5 HT M receptor antagonists at least an order greater than that of tropylbenzoate. The activity of the compounds against 5 HT can be assessed The compounds of Formula I are highly selective in their action against 5 HT M receptor. Their potency against other 5 HT receptors and other spasmogens, in particular oxytocin, acetylcholine, histamine and calcium, appears to be at least two orders lower than that against 5 HT M receptors see Example 4 . Accordingly, their use in the treatment of migraine should be without any side effects. The compounds of Formula I can be administered in various manners to achieve the desired effect. The compounds can be administered alone or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations to the patient being treated either orally or parenterally, for example, subcutaneously or intravenously. The amount of compound administered will vary and can be any effective migraine relieving amount. Depending upon the patient and the mode of administration, the quantity of compound administered may vary over a wide range to provide from 0.01 mg kg to 10 mg kg, usually 0.03 to 3.0 mg kg, of body weight of the patient per dose. Unit doses of these compounds can contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 100 mg, usually 1 to 50 mg and preferably 3 to 30 mg, of the compound and may be administered, for example, from 1 to 4 times daily. It will be appreciated that the dosage levels referred to above are substantially less than those which would be required for medical treatment based on any known pharmacological activity of any of the known compounds of Formula I. In the particular case of, for example, tropine 3,5 dichlorobenzoate, The term unit dosage form is used herein to mean a single or multiple dose form containing a quantity of the active ingredient in admixture with or otherwise in association with the diluent or carrier, said quantity being such that one or more predetermined units are normally required for a single therapeutic administration. In the case of multiple dose forms such as liquids or scored tablets, said predetermined unit will be one fraction, such as a 5 ml teaspoon quantity of a liquid or a half or quarter of a scored tablet, of the multiple dose form. In the composition aspect of the invention there are provided pharmaceutical formulations in which form the active compounds of the invention will normally be utilized. Such formulations are prepared in a manner well known The formulations of the invention may be adapted for enteral or parenteral use and may be administered to the patient in the form of tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions or suspensions. In the specific examples included hereinbelow illustrative examples of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described. The tropyl benzoate derivatives of Formula I can be used in migraine therapy with antimigraine drugs having different modes of action. Such drugs include those used prophylactically, such as barbiturates, diazepam, chlorpromazine, amitriptyline, propranolol, methysergide, pizotifen, cyproheptadine, dihydroergotamine, and clonidine, and those used in the acute attack, such as vasoconstrictor agents, e.g. ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, analgaesic anti inflammatory agents, e.g. aspirin, paracetamol and indomethacin, or anti nauseants, e.g. cyclizine, metoclopramide, and triethylperazine see Fozard, J.R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. As mentioned above, certain of the compounds of Formula I are known compounds and hence their preparation or, in the case of naturally occurring compounds, their isolation is described in the literature. The compounds of general Formula I can be prepared in manner known wherein The reaction can be carried out in the absence of a solvent by heating at, for example, a temperature in the range 140 to 160 C the acid halide with a hydrohalide salt of tropine whilst stirring. Hydrogen halide is evolved and the mixture first becomes liquid but subsequently becomes solid. Heating is continued for about 15 mins after solidification and the mixture is then cooled and added to water. The product is the hydrohalide of the compound of Formula I and the free base can be obtained by addition of aqueous base, such as sodium or potassium carbonate, which does not hydrolyse the ester, to render the aqueous product solution alkaline and subsequent extraction of the free base with a suitable organic solvent such as, for example, diethyl ether, ethylacetate and methylene chloride. The organic solution is subsequently evaporated and the residue recrystallized from, for example, aqueous methanol. As mentioned previously, the compounds of Formula I can be used in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be non toxic addition salts with suitable acids, such as those with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids, or with organic acids, such as organic carboxylic acids, for example, glycollic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, malic, tartaric, citric, salicylic, Apart from pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, other acid addition salts, such as for example, those with picric or oxalic acid, may be serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds or in the preparation of other, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable, acid addition salts, or are useful for identification or characterisation of the bases. An acid addition salt may be converted into the free compound according to known methods, for example, by treating it with a base, such as with a metal hydroxide or alkoxide, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide with a metal carbonate, such as an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, for example, sodium, potassium or calcium carbonate or hydrogen carbonate with trialkylamine or with an anion exchange resin. An acid addition salt may also be converted into another acid addition salt according to known methods for example, a salt with an inorganic acid may be treated with a metal salt, for example a sodium, barium or silver salt, or an acid in a suitable diluent, in which a resulting inorganic salt is insoluble and is thus removed from the reaction medium. Acid addition salt may also be converted into another acid addition salt by treatment with an anion exchange preparation. The invention is illustrated in the following examples. Tropine 34.24 g is treated with anhydrous diethyl ether and ethereal hydrogen chloride and the precipitated hydrochloride is isolated by evaporation of the solvent. 3,5 Dichlorobenzoylchloride 51.7 g is added and the mixture stirred at 140 C for 15 mins during which time the mixture liquefies, evolves hydrogen chloride gas and resolidifies. After heating for a further 15 mins the cooled solid is dissolved in water, an excess of an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate is added, and the base is extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the dried ethyl acetate solution gives a solid which is recrystallised from aqueous methanol to give tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate m.p. 95 C 51.8 g . The following compounds are prepared by the same method. A stirred mixture of tropine hydrochloride 5.27 g and 3,5 dimethyl benzoyl chloride 5g is heated at 130 140 for 30 minutes during which time the mixture liquifies, evolves hydrogen chloride gas and resolidifies. A solution of the cooled solid in water is basified with a solution of potassium carbonate and the base extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution is washed several times with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, and evaporated to give the free base which is converted to the hydrochloride by the addition of ethereal hydrogen chloride. Recrystallization of the precipitated solid from ethanol gives crystal of tropyl 3,5, dimethylbenzoate hydrochloride 5.4 g mp 260 . Antagonism of the von Bezold Jarisch reflex evoked by 5 HT in the anaesthetised rat was measured for tropyl 3,5 dimethoxybenzoate A tropyl 3,5 dimethylbenzoate B and tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate C using the following method. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250 300 g are anaesthetized with urethane, 1.25 g kg injected intraperitoneally and set up for recording blood pressure and heart rate as described in Fozard JR The results obtained are set forth in Table IV below in which the compounds are identified by the reference letters used above. In a comparative test metoclopramide gave a threshold dose of 233.4 66.3 µg kg and an ED50 of 408.4 80.9 µg kg. This comparative test shows that compounds A, B and C are many times more potent than metoclopramide in this particular test indicating a corresponding reduction in dosage levels in the treatment of migraine. Compounds A, B and C are also relatively non toxic as shown by their respective LD50 values in the mouse and rat see Table V . A selection of classical From Table VI it is clear that A, B and C were at least 700 times and in several instances greater than 50,000 times more potent as blockers of the 5 HT M receptor than of responses elicited through other means. This study was designed to evaluate tolerance and, if possible, efficacy of intravenous tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate In patients with migraine or cluster headaches. Eight patients 4 males , aged 27 47 with known headache disorders of 5 27 years duration see Table VII took part in the study but Patient Nos. 2 and 4 had cluster not migraine headaches and the cause of headaches in Patient No. 6 was unknown. Tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate was provided as a sterile solution, 1 mg ml the desired dose to be diluted in 10 ml normal saline for intravenous infusion over a 2 minute period. No other therapy was taken for at least 24 hours before treatment or during the course of therapy. The initial dose of 1 mg, when shown to be well tolerated, was increased gradually in subsequent patients. Table VIII . Doses as high as 14 mg day and 9 mg single dose were administered without any signs of intolerance. Cumulative doses as high as 177 mg over 18 days were also well tolerated. In 2 of the 3 patients treated with repeated doses of tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate patients 6 and 8 , a marked diminution of headache and associated symptoms occurred. Thus, Patient No. 6, refractory to standard migraine therapies, had a slight reduction in her bilateral headache with 3 mg single doses and a further amelioration with 4 mg bid. This reduction in headache intensity lasted over a 2½ week period. Patient No. 8, an abuser of analgesics with daily bilateral headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting, vertigo and photophobia, had a decrease in all symptoms with the first dose of 3 mg. This amelioration continued with subsequent increases in doses, except for a single episode of symptom return on first day of 9 mg. Within 6 7 days of stopping therapy, headache returned to pre treatment intensity. It can be seen from Table VIII that single intravenous doses of tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate up to 9 mg or repeated doses up to 7 mg bid were well tolerated in patients with headaches. In some patients treated with doses of 3 mg or greater, pain intensity and associated symptoms were ameliorated. In the following Examples relating to pharmaceutical compositions, the term active compound is used to indicate the compound tropyl 3,5 dichlorobenzoate. This compound may be replaced in these compositions by any other compound of Formula I, for example by tropyl 3,5 dimethoxybenzoate. Adjustments in the amount of medicament may be necessary or desirable depending upon the degree of activity of the medicament as is well known in the art. An illustrative composition for hard gelatin capsules is as follows The formulation is prepared by passing the dry powders of a and b through a fine mesh screen and mixing them well. The powder is then filled into hard gelatin capsules at a net fill of 100 mg per capsule. An illustrative composition for tablets is as follows The granulation obtained upon mixing the lactose with the compound a and part of the starch and granulated with starch paste is dried, screened, and mixed with the magnesium stearate. the mixture is compressed into tables weighing 100 mg each. An illustrative composition for an injectable suspension is the following 1 ml ampul for an intramuscular injection The material a d are mixed, homogenized, and filled into 1 ml ampuls which are sealed and autoclaved 20 minutes at 121 C. Each ampul contains 1.0 mg per ml of compound a . The medicament is powdered and passed through a B.S. No. 100 Sieve and triturated with molten oil of Theobroma at 45 C to form a smooth suspension. The mixture is well stirred and poured into moulds each of nominal 1G capacity, to produce suppositories.
