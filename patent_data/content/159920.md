# AQUEOUS FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
An aqueous fabric softening composition containing less than 10 cationic softener also includes an alkoxylated fatty alcohol, acid or ester having up to 7 alkylene oxide groups per molecule, such as ethoxylated tallow alcohol or iso stearic acid at exemplified levels of 4.0 to 12.0 together with an electrolyte selected from ionic salts of lithium, mag nesium, calcium and aluminium. The alkoxylated compound enhances the softening and anti static properties of the com position.
