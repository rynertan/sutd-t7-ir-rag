## Description
This invention relates to moldable compositions. In one of its more specific aspects this invention relates to a thermoplastic molding composition which comprises a blend of A a copolymer of recurring units of a monoalkenyl aromatic monomer, an α,β ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride N substituted imide and, optionally, a third αβ ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B an elastomer having a polymer graft which is thermodynamically miscible with A . Impact modification of moldable monoalkenyl aromatic polymers can be accomplished either by insitu polymerization of the monomer units in the presence of an elastomeric polymer or by modification of the elastomeric polymer so as to introduce graft species which exhibit an interaction chemical or physical with the monoalkenyl aromatic polymer. One of the preferred interactions which is sought is that of thermodynamic miscibility i.e., two polymers which when blended with one another, exhibit physical and rheological properties synonomous with a single polymer phase. However, the miscibility of the two polymers in a blend is typically the exception not the rule and so when miscibility interactions result from the specific modification of one or more of the polymer components of a blend, they are unexpected but desired because unique and useful properties are obtained. This invention provides impact modified high heat, monoalkenyl aromatic co and terpolymers prepared via modification of a thermoplastic elastomer such that at least one block segment of the thermoplastic elastomer is thermodynamically miscible with the monoalkenyl aromatic co or terpolymer.

In a preferred embodiment, copolymer A also comprises recurring units of a third monomer, which is an α,β ethylenically unsaturated monomer which incorporates in a random or alternating fashion with both the monoalkenyl aromatic monomer and the α,β ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride imide. Also, according to this invention, there is provided a method of producing a molded composition which comprises forming a blend of A a copolymer or recurring units of a monoalkenyl aromatic monomer and recurring units of and α,β ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride N substituted imide and B a hydrogenated elastomeric block copolymer having at least one substantially completely hydrogenated diene polymer mid block and at least two monoalkenyl arene polymer end blocks said polymer end blocks including arene groups which are substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of nitro, cyano and trifluromethonesulfonyl, and molding the resulting blend. According to this invention there is also provided a molded composition comprising a continuous phase comprising a copolymer having recurring units of a monoalkenyl aromatic monomer and recurring units of an α,β ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride N substituted imide and a disperse phase within the continuous phase, the disperse phase being a hydrogenated elastomeric block copolymer having at least one substantially completely hydrogenated diene polymer mid block and at least two monoalkenyl arene polymer end blocks said polymer end blocks including arene groups which are substituted with at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of nitro, cyano and trifluoromethanesulfonyl.
