# Method for injecting exotic atoms into a solid material with electron beams.

## Abstract
A method for injecting exotic atoms into a solid material substrate S,1 with electron beams 4 comprises irradiating a material having a layered structure including at least one thin film F,2 adhered to a solid material substrate S,1 , with electron beams 4 , and ejecting the exotic atoms out of the film F,2 into an irradiation region of the substrate S,1 . This method gives desired forms such as crystalline, noncrystal line, or solid solution of the materials depending on the conditions of electron irradiation.
