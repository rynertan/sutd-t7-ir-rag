## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF TAMOXIFEN Background Of The Invention This invention relates to a novel and economical process for the preparation of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a known non steroidal antiestrogen useful in the treatment of hormone dependent tumors such as breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the Z or trans isomer of 1,2 diphenyl 1 4 2 dimethylamino ethoxy phenyl 1 butene and has the formula EMI2.1 When produced by known processes, the tamoxifen is formed in admixture with the corresponding E or cis isomer. Since the desired biological activity resides only in the Z isomer, the mixture of geometric isomers resulting from chemical synthesis must be separated. A number of processes are known in the art for the production of tamoxifen and the corresponding E isomer. Thus, U.K. Patent No. 1,013,907 discloses a process which involves dehydration of an alkanol intermediate using an acid catalyst such as HC1 to produce a mixture of tamoxifen and the corresponding E isomer.

The use of low valent titanium as a reducing agent to reductively dimerize aldehydes and ketones to olefins is known in the art. Thus, J.E. McMurry, M.P.Fleming, K.L. Kees and L.R. Krepski in J. Org. Chem.,Vol. 43, pages 3255 66 1978 report the use of active titanium metal, produced in a finely divided form by reduction of TiC13 with either potassium or lithium, to reductively couple carbonyls to form olefins. One reaction disclosed in this paper is illustrated by the following equation EMI5.1 J.E. McMurry and M.P. Fleming in J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol 96, pages 4708 9 1974 disclose the reductive dimerization of a compound having the formula EMI5.2 to obtain an oleo in having the formula EMI6.1 using LiA1E4 TiC13 as the reducing agent. t. Castedo, J.M. Saa, R. Suau and G. Tojo inJ. Org. Chem,, Vol. 46, pages 4292 94 1981 report that the low valent titanium reagents used to reductively couple ketones and aldehydes to form olefines also react with other functional groups and that their use had in the past been assumed to be limited to cases where functional groups other than alcohols, ethers and olefines are not present. They report that low valent titanium species seem in most cases to be active TiO. These authors found that ester groups could also be present without being adversely affected by the reaction conditions.Due to the high reactivity of low valent titanium reagents with nitrogen containing compounds, it would be expected that aldehydes and ketones which are to be reductively coupled to form an oleo in by the use of a low valent titanium reagent should be free of amino groups.Summary Of The Invention It has now been discovered that a mixture of tamoxifen and the corresponding E isomer can be produced by a process which comprises the reductive coupling of 4 beta diinethylaminoethoxy benzophenone, or an acid salt thereof, and propiophenone, said coupling being induced in the presence of a low valent titanium reagent. The reaction which occurs is illustrated by the following equation EMI7.1 Tamoxifen corresponding cis isomer TiO2 Tamoxifen can be separated from the resultant mixture of cis and trans isomers by conventional means, e.g., by selective crystallization.Detailed Description Of The Invention The low valent titanium reagent can be prepared by procedures well known in the art, i.e., by reduction of TiC13 or TiC14 with Mg, Zn, K, Li or LiAlH4. The TiC13 or TiC14 is added to a common ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane or dimethylethane before, after or concurrently with the Mg, Zn, K, Li or LiAlH4. In the case of TiC14, it is preferred to first dissolve it in a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene and then to add the ether solvent to this solution. The mixture of TiC13 or TiC14 and metal in the solvent is heated to reflux, preferably for from 4 24 hours to form a slurry of low valent activated titanium reagent. The reagent may be used in the subsequent reductive coupling reaction as formed, i.e., it need not be isolated from the slurry. It may be used while still hot or it may be cooled and stored for a period of hours before using. However, it is preferred to use the reagent within 24 hours of its preparation, since it is likely to start to deteriorate after that time, thus resulting in lowered yields of tamoxifen and the corresponding cis isomer. The reductive coupling reaction is preferably conducted in an inert solvent, e.g., an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane or dimethoxyethane. The 4 beta dimethylaminoethoxy ben zophenone may be used in the form of the free base or an acid salt. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicyclic, malic, fumaric, succinic, methanesulfonic, and the like, The 4 beta dimethylaminoethoxy benzophenone can be added to the low valent activated titanium reagent prior to the addition of the propiophenone in which case it will form a complex with the low valent activated titanium reagent.This complex can then be titrated by the slow addition of propiophenone, i.e., the low valent activated titanium reagent 4 beta d methylaminoethoxy benzophenone complex will react with the propiophenone as soon as the propiophenone is added. Alternatively, the 4 beta dimethylaminoeth oxy benzophenone can be added to the activated titanium reagent in admixture with the propiophenone in which case it is preferred to use from 1 to 1.5 mole of propiophenone per mole of 4 beta dimethylaminoethoxy benzophenone. The propiophenone should not be added first to the low valent activated titanium reagent since it would immediately couple with itself. At least one mole of low valent activated titanium reagent is preferably present for each mole of propiophenone and 4 beta dimethylaminoethoxy benzophenone. The reductive coupling reaction is preferably conducted by heating the reaction. After the reductive coupling reaction is complete, the mixture of tamoxifen and its E isomer can be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional techniques. The tamoxifen can then be separated from th E isomer by known procedures, i.e., by chromatogra phy or fractional crystallization. The herein described reductive coupling procedure for the production of tamoxifen is, more efficient and economical than any of the prior art processes for the production of tamoxifen. The following example illustrates the process of this invention. ExampleI. Preparation of Retone Mixture 4 Beta dimethylaminoethoxy benzophenone HC1 50.0g, 0.164 mole was suspended in 600 ml of methylene chloride and 600 ml of water at room temperature initial pH of 2.9 . The pH was raised to 12.2 by the dropwise addition of 14 ml of 50 w w NaOH. The two phase system was stirred for 20 minutes at 20 CC, with no change in pH. The phases were separated, and the aqueous was discarded. The organic phase was vacuum concentrated at 250C to an oil. The oil was dissolved in 200 ml of THF tetrahydrofuran and reconcentrated under vacuum at 30 CC. The oily residue was then dissolved in 150 ml of THF.Propiophenone 30.9 g, 0.245 mole was added and the solution of ketones was charged into a 250 ml addition funnel. II. Preparation of Low Valent Activated Titanium Reagent, Ti Titanium trichloride 164.6 g, 1.06 mole was added to 1,000 ml of THF, and the slurry was mechanically stirred under a blanket of nitrogen for 15 minutes at 300C. Powdered zinc 180 g, 2.75 mole was added in one portion, and the slurry was heated to reflux 670C for 4 hours, then allowed to cool to 600C. III. Ketone Coupling Reaction The solution of ketones from step I was added in 15 minutes to the warm, well stirred Ti slurry, rinsed forward with a 100 ml portion of THF, and brought back to reflux for 1 hour and 30 minutes.IV. Isolation of Crude HC1 Salt of Tamoxifen and E Isomer The reaction was cooled to 250C and poured into a 5 liter, round bottom flask charged with 2 liters of distilled water, and digested at 40 500C for 30 minutes under a blanket of nitrogen. The slurry was filtered through Dicalite, and this filter cake was washed 2 times with 100 ml portions of tetrahydrofuran.The tetrahydrofuran was removed by distillation at reduced pressure about 15 mm Hg . The concentrate was extracted two times with 1250 ml portions of methylene chloride. The combined methylene chloride extracts were washed with two 750 ml portions of water.The methylene chloride solution was then stirred for 15 minutes with water 1000 ml and the pH was adjusted to 12.7. The phases were separated with the aqueous discarded. The methylene chloride phase was concentrated to an oil. At this point, the ratio of Z to E isomer was about 2 1. The oil was dissolved in 200 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone, and concentrated to an oil. This residue free of methylene chloride was dissolved in 1 liter of methyl isobutyl ketone, washed with 1 liter of distilled water and the pH was readjusted to 12 with 50 sodium hydroxide solution The phases were separated and the organic phase retained. The methyl isobutyl ketone solution was vacuum concentrated to a volume of 750 ml. A 3 liter round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirring was charged with the methyl isobutyl ketone solution of tamoxifen free base and the corresponding E isomer. To this solution, 13.7 ml of 12 N hydrochloric acid was added in 5 minutes to form tamoxifen hydrochloride and the corresponding E isomer. The slurry that formed was chilled to 0 50C and held for 18 hours, filtered, washed with 350 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone OOC , and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 800C for 18 hours to yield 34.2 a, .084 mole, 51.2 yield of the hydrochloride salt of tamoxi fen and the corresponding E isomer of 85 purity. The Z E isomer ratio was 97.5 1.
