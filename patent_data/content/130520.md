# Stabilized test composition, device and method for the determination of peroxidatively active substances.

## Abstract
A test composition, device and method for determining a peroxidatively active substance in a test sample, as well as a method for preparing and using the device, are disclosed. The composition comprises an organic hydroperoxide, an indicator capable of providing a detectable response in the presence of the organic hydroperoxide and a peroxidatively active sub stance, and, as a stabilizing agent, an aniline having the for mula
