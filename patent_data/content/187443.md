# Belt conveyor cross stream sampling system.

## Abstract
A mechanized system and method for obtaining representative samples of bulk material from a belt conveyor A by removing a cross stream increment of the bulk material from the conveyor belt 24 . The system includes plate means 46, 47 for segregating therebetween a cross stream increment of the hulk material on the conveyor, impeller means 44, 49 . For removing the thus segregated cross stram and contour means 45 for supporting and conforming the conveyor belt 24 to the operative course of the sample taking means as it moves across said belt.
