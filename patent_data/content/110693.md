## Abstract
A novel tobacco for smoking articles which is an air cured bright tobacco harvested by stalk cutting, priming, or a combi nation of partial priming followed by stalk cutting, and charac terized by a total reducing sugar content within the range of from 0 to about 6 , a chlorogenic acid content within the range of from 0 to about 0.4 , a rutin content within the range of from 0 to about 0.2 , a hot water solubles content within the range of from about 45 to about 55 , a total ash content within the range of from about 12 to about 26 , a combined proline and threonine content within the range of from 0 to about 1 mg g, a combined aspartic acid and asparagine content within the range of from about 0.5 to about 7 mg g, and a com bined glutamic acid and glutamic content within the range of from about 0.5 to about 1.6 mg g all measurements being on a dry weight basis. This novel tobacco, when formulated as a smoking article, such as a cigarette, and smoked, presents the aroma and taste of a blended tobacco smoking article and may be substituted in whole or in part for burley tobacco in blended tobaccos while substantially maintaining the subjective quali ties of the burley tobacco and yet, as compared to the burley tobacco containing blends, provides a reduced NO content in the smoke.
