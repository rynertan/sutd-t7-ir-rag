## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory, and in particular to a one transistor dynamic MOS memory which enables an increase in memory capacity without increasing the space required, and which is suitable for increasing memory size. The memory size of MOS dynamic memories quadrupled in the approximately three years after the 1K bit dynamic random access memory hereinafter referred to ad dRAM was first sold in the early 1970s. 16 pin DIPs dual inline packages are mainly used for accommodatting memory chips, but this imposes a limitation on the size of the cavity for inserting the chips. Therefore the size of memory chip has increased by approximately 1.4 times, despite the fact that the degree of integration has quadrupled. Since large quantities of dRAMs are used, it is necessary to curb any increase of the chip size , if only from the standpoint of cost. Therefore, the area of memory cell per bit of one storage unit is greatly reduced, i.e., is reduced to above one third, owing to the quadrupled degree of integration. The capacity C of a semiconductor memory is expressed by C εA T If noise voltage is denoted by N, the signal to noise ratio S N ratio decreases with a decrease in the signal quantity S, raising a problem with regard to the operation of the circuit. Usually, therefore, a decrease in the capacitor area A is compensated by decreasing the insulator thickness T Recently it has been confirmed that noise results from electric charges of a maximum of approximately 200 fC generated in a silicon substrate by alpha particles radiated from radioactive heavy metals such as U, Th, etc. within the package. In order to maintain reliability in operation, therefore, it is not possible to reduce the signal quantity, i.e., the electric charge, to below about 200 fC. Because of these reasons, therefore, attempts have been made to reduce the thickness of the insulator further, raising a problem with regard to the dielectric breakdown of the insulator. The SiO₂film which is usually used as the insulator of the capacitor has a dielectric withstand electric field of a maximum of 10⁷ V cm. Therefore, a 10 nm thick SiO₂ film will break down permanently, or be degraded, when a voltage of 10 volts is applied. Using such a device close to its maximum dielectric withstand electric field causes a serious problem with regard to its long term reliability, if it does not break down permanently. A one transistor dRAM memory cell may consist of a capacitor for storing electric charge, and a switching MOS transistor. The drain of the switching MOS transistor is connected to a bit line, and its gate is connected to a word line. Such a memory cell is operated by the reading out of the signal charge stored in the capacitor by the switching MOS transistor. If the stray capacitance of a stray capacitor of the bit line is denoted by C In the conventional memory cell, the area available for the region of the capacitor C To solve the above problem, a memory is disclosed in JP A 51 130178, in which a narrow groove is formed in the silicon substrate, and a capacitor that acts as the memory capacitor is formed on the surfaces of the groove. In this memory, the side and bottom surfaces of the groove are utilized as the electrode surfaces of the capacitor, providing the advantage that the electrode area is considerably increased without increasing the space required, compared with the memory of the conventional construction. JP A 55 19820 further discloses a memory cell in which a capacitor and a switching transistor are formed laterally adjacent each other, the capacitor being composed of a surface portion of a silicon substrate and a silicon layer disposed on the substrate with an SiO₂ layer therebetween. Here again, part of the substrate is utilized for the capacitor. WO 81 O3241 discloses a semiconductor integrated circuit such as a RAM in which grooves are formed in a semiconductor body. The side walls of the groove are covered by an insulating film. The interior of the groove is filled by conductive material forming a first electrode of a capacitor, the other electrode is formed by a doped layer surrounding the groove, and having a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate. The object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor memory which has a capacitor with good characteristics but requires only a small space, yet overcoming the serious problems such as the alpha particle induced disturbances that arise with a decrease in size of a memory cell, while maintaining high S N ratio and breakdown voltage. These objects are achieved by the features of claim 1. The single Figure is a section view through an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment described below, a memory is provided which has a capacitor in a memory capacitor portion which has an increased capacity without requiring an increase space, and which is hardly affected at all by external noise, the capacitor being constructed within a groove formed in the substrate. In the drawing, reference numeral 3 denotes a bit line, 4 a word line, 10 a p type silicon substrate, 12 a first intermediate insulation film, 14 a second intermediate insulation film, 15 an n type diffusion layer, 17 a groove, 18 a capacitor insulation film, 19 a capacitor electrode, 23 an SOI layer, and 24 a transistor channel. For forming this embodiment, a groove 17 is etched in the substrate 10, thereafter the capacitor insulation film 18 is desposited in the groove and then a single crystalline silicon film is formed on said insulation film 18, thereby forming an SOI silicon on insulator construction which includes places that will become the capacitor electrode 19 and the diffusion layer 15 in subsequent steps. Namely, a polycrystalline or amorphous silicon film is deposited over the whole surface, or over part of the surface , and the whole or part of the surface is heated by a laser beam or by a heater, so that a monocrystalline layer 23 grows on the insulation film after the silicon film melts, or with the silicon film maintained in the solid phase. Although not shown, the monocrystallization takes place easily if a piece of silicon film of SOI construction is brought into contact with the silicon substrate 10. Thereafter, a gate oxide film 12 and a gate 4 are deposited on the SOI layer 23, followed by the formation of an n A dynamic memory, in general, has peripheral circuits with various functions formed around the memory cell, and it is difficult to make the whole of the silicon substrate 10 n type. In this case, however, a doped layer may be provided as a plate, and only the portion of the memory cell need be n type. In this embodiment the groove has a simple rectangular shape, as shown in Fig. 1. Capacity increases with an increase in the surface area of the capacitor electrode 19. Therefore, the capacitor can be increased to more than that of a simple rectangular shape, while maintaining the same space. That is, the capacity can be increased by forming the groove in a comb shape or in two or more small grooves or in an annular groove. Therefore, individual steps can be replaced by others in a variety of ways. In all the embodiments, however, the common point remains that the side walls of the groove formed in the substrate are utilized as a capacitor part. The word line 4 has the form of a continuous gate within a memory cell array. It is, however, also possible to form polycrystalline silicon transfer gates of switching transistors that are not continuous, but are separate between memory cells, and connect the gates by the word line 4 using new contact holes. This makes it possible to achieve a high switching speed by using polycrystalline silicon gates which have heretofore been evaluated for their reliability, and by utilizing the advantage of the low resistance of aluminum. In the embodiment shown in the drawing, a transistor channel is 24 is formed in the vertical in the vertical direction within the SOI layer 23. The vertical junction transistor can be adapted to every kind of memory cell which employs SOI. As described in the beginning, the invention deals with the use of an n channel MOS transistor. To form a p channel transistor, impurities of the opposite conductivity type should be used. Namely, the phosphorus or arsenic ions should be replaced with boron or aluminum ions, and the boron ions should be replaced by phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony ions. In the semiconductor memory of the present invention, pairs of electrons and positive holes generated in large amounts by alpha particles within the silicon substrate seldom flow into the capacitor electrode 19 owing to its construction. With a semiconductor memory employing SOI, in parti cular, pairs of electrons and positive holes are not able to enter the capacitor electrode 19. Accordingly, the semiconductor memory according to the present invention is very stable against alpha particles.
