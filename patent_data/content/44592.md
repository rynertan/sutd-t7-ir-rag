# Synthetic resin bonded electromagnetic component and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic component on the basis of a sin tered, oxidic material having soft magnetic properties obtained by compressing in a mould sintered soft magnetic prefilled bodies, preferably having the shape of rods, in such manner that they are in contact with a part of their surfaces and filling the remaining cavities with a mixture of a synthetic resin binder with a soft magnetic powder.
