# MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium having two magnetic layers, which comprises an upper magnetic layer and a lower magnetic layer, said lower magnetic layer having a coercive force of at least 100 oersteds, preferably 100 to 500 oersteds, lower than that of the upper magnetic layer, the thickness of the upper and lower magnetic layers being in the ratio of the thickness of the upper magnetic layer to that of the lower magnetic layer of 1 1 to 1 9, and the total coercive force of the upper and lower magnetic layers being 1,000 oersteds or more. The mag netic recording medium has excellent sensitivity and frequency characteristics at low and high frequency bands with less noise.
