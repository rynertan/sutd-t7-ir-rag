## Description
Plastics pipe part provided with an insulating layer.This invention rolates to a plastics pipe part provided with an insulating layer, more particularly with a foom plastics insultating layer, the outer side of said layer being surrounded by a tubular sheath.Composite insulated pipe parts of this type are known in the art. These pipe parts consist of rather rigid materials, which materials, after a possible extrusion and cooling, rapidly set and obtain their definite, rigid, shape by cooling.However, for hot water lines plastics pipe parts are employed consisting of strongly postcrystalliring plastics, which plastics are in a rubberlike condition after their extrusion so that they may easily get damaged and or deformed. This holds particularly for polybutylene pipes, as said material is extraordinarily rubberlike after its extrusion and only gets its definite shape after a certain course of time by postcrystallization. This rubberlike state is very disadvan tageous as during a postcrystallization period, for example for a fortnight, the relative pipe may easily get damaged.Notwithstanding these disadvantages pipe parts of said type are preferred as after the postcrystallization period and obtaining their definite shape, they are still sufficiently flexible in order to give a pipe part any desired curvature during its instalment.The present invention aims to provide a pipe part of the aforementioned type, avoiding any risk of damage to said pipe part of postcrystallizing plastics, during its postcrystallization.This oil is attained according to the invention in that a tubular additional layer is present upon the outer side of the insulating layer covering a flexible plasti√ßs pipe part.By using said tubular additional layer the plastics pipe part being provided with the insulating layer, can be passed into the tubular sheath immediately after the extrusion and without deformation of the relative plastics pipe part, so that said pipe part is well protected during its post crystallization.Moreover, this measure allows the respective plastics pipe part to be provided with an insulating layer immediately after extrusion, so that it is not necessary to delay this step of insulation until the tube has obtained its definite shape by postcrystollization.Another advantageous effect of the present invention is that after postcrystallization, the plastics pipe part will be held in the insulating layer tensionless, so that the composite pipe os obtained may be reeled up for transport.The abovedescribed facts are especially of importance when hot water pipe lines have to be installed, as the number of couplings in such a circuit have to be kept as low as possible in order to restrict the risk of leakages. This involves that pipe parts having a length, ranging from approximately 100 to 200 meters hove to be used to that end. Transporting such straight lengths of pipes causes many problems. Immediately reeling up such pipe parts consisting of a strongly postcrystallizing plastics is not possible as e.g. fourteen days later on it is very difficult te regive such pipe parts a straight shape, while furthermore their cross section will then be oval instead of round.In a very advantqgeous embodiment the additional layer is a perforated layer, particularly of a knitted or woven tube.A knitted tube of thermoplastics is preferred as six tube may be clamped around the insulating layer.Very advantageously, the material of the knitted tube consists of a polyomide, since the use of said material provides very excellent results.When using the aforementioned tubular additional layer, a polybutylene pipe, not yet being fully set, and comprising a foam plastics insulating layer, surrounding said polybutylene pipe, may be passed into a flexible sheath, for instance consisting of polyethylene and particularly of high density polyethylene and the composite pipe may be subsequently reeled up after crystallization.After having transported said reeled up composite pipe to the site of instalment, the composite pipe is pulled from the reel and installed in a normal manner, while each desired curvature may be formed.The foam plastics insulating layer surrounding the plastics pipe part with strong postcrystallizing properties, more par ticularly a polybutylene pipe, is also flexible and may consist for instance of a polyethylene foam strip which has for example been helically wound around said polybutylene pipe, although said polyethylene foam strip may also possibly be folded around the tube, the edges of the strip being heatsealed or adhered to each other, by means of an adhesive. It is also possible to use a polyethylene foam strip provided with a zipper, thus affording said strip to be applied as a tubular foam insulation around the polybutylene pipe.The invention in another aspect relates to a method of manufacturing a plastics pipe part provided with an in insulating layer, more particularly a foam plastics insulating layer, the outer side of said layer being surrounded by a tubular sheath, whereby according to the invention a tubular additional layer is applied around an extruded flexible plastics pipe part surrounded by an insulating layer and the composite pipe is subsequently passed into a tubular sheath.The extruded plastics pipe part, more particularly a poly butyl no pipe, comprising an insulating layer surrounding same, is very conveniently passed through the internal space of an annular stock of a tubular additional layer, said pipe part with said insulating layer entr aining said additional layer.In view of the entraining of the additional layer, one end of said additional layer should preferably be closed off, for instance by knotting.The knotted end of said additional layer may then simultaneously serve as a seizing point for drawing means, which draw the relative pipe part with the foam plastics insulating layer surrounding same, through the tubular sheath and overcome the frictional forces occurring during this operation. The present invention will be illustrated with respect to an embodiment in the drawing, wherein Figure 1 is o perspective view of a pipe part in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a cross section through a pipe part according to the invention Figure 3 is an installation for manufacturing a pipe part in accordance with the invention.Fig. 1 shows a pipe part 1, consisting of polybutylene, which thermoplastics may be extruded in a manner known per se and may then be employed for transporting hot fluids. Polybutylene is a strongly postcrystallizing plastics.The polybutylene pipe 1 is surrounded by a foom plastics insulating layer 2consisting of a foam tape or strip 9 of polyethylene which has, for example, been helically wound around the polybutylene pipe. Surrounding said polybutylene pipe by a tape or strip of foamed polyethylene, may obviously also be obtained by connecting the edges of said polyethylene foam tape or strip with each other.Upon the outer side of the foom plastics insulating layer, a knitted nylon stocking 3 is disposed, the composite pipe then being surrounded by a tubular sheath 4, consisting of a high density polyethylene tube. It will be obvious that instead of polyethylene other plastics may be used for said tubular sheath 4, provided that said tubular sheath, the foam plastics insulating layer 2, and the pipe part 1 are flexible, so that the completed composite pipe may be given any desired curvature or bend on installing the same.As polybutylene pipes have a rather instable structure, due to extrusionyanextruer the rubberlike condition of polybutylene, it is recommended to manufacture the obovementioned pipe in a special manner, which proceeds as follows.In an extruder being fed through an inlet 6, polybutylene is plasticized and extruded as a polybutylene pipe 1, through an extrusion nozzle 7 of the extruder 5. This polybutylene pipe is then guided through a calibrating device 8, a cooling space and a drawing device in order to give the pipe a desired round shape and its desired dimensions.The polybutylene pipe 1 obtained after calibration still has a rubberlike structure and has to convert into its definite shape by postcrystallization. This means that said polybuty lene pipe 1 may be easily damaged or deformed at that moment.Subsequently the polybutylene pipe 1 is surrounded by a band or strip 9 of polyethylene foam from a storage reel 10, a welding device 11 interconnecting the adjoining edges of the band or strip of polyethylene foam by heatseoling. The pipe port, being surrounded by the foam plastics layer 2, still has an instable structure and is subsequently guided through a tubular chamber 12 having at the outer side a knitted nylon stocking.The end 14 of the knitted stocking 3 consisting of nylon filaments is closed off by swotting, subsequently the supplied polybutylene pipe 1 already comprising the foam plastics insulating layer 2, draws the upset knitted nylon stocking 3 from the outer side of chamber 12, said stocking then being tightly drawn onto the insulating layer 2, thus causing said insulating layer to be easily guided into a tubular sheath. The entire composite pipe consisting of the polybutylene pipe 1 the foam plastics insulating layer 2 surrounding the former, and the knitted nylon stocking 3 surrounding the foam plastics insulating layer 2, is subsequently guided into a tubular sheath consisting of polyethylene and more particularly of high density polyethylene.After filling of said polyethylene tube, for example over a length of approximately 200 m, with the composite pipe of polybutylene 1, the foam plastics insulating layer 2, and the nylon stocking 3, the knotted end 14 of the nylon stocking 3 is cut off, and the pipe so obtained is stored in order to let the polybutylene material postcrystallize in a normal manner and obtain its definite shape for its final instalment. Subsequently the composite pipe is reeled up.The use of the knitted nylon stocking 3 presents the additional important advantage that damaged parts of the foam plastics insulating layer 2, if any, are well enclosed, so that no problems will occur when the polybutylene pipe 1 with the foam plastics insulating layer 2 is passed into the tubular sheath 4.If said nylon stocking 3 is not used, parts of the foam plastics insulating layer, which hove not been optimally welded to one another, may be easily damaged by the front edge of the tubular sheath 4.It wil be obvious that, due to the presence of the knotted end 14 of the nylon stocking 3, a tensile stress may be exerted upon the composite pipe, by means of a drawing member 15, thus allowing the composite pipe to be easily drawn through the tubular sheath, and to maintain very high production speeds. Exerting a tensile stress may also easily overcome frictional forces between the polybutylene pipe provided with the plastics foam layer and the inner side of the tubular sheath. Afterrcrystollization the polybutylene tube 1 will be accommodated tensionless in the insulating layer forming part of the composite pipe part.It should be noted that the insulating layer is not compressed in a ready pipe part in accordance with the invention. Should, as a matter of fact, the insulating layer with the polybutylenepipe be reeled up immediately, after moulding, then said polybutylene pipe will not postcrystallize in a straight shape, thus causing the insulating layer to be locally compressed at the time when the polybutylene pipe is straightened to its final straight shape.
