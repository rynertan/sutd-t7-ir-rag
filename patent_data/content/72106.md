# Synthesis of intermediate for the manufacture of 5,6 dihydro 2 methyl N phenyl 1,4 oxathiin 3 carboxamide.

## Abstract
2 2 hydroxyethyl thio 3 oxo N phenylbutanamide, which is an intermediate useful in the manufacture of the fungi cide, 5,6 dihydro 2 methyl N phenyl 1,4 oxathiin 3 carboxa mide, is made by reaction of d 2 hydroxyethyl disulfide with acetoacetanilide in its ionized form. The intermediate may be cyclized to from the fungicide.
