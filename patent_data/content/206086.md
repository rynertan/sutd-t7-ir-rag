## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Active Energy Ray Curing Resin CompositionBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a resin composition which can be cured by irradiation of an active energy ray such as UV ray, electron beam, etc., particularly to an active energy ray curing type resin composition which is excellent in adhesion to a substrate such as glass, ceramics, plastic films, etc., chemical resistance and mechanical strength, also has high sensitivity and high resolution as the pattern forming material and is suitable for formation of a pattern comprising a cured film of high density. The active energy ray curing type resin composition is a resin composition which can be formed into a solid photosensitive sheet dry film .Related Background Art In recent years, active energy ray curing resins have been frequently used as coating materials, inks, sealing materials, resist materials, pattern forming materials. The active energy ray curing resins as the pattern forming material have been used for preparation of printing plates at the initial stage, but they have been recently utilized also for construction materials of precise instruments such as inkjet recording heads as disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application 43876 1982, in addition to utilization in the field of electronic industries such as print wirings, integrated circuits, etc. However, among the active energy ray curing resins used for pattern formation heretofore known, particularly among those of dry film type, there has been no resin excellent in adhesion to a substrate such as glass, ceramics or plastic films, etc. On the other hand, those which are known as photocurable type coating materials or adhesives to be used for glass, metals, ceramics, etc. are excellent in adhesion of the cured product, but irradiation of a strong active energy ray or prolonged time of irradiation is required, and yet they have not generally suitable properties for pattern formation. Thus, even if it is attempted to obtain a pattern by irradiating an active energy ray in a pattern by use of these materials and removing the non exposed portion by development, it was impossible to obtain a pattern of high precision and high resolution. As described above, in the prior art, there has been no material which is capable of forming a precise pattern with excellent adhesion on various substrates, and which pattern has also high durability as the construction material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an active energy ray curing resin composition which could not be accomplished by the active energy raycuring resin of the prior art as described above, which is excellent in adhesion to a substrate not only when used as a coating in liquid state on a substrate but also when used to be adhered in the form of dry film onto a substrate, has also high sensitivity to an active energy ray and can form a precise and high resolution pattern. Another object of the present invention is to provide an active energy ray curing resin composition, which can be formed into a dry film convenient for formation of a pattern, and can also give a pattern formed by curing with irradiation of an active energy ray and optional heating treatment which is excellent in chemical resistance and mechanical strength, and also has high durability as the construction material. According to the present invention, there is provided an active energy ray curing resin composition comprising the component i shown below and at least one of the components ii and iii shown below i a graft copolymerized polymer comprising a trunk chain composed mainly of structural units derived from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of alkyl methacrylates, acrylonitrile and styrene, having graft chains composed mainly of structural units derived from at least one monomer selected from A hydroxyl containing acrylic monomers, B amino or alkylamino containing acrylic monomers, C carboxylic containing acrylic or vinyl monomers, D N vinylpyrrolidone or its derivatives, E vinylpyridine or its derivatives and F acrylamide derivatives represented by the following formula I EMI4.1 wherein RÃš represents hydrogen or an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and R2 represents hydrogen or an alkyl or acyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may have hydroxy group. , added to said trunk chain ii a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated bond iii a resin comprising an epoxy resin comprising at least one compound having two or more epoxy groups in the molecule, the epoxy groups existing in said epoxy resin being partially esterified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The graft copolymerized polymer i which is the essential component of the active energy ray curing resin composition of the present invention comprises a trunk chain having relatively rigid properties suitable for a structural material having graft chains composed mainly of the above monomers A F having hydrophilic property and exhibiting excellent adhesion to the substrate added thereto.

Examples of the amino or alkylamino containing acrylic monomer of B include meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminopropyl meth acrylamide,N,N di t butylaminoethyl meth acrylamide and the like.

Also, to the above monomers A F , monomer which can be crosslinked by ring opening by heat such as glycidyl meth acrylate may be partially added to constitute the graft chains, whereby the same effect as in the above F can be obtained. In addition to the above thermal crosslinking, for the same purpose, it is also effective to crosslink the graft copolymerized polymer with an active energy ray by introducing a photopolymerizable monomer into a part of the graft chains of the graft copolymer in the present invention. As the method for imparting photopolymerizability to the graft chain, there may be employed for example, the method in which a carboxyl containing monomer exemplified by meth acrylic acid, etc. , or an amino or tertiary amine containing monomer is copolymerized, followed by the reaction with glycidyl meth acrylate, etc. the method in which a partial urethane compound of polyisocyanate having one isocyanate group and one or more acrylic ester groups in one molecule is reacted with the hydroxyl group, amino group or carboxyl group in the graft chain the method in which acrylic acid chloride is reacted with the hydroxyl groups in the graft chain the method in which an acid anhydride is reacted with the hydroxyl group in the graft chain, followed by the reaction with glycidyl meth acrylate the method in which the hydroxyl group in the graft chain is condensed with the condensing crosslinkable monomer as exemplified in F , thereby leaving acrylamide group in the side chain the method in which the hydroxyl group in the graft chain is reacted with glycidyl meth acrylate etc. When the graft chain of the graft copolymerized polymer in the present invention is heat crosslinkable, it is preferable to perform heating after formation of a pattern by irradiation of an active energy ray.On the other hand, also when the above graft chain is photopolymerizable, there is no problem in performing heating within the range permissible in aspect of heat resistance of the substrate, and rather preferable results can be given by heating. The graft chains are not limited to those derived only from the hydrophilic monomers as exemplified by the above A F , but the graft chains may also contain various hydrophobic monomers which can exhibit various other functions as the copolymer component within the range of 0 to about 25 weight . The monomer constituting the trunk chain of the graft copolymerized polymer in the present invention is an alkyl methacrylate having I to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, t butyl methacrylate, etc., acrylonitrile and styrene.

In the composition of the present invention, the above trunk chain gives high cihesive strength to the composition. The composition of the present invention can be provided in various shapes depending on the purpose of uses such as solutions or solid films, etc. However, when it is practically used as the dry film, it is preferable to use a relatively rigid trunk chain having a glass transition temperature of about 50 C or higher in order to maintain the composition in shape of a film. In this application, the trunk chain to be used may be constituted of two or more kinds having different glass transition temperatures.On the other hand, when the composition of the present invention is to be used as a solution, it is possible to use a trunk chain having a low glass transition temperature so as to give the composition flexibility.However, also in this case, in order to obtain a pattern having excellent chemical resistance and high mechanical strength, it is preferable to use a trunk chain having a high glass transition temperature. The graft copolymerized polymers to be used in the present invention may be classified broadly into those having no curability, those having photopolymerizability and those having heat crosslinkability.

The monomer ii having an ethylenically unsaturated bond to be used in the resin composition of the present invention is a component for permitting the resin composition of the present invention to exhibit curability with an active energy ray, particularly imparting excellent sensitivity to an active energy ray to the resin composition of the present invention, preferably having a boiling point of 100 C or higher under atmospheric pressure, having two or more ethylenically unsaturated bonds, and various known monomers curable by irradiation of an active energy ray can be used.

While various unsaturated carboxylic acids can be used for half esterification of the epoxy resin, it is preferable for imparting better curability with an activation energy to the resin composition of the present invention to use a monobasic unsaturated carboxylic acid hiving an acrylic or methacrylic vinyl group on at least one terminal end of the molecule and a carboxyl group on the other terminal end. Typical examples of such unsaturated carboxylic acid may include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, and it is also possible to use a monoester compound obtained by the reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a meth acrylic acid ester having one hydroxyl group. The above dicarboxylic acid may include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, isosebacic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid and anhydrydes thereof.

Thus, if the esterification ratio of the epoxy groups with the unsaturated carboxylic acid in the half esterified epoxy resin is higher than the above range, good chemical resistance or dimensional stability derived from the epoxy resin cannot be effectively exhibited in the resin composition of the present invention. On the contrary, if the esterification ratio is lower than the above range, pattern forming characteristic when using the resin composition of the present invention for formation of a pattern comprising a cured film will be worsened.To describe in more detail, even if the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds as mentioned above may be used to an extent which does not impair the characteristic of the cured film, in other words, in the increased amount possible within the range shown in the present invention, polymerization degree in polymerization by pattern exposure is low to give only a product with low contrast in solubility in the developer, with the result that no sharpness can be obtained at the outline portion of the pattern and the working conditions for obtaining a sharp pattern become extremely narrow. As described above, the active energy ray curing resin composition of the present invention, in addition to having the high sensitivity and satisfactory curability to the active energy ray based on unsaturated double bonds possessed by the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds and or the halfesterified epoxy resin iii contained as the components, has also heat curability based on the epoxy groups possessed by the half esterified epoxy resin iii when containing the half esterified epoxy resin iii .For example, a cured film obtained by curing by irradiation of an active energy ray on the resin composition of the present invention, followed by further heat curing by heating at 80 C or higher for about 10 minutes to 3 hours, can be further endowed with good adhesiveness with the substrate, chemical resistance, dimensional stability, etc., derived from the epoxy resin The active energy ray to be used for curing of the active energy ray curing resin composition of the present invention may include ultraviolet rays UVrays or electron beams which have widely been practically applied.As the UV ray light source, there may be employed high pressure mercury lamps, ultra high pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps, etc., enriched in light with wavelength of 250 nm to 450 nm, preferably those which can give a light intensity of about 1 mW cm2 to 100 mW cm2 at the wavelength in the vicinity of 365 nm at a distance between the lamp and the material to be irradiated which is practically permissible.

When the resin composition of the present invention contains both of the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds ii and the half esterified epoxy resin iii , it is preferable that the content ratio of both components in the resin composition of the present invention may be 30 70 to 70 30, in order to exhibit effectively the characteristics of the both components. More specifically, the half esterified epoxy resin iii is effective for approximating the physical properties of the cured film such as adhesiveness, chemical resistance and dimensional stability to the excellent physical properties of the epoxy resin cured film, while the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds ii is effective for imparting high sensitivity to an activation energy to the resin composition, respectively. If the content ratio of the components ii and iii is within the range as specified above, a resin composition and a cured film from the composition endowed with the properties of both components can be obtained.In contrast, if the content of the half esterified epoxy resin iii is higher than the above range, the content of the component participating directly in curability to the active energy ray in the resin composition is not sufficient, whereby in the case of pattern formation, polymerization degree in polymerization by pattern exposure becomes lower, with the result that no sharpness can be obtained at the outline portion of the pattern, and also the working conditions for obtaining a sharp pattern become extremely narrow.Further, when the content of the half esterified epoxy resin iii is lower than the above range, the contents of the epoxy groups in the resin composition becomes smaller, with the result that polymerization reaction by heating after exposure can occur with difficulty, whereby excellent characteristics such as adhesion to the substrate, chemical resistance, dimensional stability, etc., cannot be fully exhibited. When a radical polymerization initiator capable of being activated by the action of an activation energy ray is used in the resin composition of the present invention, the polymerization initiator may be used in an amount within the range from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin components comprising the graft copolymerized polymer and the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds and or the half esterified epoxy resin i. ii or i iii or i ii iii When a photosensitive aromatic onium salt containing an element belong to the group VIa or the group Va is used, the content of the compound may be 0.2 to 15 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin components comprising the graft copolymerized polymer and the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds and or the half esterified epoxy resin t i ii or i iii or i ii iii As the solvent to be used when employing the active energy ray curing resin composition of the present invention in the form of a solution or when coating the composition on a plastic film which is a film substrate in formation of a dry film, hydrophilic solvents such as alcohols, glycol ethers, glycol esters, etc., may be employed.Of course, it is also possible to use mixtures comprising these hydrophilic solvents as the main component, mixed optionally at appropriate proportions with ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc., esters such as ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, etc., aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, etc., and their halogen derivatives, aliphatic solvents containing chlorine such as methylene chloride, 1,1,1trichloroethane, etc. These solvents can be also used as the developer for the composition of the present invention.

The above substrate was also dipped in an aqueous NaOH solution of pH 12.0, equipped with electrodes and electrolytic cleaning was performed under the conditions of a voltage of 10 V and a current of 1 A dm2 for 2 minutes. For the substrate, the cross cut tape peel off test was performed to obtain the result of i00 100, and no peel off was observed at all even at the pattern portion which had acted as the resist film for electrolytic washing, thus exhibiting high alkali resistance. The above substrate was also dipped in a soldering mixture at 260 C composed of 60 g Pb and 40 Sn for 15 seconds to apply solder plating at the exposed portion of the copper foil. For the substrate, the cross cut tape peel off test was performed to obtain the result of 100 100, and no peel off was observed at all even a the pattern portion which had acted as the resist film for solder plating. Thus, it was found that the substrate exhibited satisfactory heat resistance as the solder resist.Example 10 Example 9 was repeated except for using 60 parts by weight of 2,2 bis 4 acryloxydiethoxy phenyl propane in place of 60 parts by weight of neopentyl glycol diacrylate to obtain an active energy raycurable resin composition. By use of the resin composition, a pattern was formed on the substrate in entirely the same manner as Example 9 and subjected to adhesion test according to the cross cut tape peel off test before and after the acid resistance, alkali resistance and solder resistance tests. As the results, excellent durability and adhesion strength were exhibited in all of the tests similarly as Example 9.Example 11 Example 9 was repeated except for using 60 parts by weight of trimethylolpropane triacrylate in place of 60 parts by weight of neopentyl glycol diacrylate to obtain an active energy ray curable resin composition. By use of the resin composition, a pattern was formed on the substrate in entirely the same procedure as Example 9 and subjected to adhesion test according to the cross cut tape peel off test before and after the acid resistance, alkali resistance and solder resistance tests. As the results, excellent durability and adhesion s trength were exhibited in all of the tests similarly as Example 9.Example 12 Example 9 was repeated except for using 60 parts by weight of Aronix M 8030 1 trade name of polyester acrylate produced by Toa Gosei Kagaku K.K. in place of 60 parts by weight of neopentyl glycol diacrylate to obtain an active energy ray curable resin composition. By use of the resin composition, a pattern was formed on the substrate in entirely the same manner asExample 9 and subjected to adhesion test according to the cross cut tape peel off test before and after the acid resistance, alkali resistance and solder resistance tests. As the results, excellent durability and adhesion strength were exhibited in all of the tests similarly as Example 9.Example 13 According to the same procedure as Example 9, by use of 250 g of Epicron N 665 novolac type epoxy resin, epoxy equivalent of 200 to 230, produced byDainippon Ink Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , acrylic acid was allowed to react therewith so that the mols of epoxy groups mols of acrylic acid became 10 5. Thus, a partially esterified product of Epicron N 665 with acrylic acid was obtained this is called HE 2 . By use of the graft copolymerized polymer GP 2 having heat crosslinkability and the partial acrylic acid esterified product HE 2, an active energy raycuring resin composition was prepared as follows GP 2 graft copolymerized polymer 100 parts by weight HE 2 epoxy partial ester 80 H Neopentyl glycol diacrylate 60 H Urethane acrylate 2 60 parts by weight Benzophenone 12 N Michler s ketone 6 N Crystal Violet 1 P toluenesulfonic acid 3 Methyl ethyl ketone toluene 400 N 1 1 mixture 2 Urethane acrylate obtained by reacting PPG 400, isophorone diisocyanate and 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate at mols of OH groups of PPG 400 mols of OH groups of isophorone diisocyanate mols of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate 2 4 2. The above composition was applied on a 16 pm polyethyleneterephthalate film Lumilar T type by a bar coater to obtain a resin laminate film with a thickness after drying of about 50 pom. Drying was carried out in a hot air oven at 100 C for 10 minutes.A Pyrex glass substrate was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning with the use of Difronw detergent produced by Daikin Kogyo K.K. and dried at 120 C for 30 minutes. On the glass substrate was laminated the above resin laminate film according to the same method as Example 9. Following subsequently the procedure as example 9, a relief pattern for resolution pattern was formed. A sharp pattern of 50 pm lines and intervals was found to be formed on the Pyrex glass substrate. The substrate was applied with post cure with the same intensity as Example 9 and also with heat cure at 150 C for 30 minutes. After the post cure, the pattern on the substrate was found to become a rigid coating film. The substrate obtained was subjected to the cross cut tape peel off test, whereby high adhesion of 100 100 was exhibited. The above substrate was also subjected to pressure cooker test by dipping in an aqueous HC1 solution of pH 1.5 2 atm. , 121 C, 10 hours .Then, the cross cut tape peel off test was conducted to obtain the result that adhesion of 100 100 was maintained, thus exhibiting high acid resistance. The above substrate was also subjected to pressure cooker test by dipping in an aqueous NaOH solution of pH 10.0 2 atm. , 121 C, 10 hours .Then, the cross cut tape peel off test was conducted to obtain the result that adhesion of 100 100 was maintained, thus exhibiting high acid resistance.Example 14 Example 13 was repeated except for using 60 parts by weight of 2,2 bis 4 acryloxydiethoxy phenyl propane in place of 60 parts by weight of neopentyl glycol diacrylate to obtain an active energy raycurable resin composition. By use of the resin composition, a pattern was formed on the substrate in entirely the same manner asExample 9 and subjected to adhesion test according to the cross cut tape peel off test before and after the pressure cooker tests under the acidic, alkaline conditions. As the results, excellent durability and adhesion strength were exhibited in all of the tests similarly as Example 9.Comparative example 3 An active energy ray curing resin composition was prepared and a pattern was formed in entirely the same manner as Example 9 except for using LP 1 in place of GP 1. The pattern obtained was found to have substantially the same resolution as Example 9. However, when boiling test was conducted in an aqueous NaOH solution of pH 9.0 for 4 hours, peel off of the pattern occurred from the substrate before initiation of the peel off test, thus exhibiting low water resistance and adhesion. As is apparent from Examples and Comparative examples as described above, the active energy raycuring resin composition of the present invention can form a pattern of high resolution simultaneously with having high adhesion to the substrate, particularly considerably high adhesion when employing a graft copolymerized polymer having crosslinkability, and also has excellent mechanical strength as well as chemical resistance.
