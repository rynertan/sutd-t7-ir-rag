# Vinyl chloride polymerisation process.

## Abstract
Process for the polymerisation of vinyl chloride in aque ous suspension or microsuspension using an organo solu ble free radical yielding initiator wherein the initiator is progressively activated during polymerisation by the pro gressively activated during polymerisation by the progres sive reduction of a non initiator activating water soluble metal chelate complex to an initiator activating form of the complex which is otherwise substantially stable under the polymerisation conditions in which the metal is in a lower oxidation state, preferably a one or two lower oxidation state.
