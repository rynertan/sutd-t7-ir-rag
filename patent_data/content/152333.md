# CARDIAC ATRIAL PEPTIDES

## Abstract
A DNA fragment encoding at least part of the ANF protein has been molecularly cloned and its nucleotide sequence partially determined. The composition and sequ ence of a peptide containing 116 amino acids within the ANF gene have been determined. Biologically active subunit peptides have been identified.
