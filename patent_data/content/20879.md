# Optical electronic distance sensor.

## Abstract
An optical electronic distance sensor utilizes a V light barrier in which a light transmitter 11 transmits a substantially parallel light beam 14 at a defined angle α and a light receiver 12 receives a substantially parallel light beam 15 at a defined angle α and delivers an electrical output signal dependent on the intensity of the received light beam. The distance of the intersection 29 of the transmitted and received light beam paths 27, 28, i.e. the apex of the V, from the light transmitter 11 and receiver 12 defines the sensing distance 26 of the light barrier and is adjusted by adjusting the separation of the light transmitter 11 and receiver 12. For this purpose the light transmitter 11 and receiver 12 are displaceably mounted on a mounting rail 13. The distanze sensor is particularly useful in indoor carparks for determining the presence or absence of a vehicle in a parking space.
