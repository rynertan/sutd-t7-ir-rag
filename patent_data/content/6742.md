## Description
Woven carpet backings and carpets incorporating same This invention relates to fabrics for use as carpet backings and also to yarns for incorporation therein. Carpets have traditionally been made using woven fabric backings incorporating spun natural fibre weft yarns, generally yarns derived from jute or flax. Recently, such natural fibre weft yarns have been increasingly replaced by synthetic yarns, as the use of such synthetic yarns is often more economical and also possesses technical advantages. Synthetic weft yarns incorporated into woven carpet backings for use in the manufacture of carpets, for example Axminster and Wilton carpets, should in general give the carpets the following properties a a good weaving efficiency b a good dimensional stability so that, for example, the carpet does not contract in width during the weaving operation and c carpets containing the weft yarns should not contract in width during the drying cycle which normally follows the application of latex to the back of the woven carpet. Producing carpets having the first of these properties has proved to be relatively straight forward by using fibrillated polypropylene weft yarns, and such yarns give good weaving performance in Axminster or Wilton carpets. However, such polypropylene yarns have a much higher extensibility than the jute yarns which they replace and therefore give an unacceptable carpet width contraction during the weaving operation. Another disadvantage of these yarns is their high thermal shrinkage, often exceeding 2 at 130 0C. Traditionally,Axminster and Wilton carpets were finished by back sizing with a conventional starch preparation. This treatment locked the pile into position and did not require the application of large amounts of heat to the back of the carpet during a drying cycle.However, with the substitution of natural fibre yarns in the backings with polypropylene yarns, carpet manufacturers discovered that the count or thickness of the weft yarn could be dramatically reduced due to the superior strength of such yarns. This enabled the weaver to use yarns of a smaller diameter which in turn meant that the backing fabric into which the pile was woven was lighter. These lighter backing fabrics gave a poorer tuft lock and were found to be unacceptable. In order to obviate these disadvantages, the carpets have been back coated with a latex preparation.While such coating stiffened the carpet to a suitable extent and gave excellent tuft lock, it required the carpet to be subjected to a prolonged heating cycle during the drying of the latex. This prolonged heating cycle, for example at temperatures up to about 1300C, required the polyprqpylene weft yarns to exhibit virtually no shrinkage at this temperature. It was found that the extensibility and shrinkage problems in polypropylene weft yarns could be avoided if about 20 polyethylene was added to the polypropylene polymer and the orientated yarns made from this polymer combination were subjected to draw ratios in excess of 20 1. Such yarns exhibit extensibilities comparable to jute yarns and shrinkages of less than 1.0 at 1300C.This discovery has led to the acceptance of fibrillated polypropylene yarns as suitable substitutes for jute and flax yarns. The above described fibrillated polypropylene weft yarns exhibit the desired properties mentioned above and have therefore been substituted for jute or flax in carpet backings. However, in practice these synthetic yarns have not gained considerable acceptance in the carpet making industry. Thus, the woven carpet industry in the United Kingdom at present uses about 30,000 tonnes per annum of jute weft yarn but only about 5,000 tonnes per annum of polypropylene weft yarns. By comparison in the chain and stuffer warp yarn market, polypropylene yarn constitutes between 80 and 90 of the usage. Fibrillated polypropylene weft yarns are therefore not an outstanding commercial success and jute still possesses many excellent properties. At the present time, the cost of fibrillated polypropylene yarns are typically 15 25 less expensive on an equal length basis than the jute yarns they seek to replace. This, at first sight, is a surprising situation, as polypropylene yarns can give the weaver less dust, longer runnage per weft supply package, higher weaving efficiency and a substantially stronger carpet. It is believed that the main stumbling block to increased penetration of the jute yarn market by polypropylene yarns is their stiffness. Carpets woven from polypropylene weft yarns are substantially stiffer than carpets woven from jute yarns. The reason for the stiffness is an interaction of the following factors a the high draw ratios used to produce polypropylene weft yarn leads to the yarns having a very high modulus b the fibril denier in present day fibrillated poly propylene yarns is greater than the fibril denier in a jute yarn.While the fibril denier in polypropy lene yarns can be reduced by increased fibrillation, this leads to hairy yarns which give impaired weaving performance c the weaving action of the carpet loom causes the polypropylene yarns to roll up into an approximately circular cross section and when the carpet is sub sequently back coated with latex the weft yarns are encapsulated by the latex, transforming them more or less into rigid mono filaments and c latexed carpets made with jute weft yarns feel soft when they are bent or folded parallel to the weft yarns. The individual fibres comprising the weft yarn can slip relative to one another with very little effort and there is also almost no restoring force resisting one s attempts to bend the carpet. On the other hand, when using a polypropylene weft there can be no fibril slippage and there is a marked restoring force.Consequently, such carpets when bent parallel to the weft yarns, feel stiff and springy. The following methods have been considered for producing carpet backings incorporating synthetic weft yarns whereby the resulting carpet can be made softer a Increasing the width of the tape from which the fibrillated yarn is made. This makes the tape thinner and consequently effectively reduces the fibril denier without recourse to increasing the fibrillation ratio.This solution is not, however, acceptable to carpet producers as the process increases the cost of the yarn due to a reduction in the extrusion output. b Substituting the fibrillated weft yarns by continuous or ps√©udo continuous filament yarns. Once again such a subsitution is relatively expensive and is therefore unacceptable to carpet producers. Another problem with continuous filament yarns is that they tend to have higher extensibilities than fibrillated yarns which will lead to width contraction problems during the weaving operation. c Reducing the draw ratio of the fibrillated weft yarn to reduce its modulus and give a somewhat softer carpet at the end of the processing cycle. This change in processing conditions will actually make the yarns less expensive, as it is usually possible to increase the output when the draw ratio is reduced. However, as the draw ratio is reduced the yarn extensibility increases and the amount of width contraction experienced at weaving also increases to an unacceptable level. It has been now found that it is possible to produce softer carpets compared to those produced from carpet backings incorporating conventional polypropylene weft yarns while at the same time avoiding the above difficulties. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a woven carpet backing in which at least a part of the weft comprises ribbons which have been formed by extruding and subsequently stretching a thermoplastic polymer composition comprising polypropylene, characterised in that the thermoplastic polymer composition additionally contains at least one blowing agent which results in a foamed ribbon product. The yarns may, if desired, be subjected to a step of fibrillation and or may additionally be subjected to a heatsetting operation. It will be understood that the foamed ribbon products produced may be produced individually by extrusion or may be produced by slitting a film of extruded foamed polymer composition. The carpet backings of the present invention are primarily intended for woven carpets of the Axminster,Wilton or Brussels type and thus will be formed directly with the facing pile fibres. However carpet backing fabrics for tufted carpets are also intended to be within the scope of the invention, and in this case the carpet backing will be woven and subsequently tufted with the facing pile fibres. In the carpet backings according to the invention for use in woven carpets preferably all of the weft yarns comprise fibrillated yarns produced from foamed thermoplastic polymer ribbons. The weft yarns incorporated into the carpet backings according to the present invention formed from foamed polypropylene containing ribbons have a reduced modulus which results in softer carpets. In addition, the addition of the blowing agent to the ribbons does not result in a significant cost increase and has the further advantage that the specific gravity of the yarns is reduced enabling the use of lighter yarns for a given thickness to be incorporated into the backings. The weft yarns for the backings of the invention may be produced by conventional techniques for ribbon yarn production with the exception that a blowing agent is introduced into the thermoplastic polymer composition prior to extrusion. The thermoplastic polymer may comprise polypropylene as the sole polymer in association with conventional additives e.g. pigments, anti oxidants and extruding agents, but may conveniently additionally incorporate a minor amount of afurther thermoplastic polymer. Thus, one may use a thermoplastic polymer composition comprising polypropylene together with up to 20 by weight of low density polyethylene. Suitable blowing agents which may be useed in the production of the yarns for use in the carpet backings of the present invention are inert gases or volatile liquids which will vaporise at the extrusion temperature or alternatively chemical blowing agent systems, that is those which incorporate compounds which react or decompose at the extrusion temperature to evolve a vapour, gas or mixture of vapours and or gases which are inert to the thermoplastic polymer composition.Examples of such blowing agents and blowing agent systems are azo compounds, such as azodicarbonamide and barium azodicarboxylate N nitroso compounds, such as dinitrosopentamethyenediamine sulphonyl hydrazides sulphonyl semicarbazides carbonates, such as sodium and ammonium carbonate, optionally together with a weak acid, such as tartaric or citric acid gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide aliphatic hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, isobutylene and the like ethers, such as diethyl ether ketones, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone and lower alkyl halides, such as methyl chloride, trichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, 1,2 dichlorotetrafluoroethane, l,l,l trifluoroethane, ethylidene fluoride, perfluoropropane, 2,2 difluoropropane and octafluorocyclobutane. In general, it is considered that the yarns formed from the foamed ribbons should have a specific gravity in the range of from 0.55 to 0.8 in order to give backings of the desired characteristics. Thus, the amount of blowing agent used in the thermoplastic polymer composition should be selected to give a yarn with a density in this range. For example, when using azodicarbonamide as the blowing agent, this may be present in an amount of about 0.2 by weight referred to the total thermoplastic polymer composition. The thermoplastic polymer composition together with the added blowing agent may be extruded in conventional ribbon or tape forming apparatus. We have found that the extrusion die temperature should, in general, not exceed about 260 0C when using azodicarbonamide otherwise a foamed ribbon is formed in which the cellular structure is too coarse. After extrusion, the foamed ribbon is then subjected to a stretching operation, generally with a draw ratio of up to about 15 1. The stretched ribbon may be subjected to a heatsetting operation to reduce the thermal shrinkage of the yarn product. If desired, the stretched ribbon may be subjected to a step of fibrillation prior to any heatsetting operation to give a fibrillated yarn for incorporation into the backings of the invention. The fibrillated yarns formed from foamed ribbons described above form a further aspect of the invention and exhibit substantially reduced moduli compared to the hitherto used yarns produced from unfoamed ribbons, and therefore carpet backings produced therefrom give softer and more acceptable woven carpets. The warp of the woven carpet backings according to the invention may be any conventional warp yarn for this purpose. For example, it may comprise spun jute, spun cotton, spun viscose, fibrillated polypropylene tape yarn, twisted polypropylene tape yarn, or multifilament synthetic fibre e.g.of polyester or polypropylene. Alternatively, it may be a ribbon yarn as defined according to the invention, particularly a fibrillated ribbon yarn. According to another aspect, the invention also provides a carpet incorporating a carpet backing according to the present invention. Thus, carpets may be formed by weaving or tufting a suitable face fabric with the carpet backings according to the invention by conventional techniques. After weaving or tufting the carpets may be backed using latex to lock the carpet tufts to the backing as is usual in the art. The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention Example 1 A thermoplastic polymer composition containing 0.2 by weight of azodicarbonamide, 25kg polypropylene m.f.i. 4.5 x 10 1 g.min , 2.2kg low density poly l l ethylene m.f.i. 0.3 x 10 1 g.min 1 and 0.34 kg of a brown pigment master batch, is extruded in sheet form using an extruder having a barrel temperature of 200 2600C, a die temperature of 2600C and a water temperature of 300C.The extrudate is split into ribbons and the ribbon is l passed to a first godet roll set at a speed of 13 m.min After leaving the first godet roll set, the ribbon is passed to a first oven having a temperature of 2000C and then to a second godet roll set at a speed of 160 m.min 1. The ribbon is then passed to a second oven having a temperature of 180 0C and then to a third godet roll set l at a speed of 150 m.min 1. The speed difference between the godet roll sets imparts the required degree of stretching and orientation to the resulting yarn. The overall draw ratio imparted to the yarn was 11.5 1, as measured by the ratio of the speeds of the yarn through the third godet roll set to that through the first godet roll set. The percentage relaxation applied to the yarn is given by the equation 100 speed godet 2 speed godet 3 speed godet 2 and, in this Example, equals 6.3. After passing from the third godet roll set, the yarn is then passed over a pin roll rotating at a speed of 900 rpm to fibrillate the yarn, the arc of contact of yarn to the pin roll is 3 rows of pins. The following Table sets out the properties of the fibrillated yarn thus produced.Examples 2 and 3 Fibrillated yarns are produced in like manner toExample 1 using the thermoplastic polymer compositions and processing conditions set out in the following Table.Comparison Example A fibrillated yarn was produced in like manner toExample 1 using the composition and processing conditions set out in the following Table.
