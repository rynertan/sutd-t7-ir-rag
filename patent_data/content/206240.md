## Description
The present invention relates to a solid pharmaceutical preparation and more particularly relates to a solid pharmaceutical preparation for oral use containing Carnitine and Lecithin. L Carnitine is a natural constituent of striated muscle and liver and is used in therapeutic field as an antilyperlipoproteinemic agent, in Duchenne and Beker s muscular dystrophia, in cases of general muscular deficiency, in cases of myocardium ischemia, in such pathologies of liver and spleen and as a prompt source of energy for rapid utilization. L Carnitine is an extremely hygroscopic and deliquescent,very soluble white powder, with a characteristic saline and anesthetic taste. A similar behaviour has been found as to D,L Carnitine, L Acetylcarnitine, D,L Acetylcarnitine and other acyl derivatives.In the present invention with the termCarnitine we intend to refer to L Carnitine as well as to D,L Carnitine and to the corresponding acyl derivatives or to pharmaceutically acceptable salts.Lecithin is a natural phospholipid from seedsof clovers such as soybean, or from egg yolk, and it is used in therapeutic field as a lipotropic agent. Lecithin is an oil or a sticky greasy powder, with a characteristic taste and smell, easily oxidizable going rancid by W radiation as well as by atmospheric oxygen. The contemporaneous administration of Carnitine and Lecithin does not give a synergistic effect between the substances which instead perform their specific actions separately.Nevertheless, their action may be considered as complementary since Carnitine is a corroborant for the muscular system andLecithin is a corroborant for the nervous system.The association of Carnitine and Lecithin, for its character of nervous muscular corroborant, appears to be suitable for the treatment where there is an increased need of muscular energy, or in cases of psychophysical asthenia, of debilitating chronic diseases and in the periods of convalescence.The Swiss Patent No. 637,295 in the name of Claudio Cavazza describes a liquid composition for parenteral administration containing triglycerides for instance egg Lecithin and Carnitine and suitable for the treatment of patients in state of shock or which have undergone a trauma.In the case of liquid compositions intended for parenteral or intravenous route, such as, for instance, the compositions described in the above Swiss Patent, the administration of the drug is often a long complex operation that generally cannot be performed by the patient himself but only in hospitals.Then, whenever possible, it is preferred to have available an orally ingestible solid pharmaceutical preparation for instance a tablet or a sugar coated tablet because the patient can take the drug directly at pre established doses and intervals.Carnitine is a hygroscopic deliquescent substance while Lecithin is hygroscopic and easily oxidable in the light.These unfavourable characteristics essentially prevent the use of solid pharmaceutical preparations of the traditional type which contain such an assnciation becauses Carnitine causes, in very short time, phenomena of physical degradation of the solid pharmaceutical preparations swelling and disintegration andLecithin, in contact with air and light, goes rancid making the specialities unsuitable for consumption.The problems of physical stability and of conservation of these traditional solid pharmaceutical preparations become practically insunmoutable in case of retail sales by the pharmacist as this inevitably involves storage periods of the packed drug. We have now found that by thorough mixing of Carnitine and Lecithin with a substance selected among shellac, rosin, turpentine, cellulose acetate phtalate, polyacrylamidic resin or mixtures thereof, and usual excipients and additives, it is possible to prepare solid pharmaceutical preparations, for instance chewable tablets, which are physically stable for a long period of time and in which the association Carnitine Lecithin remains unaltered for a period of three years or more under usual storage conditions.Therefore, object of the present invention are solid pharmaceutical preparations for oral use consisting of Carnitine, Lecithin and usual excipients and additives and characterized in that they also contain an amount, comprised between 1 and 60 weight by weight preferably between 3 and 5 w w with respect to Carnitine plus Lecithin, of a substance selected among shellac, rosin, turpentine, cellulose acetate phtalate, polyacrylamidic resin or mixtures thereof.The above solid pharmaceutical preparations in the form of chewable tablets are a preferred embodiment of the invention.For the sake of brevity the substances characterizing the invention, that is shellac, rosin, turpentine, cellulose acetate phtalate, polyacrylamidic resin or mixtures thereof, will be indicated below by the term stabilizers .The term stabilizer related to these compounds irk the present application indicates that they are able to physically stabilize the solid pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention. While on the one hand it is essential that the stabilizing substance be used in a thorough mixture with Carhitine, Lecithin and the other components, it is also possible to use part of this stabilizer to externally coat the solid pharmaceutical preparation especially when this is a not sugar coated chewable tablet.The usable excipients and additives in the solid pharmaceutical preparations of the invention comprise the usual diluents, binders, disintegrants, lubrificants, flavouring agents, sweetening agents and coloring agents usable in the preparation of solid pharmaceutical compositions.In the case of chewable tablets suitable excipients and additives able to ensure good characteristics of palatability to the tablets will be selected.Some specific examples of these compounds are, among the diluents, saccharose, sorbitol, lactose and generally mono or polysaccharides, among the lubrificants, alkaline or alkaline heart stearates, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and, besides the flavouring agents or auxiliary flavouring agents, such as natural or natural like flavors, ascorbic acid or citric acid, and sweetening agents like sugars or cyclamar zs, sacs aren a.a aspaltaee. Clearly, also in the case of chewable tablets, it will be necessary to use binders and disintegrants such as starch, variously substituted celluloses, polyethylene glycols, silicon dioxide, polyvinylpyrrolidinone and so on. Then the compositions may contain natural coloring agents such as carotenes and ferric oxide, or pharmaceutically acceptable artificial coloring agents.The preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention does not present any particular difficulty. The thorough mixing of Carnitine, Lecithin, excipients and additives with the stabilizer according to the present invention may be carried out by usual techniques of mixing, compression or granulation of the different components, after which a further coating with the selected stabilizing agent may follow.This last operation may be carried out by an usual apparatus for film coating pan, fluid bed . If desired, the tablets so prepared may then be sugar coated with sugary syrups or with a film of coating and opacizing substances.For example a chewable tablet according to the present invention with a weight of 1.5 2 g consists of from 5 to 15 w w of Carnitine or a derivative thereof from 10 to 40 w w of Lecithin, from 1 to 5 w w of stabilizer, the rest to 100 w w being constituted by usual pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives which comprise, as above reported, diluents, lubrificants, binders, disintegrants, flavoring agents and sweetening agents.If the diluent consists of a sugar saccharose, lactose, sorbitol and so on the use of sweetening agents may be unnecessary.The number of tablets to be administered daily will be decided by the physician also in relation to different factors connected with the condition of the patient.The daily amount of tablets to be administered will be also in relation to the fact that the daily dose of Carnitine is generally comprised between 400 and 2000 mg and the dose of Lecithin between 1500 and 6000 mg, however, higher dosages being acceptable according to the individual needs.In order to better illustrate the invention without limiting it the following examples are now given.Example 1A homogenous mixture of the following ingredients L,Carnitine 150 gLecithin 500 gShellac 40 gSorbitol 550 gSilicon dioxide 40 gMagnesium stearate 17 gSaccharose 100 gMais starch 300 gAscorbic acid 3 g is prepared by mixing L,Carnitine, Lecithin and shellac.The mixture is homogenized and pressed, then again milled and sieved to obtain homogeneous particle size.

At the time of his hospitalization the patient was feverish and showed the symptoms of a respiratory insufficiency of medium se ri6usness. The spirometric examination showed a FEZ 9 CV ratio equal to 61, Pco was 39 mmHg, P0 was 89 mmHg. The hematological and hematochemical tests were all normal, except 3 for a slight leukocytosis 8500 mm3 and a moderate increase ofVES. A therapy with theophylline derivatives by intravenous route, amoxycillin and with bronchodilators and secretolytics by inhalation was begun. After 7 days the patient did not show any respitory symptoms but he lamented for a remarkable asthenia, anorexy and sleep disturbances. A treatment with chewable tablets containing 150 mg of L Carnitine and 500 mg of pure soybean Lecithin at the dosage of 6 tablets die tablets of example 3 was begun. The subjective condition of the patient was evaluated by the stress test on a bicycle at lUU W.The exercise was performed every 2 days for the whole period of the treatment, that is 21 days.Starting from the 4th Sth day, an ascending improvement of the subjective symptomatology of the patient as well as an perfonmance in the stress test expressed as an increase of time, from 1.8 minutes during the first day to 8.6 minutes during the 21st day have been observed.These observations show an improvement in the neuromuscular performance caused by the treatment, together with a good compatibility.Case 2A 59 yearold female patient, hospitalized for a condition of severe asthenia after a long period of disease specific pleurisy . Said condition had been lasting for more than two months, in spite of the fact that the patient stayed in bed and was treated with polyvitamins. A treatment with chewable tablets containing 150 mg of L,Carnitine and 500 mg of soybean Lecithin, at the dose of 6 tablets die tablets of example 1 for a period of 30 days was begun.The body weight, the arterial pressure, the muscular strenght by a dynamometer as well as the urinary elimination of the 17ketosteroids were evaluated.The evaluation of the subjective symptoms of asthenia, feelings of weariness, mental tiredness and sleep disturbances was per formed according to a scale of scores. There was observed a remarkable increase of appetite and an improvement of physical and psychic performance, together with an increase of 2.4 kg body weight.The use of dynamometer showed an increase of the muscular strenght of 32 . The treatment was tolerated very well.Case 3A 28 year old male patient.was hospitalized because of a. fracture of the right internal malleolus after a skiing accident. After surgical adjustment and motoric rehabilitation, the subject was treated for 4 weeks witn an association of 150 mg of L Carnitine and 500 mg of soybean Lecithin in the form of chewable tablets at the dose of 10 tablets die tablets of example 3 .The subject was in bed and examined twi a week in order to evaluate his physical performance.For this purpose he was subjected to a sub maximum stress test on an ergometric bicycle.Blood samples were withdrawn for the analyses of lactic acid. At the end of the fourth week the subject s performance in the stress test had increased from 9 minutes to 32 minutes.The examination of lactic acid after the stress test showed a starting value of 10.6 mmol l and a value of 5.9 mmol l after 4 weeks of treatment.No symptoms of intolerance to the therapy have been observed.Case 4A 26 year old male ssogtsman practises cycling at agonistic level since several years.His training is very regular, at present he is in good general health.Since a month he complained about tiredness perhaps in consequence of the mediocre results obtained during the season. He was treated by the pnys cian of the equipe, with chewable tablets containing 150 mg of L,Carnitine and 500 mg of soybeanLecithin tablets of example 2 , at the dosage of 4 tablets every 6 hours for a period of 6 weeks. The subject presented himself regularly for the medical check once a week, his general state of health was evaluated and a sub maxi mum stress test on an ergometic bicycle was performed.Already after two weeks of treatment tne subject did o longer complain about tiredness, he felt in very good form and noted an increase of appetite.The stress test showed an increase of the muscular resistance3 the longest time observed increased from 37 minutes before the treatment to 47 minutes at the 3rd week and to 64 minutes at the 6th week.The subject did not feel any undesirable effect from the treatment.
