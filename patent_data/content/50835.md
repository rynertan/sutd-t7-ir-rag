## Description
This invention relates to a frame suitable for encasing a portion of a wall to form a wall element in which frame C channel section members with two flanges and an interconnecting web are used, the flanges sides being narrower than the web and ending, for the purpose of greater rigidity, with parts turned over by 90 The progress accomplished through the invention in its particular industrial field is considerable as it is possible, thanks to the frames being ready prepared in the factory, to proceed to a rapid, rational and reliable construction at the job site of external walls of a building. They are nowadays any number of manufacturing processes of building parts prefabrication aimed at achieving maximum standardization and therefore economy in the structures. Many of such processes are based on the assembly of modular elements. However, none of them are, to the best of the inventor s knowledge, based on the prior and extensive research work, able to solve all manufacturing problems, whether under the static aspect or under the architectural aspect. US A 3087586 discloses a wall structure in which C channel section members with two flanges and an interconnecting web are used, the flange sides being narrower than the web and ending, for the purpose of greater rigidity with parts turned over by 19 towards the inside of the C channel section in order to stiffen said flanges. However, it should be emphasized that in said wall structure, the upright channels do not face outwards but all face inwards. Thus, a connection of neighbouring wall elements in a groove and key fashion is not possible with and not anticipated by the frames of the wall structures according to said US A 3087586. The frames of the wall structures known therefrom do not have any abutment members, by which the positioning of cladding panels relative to the frame would be possible. Thus, the assembly of walls using the frames or wall structures known from said reference is complicated and precise positioning of panels attached to the frames is not warranted. Furthermore, an adaption of the frame shape to specific requirements of the wall portion to be formed, for instance, to window or door portion, is not possible. The object underlying the present invention is to provide a frame of the above mentioned type, suitable for encasing a portion of an external wall, which avoids the drawbacks known from the state of the art, which is easy to handle, simple in structure and which can be economically manufactured. Said object is solved by the features as claimed in claim 1. The frame in accordance with the invention allows the concrete casting directly into the frame, which by its well defined forms and sizes gives exactly the geometric characteristics of the building element. The frame acts as a form or mold which is then incorporated into the structure. And this unlike the well known prefabrication systems in which the building process of the elements is obtained by means of fixed, complicated heavy and expensive forms. And this unlike also what happens by means of the casting system with detachable reinforcements, where high labour costs for the reinforcements assembly and disassembly must be meeted. Moreover it is also problematic to reach the exact sizes and consequently volumes foreseen. The frames in question are original, first of all, in that they permit as already stated, a portion of any external wall and also partition wall entailing the assembly of two vertical members of C channel section and two horizontal members so as to form a rectangle. Secondly, they are original because the sheet metal members of which they are made have the shorter sides of the C channel section turned towards the outside, except in one of the vertical members where said sides turn towards the inside. Thirdly, they are original because the sheet metal members of which they are made are suitably drilled, that is to say, the wider sides of the C channel section are drilled with holes which permit introduction of any type of filling or insulating material in the portion of the wall encased by the frame. Fourthly they are characteristic because of the provision of Z section reinforcements parallel and close to the sides of the narrower flanges of the vertical members, or else extending from said flanges, serving to determine the positioning and fastening the external cladding panels. Fifthly the frames in question are original because they also permit encasing of portions of external walls through which can extend a pillar when they are provided with suitable rectangular holes on the wider sides of the C channel section of the horizontal members, as well as encasing portions of external walls incorporating a door and balcony provided the lower horizontal frame member be omitted. Sixth characteristic of the invention is that of the provision of cavities in the bottom and or top horizontal members so that they can accommodate the soffit beams and or foundation tracks as they have the three sides of the C channel section equal in length, facing outwards moreover their edges are turned over by 90 towards the outside to permit resting on the ground and supporting of the external cladding panels. These main features and other less important ones concerning the frames according to In such drawings Referring to the figures, each frame T obtainable by the process in accordance with the invention consists of two vertical members L₁, L₂ and two horizontal members L₃, L₄ which, when assembled, form a rectangle. In figures 1b and 1c the letters L₅ and L₆ designate the characteristic Z section reinforcements serving for determining positioning and fastening of the external cladding panels L₇ designates the likewise characteristic element for anchoring frame T to foundation level which is conveniently accommodated in the cavity of member L₄, wherein for such purposes, said member can exceptionally have the three sides of the C channel section equal in length. The different embodiments which can be assumed by member L₇ are clearly visible in figure 6. As stated previously, figures 4, 4a, 4b and 4c illustrate a variation of the frame which can have more than four members such members are designated by L₈ for the vertical member and by L₉ for the horizontal member. L ₈ fig. 4c corresponds to a structural section of special form depending on the overall dimensions of the subframe window for which frame T serves. In figures 5, 5a, 5b and 5c in which yet another embodiment of the frame is illlustrated, there is only one vertical member extra, likewise designated by L₈. Each of the members L₁, L₂, L₃, L₄, L₈, L₉, consists of a C channel section and, as already stated, can be made of sheet metal or glass fibre reinforced plastic. Each of the shorter sides terminates, for the purposes of improved rigidity, with parts turned over by 90 towards the inside of the C channel section in order to stiffen said sides see, for example, figures 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b apart from members L₄ which have said parts turned over by 90 towards the outside of the C channel section in order to support the external cladding panels R. Furthermore all members can be provided with a series of equidistant angle stiffeners I at right angles to the shorter sides of the C channel section, which are spot welded to said sides see fig. 1a . Moreover vertical members L₂, L₅, L₆ are without terminal portions Y at their ends on their wider side and Y on their shorter side, in order to facilitate their welding see fig. 1c . The variations in figures 2b, 3b differ in that they are also provided with rectangular holes f, through which can extend pilasters P, either in addition to or in place of various holes f . Through holes f , it is possible to introduce various materials inside any one of frame T, such as concrete lightweight or otherwise , expanded clay, polyurethane, or any type of filling or insulating material such as glass wool, cork, asbestos cement, polyvinyl chloride or other such materials. Cladding panels R or any type of material can be fastened to the outside of any one of the frames T by means of adhesive, rivetting or other systems. The characteristic Z section reinforcements designated by the letter L₅ and L₆, which were described earlier on , are provided for facilitating this fastening of the cladding panels R. Members L₁, L₃ and L₄ of each frame T have their shorter sides L ₁, L ₃, L ₄ turned to face outwards members L₂, in stead, have sides L ₂ facing towards the inside of the frame hence the various adjacent frames T can be easily joined together so as to build up the external walls of the building see fig.1c . Hence frames T constitute the encasement and at the same time form an irremovable component of said external wall. As frames T are factory produced and are therefore available as ready prepared at the building site, construction of the external walls is very greatly facilitated, being more reliable and rapid with respect to the past. Above all, it should be emphasized that with the process in accordance with the invention, substantially any structural, predimensioning, curtain walling, heat and sound insulation problems can be solved hence the planner s job will be essentially related to aesthetic considerations as it is guaranteed from the economics point of view. With this system, not only can any portion of an external wall be obtained, but it is also possible to obtain internal party wall or partitions, whether they incorporate do not incorporate various service installations. Any one skilled in the art can easily deduce that numerous variations can be effected to the process in accordance with the invention and to the frames obtainable therewith, which are herein described as an exemplification of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention such variations fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the following appended claims.
