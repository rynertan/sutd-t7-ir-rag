# System for efficiently exchanging heat with ground water in an aquifer.

## Abstract
A method and means for using ground water in an aquifer as a heat source and heat sink are disclosed wherein heat is exchanged between the uniform temperature ground water and heat exchanging apparatus at the earth s surface through a signal well bore 2 . The ground water W is exchanged between an upper and lower portion of the aquifer A , alternatively depending on the operating mode, in such a manner that a stratified lateral flow of the water after heat exchange is produced following natural convective paths in the top or bottom of the aquifer and resulting in wide laminar dissipation of the altered temperature water while avoiding thermal mixing between that water and the remaining uniform temperature water in the aquifer. This manner of exchange provides a continuous flow of heating or cooling water at or near the ambient aquifer temperature without any depletion of the aquifer. Embodiments are described wherein the aquifer water is brought to the earth s surface S and wherein a separate heat exchanging fluid is circulated between the aquifer and the earth s surface, and modifications are also disclosed involving a valved plenum device for use with the former embodiments and whereby the aquifer may be used to store solar heat.
