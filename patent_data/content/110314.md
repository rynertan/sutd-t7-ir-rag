# Time division mutiplex data transmission method and system.

## Abstract
A time division multiplex data transmission system. A particular time slot 58 among those for data transmission is placed with alternation of different data modes such as 1 and 0 in a commanding station destined for issuing commands. The alternation of data modes is supplied to receiver stations together with other data. When alternation of data modes is detected at the particular time slot in the receiver station, the reception of one command signal from the commanding station is confirmed, while detection of disappearance of the alternation of data modes indicates other command. Since a fault in the data transmission sys tem results in generation of a fixed data mode or level such as 1 or alternatively 0 , the alternation of data modes and disappearance thereof can define the commands dis criminatively from the state brought about by the fault. Fail safe feature can thus be realized.
