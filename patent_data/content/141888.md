## Description
This invention is in the field of valves and more particularly to the type of valves known as ball valves and is especially suitable for operation at relatively high pressures for example, at 20,000 pounds per square inch.I The valve disclosed herein is designed to withstand extreme pressures and temperatures. Due to the geometry of the valve configuration, it is able to attain a most favorable flow pattern having virtually no pressure drop across the valve due to the cross sectional area of the flowpath therethrough. The structural integrity of the valve is unusually efficient. The body may be thought of as a thick wall shell pressure vessel. The valve body being encased in a collar type ring precisely machined to accept the body and is centrally located about the valve assembly. Due to the compactness of the design, very favorable physical properties of the valve can be obtained. Thus, the valve may be provided with conservative safety factors in a relatively compact design. The valve design disclosed gives a lighter, stronger and less expensive product. The valve disclosure has the following advantages over the block shaped conventional valves. 1. The pressure drop across the valve is minimum since the flow pattern is transmitted in the linear pattern. 2. The material size of the pressure retaining members considerably reduced due to its geometric configuration. 3. The valve body is encased in a centrally positioned collar which retains the turning ball stem. 4. The turning ball stem is so designed that it is nested in a counter bore of the retainer gland, structurally restraining this part from blow out, due to its geometric configuration. 5. The stem retaining gland is proportioned so that the stress level in the external threads are minimized. 6. The mass of the valve is decreased substantially due to its compactness of design. 7. Automatic operation is efficiently accomplished, and manually operated valves can be converted to automatic operation by removing the manual handle and mounting a rotating operator on the valve. When the basic cylindrical body is no longer practieal to withstand the necessary pressure due to adequate wall ratio or physical strength properties of the material, a cylindrical collar is shrunk onto the valve body, thus we now have a multi layer vessel. The advantage of this construction is well known to the state of the art of thick wall pressure design. The theory of the multi layer valve body is as follows The outer shell or collar is machined undersize of the cylindrical body, then the collar is heated to a pre determined temperature expanding the diameters to allow the inner shell of the valve body to be slipped into the collar without use of mechanical force. As the collar cools, the outer diameter of the collar shrinks and exerts a compressive stress at the transition between the outer shell and the inner body.Therefore, internal pressurization of the inner shell or inner body, the induced negative stresses at the transitional wall become zero. This favorable stress condition plus the metal mass surrounding the stem side wall opening results, in a most favorable stress pattern at this area. IN THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of the valve according to the invention. Fig. 2 is an exploded view of some of the valve parts. Fig. 3 is an exploded view of some of the other valve parts. Fig. 4 is an enlarged longitudinal cross section partial view of a part of the valve shown in the other figures. Now with more particular reference to the drawing, the valve 10 has the valve body 11 having a bore 12 through said body 11. The body had a cylindrical outside surface of a precise diameter to receive the collar 19. The body has a counter bore 63 and a second counterbore 67 one at each side of bore 12, and first threaded counterbore 13 forms an inlet and second threaded counterbore 14 forms an outlet from the valve body. The valve may be connected in a flow line within the inlet 13 is connected to one part of the fluid line and the outlet 14 is connected to the other part of the flow line. The lateral opening 15 in the body communicates with the opening 24 in the collar 19. A lateral opening 15 is formed in the body communicating with bore 12. Lateral bore d has first counterbore 38 and second counterbore 39. Ball 16 is received in bore 12 and stem 18 is received in bore 15 as will be explained. The stem 18 has a non circular shaped end 21 that is received in a complimentary shaped hole in the top of the ball valve member 16, and the lower end of stem 65 is received in bore 15. The stem 18 has the enlarged cylindrical part 20 which is received in first counterbore 38 and thrust washer 27 is received on the stem 18 which rests on the upper surface of enlarged cylindrical part 20. The lower end 65 of the stem 18 has a groove that receives the stem seal 27. The stem has a threaded upper end 28 that is received in the hole 29 in handle 30. The threaded end 28 extends through the hole 29, and holds the handle 30 in place and a locknut 31 may lock the handle in place. The collar 19 has an inside cylindrical surface having an inside diameter slightly smaller than the outside diameter of body 11 so that when heated the collar will slip onto body 11 and when cooled collar 19 will shrink onto body 11 and introduce a prestress in the body 11. Collar 19 has a threaded bore 60 which is concentric with bore 15. The stem gland 22 is threadably received in threaded bore 60 in collar 19. The stem 18 extends through the bore 23 in the gland 22, and a stop pin 33 extends through an arcuate slot 34 in the handle thus, the handle may be moved approximately 900 thereby loosening the gland 22 when the pin 33 reaches the end of the arcuate slot 34 and in moving the handle in the opposite direction, the valve opening 35 will move out of alignment with the bores 26. Two plug members 36 are provided and two plug glands 47 are provided. Each plug 47 is threadably received in one of the threaded counterbores 13 and 14. Each plug 47 has a bore 48 which receives the cylindrical end 45 of a plug 36. Plug 36 has a central bore 26 which forms a part of a flow passage, and a headed end 41. The head on the end of each plug 36 is received in one of the counterbores 63 and 64. The plug members 36 each have a convex inner end 37 which the ball seals 17 rest upon, and when pressed into contact with the ball 16 by tightening the plugs 47, the plugs 36 will force the seals 17 into engagement with a convex end 37 of the plug 36 and into engagement with the ball 16. The gland 22 is locked in a proper position by means of the gland nut 56. The pressure chamber in said valve body may be be considered to be the flow passage through the valve between the two plugs 47 that are used for connecting the valve into the fluid line. This is the chamber that the ends I Il of the collar 19 overlie. The plugs 47 reinforce the body outside the pressure chamber.I I il The ball 16 has an axial bore 35 therein which communicates with the bores in each plug 36 and forms with bore 26 in each plug 36 a flow path of uniform cross section. The ball 16 has a non circular opening 40 which receives the end 21 of the turning stem 18. The stem is threaded to its upper most end for fastening either a manual turning handle 30 or a TWE driver for automatic operation of the valve when a rotary operator is used. The spherical elastomer seal 17 is in the form of a ring machined at 60 to fit the ball 16 on the inboard side and the convex end 37 on the outboard side at 61. The ball retaining plugs 36 are designed so that a metal to metal seal is provided at the valve body. The inboard face of the plugs 36 serve as a support surface for the ball seal 17. The outboard end is machined to accept a high pressure eone tubing connector. The part is centrally drilled through for passage of the media through the valve. The plug glands 47 are internally drilled to accept the cylindrical end end 45 of the ball retaining plugs 36. The plug glands 47 are externally threaded to be be received in the threaded inlet and in the threaded outlet end 13 and 14 respectively. The stem seal 27 is commercially available. The seal 17 is best shown in Fig. 5. It will be be seen from an inspection of the drawings that the valve 10 is composed of a body jl 11 with a bore 12 through the body 11 and an inlet opening 13 and an outlet opening 14 It in the body connected to a bore 12. A lateral opening 15 communicates with the bore 12. The valve seals 17 are provided in the body at each side of the lateral opening 1 15. These valve seals 17 as shown are annular members having a spherical sealing Ii surface 60 engaging the outer periphery of the ball 16 and having an end surface 61 engaging the convex end 37 of the plugs 36. The ball is supported between the seal members 17 and may be rotated by the stem 18 which has the non circular member 21 on its lower end and it is received in the non circular opening 40 in the ball. The foregoing specification sets forth the invention in its preferred, practical forms but the structure shown is capable of modification within a range of equivalents without departing from the invention which is to be understood is broadly novel as is commensurate with the appended claims.
