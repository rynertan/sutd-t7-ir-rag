# Air in line detector.

## Abstract
A detector for automatically determining the presence of air in a fluid line comprises a plurality of ON OFF optical sensors selectively disposed in series along the axis of a portion of an I.V. tube according to their relative light sensitivity and according to their dependence upon direct or refracted light for activation. An alarm condition indicates air in line when predetermined individual sensors change their ON or OFF condition in accordance with a microproces sor programmed logic sequence.
