HYDROGENOLYSIS OF POLYALKYLENE GLYCOLS TO PRODUCE MONOETHYLENE GLYCOL MONOALKYL ETHERS, MONOETHYLENE GLYCOL AND ETHANOL Brief Summary of the Invention Technical Field This invention relates to a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, containing at least one ether group therein at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether can be produced in significant amounts by employing the process of this invention. Background Art It is known that monoethylene glycol is commercially produced by the hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which in turn is generated by the oxidation of ethylene, typically by the reaction of ethylene and oxygen over a silver containing catalyst Other processes noncommercial for making monoethylene glycol involve reactions of carbon monoxide with hydrogen or formaldehyde, typically in the presence of a certain precious metal catalyst. Major by products of the commercial oxide glycol process are diethylene glycol and higher polyalkylene glycols in amounts up to 10 percent by weight of the total product mixture. However, diethylene glycol may or may not be a commercially desirable by product.For instance, considerably more diethylene glycol by product may be produced from the commercial oxide glycol process than can be utilized profitably. In those instances where the production of diethylene glycol is commercially undesirable, any process capable of efficiently converting this by product to monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethy0 ether, monoethylene glycol, ethanol or other valuable products would be highly desirable. It has been found as a result of the present invention that polyalkylene glycols, e.g., diethylene glycol, can be selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium to efficiently produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol The following prior art references describe processes involving hydrogenolysis or cleaving with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst Japanese Patent Publication No. 25,246 74 describes selectively cleaving polyalkylene glycols, e.g., diethylene glycol, and polyalkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a nickel or palladium catalyst to give alkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, e.g., monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, polyalkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers, alkylene glycol dialkyl ethers and polyalkylene glycol dialkyl ethers.

However, none of these references and no prior art is currently known to us which discloses or teaches a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.Disclosure of Invention The present invention provides a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g. diethylene glycol, containing at least one ether group therein at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol Monoethytene glycol monoethyl ether can be produced in significant amounts by employing the process of this invention. In copending USSN 307,226 ofSeptember 3Q, 1981, there is described the manufacture of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether can be produced in predominant amounts by employing the process disclosed in this copending application. Copending USSN 307,225 of September 30, 198T describes a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising ruthenium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.The production rate of each of said monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. In copending USSN 307,210 ofSeptember 30, 1981 there is described the manufacture of monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, e.g., copper chromite, to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The selectivity of the monoethylene glycol and ethanol may approach or exceed 95 molar percent using copper chromite as the hydrogenation catalyst. It has been surprisingly found as a result of the present invention that when a composition containing iridium is used as the hydrogenation catalyst in a process for hydrogenolyzing polyalkylene glycols, at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether,1 monoethylene glycol and ethanol is produced in addition to significant amounts of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether. Oetailed Description Hydrogenolysis of polyalkylene glycols may proceed according to different cleavage pathways.for example, as illustrated in the present invention, polyalkylene glycols may be cleaved at either a carbon to oxygen covalent bond or a carbon to carbon covalent bond to give different products. The cleavage pathways are influenced or,, varied, to a certain extent, by choice of hydrogenation catalyst, concentration of active metal in hydrogenation catalyst, pressure provided by molecular hydrogen and other factors.When a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium is used in the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, according to the present invention, the cleavage pathway may be directed toward a carbon to oxygen terminal hydroxy bond resulting in the production of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, a carbon to oxygen ether bond resulting in the production of monoethylene glycol and ethanol, and a carbon to carbon covalent bond resulting in the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether.Because of the high bond energy required to cleave a carbon to oxygen terminal hydroxy bond in comparison with the lower bond energies require d to cleave a carbon to oxygen ether bond and a carbon to carbon covalent bond, it is surprising indeed that monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether may be produced in significant amounts by using a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium in accordance with the hydrogenolysis process of the instant invention. As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is produced in addition to significant amounts of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts which can be used to catalyze the hydrogenolysis process of this invention are well known in the art and include compositions containing iridium. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts may also include.as an additional ingredient, a promoter or promoters for increasing the activity of the hydrogenation catalysts. Suitable catalyst promoters may include barium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, strontium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, potasslum, lithium, sodium, rubidium, cesium, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, zinc and the like Certain metals such as copper, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, iron, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, nickel, rhenium, tantalum, vanadium, niobium, zinc and the like may act as co catalysts in combination with iridium. It is noted that molybdenum, chromium, tungsten and zinc may act as either a co catalyst or promoter.Reference to the hydrogenation catalysts, promoters and co catalysts as containing the above described metals is meant to include the metal in the compound form as well as the elemental form, for example as a metal oxide or sulfide or as a metal hydride, or as the reduced elemental metal or as mixtures of the foregoing.The hydrogenation catalysts may be employed in the presence or absence of a catalyst support Suitable catalyst supports include silica gel, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide, magnesium aluminate, zirconium dioxide, silicon carbide, ceramic, pumice, carbon, diatomaceous earth, kieselguhr and the like. Illustrative of the preferred hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention include compositions containing iridium on a suitable catalyst support, e.g., iridium on silica gel, iridium on kieselguhr and the like. The compositions containing oxides may be totally or partially reduced in situ during reactor heat up. The most preferred hydrogenation catalysts of this invention include compositions containing at least about 5 percent by weight iridium on a suitable catalyst support, and are prepared by known methods detailed hereinbelow. The hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention can be employed in any form. They may be present in the reaction mixture as finely divided powders, porous tablets, pellets, spheres, granules and the like. It is desirable that the hydrogenation catalysts possess a high surface area. Thetpreferred surface area ranges from about O.5 m2 gm to about 300 m2 gm and even greater. Most preferably, the surface area of the hydrogenation catalysts ranges from about 10 m2 gm to about 300 m2 gm. The average pore diameter of the hydrogenation catalysts is not narrowly critical. Hydrogen diffusion appears to be rate limiting in catalysts having very small pores. It appears that a very small average pore diameter and or a Targe catalysts particle diameter are detrimental to high monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanol selectivities and or polyalkylene glycol conversion rates. In general, for obtaining desirable monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether monoethylene glycol monomethyl ethermonoethylene glycol ethanol selectivities, it is believed that catalysts hav1t an average pore diameter of at least about 50 , preferably at least about 250 A, and a particle diameter of less than 10 millimeters, preferably 5 millimeters or even less, are useful in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention. The quantity of the hydrogenation catalysts which is employed is not narrowly critical and can vary over a wide range. In general, the process of this invention is desirably conducted either continuously or batchwfse in the presence of a catalytically effective quantity of the hydrogenation catalysts which gives a suitable and reasonable reaction rate, e.g., from about 1 to about 100 moles kilogram catalyst hour. The reaction proceeds when one employs as little as about0.Ol weight percent, or even a lesser amount of catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture under batch conditions. The upper concentration of the hydrogenation catalyst can be quite high, e.g.,. about 50 weight percent of catalyst based on the total quantity of reaction mixture. Higher concentrations may be used if desired.However, the upper concentration appears to be dictated by economics in terms of the cost of certain hydrogenation catalysts to achieve the given reaction and by ease of handling of the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction.Depending on various factors, such as the total operative pressure of the system, the operative temperature and other considerations, a concentration of between about 0.1 and about 30 weight percent hydrogenation catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture is generally suitable in the practice of this invention. The preferred polyalkylene glycols which can be used in the practice of the process of thisInvention are well known in the art and include diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and the likes In the most preferred embodiment of this invention, diethylene glycol formed as a by product of the commercial oxide glycol process described hereinabove, is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence. of a hydrogenation catalyst containing iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanolBy utilizing the preferred catalysts and reaction conditions of the present invention, higher polyalkylene glycols such as triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol may be selectively cleaved to give at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol These polyalkylene glycols are prepared by methods well known in the art The relative amounts of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen which are initially present in the reaction mixture c an be varied over a wide range In general, the molar ratio of molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol is in the range of between about 1 20 and about 2000 1, preferably between about 1 2 and about 500 1 and most preferably, between 1 1 and about 200 1. It is to be understood however, that molar ratios outside the stated broad range may be employed. However, very high molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol molar ratios are economically unattractive, and very low molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol molar ratios will result generally in low conversions and lower product selectivities. When operating in the continuous mode, molecular hydrogen and polyalkylene glycol may be fed either concurrently or countercurrently over the hydrogenation catalyst using either upward, downward or horizontal flow with concurrent downward flow being preferred.The gas hourly space velocity GHSV of molecular hydrogen and the liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of polyalkylene glycol may be varied over a wide range utilizing the continuous process. The gas hourly space velocity of molecular hydrogen may range from about 100 nr 1 or less to greater than 100,000 hr 1, preferably from about 1,000 hr 1 to about lQO,OOO hr 1, and most preferably from about 2,000 hr 1 to about 5,000 hr 1.The liquid hourly space velocity of polyalkylene glycol may range from about .01 hr 1 ar less to about 100 hr 1 or greater, preferably from about 0.1 hr 1 to about 25 hr 1, and most preferably from about 0.25 hr 1 to about 10 hr 1. The higher GHSV and LH values generally tend to result in uneconomtcally low conversion of polyalkylene glycol, and the lower GHSV and LHSV values generally tend to decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.The intended purpose is to provide a sufficient quantity of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen in the reaction mixture to effect the desired production of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The process of this invention can be effected over a wide temperature range In general, the process is conducted at a temperature of between about 15O0C and about 3500C. Lower temperatures generally give improved product selectivity, but often at economically unfavorable rates. Higher temperatures generally increase total productivity but tend to increase by product formation.Operating the process at temperatures lower than 1500C will not produce the desired products at optimum rate so that the reaction will typically be operated over an extended period of time and or excessive quantities of catalyst must be employed in order to obtain the desired production of reaction products at reasonable rates. When operating the process at temperatures higher than 3500C there is a tendency for the organic materials contained in the reaction mixture to decompose. In most cases when operating at the lower end of the temperature range, it is desirable to utilize pressures in the higher end of the pressure range. The preferred temperature range is between about 2000C and 3000C, while the most preferred temperature range is between about.2250C and 265 C. However, there are occasions when a preferred temperature range may include any of the more desirable ranges as well as the broadest range such that the process may be operated at a temperature of between 175 C and 3000C as well as between about 150 C and 3250C. The process of the present invention is effected under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure conditions. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pressure is produced almost exclusively by the molecular hydrogen provided to the reaction. However, suitable inert gaseous diluents may also be employed if desired.Actuat operating pressures initial pressures under batch operating condit ion of between about atmospheric and about 10,000 psig represent an operative limit for producing the monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol products. The preferred actual operating pressure conditions for the production of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol range from about µts Psrg to about 4000 psig and, most bar preferably, from about 05 pslg to about i 0 psig. When operating the process at lower pressures, the rate of reaction becomes slower and therefore the reaction period must be extended until the desired amount of reaction products are produced. When operating the process at higher pressures, the rate of production of the desired products will generally be increased. Higher pressures generally tend to increase the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol but very high pressures can also increase by product formation through secondary hydrogenolysis reactions. Lower pressures generally tend to increase the formation of by products such as 2 oxodioxane and decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The process of this invention is effected for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol products. In general, the reaction time can vary from a fraction of a second ta several hours, i.e., from 0.1 second and shorter to approximately 10 hours,.and longer. If more sluggish reaction conditions are selected, then the reaction time will have to be extended until the desired products are produced It is readily appreciated that the required res idence period, i.e., reaction time, will be influenced.by reaction temperature, concentration and choice of hydrogenation catalyst, total pressure, concentration molar ratio of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen and other factors.When operating the hydrogenolysis process of this invention under continuous conditions, the reaction time or residence period may generally range from a fraction of a second to several minutes or more whereas the residence period under batch conditions may generally range from a few minutes to several hours. The synthesis of the desired products from the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol is suitably conducted under operative conditions which give reasonable reaction rates and or conversions. The process of this invention can be carried out in a batch, semi continuous or continuous manner in either a liquid phase, vapor phase or a combination liquid vapor phase. The reaction may be conducted in fixed bed, slurry phase, trickle bed or fluidized bed reactors or the like using a single reaction zone or in a plurality of reaction zones, in series or in parallel. The reaction may be conducted intermittently or continuously in an elongated tubular zone or a series of such zones. The material of construction of the equipment should be such so as to be inert during the reaction.The equipment should also be able to withstand the reaction temperatures and pressures The reaction zone can be fitted with internal and or external heat exchangers to control undue temperature fluctuations caused by the moderate exothermic nature of the reaction. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, agitation means to ensure complete mixing of the reaction mixture should be used in reaction systems not employing a fixed bed catalyst. Mixing induced by magnetic stirrer, vibration, shaker, rotating, sparging with gas, oscillation, etc. are all illustrative of the types of agitation means which are contemplated herein.Such agitation means are available and well known to the art. The polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be initially introduced into the reaction zone batchwise. Alternatively the polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be introduced into the reaction zone continuously or intermittently during the course of the synthesis reaction. Means to introduce the ingredients into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction and or means to adjust the ingredients in the reaction zone during the reaction, either intermittently or continuously, can be conveniently utilized in the process to maintain the desired molar ratios of ingredients and to maintain the pressure exerted by hydrogen. The operative conditions of the present process may be adjusted to optimize the selectivities and conversion rates of the desired products and or the economics of the process. For example, It may generally be preferred to operate at relatively tow conversion rates, which tends to increase selectivities of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol due to reduced by product formation. Lower conversions also tend to increase the monoethylene glycol ethanol molar ratio by reducing secondary hydrogenolysis of monoethylene glycol. Recovery of the desired monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol can be achieved by methods well known in the art, such as by distillation, fractionation, extraction, and the like. Typically, in carrying out the process, the product contained in the reaction mixture would be withdrawn from the reaction zone and distilled to recover the desired products For reactors not employing a fixed bed catalyst, a fraction comprising the hydrogenation catalyst and hy produc ts can be removed for recovery or regeneration of the catalyst. Fresh hydrogenation catalyst can be intermittently added to the reaction stream or it can be added directly to the reaction zone, to replenish any catalyst which is lost in the process.
