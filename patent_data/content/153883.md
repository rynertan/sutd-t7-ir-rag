# APPARATUS FOR GAS ANALYSIS

## Abstract
A breath alcohol testing instrument comprises a brea thing tube 10 connected to an instrument 15 for detecting alcohol, including a sampling system comprising a spring loaded piston 30 arranged to draw a gas sample into a sampling chamber 21 in contact with an electro chemical fuel cell 20 . A pressure sensor 52 detects a predetermined breath flow rate and starts a timer 53 which after a predetermined interval actuates a solenoid 40 to release the sampler. If the suspect interrupts normal breath flow the system does not abort . The solenoid 40 is still actuated automatically either immediately when the pressure sensor 52 indicates a predetermined drop in pressure or after the preselected time interval. Simultaneously a test fail signal is generated 55 and applied to a warning signal generator 56 which actuates a visible or audible warning sign to indicate a non standard test result.
