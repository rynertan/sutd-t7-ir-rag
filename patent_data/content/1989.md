It is well known in the art that the mercapto group is subject to reaction with aldehydes and ketones to form hemimercaptals and hemimercattoles. It is similarly known in the art, Field et al., J. Med. Chem. 12, 624 628 1969 that many of these hemimercaptals and hemimercaptoles prepared from biologically active mercaptans serve as latentiating derivatives, or as chemical modifications of biologically active compounds to form new compounds, which upon in vivo enzymatic or chemical transformation will liberate the parent compounds. Latentiation may also provide means of favorably influencing absorption, transport, distribution, localization, metabolism, toxicity, and duration of action, as well as stability.Included with the group of aldehydes and ketones suitable for this purpose are chloral, hexafluoro acetone, acetone, benzaldehyde, pyruvate, and ketomalonate. Since latentiation of mercapto groups by this means is known in the art, these latentiating derivatives are considered to be within the spirit scope of the novel method of treatment and novel compounds of this invention. Another means of latentiation is by addition of the thiols of this invention to a,p unsaturated acids such as maleic acid and cinnamic acid as described by Srivistava et al., in J. Med. Chem., 16, 428 429 1973 . Latentiation may also be achieved by substitution of the mercapto hydrogen with a l methyl 4 nitroimidazol5 yl group as in azathioprine or a pivaloyloxymethyl group. Presenting, levamisole, s 2,3,5,6 tetrahydro 6 phenylimidazo 2,1 b thiazole hydrochloride, is one of the few immunoregulants, or immunepotentiators, in the clinical literature. The clinical efficacy of levamisole in correcting an imbalance of immune homeostasis, and thus its effectiveness in treatment of a number of diseases and disorders characterized or complicated by an imbalance of immune homeostasis, has been confirmed by well controlled multi center clinical studies in several diseases and disorders. Consequently, compounds possessing therapeutic properties similar to or better than levamisole would be a valuable contribution to medicine in the field of immunology, and other fields as well. Accordingly, it is an important discovery that the substituted mercapto acid amides of the present invention possess immunological properties similar but superior to those of levamisole, and that they are thus of value in correcting an imbalance of immune homeostasis and for treatment of a number of diseases and disorders characterized or complicated by such an imbalance of immune homeostasis. Among the diseases and conditions which are characterized or complicated by an imbalance of immune homeostasis are a variety of recurrent and chronic infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. A variety of viral, bacterial, fungal and protozoal infections may be subject to treatment. The improvement of the potential of certain vaccines and the prevention of viral immunosuppression may also result. A number of primary immune deficiency or autoimmune diseases may be treated, and allergic disorders such as bronchial asthma may be improved.Various rheumatic diseases, including especially rheumatoid arthritis, may be treated. Certain neurologic disorders and gastrointestinal disorders where an imbalance of immune homeostasis plays a role may be improved by treatment. The treatment of some oncologic diseases may be augmented.Particularly, restoration of immune homeostasis following cytostatic treatment or radiotherapy may be improved. For use in correcting an imbalance of immune homeostasis and treatment of diseases or disorders characterized or complicated thereby, the compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal, intraarticular, injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warmblooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the present invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch, or alginic acid binding agents, for example starch, gelatine or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia dis per sing or wetting agents may be a naturally occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.The said aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n propyl, p hydroxy benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, ay also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in the form of oil in water emulsions. The oil phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oils, or in a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gun tragacanth, naturally occuring phosphatides, for example soya bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono oleate. the emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water,Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. Dosage levels of the order of 0.1 mg. to 140 mg.per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions 25 mg. to 7 gms. per patient per day . For example, correction of an imbalance of immunehomeostasis may be accomplished by the administration of about 0.5 to 50 mg. of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day 5 mg. to 3.5 gms.per patient per day . Advantageously, from about 1 mg.to about 15 mg. per kilogram of body weight per daily dosage produces highly effective results 50 mg. to 1 gm. per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 5 mg. to 5 gm. of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 25 mg. to about 500 mg. of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease or disorder undergoing therapy.
