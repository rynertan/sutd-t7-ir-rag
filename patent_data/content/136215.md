# METHOD AND MATERIALS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF IMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES PROTECTIVE AGAINST MALARIAL INFECTION

## Abstract
Disclosed are vaccine compositions for use in developing protective immunity against infection by Plasmodium para sites. Soluble proteinaceous immunogens are isolated from the fluid culture medium of in vitro propagated plasmodial species parasites e.g., P.falciparum in mammalian erythrocyte cul ture supernatant or from washes, including hypotonic washes, of cultured erythrocytes parasitized by plasmodium. Immuno gens so obtained have molecular weights in the range from about 35,000 daltons to about 85,000 daltons. Two principal immunogens of the invention have molecular weights of about 42,000 and 54,000 daltons, respectively. The water soluble immunogens are administered in a suitable carrier such as iso tonic salt solution and in combination with a suitable adjuvant such as saponin or, preferably, aluminum hydroxide. Upon ad ministration to vertebrate animals susceptible to plasmodial in fection, vaccines according to the invention provoke immune responses protective against morbidity and mortality caused by, e.g., P.falciparum infection. Disclosed also are procedures for optimization of large scale plasmodial parasite growth in human erythrocyte cultures with accompanying development of late erythrocytic stage parasites in large numbers and opti mization of isolatable quantities of culture medium supernatant and wash derived immunogens.
