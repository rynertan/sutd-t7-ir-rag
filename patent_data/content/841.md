# Improvements in or relating to friction materials.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a composition for a friction material, eg a brake pad, of the type which consists of a fibrous reinforcement, a binder, and various additives. The friction material contains no asbestos but has properties comparable with asbestos based materials. The composition contains a thermoset binder which includes a phenol formaldehyde resin, although it may also contain a heat and chemical resistant rubber. The binder makes up 20 to 45 per cent by volume of the material. As sole fibrous reinforcement 5 to 15 by volume of steel fibre is used, and the material also contains at least 10 by volume of an inert mineral filler eg barytes, whiting, silica.
