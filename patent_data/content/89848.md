# Proportional width printing system.

## Abstract
A proportional width printing system is provided with tab means enabling it to print in columns. Characters in an output line buffer 72 are supplied to a character generator address register 74 which addresses the character generator memory to provide character gener ating signals to the printer. When each character has been generated an end of character detector 82 initiates the generation of the next succeeding character in the line. To enable the printer to print in columns a tab memory 88 stores the address of the left margin of each column and is addressed by a tab memory address counter 86 synchro nised with the printer scan. A tab bit indicating the first character of a column generates a tab signal in the character generator address register 74 which prevents the end of character detector 82 initiating the generation of the next character and stops the incrementing of the character generator address register until the tab memory 88 indi cates that the beginning of a column has been reached. The character generator address register 84 may generate a signal identifying the required tab position, and this may be compared with a corresponding signal stored in the tab memory 88 by a comparator 90 to provide the signal for initiating the generation of a character.
