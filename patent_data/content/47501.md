# Multiterminal DC power transmission system.

## Abstract
Control units 41, 42, 44, 45 are provided asso ciative with forward and inverse converters 15, 16, and 28, 29 in a multiterminal DC power transmission system, respectively. The control units 41, 42, and 44, 45 set different constant voltages Edp1 to Edp4 in the converters 15, 16, 28, 29 . Further, the minimum value Edp1 of the constant voltage set values in the forward converters 15, 16 is set at a value larger than the maximum value of the constant voltage set values in the inverse converters 28, 29 .
