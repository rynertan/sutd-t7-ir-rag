# Foamed plastics laminates.

## Abstract
Laminated foamed plastics articles, especially polyurethane and polyisocyanurate rigid foam panels, are faced with a composite layer of vermiculite lamellae and metal foil, especially aluminium foil. The vermiculite lamel lae are preferably size graded to below 50 microns and form a coating on the metal foil which has a thickness preferably below 50 microns. The laminated articles have good fire resistance properties.
