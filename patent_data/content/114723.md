## Description
This invention relates to a slip or document issuing apparatus in which the forms of slips or documents and data to be entered thereon are read and stored, the relevant data are edited electronically, and slips or documents with the proper form and information are printed out. In the processing of delivery slips for gift sales in a department store, a written order for a gift is prepared when a customer has requested the department store to deliver a gift to another person. The written order is used for producing a delivery slip. The delivery slip is used during the period that the ordered item or gift is selected, wrapped, and delivered to a delivery station together with a delivery memorandum. The gift is delivered to the destination from the delivery station and receipt of the gift is acknowledged by a signature. The signed receipt is returned to the store to complete billing and record keeping procedures. Different department stores employ different types of delivery slips, however, in general each set of delivery slips commonly includes the following individual slips Information in the written order for the gifts, such as the name and address of the customer, the name and address of each person to receive an ordered item or gift, and the number of ordered items or gifts, are entered, as common data, on each individual slip. The slips relating to the same order are then forwarded, as one set of slips, to the delivery, gift, or similar department responsible for fulfilling the customer s request. It is essential that the individual slips in a set be arranged in the proper order so that they can be removed as various steps in the delivery process are completed. Heretofore, the above described slips have been prepared according to 1 a spirit system, 2 a copy system or an overlay system , and 3 a hand written system. According to these systems, a set of delivery slips is prepared by transferring or copying necessary data on preprinted sheets from the written order. However, since a busy department store prepares a large number of different delivery slips to fulfill many gift orders, the slips often become mixed up and out of order or are incorrectly issued in duplicate. Accordingly, much time and labor must be devoted to checking the delivery slips causing the conventional procedure to be uneconomical and inefficient. Although various means have already been proposed in other applications eg. US A 3828319 to read data from forms and to insert read image data into these forms for various purposes, it is important in the present application to check that the output forms are in the correct order and it is an object of the present invention to provide a document issuing apparatus which incorporates a checking arrangement. According to the invention there is provided a document issuing apparatus comprising means for separately reading image data and form data from documents, means for storing such image data and form data, means for combining and editing said stored data to produce a series of slip images, and means for reproducing said slip images as visible images on respective printed documents, characterized by means for automatically reading identifying marks on each of said printed documents, such marks being printed thereon in accordance with said printed slip images such that, based on these marks each printed slip image can be identified so as to enable verification of the order in which the documents have been printed. The present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art when considered in the light of the accompanying drawings, wherein Figures 1 a and 1 b are examples of a blank form with identifying indicia and an order form, respectively. Figures 2 a through 2 d are examples of delivery slips. Figure 3 is a block diagram of a document issuing apparatus according to the present invention. Figure 1 a shows one example of one set of delivery slip blank forms which is used in department stores or the like, as was described above. Figure 1 b shows one example of a gift purchasing application on which data have been entered according to a gift order. Elements 1a 1d of Figure 1 a , comprise four documents or the slips which form a set of written delivery slips. As is apparent from Figure 1 a and Figures 2 a 2 d , digital marks representing form numbers or slip numbers are printed on the upper right corners of the delivery slip blank forms 1 of the delivery slips 3 which have been provided according to a gift purchasing application form 2. For instance, marks 3e reprenting numerals 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are printed on the top of the first slip 3a, the second slip 3b, the third slip 3c, and the fourth slip 3d, respectively. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of document issuing apparatus of the present invention. The document issuing apparatus comprises means for reading image data and form data from documents. As embodied herein, the reading means comprises a reading section 6 including a photoelectric conversion element and a mechanism including an illuminating device, a lens, and an electronic circuit. As apparent to one skilled in the art, a document placed on a platen not shown is illuminated by the illuminating device and an image of the document is focused on the photoelectric conversion element by means of the lens. The electronic circuit is connected to the output of the photoelectric conversion element such that the visual image is transformed into corresponding electronic signals. If the image on the document placed on the platen is one of the blank delivery slips 1a 1d shown in Figure 1 a , then an electronic image of the particular form is generated. Similarly, if the document placed on the platen is the gift purchasing application or order document 2, then electronic signals representing the destination, gift identification, unit price, code, etc. are generated. Memory means are provided for storing the image data gift purchasing application and the form data delivery slips read by the reading means. As embodied herein, the memory means comprises a memory section 8, e.g., an integrated circuit memory chip or a small disc drive, capable of storing the image data and form data in a retrievable manner. Means are provided for editing the image data and the form data stored in the memory means to produce a series of slip images. As embodied herein, the editing means comprises an operating panel 4 and a control section 5. An operator enters slip processing information through the operating panel 4. The control section 5, which is advantageously embodied as a microprocessor, receives the control information and accesses the memory section 8 to selectively retrieve the stored image data and form data. One with ordinary skill in the art would readily understand that the control section 5 operates under program control to select the appropriate form data and image data for combination such that a complete, electronic, slip image is generated. The control section 5 operates under such program control until electronic slip images of the delivery slips of Figures 2 a through 2 d are produced. Means for printing the slip images on respective documents is also provided. As embodied herein, the printing means comprises an output section7, i.e., an ink jet or other suitable printer, for forming visible reproductions of the electronic slip images. The output section also prints on the slip the digital markings identifying the type of each slip. Means are also provided for examining the documents printed with the slip images to verify the order in which the documents have been printed. As embodied herein, the output checking system comprises an output check section 9 for checking the digital marks or code printed on the documents and for automatically indicating an uncoded or incorrectly coded document. One skilled in the art would readily understand that the output check section 9 includes a device for verifying the sequence of the printed slips in accordance with the digital marks or code. Such a device could be implemented by a photoelectric scanner and a simple sequence checker circuit. In order to provide the set of written delivery slips as shown in Figure 2 a according to the gift purchasing written application 3 as shown in Figure 1 b , the delivery slip blank form 1a, as shown in Figure 1 a , is placed on the platen. Next, the operating panel is operated to provide a start instruction signal so that the reading section 6 reads the delivery slip blank form 1a by optical scanning to produce digital signals corresponding to the electronic image of the blank delivery form. The digital signals thus provided are stored in the memory section 8 under the control of the control section 5. Similarly, the reading section 6 reads the delivery slip blank forms 1 b , 1 c , and 1 d , and the digital signals thereof are stored in the memory section 8. The images 1a , 1b , 1c , and 1d of the four delivery slip blank forms thus stored are read out of the memory section 8 whenever a delivery slip is issued thereafter. The gift purchasing application 2 is then placed on the platen and a delivery slip issuing start button not shown on the operating panel 4 is depressed. As in the case of inputting the data of the blank delivery slips 1, the gift purchasing application 2 is scanned and the output signals are stored in the memory section 8 as an electronic image of the gift purchasing application 2. Next, the necessary image data of the image 2 of the gift purchasing application, including the data 2b representing a requesting person, are read out of the memory section 8 under the control of the control section 5. The positions of the data 2a and 2b are based on a coordinate system. Therefore, these data 2a and 2b can be readily identified and addressed by specifying their respective coordinates. The data 2a and 2b and the form data of the electronic images 1a , 1b , 1c , and 1d of the blank delivery slips, which have been stored before, are then electronically combined and edited, and may be restored in the memory section 8. That is, slip image of one set of delivery slips four kinds of delivery slips are stored in the memory section 8. The slip images are then printed by the output section 7 and each printed slip image includes a digital mark or code identifying the type of slip image. In the final step, the output checking section 9 checks the order of printed slips. As was described before, the slips 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d have the digital marks representing the numerals 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively, and are outputted in the stated order. The output checking section 9 has a sensor comprising, for instance, a light source and a photocell, which is arranged at a position through which the digital mark on each slip passes, in order to check whether or not the slips pass through the sensor in the stated order. This also permits a determination to be made as to whether or not other slips are improperly mixed in and whether or not the slips have passed through the sensor within a predetermined period of time. If not, the sensor operates to stop the apparatus and to allow the operator to take necessary measures to correct the problem. As is apparent from the above description, according to the invention, the delivery slips thus produced are arranged in order and are prepared correctly and quickly. Accordingly, the number of steps required for after management can be considerably reduced. In the above described embodiment, the electronic forms are stored, and printed out. Therefore, preprinting is unnecessary, and it is also unnecessary to feed stock sheets in a particular order. While the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment, it should be noted that the invention is not limited thereto or thereby that is, it may be modified as follows While the invention has been described with reference to the preparation of delivering slips, it goes without saying that the technical concept of the invention is applicable to slip or document preparing devices in which the slips or documents are to be checked as described above. While the salient features of the invention have been described with reference to the drawings, it should be understood that the preferred embodiment described herein is susceptible of the above modifications and alterations, as well as others, without departing from the scope of the following claims.
