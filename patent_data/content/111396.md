# Programmable trigger coupling circuit.

## Abstract
A programmable trigger coupling circuit and trigger circuit for selecting DC and AC coupling modes in addition to a few other coupling modes without using a DC blocking capacitor in series with the signal path having an input terminal 42 , a differential amplifer 46 , a filter combination 48, 50 and a switch 52 . A short high frequency signal path, low pass filter network and a subtraction circuit are used for obtaining the basic trigger coupling modes. Additional circuits may be used for expanded coupling modes and functions.
