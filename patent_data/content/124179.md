## Description
PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT TO MANUFACTURE A CIGARETTE FILTERThe invention relates to a process and an equipment to manufacture a cigarette filter, which filter comprises a rod of cellulose acetate or other suitable filter rod material surrounded by an air impervious layer such as a filter wrap material and by a tipping wrapper which is entirely or partly perforated or porous, a layer of an open structure material being applied between the air impervious layer and the tipping wrapper, from which open structure layer one end to be connected with the tobacco column of a cigarette is closed.A filter of the above described type is known from Dutch patent applications 8201808 and 8202896 of applicant, which patent applications have been laid open to public inspection.It appeared that in practice itris hard to manufacture and process the known filters at a hight production rate.The aim of the invention is to improve this and to provide a process and equipment belonging thereto, which enable the manufacture of a cigarette filter of the above mentioned type at a high production rate and at relatively low costs.According to the invention this has been achieved in that a continuous strip of tipping wrapper is passed through a perforation device, along a filling means supply unit and is engaged preliminary in view of a seam sticking nozzle with a plurality of threads provided continuously with an adhesive layer, the threads sinking into the filling means layer applied by the filling means supply unit, which assembly of perforated tipping wrapper and threads is filled by a size strip and a strand former with a rod of cellulose acetate or other suitable filter rod material which rod is surrounded by an air impervious layer, which strand can be cut to filter rods by a strand cutter.Preferably the driving of the size strip is connected to the driving of the perforation device by a variable transmission.The transmission ratio of the variable transmission can be determined by a control unit to which an input signal is fed which is dependent on the length of the path of the tipping wrapper between the perforation device and the strand cutter, and an input signal which provides information about the number of revolutions of the perforation device.Preferably the output signal of the control unit is a frequency modulated signal.An equipment for bringing into practice the above described processes for instance comprises an opposite rotating perforating roller having pins extending in axial and radial direction, and capstan roller having radially and axially extending receiving cavities, a filling means supply unit applying next to each perforation a layer of filling means which has to assure the sealing between the layer of open structure material at the end of the tobacco column, a sticking unit at least partly coating the jackets of a pluarlity of adjacent threads with an adhesive layer preliminary to engaging the tipping wrapper, a seam sticking nozzle applying an adhesive layer along one of the edges of the tipping wrapper, strings driven by driving rollers on which filter rod material is supplied to the assembly of the tipping wrapper and the threads, a strand former in which the assembly of tipping wrapper, threads and filter rod material is formed by a size strip to a strand, and an electronic control unit adjusting a transmission between the capstan roller of the perforation device and the size strip of the strand former, driven by a size strip drum.Preferably the electronic control unit receives a first input signal from a tacho generator, which first input signal is a reference for the number of revolutions of the capstan roller, and a second input signal of a scanning arm, which second input signal is a reference for the length of the path of the tipping wrapper between the perforation device and the strand cutter, whereas the electronic control unit processes the input signals and converts them into a frequency modulated output signal which adjusts the number of revolutions of a step motor of a satellite carrier of a epicyclic driving of the size strip drum belonging to the transmission.The filling means supply unit can be provided with an adhesive roller having slits.The invention will be elucidated further hereunder with reference to the drawing, in which by way of example a cigarette filter and an equipment for bringing into practice the process for manufacturing said filter are indicated. In the drawing Figure 1 shows a filter strand in perspective during coating in the strand former, figure 2 shows a tobacco column and a filter in perspective, the tipping wrapper being somewhat unwinded, and figure 3 shows a schematical view of an equipment to bring the invention into practice.In figure 1 a filter strand 1 is shown on a somewhat larger scale than in practice, the filter strand comprising a rod 2 of cellulose acetate or other suitable filter rod material surrounded by an air impervious layer 3, such as filter wrapping material.Threads 4 of a textile or synthetic filament having a diameter of about 0.1 mm or more, which threads are extendirg in longitudinal direction with respect to the filter, are winded thereabout. These threads 4 can be considered as a layer of the open structure material. Said threads are sticked to a tipping wrapper 6 beforehand, which tipping wrapper is provided with perforations. The perforation have an axial distance a and two filling means layers 7 are positioned between every other perforation row.In figure 2 a filter cigarette 8 is shown, on a somewhat larger scale than in figure 1, from which it appears that one filling means layer 7 of figure 1 forms the sealing of the open structure layer at the location of the connection to a tobacco column 9 which is surrounded by normal cigarette wrapper 10.The equipment for bringing the invented process into practice, shown in figure 3, comprises a supply unit, for instance a paper bobine for a continuous strip 6 of tipping wrapper, supplied to a perforation device 14 by a guiding means 12 and a guiding roll 13The perforation device 14 comprises a perforating roller 15 and a capstan roller 16. The perforating roller 15 has needles or punching pins 17 and the capstan roller 16 has receiving cavities 18 which can receive the needles or pins 17 during opposite rotation of the rollers 15 and 16. Besides suction holes not shown are provided as well to suck the tipping wrapper in tight fit to the roller 16 by subatmospheric pressure, so that no slip can occur.The pins 17 and the receiving cavities 18 both have an angle distance causing the distance a between the perforations 5 figure 1 .At the lower side of the perforation device 14 an elevating roller 20 is provided with its opposite end on the pivotable end of an arm 19, which elevating roller guides the tipping wrapper to a filling means supply unit 21, comprising a store container 22 for liquid or paste like filling means, in which a roll 23 having axial slots, rotates, transferring the filling means 24 to a adhesive roller 25. The radial distance between the slots is alternatingly small and large, so that the desired succession of filling means layers 7 with respect to the perforations 5 is obtained. The pressurized air cylinder 26 and the tumbler lever 27 serve to remove the store container 22 and clean it and also to press the roll 23 and the roller 25 against each other with the correct pressure. The filling means can be a PVA adhesive poly vinyl acetate adhesive .Beside the filling means supply unit 21 anadhesive unit 28 is provided comprising a adhesive container 29 in which an adhesive roll 30 is rotating. The adhesive roll 30 transfers adhesive to radial slots in the jacket of an adhesive roller along which the threads 4 pass before being pressed with their glued sides to the tipping wrapper 6 and in the filling means layers 7 when passing a guiding means 12. The adhesive unit 28 is provided with a pressurized air cylinder 26 and a tumbler lever 27, just as in the filling means supply unit 21 and they have the same function as in the latter.The threads 4 emerge from a thread supply unit 32 in which a plurality of thread spools 33 are positioned with threads of textile or synthetic filaments having a diameter of about 0.1 mm or more Between the thread supply unit 32 and the unit 28 the threads are extending over an elevating roll 35 applied to the pivotable end of an arm 34 and after that the tipping wrapper 6 and the threads 4 move together substantially vertically upwards along a seam sticking nozzle 36, a possible drying device not shown , a guiding shoe 38 positioned at the pivotable end of a scanning arm 37 towards a horizontal upper portion of a size strip 39, which forms part of the so called strand former 40.The seam sticking nozzle 36 provides a adhesive layer along one of the edges of the tipping wrapper so that it can be overlappingly sealed in the strand former 40. This adhesive layer can exist of a hot melt .Between the guiding shoe 38 and the strand former 40,the tipping wrapper 6 and the threads 4 are extending below narrowly spaced strings 41 of a rod supply unit 42. The strings 41 are guided over a driving roll 43 and a plurality of small guiding rolls 44. The rod supply unit 42 further comprises a hopper 45 with a stock of filter rods surrounded by filter wrapping material 3 with a length of two, four or six future cigarette filters, which are transferred to a filter mill 47 by rotating transferring drums 46, which filter mill places the filter rods on the strings 41. But it is also possible to continuously supply a filter strand surrounded by filter wrapping material in the direction of movement of the upper portions of the strings 41 of the rod supply unit 42.The strand former 40 is a device with a flat plate 48, changing into a circular shaped tube, so that the assembly of size strip 39, tipping wrapper 6 with threads 4 and a rod 2 surrounded by an air impervious layer 3, changes its shape from the left to the right in figure 1.The upper portion of the size strip 39 is extending between guiding rolls 49 and is driven by a so called size strip drum 50. One should imagine the situation in which the cutting device 51 and the capstan roller 16 are connected to each other by a predetermined transfer ratio and in which the size strip drum 50 with a variable transfer ratio is connected to the cutting device 51 and the capstan roller 16.As the size strip 39 and the outer periphery of the size strip drum are both subject to wear the transport rate of the strand in the strand former will not be in absolutely fixed relation to the rotational speed of the size strip drum 50.However, it is of great importance that the transport rate of the strand stays exactly equal to the transport rate of the tipping wrapper 6 on capstan roller 16. This condition. has to be fulfilled because only then the strand is cut exactly half way between 2 perforations and at a location at which a filling means layer 7 is positioned between the intersection and the next perforation.The first mentioned half way cutting is reached by means of the scanning arm 37. The surface of the tipping wrapper 6, which is coated with the threads 4 and a filling means layer 7, is guided over the guiding shoe 38 which is positioned at the pivotable end of the scanning arm 37. The scanning arm 37 is spring loaded in the direction of the arrow 52 and is supported by a shaft 53.So the position of the shaft 53 can be used as reference for the length of the path of the tipping wrapper 6 between the perforation device 14 and the strand cutter 51.The radial position of the scanning arm is converted into an electrical signal which is fed to an electronic control unit 55 by a line 54, which electronic control unit adjusts the variable transmission between the capstan roller 16 and the size strip drum 50. By way of non restrictive example an epicyclic transmission with outer involute teeth is mentioned not shown . The satellite carrier 58 thereof is connected to a step motor 57 by a tooth belt 56, which step motor rotates the satellite carrier with such a velocity that the desired number of revolutions of the size strip drum 50 is reached. The number of revolutions of the step motor is automatically adjusted by the electronic control unit such, that the transport rate in the strand former 40 is synchronised with the speed at which the tipping wrapper is conveyed through the capstan roller 16.The result of the synchronisation between the capstan roller 16 and the size strip speed is an automatic fixation of the cutting positions with respect to the position of the perforations at both sides of the filling means layers 7 which are positioned close to each other, by keeping the length cf the path of tipping wrapper between the perforation device 14 and the strand cutter 51 constant automatically.The number of revolutions of the driving of the perforation device 14 is translated into an electrical adjusting signal by a tacho generator. The adjusting signals of the position of the scanning arm 37 and the tacho generator are processed by the electronic control unit 55 and are converted into a frequency modulated electric signal, with which the number of revolutions of the step motor 57 is. adjusted preliminary to the driving of the satellite carrier 58 of the epicyclic transmission.The characteristic of the frequency modulated control system is the very short reaction time between measuring and adjusting. This time is much shorter than the acceleration and deceleration time of the machine, so that inwardly and outwardly pendulating phenomenons are kept below a disturbing level during starting and stopping of the machine . The interaction between the scanning arm, the tacho generator, the control unit and the length of the material path forms a pseudo stage locked loop system, which is free of disturbing oscillation phenomenons within the control area.So according to the invention a determined length of filter rods can be manufacured in which 2 or a multiple of 2 future cigarette filters are positioned alternately in opposite direction. Finally one single cigarette filter can be connected to a tobacco column by an extra ring 59 in the way indicated in figure 2.Other embodiments, not shown in the drawing are within the scope of the claims as well.
