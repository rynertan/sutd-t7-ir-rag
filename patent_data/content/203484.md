## Description
VEHICLE ROOF AND THE METHOD FOR ITS CONSTRUCTIONThis invention relates to a roof for a vehicle, particularly a motor vehicle, and a method for constructing said roof.Motor vehicle roofs are known to be formed from a pressed sheet metal part rigid with the body and a series of accessory and finishing elements, which are normally mounted on the assembly line directly on to the already assembled vehicle bodies, resulting in relatively high assembly cost and time, and in particular a relatively poor qualitative yield due to the objective difficulty encountered by the operators in working in often uncomfortable positions in confined spaces.An object of the invention is to provide a vehicle roof, the structure of which allows it to be easily and rapidly mounted on the body and to obtain a high quality of finish. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for constructing and assembling said roof which is of low cost and which enables the working conditions of the assembly line operators to be improved.Said objects are attained according to the invention by a vehicle roof, characterised by comprising a preformed rigid plastics panel arranged to define the upper and lateral inner surfaces of the roof, a transverse support element provided with respective sun visors and with an internal rearview mirror, said element being rigidly fixed to the front end of said preformed panel, respective ventilation ports carried laterally by said preformed panel in proximity to respective handles rigidly fixed thereto, and a pair of concave longitudinal elements rigidly fixed to said preformed panel in correspondence with said port on that upper face of said panel opposite that carrying said support element, said concave elements being arranged to define with said panel respective air feed ducts for said ports.The invention also relates to a method for constructing a vehicle roof, characterised by comprising the following stages assembling the vehicle on the assembly line complete with a pressed sheet metal element defining the load bearing structure of said roof constructing a preformed self supporting rigid plastics panel arranged to define the inner finishing element of said roof constructing a rigid support element and fixing a rearview mirror and sun visors thereon and mounting said support element in a transverse position on the front end of said preformed panel so as to obtain further stiffening thereof mounting a pair of concave longitudinal elements on that upper face of said preformed panel opposite that face thereof carrying said support element, in order to define with said upper face aeration ducts for feeding respective ports formed laterally on said panel during the forming of this latter and mounting said preformed panel on said body against said pressed sheet metal element on the assembly line.The invention will be more apparent froa the non limiting description of one embodiment thereof given herinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of the roof according to the invention andFigure 2 illustrates a stage in the method according to the invention.In Figures 1 and 2, the reference numeral 1 indicates overall a roof for a vehicle 2 of any known type, for example a motor vehicle, comprising a pressed sheet metal element 3 of known type forming an integral part of the vehicle body 4 and defining the load bearing structure of the roof 1, and a self supporting rigid subunit 5 arranged for construction and assembly off the assembly line, and to be mounted rigid with the pressed sheet metal element 3 to form the roof by a single operation which is easily and rapidly carried out.The subunit 5 comprises a preformed rigid plastics panel 6 arranged to define the upper and lateral inner surfaces of the roof 1 when the vehicle 2 has been assembled, said panel thus also defining the finishing element for the roof 1, a rigid support element 7, preferably also preformed of plastics material, in the shape of a cross member to be fixed transversely on to the panel 6 in correspondence with the front end thereof, and a pair of rigid concave elements 9, also preformed of plastics material, to be disposed longitudinally on the panel 6 along sides 10 thereof and against the upper face 11 thereof.The transverse element 7 is rigidly fixed to the panel 6 in any convenient manner, for example by adhesive and or by screws, or snap fitted, against that lower face 12 thereof opposite the face 11, and is positioned substantially perpendicular to the elements 9 to define therewith, perimetrally to the panel 6, a stiffening structure for the panel 6 itself. This latter is provided along its sides 10 with respective holes 14 for housing ventilation ports 15 of known type, and with respective handles 16 fixed rigidly to the panel 6 in proximity to the holes 14. According to the invention, said handles 16 are rigid and are arranged to ensure rigidity of the panel 6 in correspondence with the holes 14.According to the invention, the element 7 lowerly carries an internal rearview mirror 18 and respective sun visors 19, both of known type, and the concave elements 9 define with the face 11 respective feed ducts 20 for the ports 15, and connectable to the ventilation system of the vehicle 2 for example by slots 21 provided through the panel 6. This latter also carries one or more light fittings 32 inserted into respective holes 23, and the face 11 is arranged to carry cables 24 of known type for the various electrical embers of the vehicle 2. Preferably the mirror 18 also carries a seat for the digital clock and other accessories.Finally, according to a preferred embodiment, the roof 1 is also provided with an openable roof panel 30 of known type, which is carried rigidly by the panel 6 by virtue of a rectangular aperture 31 formed in a position adjacent to the element 7 and upperly carrying a projecting rigid frame 32, the openable roof panel 30 being mobile between longitudinal guides 33 of this latter under the control of an operating actuator 34 preferably carried by the frame 32. The pressed sheet metal element 3 is similarly provided with a corresponding aperture 35 to be closed by the openable roof panel 30 and provided in corrrespondence with the aperture 31. According to the invention, the described roof 1 is constructed in the following manner. Firstly the body 4 is assembled on the assembly line in the conventional manner complete with the pressed sheet metal element 3, possibly comprising the aperture 35. Simultaneously the preformed elements 6, 7 and 9 are formed separately of plastics material in known manner, taking care to construct the panel 6 in such a manner that its surface finish is such that it also defines the internal finishing element for the roof 1. The mirror 18 and sun visors 19 are then mounted on the element 7, the element thus obtained being then mounted transversely on the end 12 in order to stiffen this latter.Finally, the ports 15, the light fitting 22 and all other accessories and similar elements plus the cables 24 are mounted on the panel 6 in the respective seats defined by the holes 14 and 23 and by possible cavities formed in the panel 6, and the handles 16 are also mounted, operating off the assembly line. Again operating off the assembly line, the concave elements 9 are mounted on the face 11 to form the ducts 20, and, if provided, the openable roof panel 30 is mounted by inserting and fixing the frame 32 into the aperture 31, to thus obtain the subunit 5, which can be tested off the assembly line as it is already complete with all the elements of the roof 1, including the cables, and is finally mounted on the assembly line rapidly by a single operation, for example by sliding it from the front under the pressed sheet metal element 3 through the windscreen aperture, which is still without its glass, and then fixing it to the pressed sheet metal element 3 and to the rest of the body 4 by adhesive and or by screws or blocks.The advantages of the method according to the invention in terms of economy and greater accuracy and ease of assembly are apparent from the aforegoing description. By virtue of the particular roof structure it is also apparent that the method of the invention results in considerable operational flexibility, to enable the panel 6 to be fitted out in numerous other ways without additional expense, by simply grouping the various components in a different manner thereon, it being sufficiently rigid to act as a load bearing element and a reinforcement for the pressed sheet metal element 3. It has been surprisingly found that this high rigidity of the subunit 5 is obtainable exclusively by virtue of the particular structure defined by the panel 6 and by the elements 7 and 9 rigidly fixed thereto, this structure therefore being critical for the purposes of attaining the objects of the invention. In this respect, it is exclusively this structure which enables the aperture for the openable roof panel to be provided without any fear of prejudicing the rigidity of the panel 6, so enabling it to be fitted out in various ways while using the same elements, and to form a particularly light roof. The technical advantages in terms of economy of scale connected with the invention are obvious.Finally, it is apparent that modifications can be made to the aforegoing but without leaving the scope of the invention.
