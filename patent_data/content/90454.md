# Process for the manufacture of a preparation having a high content of phosphatidylcholine from a phosphatide mixture.

## Abstract
A preparation having a high content of phosphatidylcho line is prepared from a phosphatide mixture by admixing a so lution of such a phosphatide mixture in an alcohol having 1 3 caroon atoms with an aqueous or an alcoholic solution of a salt of a bi or trivalent metal, especially a magnesium salt, and preferably magnesium sulphate, in such an amount that most of the phosphatidylcholine is left in solution whereas most of the other phosphatides are precipitated. The precipitate is separated from the solution and the preparation with a high content of phosphatidylcholine is isolated from the remaining solution by evaporation. The amount of salt to be used is 1 20 , preferably 3 8 by weight relative to the weight of the dry phosphatide mixture. The starting material can be a crude phosphatide mixture, a desugared and or defatted mixture, a mixture partly enriched with respect to phosphatidylcholine, etc. Preparations with 70 phosphatidylcholine or higher can be obtained with this process.

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A PREPARATION ERAING A HIGF CONTENT OF PFIOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE FROM A PHOSPHATIDEMIXTUREThe invention relates to a process for the manufacture oE a preparation having a high content of phosphatidylcholine from a phosphatide mixture by admixing an alcoholic solution of the phosphatide mixture with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of a sufficiently soluble salt of a bi or trivalent metal.Phosphatides, especially those occurring in crude vegetable fats and oils from which they are isolated by methods known in the art, are esters of phosphatidic acids diacylglycerylphosphoric acids and N containing alcohols such as 2 aminoethanol colamine , 2 amino 3hydroxy propanoic acid serine , and trimethyl 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium hydroxide choline , and N free hydroxy compounds, SllCh as inositol.Of these phosphatides, the ester of choline, viz.phosphatidylcholine is rated high as a pharmaceutical compound, as an emulsifier or for dietetic purposes.Therefore, in both patent and scientific technological literature processes are described to separate the phosphatides present in phosphatide mixtures and to isolate the fraction wanted. There are processes in which separation is accomplished by using the different solubilities in organic solvents, by adsorption, by chromatographic separation, and by ion exchange. All these processes have their advantages and their drawbacks.There are also processes known in which phosphatides are treated with metal salts and isolated as metal salt complexes. As early as 1926 it was described in the Swiss patent specification No. 127 256 to obtain a lecithin preparation by precipitation from an alcoholic solution with calcium chloride. From the complex obtained the lecithin can be recovered, but from the description it is not clear whether lecithin proper, i.e. phosphatidylcholine, or a phosphatide mixture without much impurity is meant. G. Elenbogen described in the United States patent No. 3 081 320, assigned to Baxter LaboratoriesInc., to precipitate an insoluble calcium salt of phosphatidic acids present by adding calciumhydroxide or acetate to a solution of an alcohol soluble fraction of phosphatide in ethanol this leaves an alcoholic solution of the phosphatides which are apparently not separated in this way.Other processes are known from German patent No. 1 070 484 to Socit Franchise de RecherchesBiochimiques fi. Besson Cie., claiming priority from 27 04 1956 and 29 03 1957. In this specification it is described that a solution of a crude phosphatide mixture, preferably defatted with acetone, in 95 100 ethanol is treated with a solution of magnesium sulphate in methanol or water. When methanol is used, a complex is precipitated. When water is used, a thick paste is obtained which is solidified further by adding acetone.In this process a complex of phosphatidylcholine is precipitated with magnesium sulphate from a lecithin preparation substantially free of phosphatidylcolamine, obtained by treating one part of crude phosphatide mixture with 5 10 parts of magnesium oxide. The precipitate contains up to 28 of magnesium sulphate, which is not removed. The phosphatidylcholine is precipitated by at least 0,5 part by weight of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate per part of phosphatidylcholine.It has now been found that separation of the phosphatides present in a phosphatide mixture can be accomplished by treating an alcoholic solution of such a mix ture with sufficiently soluble salts of di and trivalent metals dissolved in an alcohol or in water, in an amount which precipitates phosphatidylcolamine and phosphatidylserine in addition to phosphatidic acid , but substantially leaves phosphatidylcholine in solution.The following Table shows the effect of this invention extracted from figures given in the Examples in more detail EMI3.1 tb Example SEP SEP MgSO4 SEP yield SEP of SEP phosphatides tb SEP 1 SEP of SEP amount tb SEP starting SEP phosphatidyl SEP phosphatidyl tb SEP material SEP choline SEP colamine tb SEP VI SEP 1.0 SEP 100 SEP 56 tb SEP IV SEP 2.4 SEP 80 SEP 13 tb SEP I SEP 3.7 SEP 79 SEP 6 tb SEP 3.9 SEP g SEP SEP 3.9 SEP SEP 88 SEP 12 tb The phosphatide mixture used as starting material can be the crude mixture as obtained by desliming oils and fats, possibly defatted.One can also start from mixtures which were purified further by removal of sugars, fats and other non phosphatide contaminants. One can also start from phosphatide mixtures already partly enriched in phosphatidylcholine or fractions remaining from such an enrichment. Although the main purpose may be to obtain preparations with a high proportion of phosphatidylcholine, the fractions which contain high proportions of other phosphatides, such as phosphatidylcolamine need not be discarded but may be used for other useful purposes.For the present process the phosphatide mixture is dissolved in an aliphatic alcohol with 1 3 carbon atoms methanol is preferably used, but ethanol containing up to 25 water, and 2 propanol can also be employed. The concentration is from about 5 wt. to about 35 wt. , preferably between 10 and 25 wt. .As appears from screening experiments, a lot of wateror alcohol soluble salts of di or trivalent cations such as magnesium, zinc, calcium, cadmium and aluminium cations can precipitate phosphatidylcolamine and phosphatidic acid from alcoholic solutions and leave phosphatidylcholine in solution. Obviously, for food and pharmaceutical uses only non toxic salts are to be used.The salts are, before being admixed with the phosphatide solution, dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as an alcohol or water, in which they must be sufficiently soluble. Both hydrates of the salts and anhydrous salts can be used. Salts that can be used include magnesium sulphate, magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide, magnesium nitrate, and magnesium acetate. Magnesium sulphate is preferred, for both selectivity and toxicological reasons. The concentration of the salt solution is preferably as high as possible for easy treatment, but lower concentrations can be used without disadvantage. As solvents can be used aliphatic alcohols with 1 3 carbon atoms, methanol being preferred, and water.The amount of salt, calculated as the anhydrous salt, relative to the weight of the phosphatide starting material is 1 20 , preferably 3 8 , and depends on the content of phosphatides to be precipitated. With higher amounts phosphatidylcholine is also precipitated, with lower amounts phosphatidylcolamine etc. is left in solution. The temperature at which the precipitation can be performed is 0 75 C, but only slight differences are observed at different temperatures. There is therefore no need to operate at other temperatures than ambient temperature or slightly higher.After the phosphatide solution and the salt solution has been mixed carefully and the precipitate has been formed, the mixture is stirred well to avoid inclusion of solute in the precipitate as well as possible the precipitate is then removed from the remaining solution by decanting, by filtration, by centrifuging or by other suitable means. The remaining solution is evaporated, possibly under reduced pressure, leaving a preparation enriched in phosphatidylcholine.For further enrichment the process can be repeated.The preparation can further be purified by removing sugars and fats, which can also be done before the precipitation process or repetition of the process.By the process invented, a preparation containing over 702 or even over 80 phosphatidylcholine can be obtained.The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which do not however limit the scope of the invention. Example ITo a solution of 100 g defatted ethanol soluble part of soyaphosphatide in one litre methanol, 15 g of an aqueous solution containing 3.7 g magnesium sulphate concentration 244 g kg was added while stirring amount 0.037 g MgS04 per g phosphatide . The precipitate was filtered off using 50 g silicagel as filter aid. The filtered solution was evaporated leaving 65 g product.The product was analyzed for the various phosphatides by thin layer chromatography according to Fette, Seifen, Anstrichmittel, 63, 11191123 1961 for the water soluble part as follows 5 g product was dissolved in 200 ml of a mixture of 2 parts of chloroform and 1 part of methanol 40 ml water were then added and the whole shaken for 2 min. The mixture was centrifuged, the upper phase separated and evaporated in vacuum. The residue, being the water soluble part, was weighed after drying at 60 C for nitrogen Kjeldahl for magnesium by atomic absorption spectrophotometry see e.g. W.T. Elwell and J.A.F.
