# A magazine for flat cartons, prefolded leaflets and the like.

## Abstract
An orbital feeder for flat folded cartons 15 , feeds the cartons from a stationary magazine 20 to a continuously moving conveyor 11 . The magazine has a choke at its dis charge end formed from parallel guides 141, 142 which are spaced apart a distance less than the distance between the two folded edges of the cartons. A rotary carrier 25 is lo cated adjacent the magazine and the conveyor. A plurality of planetary members 26 , with attached suction cups 36 are rotatably mounted on the carrier. A fixed cam 30 co operates with cam followers 2a mounted on the planetary members to cause the planetary members to rotate on their own axes as the carrier rotates to pick up cartons from the magazine open them and deposit them gently between transport lugs 12, 13 on the conveyor. The relatively simple feeder mechanism withdraws folded cartons from the magazine and deposits them erect on the conveyor quickly and efficiently.
