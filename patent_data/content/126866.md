More preferably R1 and R2 are methyl and R3 is a neopently acrylate radical having 8 C. A neopently acrylate radical having 8 C is represented by the formula EMI6.2 By a neopently acrylate radical having 8 to 10 C it is meant not only the acrylate as depicted in the formula above , but also the methacrylate or ethacrylate.

The organic amine salt compounds preferably are unsaturated via R1, R2 or R3 and R4, thus providing the capability of themselves forming a polymer. More preferably, the polymerizable composition contains at least one polymerizable organic compound other than the organic amine salt compound. Thus, in its preferred embodr.ent and its greatest presently contemplated utility, the preferred organic amine salt is included in a composition with at least one polymerizable organic compound other than the organic amine salt. The organic amine salt can be chosen from the group consisting of polymerizable and unpolymerizable organic amine salts and mixtures thereof. The polymerizable organic compound excluding the amine salt compound is inclusive of all organic. compounds and combined tions of compounds that are polymerizable but those preferred are the ethylenically unsaturated compounds, which should be free radical polymerizable. A suitable compound is a monomer containing ethylenic unsaturation in a terminal group. For example, the ethylenically unsaturated material may be one or more monomers selected from vinyl monomers, allyl monomers and vinylidene monomers. Suitable vinyl monomers which may be polymerized include, for example, vinyl esters, aromatic vinyl compounds and vinyl nitriles. Vinyl esters suitable for use in the method of our invention include, for example, vinyl acetate. Preferably, the predominant polymerizable composition is an acrylate polymerized predominantly through addition polymerization, more preferable one chosen from the group consisting of mono and multifunctional acrylates. By acrylate as used in this phraseology, it is meant to include the acrylates and methacrylates. Especially preferred compounds are the mltifunc tional acrylates such as 1, 6 hexandiol dimethacrylate and the urethane dimethacrylate oligomers. By at least one polymerizable organic compound, it will be understood in this application to mean one or more such corapounds. The preferred polymerization initiator compound is a radiationactivatable compound. In some instances, a heat activatabe initiator compound may also bp included. Mole preferably, the radiation activatable compound is an a t nic light activatable compound. Such compounds are well known, see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,245,031, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Most preferably, the initiator is a visible light activatablecompound making the polymerizable composition curable with visible light. The preferred class of initiators is the well known diketones and the most preferred is camphoroquinone.

In addition to the primary polymer2z√Öation acX onstitutients of the composition discussed above, large quantities of other ingredients may be present, for example, the silaneous fillers and other fillers by way of example apatite, soda glass, quartz, silica gel, borosilicate glass, alumina, metal fibres and particulate polymer. These may be in the form of spheres, platelets, fibres, whiskers or they may be irregularly shaped. Many other constitutients may also be present, such as stabilizing agents, plasticizers, inert diluents, solvents, pigments, opaquing agents, etc. Such materials are discussed in the previously referenced two patents. Such teachings are wellknown and their repetition is therefore unnecessary. In some embodiments, substantial filler may be present and it is preferred to have a filler content of 0 to 70 percent of the polymerizable composition on a volume basis based on total volume of the polmerizable composition, and in many filled compositions where the present invention has special significance in enabling adequate cure, 35 to 70 percent and even 45 to 70 percent. An important feature of the present invention is the provision of a system in its preferred forms that will cure in response to visible light quickly to a high degree of cure and to substantial depths. This highly chemically reactive photoresponsive material is storage stable at 20 0C for at least one week under light free conditions in its preferred forms, and can achieve storage stability of more than a year. The invention provides by the recited means a method of modifying the polymerization of polymerizable compositions.These means having been recited in detail in the discussion of the compositions will not be repeated here as the method of the THE METHOD OF FORMING THE ORGANIC AMINE SAL While the organic a ine salt of an acid may be formed by other means, the preferred method and the method of the present invention that will produce an arrine salt of an acid is given below. E an orcanic ar ine salt as used herein, it is meant as previously stated, the salt as described earlier in this application and as contrasted with betaines in the BACKGROUND OFTHE INVENTION section of this application. First, separate feed stocks of an organic amine and an acid are formed. These feed stocks are then brought together under conditions such that one of the combined feed stocks is below 0 C at the time of combining. Preferably both the organic amine feed stock and the acid feed stock are cooled to at least 0 C before the feed stocks are combined. More preferably, the acid is an rale c acid and the cooling is to a degree that solidifies the organic acid and the organic acid and organic amine are brouch together in reaction with the organic acid initially in a solid state and the reaction is exothermic. The preferred orcanic amines and the preferred organic acid reactants are those previously described in this application with the preferred and previously determined efficacies of this invention being those previously indicated. Preferably the organic amine salt is formed under nonaqueous conditions. As disclosed in Example 2, small quantities of the organic amine salt can be prepared conveniently without cooling. This is believed to be the situation because the very small quantity does nct heat excessively during the exetherm of the reaction. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples EXAMPLE 1 An organic amine salt of an acid was formed by preparing two feed stocks as follows 92.8 g glacial methacrylic acid MAA 99.3 purity, with 250 ppm methyl ether hydroquinone MEHQ was charged to an amber glass bottle. 0.28 g buylated hydroxytoluene BHT was added to the MAA and shaken until dissolved into a uniform solution. The MAA solution was placed into a freezer set at 12 C for about one hour. The solution became a frozen solid. At substantially the same time, about 200 g of 3 dimethyl aminoneopentyl acrylate DMANPA also known as 3 N,N dimethylamino 2,2 dimethylpropyl acrylate 99 purity with 50 ppm MEHQ was charged to an amber glass bottle and placed in the freezer set at 120C for about one hour. The DMANPA did not freeze and remained liquid. Both bottles were removed from the freezer and 185 a DMANPA was poured onto the frozen MAA solid. The combined MAS and DMANPA were then shaken vigorously on a mechanical shaker.The exotherm of the salt reaction melted the frozen MAA and the amine salt formed as a liquid. Shaking was continued for 10 minutes to ensure complete reaction. A slight stochiometric excess of MAA was used for odor modification in Example 1 to compensate for the impurities inherently present in the starting materials. The theoretical molar equivalent for DMANPA MAA amine salt is 185 86 DMANPA MAA .Experience indicates that a DMANPA MAA ratio lower than 185 95 tends to slow down the photoaccelerators efficiency. EXAMPLE 2 EXAMPLE 2 Another 1 1 mole ratio acid amine salt reaction product was formed by reacting 8.6 g of MAA and 15.7 g of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate DMAEMA by combining these small quantities at room temperature in a 2 oz amber glass container at room temperature and shaking them on a mechanical shaker for about one half hour and then letting stand for about one hour before using.It is believed that the cooling is not necessary because of the small quantities involved. The resulting amine salt DMAEMA MAA was a clear, slightly viscous liquid. To determine the nature of the compound formed, infrared spectra were run on glacial methacrylic acid MAA , dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate DMAEMA and the above reaction product DMAEMA MAA . The spectra confirm that the DMAEMA MAA salt is a new compound and not just a simple physical mixture of MAA and DMAEMA. The differences of the spectra are very obvious and can be explained as follows I. Disappearance of Free COOH Group The DMAEMA MAA salt has an entirely new form in the 2500 3300 cm region. The broad and strong COOH band due to OH vibration of MAA in this region changed after the reaction.Noticeable also is the disappearance of the strong OH vibration at 2650 cm 1, 2750 cm √ö, and 1750 cm 1 In addition, the C O vibrations in MAA at 1715cm 1 and D SEMA 1740 cm √ö have been shifted to 1725 cm in the new salt. II. Formation of COO Salt The new bands formed in DMAEMA MAA spectra inthe 2400 2600 cm region and the 1850 2050 cm region are indications of the new COO salt formation. The new band in the 1550 1620 cm √ö region and the higher intensity band at 1410 cm 1 also indicated the formation of COO salt, or CH2 compounds. Additionally, the missing of 1115 cm band due to C N stretching in DMAEMA after the reaction indicated the nature of the C N bond has been changed. In conclusion, the I.R. spectra evidenced the following believed reaction between DMAEMA and MAA EMI14.1 DMAEMA MAA salt EXAMPLE 3 Another experiment was carried out to demonstrate the nature of the reaction product of the DMAEMA MAA reaction prepared according to Example 2. The volatility of the DMAEMA, MAA and the reaction product was measured by, placing 5 grams of each of the three in 10 ml bottles and storing, them open for six days at room temperature. The following weight changes were observed pure Methacrylic acid weight loss 5.0 pure DMAEMA weight loss 4.6 Both MAA and DMAEMA showed vapor loss during open storage. Surprisingly, the amine acid salt D4AEMA MAA showed no vapor loss during open storage. Instead, it gained some weight.The lower vapor pressure can be regarded as an advantage from the toxicity viewpoint. No vapor loss may indicate a less hazardous work environment. EXAMPLE 4 7 The following experiments were carried out in order to help understand the chemical nature of DMAEMA and MAA reaction product. The materials were added in the order listed at room temperature. Example 4 Example 5 Example E Example 7Materials 1 2cc Distilled 2cc Distilled 2cc Distilled The solution fror..

The strong base WaOE displaced the weak baseDMAEMA and formed a new salt MAA Na . Free DMAEMA was released and thus produced the strong amine For. Because of the higher density of the new salt, DMAEMA floated to the top instead of being at the bottom as in Example 5.We believe these results and those or the previous examples prove that an arlne salt has formed by the reaction of the amine and acid. EXAMPLES 8 1t The following examples are believed especially illustrative of the relative cure rate of DMAEMA MAA amine salt compared with DMAEMA and MAA used alone. 100 gram solutions ofExamples 8, 9, 10 and 11 were prepared in four ounce amber bottles at room temperature. About one ml of each solution was transferred to 6 x 50 mm clear borosilicate glass culture tubes and exposed to 140 mw cm2 of visible light supplied by a 150 watt quartz halogen lamp with a 400 500 nm bandpass filter.

Example 10 with an equimolar amount of DMAEMA MAA cured to a rigid solid in 60 seconds. MAA did not act as a photoaccelerator as shown by the lack of cure of Example 11. It was concluded from this experiment that the cure rate of camphoroquinone initiated photopolymerizations were accelerated by DMAEMA MAA up to twice as fast as with DMAEMA. DMAEMA MAA is a difunctional methacrylate as well as a photoaccelerator capable of polymerization with the addition of initiator The following example is illustrative of the homopolymerization of DMAEMA MAA. EXAMPLE 12 0.3 a camphorocn none was dissolved in 99.7 grams ot DMAEMA MAA prepared as in Example 2 in a 4 oz. amber glass bottle. About one ml of the solution was transferred to a glass culture tube and cured as described in Example 8 11. After exposure 6 minutes of lights the solution cured to a clear rigid solid polymer which was soluble in water. When copolymerized with a minor amount of a crosslinking polymer such as 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate, the copolymer is water insoluble. EXAMPLE 13 16 Photocacceleration speed of amines and amine salt was tested as follows Solutions containing 100 c 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate, 0.30 g camphoroquinone and 0.E8 g amine or amine salt prepared according to Example l were prepared and tested for cure rate. The gel time was recorded in seconds as the time required for the liquid monomer to gel and start to shrink away from the wall of the glass culture tube. The solution was cured as described above. The results in increasing effectiveness decreasing gel time are as follows Relative vole RelativeExample and Amine Salt Ratio Gel Time Gel TimeEs. 13 N Methyldiethanol 1.00 135 sec. 2.37 amine DMEA Ex. 14 Dimethylaminoethyl 0.76 71 sec. 1.25 methacrylate DMAEMA Ex. 15 Dimethylaminoethyl 0.48 60 sec. 1.05 methacrylate Methacrylic acid salt DMAFMA MAA Ex. 16 Dimethylamino 0.44 57 sec. 1.00 neopentyl acrylate Methacrylic acid salt DMANPA MAA As can be seen frort. the above cata, DMANPA MAA salt is more than twice as fast as MDEA of the same weight ratio or onlyC.44 mole ratio relative to MDEA . The DMANPA MAA salt is also about 25 faster than DMAEMA. EXAMPLES 17 25 The following examples are especially illustrative of the effect of amine and amine salts on the depth of cure of visible light curable compositions. A pigmented polymer powder blend was prepared from the pigments, fiber, fumed silica and polymer in a V Cone Blender.Solutions of HDDMA containing CQ and the amine or amine salts prepared as described in Example 1 were prepared in four ounce amber bottles. 10g of each solution was combined with 10g grams of powder blend in a four ounce amber bottle and allowed to gel for two hours before testing. The depth of cure was measured in Teflon molds in a cylindrical cavity 5 mm deep and 8 mm in diameter. The bottom of the cavity was covered with a cellophane sheet backed up by a glass slide. The compositions of Example 17 25 were packed into the mold and covered with a cellophane sheet. The compositions were cured for three minutes by 132 mDs cm2 of visible light supplied by a 150 watt quartz halogen lamp with a 400 500 nm band pass filter.The sample was pushed out of the mold and the uncured material was scraped off the bottom with a knife. The bottom was smoothed with 600 grit sandpaper. The height of the cylinder was measured by a . micrometer to 0.01 mm as the depth of cure.

EXAMPLE 2 6 The color stability of amines and amine salts is illus trated as follows Solutions containing 50 g HDDMA, 50 g urethane dimethacrylate Plex 6661 0 Rohm G.M.B.H , 0.3 g CO and 5.73 x moles of the amine or amine salt as listed below were prepared as previously described in Examples 13 16. The solutions were cast into Plexiglas molds with cylindrical cavities 3 mm deep and 20 mm in diameter. They were then cured using the light and method described in Examples 17 25 except the cure time was two minutes on each side. Three cured discs of each sample were then masked half way with aluminum foil and placed in a QW Weatherometer, manufactured by Q Panel. The fourth disc was removed and placed in dark storage for comparison. Each weathering cycle in the QW unit includes 4 hours UV at 600C, followed by 4 hours condensation at 500C. The total exposure time is 233 1 2 hours. The samples were then removed and ranked by the degree of discoloration as observed visually by the unaided human eye. For all samples masked with aluminum foil, no discoloration was observed. The exposed sections showed various degrees of discoloration and were ranked in the following sequence. Wt. of Amine or Degree Amine or Amine Salt Amine Salt of Discoloration MDEA 0.68 Severe DMAEMA 0.90 Moderate DMAEMA MAA Salt 1.40 Moderate DMANPA 1.06 Light DMANPA MAA Salt 1.56 Light DMANPA MAA Salt 0.68 Light Control no amine or amine salt Light. Light As can be seen from the above results, D1ANPA MAA Salt has excellent color stability, while both DMAEMA and MDEA have very poor color stability, with MDEA being the most color unstable. EXAMPLES 27 70 Examples 27 to 70 especially illustrate the influence on acceleration of the cure rate, as measured by the gel time, of the amine salts compared to the amines for a broad variety of different amines and acids. The examples show that the amine salts gave shorter gel times than the amines at Equimolar concentrations, with the exception of the amine salts of very strong acids.Examples 58 to 70 illustrate amine salts that were not useful as accelerators since they were insoluble in the HDDMA or the amines and acids were incompatable in the test monomer solution. The amine salts were prepared according to Example 2.The solutions were prepared substantially as in Example 13 except 5.76 x 10 6 moles of amine or amine salt were used with the 100 grams of 1,6 hexandiol dimethacrylate and 0.3 g camphoroquinone CQ .

EXAMPLE 76 A composition that is moldable to a denture base form and hardenable with visible light was prepared from the following ingredients Percent by Weight of Total Composition 39.44 Urethane dimethacrylate Reaction product of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 2,2,4 trimethylhexyl 1,6 diisocyanate 2.57 HDDMA 0.13 CQ 0.59 DMAEMA MAA salt prepared as in Example 2 42.10 poly methyl methacrylate co ethylene dimethacrylate 99.8 0.2 a polymer supplied by L. D. Caulk Co Polymer is in substantially spherical beads the shape resulting from its suspension polymerization. At least 50 by weight of the beads have average diameters of less than 50 microns. The polymer was prepared from methyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacry late by suspension polymerization . 0.07 red acetate fibers 0.03 pigments 15.07 fumed silica inorganic filler Aerosil R972 a product of Degussa First CQ was dissolved in HDDMA and then mixed with the amine salt and urethane dimethacrylate. The resulting liquid solution was charged to a double planetary mixer heated to 450C and mixed under 20 mm Hg pressure. Next the polymer The polymer was prepared according to the teaching of U.S. Serial No. 318,356, filed Nov. 5, 1981, which was a Continuation of U.S. Serial No. 008,507, filed Feb. 1, 1977. with the pigments and fibers previously blended in a V ConeBlender was added and mixed under 20 mm pressure. The temperature was increased to 550C and the fumed silica was added in three increments of about equal size and mixed under 130 mm pressure each time. This produced the visible light curable VtC putty paste of this invention. The VLC putty was molded into a sheet 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.10 in a hydraulic press. The sheet was adapted as a baseplate to a stone model boated with separator made from an impression of the mouth. The baseplate was trimmed and then cured in two minutes on a turntable rotating under four 150 watt quartz halogen lamps with a 400 500 nm band pass filter. The light flux varied from 100 130 mw cm2 on the surface of the baseplate. Additional VLC putty was rolled into rope 0.25 in diameter. The rope was adapted around the ridge of the baseplate and a full arch of acrylic plastic teeth coated with a bonding agent was press positioned in the rope. The teeth were further positioned in an articulator and then fixed in position by a two minute light cure. Next the facial and lingual aspects of the denture were finished with additional rope.The denture was coated with an oxygen barrier coating then light cured for two minutes. The denture was removed from the model, coated with an oxygen barrier coating and then cured two minutes. The denture was polished by the usual means, cleaned in an ultrasonic bath and rinsed. The denture was inserted into a human mouth, found in the reported opinion of the clinician, to be equal to or superior to dentures made with conventional denture materials by conventional methods. EXAMPLE 77 100 g of a visible light curable composition useful as opaquing medium for dental alloys was prepared by dissolving and mixing the following ingredients 50.91 acrylate urethane oligomer Urethane 782 30.46 dicyclopentenyloxyethyl nethacrylate QM 657 Rohm Haas Co. 9.73 MAA 3.05 TiO2 3.05 fumed silica Aerosil R972 0.36 CO 2.44 D.MAEMAlAA salt, prepared as in Example 2 The resulting composition was a viscous, yet flowable opaque white liquid. Rectangular tabs measuring about 0.35 x 1 00 x 0.05 were cast from a nickel chromium based dental alloy sold under the trademark BIOBOND, manufactured by Dentsply International Inc. . They were ground and sandblasted with aluminum oxide and then tin plated for 30 seconds with Tin Alkaline 5001, a tin plating solution supplied by Liquid Development Corp., and oxidized with 5 hydrogen peroxide solution for 15 seconds. After drying withDust Chaser dichlorodifluoromethane , supplied by VWR ScientificInc., the above opaquing medium was brushed onto half of the metal tab and then cured for 3 minutes under the light as in Examples 17 25. A visible light curable dental composite sold under the trademark PRISMA FIL, manufactured by The L. D. Caulk Co., a division of Dentsply International Inc. was then applied over the cured opaquing medium, and cured for an additional 3 minutes. The above cured laminates were conditioned in 37 C deionized water for 40 hours. After that, the samples were subjected to boiling water for 30 seconds, followed by ice water for 30 seconds thermocycling for 30 cycles. An aluminum tab, measuring about 0.45 x 1.25 x 0.10 was glued over the previously referred to dental C C composite surrace with a structural sive vers , manufactured by Lord Corp. . The samples were then subjected to lap shear tensile bond strength test t 0.05 inch per minute head speed, using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The measured failure strength was 618 psi. The failure occurred at the interface between aluminum and the structural adhesive, indicating that the bond strength was more than the 618 psi. Examples 8 11 and 13 26 are beljeved to have c eally demonstrated that the DMANPA MAA is a much more efficient and color stable photoaccelerator than either MDEA or DMAEMA. The preferred organic tertiary amine salt of the present invention is a photoaccelerator that offers real advantages in visible light cured dental and industrial products that require faster cure and or greater depth of cure. The preferred amine a difunctional salt is monomer and coreactive with the system polymerized.Because it is coreactive at both its amine moiety and acid moiety it is bound in the polymer system and thus not generally subject to being leached out under the harsh fluctuations between acid and alkaline materials that are constantly placed in the oral environment during the consumption of foods. It was surprising that the formation of the salt did not block the action of the tertiary amine group in the tertiary amine salts when used as photoaccelerators. It was even more surprising that the salt acts as a superior accelerator to the tertiary amines themselves. The foregoing description illustrates preferred embodiments of the invention. However, concepts employed may, based upon such description, be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following claims are intended to protect the invention broadly, as well as in the specific forms shorn herein.
