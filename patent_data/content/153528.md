# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A hyper expansion internal combustion engine operable using a cycle having expansion, exhaust, intake and com pression phases comprising at least one pair of opposed pistons 20,22 which reciprocate in cylinder portions 6, 8 which are in fluid communication with each other via a common combustion chamber, the pistons 20, 22 being coupled to respective cam elements 66, 70 engaged with a common output shaft 74 for converting the reciprocating motion of the pistons 20, 22 into rotational motion, the cylinder portions 6, 8 having intake and exhaust ports 12, 14 in the cylinder walls arranged such that each intake port 12 is engaged by one piston 20 and each exhaust port 14 is engaged by the respective opposed piston 22 and the cam elements 66, 70 are provided with different cam profiles 64, 68 which are arranged to cause the respective pistons 20, 22 to uncover the respective exhaust and inlet ports 12, 14 so as to produce a sufficient increase in the effective volume of the expansion phase with respect to the intake phase to give hyper expansion.
