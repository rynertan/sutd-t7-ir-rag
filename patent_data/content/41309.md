## Description
Method and plant for making gypsum products. This invention relates to a method of making gypsum products, which comprises pre drying and subsequently grinding crude lumps of gypsum, calcining the ground crude gypsum, adding water to the calcined gypsum to produce a material, forming the desired final products from said material, and drying the final products, and also to a plant for carrying out said method. Such a method and plant are already being used, for example, for the production of gypsum board panels.A disadvantage of the prior technique is that it takes a relatively large amount of energy. Thus the predrying and calcining of the crude gypsum and the drying of the final product require large heating installations, which consume substantial amounts of fuel, generally natural gas, while transportation between the various processing stations and the grinding of the crude gypsum lumps need a great deal of electrical power. It is an object of the present invention to improve a method and plant of the kind described in such a manner that energy requirements are reduced. For this purpose, according to the invention, a method of the k.nd described is characterized by the use tf a gas turbine, which drives an electrical generator, End that the heist required for the calcining step is taken from the flue gases of the gas turbine. The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.In said drawings, Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows a prior plant for the manufacture of gypsum products and Fig. 2 diagrammatically shows such a plant according to the present invention. Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows the processing of crude gypsum lumps into a ready final product. A storage space for the crude gypsum lumps is diagrammatically indicated at 1. The crude gypsum lumps are transported from the storage space to a pre drying installation, which is provided for the purpose with gas burners, not shown, to which natural gas or another suitable gas is supplied through a conduit 3. After pre drying, whereby water vapour and flue gases are released, as indicated by an arrow 4, the dried crude gypsum is transported to a grinder 5, and from the grinder the ground crude gypsum is supplied to an intermediate storage space 6. From storage space 6 the crude gypsum is supplied to a calciner 7. In it the crude gypsum is dried to remove water of crystallization.For this purpose the crude gypsum is heated by means of one or more gas burners, not shown, to which natural gas or another suitable gas is supplied through a conduit 8, whereby water vapour and flue gases are released, as indicated by arrows 9. After calcining, the gypsum is transferred to second intermediate storage space 10, and subsequently, with addition of water as indicated at 11, transported from storage space 10 to an apparatus 12 for forming the final product. The final product may, for example, consist of gypsum board sheet or other gypsum products. The final product is finally passed through a dryer 13, equipped with gas burners,. not shown, to which natural gas or another suitable gas is supplied through a conduit 14.Flue gas and water vapour are released from the dryer at 15. The various transport devices and the grinding device of the plant described above are driven by electric power.The wire and motors required for this are not shown. Fig. 2 shows a plant largely similar to that ofFigure 1, in which corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numerals as in Figure 1. The plant shown in Figure 2 is distinguished from that of Figure 1 in that a gas turbine 20 has been added, to which natural gas or another suitable gas is supplied.This turbine has a dual purpose. First the flue gases from the turbine can be used to take over, in full or in part, the function of the various gas burners described hereinbefore. Second, the turbine can drive an electrical generator 21, capable of supplying the electrical power required for the plant. In certain cases it is possible to make the plant fully self supporting as far as electrical power is concerned, that is to say, a connection with the public electricity supply is no longer necessary. In practice, this connection will mostly be maintained, however, in order that breakdown may be taken care of, and in order that a possible excess of electrical energy, which is not needed for the production of the gypsum products, or for the domestic use in appurtenant office accommodation and the like, may be dissipated to the public mains. The above described gas conduits and burners are also preferably maintained in order that, if necessary, additional heating may be provided, or heating may be taken over in full, should the gas turbine fail. As a first step, according to the invention, the flue gases from the gas turbine were supplied through a conduit 22 to the calciner 7. Experiments showed, however, that the flue gases given off by the calciner still had such a calorific value that further use thereof should be possible. This, however, makes it necessary for the flue gases from the calciner to be separated from the water vapour also given off by the calciner. Accordingly, according to the present invention, use is made of an apparatus in which the gypsum is calcined at least in part indirectly, that is to say, that the heating gases, at least a portion thereof, do not come into direct contact with the gypsum. The heat transfer is effected through the walls of the calcining chamber, and if desired through tubes with closed walls extending through the calcining compartment.In this manner the flue gases leaving the calciner can be separately collected for further use. According to the invention, the flue gases leaving the calciner are supplied through piping 23 to the dryer 13 for the final products. When gas turbine 20 is dimensioned so that generator 21 can meet the requirement of electrical energy, the amount of flue gas is so large that this is not all required for the calcining process. On the other hand, the calorific value of the flue gases leaving the calciner is not sufficient to meet the heat requirements of the dryer for the final products completely, if at least apparatus 12 directly processes all gypsum supplied by the calciner through the intermediate storage space 10. For that reason conduit 22 is provided with a branch conduit 24, which terminates direct in piping 23, so that flue gases with a higher calorific value are supplied to dryer 13. Furthermore, conduit 22 may be provided with a second branch conduit 25, through which a portion of flue gases from the turbine can be supplied to pre dryer 2. Whether in a practical situation, the flue gases from the gas turbine, together with the flue gases passed through the calciner are indeed sufficient to cover the heat requirements of the dryer for the end products and possibly the pre dryer depends on a number of factors, such as the efficiency of the gas turbine selected, the requirement of electrical power, the efficiency of the calciner, the efficiency of the dryer, etc. If these requirements cannot be fully covered, it will be necessary to provide for additonal firing. It is observed that various variants of the method and plant described are obvious. Thus, for example, the flue gases leaving the calciner may be partially supplied to the pre dryer, and the balance of these flue gases may be supplied to the dryer for the end products together with flue gases coming direct from the gas turbine. Conduit 25 is then superfluous, but a conduit 26, indicated in dash lines in Figure 2 is required. Another variant is that in which the gas burners of the dryer 13 and or of the calciner, and or of the pre dryer remain, at least in part, in operation, and in which the oxygen requirements of these burners are fully or partially met by passing flue gases from the gas turbine to the burners concerned. For this purpose one or more of the conduits 28, 29, 30, diagrammatically indicated in dash outline,may be provided. This may result in a considerable saving of blower power needed for the supply and discharge of gases. As an alternative of conduit 30, if conduit 26 to the pre dryer is provided, the latter may be connected through a conduit 31, indicated by a dash line, to the gas burners for the pre dryer. These and other variants, for example those in which the gypsum is calcined not indirectly but directly, are obvious to those skilled in the art and hence deemed to fall within the scope of the present invention.
