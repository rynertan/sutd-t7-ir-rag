# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO COATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Compact and versatile apparatus for deposition of multi layer coatings on substrates at reduced pressure comprises at least 3 and preferably at least 4 evacuable deposition chambers 4, 5, 6, 7 , means P4, P5, P6, P7 for evacuating each of said deposition chambers and coating means 41, 42 in each of said deposition chambers for depositing a coating layer on a substrate an evacuable transfer chamber 2 with closable ports 28 between said transfer chamber and each of said coating chambers for transfer of a substrate to be coated between said deposition chambers means for evacuating said transfer chamber and transfer means 12 for transferring a substrate between said deposition chambers 4, 5, 6, 7 via the transfer chamber 2 . The apparatus is especially useful for the production of photovoltaic cells in which the active layers are formed of amorphous silicon deposited from a glow discharge.
