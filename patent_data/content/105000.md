# CLOSURE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A closure essembly 15 for attaching a fluid dispensing device to a container 16 with a threaded neck 17 . The closure assembly includes a sleeve member 26 received in a closure member which has a top portion and a depending skirt portion with threads to engage the neck portion of the container. In one embodiment the closure has a top portion with a central opening 24 and has a plurality of inwardly extending lugs or fingers 25 extending into the opening. The sleeve member with an upstanding collar 36 is received in the central opening and has a flange portion 27 abutting the underside of the lugs or fingers. The flange portion has a plurality of lug engaging means received between and adapted to engage the lugs or fingers to interlock the closure member and the sleeve member. The resulting closure assembly provides a substantially leakproof closure system which resists backoff in the event that forces are applied to the closure system inadvertently that would tend to loosen the closure from the container neck.
