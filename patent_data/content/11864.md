# Attenuated strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus, method for preparing it and vaccine comprising it.

## Abstract
Feline infectious peritonitis is a disease of members of the genus Felix which is almost invariably fatal, and for which there is currently no vaccine available. Indeed many attempts to isolate and grow the virus have failed. By passaging a virulent isolate of feline infectious peritonitis FIP virus in feline embryonic cell cultures about 100 times an attenuated strain of FIP virus can be produced which stimulates the pro duction of antibody in susceptible animals without causing overt disease. Such an attenuated strain can be formulated into a vaccine for administrative purposes.
