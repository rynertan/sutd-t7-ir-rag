# Structural bearings.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a modular element for a bridge bearing or other structural bearing comprises providing a press having relatively movable upper and lower members 20, 21 , the lower member having one or more upstanding posts or pins 3 positioning on the lower member 20 , successively, one or more rubber sheets 4 , a lower metal plate 5 , one or more rubber sheets 6 , an upper metal plate 7 , and one or more rubber sheets 8 , the one or more posts or pins 3 extending through holes in the metal plates and the rubber sheets and locating the metal plates to prevent lateral movement thereof operating the press to move the upper and lower members 21, 20 together and to subject the rubber sheets to pressure and subjecting the rubber sheets to heat to effect vulcanization of the rubber and to bond the rubber to the metal plates whereby an intermediate layer of rubber is formed be tween the two plates and upper and lower layers of rubber are formed respectively above and below the upper and lower plates, the rubber deforming around the outer edges of the metal plates, whereby the plates become completely encased in rubber at their upper and lower sides and outer edges removing the resulting modular element from the press and inserting a vul canized rubber plug into the or each of the holes left by the one or more posts or pins.
