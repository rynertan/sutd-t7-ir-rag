# Revetment grids and mats.

## Abstract
A cellular precast grid and mat for use as revetment. The grid 1 , which may typically be cast of concrete, is substan tially rectangular, having a flat bottom and, in its middle, two optional vertical openings 8 of rectangular cross section with two inwardly sloping sides. The grid also has two vertical U shaped channels 6 on each longer opposed side and a two tier vertical channel on each shorter opposed side, which vertical channel can accept projecting portions of the shorter side of two like grids positioned in abutting relation ship, thereby permitting arrangement of grids into revetment of abutting staggered interlocking rows of grids. The grids may be individually places with or without interconnecting pins or may be interconnected into mats by passing cables 4 through tunnels 5 passing horizontally through the grids parallel to the longer sides. Since such cables pass through staggered grids, parallel cables running in a single direction effectively interconnect grids into an integral mattress 2 of staggered rows of grids to produce articulatable concrete mat revetment which may be used with or without filter means constructed of natural materials or filter fabric or other flexible liquid permeable membrane.
