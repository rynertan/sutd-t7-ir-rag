# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR DRILL STEM BREAKOUT DURING DRILLING OPERATION

## Abstract
A rotary well drilling system employs a drill string with a drill bit affixed at its lower end for the drilling of a borehole. Drill ing fluid is circulated through the drill string to remove drill cut tings. To break out a section of drill pipe from the drill string, the drill string is raised to a point where the drill string joint to be broken is above the drilling rig floor. Compressed gas is in jected into the drill string to displace the column of drilling fluid a level below such drill string joint. The compressed gas is vented and the drill pipe is broken out of the drill string.
