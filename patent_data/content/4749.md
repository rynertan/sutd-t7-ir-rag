# BAG FOLDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in connection with the folding of bags or sheets made from a flimsy material, comprising a feeding means 15 operable to discharge bags or sheets successively in a feed direction with each bag or sheet having a plurality of corrugated regions having grooves in the feed direction and undulations in a direction transverse to the feed direction. A receiving device 16 receives the bags or sheets from the feeding means. A fence 28 in or adjacent to the receiving device stops the movement of the bags or sheets along the feed direction. In order to retain the stiffening effect of the corrugated regions on the bags or sheets until they are stopped by the fence, the receiving device includes means operable to maintain in each bag or sheet fed thereto at least some of the corrugated regions until the movement of that bag or sheet in the feed direction is stopped by the fence.
