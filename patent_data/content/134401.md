# A METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING THE RESISTANCE TO WEAR AND CHANGES IN APPEARANCE OF CONSTRUCTION UNITS BELONGING TO THE FURNITURE FIELD

## Abstract
By a method of reproducibly testing the resistance to wear and change in appearance as well as the soil resistance of construction units 4 in full size within the furniture field with associated environments, the construction unit 4 or parts thereof in its full construction is positioned secured on the inner side of a rotatable large drum 1 and subjected to stresses from various stress members 5 located in the drum 1 . These stress members are activated by the rotation of the drum. The stress members 5 may for instance be leather balls 5 filled with water or sand and optionally provided with a facing of wearing members 15 of textile materials or another wearing material such as for instance emery cloth, whereafter the number of rotations of the drum are reg istered and compared with changes arising through natural use. An apparatus for the method comprises a rotatable large drum 1 supported on supporting means. The drum com prises means for accurately adjusting the number of rota tions of said drum and a number of securing means 3 located along its inner circumference 9 for the securing of the construction units 4 as well as a number of stress members 5 situated within the drum 1 . In this manner construction units within the furniture field with associated environments can be tested in their normally used assembed state with a construction of several various materials and in full size.
