# Hinge assembly and vehicle including same.

## Abstract
A hinge assembly 10 for pivotally mounting a vehicle engine compartment hood 12 in position over an engine compartment 15 for swinging about a first horizontal axis 22 from a closed to an open position. The hinge assembly includes hinge members 24, 26 connected to the hood 12 and engine compartment 15 respectively. The compartment hinge member 26 includes cam means 36 arranged to be acted upon by a cam follower 54 carried on a force transmitting member 40 pivoted on the compartment hinge member 26 about a second axis 44 spaced from the first axis 22 . A spring 58 maintains the follower 54 in contact with the cam means 36 and applies a swinging force to the hood in opposition to the weight of the hood so that a substantially constant manual effort is required to swing the hood through a substantial part of its swinging movement towards the open position.
