# Apparatus for measuring osmotic pressure in situ.

## Abstract
A multiple lumen Swanz Ganz catheter 10 is disclosed wherein said first 12 and second lumens 14 are connected to an osmotic pressure sensor 44 and a third lumen 24 is connected to a hydrostatic pressure sensor 44 . First and second lumens are fluidly continuous, connected through six hollow fibrils 16 . Pressure in the first and second lumens is added to the pressure of the third lumen to determine colloid osmotic pressure. The fibrils 16 are made of a cellulose acetate material permeable to substances having a molecu lar weight less than 30,000 and filled with nylon filaments. The fibrils are exposed to the bloodstream through a port 22 in the catheter 10 which also provides an external opening for the third lumen. Fluid in the fibrils is pulsed to remove debris from the surfaces of the fibrils 16 . The surfaces of the fibrils are also flushed periodically with physiological saline solution from the third lumen to prevent obstruction The catheter is held in place by a flotation balloon.
