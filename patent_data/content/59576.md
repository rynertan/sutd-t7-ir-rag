# A method of monitoring the closing action of a mould.

## Abstract
A signal is produced which is representative of a position of a part of a mould 1b, 7b, 8b, 9b at a time in a cyclic process of forming glassware when the mould 1, 7, 8, 9 should be closed. This signal is compared with a signal representative of the position of the mould part 1b, 7b, 8b, 9b when the mould is correctly closed. This latter signal is produced by averaging a selected number of the immediate ly preceding signals representative of the position of the part of the mould at the time when the mould should be closed.
