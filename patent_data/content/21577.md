# Electrical switchgear of the rotating arc, double break type.

## Abstract
In a contacts closed position of the switchgear a pair of contact arms 6 and 10 , which are electrically connected to respective conductors 3 and 4 , engage the ends of a main contact bar 17 such that current flow occurs through the switchgear by way of conductor 3 , contact arm 6 , contact bar 17 , contact arm 10 and conductor 4 . Upon movement of the contact bar 17 in the direction of arrow 31 , the contact bar disengages from the contact arms 6 and 10 , and an arc is drawn between each end portion 14 and 16 of the contact arms and a respective arcing electrode 23A, 23B . A common field coil 27 has its ends electrically connected to the arcing electrodes respectively, such that the arcing current flows through the field coil 27 to create a magnetic field which causes the arcs to rotate and become extinguished an insulating barrier 24 separates the electrodes 23A and 23B to prevent the arc from being transferred directly across the contact arms 6 and 10 .
