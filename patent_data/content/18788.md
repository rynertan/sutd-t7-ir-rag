## Description
Apparatus in which a pair of rolls are forced together, and a method of operating the apparatus The present invention relates to pressure roll apparatus, particularly for fixing toner images to copy substrates, and more particularly to apparatus for effecting pressure engagment between a pair of rolls. In the process of xerography, a light image of an original to be copied is typically recorded in the form of a latent electrostatic image upon a photosensitive member with subsequent rendering of the latent image visible by the application of electroscopic marking particles, commonly referred to as toner. The visual toner image can be either fixed directly upon the photosensitive member or transferred from the member to another support, such as a sheet of plain paper, with sub sequel affixing of the image thereto in one of various ways, for example, as by heat and pressure. In order to affix or fuse electroscopic toner material onto a support member by heat and pressure, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky, while simultaneously applying pressure. This action causes the toner to flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of support members or otherwise upon the surfaces thereof. Thereafter, as the toner material cools, solidification of the toner material occurs causing the toner material to be bonded firmly to the support member. In both the xerographic as well as the electrographic recording arts, the use of thermal energy and pressure for fixing toner images onto a support member is old and well known. One approach to heat and pressure fusing of electroscopic toner images onto a support has been to pass the support with the toner images thereon betweena pair of opposed roller members, at least one of which is heated. During operation of a fusing system of this type, the support member to which the toner images are electrostatically adhered is moved through the nip formed between the rolls with the toner image contacting the fuser roll thereby to effect heating of the toner images within the nip. Conventionally one or the other of the rolls is softer than the other so that where the rolls are forced into pressure engagement the softer roll is deformed thereby forming a nip through which the support or copy substrates pass. Formation of the nip enables the toner images to contact the heated surface of the roll for a period of time sufficient to effect fusing. In order to effect pressure engagement of the rolls a force applying mechanism is provided which usually takes the form of a cam and lever arrangement. In some instances the cam has been replaced by a pneumatic actuator as for example, as in U. S. Patent 3 256 002.Such mechanisms yield satisfactory results, but require complex and expensive pressure controls in order to maintain a constant nip pressure, assuming the roll dimensions are exact. Accordingly, it is the purpose of the present invention to incorporate in a heat and pressure roll fusing apparatus, a fluid operated mechanism for effecting pressure engagement of a pair of rolls, which mechanism is substantially insensitive to fluctuations in air pressure and which compensates for roll dimension variations in the same roll as well as between different rolls. To this end, the mechanism contemplated comprises a pair of lever arms which are pivotally suppor ted by a frame means forming a part of the xerographic machine in which the fuser is to be employed. The arms, in turn, support one of the rolls such that when the arms are moved in a predetermined direction the rolls are forced into pressure engagement. A pressure fluid actuator is operatively connected to the pivot arms via an elongated load bar and a compression spring is interposed between each of the actuator arms and the load bar. When air pressure is applied to the diaphragm, the displacement is transmitted first through the load bar then through the compression springs, then the actuator arms and finally to the rolls. Initial setting up of the mechanism requires pressurizing the diaphragm to 30 kN m nd adjusting a pair of stops which limit the travel of the load bar. 2During operation, however, 41 kN m are supplied so that normally expected downward fluctuation of air pressure will not affect the nip pressure, the maximum nip pressure being limited to 30 W 2 due to the position of the adjustable stops. The mechanism disclosed differs from that illustrated in U. S. Patent 3 256 002, in that the structure disclosed in the patent does not incorporate the compression springs. During the initial setup with air at 30 kN m 2 the air system compensates for the manufacturing tolerances in the loading system resulting in the loading bar being not parallel to the roll axis. The loading bar is made to maintain this compensating position by stop screws. After this setup any load change due to roll runouts and diametrical changes is minimized by the presence of compression springs which respond to those changes. A low k load deflection value for the spring would ensure a small change in load. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a roll fuser apparatus including mechanism for effecting pres sure engagement between the two rolls of the apparatus representing the invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken on the line II II of Fig. lo Fig. 3 is a plan view of the apparatus of of Fig. l Fig. 4A is a cross sectional view taken along lines IVA IVA of Fig. 3 Fig. 4B is a cross section along lineZgB 7B of Fig. 3, and Fig. 4C is a view taken along the lines IVC IVC of Fig. 3. As illustrated in Fig. l, the fuser apparatus representing the invention is designated by the reference character 10. The fuser apparatus comprises a heated fuser roll 12 comprising a relatively thick e g 1.75 mm layer of conductive i. e. 15 x l0 4 cal cm. sec oc. silicone rubber 14 adhered to a cylinder 16 fabricated from a thermally conductive material, for example, alum inum and having a wall thickness on the order of 9.5 mm. The fuser roll is preferably 0.4 m long and has a nominal diameter of 76 mm. A conventional type heat source lS Fig. 2 is stationarily supported within the hollow of the cylinder 16 and spaced equidistant from the internal surface thereof. The capacity of the heat source is such that its output equals 1600 watts at 120 volts. The fuser roll is rotatably journalled in a ma chine frame 20, rotation thereof being effected by means of a drive arrangement 22 illustrated in Fig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the drive arrangement 22 comprises a plurality of cylindrical gears 24, 26 and 28. As can be seen,the gear 24 is attached to an end cap 30 forming a part of the fuser roll while the gears 26 and 28 are carried by the machine frame 20. Motive power to the drive arrangement is provided by a drive motor 32 Fig. 2 . A pressure roll 34, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3 is supported for pressure engagement with the fuser roll 12 by means of a pair of pivot arm assemblies 36, 36 which are, in turn, pivotally supported by stub shafts 38,38 carried by the machine frame 20. The pressure roll comprises a rigid core 40 having a relatively thin 41 layer of PFA a trademark of E. I. duPont material adhered to the outer surface thereof, the PFA layer thickness being on the order of tens of microns. The pressure roll structure is thus harder than the fuser roll, therefore, when 1335 N is applied between the rolls, as will be discussed hereinafter, the silicone rubber layer 14 is deformed thereby providing a nip 42 on the order of 4.4 mm. It should be appreciated that alternatively the fuser roll 12 could be supported by the pivot arm assemblies 36, 36 . The ends of the arm assemblies 36, 36 remote from ends supporting the pressure roll are displaced during pressure engagement of the rolls by a pair of compression springs 44, 44 which encircle shoulder screws 46 only one shown and are thereby retained in their operative positions. The spring rate is on the order of 26 N m and the spring, having a free length of 25man, is pre compressed to 21mm. The opposite ends of the springs are operatively connected to an elongated load bar 48 which, in turn, is operatively connected to a diaphragm assembly 50 Figs. l and 3 . The diaphragm assembly 50 Figs. 4A, 4B, 4C comprises an elastomeric member 52 overcoated with a nylon fabric which elastomer is attached to a rigid plate 54. The diaphragm is secured to a base 56 by means of a retaining ring 58, the base being supported by the machine frame 20. An elbow 60, secured to the underside of the base 56 and communicating with a bore 62 provided therein serves as means for introducing air under pressure to the diaphragm assembly to thereby displace the elastomeric member 52 which, in turn, causes displacement of the load bar 48, the displacement being transmitted to the springs 44, 44 , then to the pivot arms assemblies resulting in loading of the pressure roll against the fuser roll. The effective area of the elastomer 52 is 103 cm2 and a desired working pressure has been established as30 kN m 2 2 Consequently, in order to produce a total of 1335 N between the rolls 12 and 34, the pivot arm assemblies 36, 36 are designed to produce a mechanical advantage of 4.32. Roll load set up is accomplished by applying 2 a 30 E m lnading on the diaphragm and adjusting adjus table stops 64 which are secured in the diaphragm support 56 Fig. 3 and extend through apertures 65 Fig. 4B in the load bar 48 such that when adjustment has been made and the stops have been locked in place, the load corresponding to this pressure is maintained when the pressure is increased beyond this value. During operation of the 2 fuser, a pressure of 41 kN m is applied to allow for downward fluctuations in the applied pressure without a corresponding decrease in load between the rolls. As will be appreciated, the compression springs maintain a near constant load for roll dimension variations, either with the same roll or from roll to roll when a new roll is installed for a worn roll. As viewed in Fig 1, bias springs 66 are provided for returning the pressure roll to a non operative position i. e. rolls are out of contact . To this end, the bias springs are attached to the fuser frame and pivot arm assemblies 36, 36 .
