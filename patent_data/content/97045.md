The invention relates to a locking mechanism for locking together overlapping base panels of a wrap around type car ton. The mechanism comprises a locking element 50 pivotally mounted on carton conveying means 10 for movement there with and including a locking finger 60 for insertion into said base panels to form a lock therebetween, a rotatable cam disc 62 for cooperation with a first follower leg 56 provided by the locking element for pivoting the locking finger into a locking position, and a rotatable cam disc 66 for cooperation with a second follower leg 58 provided by the locking element for pivoting the locking finger into a retracted position. The cam discs 62, 66 are located at spaced locations along the path of movement of the locking element for interference therewith such that said second follower leg 58 automatically is brought into a position for engagement with its respective cam disc 66 during cooperation between the first follower leg 56 and its respective cam disc 62 and vice versa, whereby the locking element is pivoted sequentially into its locking re tracted positions.
