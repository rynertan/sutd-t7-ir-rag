# Automatic taker in for double twisting spindles and double twisting spindle equipped with said taker in.

## Abstract
The invention provides an injentor 39 having a suitably formed head 32 which can partially penetrate through a lateral aperture in a spindle 10 into the vicinity of chamber 27 containing the expansible olive 16 . Penetrating into chamber 27 , said injector 31 laterally displaces the olive 16 and by injecting through the beak 33 a fluid under pressure creates in the axial passage a negative positive pressure necessary for trasporting the fila ment 17 . In the vicinity of chamber 27 there can advantageously be provided a mobile section 28 which is circumferentially displaceable by means 42 which is included on the head 32 of injector 31 , when said injector 31 penetrates or is pene trating the spindle 10 . The injector 31 is further provided with an arm 38 which may be pivoted in the vicinity of the balloon container 19 or on an auxiliary bench 40 .
