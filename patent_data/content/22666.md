# Pesticide compositions which contain a surface active agent and method of applying them to plants.

## Abstract
The effect of certain agricultural chemicals is improved by co administration of them with one or more additives that modify the uptake of the chemical by modifying physico chemical properties of the leaf or that alter the physical relationship between the agricultural chemical and the leaf surface such that the uptake of the agricultural chemical is altered beneficially, e.g. by temporarily holding the agricultural chemical in a layer on the leaf surface during a period when it is not needed by the plant. Compositions contain one or more of the agricultural chemicals and one or more of the additives, and the harvest of a given crop can be improved by applying it to one or more of the agricultural chemicals and one or more of the additives simultaneously or within up to 15 days of one another. The compositions may be made up with purgatives or emetics to reduce toxicity.

## Description
ENGINEERING 1PROVED C4I CAL PERFORMANCE IN PLANTS This invention relates to agricultural chemicals, which term is used herein to mean fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides and plant growth regulators, and to methods of using them and compositions containing them. The present invention is concerned with altering the performance of such chemicals. Conventional approach to this involves altering the chemical structure to a greater or lesser degree without altering the class or basic chemical type tb which the compound belongs, and or altering the physicochemical properties of the formulation containing the chemical, e.g. by the addition of chemicals to stick the agricultural chemical to the target organism or to improve the rainfastness of the agricultural chemical. The literature including patents is full of examples of how the conventional approach may be carried out.In particular it is known that addition of one or more wetting agents also called surfactants or surfaceactive agents can enhance the effect of many agricultural chemicals when used at rates that lower the surface tension of the spray solution and enable it to spread more effectively over leaf surfaces particularly where these are waxy . In addition, within the patent literature there are reports of encapsulated agricultural chemicals that slowly release their contents. This invention is based on the discovery that the efficiency of agricultural chemicals, especially the growth regulator Chlormequat chlorocholine chloride can be markedly improved by the use of surfactants at levels far higher than are required to reduce surface tension as hereinbefore described, and or by the use of a coating agent as hereinafter defined.In International Patent Application No. PCT GB 79 00050, the use of Chlormequat in association with certain metabolic additives is described for purposes including 1 in Zea Relays SEize , increase in yield 2 in Oil Seed Rape, the increase in yield and control of lodging 3 in Sugar Beet, increase in the proportion of sugar within the beet and in the yield of roots, and control of bolting early seed production 4 in Potatoes, increase in yield, uniformity of tuber size and increase in the strength of tuber attachment to the plant to facilitate harvesting 5 in Carrots, Radishes, Turnips and Swedes, increase in yield and uniformity of root size 6 in Beans dry and green runner and other Pulses increase in yield. Chlormequat, in combination with the additives described in Application No. PCT GB 79 0050, is applied as a spray solution using typically 45 112.5 litres of water per hectare where the application is from the air or from a controlled droplet applicator and at 157.5 1125 litres per hectare from conventional sprayers. The application time may be from shortly after crop emergence to some two weeks before harvesting. In root crops a preferred time would be at or shortly before the commencement of tuber initiation potato or root swelling other root crops . In cereals the preferred time is from crop emergence until the emergence of the ear. At high levels surfactants may physically modify the structure of the outer walls of plant cells and leaf surfaces and hence physically modify the structure of a plant leaf such that an agricultural chemical may penetrate it better. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to the following 1 condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol and octylcresol 2 partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides 3 condensation products of such partial esters 2 with ethylene oxide 4 Lecithins 5 sodium and calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulpbonic acids 6 fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol and condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide 7 quaternary salts and condensates of ethylene oxide with amines s substances sold under the Trade Marks Etho3 leen, Ethoduomeen, Duoquod, Arquad, Lissapol, Cirrasol, Tween 20, Triton X 100, Citowett and Agral 9 tall oil and 10 substances sold under the trivial chemical nuzzles sodium lauryl sulphate, amine salts of sulphated fatt alcohols, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide condensate, alkylated aromatic sodium sulphonate, and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate. The concentration of such surfactants in the final spray solutions applied in conventional practice to plants is from 0.01 to 0.025 for crops not possessing a .aH surface, e.g.cereals, and up to 0.054 for crops possessing a waxy surface, e.g. Prussel sprouts. Such solutions have been considered to give maxiLlum benefit in farm use. then proceeding in accordance with the present invention, the final concentration in the applied solution is from 0.075 to ,a, preferably 0.75 to 2.5 . The above concentrations are w v for solid surfactants and v v for liquid surfactants. The addition of a coating agent to an agricultural chemical, whether or not a surfactant is added, can be beneficial for a number of reasons. Thus, certain plant growth regulators, e.g. chlormequat chlorocholine chloride , mepiquat chloride and ethopon, and certain herbicides, e.g. glyphosate, which are water soluble and cannot bind to the leaf surface before uptake, may be washed from the leaf by rain before they become effective. To delay application of the chemical because of showery conditions may mean that good growing conditions, under which such chemicals are most effective, no longer exist and the crop cannot therefore be usefully treated. Mpreover, many fungi, such as the causal organism of eyespot disease, grow better under showery conditions, which tend to wash off any applied fungicide.It is therefore particularly valuable to be able to incorporate into a pesticide formulation or to use in a tank mixture with it agricultural chemicals normally being applied in a large volume of water a coating agent, i.e. a chemical that seals it to the leaf and makes the chemical resistant to rain or artificial irrigation. This can make it possible to apply chlormequat or mepiquat chloride to cereal crops in autumn, when it is more effective than in spring, when it is normally applied. Furthermore, by using a coating agent, two or more chemicals may be usefully applied at the appropriate time for the earliest of the group while the activity is maintained in those required later until such times as it is required. For example it may be required to apply a herbicide before a fungicide application is economically desirable. By use of a coating as hereinbefore described both may be applied at the same time with considerable saving in costs. Among coating agents that can be used in accordance with the present invention, either as such or in solution or emulsion, are the following 1 di l p menthene a terpene sold under the trade names of Miller Gard, Vapor Gard and stiller Aide , which is especially preferred 2 acrylic polymers and copolymers, e.g. polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile, poly methyl methacrylate and poly ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate 3 cellulose ethers, e.g. hydroxethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 4 cellulose esters, e.g. methyl cellulose 5 epoxy resins, e.g. those sold under the Trade Marks Epikote 205, Epikote 828 and Eipkote 1001 6 hydrocarbon resins, e.g. petroleum resins, such as Hercules A 100 7 polyester resins 8 polyether resins 9 polyamide resins 10 rubbers, e.g. natural rubber, polyurethane, butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, polychloroprene and rubber oil emuline il silicone resins and polymers 12 styrene polymers, e.g. polystyrene and styrene butadiene copolymer 13 thermosetting polymers, e.g. melamine formaldehyde copolymer, phenol formaldehyde resins and urea formaldehyde resins 1 vinyl polymers, e.g. polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly vinylacetate vinyl chloride and poly vinyl acetate acrylate and 15 natural drying oils, with or without metal accelerators, e.g. linseed and linseed tung oils and linoleic and lino linic acids. These coating agents are applied in from 2 10 gallons per acre 22.5 112.5 litres per hectare of water using aerial application or controlled droplet application and from 10 500 gallons per acre 112.5 5625 litres per hectare using conventional ground spray equipment. The application rate is from 250 ml to 62 litres of the coating agent per sprayed hectare of crop. Two or more such coating agents in the same or different classes may be used together. This invention provides an agricultural formulation comprising an agricultural chemical as hereinbefore defined together with a surfactant in a quantity such that the amount is at least 0.0759o in a solution containing the agricultural chemical ready for application to plants, and or a coating agent of the type described. Such formulations may be in concentrate form, needing addition of, for example, water to make them ready for use. This invention also provides a method of applying an agricultural chemical to a target plant, in which a surfactant in the above mentioned quantity and or coating agent of the type herein described is also applied either simultaneously with the agricultural chemical or not more than fifteen days preferably 10 days before or after.Separate application of coating agent and agricultural chemical can reduce the tendency of certain chemicals to have their effectiveness reduced by their being bound strongly to the coating agent, while sealing them usefully to the plant. Additionally the coating can form a dividing layer between products that, if used in combination, including their spraying within 2 3 weeks of one another, could react together either to reduce activity or to damage the crop, e.g. difenzoquat and MCPA not ester formulated . This technique may also be used to seal to the leaf a chemical that it is desired will pentrate the plant, such as a growth regulator or systemic fungicide, while keeping away from the leaf surface another chemical that it is desired to keep out of the leaf since its penetration would rapidly degrade the chemical to non effective or even cropdamaging products or would reduce its effectiveness by removing it from the leaf surface when that is the area where its presence is required. IÃhen the application is simultaneous, the agricultural chemical and the surfactant and or coating agent may be supplied in a single formulation or may be mixed in situ in a spray or other chemical applying apparatus. The surfactants and or coating agents are herein referred to as Additives. The use of compositions in accordance with the present invention can enhance the effectiveness of chlormequat also called chlorocholinc chloride, ss chloroetllJrl trimethylanmnonium chloride and CCC as mentioned above. Such compositions may also be beneficially used with other plant growth regulators including auxins, gibberellins and ethephon and mixtures of these. The use of high level of surfactants and or coating agents in accordance with this invention has a very general property on the uptake of agricultural chemicals by plant leaves, such that the activity of a wide range of agricultural chemicals may be beneficially enhanced, in the case of surfactants by a greater amount than would be expected from their use for reducing surface tension alone, especially at temperatures below 100C. A further aspect of this invention is the use of the surfactants in conjunction with the coating agents to produce a further enhancement of activity. Although it is beneficial for a surfactant to be used with a coating agent, such coating agents may be used alone to hold an agricultural chemical onto the leaf of a crop plant during a period when there is no growth and or necessity for the chemical. An example of such a period would be during the months of December and January in the U. K. where there is little plant growth and fungal diseases are not developing. Thus a growth regulator as hereinbefore described and or a fungicide may be applied in combination with a coating agent or the said coating agent may be applied to the plant within fifteen days of the application of the agricultural chemical. On the return ofSpring when the plant may beneficially use a growth regulator and or the action of a fungicide against fungal disease becomes of importance, increasing air temperatures and or increasing solar radiation break don the coating agent to free the trapped agricultural chemical. At this point in the utilisation of the agricultural chemical by the crop the presence of a surfactant contained also within the coating is especially beneficial it can assist in the uptake of an agricultural chemical with less phytotoxicity crop damage . Such phytoxicity could be increased in certain circumstances such as high temperatures by the wetting agent surfactant combined only with the agri cultural chemical .The use of a coating agent to preserve an agricultural chemical in position during what is effectively a dormant period,and its subsequent release with the return of growing conditions, is a novel and hitherto unexpected feature of such coating processes and is totally different from previously reported encapsulated materials. In addition the coating agent may, either in combination with an agricultural chemical or when applied by itself, place a protective seal or layer over the crop plant such that it would be protected from a spray treatment with a late applied agricultural chemical capable of damaging it. Thus a crop could be coated before the emergence of certain weeds which could later be sprayed with a herbicide that would, without the previously applied coating, be damaging to the crop. The coating agent may also serve to reduce loss of water by transpiration and thus check wilting, and prevent frost damage, thus avoiding possible physiological or other damage to the crop that makes it more susceptible to attack by fungi and or insect pests. A synergistic effect may therefore be obtained through the use of the coating agent and a fungicide and or insecticide. The action of agricultural chemicals including growth regulators can be reduced by wilting, since wilted leaves take up chemicals poorly, and by frost damage. A wilted leaf may additionally present a poorer target for a spray since it will tend to hang downwards. Thus a beneficial combination of chemical and coating agent possibly applied before the chemical may be obtained. Use of a coating agent may also reduce the accuracy in a necessary timing of application. As is known, application of certain agricultural chemicals such as growth regulators require application to be made at a precise stage of crop development.This stage may be short lived and difficult for the farmer to identify even if it is identified correctly, the weather may prevent a timely application. The use of the coating agent may enable the product to go on more conveniently during a relatively lengthy period before the time at which the chemical would otherwise have required application. In yet another aspect the coating agent hereinbefore described may be used either in combination with or applied after an application of an insecticide to reduce the hazard to beneficial insects such as bees and ladybirds that may alight on leaf surfaces but which do not eat leaf material. All the surfactants can act as purgative agents and thus reduce the mammalian toxicity of an agricultural chemical with which they are formulated or with which a formulation containing these additives is mixed in the spray tank or before adding to the spray tank. This decrease in mammalian toxicity may be further enhanced by the addition of knows purgatives and or emetics including phenolphthalein, castor oil, ipecachuana and apomorphine. It is known that an increase in the seeding rate of wheat, barley or oats of above some 1,000 seeds per sq. metre fails to increase the yield and at about this planting density yield per acre begins to become reduced. At 2,000 seeds per square metre this reduction is usually very marked. Although there are more ears, the average size of the ear is reduced by a greater factor at high planting densities. This reduction cannot be corrected by the addition of nutrients and or irrigation water to the crop. For this reason barley, wheat and oats are normally planted at around 1 1 h cwt of seed per acre 155 kg per hectare with a variation on this of some tO ,o up or don. The problem is seen as being a light related one.However, the failure to produce a full sized or approaching a full sized ear is not simply a matter of the reduction in the total light energy available to the plants. The problem is related in substantial measure to the quality of light reachin the plants. The crop canopy screens off a very high proportion of light at the red end of the spectrum while allowing light at the far red end of the spectrum to pass through. Thus the more open less densely planted the crop is, the higher will be the ratio of far red to red light that falls over the total leaf surface. This ratio affects the phytochrome systems of the plant which in turn determine the level of activity of hormones such as gibberellic acid. This will determine in large measure the size of the ear.By blocking the action of hormones capable of effecting this reduction, as for example gibberellic acid, ear size can be increased at high planting densities and the field more fully utilised including by the use of a broadcast crop. Thus grain production per acre may be increased. For this purpose an application of chlormequat formulated with the combination of additives as disclosed in PCTApplication PCT GB 79 00050 of from 0.25 to 5.0 kg. per hectare may be applied using up to 12,000 litres per hectare of water as a diluent. Such volume of water may be required to ensure penetration of the densely planted crop. Further improvement can be made by including a coating agent in the formulation, as in the present invention. Other chemicals may be used for this purpose, including 1. Quaternary ammonium compounds of the formula R,N C 3 Y in which Y is a non phytotoxic anion and R is a lower aliphatic radical e.g. a C18 or Cl6 aliphatic radical containing a non ionizing nucleophilic group or atom, e.g. haloalkyl, alkyl ene, haloalkylene, cyanoalkyl, mercaptoalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl or epithioalkyl. Such compounds are defined in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 3 156 554 and a specific example of such a compound is chlorocholine chloride, which is mentioned above.2. Haloalkyl phosphonic acids particularly ss haloalkyl phosphoric acids and especially acids in which the halogen is chlorine and compounds of the general formulaEMI10.1 where each of R, RI and R2 which are identical or different, is a hydrogen atom or a C 1 3 alkyl radical. Examples of non phytotoxic anions are chloride, bromide, methosulphate, sulphate and phosphate. A particularly useful example is 2 chloroethyl phosphonic acid CEPA . Such compounds are defined in detail in U.K. Patent No. 1 483 915.3. Chlorphonium chloride, i.e. tributyl 2,4 dichloro benzyl phosphonium chloride.4. Mepiquat chloride.5. A diphenyl 1H pyrazolium salt of the formulaEMI11.1 where R1 is methyl R2 is C1 C4 alkyl X is an anion with a charge of 1 to 3 Y, Y , Z and Z are hydrogen, halogen, methyl or methoxy and m is an integer from 1 to 3 pro vided that only one phenyl ring can be substituted on the carbon para to the pyrazolium ring with a sulzstituent other than hydrogen. These compounds are defined in detail in U.K. Patent No. 1 466 634. The use of such growth regulatory compounds as herein before described 1 5 inclusive may be particularly benefitted by their use in conjunction with those metabolic additives and combinations of additives as described in my prior InternationalPatent Application No. PCT GB 79 00050. Of special importance is the ability of these additives as claimed in PCT GB 79 00050 to improve the efficacy of a fungicide applied in combination with or up to 2 to 3 weeks before or after their application. This is because fungal disease is both more likely and when occurring more severe in densely planted crops than in those that are thinly planted. The further addition of the coating agents has hereinbefore described either with or without the metabolic additives described in PCT GB 79 00050 may be beneficial in combination with those products hereinbefore described as possessing growth regulatory properties. Because of crop density, there can be considerable problems with adequate spray penetration as seeding rate is increased beyond the normal. This may be overcome by the use of the coating agents and and or wetting agents as hereinbefore described at higher than normal levels. By acting beneficially the hormone systems produced under dense planting conditions it becomes possible to usefully increase the seeding planting rate of wheat, barley or oats beyond the 1 3 4 cwt per acre 215 220 kg per hectare normal planting rate up to 4 5 cwt per acre 500 625 kg per hectare and in addition to usefully broadcast such high seed rates rather than to plant them in discreet drills which better allow light penetration than does broadcasting a crop. This invention is not confined to wheat, oats and barley but may similarly be applied to all small grain cereals such as rice, rye, millet and sorghum, as well as to maize.
