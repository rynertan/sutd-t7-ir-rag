## Description
EXPANDED THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR PREPARING AN EXPANDED ARTICLE THEREFROM This invention relates to an expandable thermoplastic composition, a method of making an expanded thermoplastic composition, and an expanded article produced by such method. The invention is based on the discovery that unexpected and significant advantages flow from employing, as an expandable EMT elastomer modified thermoplastic , a composition comprising a blend of A a previously partially crosslinked TPE thermoplas tic elastomer comprising a 50 to 90 percent by weight of ethylene propyl ene elastomer, and b 50 to 10 percent by weight of poly alpha olefin resin B additional crystalline poly alpha olefin resin, added subsequently to the partial cross linking of A , to establish an overall resin elastomer ratio of 99 5 to 55 45 by weight and C a blowing agent in an amount sufficient to expand the blend of A plus B . It will be understood that in the practice of the invention the additional poly alpha olefin resin B is added subsequently to the partial cross linking of A , that is, B is added subsequently to and separately from the step of partially cross linking the ethylenepropylene rubber poly alpha olefin blend l a plus b blend to prepare the thermoplastic elastomer A . The method of the invention comprises submitting the described mixture to conditions causing the blowing agent C to expand the blend. Various advantages of the invention become evident upon comparing, for example, injected molded foam based on the abovedescribed blend of A , B and C , with injection molded foam based on a mechanical blend of ethylene propylene rubber with poly alpha olefin resin which has not been partially cross linked and which contains the same over all resin rubber ratio .Similarly, diverse advantages of the invention become manifest upon comparing the invention with injection molded foam based on a blend of ethylene propylene rubber with poly alpha olefin resin same over all resin rubber ratio which has been partially cross linked in toto. Thus, as indicated, in the invention composition a TPE A based on a partially cross linked blend of a ethylene propylene rubber and b poly alpha olefin resin having less than the finally desired resin content is subsequently blended, after the partial cross linking step, with B additional poly alpha olefin resin to bring the over all resin content up to the level desired in the finalEMT elastomer modified thermoplastic .This makes possible the following surprising advantages compared to a mechanical uncrosslinked blend of ethylene propylene rubber and poly alpha olefin resin Significantly more weight reduction and uniformity More uniform cell structure and skin thickness Improved surface smoothness Reduction in surface imperfections such as splay marks Improved dimensional stability no post blow Better shot to shot reproducibility Shorter cycle times especially when producing large and or geometrically complex parts. Furthermore, the invention makes possible the following advantages over partially cross linked blend of ethylene propylene rubber and poly alpha olefin resin having the same overall resin rubber ratio Essentially no odor Significantly better surface smoothness Reduction in surface imperfections Greater weight reduction No mold residue More uniform cell structure and skin thickness Significantly better fill of the mold, and shot to shot unifor mity Improved dimensional stability no post blow . The thermoplastic elastomer A employed in the invention is a conventional material, made for example as described in U.S. patents 3,758,643, Fischer, Sept. 11,1973, 3,806,558, Fischer, April 23, 1974, or 4,031,169, Morris, June 21 1977, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such a TPE A may be described as a blend of a mono olefin copolymer elastomer with b poly alpha olefin resin which has been partially cross linked with the aid of a curing agent such as a peroxide, typically in a dynamic partial curing operation the cross linking is carried out only to an extent that will not prevent the material becoming knit together into a coherent mass when processed on conventional rubber or plastic processing machinery.The mono olefin copolymer rubber a is typically either an ethylene propylene copolymer or an ethylene propylene non conjugated diene terpolymer made, for example, from such non conjugated dienes as dicyclopentadiene, 5. ethylidene 2 norbornene, 1 ,4 hexadiene, etc. . The resin b is usually polyethylene or polypropylene. Likewise, the additional poly alpha olefin resin B is ordinarily polyethylene or polypropylene. Blowing agents C suitable for carrying out the invention include physical and chemical blowing agents, and they may be solid, liquid or gaseous substances. Physical blowing agents include volatile liquids such as pentane, hexane, methylene chloride and trichlorofluoromethane, and gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Chemical blowing agents are usually solids which, when heated to a specific temperature, decompose producing a large amount of gaseous products such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and a solid residue. Well known chemical blowing agents are sodium bicarbonate, p,p oxybis benzenesulfonyl hydrazide , azodicarbonamide, p toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide, 5 phenyltetrazole, trihydrazine triazine. To these chemical blowing agents may be added activators and nucleating agents, as is well known in the art. There is a great variety of articles that may be manufactured using the composition of this invention such as refrigerator doors, automotive body parts, containers, panelling, furniture, packaging, battery cases, wind deflectors, aircraft interior members and others. To make such articles, the composition of the invention is prepared, and typically introduced into an appropriate mold of the desired size and shape. When the composition is heated, the blowing agent causes the heat softened material to expand and fill the mold, thus forming a famed or cellular article of the desired size and shape. The following examples, in which all quantities are expressed by weight unless otherwise indicated, will serve to illustrate the practice of the invention in more detail. Example I Blends having the composition indicated in Table I may be prepared, using the following ingredients EPDM rubbery terpolymer containing 50 ethylene, 45 propylene and 5 dicyclopentadiene, having a Mooney viscosity ML 4 of 60 at 1250. PP polypropylene melt flow index 4. SMB stabilizer master batch containing 15 parts tetrakis methylene 3 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxylphenyl propionate methane, 60 parts dilaurylthio dipropionate, 25 parts 2 3 ,5 di t butyl 2 didroxphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole, and 20 parts magnesium oxide. PO curative, dicumylperoxide. BA blowing agent, azodicarbonamide. TPE partially cured thermoplastic elastomer may be prepared according to the method disclosed in U.S. patent 3,806,558 using 60 parts of the EPDM, 40 parts of the PP and 0.7 parts of PO. ThisTPE may be stabilized with 1.2 parts of SMB stabilizer master batch. The TPE has a gel content of about 80 percent when measured by immersion in cyclohexane for 48 hours at 720F, and exhibits these physical properties Tensile strenght, 1100 psi elongation, 480 Shore D Hardness, 39. Run 1 in Table I may be carried out in the following manner EPDM bale rubber, diced PP and the SMB are blended together in an internal Banbury trademark mixer in the absence of curatives for 10 minutes at a temperature of from 330 to 3500F 165 1700C .The resilitant blend is sheeted and diced. Subsequently, blowing agent is dry tumble blended with the blend and injection molded, using a No. 1 Negri Bossi trademark injection molding machine at these temperatures front 4400F 2270C , center 4400F and rear 4400F. The 4.5 x 4.5 x 0.375 inch 11.43 x 11.43 x 0.95 cm mold is kept at 700F 210 C . Time for injection is 8 seconds at a 300 psi 2100 kPa pressure, after which the blend remains in the mold for 2.25 minutes, then the mold is opened and the molded article removed. Runs 2 and 4 are conducted in essentially the same fashion asRun 1 except peroxide and sulfur curatives in the amounts indicated in Table I are added to the EPDM and PP when mixing in the internal mixer. Runs 3 and 5 are carried out as follows dicedTPE, diced PP and blowing agent are thoroughly dry tumbleblended, and the mixture injection molded under the conditions outlined above. Runs 1, 2 and 4 are outside the invention Runs 2 and 4 are essentially partially cured according to the teaching of Example 1 ofGerman patent publication Offenlegungsschrift No. 1,544,684.September 18, 1969 Runs 3 and 5 represent the practice of the invention. The results shown in Table I call for the following observations Comparison of Run 3 this invention vs. Run 1 non cured example Run 3 exhibits greater ease of expansion and sample uniformity, no post expansion, improved cell structure, essentially no splay marks and improved surface texture. Comparison of Run 3 this invention vs. Run 2 partially cured comparison Run 3 shows these improvements mold completely filled, no buildup of mold residue, much more uniform cell structure, no discoloration, no odor, much smoother surface texture and essentially no splay marks Comparison of Run 5 this invention vs. Run 4 partially cured comparison The improvements of Run 5 over Run 4 indicate substantially the same trend as Run 3 over Run 2. In summary, the results clearly indicate the superior advantages obtained from blends of this invention over those prepared by other methods.
