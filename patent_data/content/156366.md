# Buried contact solar cell.

## Abstract
An electrical contact formed in a groove in the surface of a semiconductor material facilitates an advantageous con tact with the material for a given cross sectional area of con tact when compared with a contact of the same cross sectional area formed on the surface of the material. The grooved contact significantly reduces shading of the surface of the semiconductor material compared with an equivalent surface contact.
