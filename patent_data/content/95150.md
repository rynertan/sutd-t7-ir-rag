# IMPROVED MULTILAYER POLYAMIDE FILM

## Abstract
Multilayer films comprising a barrier layer of a polyamide polymer, an outer layer of an olefin polymer and an intermediate adhesive layer of a carboxyl modified ethylenic polymer are provided improved processabilitv and improved interlayer adhesion by incorporating a carboxyl modified ethylenic polymer into said polyamide barrier layer. Surprisingly, substantial proportions e.g., up to about 40 weight percent based upon the weight of said barrier layer of the carboxyl modified ethylenic polymer can be incorporated into said polyamide polymer barrier layer without significantly reducing the oxygen barrier properties thereof.
