# Slide fastener stringer.

## Abstract
A coupling element 14 of a slide fastener stringer 10 has a pair of integral upper and lower coupling portions 21, 22 having different shapes and engagable with the lower and upper coupling portions 22, 21 of adjacent coupling elements 14, 14 on a cooperating like stringer 10 . The upper coulping portion 21 having a side surface including a flat abutment surface 28 extending perpendicularly to a stringer tape 11 across the thickness of a longitudinal edge portion 12 of the stringer tape 11 . When lateral pulling forces are applied to the coupled stringers 10, 10 , the abutment surfaces 28 of the interdigitating coupling ele ments 14, 14 take up such forces and prevent the stringers 10, 10 from separation.
