## Description
ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF URINE ARABINONUCLEOSIDES This invention relates to a process for preparing purine arabinonucleosides and more particularly, relates to a novel process for the enzymatic synthesis of the arabinonucleosides of purine and substituted purine derivatives. The arabinonucleosides of purines, especially those of adenine and 2,6 diaminopurine, are useful and valuable as antiviral agents, but means hitherto known for their produc tion have involved either somewhat complex chemical processes or difficult fermentation procedures. Although the production of ribonucleosides and 2 deoxyribonucleosides of certain purines and purine analogues from naturally occurring purine nucleosides, purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleosides, and Fyrimidine nucleotides have been described Imada and Igarasi, Ann.Rep. Takeda Res., 1966, 25 Krenitsky et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1967, 242, 2675 Sivadjian et al., Physiol. eg., 1969, 7, 31 Kaminura et al., Agr. Biol. Chem., 1973, 37, 2063, Holquin et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1975, 54, 515 Stout et al., methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry, Whistler and Miller, Eds. Vt SVII, p. 19, Academic Press, N.Y., 1976 U.S. Patents No. 3,269, and No. 3,135,666 , no such enzymatic synthesis of purine arabinonucleosides ha8 been reported. Furthermore, it has been reported that one of the enzymes used . the present invention, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, ts not capable of utilising arabinonucleosides as substrates Doskocil and Holy, ColT Czechoslov. Chem. Commun., 1977, 42, 370 . According to tbe present invention, there is provided a process for producing 9 B ii arabinonuclesides of purines which comprises reacting a puring base of formula I EMI2.1 wherein a R2 is a hydrogen atom or an amino group and R6 is a hydrogen or halogen atom or a hydroxyl, mercapto, arno, alkoxyl, alkylthio, aryl lower alkylthio or an alkylamino group or b R is a flourine atom and R6 is an amino group or c R2 is a methylamino group and R6 is an amino or methylamino group with arabinose l phosphate, in the presence of an arabinosyl transferring enzyme system of the phosphory lase type, and recovering the purine arabinonucleoside of formula II thus produced, EMI3.1 wherein R2 and R6 are as hereinbefore defined, from the reaction medium. As used herein the term alkyl is denoted to mean an alkyl group having one to twelve carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain. The term lower alkyl is defined as an alkyl group having one to seven carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain. A particular advantage of the above enzymatic synthesis is that whilst traditional methods employed in organic chemistry for making these compounds often yield products of humans etc., or may be administered orally in a tablet at a dosage of 1 to lOOmglkg of mammal body weight. The antiviral activity of the arabinonucleosides of adenine and hypoxanthine R2 H, R6 NH2 or OH in formulaII has been documented in the literature F.M. Schabel, Jr.,Chemotherapy, 13,.321 1968 . The activity of several disubstituted purine arabinosides where R2 NH2 R6 NH2, OH, NHCH3, or SH and where R2 NHCH3, R6 NH2 or NHCH3 has also been reported G.B. Elion, et. al., Ann. . N.Y. Acad. Sci., 255, 468 1975 . Some purine arabinosides of formula II have been rep orted as antitumor agents, e.g., where R2 H and R6 NH2, NHCH3 or SH J.J. Brink and G.A. LePage, Fed. Proc., 22, 184 1963 J.J. Brink and G.A. LePage, Can. J. Biochem.Physio., 43, 1 1965 A.r. Kimball, et al., Can. J. Biochem.Physiol., 42, 1753 1964 and where R2 F, R6 NH2 R,. Brockman, et al., The Pharmacologist, 19, 208 1977 . Furthermore, some of the purine arabinosides of formula II are useful as chemical intermediates, for example, R2 H, R6 Cl was reacted with a variety of nucleophilies in order to prepare other purine arabinosides where R2 H R6 OCH3, NHCH3, NHOH or N CH3 2 and where R2 H R6 SH the compound was methylated or reacted with chlorine gas to give R2 H and R6 SCH3 and C1, respectively. E.J. Reist, et al, J. Org. Chem., 27, 3274 1962 .When R2 H or NH2 and R6 SH, the compounds can be reacted with alkyl halides to give R2 H or NH2 R6 alkylthio which can be reacted with nucleophilic reagents such as metal alkoxides and amines. When R2 Hg or NH2 and R6 SH the compounds can be reacted with 6 alkylhalides and aryl lower alkyl halides to give the corresponding 6 alkylthio or aryl lower alkylthio compouns which can be reacted with nucleophilic reagents such as metal alkoxides and amines. When R2 H or NH2 and R6. r SH alkylthio,aryl lower alkylthio, the compounds can be reacted with reagents such as chlorine gas or hydrogen peroxide followed by reaction with a nucleophile in order to prepare a variety of compounds which are antiviral agents.The.compounds of formula II wherein R6 SR, alkylthio or. aryl lower alkylthio and R2 H or NH2 may be dethiolated with Raney nickel in water or ethanol at reflux temperature to produce t se useful antiviral compounds of formula II where R2 a H or NH2 and R6 a H as is conventional in H or the art. When R2 NH 2 and R6 halogen, the halogen can ba displaced by nucleophiles or hydrolysed in order to prepare active agents. Although the arabinose l phosphate may be provided by synthetic processes known in themselves in the literature Wright, R.S. nd Khorana, H.G., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 80, 1954 1958 , it cai be convenient or even advantageous if the same is generated enzymatically in siru from an arabinosyl donor and an inorganic phosphate to obtain the required arabinose l phosl te. Although the reactions may be carried out separately that is, by isolating the arabinose l phosphate fros an enzymatic reaction or chemically synthesizing arab in ose l phosphate and using it as a starting Material, it has been found advantageous to carry out both reactions in a one pot process by forming the arabinose l phosphate interiediate in situ. The net effect of the coupled reactions therefore is the transfer of the arabinosyl piety of the donor arabinonucleoside to the free purine base, thereby producing the desired arabinonucleoside. The arabinosyl group donor My be a parinze arabino nucleoside for example, adenine arabinonucleoside a pyrimidine arabinonucleoside for example, uracil arabinonucleoside see Examples II, III, , a six both typos, or even a mixture of ture of various arobinonucleosides and non nucleoside material. However, for the purposes of the present invention it is pref erable that the arabnosyl group donor is substantially free from non nucleoside material and also that it is a pyrimidine arabinonucleoside. The reasons for the preference for the use of a pyrimidine arabinonucleoside as the donor are two fold. Firstly, the propercies of the donor arabinonucleoside are sufficiently different from those of the desired product to facilitate easy purification. Secondly, the donor base liberated during the course of the reaction is a pyrimidine rather than a purine which results in substantially less competition between the donor base and the acceptor base for the catalytic site on the enzyme directly involved in product synthesis purine nucleoside phorphorylase . The pyrimidine arabinonucleoside donors may be prepared by any of themethodsknown in the art, for instance, according to the procedure described by Nishimura and Shimizu, Chem.Pharm. Bull Tokyo , 1965, 13, 803. Purine arabinonucleoside donors may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art, for instance, according to the procedures described byRist et al., J. Org. Chem., 1962, 27, 3274. It has been found that both reactions described hereinabove are catalysed by various enzymes which are present in many different microorganisms and mammalian tissues. The phosphorolysis of the donor arabinonucleoside is catalysed, for instance, by purine nucleoside phorphorylase if the donor is a purine arabinonucleoside, or by pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase, thymidine phosphorylase or uridine phosphorylase if the donor is a pyrimidine arabinonucleoside. The second reaction by which the desired purine arabinonucleoside is synthesised from the free base of formula I and arabinose lphosphate is catalysed by purine .lucleoside phosphorylase. The required arabinosyl transferring enzyme system therefore may consist of the latter phosphorylase alone, or in combination with any one of the former type, if the arabinosyl donor is an arabinonucleoside of a pyrimidine or pyrimidine analogue. As previously stated, it has been found that the enzymes required for the catalysis of the reactions employed in the process of the present invention occur in many different microorganisms as well as mammalian tissues. For the purposes of the present invention, however, aerobic bacteria such asB. otesrothenaophilus and especially E. coli B, which is freely available from the American type culture collection under deposition No. ATCC 11303, were found to be excellent sources of such enzymes. The bacteria which provide the enzymes may be cultured under a variety of conditions. with E. coli B Hqwever F edia which contained large quantities of glucose were found to be undesirable since the levels of the nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes in the bacterial cells were depressed in the presence of glucose. It has been found that crude enzyme preparations are less suitable than purified preparations. This is due to the fact that crude preparations contain troublesome nucleic acids s well as enzymes other than those required for the process of the present invention. The extraneous enzymes in crude prep orations catalyse undesirable alterations of substrates and products, and may even cause proteolysis of the required enzymes themselves. These factors decrease not only the yield of the desired products but also the ease with which they can be isolated from reaction mixture6. in most cases therefore, it is desirable to purify the crude enzyme preparations before addition to the reaction mixture. This My be achieved in a number of ways known in themselr2s in the art. For instance, the desired enymesmay be separated or concentrated from extracts of the cells by a combination of treatment with calcium phosphate gel and ion exchange chromatography. Alternatively the cell extract may be treated with streptomycin or nuclease DNA ase RNA ase prior to calcium phosphate gel treatment or by nuclease n A ase RNA ase treatment prior to ion exchange chromatography Nuclease treatment is particularly advantageous if performed under dialyzing conditions at 40 to 400C, preferably at 250C.Gel filtration has been found to be especially useful as a late or final step in the purification when only relatively small volumes of liquid are involved. The enzymes, provided in a sufficiently effective state and concentration, may then be used to catalyse the aforementioned reactions. A typical reaction mixture contains an arabinosyl group donor, a purine base, inorganic phosphate, for example K2HPO4, and the appropriate enzyme or enzymes in an aqueous medium or in a medium containing up to 50 of an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propano, butanol, atone, methylethylketone, ethylacetate, toluene, tetra hydrofuran, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, trichloromethane, or celtosolve. The preferred concentration of organic solvent is 10 . The inorganic phosphate concentration can be from 0.001 mM to 2,000 mM, preferably 1 to 20AmM. The reaction is performed at near neutral pH, that is, in the pH range of about 5 to 9, preferably 6.0 to 8.5 and at a temper Lure of 3 to 70 C, preferably 25 to 45 C. Mild conditions are preferable since the glycosidic bond of purine arabinonucleosides is labile under acid conditions, particularly, at elevated temperatures and the enzymes are unstable at extremes of temperature and pH.The preferable concentration of the enzymes is a function of the substrate efficiency of the articular arabinosyl donors and acceptors used and the l lgth of time that one wishes to allow the reaction to prO ed. With some substrates, for example when R2 H and R Cl in formula 11 , it is preferable to use larger amounts the te enzyme in order to reduce the reaction time because of the instability of the purine base and product in aqueous solution. The purity of the enzymes used is a question of convenience. Crude extracts will catalyze the desired reactions but the yield of product is usually less and its isolation is more difficult than when purified enzymes are used for the reasons explained above.If the enzymes used are stored as amnonium sulfate suspensions, they are preferably added to the reactions as centrifuged pellets from the suspens3ons rather than as the whole suspensions. Enzymes may be salvaged from reaction mixtures, for instance, by batch adsorption onto DEAE cellulose after the reaction has reached a satisfactory point and subsequent removal from the soluble components of the reaction mixture by centrifugation or by gel filtration of reaction mixtures.In some cases, enzymes may be recycleÅa by virtue of the fact that the bulk of the product precipitates out from the reaction mixture and upon its removal, more starting material My be added to the reaction fluid in order that product formation may be resumed. See Example II . Usually it is preferably that all the components are contained in suspension or solution but when highly soluble substrates are used an alternative procedure wherein a solution of the reaction mixture components except enzymes is pumped slowly through a column to which the appropriate enzymes have been fixed, i or instance, when the enzymes are adsorbed to a DEAE celltllose column may be preferable. It has been found that, if it is so desired, enzymes may bo. conserved by allowing reactions to proceed for extended periods of time, for example, up to thirty days or longer.However, for reaction mixtures which are incubated for more than one day it is desirable to have an antimicrobial agent, for example sodium or potassium azide or toluene, in the reaction mixture, unless the reaction mixture i sterilised by filtration or some other technique known to the art. The desired purine arabinonucleosides may be recovered or isolated by any of the known means for separating mixtures of chemical compounds into individual compounds. For example, the separation can be effected by utilizing differences in the solubilities in various solvents between the desired end product and impurities, the difference in their distribution coeaficients between two solvent layers, the difference in their adsorbabilities to an adsorbent such as ipn exchange resins, the difference in their rates of passage through cros linked resins such as polyacrylamide gels, or the difference in their crystallizabilities from a solvent.In cased where the product crystallizes out of the reaction mixture it can be collected by centrifugation or by filtration wit1. or without a filter aid. In practice, these means for separation or isolation are carried out in combination or repeatedly depending on the desired purity and state of the products. The following examples illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit it in any way.EXAMPLE 1 Enzyme PurificationAssay Procedures The purification cf the desired enzymes were monitored by the following assays, all of which were performed at 240C.
