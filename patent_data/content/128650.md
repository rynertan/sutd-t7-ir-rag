# Mechanical damper for disk drives having band drive actuators.

## Abstract
To damp a stepper motor 17 powered band drive 21 for a disk drive, a relatively inexpensive, but efficient mechanical damper comprises a predetermined inertial mass 43 which is concentrically coupled to the capstan 631 of the band drive 21 by an energy absorbing elastomer 42 . The mass 43 , its geometry, and the energy absorbing characteristics of the elas tomer 42 are selected to apply a dynamic force to the stepper motor 17 which opposes and counteracts any unwanted oscilla tion of the stepper motor as the read write head of the disk drive arrives at a selected data track. This damper is relatively free of potential contaminants and is, therefore, particularly attractive for Winchester disk drives.
