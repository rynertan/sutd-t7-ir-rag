## Abstract
A display device for use in a dictation transcription station comprising a plurality of selectively actuatable lighted segments. A pair of shift registers are used to re tain information as to the location of recorded signals denoting ends of dictation segments and location of in structions. As rewound tape is transcribed a third shift register creates a shutter comprising contiguous lighted segments which moves to the right during a transricption operation. Control circuitry allow shifting of the registers containing the end of segment and instruction marks to occur only when the tape is rewound past the farthest point reached during a previous rewinding operation. A display for a dictation recorder is also shown wherein a pair of up down counters 130, 145 control numerical displays re presenting the total length of tape used 20 and the length of the present dictation segment 21 . Apparatus which is sensitive to rewinding of the tape into a previous dictation segment 165, 28 is used to control the present segment counter. The present segment counter may be selectively made 169, 177, 150 to begin counting again upon either entry into the next dictation segment encountered during forward advance or the segment in which dictation was occuring when the rewound operation was initiated.
