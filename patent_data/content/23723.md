# MULTISTAGE AVALANCHE PHOTODETECTOR

## Abstract
A low noise multistage photodetector device 1 is formed from a sequence of pairs of layers of opposite con ductivity type 10, 11 12, 13 13, 15 having heterojunc tions between each pair. The second layer 11, 13, 15 of each pair has a bandgap which is larger than the bandgap of the first layer 10, 12, 14 of said pair. Electrodes 21, 22, 23 are formed on the device so that voltages 30, 31, 32 may be applied to reverse bias the heterojunctions formed between each pair in the sequence and to forward bias the heterojunctions formed between the second layer 11, 13, 15 of one pair and the first layer 12, 14 of another pair. The device provides traps for one sign of carrier, which traps prevent the trapped carrier from avalanching through amplification regions of the device.
