# Thermally stabilized polyetherimides.

## Abstract
A thermally stabilized polyetherimide is disclosed which contains a polyetherimide and a stabilizing amount of an antioxident having a molecular weight of 400 and is selected from the group of hindered phenols, arylphosphonites, or ganic phosphites, thioesters or mixtures thereof. The stabi lized polyetherimides exhibit a prolonged stability under conditions of elevated temperatures.
