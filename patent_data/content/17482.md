# Vehicle speed control system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a motor vehicle speed control system including an engine throttle actuator device 30 comprising a bellows 23 in which the pressure is adjusted, while the system is engaged, by an electromagnetic valve C pulsed by signals from an electronic speed detector to control orifices 17,16 connected to atmosphere and vacuum respectively. A second electromagnetic valve B is biassed by spring 9 when de energized to open orifice 10 to atmosphere rapidly to vent the bellows when the system is disengaged. An additional safety means is provided by a valve 32 which is operated by brake pedal 31 and, when opened, will rapidly vent the bellows 23 through pipe 38 and orifice 39 if valve B malfunctions. Resonator R produces an audible warning signal when air flows there through. The audible warning system may be used for other applications.
