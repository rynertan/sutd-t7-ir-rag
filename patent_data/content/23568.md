# Data interface mechanism for interfacing bit parallel data buses of different bit width.

## Abstract
Data interface mechanism for interfacing an M byte data bus 34a, 34b with an N byte data bus 37 , where M is a multiple of N. The invention provides an automatic mechanism for converting M byte data segments into N byte data segments and vice versa. A number of storage units 22a and 22b are located intermediate the M byte and the N byte data buses, the number of storage units being equal to the ratio of M to N and each such storage unit having a width of N bytes. The storage units are ac cessed one at a time in a rotating manner for transferring N byte data segments between the N byte data bus and different ones of the storage units. All the storage units are simultaneously accessed for transferring M byte data seg ments between the M byte data bus and the storage units.
