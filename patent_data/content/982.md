# Electromagnetically actuated lens drive.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a motorised focusing system with an electromagnetically actuated lens drive, for example for use in a photographic camera having an automatic rangefinder. The lens 16 is adjusted axially by the rotation of the lens holder 14 on a fixed support 40 . The lens holder is rotated by an epicyclic motor having a stator 46 concentric with the optical axis of the lens with poles 48 which are energised sequentially to cause a hollow armature 36 within the stator to roll eccentrically around a fixed armature support 54 . Armature teeth 70 engage teeth 72 on the fixed armature support and armature teeth 78 engage teeth 80 on the lens holder 14 , resulting in a speed reduction in the drive to the lens holder. The lens moves incrementally in response to pulses applied to the stator windings, a given number of pulses representing a known amount of axial movement of the lens.
