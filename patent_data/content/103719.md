# A method of image display by ultrasonic microscope.

## Abstract
A method of image display of a specimen by an ultrasonic wave microscope comprising an acoustic wave propagating medium 1 , a piezoelectric member 2 pro vided at one end of said medium 1 for generating an ultrasonic beam 6 , and an acoustic wave lens formed at an opposite end of said acoustic wave propagating medium 1 and having a predetermined focal point, said method comprising the steps of two dimensionally scanning a specimen 7 disposed substantially at said focal point by said ultrasonic beam 6 while moving one of said specimen 7 and said beam 6 relative to the other, and applied to said specimen repetitive stress selectively during the scanning of said specimen 7 .
