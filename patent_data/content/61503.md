# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING HOT ROLLED DUAL PHASE HIGH TENSILE STEEL PLATE.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing hot rolled dual phase high tensile steel plate composed of martensite ferrite composite layers having a tensile strength of 50 to 80 kg mmÂ² as hot rolled, which process comprises hot rolling steel pieces composed of 0.03 to 0.15 C, 0.5 to 1.0 Mn, 0.8 to 2.0 Si, 0.6 to 2.0 Cr, 0.01 to 0.1 Al, balance of Fe and unavoidable impurities at 1050 to 1220 C, completing the hot rolling at temperatures of 800 to 900 C, cooling to 350 to 500 C, and winding up at this temperature. Hot rolled dual phase high tensile steel plate having good workability and uniform mechanical properties can be obtained at low cost without adding expensive Mo by properly combining the above described steel ingredient composition, steel heating temperature before hot rolling, hot rolling completing temperature, and winding up temperature.
