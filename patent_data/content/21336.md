# Optical display devices.

## Abstract
A projection display device is provided in which variation in the index of refraction is used to modulate attenuated total reflection. The illustrated device comprises a thin film of silver deposited on a sapphire slide which optically contacts the base of a prism. The silver film is in contact with a suitable electrolyte and forms one electrode of an electrochemical cell. By electrodeposition from the cell on to the silver film, the reflectivity of the film is changed and the intensity of the emergent light beam varied. The silver film may be formed as a matrix of individually addressable elements so that a two dimensional display can be formed.
