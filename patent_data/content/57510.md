# Improvements in the production of hydrocarbon resins and products resulting therefrom.

## Abstract
Hydrocarbon resins having an increased softening point are obtained by a process featuring the sequential steps of isomerizing the 2 methylbutene 1 component of a branched olefin modifier stream whereby its 2 methyl butene 2 content is enriched polymerizing a feedstock consisting of the mixture of said enriched modifier stream and a piperylene rich feed stream and, recovering said hydrocarbon resin with proper ties enhancing its utility for adhesive applications.
