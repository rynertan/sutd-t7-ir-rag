## Description
Method of erecting a building structure and building structure erected by the same. The invention relates to a method of erecting a building of prefabricated concrete elements. Such a method is known In the known methods a flight of dwellings is frequently assembled in an expensive sequence of setting and transport steps, particularly dwellings erected in highly industrialized countries. If such a building system were used in a country not having a modern infrastructure, the means for assembling the building structure usually do not exhibit the same refinement, whilst in many countries water supply and sewer systems and the like are not provided for up to the houses. The invention particularly relates to a method of erecting very cheap building structures, for example, very cheap dwellings, which can be locally assembled without much cost and which can be readily adapted to modified conditions when utility systems are extended so that the dwellings will be more comfortable. TAe method according to the invention is character ized in that at least one table shaped structural element consisting of a horizontal slab of reinforced concrete supported by legs is deposited at its place zon an underground, after which prefabricated wall elements are placed against this structural element and subsequently secured by their upper edge to said slab. A satisfactory fixation of the building structure with respect to the underground is obtained, when for each leg a concrete foot having a recess is provided in the substrate. In order to erect buildings with reduced risks for the inhabitants, even in regions sensitive to earthquakes, a preferred form of the method is characterized in that the lower end of each leg is arranged in the recess with the interposition of an elastic lining. In order to provide a high rigidity for the building structure a further developed, preferred method is characterized in that at least two contiguous wall elements are tightened together by means of horizontal tightening elements. In order to erect a multi storey building by using the same basic elements a preferred method according to the invention is characterized in that a multi storey building is erected by superposing at least one table shaped structural element on the slab of a previously disposed table shaped structural element. The invention furthermore provides a building erected by the method according to the invention, in which the reinforced concrete slab is made from light concrete not only to facilitate mounting but also for protection against excessive solar heat or to prevent loss of energy from the dwellings. For the same reasons in a preferred embodiment of the building the wall elements joined to form a wall are also made from light concrete. The above mentioned and further features of the invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing. In the drawing there is schematically illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 a front view and a side elevation respectively of a building in accordance with the invention, Figure 3 a vehicle loading a prefabricated building element at a manufacturing site, Figures 4 and 5 each a side elevation of the vehicle shown in Figure 3 at respectively later instants, Figures 6 and 7 each a perspective view during the erection of the building of Figure 1, Figure 8 a variant of detail VIII of Figure 7, Figures 9 and 10 a front view and a side elevation respectively of the building during the erection by a further method in accordance with the invention, Figures 11 and 12 a front view and a side elevation respectively of a further building in accordance with the invention, Figures 13 and 14 a front view and a side elevation respectively of the building of Figures 11 and 12 during the erection, Figures 15 and 16, 17 and 18 and 19 and 20 a front view and a side elevation respectively of, each time, a further building in accordance with the invention, and Figure 21 a front view on a reduced scale of the building of Figure 19 during the construction. Figures 1 and 2 show a building 1, forming a dwelling, constructed by the method in accordance with the invention. On the building site 2, where this dwelling has to be erected, a floor 4, for example, of tiles is deposited on a preferably levelled underground 3. As an alternative, as is illustrated in Figure 7, only tiles 5 may be deposited on the spot supporting the walls of the building 1 or even only at the corners of the building 1. On a manufacturing site 6 usually at a distance from the building site 2 the table shaped structural elements 7 are prefabricated from reinforced concrete, each element consisting of a horizontal slab 8 with longitudinal beams 9 of reinforced, preferably light weight concrete, to which slab are moulded reinforced concrete legs 10. On the manufacturing site 6 the structural element 7 is loaded on a vehicle 11 provided with hoisting means 12 and transported in the elevated state along a road 13 towards the building site 2, where it is disposed on the underground 3, the slab 8 with its legs 10 being supported by the previously deposited tiles 5. Then, preferably also from the manufacturing site 6, prefabricated wall elements 14 of reinforced, light weight concrete are transported to the building site 2 and disposed against the structural element 7.As shown in Figures 6 and 7 this can be performed in a simple manner by manual labour, since the wall elements 14 can be readily carried by means of bars 15 by eight persons 16 and can be erected by four persons 16 at the structural element 7 by anchoring the lower edge 17 by means of cables 18 and pins 20 inserted into holes 19 of the wall elements 14 and an anchoring pin 21 inserted into the ground, whilst the upper edge 22 is pulled upwards by the four persons 16 by means of a cable 23, which is passed through a hole 24 in a transverse beam 27 of the structural element 7. Subsequently, the wall elements 14 are each secured to the structural element 7, for example, by means of bolts passed through holes 24 or other connecting members. The wall elements 14 are provided, as the case may be, with a door 25 or a window 26. A firm fixation of the building 1 is obtained by providing in the underground 3 for each leg 10 a concrete foot 29 having a recess 28, which is shown for a variant of detail VIII in figure 8. In regions susceptible of earthquakes the lower end 30 of each leg 10 is inserted into the recess 28 preferably with the interposition of an elastic lining 31. In an alternative shown in Figures 9 and 10 a structural element 32 can be deposited on a substrate 3 by prefabricating a horizontal slab 8 without legs on the manufacturing site 6 and by depositing it at the building site 2 on legs 33, with which it is connected. These legs 33 are preferably formed by metal pipes bearing on feet 34 emEedEÃ©d in the substrate 3 in order to safeguard the building from earthquakes. In a further embodiment of the method according to the invention, shown in Figures 11 to 14, structural elements 35 consisting each of a horizontal slab 36 of reinforced, light weight concrete without transverse or longitudinal beams and of two legs 37 rigidly secured thereto in the transverse medium plane and of four detachable legs 38 at the corners, four removable wedges 39 and tiles 5 are supported by the substrate 3 so that the slab 36 is located at a slightly higher level above the substrate 3 than afterwards in the erected building of Figures 11 and 12. The wall elements 14 are orientated to the slab 36 at a place on top of the tiles 5 and are interconnected by means of bracing bars 40 passed through horizontal pipes 41 embedded in the wall elements 14.Finally the wedges 39 are removed and the slab 36 is lowered down to the wall elements 14, whilst the legs 38 are removed and the legs 37 will bear on tiles 5. Figures 15 and 16 illustrate a building 42, which may form a small dwelling and comprises only one structural element 7 which is surrounded on all sides by wall elements 14. Figures 17 and 18 show a building 43 according to the invention, which is distinguished from the buildings described above particularly by an additional roof 44, the elements 45 of which are arranged above slabs 8. The roof elements 45 comprise each a horizontal roof slab 46 with ribs 47 on its lower side they particularly serve for heat insulation and as an architectural sunshade. Figures 19 and 20 show a multi storey building 48 erected, as shown in Figure 21, by superposing table shaped structural elements 49 on a slab 8 of a previously disposed structural element 7 with the aid of a hoisting tool 50.
