# Method of metallizing sintered ceramics materials.

## Abstract
A method of metallizing a sintered ceramics material containing a silicon compound in which, on a surface of ceramics containing a silicon compound, a manganese containing metal layer is formed and heated. To achieve a rapid reaction between the silicon compound and the manganese, the metal layer is formed so that it is substan tially free from any gaps with the ceramics surface and the resultant structure is heated to a temperature lower than the melting point of manganese to effect the reaction. To form the metal layer, a deposited film is formed by vacuum evaporation or sputtering manganese metal or a manganese alloy or a melt of a manganese copper, manganese nickel or manganese titanium alloy is formed on the ceramics surface under the application of a pressure. This method can effect metallization at a lower temperature and in a short period of time.
