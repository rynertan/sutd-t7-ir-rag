# Process for granulating chemical products and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A proces for granulating chemical products, according to which recycled granules are conveyed to a rotary drum through an end thereof and are lifted by blades 13 protruding from the drum inner surface 12 , thus falling onto an inner fixed structure, which cause the forming of a vertical curtain of granules, onto which curtain a solution containing the product to be granulated is sprayed the product solidifying on the granules, which granules, after subsequent falls, are coated with a plurality of layers of solid product before leaving the drum through the other end. The process is characterized in that the inner fixed structure 4 8 conveys the falling granules in at least two vertical curtains 1, 2, 3 parallel to each other and to the drum axis, while a portion of the granules, on the side of the downward movement of the drum, directly falls, without passing through a vertical curtain, onto a fixed baffle 11 , which is arranged substan tially in the lower half of the drum, on the side of the downward movement.
