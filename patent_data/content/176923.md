# Automated handling system.

## Abstract
Apparatus and process are disclosed for removing a single flexible member from a storage spool capable of holding multiple flexible members. This storage spool is designed to contain multiple elongated flexible members in an accurate position on the spool by means of radial channels or slots where the flexible members are held in place by interwinding material. By removing the interwind ing material on a take up spool the individual flexible member can be positioned for removal from the storage spool by a pick up head or vacuum transport member. The invention has particular applicability to the handling of test devices, such as reagent strips, used in the determination of a biological constituent in a body fluid.
