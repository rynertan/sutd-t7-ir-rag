## Description
CIRCUIT CONTROLLING THE ERAAURE OF ELECTRONIC STOOGES. The invention regards an electronic circuit which, when applied to apparatuses for the erasure of electronic storages memories will cut off the ultraviolet rays lamp supply when the storages to be erased have been exposed to a programmed quantity of rays. At present, the electronic storages which must be erased of their information content, are exposed to the ultraviolet rays emitted by a lamp, for a period of time predetermined in an approximate way. he duration of said period depends besides on the type of storages to be erased on the intensity of the rays emitted by the lamp. Accordingly, as a rule, said duration is determined empirically and the operators conform for safety s sake to values in excess thus preventing an imperfect erasure verifiable from the reading of the information contents of the storages being subjected to erasure. When the erasure operation takes place in a repetitive wayt the over exposure of the storage or memory X to ultraviolet rays brings about only a waist of time, therefore, it would be an advantage the presence of a detector able to check with precision if the erasure has taken place so to allow the operator to replace at the right moment the erased storages with others which have to be erased. The circuit of the present patent permits to overcome the present approximation and empiricism of the erasure procedures by filling in the above mentioned gap. Substantially, the present circuit comprises a photoresistance which will be laid on the plane on which the storages are laid to be exposed to the ultraviolet rays emitted by a suitable lamp in order to be erased.A suitable screen, acting as a filter, wraps the photosensitive element to allow the effect of the sole ultra violet rays emitted by the lamp in order to make directly proportional between each other the intensity of these rays and the photoresistor conductivity or other equivalent element. The quantity of current which goes through the photosensitive element usually a photoresistor will be therefore a function of the exposure time and of the intensity of the ultraviolet rays emitted by the lamp which, besides striking the photoresistor, will also strike the storages to be erased. An integrator, programmable by the operator so as to adapt the circuit of the invention to the type of storages to be erased, measures the quantity of current which has passed through the photoresistor and, once reached the programmed value, actuates a relay which cuts off the lamp supply to allow then the timely replace ment of the erased storages with others which must still be subjected to such an operation. The present invention is illustrated by way of exemplification in the accompanying table. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram and Fig. 2 shows in section a photosensitive element according to the invention. In Fig. 1, 1 indicates the supply unit which can supply as well other circuits of the apparatus to which the invention is applied 2 indicates the integrating circuit to which the photosensitive element 3 usually made up of a photoresistancs is applied. The photosensitive element 3 is made sensitive only to the ultraviolet rays by means of a screening 5 made up, for example, of a fluorescent film able to act as a filter and permitting therefore only the ultraviolet rays to come into action among all the others emitted by the lamp only these rays excite the filter layer 5, which at its turn influences the photosensitive element. The integrating circuit 2 is programmed by the operator to actuate the relay 4, or other element capable of cutting off the circuit 7 of power supply to the ultraviolet rays lamp L when the quantity of the current which has passed through the element 3 reaches the desired value. The present invention, therefore, permits to automatically change the exposure time of the storages X to be erased when, for any reason, changes take place in the emission of rays from the lamp, allowing to check the storages efficiency level as well.
