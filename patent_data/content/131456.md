## Description
TITLE PReiDUCTION OF VITAMIN Bq 2 UMYING A FUSED CELL BID The present invention relates to a fused cell hybrid having a high productivity of vitamin B12 cobalamin , to a process for producing the hybrid and further to a process for preparing vitamin B12 by culturing the hybrid, More in detail, the present invention relates to a fused cell hybrid obtained by fusing a cell of a photosynthetic microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides with a cell of a methanol assimilating microorganism of Protaminobacter ruber. More in detail, the present invention relates to 1 Rhodopseudomonas protamicus itself, 2 a process for originating Rhodopseudomonas protamicus, comprising subjecting a photosynthetic bacterial species, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides and a methanol assimilating bacterial species, Protaminobacter ruber, to bacterial cell fusion and 3 a process for fermentatively producing vitamin B12, comprising culturing a strain of the originated Rhodopseudomonas protamicus and collecting vitaminB12 produced by the strain and accumulated within and outside the bacterial bodies thereof. It has been well known that vitamin B12 participates in metabolism of various substances such as nucleic acids, proteins, amino acids such as methionine and lipids within living bodies. In recent years, utilization of vitamin B12 as a medicine has been increased for treating the disturbance of myelopoietic function, the hepatic disturbance and the disease of nerve system other than the treatment and prevention of the deficiency diseases of vitamin B12. Furthermore, various physiological functions of vitamin B12 such as the remarkable immunity regulating function of methyl vitamin B12 have been elucidated so that an importance of vitamin B12 is increased. If vitamin B12 is produced by an organic synthesis, the yield is low and the cost of the produced vitamin B12 is very expensive because the chemical structure of vitamin B12 is very complicated and a stereoisomeric structure exists in the side chain of corrin ring in vitamin B12 so that the large number of synthetic steps are required. Accordingly, vitamin B12 is exclusively produced by a fermentative process. However, even when vitamin B12 is produced by the fermentative process, it is expensive because of the low productivity of the hitherto known bacteria producing vitamin B12.The utilization of bacteria belonging to Propionibacterium,Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter, Achromobacter, Klebsiella,Rhodopseudomonas, Pseudomonas, Protaminobacter, Streptomyces,Rhodospirillum, Actinomyces, Cellulomonas, Ruminantium, Nocardia or Methanomonas has been known for producing vitamin B12.The productivity of vitamin B12 in the known bacteria is at most about 0.2 to about 23 mg t of the liquid culture medium and is not satisfiable in industrial production. Accordingly, it is demanded to research for a microorganism having a high productivity of vitamin B12. As a result of the present inventors studies for producing a microorganism having a high productivity of vitaminB12 by cell fusion, the present inventors have attained the present invention. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fused cell hybrid having a productivity of vitamin B12, obtained by fusing a cell of a microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides with a cell of a microorganism of Protaminobacter ruber. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a fused cell hybrid having a productivity of vitamin B12, which comprises fusing a cell of a microorganism ofRhodopseudomonas spheroides with a cell of a microorganism ofProtaminobacter ruber. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing vitamine B12, which comprises culturing a fused cell hybrid having a productivity of vitamin B12, said hybrid being obtained by fusing a cell of a microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides with a cell of a microorganism of Protaminobacter ruber, and collecting vitamin B12. In the drawing, the single figure is a flowchart of biosynthesis of vitamin B12. The hybrids of the present invention have a productivity of vitamin B12 of about 135 mg Q of liquid culture medium or higher than about 135 mg Q of liquid culture medium. In the process for producing a fused cell hybrid of the present invention, protoplasts of the cells may be formed by the known method, for example, the method described in Agric.Biol. Chem., 45 6 , 1515 1981 . However, it is preferable to utilize a modified method of the known method, wherein the amount of lysozyme is larger than that of the known method and the freezing treatment is not carried out in the present invention. As the bacterial cells for use in fusing treatment of the formed protoplasts, the cells in any stage may be used, if the cells are the complete bacterial bodies. Nevertheless, those bacterial bodies in the latter period of the logarithmic growth phase are preferable, since the efficiency of the production of protoplasts is increased. For culturing the bacterial bodies, a general culture medium is used in accordance with the conventional procedures for culturing a bacteria. The treatment of cell fusion in the present invention is carried out in accordance with the publicly known method except for adding methanol to the culture medium. In general, the artificial origination of a bacterial strain by cell fusion has been regarded to be extremely difficult because the stabilization of the characters given to the originated bacterial cells is very difficult. There is a rare occurrence of origination in strains obtained by cell fusion, in which the character s given by the cell fusion has been stabilized without specified treatment. In many cases, various treatments have been tried to stabilize the character s given to the strain originated by the cell fusion. In order to stabilize such character s given to the newly originated bacterial strain by cell fusion according to the present invention, it is preferable to expose the cells to ultraviolet rays, for instance, for 20 to 300 sec, more preferably for 30 to 250 sec to the ultraviolet rays from two 10 w ultraviolet lamps at a distance of 30 cm from the cells and as a result, the preferable bacterial strain is obtained in which the character s given by the cell fusion is stabilized. By the way, it has been already known that one of the parent microorganism, Protaminobacter ruber, has a productivity of vitamin B12, however, it is only 0.2 to 1.0 mg of liquid culture medium. As will be seen in the attached drawing, vitamin B12 is biosynthetically produced from glycine and succinyl CoA via aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen and cobyrinic acid, or via 6 aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrinogenIII and cobyrinic acid. In the biosynthetic system, protoporphyrin IX is produced in a small amount from uroporphyrinogen III and then, is accumulated in the system. The accumulation of protoporphyrinIX inhibits 6 aminolevulinic acid synthetase and therefore, the preparation of 6 aminolevulinic acid is suppressed.It is considered that this mechanism has a relationship to the low productivity of vitamin B12 in the biosynthetic system. Another one of the parent microorganism, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, is a photosynthetic bacteria and is high in the productivity of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is also produced from glycine and succinyl CoA biosynthetically via aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrinogen III and protoporphyrin IX, as vitamin B12. Since Rhodopseudomonas spheroides produces a large amount of chlorophyll in spite of the production of protoporphyrin IX, it is considered that the 6 aminolevulinic acid synthetase is not inhibited by the production of protoporphyrin IX. A fused cell line according to the present invention is obtained by fusing a cell of the microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides with a cell of the microorganism ofProtaminobacter ruber, and selecting fused cell hybrid having a high productivity of vitamin B12. The selected hybrid of the present invention retains a productive character of vitamin B12 according to Protaminobacter ruber and is provided with a character that 6 aminolevulinic acid synthetase is not inhibited by protoporphyrin IX. One of the fused cell hybrid of the present invention has been deposited on September 10, 1982 in Fermentation ResearchInstitute Agency of Industrial Science and Technology underBudapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure. The accession number given by the International Depository Authority of the hybrid of the present invention is FERM BP 180. The fused cell line of the present invention is novel and is named as WRhodopseudomonas protamicus . As the parent bacterial species for use according to the present invention, the above mentioned pair of bacterial species may be mentioned as a preferable example. In addition, every chlorophyll producing bacterial species belonging to the photosynthetic genus, Rhodopseudomonas, as one of the pair may be used and every cobalamin producing bacterial species belonging to the methanol metabolizing genus, Protaminobacter, as the other of the pair may be used.

As the culture medium for culturing microorganism ofRhodopseudomonas protamicus originated by the present invention, any synthetic or artificial culture medium may be used provided that the culture medium contains the sources for carbon and nitrogen, inorganic salts and minute amounts of nutrients necessary for the growth of the microorganism in the respective proper amounts. As the carbon source, one of various carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, starch, aqueous solution of hydrolysed starch and molasses sugar alcohols such as glycerol various organic carboxylic acids such as pyruvic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid and the like or methanol may be used. As the nitrogen source, ammonia, one of various inorganic ammonium salts and organic ammonium salts such as ammonium phosphate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium acetate, one of nitrogencontaining substances such as urea one of nitrogen containing organic substances such as peptone, NZ amine, malt extract, meat extract, yeast extract, corn steep liquor, casein hydrolyzate, fish meal and digested fish meal, amino acids, de fatted soy bean cakes and digested products thereof may be used. It is preferable to use the culture medium containing a large amount of the nitrogen source which contains a large amount of available nitrogen to the microorganism so as to obtain a large amount of vitamin B12.As the inorganic salts, dipotassium monohydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, calcium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate and cobalt chloride may be used. The e presence of divalent cobalt ions in the culture medium is inevitably required and the concentration of divalent cobalt ions in the culture medium is related to the yield of vitamin B12 produced by the hybrid. The yield of vitamin B12 is extremely high in the culture medium in the case where an amount of divalent cobalt ions corresponding to 10 to 100 mg of CoC12 6H2O are present in one litre of liquid culture medium.In addition, the presence of the other metallic ions affects the production of vitamin B12. The addition of both divalent calcium ions and ferrous ions or the addition of three divalent ions of divalent calcium ions, ferrous ions and divalent manganese ions acts in accelerating the production of vitamin B12. Furthermore, the production of vitamin B12 is accelerated by the addition of a vitamin such as vitamin B1, biotin and nicotinic acid and by the addition of an amino acid such as methionine, glycine and serine to the culture medium. In the case where the microorganism requires the other nutritive substances such as the other vitamins, amino acids, inorganic salts, organic salts and minerals, it is necessary to add the required nutritive substances to the culture medium, however, in the case where the components of the culture medium contain such indispensable substances, it is not necessary to add such nutritive substances. As a concrete example of the culture mediums for culturing a microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas protamicus of the present invention in order to produce vitamin B12, the following culture medium may be mentioned. This culture medium is hereinafter referred to as B II culture medium glucose 10 g polypepton 10 g yeast extract 10 g urea 1.5 g ammonium sulfate 1.5 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate 0.5 g dipotassium monohydrogen phosphate 2.5 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.3 g calcium chloride dihydrate 10 mg zinc sulfate heptahydrate 10 mg ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 10 mg manganese sulfate heptahydrate 1 mg cobalt chloride hexahydrate 100 mg The components of the culture medium are dissolved in de ionized water to obtain one litre of the culture medium having pH 7.0. Of course, the obtained culture medium is one of concrete examples for use in the present invention. The other suitable nutrients, minute ingredients and precursor of vitamin B12 for instance, 5,6 dimethylbenzimidazole as a constituent of the lower ligand in vitamin B12, may be added to the culture medium. Rhodopseudomonas protamicus of the present invention may be cultured by stationary culture, shaking culture, anaerobic culture under illumination or spinner culture under aeration.The culture is carried out generally at a culturing temperature of 20 to 440C, preferably 30 to 370C and at a pH of the culture medium of 6.0 to 8.8, preferably at a controlled pH in a range from 7.0 to 7.5 by the addition of a pR buffer and or a neutralizing agent for 2 to 7 days. In ordinary cases of such a culture, both the growth rate of the bacterial bodies and the production rate of vitamin B12 attain their maximum by 3 to 5 days. Although a part of the produced vitamin B12 by the microorganism is contained in the culture medium used therefor, a larger part thereof is contained in the proliferated bacterial bodies. Accordingly, in order to detect vitamin B12 , the pH of the whole cultured matter is adjusted to 6.0 by the addition of sulfuric acid thereto and potassium cyanide is added to the adjusted whole cultured matter so as to bring the concentration of potassium cyanide in the resultant mixture finally to 0.01 by weight, and the prepared mixture is treated in autoclave for 15 min under a pressure of 1.2 kg cmê. Thereafter, the treated mixture is subjected to a conventional microbiological method for quantitatively determining vitamin B12 by the use ofLactobacillus leichmannii to detect and determine the amount of vitamin B12 in the whole mixture. In order to detect and determine vitamin B12 contained in the proliferated bacterial bodies, the whole cultured matter is subjected to centrifugal separation, the separated bacterial bodies is washed with water, the washed bacterial bodies are subjected to treatment in autoclave in the same manner as above and then the treated matter is subjected to the same procedures of detecting and determining vitamin B12 as above. Besides, after washing the bacterial bodies, 100 times by weight of 80 aqueous ethanolic solution that is, a mixture of 80 by weight of ethanol and 20 by weight of water containing 0.01 of potassium cyanide are added to the washed bacterial bodies and the pE of the mixture is adjusted to 6.0, and the adjusted mixture is extracted by aqueous ethanol while stirring the mixture for 20 min at 88 to 900 C. The whole system is cooled to room temperature after extraction and the extraction residue is removed by centrifugal separation. Ethanol is distilled off from the obtained supernatant at 400C under a reduced pressure and the obtained residual matter is subjected to the above mentioned conventional microbiological method for quantitatively determining vitaminB12 by using Lactobacillus leichmannii. The collection of vitamin B12 from the whole cultured matter may be carried out by the following conventional process for isolating and purifying vitamin B12. For instance, the whole cultured matter is at first subjected to centrifugal treatment for separating into the bacterial bodies and the supernatant liquid, and vitamin B12 is obtained from each of the separated fractions by the following steps 1 Steps for obtaining vitamin B12 from the bacterial bodies In order to separate vitamin B12 from the bacterial bodies without changing the state thereof in the bacterial body, i.e., methylcobalamin and or 5,6 dimethylbenzimidazole cobamide coenzyme hereinafter referred to as DBCC as a solid or syrup like material, the bacterial bodies are boiled in water regulated to pH of 5.0 by sulfuric acid to extract vitamin B12. After cooling the treated mixture, the bacterial bodies are removed by centrifugation and the supernatant is condensed to obtain the object product. Besides, the bacterial bodies are subjected to extraction with 80 aqueous ethanolic solution by boiling for 20 min at 1000C to obtain vitamin B12. Further, vitamin B12 may be extracted from the bacterial bodies with 20 aqueous solution of pyridine that is, a mixture of 20 by weight of pyridine and 80 by weight of water . On the other hand, in order to separate vitamin B12 as a stable compound, that is cyanocobalamin, the bacterial bodies are extracted with an aqueous solution containing cyanide ions or an aqueous ethanolic solution containing cyanide ions under heating by the conventional method and the liquid extract is condensed to obtain vitamin B12 as cyanocobalamin. However, in order to obtain a highly purified product of vitamin B12, it is preferable to subject the liquid extract to the treatment such as extraction with phenol, the treatment with activated carbon or ion exchanger such as ion exchange resin, ion exchange cellulose and fractionation according to molecular weight or to the combination thereof. An aqueous solution containing vitamin B12 at a relatively high concentration is obtained by the above mentioned treatment and then vitamin B12 is obtained as pure crystals by adding an organic solvent such as acetone to the aqueous solution. 2 Steps for obtaining vitamin B12 from the supernatant The supernatant liquid obtained from the cultured matter by centrifugal separation is, at first, subjected to condensation to dryness and thereafter, the obtained condensate is subjected to the series of extraction and purification in the same manner as those used in the extraction of vitamin B12 from the bacterial bodies so as to obtain purified vitamin B12. The present invention relates to a process for fermentatively producing vitamin B12 at a high concentration by the newly originated microorganism obtained by cell fusion of two kinds of microorganisms based on the new idea of the present inventors concerning the combination of microbial biosynthetic capabilities of two microorganisms by cell fusion thereof and the utilization of the two metabolic pathways thereof. The process of the present invention can produce vitamin B12 economically in a large scale and accordingly, the present invention possesses a high industrial merit. The present invention will be explained more in detail while referring to the following non limitative examples In addition, the amount and the purity of vitamin B12 shown in Examples have been determined by the following methods while comparing to those of a commercialized reagent grade vitamin B12 made by Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd. .Methods for determining the amount and purity of vitamin B12 1.

EXAMPLE 1 Origination of Fused Cell Hybrids by Cell Fusion of Two Mutually Different Microorganism 1 1 Formation of Protoplast In 10 ml of H II culture medium preliminarily sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 1200 C, the microorganism of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides deposited in theInstitute for Fermentation Osaka, Japan under the deposition number of IFO 12203 was inoculated and was cultured for 24 hours at 300C while shaking the inoculated culture medium. The cultured bacteria as the mother bacteria were inoculated to a new H II culture medium preliminarily treated as above at a volume concentration of 1 and were subjected to shaking culture for 15 hours at 300C. The cultured bacterial bodies at the later period of logarithmic proliferation stage were collected while avoiding contamination by the other kind of bacteria and were washed with sterilized water. The following procedures were carried out while avoiding contamination by the other kind of bacteria. The washed bacterial bodies were suspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution of pH 8.0, which had been preliminarily sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 1200C and contained 1 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA and 20 of sucrose. Then, 10 mg of abacterially filtered lysozyme was added thereto and the added suspension was subjected to shaking treatment for 30 min at 300C under 180 r.p.m. On the other hand, the protoplast of Protaminobacter ruber deposited in the Institute for Fermentation Osaka, Japan under the deposition number IFO 3708 was prepared as follows.In 10 ml of H lI culture medium preliminarily sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 1200C, the microorganism of Protaminobacter ruber was inoculated and was cultured for 24 hours at 300C while shaking the inoculated culture medium. The cultured bacteria as the mother bacteria were inoculated to a new H II culture medium preliminarily treated as above at a volume concentration of 1 and were subjected to shaking culture for 15 hours at 300C. The cultured bacterial bodies at the later period of logarithmic proliferation stage were collected and were washed with sterilized water.The washed bacterial bodies were suspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution of pH 8.0, which had been preliminarily sterilized in an autoclave for 20 min at 1200C and contained 1 mM of EDTA and 20 of sucrose. Thereafter, 10 mg of abacterially filtered lysozyme was added to the suspension and further, methanol was added thereto so that the final concentration of methanol is 0.2 and then, the added suspension was subjected to shaking treatment for 30 min at 300C under 180 r.p.m. Just after the treatment, an aqueous suspension containing 10 cells of the formed protoplast of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides IFO 12203 in one millilitre thereof was prepared by adjusting the cell concentration in the treated suspension with the addition of the buffer solution. In quite the same manner as above an aqueous suspension containing 103 cells of the obtained protoplast of Protaminobacter ruber IFO 3708 in one millilitre was obtained.1 2 Treatment for Cell Fusion of Protoplast One millilitre of the prepared aqueous suspension of the protoplasts of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides IFO 12203 was mixed with one millilitre of the prepared aqueous suspension of the protoplasts of Protaminobacter ruber IFO 3708. While maintaining the mixture at 50C, the mixture was subjected to centrifugal separation for 10 min at 8000 r.p.m., and after removing the supernatant liquid, 3 ml of 40 aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of 4000 that is, a mixture of 40 by weight of polyethylene glycol and 60 by weight of water were added to the residue. The prepared aqueous suspension was subjected to cell fusion treatment for one min at OOC. 1 3 Regeneration and Culture of the Cell Fused Hybrid Obtained by Cell Fusion The aqueous suspension obtained by the treatment for protoplast fusion was diluted with the same buffer solution mentioned in Example 1 1 and the diluted suspension was added to a preliminarily adjusted and sterilized bouillon sucrose hypertonic buffer solution containing 0.4 of methanol and an antibiotic. The prepared mixture was scattered onto a flat plate of 1.5 to 2.0 of agar and after piling a soft layer of 0.5 8 agar which was kept at about 37 to 400C on the flat plate, the piled layers were cultured for one week at 300C to form a few bacterial colonies. The few bacterial colonies appeared on the agar layers. Each colony was separately inoculated on a H II agar culture medium. After separating single colony recognized to have originated by the cell fusion, each of the separated colonies was subjected to shaking culture in a H II liquid culture medium at 300C for 16 hours. Then, each cultured matter was diluted with sterilized water and after plating out the diluted matter on a B II agar culture medium, the treated agar culture medium was exposed to ultraviolet rays from two 10 W luminescent lamps at a distance of 30 cm for 30 to 240 sec. Subsequently, the fused cells were cultured for 7 to 10 days at 300C, thereby obtaining bacterial cells hybrids formed by cell fusion having stabilized characters. Hybrids showing a high productivity of vitamin B12 of the present invention were selected from the obtained hybrids formed by the cell fusion of two publicly known microorganisms and provided with stabilized characters. The hybrid cell line of the present invention is referred to as Rhodopseudomonas protamicus. Further, from the selected cells, a specified strain of bacterial cells showed the result of mutual crossing over of the resistant character and the susceptible character of the two parent microorganism to antibiotics used as fusion markers. The selected group of the hybrid cells formed by the cell fusion of the two microorganism shows the characteristic resistance to colimycin and also to bacitracin, the characteristic susceptibility to cephalothin and the methanol metabolising property faint , and such a group of hybrid cells has been identified as a new microorganism by the present inventors as will be described later and has been deposited under the asseccion number of FERM BP 180. By preliminarily adding each antibiotic and methanol to the culture medium for use in regeneration and selection of the fused protoplasts, it was possible to effectively obtain the strain of hybrid cells having the characters suitable for the object of the present invention. Concerning the classification of the obtained hybrid, the present inventors carried out the classification according to the descriptions in Bergey s Manual of DeterminativeBacteriology , 8th Ed. and identified the hybrid of the bacterial cells as that belonging to the genus Rhodopseudomonas. This hybrid of the present invention differs from one of the parent bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides IFO 12203, in the color tone when cultured respectively in bouillonagar plate and slant culture and H II culture medium, in the state of protuberance on the surface and the colour of the colonies, in the utilizability of ammonium nitrate, in the temperature range for growth, in the optimal temperature for growth, in the susceptibility to antibiotics and in the property of metabolizing methanol.Also, this hybrid differs from the other of the parent bacteria, Protaminobacter ruber IFO 3708, in the color tone when cultured respectively in bouillon agar plate and slant culture and H Il culture medium, in the utilizability of citric acid, in the urease activity thereof, in the temperature range for growth, in the behavior to oxygen, in the reaction to O F test and in the formation of acids from sugars such as D xylose and D fructose. The thus newly originated hybrid of bacterial cells by cell fusion has been identified as a new microorganism possessing mainly the characters of one of the parent bacteria,Rhodopseudomonas spheroides IFO 12203 and other characters such as the characteristic resistance to two antibiotics, colimycin and bacitracin, the characteristic susceptibility to cephalothin and the methanol anabolism property which are possessed by the other of the parent bacteria, Protaminobacter ruber IFO 3708 and named as Rhodopseudomonas protamicus by the present inventors.EXAMPLE 2 2 1 Production of Cyanocobalamin CN vitamin B12 The cell line of Rhodopseudomonas protamicus originated in Example 1, deposited in the Fermentation Research Institute,Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japanese Government under the asseccion number of FERM BP 180, was utilized. The hybrid of the present invention was preliminarily cultured for 5 days in H II agar culture medium at 300C. In a 300 ml flask for shaking, 100 ml of H II culture medium were introduced and the culture medium together with the flask were sterilized in autoclave for 20 min at 1200C.Thereafter, one platinum loop full of the cultured hybrid was inoculated to the prepared H II culture medium in the flask for shaking and the inoculum was subjected to culture at 300C for 2 days while placing the flask on a rotary shaker at 180 r.p.m., thereby obtaining a seed culture. In a 300 ml flask for shaking, was introduced 100 ml of H II culture medium and after subjecting the flask to sterilization in autoclave for 20 min at 1200C followed by cooling the flask containing the medium to 30 C, 3 ml of the prepared seed culture were inoculated to the sterilized culture medium in the flask and the inoculum was subjected to shaking culture for 4 days at 300C while placing the flask on a rotary shaker of 180 r.p.m. The obtained cultured matter was adjusted to pH 6.0 and after adding potassium cyanide in an amount to make the final concentration of KCN in the mixture to 0.01 by weight, the mixture was treated in autoclave for 20 min at 1200C under a pressure of 1.2 kg cm2. After cooling to room temperature, the cooled mixture was subjected to centrifugal separation to obtain a supernatant liquid. On quantitatively determining the amount of vitaminB12 in the cultured matter by the microbiological method while using Lactobacillus leichmannii, it was found that the cultured matter contained 10 mg of vitamin B12 per one litre thereof. Isolation and purification of vitamin B12 produced and accumulated in the cultured matter were carried out as follows after transforming vitamin B12 to cyanocobalamin CN vitamin B12 by addition of potassium cyanide thereto. Two litres of the cultured matter were subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C at 8000 r.p.m. to obtain the bacterial bodies and the supernatant liquid. To the separated bacterial bodies, was added one litre of 80 aqueous ethanolic solution that is, a mixture of 80 by weight of ethanol and 20 by weight of water containing 0.01 of potassium cyanide and the resultant mixture was stirred at 1000C to extract vitamin B12 with the ethanolic solution.The resultant mixture was subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C and at 8000 r.p.m., thereby obtaining a liquid ethanol extract. After condensing the liquid ethanol extract at 400C under a reduced pressure, and the pH of the residual liquid was adjusted to 4.0. The adjusted residual liquid was subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C and at 8000 r.p.m. to remove the impurities contained in the residual extract. The supernatant liquid which was an aqueous solution containing vitamin B12 at a high concentration was treated as follows. After passing the supernatant liquid through a column packed with Dowex1 X 2 C1 made by Dow Chemical Co. , the liquid passed through the column was adjusted to pH 4.0 and was passed through a column packed with activated carbon to adsorb vitamin B12 by the activated carbon. After washing the column packed with activated carbon with water, vitamin B12 adsorbed thereon was eluted by 70 aqueous acetonic solution that is, a mixture of 70 by weight of acetone and 30 by weight of water . After distilling acetone from the eluted solution, the residual liquid was adjusted to pH 9.0 and was treated by passing through another column packed with Dowex 1 x 2 C1 Then, potassium cyanide was added to the liquid passed through the Dowex column and after adjusting the pH of the resultant mixture to 9.0, the adjusted liquid was further passed through still another Dower X 2 C1 column to adsorb di cyanocobalamin.After washing the column with water, the column was treated by a mixture of 0.1N hydrochloric acid and acetone 6 4 by volume to elute cyanocobalamin adsorbed on the column. After condensing the eluate, acetone was added to the condensate and then, 16 mg of cyanocobalamin was obtained as crystals. Another method for isolating cyanocobalamin from the cultured matter is set forth below. Two litres of the cultured matter were subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C at 8000 r.p.m. to obtain the bacterial bodies and the supernatant liquid. To the separated bacterial bodies, was added one litre of 80 aqueous ethanolic solution that is, a mixture of 80 by weight of ethanol and 20 by weight of water containing 0.01 of potassium cyanide and the resultant mixture was stirred at 1000C to extract vitamin B12 with the ethanolic solution. The resultant mixture was subjected to cetrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C and at 8000 r.p.m., thereby obtaining a liquid ethanol extract. After condensing the liquid ethanol extract at 400C under a reduced pressure, the pH of the residual liquid was adjusted to 4.0. The adjusted residual liquid was subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 50C and at 8000 r.p.m. to remove the impurities contained in the residual extract. The supernatant liquid which was an aqueous solution containing vitamin B12 at a high concentration was treated as follows. After passing the supernatant liquid through a column packed with Dowex 1 X 2 C1 made by Dow Chemical Co. , the liquid passed through the column was adjusted to pH 4.0 and was passed through the column packed with activated carbon to adsorb vitamin B12 by the activated carbon. After washing the column packed with activated carbon with water, vitamin B12 adsorbed thereon was eluted by 70 aqueous acetonic solution that is, a mixture of 70 8 by weight of acetone and 30 by weight of water . After distilling acetone from the eluted solution, the residual liquid was subjected to extraction with 50 ml of a mixture of p chlorophenol and chloroform 2 3 by volume . After washing the extract with 2 times by volume of water, 100 ml of a mixture of p chlorophenol, n butanol and water 1 1 1 by volume were added to the washed extract. The formed mixture was shaken to transfer vitamin B12 from the organic layer to the aqueous layer.After washing the aqueous layer with chloroform and then with diisopropyl ether, the aqueous layer was condensed and thereafter, acetone was added to the condensate and then, 16 mg of cyanocobalamin was obtained as crystals.2 2 Production of Methylcobalamin CH3 B12 Isolation and purification of vitamin B12 in the form as it has been formed in the cultured matter were carried out in the dark without adding cyanide ions to the cultured matter as follows After subjecting 2 litres of a cultured matter obtained by the same procedures as above to centrifugal separation into the bacterial bodies and the supernatant liquid, one litre of 80 aqueous ethanolic solution that is, a mixture of 80 by weight of ethanol and 20 by weight of water was added to the separated bacterial bodies, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min at 1000C to extract vitamin B12 in the bacterial bodies with ethanol. After adding 200 ml of a mixture of p chlorophenol and chloroform 2 3 by volume to the ethanolic extract liquid, the obtained mixture was shaken. The mixture was left to stand still, the underlaying p chlorophenol layer was washed with a small amount of water and after adding the same volume of a mixture of chloroform, n butanol and water 1 1 1 to the p chlorophenol layer, the mixture was shaken and then was left to stand still. Vitamin B12 was transferred from the p chlorophenol layer to the aqueous layer, thereby obtaining a concentrated aqueous solution of vitamin B12. After washing the aqueous solution with a small amount of chloroform and then with isopropyl ether, the pH of the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH of 3.5, and the aqueous solution was passed through a column packed with AmberliteIRC 50 made by Pohm Haas Co., USA and the column was eluted with at first a small amount of water and then with an aqueous ammonia solution of pH 9.5 to obtain a fraction containingDBCC and methylcobalamin also called as CH3 B12 . After purifying the obtained fraction by the same procedures as above of using p chlorophenol, DBCC and CH 3 B12 were separated by column chromatography while using CM cellulose. By adding acetone to the respective eluates, 10 mg of DBCC and 6 mg of CH3 B12 were obtained both as crystals.EXAMPLE 3 In a 30 litre jar type fermentor, were introduced 20 litres of a culture medium which was prepared by dissolving, in each one litre of de ionized water, 30 g of glucose, 10 g of polypeptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 1.5 g of urea, 1.5 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 1.5 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.1 g of calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.1 g of zinc sulfate heptahydrate, 0.1 g of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.01 g of manganese sulfate heptahydrate, 0.1 g of cobalt chloride hexahydrate and 0.2 ml of ADEKANOL LG 126 made by Asahi Denka Kogyo Co. as an antifoaming agent. The culture medium was sterilized for 30 min at 120 C under a pressue of 1.2 kg cmêG. After cooling the culture medium to room temperature, a seed culture prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was inoculated to the sterilized culture medium at a volume rate of 2 , and the microorganism, of the present invention was cultured at 300C for 72 hours while stirring the culture medium at 350 r.p.m., while carring out an aeration at a rate of 10 litres min and automatically regulating the pH of the culture medium in a range from 7.0 to 7.5 by 14 aqueous ammonia solution. It was found that the formation of vitamin B12 during 72 hours of aerobic culture was 44 mg litre of the culture medium. The cultured matter was subjected to centrifugal separation for 20 min at 8000 r.p.m. at 50C into the bacterial bodies and the supernatant liquid. Thereafter, the bacterial bodies were suspended in 10 litres of 80 aqueous ethanolic solution containing 0.01 by weight of potassium cyanide and vitamin B12 was extracted while stirring the ethanolic solution for 20 min at 100 C. After cooling the mixture, it was subjected to centrifugal separation and the extraction residue was subjected to extraction in the same manner as above. After combining the two liquid extracts, the combined liquid extract was condensed under a reduced pressure to evaporate ethanol from the extract.After adjusting the pH of the condensate to 4.0, the condensate was subjected to centrifugation to remove the precipitated matter. Thereafter, the obtained supernatant liquid was treated with 400 g of activated carbon and after washing the activated carbon with water, the absorbed matter on the activated carbon was eluted with 75 aqueous acetonic solution that is, a mixture of 75 by weight of acetone and 25 by weight of water . After condensing the eluate under a reduced pressure and adjusting the pH of the condensate to 4.0, the condensate was passed through a column packed with 200 g of an strongly basic anion exchange resin, Dowel6 1 X 2 C1 , which had been adjusted to be Cl type. The passed liquid was passed through the column packed with 200 g of AmberliteO IRC 50 which had been adjusted to pH of 3.5 with aqueous 0.1N hydrochloric acid solution to adsorb vitamin B12. After washing the column with a small amount of water, the substance adsorbed on the column was eluted by aqueous ammonia solution of pH 9.0 to collect the fraction containing vitamin B12. After neutralizing the collected fraction containing vitamin B12 with aqueous 0.2N hydrochloric acid solution, the neutralized fraction was passed through a new column packed with activated carbon to adsorb vitamin B12. After washing the activated carbon column with water, the column was treated with 75 aqueous acetonic solution to elute vitamin B12. By condensing the eluate under a reduced pressure, acetone was distilled off from the eluate so as to obtain an aqueous solution containing vitamin B12 at a high concentration. Thereafter, acetone was added to the condensate and 650 mg of vitamin B12 as crystals was obtained. On the other hand, the supernatant liquid which had been separated from the cultured matter was condensed to dryness, and vitamin B12 was extracted therefrom by the same procedures of extracting vitamin B12 from the bacterial bodies. After purification thereof, 160 mg of vitamin B12 were obtained as crystals. In short, from 20 litres of the cultured matter ofRhodopseudomonas protamicus, 810 mg of vitamin B12 cyanocobalamin, referred to as CN B12 was obtained 40.5 mg of CN B12 one litre of the cultured matter . The purity of the thus obtained vitamin B12 was higher than 99.0 according to the determination by liquidchromatographic method, spectrocalorimetric method and the microbiological method while using Lactobacillus leichmannii.EXAMPLE 4 In a 30 litre jar type fermentor, were introduced 20 litres of a culture medium which was prepared by dissolving, in each one litre of de ionized water, 50 g of glucose, 20 g of polypeptone, 30 g of yeast extract, 3 g of urea, 3 g of ammonium sulfate, 3 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 3 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.6 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.2 g of calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.2 g of zinc sulfate heptahydrate, 0.2 g of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.02 g of manganese sulfate heptahydrate, 0.2 g of cobalt chloride hexahydrate and 0.4 ml of ADEKANO g as an antifoaming agent.After sterilizing the culture medium in a same manner as in Example 3 and cooling the sterilized culture medium to room temperature, a seed culture prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 was inoculated to the culture medium and was cultured in the same manner as in Example 3 except for the duration of culture of 90 hours in Example 3. By extracting and purifying the cultured matter in the same manner as in Example 3, 2.7 g of vitamin B12 cyanocobalamin, referred to CN B12 were obtained. The yield corresponds to 135 mg of CN B12 one litre of the cultured matter and 2.7 mg of CN B12 one gram of dried bacterial bodiesEXAMPLE 5 After preparing a culture medium in the same manner as in Example 2, a preliminarily cultured Rhodopseudomonas protamicus was inoculated to the prepared culture medium as a seed culture and in the same time, the sterilized and cooled liquid paraffin was placed on the liquid surface of the culture medium so as to make a layer of 1 cm in thickness. Thereafter, a stationary and anaerobic culture was carried out at 300C for 7 days while exposing the culture medium to a light from a luminescent lamp at a height of 30 cm above from the surface of the culture medium. After ending culturing, liquid paraffin was removed, and the cultured matter was treated in the same manner as inExample 2 to obtain vitamin B12 at a rate of 8.2 mg one litre of the cultured matter.
