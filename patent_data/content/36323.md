# Apparatus for use in a solar heating system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for use in a solar heating system comprising a collector, including a housing 50 having spaced ends. Means 72,74 are provided within the housing 50 for defining a cavity capable of holding a heat transfer fluid. A light absorb ing surface 82 is presented toward the light transmitting sheet on the housing for absorbing heat. A supply pipe 86 and a drain pipe 86 extend from one end of the housing to the other end and are accessible from each end of the housing 50 The drain pipe 86 communicates with the cavity at a region thereof that is remote from the region at which the supply pipe communicates with the cavity. A manifold 11 includes a pressure pipe 136 having a supply fitting 146 , a return pipe 138 alongside the pressure pipe 136 ans a drain fitting 150 . First and second coupling means 106,154 are provided for connecting the supply pipe 86 and supply fitting 146 and the drain pipe 86 and drain fitting 150 respec tively.
