In addition, it is preferable to have the bottom of endless belt 2530 supported by a plurality of idle rollers not shown. SECTION 6 THE RESAWING AND SHEARING N 3 MEANS The refuse disposed after the above sections will have a higher density and thus is not capable of being easily dried, preheated or burnt. Thus, it need be made into smaller ones.As shown in Fig. 8, the refuse conveyed by conveyor 2501, through a guiding piece 2602, is to be resawed by a resawing means 26 which can have the structure as that of sawing means 23 to have a first shaft 2603, a first drum 2601, a second shaft 2606, a second drum 2605 and a plurality of circular sawing tools 2604.A shearing means 262 according to the present invention can include a lower shearing tool 2622, an upper shearing tool 2621 capable of cooperating with lower shearing tool 2622 to shear the refuse after being resawed by resawing means 26, a pressing plate 2623 springly attached to upper shearing tool 2621 for pressing the refuse against lower shearing tool 2622 when upper shearing tool 2621 is to cooperate with lower shearing tool 2622 to shear the refuse, a hydraulic cylinder 2615 having a plunger capable of being in a first position when upper and lower shearing tools 2621 2622 cooperate to shear the refuse and in a second position when upper shearing tool 2621 separates from lower shearing tool 2622 and a cushioning conveying mechanism 2610, having a first end pivotally fixed at a position near lower shearing tool 2622 and a second end connected to the plunger, for conveying the refuse after re sawn to be sheared by shearing means 262 wherein the differential amount of the refuse between sawing means 26 and shearing means 262 when the plunger is in the first and second positions respectively is that which will be sheared by shearing means 262 at a time. A microswitch and a solenoid valve can be incorporated here to implement thu ion of hydraulic cylinder 2615 with respect to upper shearing tool 2621.Cushioning conveying mechanism 2610 can include rollers 2611 having coaxial sprockets 2612 upon which a chain 2613 is engaging powered by a driven shaft 2614 which also acts as a pivotal end of mechanism 2610.The refuse obtained after disposed by this section can have a length from about 20 cm to about 50 cm and a crosseection area from about 3 square cm to about S square cm.SECTION 7 THE DISTRIBUTING MEANSNormally, if possible, it is preferable to incinerate the refuse as much as possible. Thus, the drying means should be wider than conveyor 2501. In turn, it is necessary to have a distributing means for distributing the refuse 2624 after resawed and sheared into the drying means.As shown in Figs. 9 9A, 2 distributing means 27 according to the present invention includes an inclined distributing trough 2701 having the top thereof pivotally fixed on a pin 2702 secured beneath the bottom of lower shearing tool 2622 for receiving therefrom refuse 2624 and having a longitudinal groove 2707 at the bottom side of the upper portion thereof., a rotating disk 2705 driven, through a reduction gear box 2704, by a motor 2703 and a pin 2706 secured to rotating disk 2705 and capable of engaging in longitudinal groove 2707 so that when rotating disk 2705 rotates the lower end of distributing trough 2701 will oscillate within a particular range. Thus, refuse 2624 will be distributed to a storage space 3101 of the drying means uniformly. CHAPTER 2 INCINERATIONMaterials in refuse 2624 have those which have a high calorific power, e.g. the oiled rag, those which have a moderate calorific power, e.g. the bamboo or the household plastic manufacture and those which have a low calorific power, e.g. the paper. Since the household plastic manufacture has a low melting point, in drying refuse 2fez4 in the drying means, the drying means should be kept at a temperature not higher than the melting point in order not to impede the drying of refuse 2624 which will, otherwise, be enclosed by the molten plastics.This chapter contains three sections to be described, i.e. 1 the drying and preheating means 2 the burning means and 3 the controls of temperature as well as putting off and starting the fire.SECTION 1 THE DRYING AND PREHEATING MEANSConsidering the melting point of the plastics and the avoidance of the expensive heat resisting steel, it becomes apparent that it is preferable to dry refuse 2624 at a temperature lower than the melting point of household plastics.As shown in Figs. 10 10A lOC, a drying means 31 according to the present invention can include a drying chamber having an upper drying chamber 3130, through an adjustable gate 3102, receiving refuse 2624 from storage space 3101 and a lower drying chamber 3140 and a gratelike member disposed in the drying chamber for separating upper drying chamber 3130 from lower drying chamber 3140, carrying refuse 2624 thereon to be dried by the flue gas coming from the preheating and burning means as will be described later and having a plurality of openings 3118 for passing the flue gas from upper drying chamber 3130 into lower drying chamber 3140. Grate like member 3110 can include a plurality of rods 3111, sleeves 3112 coaxially mounting therein rode 3111 respectively, pairs of outer check plates 3113, pairs of inner check plates 3114, pairs of rollers 3115 respectively mounted on rods 3111 and embraced by plates 3114 3113, nuts 3115 respectively screwed on rods 3111, sets of grate like pieces 3117 respectively attached to sleeves 3112 and having openings 3118, sets of grate like piece clips 3120, sets of screws 3121 fastening together grate like pieces 3117 and grate like piece clips 3120 respectively, and a pair of rails 3119 rotating thereon rollers 3115.Drying means 31 can have a casing 3103, walls 3104 built of refractory bricka, a temperature gauge 3131 and a vacuum gauge 3132. Grate like member 3110 is conveyed by a conveying chain engaged with an active sprocket 312B powered by a transmission sprocket 3127, through a reduction gear box 3126, driven by a variable speed motor 3125. A preheating means 315 according to the present invention can include a preheating chamber 3150 connected to upper drying chamber 3130 for preheating refuse 2624 before which is to be burnt in the burning means by the heat of the exhaust gas obtained from the burning means and mount at the top wall thereof a steam superheater 3208. The material to be used in the region 3151 between upper drying chamber 3130 and the bottom of preheating chamber 3150 must be heat resisting and abrasion resistant since the structure built here must urge against grate like pieces 3117 in order not to fall refuse 2624 into lower drying chamber 3140. In addition, the structure can be hollow and circulated width cool water to be cooled.Concurrently referring to Figs. 11 1IA referred to the burning means as will be detailedly described later, the exhaust gas coming from the combustion chamber 3202 behind the water wall 3205 of a steam evaporator 3203 built in the burning means will directly pass through preheating chamber 3150 to preheat and dry refuse 2624 again and the flue gas coming from combustion chamber 3202 before water wall 3205 and the hot gas tube 3214 from the No. 1 No. 2 ash cars 3216 will pass through the fire tubes 3204 of steam evaporator 3203 to generate steam and go ahead to pass through the fire tubes 3219 of steam superheater 3208 to improve the dryness of the steam therein.After passing through steam superheater 3208, the flue gas still bears a high temperature and thus need to be mixed with the cool air coming from the cool air tube 3153 air supplied by an air blower 3152 to get a hot gas having a lowered temperature for drying refuse 2624 in drying means 31. Refuse 2624 dried in upper drying chamber 3130 will increase in volume. The hot gas after drying refuse 2624 in upper drying chamber 3130 will pass, through openings 3118, into lower drying chamber 3140 to be extracted, through intakes C 3164 of a manifold 3163, by a gas extracter 3160, through a transmission belt 3161, driven by a variable speed motor 3162 to a gas exit tube 3165.It i5 possible that refuse 2624 of small size will fall, through openings 3118 and region 3151, down into the bottom of lower drying chamber 3140 which is downwardly convergent. A drag chain conveyor 3170 mounted at the bottom for carrying refuse 2624 thereon to a place, near the active sprocket 3171 thereof, where refuse 2624 falls, through a rotary valve 3172, into a pneumatic conveyor tube 3173 for being sent to storage space 3101 by a gas blower 3174.SECTION 2 THE BURNING MEANG Refuse 2624 is now ready to be burnt.A burning means 32, as shown in Figs. 11 llA, according to the present invention can include combustion chamber 3202 a chain grate stoker 3201 mounted in combustion chamber 3202 for conveying refuse 2624 and steam generator 3203 mounted in combustion chamber 3202 for generating steam by the heat of the flue gas obtained from combustion chamber 3202.Refuse 2624 in chain grate stoker 3201 will burn with the required air coming from the primary air supplied, through an air tube 3211, by an air blower 3210 powered by a motor 3209 and coming from the secondary air intake 3212. Thus, the thickness of refuse 2624 on chain grate stoker 3201 will become smaller and smaller.Finally, at the rear portion of combustion chamber 3202, refuse 2624 is nearly fully burnt and remains only those which are difficult to oxidize and non combustible, e.g. the meat, the bone...etc., which do not have a large amount, will not be oxidized on chain grate stoker 3201 to reduce costs and will fall, through an exit 3213, to the ash car 3Z16. The exhaust gas in combustion chamber 3202 before water wall 3205 will heat and pass along the steam tube 3206, the outer surface of steam superheater 3208 and refuse 2624 in preheating chamber 3150.The flue gas in combustion chamber 3202 behind water wall 3205 will heat the lower portion of steam generator 3203 and mix with the secondary air to get into fire tubes 3204. The difficult to oxidize residue in ash car 3216 will continue to oxidize with the required air coming from a blower 3217. The hot gas thus obtained will, through a casing 3215 and a hot gas tube .3214, get into fire tubes 3204. At the space between steam generator 3203 and steam superheater 3208, the hot gas coming from ash car 3216 and tha exhaust gas coming from combustion chamber 3202 behind the water wall 3205 will mix together and enter into hot gas tubes 3219 to improve the dryness of the steam of steam superheater 3208.After passing through fire tubes 3219, the hot gas will mix together with the hot gas coming from combustion chamber 3202 before wator wall 3205. The hot gas thus obtained will mix with the cool air to enter into upper drying chamber 3130 as has been described above. When ash car 3216 is fully loaded, a second ash car will replace its position.The first and second ash cars should be regarded as a portion of combustion chamber 3202 because they are oxidizing the difficult to oxidize residue therein. The hot gas resulted by burning the organic materials generally has the odor and can pollute the air if directly discharged to the atmosphere. Thus, it is most preferable to guide the hot gas, through casing 3215, hot gas tube 3214, fire tubea 3204, drying chambers 3130 BR 3140 and gas extracter 3160, to be water scrubbed as will be described later before emitted to the atmosphere. Chain grate stoker 2301 is conveyed by an active sprocket 3222 which is driven, through a reduction gear box 3221, by a motor 3220 which must be speed variable in order to set a speed according to the nature of refuse 2624, and rotates the passive sprocket 3223. Passive sprocket 3223 should be connected to a hydraulic cylinder not shown for adjusting the space between water wall 3205 and refuse 2624.The water needed in steam generator 3203 is supplied by a feedwater pump 3218. The superheated steam generated by steam superheater 3208 is conveyed by a steam tube 3207.SECTION 3 THE CONTROLS OF TEMPERATURE AND PUTTING OFF AND STARTING OF FIREThe calorific power of refuse is different according to its nature, Thus, the temperature in related means need be controlled in order to secure a smooth operation Of the present apparatus. This section will be described with reference to Figs. 12 12A.If the temperature of combustion chamber 3202 is too high, the flowrate, the temperature and the pressure resulted In steam generator 3203 will increase to possibly incur a danger. Thus, steam exit 3207 should be fitted with a steam flow meter, a temperature gauge and a pressure gauge all of which should be set with respective upper and lower limits. If upper lower limit is approached, the speed Of motor 3220 should be increased decreased to reduce increase the time refuse 2624 stays in combustion chamber 3202 and the rotating speed of blower 3217 should be reduced increased .Temperature gauge 3131 should also be set with an upper limit, which, e.g., can be set at a temperature lower than the sum of the melting point of the household plastics and the temperature difference between the measuring point and gauge 3131, and a lower limit which can be set by considering the average water content, the specific heat and the thickness of refuse 2624, the conveyed speed of refuse 2634, the length and width of upper drying chamber 3130...etc. If the upper lower limit is approached, the amount of the air from secondary air intake 3212 is increased decreased . If not enough effective, the speed of blower 3217 is decreased increased .If still not sufficiently effective, the rotating speed of motor 3152 is increased decreased to increase decrease the amount of the cool air, through air tube 3153, supplied to upper drying chamber 3130.Upon putting off the fire in combustion chamber 3202, the following steps can be adopted 1 reducing the amount of the air coming from secondary air intake 3212 2 stopping motor 312sot 3 fully and slowly burning refuse 2624 in combustion chamber 3202 and adjusting the air amount coming from blower 3152 to fully dry refuse 2624 in upper drying chamber 3130 to be capable of being fired easily the next time 4 stopping blower 3210 5 stopping motor 3220 and blower 3217 6 stopping blower 3152 and motor 3162 7 fully closing secondary air intake 3212 and 8 fully closing the chokers 4205 4221 as shown in Figs. 15 15A. Upon starting the fire in combustion chamber 3202, the following steps can be adopted 1 starting air extracter 3160 and blower 3217 and opening choker 4205 2 starting igniting with the aid of the hot air tube 3303, the burner 3301 and the blower 3302 driven by a motor 3304 supported on a frame 3305 3 starting motors 3125, 3209 3220 immediately after the temperature shown on temperature gauge 3131 abruptly raises several degrees which shows that refuse 2624 in upper drying chamber 3130 is fired 4 opening secondary air intake 3212 and starting blower 3152 5 opening choker 4221 6 starting feedwater pump 3218, and 7 adjusting the amount of the air supplied by blower 3152.Certainly, the above described controls can all be computerized. CHAPTER 3 POST IUCINERA ION DISPOSAL Tt has been described above that the difficult to oxidize residue will be oxidized in the ash cars, which is necessary in order to reduce the weight of the ash.Since the ash is very light, the air amount coming from the blowers for the ash cars except the first and second ones should be smaller in order not to carry the ash into the stack to pollute the atmosphere. Certainly, the number of the ash cars Is to be determined by the quantity of the difficult to oxidize residue.This chapter will be described in three sections 1 the ash car and its rails 2 the oxidization and utilization of the difficult to oxidize residue and 3 the ashunloading means.SECTION 1 THE ASH CAR AND ITS RAILS Aah car 3216 will be renumbered as 4100 in this chapter.As shown in Figs. 13 13A 13D, an oxidizing means 41 according to the present invention can be a plurality of ash cars 4100 being a container 4106 having an open top, an air intake 4114, a casing 4107 and refractory bricks 4108. Each ash car 4100 includes a bottom frame 4101 having a front piece 4105, a rear piece 4104 and axles 4103 mounted thereon wheels 4102, a bottom plate 4110 attached thereon grAte bars 4111 and having a front end pivotally connected to container 4106 by a pin 4109 pinning therethrough at a place near front piece 4105 and 8 rear end and a retaining piece 4112 springly connected to container 4106 near rear piece 4104 by a tension spring 4113 such that when retaining piece is externally applied a force the rear end is capable of being released by retaining piece 4112 and thus the rear end will fall down to unload the ash contained in container 4106, and when bottom plate 4110 is externally applied a force to upwardly urge against retaining piece 4112 the rear end is capable of rubbing against and through retaining piece 4112 to be retained thereon when the externally applied force is removed.As shown in Figs. 14, 14A 14B, the rails for ash cars 4100 can include a pair of inner rails 4140 and a pair of outer rails 4160. Inner rails 4140 include a pair of flat rails 4141 having a level line 4146, a pair of inclined ash car progressing rails 4142 having a first end connected to an end of flat rails 4141 and a second end and having a length capable of carrying thereon a plurality of ash cars 4100 and a pair of horizontal rails 4143 having a third end connected to the second end and a fourth end connected to a stopping frame 4145 and being lower than the first end.A conveyor 4151 is secured at the middle portion 4 of inclined ash car progressing rails 4142 and spacedly attached thereon a plurality of pulling pieces 4152 each of which is capable of engaging with bottom frame 4101 at a cushion plate 4115 to pull forward the respective ash car when which is fully loaded with the ash and the difficult to oxidize residue. Every adjacent two pulling pieces 4152 can be spaced with 1.05L where L is the length of an ash car 4100. Outer rails 4160 include a pair of inclined ash car returning rails 4161 juxtaposed with inclined ash car progressing rails 4142 and having a fifth end and a sixth end and a pair of crossover rails 4162 having a seventh end connected to horizontal rails 4143 and a eighth end connected to the sixth end The centerline 4147 of combustion chamber 3202 is also shown. Conveyor 4151 can be a chain guided by a flat piece 4153 and an inclined piece 4154 and conveyed by an active sprocket 4155, driven by a motor 4156, and a passive sprocket 4157. After ash car 4100 descending through the height difference H between the fifth end and the sixth end and impacting against a reactive piece 4144 springly attached to stopping frame 4145, it can automatically return to inclined ash car progressing rails 4142 as will be e described in more details later When ash car 4100 is to be fully loaded with the ash and thedificult to oxidize residue if the refuse amount to be burnt in combustion chamber 3202 has been suitably adjusted to be constant, a timer can be used , the lower end of ash and difficult to oxidize exit 3213 is raised upwardly to temporarily collect the ash and the difficult to oxidize residue thereon. Then, motor 4156 is started to move conveyor 4151 a distance of l.05L. Then, the lower end of exit 3213 is repositloned to discharge therefrom the ash and the difficult to oxidize residue to the succeeding ash car. Then, close the choker 4208 and raise the choker 4205 as shown in Figs.15 15A ae will be described later. These operations, which, certainly, can be computerized, however can also be performed by using the microswitch, the magnetic switch and the hydraulic cylinder to reduce costs.Ash car 4100 after pulled to falt rails 4141 by a pulling piece 4152 will separate therefrom and go toward the rails 4301 of a transferring truck 4300 by the inertial force thereof as will be described later.SECTION 2 THE OXIDIZATION AND UTILIZATION OF THE DIFFICULT TO OXIDIZE RESIDUEThe difficult to oxidize residue oxidizes in ash car 4100 with the aid of the air supplied, through air intake 4114 and grate bars 4111 by blower 3217 and the hot gas thus obtained goes to fire tubes 3204 through casing 3215 and tube 3214.Referring to Figs, 15 15A, when the first ash car 3216 is fully loaded, it will be conveyed forwardly to be the second ash car 3216, and then to be the third, fourth, fifth... ash car 4100. The air supplied by blowers 4201 for ash cars 4100 after the second ash car should be reduced orderly. The bottom of the top casings 4202 for any one of the second to fifth ash cars 4100 should be provided a dusting net 4203 to prevent the dust contained in the hot gas resulted by ash cars 4100 from being discharged from the main stack 4225. If the second ash car still have organic materials to oxidize therein, then, choker 4208 should be closed and choker 4205 should be opened.The exhaust gas thus obtained will, through a hot gas manifold 4204, casing 3215 and tube 3214, enter into fire tubes 3204. If the second ash car has no organic materials to oxIdize therein or has oxidized therein the organic materials, choker 4208 is raised up and choker 4205 is lowered down, throngh the medium of wires 4207, by e motor 4206. Now, the hot gas coming from the second to fifth ash cars will through manifold 4204, a choker 4221 and a main 4220 enter into a reheater 4222 which includes a plurality of compartments each of which mixes therein the hot gas coming from main 4220 and the water scrubbed cooled hot gas coming, through a tube 4224. from the water scrubbing means as wi.ll.be described later with the former positioned lower than the latter to obtain a hot gas having an averaged temperature to be discharged from stack 42sus. Since the height of which is determined by the averaged temperature, it is preferable to have tubes anywhere applied the temperature retaining agent 4210 and the inner surface of stack 4225 paved with refractory bricks 4226. After putting off the fire in combustion chamber 3202, choker 4221 is closed to prevent the difficult to oxidize residue in the ash car 4100 from being fully oxidized to reserve it as the kindling for starting fire the next time.SECTION 3 THE ASH UNLOADING MEANSAs shown in Figs. 16 16A 16D, an ash unloadlng means 43 according to the present invent ion can include a transferring truck 4300 capable of carrying thereon ash car 4100 to be ash unloaded coming from flat rails 4141 and a pair of transferring rails 4308 for transporting thereon transferting truck 4300 from where transferring truck 4300 is adjacent to flat rails 4141 to where adjacent to the fifth end for releasing ash car 4100 to the fifth end so that ash car 4100 is capable of descending from inclined ash car returning rails 4161, through horizontal rails 4143, to return to inclined ash car progressing rails 4142.This happens when rear pierce 4104 impacts against reactive piece 4144 and the reaction force thus resulted can urge ash car 4100 to run, through horizontal rails 4143, over a height difference h to have cushion piece 4115 engaged with pulling piece 4152 as shown in Figs. 1Q 14A and to impact upon the first ash car 3216 to stop there.When front piece 4105 of ash car 4100 on rails 4301 secured on a securing frame 4303 of transferring truck 4300 impacts upon an air cylinder 4320 secured on a securing frame 4302 of transferring truck 4300, through a microswitch contact and an electromagnectic valve not shown , a plunger piston 4321 of cylinder 4320 will inwardly move into cylinder 4320 to deform a linkage 4322 which, in turn, deforms a pair of scissors type clips 4323 integrally connected thereon to firmly clip front piece 4105. Piston 4321 continues to inwardly move to aecure ash car 4100 on transferring truck 4300.When piston 4321 is fully received in cylinder 4320r wheels 4102 will contact a microewitch not shown which results that an air cylinder 4304 mounted on securing frame 4303 will push retaining piece 4112 to fall down bottom plate 4110, which pivots about pin 4109 to unload the ash contained therein. Meanwhile, two shower heads 4305 jet high pressure water in order not to raise a terrible dust. Cylinder 4304 will automatically recover. After falling, bottom plate 4110 is cushioned by cushioning spring 4306 to alleviate the impact force upon transferring truck 4300 and the supporting frame thereof 4307. When dust is calm, shower heads 4305 shut off. Now, an air cylinder 4330 mounted at securing piece 4302 is activated to have the plunger piston thereof urged against a supporting point 41L6 on bottom plate 4110 to pivotally upwardly raise bottom plate 4110 to be retained by retaining piece 4112. Certainly, cylinder 4330 pivots against a supporting point 4331 and has a front end fixed to i wire 4340. As the front end fixing wire 4340 gets higher, through pulleys 4341 4342, the weight 4343 will be lowered along a guiding plate 4344 secured on securing piece 4302. When bottom plate 4110 is retained by retaining piece 4112, the plunger piston of cylinder 4330 reaches its top dead point. At this time, a microewitch not shown will have the plunger piston of cylinder 4330 retracted in cylinder 4330.Thus, cylinder 4330 will separate from supporting point 4116 and immediately fall down. Because the provision of weight 4343, the falling speed of cylinder 4330 will not be too high. When cylinder 4330 is to reach its original position, weight 4343 impact upon a spring 4345 provided on securing piece 4302 to be cushioned. Thus, the ash unloading work is performed.Now, two air cylinders 4320 mounted on a securing piece 4309 secured on the top side1 viewed fromFig. 16, of supporting frame 4307 will push a first axle 4310 of transferring truck 4300, i.e. wheels 4311 of transferring truck 4300 will move on transferring rails 4308 so that transferring truck 4300 is transported from a place where it is adjacent to flat rails 4141 to a place adjacent to the fifth end where a second axle 4310 of transferring truck 4300 is clipped by two air cylinders 4320 mounted on a securing piece 4309 secured on the lower side, viewed with respect to Fig. 16, of supporting frame 4307.Subsequently, cylinder 4320 mounted on securing piece 4302 will push front piece 4105Of ash car 4100 and then release ash car 4100 to the fifth end of inclined ash car returning rails 416t to return to inclined ash car progressing rails 4142 as described above.After ash car 4100 leaves transferring truck 4300, cylinders 4320 mounted on securing piece 4309 will push transferring truck 4300 to return to the place adjacent to flat rails 4141 for ready to be on duty again. CHAPTER 4 THE DISPOSALS OF THE EXHAUST GA81 THE FILTHY WATER AND THE ASHAfter mixed with the cool air supplied by blower 3152, the flue gas resulted in combustion chamber 3202 is used to dry refuse 2624 in upper drying chamber 3130. The hot exhaust gas extracted from lower drying chamber 3140 by gas extracter 3160 is thus very dirty and filthy and thus should be water scrubbed before discharged to the atmosphere The filthy water coming from the waterscrubbing means can be concentrated by the steam coming from steam tube 3207 to become a liquid fertilizer to be mixed with the ash to obtain a compost.This chapter will be described in three sections 1 the water scrubbing means 2 the filthy water treating means and 3 the disposal of the ash.SECTION 1 THE WATER SCRUBBING MEANSThe hot gas coming from gas. extracter 3160 contains therein not only the dust but also refuse 2624 not combusted of small sloe. In addition to water scrubbing the hot gas, It is necessary to separate refuse 2624 not combusted from the hot gas. It is necessary to separate the water beads and the water particles contained in the water scrubbed hot gas from the hot gas. The waterscrubbed hot gas having a lowered temperature need be reheated as has been described in Section 2 in Chapter 3.Thus, the broad interpretation of the water scrubbing means according to the present invention should contain the following functions 1 water scrubbing the hot gas 2 separating refuse 2624 not combusted 3 separating the water beads and the water particles from the hot gas and 4 reheating the hot gas water scrubbed.A water scrubbing means 5100 according to the present invention, as shown in Figs. 17 17A 17C, can include an exhaust gas intake 5102 receiving exhaust gas coming from gas extractor 3160, a casing 5101 bigger than intake 5102 by several times to reduce the speed of the hot gas therein, a hot gas exit 5104, a water outlet 5105, a dust scrubber 511 for separating the dust contained in the exhaust gas by meeting the hot gas with a water, a disturbing room 5103 larger than dust scrubber 511 in volume to reduce the flowing speed of exhaust gas therein coming from dust scrubber 511, for further mixing the exhaust gas with the water coming from dust scrubber 5110 and separating the exhaust gas from the water, a dust collecter S130 for passing the hot gas and retaining thereon the dust in and the water beads formed in the hot gas coming from disturbing room 5103 and a water strainer 5150 for retaining thereon the water particles in the hot gas coming through dust collector 5130.Dust scrubber 511 includes at least one set of tubes 5110 which can be, e.ga, either one of the two sets of tubes enclosed by the two dotted linea as shown in Pig. 17A, is externally water pressurized and includes a plurality of tubes 5111 each of which includes a plurality of through holes 5117 which are distributed along a threadlike path an the external surface of each tube 5111 and each hole 5117 has an axis parallel to one of the diameter of each tube 5111 with the distance therebetween ranged from about 0.25R to about 0.75R wherein R is the radius of each tube 5111.Set of tubes 5110 is included and supported by a top plate 5114, a bottom plate 5115, two side plates 5113, two end plates 5112 having holes passing tubes 5111 and a water inlet tube 5116, mounted on top plate S114, for water pressuring set of tubes 5110. Thus, by the water, through holes 5117 jetting into tubes 5111 meeting with the exhaust gas, coming from casing 5101, flowing in tubes 5111, the exhaust gas will flow in tubes 5111 in a screwy manner to fully mix with the jetted water to have the dust carried by the exhaust gas contained in the jetted water and to have the noxious gas such as the sulfur dioxIde and the HCL to be solved in the jetted water to become he dilute sulfurous acid and hydrochloric acid respectively. After passing through set of tubes 5110, the exhaust gas enters into disturbing room 5103. Since dust scrubber 511 includes a plurality of Gets of tubes 5110, it is preferable to have the screwy direction of the exhaust gas in tubes 5111 in one set of tubes 5110 different from that in another set of tubes 5110. Thue, after leaving sets of tubes 5110 of dust scrubber 511, the exhaust gas will further mix with the jetted water in disturbing room 5103 to have the jetted water fully contained or solving therein the dust, the refuse 2624 not combusted and the noxious gases originally carried by or mixed in the exhaust gas coming from intake 5102. Here, most of the jetted water falls down to water oulet tube 5105 for being recirculated to be used.The hot gas water scrubbed will carry with it water beads formed in tubes 5111 and disturbing room 5103 and part of refuse 2624 not combusted not contained in jetted water falling down to water outlet tube 5105 to encounter with dust collecter 5130.Dust collecter 5130 includes a plurality of intersuperimposed dust collecting nets 5131, a horizontal water distributing tube 5132 having the lower portion provided a longitudinal groove clamping therein dust collecting nets 5131, a water supplying tube 5133 mounted on the upper portion of water distributing tube 5132 for water supplying water distributing tube 5132 and a filtering net 5134.When the hot gas possibly carrying therein refuse 2624 not combusted encounters with duet collecting nets 5131, refuse 2624 not combusted of small size together with the water beads will be retained on dust collecting nets 5131 where refuse 2624 not combusted will, together with the water flowing on duet collecting nets 5131 coming from supplying tube 5133, fall down to bottom plate 5155 and then, go to outlet tube 5105 and filtering. net 5134 where refuse 2624 not combusted is collected and sent to storage space 3101.After refuse 2624 not combusted and water beade contained therein are retained on dust collecter 5130, the hot gas still contains therein water particles which need be strained. Water strainer 5150 includes a frame not shown secured in casing 5101, straining media secured on the frame and a water passage 5155. The straining media should be fine fiber materials which can block the passing of the water particles but will not absorb the water.After disposed by the above procedures, the exhaust gas has been taken out the dust and refuse 2624 not combusted originally contained therein to become a clean hot gas mixing therewith the steam which has a temperature of not enough high and need be reheated in reheater 4222 as has been described before.SECTION 2 T FILTHY WATER TREATING MEANSSources of the filthy water have two one of which is coming from Sections 1 3 S of Chapter I which is guided by a tube 5221 and has a smaller quantity and the other of which is coming from the water scrubbing means 5100 above described which is guided by a tube 5216 and has a larger quantity. The most effective and economic disposing method of the filthy water is to concentrate it by the steam supplied by steam tube 3207 to obtain a liquid fertilizer by adding therein chemical fertilizers if necessary. A filthy water treating means according to the present invention, as shown in Fig. 18, can include 5 pool 1 a recirculating water pool 5210 2 a filthy water concentrating pool 5220 3 a clean water pool 5230 4 a concentrated filthy water pool 5250 and 5 a condensing pool for the steam coming from filthy water concentrating pool 5220.Recirculating water pool 5210 supplies the water needed by water scrubbing means 5100 and can include a water inlet tube 5211 a valve 5212 , a water outlet tube 5213, a valve 5212, a pump 5214, tube 5116 a tube 5216 and a neutralizing agent adding port 5217 as shown in Fig. 18.Filthy water concentrating pool 5220 can include tube 5221, tube 5213, valve 5212, a tube 5222, a valve 5212 , steam tube 3207, condensed water tube 5223, a steam outlet tube 5224 and a heat dissipating tube 5225 as shown in Fig. 18.Clean water pool 5230 can include a water supplying tube 5231, tube 5224, a cooling tube 5232, a condensed water tube 5233, an auxiliary water supplying tube 5234, hot water tubes 5237, 5211 5238, a pump 5240, a cooling tower 5241 and a cooled water tube 5242 as shown in Fig.18.Concentrated filthy water pool 5250 can include a chemical fertilizer adding pool 5251. Hera, the filthy water should be concentrated as possible as it can be in order to improve its fertility.Condensing pool for the steam coming from filthy water concentratinq pool 5220 can include a chemical agent adding pool 5261. The steam coming from filthy water concentrating pool 522Q has bad smell and thus should be cooled and condensed. Whether the water thus obtained is to be reused or discharged, it should be added with suitable chemicals, if necessary, after analyzed.From the arrows shown in this figure, one should be able to understand the operation and function of the present filthy water treating means.SECTION 3 THE DISPOSAL OF THE ASHAn ash collecting means 53 according to the present invention, as shown in Figs. 19 l9A , can include an oscillating sieve 5310, a sand and rock storing tank 5320 and an ash collecting container 5330. Upon oscillating sieve 5310 receiving thereon the ash unloaded from ash car 41001 it is energized to be oscillating. The ash is sieved by oscillating sieve 5310 and falls down into ash collecting container 5330 where the ash is stirred and mixed with the concentrated filthy water coming from tube 5331 to obtain a fertilizer which can be sold. Those which like the sand and the rock...cannot pass through oscillating sieve 5310 will, through the oscillation of oscillating sieve 5310, fall into sand and rock storing tank 5320 from the bottom of which the sand and the rock contained therein can be loaded in a truck to be disposed.
