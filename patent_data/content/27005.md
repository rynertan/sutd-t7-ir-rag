# A method of electrochemical sensing and a sensor for oxygen, halothane and nitrous oxide.

## Abstract
In a method of electrochemically sensing the presence of O₂, N₂O and halothane in a fluid, a gold or platinum electrode 24 and a silver electrode 26 are exposed to the fluid through a permeable membrane 12 , both electrodes 24, 26 are held at a first potential and the currents due respectively to reduction of oxygen at the gold or platinum electrode 24 and reduction of oxygen and halothane at the silver electrode 26 are sensed, the silver electrode 26 is held at a second potential and the current due to reduction of oxygen and halothane and ni trous oxide is sensed, and from the three currents the presence and or concen tration of any of the three gases is determined.
