# Method for protecting living beings against nefarious electromagnetic fields, and ampoules used thereby.

## Abstract
The wave length and direction of the disturbed electro magnetic field considered as nefarious is ascertained and at right angle to the right vector of said magnetic field at least one ampoule which contains an extract from mistletoe viscum album is arranged.

Ampoule as defined in claim 3, which further contains besides said extract, at least one metalloid.

## Description
Method for protecting living beings against nefarious electromagnetic fields, and ampoules used thereby This invention relates to a method for protecting living beings against nefarious electro magnetic fields. The Applicants have already been able to determine previously that some pathologic phenomenoms which could cause severe disorders, are caused by the ground or soil whereon the living beings remain for a substantial portion of their time. For instance, it has been possible to ascertain that some locations in a house undergo the influence of electromagnetic field changes, notably resulting from water veins, highvoltage cables, refrigerators, television apparatus, water boilers, which perturb the human bio electric weak current functions. The invention has now for object to provide a method which obviates the nefarious influence on living beings of the above defined phenomenoms. For this purpose, one determines the wave length and direction of that electro magnetic field which is considered as nefarious, and one arranges at right angle to the right vector of said magnetic field, at least one ampoule which contains a mistletoe viscum album extract. In a possible variation of said method, a metalloid is added to said extract. The invention further relates to the ampoule for applying the method according to the invention. The method according to the invention is based on the diagnosis that some phenomenoms which are noticeable in living beings, such as tiredness, sleep loss, appetite loss, pre sence of more or less extreme degenerative phenomenoms, are to be explained by the presence inside a living space for example, of altered electro magnetic fields, in such a way that living beings which stay in some locations inside said living space, are subjected to the concentrated nefarious influence of such disturbed electro magnetic fields. Besides living beings in the above defined meaning of the word, it has also been ascertained that buildings themselves or some building materials undergo the nefarious influence of the disturbed magnetic fields. The invention has now for object to provide a method and means whereby said disturbed electro magnetic force fields may be derived. This is obtained according to the invention principle by first ascertaining the wave length and direction of the disturbed electro magnetic field considered as nefarious, and arranging on the right vector from said electro magnetic field, at least one ampoule which is sealed air tight and contains an extract from mistletoe viscum album . In a variation, at least one metalloid may be added to said extract. It has now been possible to ascertain that by arranging such an ampoule in the above defined way, the electromagnetic field may be influenced in such a way that the force lines thereof fall outside that area which is to be protected.With an ampoule having a content about 1 cm3, it has been determined that very marked results could be obtained, as it appeared from repeated measurings. The invention is thus of application when using ampoules which contain pure mistletoe extract, as well as with ampoules which contain such an extract enriched with one or a plurality of metalloids.
