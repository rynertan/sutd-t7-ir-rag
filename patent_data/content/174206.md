# COEXTRUDED RECOVERABLE ARTICLES

## Abstract
A shrinkable tubular article 1 comprises a tubular inner elastomeric member 2 held in a radially expanded configur ation by a tubular outer restraining means 3 . The restrain ing means 3 is prepared from a blend of a relatively rigid thermoplastic material and a segmented copolymer having at least one segment compatible with the thermoplastic and at least one segment compatible with the elastomer of the inner member 2 . Optionally, the restraining means 3 contains a tackifier. The inner surface of the outer member 3 and the outer surface of the inner member 2 are directly bonded together i.e. without an interfacial adhesive . The bond between the members is sufficiently strong to restrain the inner elastomer member 2 from shrinking to, or toward, its unexpanded configuration. In addition, the bond weakens sufficiently on application of solvent to permit the elastomer ic member 2 to peel away from the restraining outer member 3 . Use of a blend of a thermoplastic and a segmented copolymer and optional tackifier, described above, for the restraining member 3 permits the article 1 to be produced in a continuous manner, e.g. by coextrusion.
