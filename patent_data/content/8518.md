# Apparatus for injection moulding plastics material and article made using such apparatus.

## Abstract
In the moulding of plastics material using a female mould cavity 2 into which a number of cores 3a c are inserted, in order to prevent deflection of the cores under the action of the injected plastics material, complementarily shaped forma tions 5, 6 and 7, 8 are provided on the free ends of the cores and the mould wall, the formations being so disposed and arranged as to produce restoring forces tending to reduce deflection of the cores and to prevent transmission of deflec tion between adjacent cores. Various examples of suitable formations are disclosed. The invention is illustrated with reference to its application to the manufacture of battery boxes.
