C4 R C5 S 3 ketohexuronic acid lactone enol form , known as L ascorbic acid C4 R C5 R 3 ketohexuronic acid lactone enol form , known as D isoascorbic acid C4 S CS R 3 ketohexuronic acid lactone enol form , known as D ascorbic acid C4 S C5 S 3 ketohexuronic acid lactone enol form , known as L isoascorbic acid L ascorbic acid vitamin C can also be named as 3 oxo L gulofuranolactone enol form and it is a derivative of L gulofuranose. Likewise,D ascorbic acid is a derivative of D gulofuranose.The isoascorbic acids are derivatives of glucofuranose. Compounds according to the above formula can be named systematically as derivatives of 2 oxo 3, 4 dihydroxy 5 1, 2 dihydroxyethyl 2,5 dihydrofuran ie. L ascorbic acid would be C4 P C5 S 2 oxo 3,4 dihydroxy 5 1,2 dihydroxyethyl 2,5 dihydrofuran. However, the hexuronic acid terminology will be used throughout in referring to compounds according to formula III . Scorbamic and isoscorbamic acids are represented by the formula IV EMI11.1 Compounds according to formula IV are named systematically as 2 oxo 3 amino 4 hydroxy 5 1,2 dihydroxyethyl 2,5 dihydrofuran. However, to be consistent with the generic name for compounds of formula III, these compounds will be named as isomers of 3 keto 2 aminohexuronic acid lactone enol form .

The compounds of formula IV will be referred to as 6 deoxyascorbic acids. An alternate name is 3 keto 6 deoxyhexuronic acid lactone enol form . Dihydroascorbic acid and dihydroisoascorbic acid can be represented by the following formula VI EMI13.1 Systematically, such compounds are named as 2,3 dihydroxy 5 1 hydroxyethyl tetrahydrofurans. As can be seen, there are 4 asymmetric centers in dihydroascorbic acid at C2, C3, C4 and C5.There are thus 2 16 stereoisomers represented by the above formula plus ethers, acetals and ketals thereof active as angiogenesis inhibitors falling within the ambit of this invention. It will be recognized that when R6 is 7 and R7 and R8 are taken together to form EMI14.1 the resulting structure is a ketal when P 9 and R10 are both other than H and an acetal when R9 and R10 is H. For example, if R is methyl and R10 is ethyl, the resulting structure is a ketal of methyl ethylketone formed with the vicinal hydroxyls at C S and C 6.

A dialkyl sulfate R2SO4 can also be used. If one mole each of base and alkylating agent is used, the above reaction produces an ether group at C 3.If it is desired to prepare a diether, with identical ether groups at both C 2 andC 3, two moles of the base and two moles of alkylating agent are used. The resulting compound is a diether of formula VIII EMI17.1 in which R4 and R5 represent the same group. If a diether is desired in which R4 and R5 are different groups, a monoether of formula II EMI17.2 in which R11 is ethyl, for example, and R12 is OH is reacted with an alkylating reagent R4X wherein Ro is other than ethyl, and one mole of base.Depending on the relative reactivities of the C 2 andC 3 hydroxyl groups and of the alkylating agent, a certain amount of reaction takes place at C 2 even if only one mole of alkylating agent is used, and it is desired to produce a C 3 ether only. The mixture of mono and diethers thus formed can be readily separated, as by chromatography. There is also a possibility, where R7 and R8 are hydroxyls, of partially alkylating one of these and forming a diether at C 3 and C 5, for example such diethers can also be separated by chromatography. The above redactions are carried out in an inert mutual solvent, such as DMSO dimethylsulfoxide , DMF N,N dimethylformamide , acetonitrile, nitromethane, diethylsulfoxide. The reactions can be carried out at any convenient temperature in the range O to 800C., but are ordinarily carried out at ambient temperature. The preferred base is sodium methoxide. Under certain circumstances, particularly where there is a competing reaction with the C 5 orC 6 hydroxy, the L ascorbic acid ethers can be prepared in exceptionally Pure form by alkylating is ascorbic acid 5,6 acetonide I where R7 and 28 in formula VII together form a l methylethylidine group and then removing the ketal group bv treatment with acid acetic, 1 HC1 etc. This procedure selectively hydrolyzes the ketal group without affecting the ether groups at C 2 and or C 3. The ketal and acetal starting materials of formula VII are prepared by standard procedures such as a reaction in dioxane or other inert, anhydrous, mutual solvent in the presence of an excess of a Lewis acid e.g., zinc chloride or the like. Scorbamic ethers, ketals, and acetals are prepared in similar fashion to ascorbic and isoascorbic acid ethers, etc., although it should be recognized that ethers can form at only C 3 on the ring since C 2 carries an amine function. Compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R2 are both hydrogen are prepared directly from dihydroascorbic acid, using the procedures exemplified above for ascorbic acid and isoascorbic acid. This invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples. Example 1 3 O n Butyl L ascorbic acid Compound 1 A reaction mixture was prepared containing the following ingredients 33 g. of L ascorbic acid, 10.2 g. of sodium methoxide, 34.5 g. of n butyl iodide and 250 ml. of DMSO. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature and the progress of the reaction monitored by thin layer chromatography.After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was added to 500 ml. of ethyl acetate. 3 O n Butyl L ascorbic acid formed in the above reaction precipitated and was separated by filtration. Further precipitation was caused by adding 300 ml. of toluene to the filtrate.These crystals were also collected and the combined crystals dissolved in 500 ml. of methanol. weight about 20 g. The collected yellow crystals were dissolved in 500 ml. of methanol and 45 g. of silica gel was added to this solution. The solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. A chromatographic column was prepared in the following manner 100 g. of silica 60 were mixed with 500 ml. of hexane. This mixture was placed in a glass chromatographic column containing a glass wool plug covered by a 3 5 mm. layer of sea sand under a nitrogen atmosphere. The silica gel was allowed to comDact for a period of about 20 minutes. Another 2 4 mm. layer of sea sand was added. It was necessary in both instances that the sea sand lavers be leveled.Next the silica precipitate dried mixture was mixed with hexane and this mixture added carefully to the top of the column. Next, about a 5 g. quantity of silica in hexane was added. The column was again placed under nitrogen atmosphere for 15 20 minutes while the two new silica layers were compacting.Finally, a layer of sand 3 6 mm. thick was added. The chromatogram was developed as follows 8 liters of a 1 1 ethyl acetate toluene mixture were passed through the column. No substantial amounts of the desired L ascorbic acid ether were obtained.Next, 4 liters of a 3 1 ethyl acetat toluene eluate were passed through the column, thereby eluting most of the desired ether.

Infrared spectrum M at 1761, 1672 cm 1 As previously stated, the compounds of this invention inhibit the action of angiogenesis factor in promoting the development of blood vessels as part of the grpwth process by tumors, by which mechanism the tumor is able to form an adequate blood supply system. One method of demonstrating such angiogenesis factor inhibitory action in vivo is by the following test procedure. Lysosomal mitochondrial pellets containing angiogenesis factor are prepared from 3683 Morris hepatoma. The pellet is diluted with 7 8 ml. of 15 ficoll. With this dilution, 8 10 serpentine vessels will be produced per standard of dve as injection of the lysosomal mitochondrial pellet. The dilution may be adjusted upward or downward to bring the number of serpentine vessels induced within the 8 10 range so as to provide comparable concentrations of angiogenesis factor per lysosomal mitochondrial preparation. Next, 15SPF ND4 female mice weighing 20 22 g. are shaved on the left side and then divided into three groups of five each. One group is injected subcutaneously and laterally with 0.20 cc. of the lvsosomal mitochondrial preparation diluted with 15 ficoll. This group of mice is then dosed individually by the intraperitoneal route with 0.5 cc. of a solution or suspension in a standard vehicle containing the compound under test, usually at an initial dose level of 300 mg. kg. If this dose level is toxic, two fold dilutions are made until all mice survive a single dose. The second group of mice is injected subcutaneously and laterally with 0.2 cc. of the lysosomal mitochondrial suspension diluted with ficoll and dosed intraperitoneally with 0.5 cc. of the vehicle alone.The mice are sacrificed after 2 hours. Each mouse is placed on its side on a dissecting board with the shaved side up. Starting at the flank, the skin is cut straight to the back of the animal. A similar cut is made behind the front leg.Then the skin is cut along the back making a flap of about one inch by two inches. The skin is carefully separated from the connective tissue using forceps and a scalpel. The skin flap is then laid back exposing the lysosomal mitochondrial implant which is attached to the skin. The skin flap is gently flattened out and with the use of a binocular dissecting scope, serpentine vessels are observed around the lysosomal mitochondrial implant and their number counted. All observations of the number of serpentine vessels are made at the same power of the microscope 1X . The average number of serpentine vessels for each group is calculated. The percent inhibition is then calculated according to the following equation.EMI43.1 tb SEP inhibition SEP SEP 1 x SEP SEP 100 tb where sv average number of serpentine vessels. Tables I, II and III which follow give the results of these tests. Table I covers compounds according to formula I above in which R7 and RE are both H, table II covers compounds in which R7 and we form a l methylethylidene group, and Table III compounds in which R7 plus R8 equal a benzylidine group or other group. One of the compounds of this invention, 3 O n octadecyl 5,6 O l methylethyl idene L ascorbic acid was tested at a series of dose levels for its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and the results of these tests are set forth in Table IV.

Such activity has been found in an artificial metastasis model using Madison lung M 109 carcinoma which metastasizes preferentially to lungs and is not overly sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. The test is carried out as follows. MADISON LUNG METASTASIS ASSAY The Madison M109 lung carcinoma is carried as a transplantable line in syngeneic BFJ B C mice.This tumor line was obtained from the tumor bank atMason Research Institute, Worcester, Mass. For tumor metastasis studies, a subcutaneously grown tumor is aseptically excised, minced into small pieces with a scissors, and gently trypsinized at room temperature to obtain a single cell suspension. The cells are suspended in RPMI 1640 medium M. A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD . Viable M109 cells are determined by trypan blue exclusion, and the cell concentration is determined with a hemocytometer. The cells are adjusted to 1 x 105 viable cells ml. ofg medium.M109 cells are injected i.v. into normal, male BALB C mice. Inoculum volume per mouse is 0.2 ml. 2 x 104 cells . Drugs are administered i.p. to randomized groups of 10 mice 2 days prior to tumor cell inoculation. Controls receive mock injections of 0.5 ml. buffer. Dailvmortalitv is monitored, and median survival times are determined for each group. The results of this test on 3 O n octadecyl is ascorbic acid are recorded in Table 5. Cytoxan was employed as a positive control. In the Table, column 1 gives drug treatment and columns 2 and 3 measure number of lesions standard error per lung on days 30 and 42.

The growth rate and number of lung metastasis in the above experiment were less than usual. A new transplant line was employed in a second determination with lung lesions developing earlier.Table 6 records the results of this experiment here ascorbic acid was employed as the control.

The compounds useful in this invention are relativelv non toxic, having LD50 s above 400 or 1000 mg. kg. in mice. Another laboratory test involving angiogenesis or neovascularization is based on the time period required for a differentiated tumor to become undifferentiated vascularized . An inflammatory response enhances tumor growth and reduces the lag phase. In this test, rats are injected with a test drug 30 minutes prior to dosing with ICFA incomplete Freund s adjuvant plus India ink intradermally in a shaved area on a rat s back, thus providing a marked injection site. After 3 days of twice daily administration of the test drug followed 30 minutes later bv administration of ICFA, the tumor is transplanted on the periphery of the marked injection site. The animals are weighed and the tumor size determined length width 2 at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Morris hepatoma 5123D was used as the undifferentiated tumor. Following the above experimental procedure, 10 100 mg. of 3 O n octadecyl L ascorbic acid administered once or twice a day orally either inhibited the growth of the undifferentiated tumor or delayed its induction from 4 7 days. 0.5 cc. of ICFA were also given once or twice daily subcutaneously to each test rat. A third laboratory test has been employed to demonstrate the activity of compounds according to I above as inhibitors of angiogenesis. This test method is a collagen arthritis assay carried out as follows. Type II collagen is isolated from bovine articular cartilage by the method of Strawich andNimni IBiochemistry, 10, 3905, 1971 1. The collagen is dissolved in 0.1 M acetic acid and stored at 200. Type II collagen solution is diluted to 2 mg. ml.concentration and emulsified thoroughly with an equal volume of incomplete Freund s adjuvant ICFA . The emulsion containing approximately 0.5 mg. of collagen is injected intradermally to groups of 6 inbred isewis male rats Charles River Breeders 170 200 g. at various sites in the dorsal area. The hindpaw volumes of each rat is measured and recorded three times a week throughout the test period to assess the inflammatory reaction. The animals receive compounds under test as suspensions in carboxymethylcellulose vehicle, by oral gavage, 5 days per week Mon. Fri. .At the end of the test day 28 or 30 , the blood of these animals is drawn by cardiac puncture and the serum anti type II collagen antibody levels are estimated by passive hemagglutination technique, using glutaraldehyde treated sheep red cells, to which typeII collagen is conjugated Avrameas et al.,Immunochemistry, 6, 67, 1969 Andriopoulos et al.,Arth. Rheum., 19, 613, 1976 . The cellular response or delayed type hypersensitivity response to type II collagen is measured by the radiometric ear index assay Kostiala, Immunology, 33, 561, 1977 . In certain experiments, the bone damage occurring because of immunization with type II collagen and the effects of drugs are determined from the radiographs of the hindpaws of two or three representative animals from each group.Injections of ICFAs alone were employed to some rats as a negative control. In one experiment carried out according to the above protocol, 3 O n octadecyl 5,6 O l methyl ethylidine is ascorbic acid and 3 O n octadecyl isascorbic acid were the test drugs and were administered orally at a 50 mg. kg. dose. The former compound inhibited the swelling of the paw caused by injection of Type II collagen by about 50 and with the latter, paw volumes were not substantially different from those of the ICFA treated rats negative controls . In other runs, with 3 0 n octadecyl is ascorbic acid, at the 50 mg. kg. dose level, paw volumes were 90 100 lower than those of rats immunized with type II collagen but not treated with drugs positive controls .With 3 O n octadecyl 5,6 O 1 methylethylidene L ascorbic acid at the same dose level, the paw volumes were indistinguishable from negative control levels. At lower dosages with 3 O n octadecylL ascorbic acid, a 12.5 mg. kg. dose decreased paw volumes by about 25 , but at a 17.5 mg. kg. dose, the paw volumes were indistinguishable from controls. 2,3 O bisfn octadecyl L ascorbic acid at 12.5 and 25 mg.lkg. dose levels also gave decreased paw volumes 33 67 . With 3 O m trifluoromethyl benzyl is ascorbic acid at a 25 mg. kg. dose, paw volumes were substantiallv the same as ICFA controls. The following additional drugs gave substantial decreases in paw swelling caused by collagenType II injections at a drug dose of 15 mg. kg. per os 3 O n heptadecyl L ascorbic acid, 2,3 0 bis 4 cyano benzyl 5,6 1 methylethylidene L ascorbic acid, 3 0 4 cyanobutyl 5,6 1 methylethylidene L ascorbic acid, and 5,6 O l n decylethylidene L ascorbic acid. In utilizing the compounds of this invention as angiogenesis inhibiting agents, either the parenteral or oral route of administration may be employed.For oral dosage, which is preferred, a suitable quantity of a drug according to formula I is mixed with one or more conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as starch and the mixture placed in telescoping gelatin capsules, each capsule containing a divided or undivided dose. Alternatively, a mixture of the drug plus starch plus a lubricant plus other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as required is compressed into tablets each containing from 100 to 500 mg. of active ingredient.The tablets may be scored if lower or divided dosages are to be used. For parenteral administration, the drug is administered in solution or suspension. Each unit dose of the drug for either route of administration will contain an amount of a drug according to I above effective to inhibit angiogenesis. Daily dose levels in mammals would be in the range 10 100 mg. kg. of mammalian body weight.
