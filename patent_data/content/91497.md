## Description
Production of frozen fis The present invention relates to the production of coated frozen fish products for subsequent oven preparation.Coated frozen fish products, suitahle for preparation by oven cooking and which when cooked have a crisp, browned outer surface, require a product quality especially designed for such preparaticn. Such coated fish portions and iillets are normally pretreated by deep fat frying at about 200or before freezing, the main reason being to obtain a fat coating which makes oven heating possible. If the fish were not pretreated by deep fat frying an inconveniently long oven cooking time would be necessary and the final cooked product would have a coating which is mushy with an objectionable taste. However pretreatment by deep fat frying is not only expensive but during the frying there Is a substantial loss of moisture which reduces the yield.We have developed a process for preparing coated frozen fish products suitable for oven cooking which is cheaper, easier to control and gives a higher yield than a process which involves a pretreatment by deep fat frying at a high temperature. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a coated frozen fish product wherein a fre zen fish piece is initially battered, then breaded a first time, thereafter coated with an edible fat in liquid form having a melting point of less than 500C, and finally breaded a second time before beina frozen.The frozen fish piece may be a sawed portion or a single frozen fillet and before being initially battered it may be preduste to cover the naked surfacc with water absorbing ingredients such as starches, egg white powder or potato powder to give a better contact between the fish and the coating.The fish piece may be battered by using standard battering equipment. The amount of batter applied to the fish piece may conveniently be from 5 to 9 by weight and preferably from 6 to 8 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product. Preferably a pumpable flour based batter is used comprising, for example, wheat flour, wheat starch, water and a small amount of skimmed milk or egg white powder.Any excess batter may be blown off by air streams.After being battered the fish is subjected to a first breading treatment conveniently using standard breading equipment. The amount of breading material applied to the fish piece by the first breading treatment is conveniently from 5 t to 9 by weight and preferably from 6 to 8 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product. Conveniently the breading material consists of breadcrumbs, desirably of a dark colour, having a particle size of from 0.1 to 2.0 mm and preferably from 0.25 to 1.0 mm. Any excess breading material may be blown off by air streams.The edible fat may be a bland edible vegetable oil or a blend of vegetable oil with an animal or vegetable fat and is conveniently a margarine which may be liquid or solid at ambient temperature. The amount of edible fat applied to the fish piece may suitably be from 7 to 15 , preferably from 8 e to 14 and especially from 9 to 12 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product. The fish piece is preferably coated with the liquid fat by dipping the fish piece into the licuid fat.If the fat is liquid at ambient temperature, although the coating operation may be carried out with the fat at an elevated temperature, for example up to 400, it is more conveniently carried out with the fat at ambient temperature, preferably from 20 C to 250C. If the fat is solid at ambient temperature it must be melted and the coating operation is conveniently carried out with the melted fat at a temperature of from 550C to 750C and preferably from 60 C to 70 C. Any excess fat may be blown off by air streams.The coating operation may suitably be carried out using standard battering equipment. The liquid fat is advantageous ly circulated by means of a pump from a storage vessel to a position where it is poured onto the fish pieces the excess being caught in a trough from which the liquid fat returns to the storage vessel. When the fish piece is coated by dipping into the liquid fat it is conveniently dipped in the fat in the trough for example by transporting it through the fat in the trough on a conveyor belt. Any breading material in the circulating oil may be filtered by a simple metal screen immediately before the pump infeed. Since the circulating liquid fat is cooled by the frozen fish pieces it is necessary to heat the fat, preferably with a thermostatically controlled heating unit to ensure a substantially stable fat temperature.When using a fat which is liquid at ambient temperature this may conveniently be done either by an electric heating coil in the vessel containing the fat or by a steam kettle beside the vessel which is included in the liquid fat dirculation by connections to the pump. When using a fat which is solid at ambient temperature both the melting of the fat and the heating to maintain a stable temperature is preferably performed by a separate fat melting unit.The fish piece is then breaded for a second time conveniently using standard breading equipment to apply a thin layer of breading material onto the fat layer. The amount of breadina material applied to the fish piece in the second breading treatment is conveiently from 2.5 to 7.5 by weight and preferably from 4 to 6 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product. Conveniently, the breading material, as in the first breading treatment, consists of breadcrumbs, desirably of a dark colour, having a particle size of from 0.1 to 2.0 mm and preferably from 0.25 to 1.0 mm. The second layer is applied to the fat layer in order to reduce stickiness during handling and to improve the appearance. Any excess breading material may be blown off by air streams.The fish pieces are conveniently transported to the succes sive stages of the process on conveyor belts.The amounts of the different coatings may be controlled by either the belt speed, the viscosity of the batter, the temperature of the oil or by an air stream for blowing off excess material after each step in the operation. However, for practical purposes the amounts of the different cotis are controlled by the viscosity of the batter or the use of air streams for blowing off excess material. The coated fish products may afterwards be frozen and packa ged. In their preparation for eating, the products are heated in a convection oven usually at a temperature of from 175 C to 2000C for about 30 minutes to obtain an internal temperature above 600C.The process of the present invention is especially valuable for preparinS coated frozen fish products to be used in the catering industry.The following Examples further illustrate the present inven tion.Example 1A fish fillet is .ransported on a conveyor belt to a stan battering unit where it is coated with a batter consisting of 22 wheat flour, 4.5 salt, 1 skim milk powder, 21.5 wheat starch, 1 spices and 50 water. Excess coating is blown off by an air stream so that the amount of coating is 8 9 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product. The fish fillet is then transported to a standard breading unit where it is coated with dark coloured breadcrumbs having a particle size in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 mm diameter. Excess breadcrumbs are blown off by an air stream so that the amount of breadcrumbs applied is 8 by weight based on the weight of the final fish product.The fish is next transported to another standard battering unit containing Melba Frite 100 liquid margarine sold by Margarinbolaget, Sweden which circulates through the unit and is maintained at 250C by an electric heating coil in the it. The fish fillet passes through the liquid margarine and afterwards any excess is blown off by an air stream so that the amount of margarine coated on the fish is 9 by weight based on the weight of the final product. Finally the fish is transported to another breading unit where it is coated a second time with dark coloured breadcrumbs having a particle size in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 mm diameter.After being coated, excess breadcrumbs are blown off by air streams above and below the fish product so that the amount of breadcrumbs applied by the second coating is 5 z by weight based on the weight of the final product. Any excess oil may also be blown off dry these airstreams. The coated fish product is afterwards frozen and packaged.Example 2A similar procedure to that described in Example 1 was followed but in which the liquid margarine was heated to 400C and maintained at this temperature instead of 250C giving an uptake of 7 p by weight of margarine based on the weight of final fish product. Example 3A similar procedure to that described in Example 1 was followed but using Norma 100, solid fat margarine sold byMargarinbolaget, Sweden which was melted in a separate melting unit which also heated the circulating margarine to a constant temperature of 450C. The uptake of the margarine was 9.3 by weight based on the weight of the final product.Example 4A similar procedure to that described in Example 3 was followed but in wnich the melted margarine was heated to 70 C and rintaIne at this temperature instead of 45 C, giving an uptake of 6.7 by weight of margarine based on the weight of the final fish product.
