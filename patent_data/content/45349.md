# Superconductive latch circuit.

## Abstract
Superconductive latch circuit employing superconduc tive switching devices D1, D2 which can be powered by the same phase of AC power used to power other circuits with which the latch is used. The latch reliably holds data when the AC power diminishes to zero, and also when the AC power changes polarity. The latch is comprised of a storage loop including a superconductive switch D2 and an inductor L . It also includes another superconductive swtch D1 through which an AC gate current can flow and whose state determines whether or not the AC current is delivered to the supercon ductive storage loop. Information is stored in the loop as the presence and absence of a circulating current of either polarity.
