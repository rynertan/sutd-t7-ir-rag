# Optical heads.

## Abstract
An optical head 21 includes a plate like half mirror 22 for reflecting a beam 6 from a light source 5 , via a collimator lens 7 and an objective lens 8 , onto an optical recording medium 11 . The beam is reflected from the medium 11 , via the lenses 7, 8 onto the half mirror 22 . The half mirror 22 serves as a beam splitter, enabling the beam to pass there through to reach a photodetector 12 , and functions also to produce astigmatism for detecting a focusing error. An optical element 23 is disposed between the half mirror 22 and the photodetector 12 for correcting a coma produced by passage of the beam through the half mirror.
