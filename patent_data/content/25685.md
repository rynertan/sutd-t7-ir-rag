# TRAINING CIRCUIT FOR AUDIO SIGNAL RECOGNITION COMPUTER

## Abstract
A signal pattern recognition system includes a reference pattern memory 26, 114 storing plural reference data pat terns against which input patterns are compared for recogni tion. The reference data patterns are formed by merging 130 training patterns together. Each training pattern, to be accept ed for merging, must match the previously merged patterns by a threshold amount 122 . The threshold is automatically varied 136 as the number of previously merged training patterns in creases. if a predetermined number 124 of successive train ing patterns is below the threshold, the training process is repeated, from the beginning, for the reference pattern which generates the errors. The system automatically trains each re ference pattern with the same number 124 of training pat terns to assure uniformity when input data patterns are com pared for recognition.
