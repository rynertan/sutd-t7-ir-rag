## Description
Bleaching Compositions THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to bleaching and cleaning compositions containing hypochlorite and in particular to thickened bleach compositions, that is compositions having an increased viscosity as compared with straight aqueous solutions of alkali metal hypochlorite. Thickened bleach compositions have a number of advantages over unthickened bleach compositions in that the more viscous compositions adhere more readily and for a longer time to vertical and inclined surfaces than do the unthickened compositions. The performance of thickened bleach compositions is therefore superior to that of unthickened bleach compositions for vertical and inclined surfaces such as are found in lavatory pans, urinals, drains, waste pipes and the like. In recent years a number of proposals have been made which provide thickened bleach compositions, for example compositions having viscosities at 250C of greater than 10 centistokes, by the addition of suitable thickening agents. British Patent Specification No. 1,329,086 describes thickened aqueous alkali metal hypochlorite compositions which contain in addition to the hypochlorite, an alkali metal salt of aC8 to C18 fully saturated fatty acid and a hypochlorite soluble surface active agent, the latter being exemplified by an amine oxide containing a C8 to C18 alkyl group. The amine oxides described in the specification are those commercially available which are derived from naturally occuring C8 to C18 fatty acids, for example coconut acids, lauric acid and myristic acid. British Patent Specification No. 1,466,560 describes thickened aqueous alkali metal hypochlorite compositions in which the thickening is achieved by mixing hypochlorite solutions with combinations of certain sarcosinate or tauride surfactants with one or more other surfactants which may comprise certain soaps, quaternary ammonium compounds, amine oxides, betaines and or alkanolamides. British Patent Specification No. 1,584,379 describes thickened bleach compositions comprising an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hypochlorite containing a a sucrose surfactant consisting of one or more esters of a long chain fatty acid with sucrose and b another hypochlorite soluble surfactant, for example a quaternary ammonium compound, an amine oxide, a betaine or an alkanolamide. British Patent Specification No. 2,051,162A describes thickened aqueous alkali metal hypochlorite compositions which contain, in addition to the hypochlorite an amine oxide and an alkali metal alkyl sulphate, British Patent Specification No. 2,003,522A describes thickened aqueous alkali metal hypochlorite compositions which contain a C8 to C20 branched chain amine oxide or a mixture of such amine oxides or a mixture of such a branched chain amine oxide with a straight chain amine oxide. Although thickened bleaches containing a single compound as the thickening agent have been describes see for example BritishPatent Specification No. 2,003,522A hereinbefore mentioned it has been found to be economically advantageous to employ at least two, generally organic, compounds as thickening agents for the aqueous hypochlorite solution. A typical and well known example is that described in U.K. Specification No. 1,329,086 in which thickening is achieved by a combination of a soap and an amine oxide in specified proportions. We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to prepare thickened bleach compositions using essentially a single compound of a particular type as the thickening agent, the overall cost of such compositions being comparable to that of compositions containing two compounds as thickening agents. Accordingly the present invention provides a thickened bleach composition comprising water, an alkali metal hypochlorite, and an organic thickening agent which consists solely of a straight chain amine oxide or a mixture of straight chain amine oxides wherein the or at least one amine oxide has at least 14 carbon atoms in the straight chain. Ideally, the organic thickening agent should consist of a substantially pure C14 or, preferably, C15 straight chain amine oxide alone. Compositions according to this invention contain no significant amounts of organic thickening agent other than straight chain amine oxide. Straight chain amine oxides containing more than 15 carbon atoms in the straight chain have limited solubility in alkali metal hypochlorite solutions. However, they can be incorporated in thickened bleach compositions provided that suitable solubilising agents are employed. We have found that straight chain amine oxides containing less than 16 carbon atoms in the straight chain can be used for this purpose. Optionally, thickened bleaches according to this invention can contain additional components frequently incorporated in such compositions including caustic alkali, alkali metal salts, perfume and colourants. Rence compositions according to this invention may include caustic alkali, for example sodium hydroxide, and or an alkali metal salt, for example sodium chloride, each being present preferably in an amount of 0.5 to 5Z be weight. A perfume and or a colourant may also be present in the composition. The bleach compositions of this invention preferably contain an amount of available chlorine in the range 1 to 15 , preferably 5 to 10X by weight. The compositions of this invention preferably have a viscosity of at least 10 centistokes at 250 C, measured with an Ostwald viscometer and a cloud point in excess of 350C. The following examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight and all viscosities are measured at 259C with an Ostwald viscometer, further illustrate thickened bleach compositions according to this invention.EXAMPLES 1 TO 14 A number of thickened bleach compositions were prepared by mixing sodium hypochlorite, to give an available chlorine level of 8 , sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and a single C12 to C18 straight chain amine oxide in cold water. A similar composition, identified as composition A, containing no amine oxide was also prepared for comparative purposes. Details of the compositions, their viscosities and cloud points are shown in Table 1. The results show that the thickening behaviour of straight chain amine oxides increases with increasing chain length. The solubility of straight chain amine oxides in sodium hydrochlorite solutions decreases with increasing chain length.Examples 15 to 26 A number of thickened bleach compositions were prepared by mixing sodium hypochlorite, to give an available Chlorine level of 8 , sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and mixtures of C12, C14 and C16 straight chain amine oxides in cold water. Details of the compositions and their properties are shown in Table 2 and the results illustrate the solubilising effect of lower straight chain amine oxides on formulations containing C16 straight chain amine oxides. The examples show that technically and economically acceptable thickened bleaches can be prepared using a single organic thickeneing agent the agent comprising a single straight chain amine or a mixture of straight chain amine oxides with no other organic thickener present in contrast to those at present on the market which generally contain at least two organic thickening agents. At the same time the examples illustrate that acceptable thickening can be achieved using amine oxide in which the alkyl group is wholly a straight chain group.
