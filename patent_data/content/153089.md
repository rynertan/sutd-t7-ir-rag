# Ultra violet absorbing compounds and compositions containing said compounds.

## Abstract
2 Ethylhexyl and 2 octyl p dimethylaminocinnamates un expectedly are liquid at room temperature and miscible with liq uid paraffin i.e. mineral oil unlike related alkyl p dimethyl aminocinnamates such as 1 octyl p dimethylaminocinnamate. They absorb light in the melanogenic range 320 to 420 nm and are dermatoligically acceptable and hence useful as UVA ab sorbers in sunscreen and cosmetic compositions.
