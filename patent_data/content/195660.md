# High solids coating compositions.

## Abstract
A high solids coating composition has 10 to 96 per cent by weight of resin solids and is composed of 10 to 96 weight per cent of a low molecular weight epoxy oligomer equivalent weight 1100 or less , 2 to 35 weight per cent of a crosslinking glycoluril formaldehyde resin, 0.05 to 0.5 weight per cent of a primary sulfonic acid catalyst and 2 to 40 weight per cent of a solvent which is organic or contains water. The oligomer is condensed upon heating into a high molecular weight polymer film with simultaneous crosslinking with the crosslinking agent.
