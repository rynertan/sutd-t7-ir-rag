# Process for the preparation of granules.

## Abstract
Preparation of granules by making solid nuclei grow in a fluidized bed, by causing a liquid material to solidify there on, and removing the granules thus obtained, the liquid material being introduced into the bed from the bottom upwards with the aid of a feeding device provided with a central channel through which the liquid material is supplied and a channel concentric therewith through which a power ful gas stream is supplied, which creates a rarefied zone in the bed above the feeding device, wherein the liquid material is made to exit from the central channel into the rarefied zone as a virtually closed, conical film, nuclei from the bed are carried through the film with the aid of the powerful gas stream and next, during transport of the so moistened nuclei through the rarefied zone, the liquid material taken up by the nuclei is allowed to solidify. By this process only a small amount of high energetic gas is required, while very little agglomeration and dust formation occurs.
