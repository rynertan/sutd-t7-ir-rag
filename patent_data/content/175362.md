# CAPACITIVE TYPE DETECTION DEVICE

## Abstract
A detection device comprising a detection wall member for sensing a predetermined existence of an object adjacent to the device, detection electrode member including a de tection electrode and a ground electrode which are dispos ed in the detection wall member, oscillation circuit member including a resonance circuit associated with a capacitance between the detection and ground electrodes, and detection circuit member for detecting change of oscillation of the os cillation circuit member by change of the capacitance be tween the electrodes so that the predetermined existence of the object adjacent to the detection wall member is detected by the device.
