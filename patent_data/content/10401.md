## Description
NOVEL l ARYLCYCLOALKYLMETHYL ISOTHIOCYANATES A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM, AND COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEMBackground of the invention In Brit. Pat. No. 892,790 and in U.S. Pat No.3,367,957 there are described respectively the compounds methyl isothiocyanate and cyclopropylmethyl isothiocyanate both as nematocides. The present invention relates to a novel class of biocidal l arylcycloalkylmethyl isothiocyanates which differ from the aforementioned cyclopropylmethyl isothiocyanate by the presence of an aryl radical in the l position of the cycloalkane ring.Description of the preferred embodiments This invention is concerned with novel l arylcycloalkylmethyl isothiocyanates which may structurally be represented by the formula I EMI1.1 wherein Ar s a a mews per selected from the group consisting of t ie n1 nalothienyl, naphthalenyl, pyridinyl, phenyl and substituter phenyl, said substituted phenyl having from 1 to 3 substituents, each independently selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkyloxy, lower alkylthio, halo, amino, nitro, cyano and trifluoromethyl and n is an integer of from 2 to 5 inclusive. In the foregoing and in the following definitions, the term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo the term lower alkyl is meant to include straight and branched hydrocarbon radicals, having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, l methylethyl, 1,1 dimethylethyl and the like. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by the application of methodologies known in the art, as described, for example, in Saul Patai Ed. The chemistry of cyanates and their thioderivatives John Wiley Sons ChichesterNew York Brisbane Toronto 1977 p. 1013 1053. One meted of preparing the compounds I is by the reaction of the amine II with carbon disulfide III to obtain a dithiD carbamate of formula IV and subsequently converting the latter into the desired isothiocyanate I by the reaction of IV with an appropriate decomposing anent, e.g. a lower alkyl chloroformate V , preferably ethyl chloroformate. The foregoing reactions are illustrated as follows EMI2.1 EMI3.1 Said reaction of the amine II with carbon disulfide III is conveniently carried out in an appropriate reaction inert solvent such as, for example, water a lower alcohols e.g. methanol an alifatic , alicyclic or aromatic hydru carbon, e.g. hexane, cyclohexane or benzene a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. trichloromethane an alifatic or alicyclic ether, e.g. L,l oxybispropane or 1,4 dioxane and the likeThe reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an appropriate base such as, for example, an alkaline or an earth alkaline metal hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide a tertiary amine, e.g. N,N diethylethanamine and the like.Preferably the reaction temperature is kept below room temperature and, most preferably between 0 C and 10 C. The decomposition reaction of the dithiocarbamate IV by its reaction with the lower alkyl chloroformate V is suitably conducted in an appropriate reaction inert solvent e.g. one of the solvents described hereabove for the reaction of II with III . Bases such as alkaline metal or earth alkaline metal hydroxide, e.g. potassium hydroxide, or tertiary amines, e.g. N,N diethylethanamine are taught to have a catalytic effect on the decomposition of the intermediately formed carbalkoxydithiocarbamate VI . See, e.g. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 83, 2532 2536 1961 . Somewhat elevated temperatures may be used to enhance the reactionrate. EMI4.1 The amines of formula II , used as starting materials herein, are generally known and they may all be prepared following methods described in the literature for the preparation of such known or similar compounds. The isothiocyanates of formula I possess valuable biocidal properties and as such they can be used in a wide variety of circumstances. More particularly, the subject compounds have fungicidal, bactericidal and insecticidal properties, d as a result they can be used to combat any unwanted growth of fungi or bacteria or to kill insects. The compounds of formula I are especially used, as preservatives of organic materials which are susceptible to attack by noxious microorganisms and insects. Te can be used, for example, for the preservation of technical agricultural products, such as, for example, wood, fibers, textiles, jute, cork, paper, dyes, etc., and as disinfectan in veterinary medium and human hygiene. The subject compounds are also active against marine organisms and as such they can be used as antifouling agents. The useful biocidal properties of the compounds . formula I are clearly illustrated in the following experiments. A. Insecticidal activity against the house fly Musca domestica Test solutions are prepared by dissolving the testcompounds in 2 propanone at a concentration of 2.5 and further diluting the thus obtained stock solution with water to obtain final concentrations of the active ingredient of respectively 0.02, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0025. 1 ml of the test solution is poured onto a filter paper of 11 cm diameter.

The active agents can be used in suitable solvents or diluents in the form of emulsions, suspensions, dispersions or ointments, on suitable solid or semi solid carrier substances, in ordinary or synthetic soaps, detergents or dispersion media. Solid carrier substances which are suitable for the preparation of compositions in powder form include various inert, porous and pulverous distributing agents of inorganic or organic nature such as, for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, in the form of prepared chalk or ground limestone, kaolin, bole, bentonite, talcum, silic acid or boric acid powdered cork, sawdust, and other fine pulverous materials of vegetable origin are also carrier substances. The isothiocyanates are mixed with these carrier substances, for example by being ground therewith alternatively, the inert carrier substance is impregnated with a solution of the active component in a readily volatile.solvent and the solvent is thereafter eliminated by heating or by filtering with suction at reduced pressure. By adding wetting and or dispersing agents, pulverous preparations can also be made readily wettable with water, so that suspensions are obtained. Inert solvents used for the production of liquid preparations should preferably not be readily inflammable and as far as possible non toxic to warm blooded animals or plants in the relevant surroundings. Solvents suitable for this purpose are high boiling oils, for example, of vegetable origin, and lower boiling solvents, such as, for example, isopropanol, dimethylsulfoxide, hydrogenated naphthalenes and alkylated naphthalenes. It is of course, also possible to use mixtures of solvents. Solutions can be prepared in the usual way, if necessary, with assistance of solution promoters. Other liquid forms which can be used consist of emulsions or suspensions of the active compound in water or suitable inert solvents, or also concentrates for preparing such emulsions, which can be directly adjusted to the required concentrations.For this purpose, the isothiocyanates are, for example, mixed with a dispersing or emulsifying agent. The active component can also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable inert solvent and mixed simultaneously or subsequently with a dispersing or emulsifying agent. It is also possible to use semi solid carrier substances of a cream ointment, paste or waxlike nature, into which the isothiocyanates can be incorporated, if necessary, with the aid of solution promoters and or emulsifiers.Vaseline and other cream bases are examples of semi solid carrier substances. Furthermore, it is possible for the isothiocyanates to be used in the form of aerosols. For this purpose, the active component is dissolved or dispersed, if necessary, with the aid of suitable inert solvents as carrier liquids, such as difluorodichloromethane, which at atmospheric pressure boils at a temperature lower than room temperature, or in other volatile solvents. In this way, solutions under pressure are obtained which, when sprayed, yield aerosols which are particularly suitable for controlling or combating fungi and bacteria, e.g. in closed chambers and storage rooms, and for application to vegetation for eradicating or for preventing infection by fungi or bacteria. The isothiocyanates and the compositions thereof can be applied by conventional methods. For example a growth of microorganisms or a material to be treated or to be protected against attack by microorganisms can be treated with the isothiocyanates and the compositions thereof by dusting, sprinkling, spraying, brushing, dipping, smearing, impregnating or other suitable means. When the isothiocyanates are employed in combination with suitable carriers, e.g. in solution, suspension, dust, powder, ointment, emulsion rd the like forms, a high activity over a very high range of dilution is observed.For example, concentrations of the active ingredient ranging from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight, based on the weight of composition employed, have been found effective in combating microorganisms.Higher concentrations may naturally also be employed as warranted by the particular situation. The compounds of formula I may be applied alone or optionally together with other biocidal substances, e.g., bactericides, fungicides, insecticides etc. When used in the preservation of organic material, particularly wood, it has been found advantageous to combine the isothiocyanates of formula I with antimicrobial imidazole and triazole derivatives such as for example, l 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 2 propenyloxy ethyl lH imidazole, 1 2 2,4 dichloro phenyl 1,3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl 1H 1,2,4 triazhole, 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 4 ethyl 1,3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl 1H 1, 2,4 triazole, 1 4 chlorophenoxy 1 1H 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 3,3 dimethylbutan 2 one and the like.
