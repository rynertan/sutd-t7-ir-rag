# RADIO WAVE SEALING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A radio wave sealing device has a choke unit provided in a leakage wave transmission path of equipment generating high frequency electromagnetic waves. The choke unit has a gutter wall 29 corresponding to a ground conductor, a large number of strip conductors 30 positioned with a width of a at a pitch P, and a gutter base 31 , to reduce the propagation of radio waves in the longitudinal direction of the gutter. In addition, since the characteristic impedance of part of the choke varies in a zone shorter than λ 4 of the frequency being used, the depth and width of the gutter can be reduced to less than λ 4.
