## Description
The present invention relates to an optical sheet material capable of screening ultraviolet rays and correcting such defects of vision as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia. The incidence of ultraviolet rays on the eyes is generally prevented by the use of sunglasses made by provided parallel surface glasses or plastics pieces with suitable light screening properties and or absorbing properties, with respect to specific wavelengths, by adding a light screening or absorbing substance during their raw material manufacturing stage, or colouring the transparent glasses or applying a coating to the surface of the glasses. In the case of a wearer having nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism or presbyopia, glass or plastics lenses are employed to form spectacles, sometimes in combination with the above screening or absorbing properties. It is also quite common for ordinary spectacles to be used on top of or beneath sunglasses. However, such sunglasses tend to be expensive and also, since they are not used continuously, if they are not to be damaged they require the provision of a case for carrying or accommodating the glasses. Also, in everyday life, particularly to obtain protection from intense sunshine in the summer, or the sunshine on a snowy day or the reflected light of such sunshine, it is often necessary to use a more powerful ultraviolet screening substitute in place of the sunglasses, and the same applies to any person having nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism or presbyopia. US 3967885 discloses an opaque mask attached to spectacle frames, the mask having a series of transparent areas. The arrangement is for post operative cataract patients and provides protection against excessive light while improving the focusing ability of the eye. EP A 141736 which constitutes a state of the art under Art.S4 3 EPC discloses a universal vision correction device in which a thin generally reflective sheet is placed over spectacle lenses. The sheet has small transparent zones. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide an observation optical sheet material which is so designed that, where an extremely bright situation is suddenly experienced, and sunglasses and or correction glasses are not to hand, it is nevertheless possible to observe such bright situation whilst protecting one s eyes by the use of a material according to the invention incorporated in one of those things kept at one s side or usually carried on the person, e.g. an item of stationery such as an underlaying sheet or ruler, or other commonplace item such as a book cover, a bookmarker, a corner of a book cover, a cash card, credit card or member s card, a watch band, a shoulder belt for bags or a tag. In accordance with the invention there is provided an optical sheet material which is capable of permitting sufficient light transmission therethrough to support human vision, at least a part of the sheet being generally opaque but with a large number of spot like transparent portions distributed uniformly thereover, characterised in that each spot like transparent portion is formed of substantially hexagonal shape inscribed in or circumscribing a circle having a diameter between 0.7 and 2.0 mm, the sides of the hexagonal shape being curved arcuately inwards, the transparent portions being arranged in a staggered manner such that lines connecting their central points form regular triangles. The transparent portions are distributed uniformly in a staggered manner, for example, so that the centres are spaced apart by between 2.0 to 5.5 mm. Suitable materials for the above constructed optical material of this invention must be substances having a suitable strength, physical properties, elegance and durability required for use as the materials for the previously mentioned articles as well as a capacity for maintaining the transparency of the transparent portions for a comparatively long period of time, and these substances include for example plastics such as soft or hard polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylic, methacrylic acid, polyurethane, polyolefin and polyester plastics. It is to be noted that the transparent portions may take the form of holes made through the material and the material may be an opaque material such as a metal sheet. The invention is not restricted to the above mentioned plastics. On the other hand, the spot like transparent portions and the opaque portion may be formed separately from each other may e.g. by a method in which an opaque portion is printed by photogravure on the surface of a transparent sheet of such plastics material so as to leave spot like blank portions, and then a transparent film is applied onto the printed surface, or it may be a method of printing on opaque layer over the whole surface of a transparent film, and forming transparent portions or holes by such means as etching or punching. Also, any of various other methods may be used. The thus constructed observation optical sheet material of this invention can be used daily in conformity with the purpose for which the article is primarily intended, so that when a need suddenly occurs to study an object or scene in a place where ultraviolet rays are abundent, whether indoors or outdoors, the optical material is held in front of the eyes and the object or scene is studied through it. In such a case, the amount of the incident light on the eyes through the spot like transparent portions is restricted considerably by the opaque portions. As a result, movements take place subconsciously in the eyes to distinguish the object or scene in that the ciliary body or the structure for adjusting the curvature of the crystalline lens in front of the eyeball of each eye functions naturally in such a manner that the curvature of the lens is decreased if the person is nearsighted and the curvature is increased if the person is farsighted. Thus, not only a person of normal vision but also a person having nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism or presbyopia can comparatively accurately look at an object through the optical material according to the invention. This principle is similar to that of a pinhole camera which takes a picture through a minute aperture,so that even if there are variations in the relative distance of an object corresponding to the object to be photographed in the case of a camera, the focal point is not varied much, owing to the long depth of focus, and therefore the object can be seen clearly through the optical material. According to another aspect of the present invention, a dual function assembly comprises a readily portable and or accessible object having a primary function, and also having, as a part of it, or associated with it, a piece of sheet material at least a portion of which has the secondary function of forming an optical device which is capable of permitting sufficient light transmission therethrough to support human vision, at least a part of the sheet being generally opaque but with a large number of spot like transparent portions distributed uniformly thereover, wherein each spot like transparent portion is formed of substantially hexagonal shape inscribing or circumscribing a circle having a diameter between 0.7 and 2.0 mm, the sides of the hexagonal shape being curved arcuately inwards, the transparent portions being arranged in a staggered manner such that lines connecting their central points form regular triangles. The above and other objects as well as advantageous features of the invention will become more clear from the following description of certain specific embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which Referring to Figures 1 and 2A, numeral 1 designates an optical material according to the invention, and 2 a plurality of spot like transparent portions each formed into a hexagonal shape such as one whose sides circumscribe a circle of a diameter Referring to Figure 3, there is illustrated a graph showing the relation between the diameter It is to be noted that the spot like transparent portions may take the form of spot like holes formed through the material, and it has been confirmed that from the stand point of reducing the interference in the field of view, it is preferable to arrange the transparent portions 2 uniformly at such positions that the distance between their centres is between 2.0 and 5.5 mm, that is, they are distributed so as to form regular triangles. A preferred range of the length of these sides is between 3.0 and 5.0 mm. While it is more desirable to use a plastics material for forming the optical material 1 in the light of its physical properties, working properties during manufacture, cost and elegancy as mentioned previously, the invention is not necessarily limited to such plastics materials and the use of any material having the same effects is of course within the scope of the invention. Also, while a description has been made of suitable means for forming the holes or transparent portions 2 and the opaque portion 3, the invention is not limited to these means and a metal sputtering employing a mask, and like methods may also be used as effective means for the purpose. From the foregoing description it will be seen that in addition to an essential application of an article made by using as its material the optical material of the invention, e.g., an underlaying sheet, ruler, book cover, corner of a book cover, part of a bookmarker, cash card, member s card, commuter s ticket holder, watch band, shoulder belt for bags or tag, the optical material of this invention is not only effective for use as an objective observation optical material in place of sunglasses when its use is required to protect the user from the glare of ultraviolet rays such as the intense sunlight or the reflection from deep snow, but also effective to correct such defects of vision as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism or presbyopia. These effects are attained by the fact that the shape and size area of the plurality of spot like transparent portions 2, as well as their positions in the opaque portion 3, are specified such that the adjacent transparent portions overlap in the field of view, and there is no break in the field of view thereby providing a continuous field of view. On the other hand, a greater part of the ultraviolet rays in the field of view is blocked by the opaque portion 3 and also the field of view is continuous as mentioned previously. Thus, there is no obstruction from the vision point of view, thus permitting accurate viewing of an object, even in intense ultraviolet rays.
