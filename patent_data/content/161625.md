## Description
Title Process for producing multi layer parison This invention relates to a process for producing a parison having a multi layer structure, and more specifically to a process for producing a multi layer parison which is a precursor for obtaining a multi layer container excellent in transparency, gas barrier properties and mechanical strength. In recent years, hollow containers using thermoplastic resins have found widespread use as containers of cosmetics, foods beverage, etc. because of such advantages as light weight, safety to burst, etc. In particular, hollow containers made of polyethylene terephthalate have been rapidly developed by improvement in a biaxial stretching and blow molding technique. However, biaxially oriented containers made of thermoplastic polyester resins composed mainly of polyethylene terephthalate are not of perfect performance.Above all, in case the content with which the containers are filled is food requiring high gas barrier properties, there are drawbacks that taste of the content is lost for lack of gas barrier properties with respect to oxygen and carbon dioxide gas, and so forth. In order to remedy these drawbacks, an attempt has been already known to provide a three layer structure wherein two outer layers are made of a thermoplastic polyester resin and a central layer is made of a mxylylene group containing polyamide resin hereinafter called MX nylon being a thermoplastic resin having gas barrier properties Japanese Patent Publication No. 41181 83 and Japanese Laid open Patent Applications Nos.128517 82 and 128520 82 . Figure 8 illustrates a sectional view of said three layer structure. In the above described multi layer containers, the resins having the gas barrier properties, including MX nylon, are inferior in transparency and mechanical strength to Eenoplastic polyester resins. Accordingly, if the content of said resins with the gas barrier properties is too high, the performance of the containers is lost. It is therefore advisable to decrease the content of the resins with the gas barrier properties in such range as to seet the gas barrier performance required. However, in the above described known method it is hard to decrease the content of the resins with the gas barrier properties, above all, NI nylon to less than 30 t num by volume. If the content is forcibly decreased, the resin with the gas barrier properties is present only in part of a parison and a layer free of said resin is provided. When said parison is stretched and blow molded into a container, the gas barrier performance is extremely lowered. In view of the drawbacks of the conventional method, the present inventors made extensive studies and invented a process for producing a five layer structure wherein a central layer and two outer layers are made of a thensoplastic resin such as a thermoplastic polyester and two intermediate layers held between the central layer and outer layers are made of a thermoplastic resin having gas barrier properties, such as Mx nylon, by which the content of the thermoplastic resin with gas barrier properties can be decreased. That is, the present invention relates to a process for producing a multi layer parison having a fivelayer structure wherein a central layer and two outer layers are lade of a thenaoplastic resin resin A other than a thermoplastic resin resin B having gas barrier properties and two intermediate layers held between the central layer and two outer layers are made of the resinB, said process comprising successively injecting the molten resins A and B into a single mold in one injection molding cycle in the order of resin A, resin B and resinA using a molding machine having two injection cylinders for resins A and B under the conditions to meet the following equations l 4 , V1 2 V2 ... 1 0.5 cc sec V2 20 cc sec ... 2 0.7 Al A2 3.5 ... 3 BJ A1 A2 B1 0.25 ... 4 wherein V1 is an injection rate per parison of the resin A being injected first, V2 is an injection rate per parison of the resin A being injected last, Al is an injection capacity of the resin A being injected first, A2 is an injection capacity of the resin A being injected last, and B1 is an injection capacity of the resin B. One injection molding cycle in this invention means a series of steps comprising closing a mold, injecting resins into a cavity of the mold to fill the cavity with said resins, cooling the mold and opening the mold to withdraw a molded article. This invention is explained hereinafter by referring to the drawings. Figure 1 is a view illustrating a principle of a device for performing the process of this invention.Figure 2 is a sectional view of a parison obtained in this invention. Figure 3 7 are sectional views of parisons obtained under conditions deviated from those specified in this invention. Figure 8 is a sectional view of a parison obtained according to a conventional method.Figure 9 is a sectional view of a parison obtained with a less amount of the resin B in accordance with the conventional method. In Figure 1, 1 is a cavity, 2 is a gate, 3 and 3 are cylinders for injecting resins A and B 5, 6 the resins in the mold are shown by an oblique line or solid line yet the resins in the cylinders are not shown in particu lar , 4 and 4 are nozzles and 8 is a mold. In this case, a valve by which to switch resin channels may be disposed in a gate. In Figure 1, a portion at which the resinsLeaving the two injection cylinders meet each other is disposed within the mold but it may be placed without the mold. Figure 1 illustrates a state during the injection where the cavity is not completely filled with the resins, and an unfilled portion 7 remains. An injection molding method is now concretely explained. The resin a is first injected from the injection cylinder 3 and then the resin B from the injection cylinder 3 . The resin A is finally injected again from the injection cylinder 3 until the cavity is completely filled with the resin, and the pressure is maintained.After cooling is over, the mold is opened and a molded article is withdrawn. The inside of the cavity is completely filled with the resins for the first time when the last injection of the resin A is finished. At the preceding stage, the unfilled portion remains. Though amounts of resins injected at the respective stages will be later described, a filling percentage in the cavity at the state where the first injec don of the resin A ends is about 30 75 q√≥. Through the foregoing steps, a parison having a five layer structure is obtained such that the resin A injected first forms two outer layers, the resin B injected next forms two intermediate layers and the resin A injected finally forms the central layer. Figure 2 il lustrates a sectional view of the parison in this case. However, in order to obtain the parison having substantially the five layer structure as shown in Figure 2, it is necessary to inject the resins under the limited conditions, which will be explained below by referring to Figures 3 7 showing sectional views of parisons formed under various conditions. First, as for the injection rates of the resins, a relationship of V1 V2 shown in equation 1 , preferablyV1 V2 2 1.5 is required. Under the condition of V1 V2, the resin B does not extend in an opening direction on the left as shown in Figure 3 and stays midway. Moreover, the value of V2 has to be 0.5 20 cc sec shown in equation 2 , preferably 1.0 15 cc sec. Where the value is less than 0.5 cc sec, the resin is solidified at the gate before terminating the injection to make the inside of the mold unfilled. Where the value exceeds 20 cc sec, the resin B is all pushed in the opening direction as shown in Figure 4 so that it does not exist in the gate direction. Next, as for the proportions of the resins being injected, the resin A injected first and the resin A injected last have to meet a relationship of 0.7 A1 A2 3.5 shown in equation 3 , preferably 1 1i1 A2 2.5.With 0.7 A1 A2, the resin B is likely to be exposed to the surface in the opening as shown in Figure 5. With Al A2 3.5, the resin B does not extend up to the opening as shown in Figure 6. The resins A and B are to meet a relationship of Bl Al A2 Bl 0.25 shown in equation 4 , preferably 0.03 Bl Al A2 Bl S 0.2. With Bl Al A2 Bl 0.25, the amount of the resin B is too large and likely to stay in the vicinity of the opening. In the conventional method shown in Figure 8, the resin finally injected is a resin B which partially remains at a gate and is likely to be exposed to the bottom of the stretched container. In this instance, the bottom of the container becomes defective and is easy to break. Moreover, in case of MX nylon, etc. the product is whitened owing to moisture absorption and crystalliza tion, providing poor appearance. The undesirous conditions shown in Figures 5 7 are given for the same reasons. However, according to the present invention, the large amount of the resin A is finally injected as a central layer and the gate portion is therefore completely replaced with the resin A without exposure of said resin B. Since the opening and the bottom near the gate of the multi layer of the parison are not thinned on stretching the gas barrier properties of the container are not decreased even if the resin B is absent. In general, the thickness of the multi layer parison is 2 6 fl, preferably 3 5 mm. The thickness of the multi layer container biaxially stretched and blow molded is 200 500 , preferably 250 450 p. In this case, considering gas barrier properties, transparency, me chan ideal strength, etc., a ratio of the resin B based on the overall parison is 25 or less shown in equation 4 , preferably 3 20 . Examples of the resin A used in this invention include thermoplastic polyester resins, polyolefin resins, polycarbonates, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene. me thermoplastic polyester resins are most preferable. Exemples of the resin B used in this invention, i.e. the thermoplastic resin with the gas barrier properties include MX nylons, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin saponification products, polyacrylonitrile copolymer resins and polyvinylidene chloride resins. The MX nylons are most preferable. A combination of the thermoplastic polyester resins, above all, polyethylene terephthalate and NI nylons are most preferable because it is excellent in all of transparency, mechanical strength, injection molding properties and stretch blow molding properties. Such thermoplastic polyester resins are usually polyesters wherein more than 80 mo, preferably more than 90 mol of the acid component is terephthalic acid and more than 80 mol , preferably more than 90 mol of the glycol component is ethylene glycol. Examples of the residual acid component are isophthalic acid, diphenyl ether 4,4 dicarboxylic acid, naphthalene l,4 or 2, dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, sebasic acid, decane l,l0 dicarbolic acid and hexanydroterephthalic acid.Examples of the residual glycol component are propylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, cyclohexane dimethanol, 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyethoxyphenyl propane. Further available are polyester resins containing p oxybenzoic acid, etc. as an oxyacid. An intrinsic viscosity of these thermoplastic polyester resins is appropriately 0.55 or more, preferably 0.65 1.4. When the intrinsic viscosity is less than 0.55, a multi layer preform can hardly be obtained in a transparent, amorphous state. In addition, a mechanical strength of the resulting container is not enough. MX nylons are polymers containing at least 70 mol of structural units obtained from m xylylenediamine alone or a xylylenediamine mixture containing m xylylenediamine and p xylylenediamine in an amount of less than 30 of the total amount and an .w aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having 6 10 carbon atoms. Examples of the polymers include homopolymers such as poly m xylylene adipamide, poly m xylylene sebacamide and poly m xylylene speramide, copolymers such as a m xylylene p xylylene adipamide copolymer, m xylylene p xylylene pyperamide copolymer and m xylylene p xylylene azelamide copolymer, and copolymers of these homopolymer or copolymer components and aliphatic diamines such as hexamethylenediamine, cyclic diamines such as piperazine, aromatic diamines such as p bis 2 aminoethyl benzene, aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, lactams such as e caprolactam, w aminocarboxylic acids such as w aminoheptoic acid and aromatic aminocarboxylic acids such as faminobenzoic acid. In these polyesters may be incorporated polymers such as nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 610 and nylon 11. A relative viscosity of these MX nylons is suitably at least 1.5, preferably 2.0 4.0. In this invention, one or both of the resins A and B may be zixed, if necessary, with coloring agents, ultraviolet absorbers, antistatic agents, antioxidants, lubricants and nucleating agents within such range as not to impair the purpose of this invention. A multi layer container produced by heating a multi layer parison obtained according to the process of this invention to a stretching temperature and biaxially stretching and blow molding the heated parison through expansion with a stretching rod moving axially in a blowing mold and via blowing of a pressurized gas is excellent in gas barrier properties, transparency and mechanical strength. In this case, the stretching temperature may be approximately the sTe as that of a parison composed of a thermoplastic polyester resin unit, and a suitable range thereof is 70 130 C. It is advisable to stretch the parison 1 4 times in an axial direction and 2 7 times in a circumferential direction. A more preferable condition is 5 15 times in terms of a stretch ratio for area. The following Examples and Comparative Examples illustrate the present invention in more detail.
