## Description
This invention relates to a device for adjusting the fit, in particular of a ski boot. As is known, ski boots formed from a plastic material include a mostly rigid shell, wherein it is impossible to tailor the inside conformation to fit the varying skier s foot morphology. Thus, there may unavoidably remain voids within the shell, on account of which the skier s foot is liable to slip, which occurrence undoubtedly affects skiing adversely. Various expedients have been introduced to secure the skier s foot within a ski boot, but these often require considerable constructional complications, and are not always effective to ensure a perfect fit around the skier s foot. Thus the task of this invention is to solve the above problem by providing a device for adjusting the fit of a ski boot, which enables the interior space of the boot shell to be adjusted to fit the shape of a skier s foot, to prevent slipping of the foot and ensure a more effective contact thereof with the boot sole, as well as an improved responsiveness on the ski. Within this task it is an object of the invention to provide a device as indicated,which can be operated in a quick and effective manner after wearing a ski boot. Another object of this invention is to provide a device as indicated, which can allow a highly accurate adjustment while leaving the user free to select the magnitude of the locking action to be applied in accordance with his her own contingent requirements. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a device which can be readily installed, comprises a reduced number of componehts, and has a reasonably low cost. According to one aspect of the present invention the above task and objects as well as yet other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a device for adjusting the fit, in particular of a ski boot, characterized in that it comprises, located inside the shell of a boot at the upper front region of the foot, a band element extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of said shell and carrying a pressure element, said band element being fastened with one end to one side of said shell and having the other end thereof engaged with actuating means carried by the other side of said shell and made accessible from the outside of said shell. Further features and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of a device for adjusting the fit, in particular of a ski boot, according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying non limitative drawing, where Figure 1 shows schematically this device as mounted on the inner shoe of a ski boot Figure 2 is a perspective view of this device, incorporating a Maltese cross type of actuator Figure 3 is a sectional view of the device shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 illustrates this device as operated by means of a worm screw and Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of this device, as operated by means of a dua2 thread type of threaded bar. With reference to the cited figures, and in particular to Figures 1 to 3, the device for adjusting the fit, in particular for ski boots, according to the invention, comprises, located inside the shell of a boot, a band element 1 which extends transversely to the longitudinal direction of the shell and is placed within the shell above the boot inner shoe, generally indicated at 2. The cited band element carries a pressure element 3, which is located at the toe end and neck region of the skier s foot. The band element 1 is fastened, with one end, to one side of the shell, whilst its other end is engaged with actuating means carried on said shell, on the opposite side thereof, and made accessible from the shell outside. The cited actuating means advantageously comprise a altese cross element 10 rotatably supported on the shell and having, externally to the shell, an operating knob 11. The band element 1 is provided, at its end in engagement with the M raltese cross element, a small plate 12 with shaped seats 13, wherein actuating pegs 15 and check pegs 16 provided on the riialtese cross element will engage. To ensure a positive engagement of the 36altese cross element and plate 12, the plate is in practice made slideable in a seat defined on the interior of the boot by a small wall 18. With reference to Figure 4, the actuating means comprises here a worm screw 20 having a turning knob 21 which protrudes out of the shell, which knob engages, by a threaded portion thereof, a plurality of canted slots 22 provided at the end of the band element 1. Also in this instance, in order to maintain a stable connection between the worm screw 20 and band element 1, said band element is made slidable through a sleeve element 25 at the canted slots 21. In the embodiments described hereinabove, in order to adjust the fit as desired, it will be sufficient for the user to turn the knobs, 11 or 21, in one or the opposite directions to thus change the working length of the band element 1 and, accordingly, the position of the pressure element 3 which effects the adjustment of the fit. IEa.king reference to Figure 5, the cited actuating means comprises a threaded bar 30 supported rotatively on the boot and having, at one of its ends, a gripping knob 31 which protrudes out of the boot shell. Said threaded bar has opposite threads along its two halves, which are engaged by threaded seats, of course also oppositely threaded, in small blocks 32 having at the bottom an inclined surface 33. The inclined surfaces 33 act on inclined surfaces 34 of a shaped pusher 35 such that the rotation of the threaded bar 30 results in the translation of the blocks 32 in either direction, thus changing the position occupied by the shaped pusher 35. The shaped pusher 35 is connected to the threaded bar 30 by means of return springs 40, which practically hold the shaped pusher at all time in position and allow it to climb up toward the shell upper portion as the pusher is released. Also in this case, the user only has to operate the gripping knob and produce the translation in either direction of the blocks 32, with attendant translation of the shaped pusher 35 along a vertical plane, to achieve a desired adjustment of the fit. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular that the expedients proposed enable the user to adjust at will the boot fit, by simply rotating the knobs arranged on the shell exterior, while retaining the faculty of performing an extremely fine and accurate adjustment. The materials used, if compatible with the specific application intended, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any selected ones depending on individual requirements.
