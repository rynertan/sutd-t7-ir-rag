# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ETHANOL

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for producing ethanol which includes the steps of a continuously moving a feedstock slurry of starch and acid through a high intensity tubular starch hydrolyzer to produce a hydrolyzate in fluid form containing glucose, b fermenting the glucose containing fluid to form a fermentation product containing ethanol, c distilling the fermentation product to separate the ethanol from a distillation residue containing non fermented car bohydrate materials and, d recycling at least part of the obtained distillation residue as part of the starch and acid slurry feedstock to the hydrolyzer whereby a substantial portion of the recycled non fermented carbohydrate mate rials is hydrolyzed together with the starch to a fermentable glucose containing fluid.
