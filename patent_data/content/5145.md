# Process for preparing 5 2 bromoethylidene 2 3H 4a methyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8 hexahydronaphthalene 2 one and 5 ethenyl 2 3H 4a methyl 4,4a,7,8 tetrahydronaphthalene 2 one therefrom by dehydrobromination.

## Abstract
5 Ethenyl 4,4a,7,8 tetrahydro 4a methyl 2 3H naphthalenone, an intermediate useful in the total synthesis of steroids, is prepared by dehydrohalogenation of 5 2 bromo ethylidene 2 3H 4a methyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8 hexahydronaphthalen 2 one by a pyrolytic procedure or by means of dehydrohalogenating agents, for example, a mixture of lithium bromide and lithium carbonate.
