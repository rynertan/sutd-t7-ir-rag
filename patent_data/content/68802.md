# Method of, and apparatus for damping of stepper motor using non active windings.

## Abstract
In a disk drive system which uses as a stepper motor, over shooting of the desired final position is reduced by short cir cuiting the windings of the stepper motor which normally re main open circuit or are switched off. The short circuiting pro vides a current path for any EMF included in the unused wind ings. The effect is achieved by connecting a pair of transistors in parallel with each other and with each respective winding. The transistors are connected in opposite polarity to provide a short circuit regardless of the polarity of the EMF across the windings. The transistors are connected to a microprocessor which is programmed such that the windings are selectively short circuited and the short circuits are applied at a predeter mined time with regard to the step so that damping is opti mised. The microprocessor may be programmed to switch the transistors on and off as desired giving flexible timing to suit different conditions. One or more stepper motor steps may be treated in this manner.
