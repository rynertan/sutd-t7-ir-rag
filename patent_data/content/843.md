# Plasma discharge ion source.

## Abstract
It has been found that the proportions of the various ions produced by a plasma discharge source depends on the temperature of the plasma. In this invention means are provided increasing the temperature of the plasma. This is achieved by an arrangement 18, 34 which provides a containing field 32 which restrains the passage of electrons from the plasma to the anode 12 , both radially outwards and axially to the end walls 30 .
