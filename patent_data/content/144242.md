# Compound semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A compound semiconductor integrated circuit device includes a heterojunction bipolar transistor B which has three compound semiconductor layers 12, 13, 14 of alter nate conductivity types, one of which layers 14 provides a channel region or a channel electron supplying region of a field effect transistor F . In this way both bipolar transistors and FET transistors can be provided in one integrated circuit device.
