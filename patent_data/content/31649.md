## Description
CONTAINERS t HOLDERS THEREFOR FOR USE IN ELECTROSTATIC SPRAYING This invention relates to containers and holders therefor, and in particular to such containers and holders for use in the electrostatic spraying of liquids. In U.K. Patent 1569707, we have described an apparatus for the electrostatic spraying of liquids. This apparatus is of simple construction, with a low power requirement it has no moving parts and can readily be run off dry cells it is thus particularly suited for use as a hand held sprayer In applications where large power sources are not readily available for example, in spraying crops.Electrostatic spraying of crops also has advantages in promoting even coating of plants, with spray being attracted around behind foliage instead of coating only exposed surfaces and in reducing spray drift, which is at best wasteful and at worst hazardous to the environment. The apparatus disclosed in U.K. Patent No.1569707 comprises essentially a discharge nozzle a fieldintensifying electrode disposed around the nozzle a container for supplying liquid to be sprayed to the nozzle and a high voltage generator for applying a high voltage to the nozzle, the electrode being earthed. In this way a strong electric field may be produced between the nozzle and the electrode, sufficient to atomise liquid passing through the nozzle. This apparatus is particularly suitable for the application of pesticides at low or ultra low volume typically at a spray application rate in the range 0.5 to 10 litres spray liquid per hectare . Low and ultra low volume spraying have several recognised advantages, as well as being especially suitable where water is not readily available as a spray diluent, but they also have one disadvantage. Of necessity, they must use relatively concentrated pesticidal compositions. Such compositions frequently have a greater or lesser degree of human toxicity, and for this reason it is desirable that they should be handled as little as possible. A particular danger is the decantation of poisonous liquids into beverage bottles. A pesticide sprayer, to provide the best service, must be reliable and adaptable. Desirably it should be able to spray pesticides of several different kinds. Different pesticides come in different formulations, having different electrical properties, and requiring to be sprayed in differing droplet sizes to give optimum effect. In the apparatus of U.K. Patent 1569707 useful and convenient control over droplet size and spraying properties can be provided by varying the applied voltage but the size of the nozzle and its position relative to the surrounding electrode may also require adjustment to suit the formulation being sprayed. It is often difficult to do this reliably in the field.Also, pesticide sprayers spraytanks, spray lines and nozzles normally require careful cleaning between application of different pesticides otherwise, for example, traces of herbicide may damage crops being sprayed against fungal attack. The need for such cleaning is increased when formulations are to be sprayed electrostatically, since contamination may affect their electrical properties. Thorough cleaning may damage nozzles, leading to incorrect spray application. The object of the present invention is to provide containers suitable for use in electrostatic spraying apparatus of the kind described in U.K. Patent 1569707 which enable a number of the problems outlined above to be mitigated or overcome. According to the present invention, we provide a container for a liquid to be electrostatically sprayed, suitable for mounting on a holder carrying a high voltage generator, a power source, a field intensifying electrode and electrical connections for connecting the fieldintensifying electrode to one output terminal of the high voltage generator, the container having a spray nozzle at least part of the surface of which electrically conductive mounting means for locating the container on the holder with the nozzle adjacent the field adjusting electrode and insulated therefrom electrical connections from the nozzle to a contact on the mounting means so placed that when the container is located on the holder by the mounting means the contact can make connection with the other output terminal of the high voltage generator and a closure or seal for closing the nozzle prior to location on the apparatus. We further provide a holder suitable for receiving a container according to the invention which comprises a body carrying a high voltage generator, a power source therefor, a field intensifying electrode, electrical connections for connecting the electrode to an output terminal of the high voltage generator, and mounting means complementary to the mounting means on the container for locating the container on the holder with the spray orifice adjacent the electrode. We further provide a sprayer formed by the combination of a container according to the invention mounted upon a holder according to the invention.Throughout this specification, the term conducting surface is intended to include a semi conducting surface. Prior to mounting on the holder, the container nozzle requires to be sealed against the emission of liquid. One or more conventional sealing means may be employed, for example a screw cap or a metal foil seal over the nozzle, or both. The container seal may be adapted to be opened when, and preferably only when, located on the holder.Such opening may take place during such location, or subsequently furthermore, the opening may be actuated mechanically or electrically. Thus, during the action of mounting the container on to the spraying apparatus, a knife or spike on the holder may cut or pierce a metal foil over the nozzle of the container. The container nozzle may be sealed by a valve, e.g. a spring biassed ball valve which is opened during mounting by contact with a detent on the holder. With such a system the container orifice is automatically closed on removal from the apparatus which is particularly useful when the container still contains liquid. The same desirable end may also be accomplished by use of an electrostatic valve, of the type disclosed in our copending application Electrostatic Valves EPOApplication No 80302767, filed 12 August 1980 . Preferably means are provided on the holder for maintaining one output terminal of the high voltage generator at or near earth potential. Such means may be a conductor, for connection to earth, for example, a trailing earth wire dependant from the holder. Where such means are provided, it is preferred that the earthed terminal of the high voltage generator is arranged for connection to the fieldintensifying electrode rather than to the container nozzle. Charging of the spray is then by direct contact, rather than by induction, and there is a stronger electrostatic field transporting the spray to its earthed target. If desired, one of the two electrical connections of the high voltage generator terminals with the fieldintensifying electrode and the container nozzle may be through earth though a more direct connection is sometimes convenient. The field intensifying electrode may be of bare metal or may be wholly or partially covered with insulating material. For most efficient operation the container also requires a means of equalising the external and internal pressure during spraying, for example an air vent, or non rigid walls. Containers according to the invention may be filled with properly formulated spray liquid by the manufacturer, and after the containers are closed, the spray liquid will remain uncontaminated until it is actually sprayed. There is no need to clean spray tanks, spray lines or nozzles to avoid contamination, so different products can be sprayed successively without undue loss of time. Toxic hazards through handling by operators are minimised errors by field operators in mixing and dilution procedures are eliminated. After use, the containers according to the invention may be returned to the manufacturer for refilling or may be discarded. Containers may be made from one or more elements of plastics material by, for example, injection moulding or blow moulding, or a combination of the two.The conducting elements of the containers nozzle, contact and connections may be provided by metal inserts, or by application of conductive metallic coatings or paints to the container surface or by the use of partly conducting plastics. One suitable form of power source is an electrical storage battery. The amount of electrical energy required to atomise liquid is remarkably low. A typical example may be considered a vessel containing 500 ml of liquid to be sprayed at a rate of 0.1 ml per second, with a droplet size of about 100 microns, and a charge to mass ratio of 5 x 10 3 coulombs per kilgram. The current carried by droplets atomising from the nozzle is thus 0.5 microamperes.The required cell rating is considerably less than that of most readily available torch batteries. An example of another form of power source which may be used in the invention is a solar cell. Suitable high voltages for use in the invention range from about 1 to about 30 kilovolts, and most conveniently from about 5 to about 25 kilovolts. A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view 6f a container according to the invention Figure 2 is an end view of a container according to the invention Figure 3 is a vertical section through the container on the line AA of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a plan view of the holder Figure 5 is a plan view of the collar of the container Figure 6 is a circuit diagram showing the circuit formed when the container is mounted on the holder. Figures 7 11 illustrate a second container and holder according to the invention. Figure 7 is a vertical section through the nozzle and neck of the second container. Figure 8 is a horizontal section on the line A A in figure 7. Figure 9 is a vertical section through a holder for the second container. Figure 10 is a circuit design for the holder of figure 9. Figure 11 is a vertical section through a cap for the nozzle of figure 7. With reference generally to Figures 1 to 3 and 5, the container comprises a generally flask shaped body 1 of blow moulded high density polyethylene, the neck of which is in liquid tight sealed engagement with a collar 2 injection moulded from polyacetal. It contains a solution 40 of 10 by weight of an insecticide in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent. The collar 2 is formed of two concentric cylinders 3 and 4 joined near their ends to form an annulus.Within the inner cylinder 4 is a polyacetal plug 5 , whose external diameter is somewhat less than that of the internal diameter of the cylinder 4 . The plug 5 is held in place within the cylinder 4 by outwardly projecting lugs 6 . It thus forms, in cooperation with the cylinder 4 , an annular channel 7 of capillary dimensions through which spray liquid may pass. The plug 5 is also provided with a central bore carrying a polythene capillary tube 8 which extends upwardly into the body 1 of the container. The annular nozzle formed by the combination of the plug 5 and the cylinder 4 is closed against liquid leakage by sealing cap 9 shown in position only in Figure 3 . The rim 17 of the inner cylinder 4 is coated with electrically conductive paint to form an annular conductor.The conductive rim 17 is connected by an electrically conductive paint strip 18 , passing down the inside of the cylinder 4 and over the top rim of the collar, to a brass contact stud 19 on the outside of the collar 2 . To prevent current leakage through the spray liquid, the conductive strip 18 is protected within the body 1 of the container by insulating varnish. A projecting key 20 is also formed on the outside of collar 2 . With reference now principally to Figure 4, the holder for the container comprises a body 21 suitable for holding in the hand carrying a variable high voltage generator 22 233P, 0 20 kilovolts, 200 microamp module.The body 21 is of generally elongated form, and terminates in a ring 23 of a rigid plastics material, the inside of which is adapted to receive the collar 2 of the container. A key way 24 corresponds to the key 20 on the collar 2 . Around the base of the ring 23 is mounted a metal annulus 25 , which serves as a fieldintensifying electrode. A brass contact stud 27 is mounted on the inside of the ring 23 so as to be able to contact stud 19 on the container. The power source 26 is a bank of dry cells carried in the body 21 of the holder. The positive pole of the power source 26 is connected by an insulated electrical conductor 28 to a switch 29 , which, in the on position, leads via a conductor 30 to the positive input terminal of the high voltage generator 22 . The negative pole of power source 26 is connected via an insulated electrical conductor 31 to a conductor 32 for connection to earth the conductor 32 is a metal wire with a bare end for trailing along the ground. The stud 27 connects via an insulated electrical conductor 33 to the positive high voltage output terminal 34 of the generator 22 .The negative output terminal 35 of the generator 22 is connected to the earth wire 32 , as is the metal annulus 25 . In operation, the container is placed in an upright position, and the sealing cap 9 removed. The ring 23 of the holder is then placed over the collar 2 of the container, over which it is a push fit, and the two mating parts are pushed together. The ring 23 grips the collar 2 sufficiently tightly to hold the container in position the key 20 on the container cooperates with the key way 24 to hold the container in a position in which contacts 19 and 27 touch. The circuit so formed is shown inFigure 6. The holder is now used to invert the container over the target to be sprayed, and liquid starts to drip from the channel 7 . The switch 29 is at once turned to the on position. This permits current flow from the power source 26 to the generator 22 and this in turn causes a high potential conveniently 20 kilovolts to be conveyed from the terminal 34 via contacts 27 and 19 to the electrically conducting surface 17 of the cylinder 4 . A strong electrostatic field is thereby created between the charged nozzle 17 and the earthed metal annulus 25 , functioning as a field intensifying electrode. This causes liquid emerging adjacent to the surface 17 to atomise, and be projected downwardly as a fine spray, of controlled particle size, towards any desired target. As the liquid passes out of the container through the annular channel 7 , the decreasing pressure within the container is equalised by air passing up through the central capillary tube 18 . Spraying is stopped by turning off the switch 29 and turning the container mouth upwards. Various modifications to the foregoing apparatus will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The container illustrated is intended to be disposable. However, reusable containers may also be made. The device described includes a conductor for connection to earth in the form of a trailing bare metal wire. This has the disadvantage that it may become caught up or tangled. The device works best with an earth conection but it need not be of low resistance. The conductor for connection to earth may be, for example a metallised strip along the handle of the holder. When the operator grasps the handle, an electrical pathway to earth is formed through the operator s body. Though this pathway has high resistance, we have found that it is generally adequate. Experiments have shown that, with an arrangement of this kind, the voltage on the container electrode may be up to about one or two hundred volts above that of earth, even when the operator is wearing rubber boots in relatively dry conditions. Such a voltage on the electrode is little different from that of earth, relative to the potential on the nozzle of several thousand volts. The current flowing through the operator is so small that there is no danger to him whatever, nor can he even feel anything. A further embodiment of the invention, more suited to mass production using plastics moulding techniques, is illustrated in Figures 7 11. The container 48 , shown in figures 7 and 8, comprises a bottle 49 , formed by processes including blow moulding from clear polyethylene terephthalate, having a shoulder 50 with an exterior thread 52 and a neck 51 with an exterior thread 53 .The neck 51 carries an annular nozzle 54 threaded thereon. This nozzle is injection moulded from conductive plastics material nylon containing 308 by weight carbon black in two pieces 55 and 56 forming respectively the outer and inner wall elements of the nozzle 54 . Outer wall 55 comprises a tube 58 having at its upper end an enlarged skirt 59 carrying inner and outer threads 60 and 61 . From the upper end of skirt 59 , a resiliently deformable flange 63 extends outwardly. Below inner thread 60 a set of ratchet teeth 64 are formed round the inner circumference of skirt 59 .Thread 60 on skirt 59 mates with thread 53 on bottle 59 when the two are screwed together ratchet teeth 64 engage with a mating set of ratchet teeth 65 fixed in the outer lip of neck 51 of the bottle 49 . This prevents bottle 49 and nozzle 54 , once assembled, from being taken apart again. At the base of skirt 59 a circumferential wier 66 supports a resilient rubber 0 ring 67 this acts as a liquid tight seal between nozzle 54 and the lip of neck 51 . Tube 58 is formed with seven vertical ribs 68 , separated by channels 69 . Within tube 58 is carried inner wall element 56 of the annular nozzle 57 . This is also generally tubular in shape and comprises a bottom portion 70 which is a push fit into tube 58 , fitting snugly within it against ribs 68 a central radial flange 71 which abuts the heads 72 of the ribs 62 , and an upper portion 73 with a mouth 74 partially closed by a threaded bolt 75 which is a push fit therein. The mouth 74 has three castellations 76 which expose part of the thread of the nut 75 the inner bore of mouth 74 is smooth, not threaded. The lower end of bottom portion 70 is formed with a circumferential indentation forming an annular orifice 78 between inner and outer walls 55 and 56 . The channels 69 lead into this orifice 78 . Figure 11 shows a cap 80 formed of nylon which may be screwed on to nozzle 54 to retain liquid during carriage and storage. It comprises a skirt 81 externally milled with internal thread 82 for mating with the external thread 61 on the nozzle 54 . Skirt 81 has a dependent wall 86 fixed with an inner circumferential projection 83 which in use forms a liquid tight seal against the outer wall of tube 58 .From the base 84 of cap 80 a long nose 85 projects upwardly in use this has no sealing function, but fills most of the space between nut 75 and projection 83 so that the minimum of liquid is lost when cap 80 is removed. Figures 9 and 10 show a holder 90 for container 48 consisting of a plastics support 89 and a carrying handle 91 . The support 89 is of tough rigid non conducting plastics material e.g. glass filled nylon and comprises two short co axial hollow cylinders 92 and 93 connected by a sloping shoulder 94 . The upper cylinder 92 has an internal thread 95 which will receive and mate with the external thread 52 of bottle 49 . Lower cylinder 93 is wide enough . o admit nozzle 54 carrying cap 80 , with a small clearance. The bottom of cylinder 93 is formed with an outwardly directed radial flange 96 . Just above flange 96 , at the base of cylinder 93 , is a bare metal annulus 97 . At one side of support 89 is a large lug 98 , formed with a socket 99 for receiving the end of carrying handle 91 , a rod of insulating plastics material such as fibreglass .Within handle 91 are carried two electrical leads 100 and 101 , the former being connected to one output terminal of 25 KV high voltage generator 102 carried in the handle 91 , and the latter being connected to earth.Lead 100 is accommodated in blind bore 103 adjacent the interior surface of shoulder 94 , and makes contact with round headed self tapping metal screw 104 . Lead 101 passes through bore 105 and is connected to metal annulus 97 . As shown in the circuit diagram of figure 10, generator 102 is powered by four 1.5 volt flashlight batteries 106 through a spring loaded push button switch 107 . Generator 102 , batteries 106 and switch 107 are all mounted on handle 91 . The earth connection 108 is provided through a trailing bare wire twisted into in a plastic twine base. In use, bottle 49 is first filled with a suitable liquid for spraying e.g. a 10 by weight formulation of a fungicide in a hydrocarbon solvent, the formulation having a resistivity of 1 x 108 ohm cm and a viscosity of 5 centistokes, both measured at 20cm . Nozzle 54 is then screwed on to thread 53 , and ratchet teeth 64 and 65 engage, fixing nozzle 54 permanently in position. Cap 80 is then screwed on to thread 61 . The container 48 so formed is now transported to the site at which it is desired to use it. Here it is screwed into holder 89 , using threads 52 and 95 . Flange 63 contacts the head of screw 104 . Handle 92 is now used to hold container 48 nozzle downwards over the targe it is desired to spray, and cap 80 is removed. Liquid begins to drip out of annulus 78 , while air is sucked into the container up the central bore of insert 56 . To enter the container, air has to pass along the long helical groove formed between the thread of bolt 75 and the smooth inner surface of mouth 74 . The generator 102 is activated by depressing the switch 107 , thereby communicating a potential of 25 KV to the nozzle 54 via lead 100 , screw 104 and flange 63 . A powerful electric field is generated between the charged nozzle orifice 78 and the earthed conductor 97 . This draws out the liquid leaving the orifice 78 into ligaments, which break up into highly charged particles of uniform size, which are attracted to and evenly coat the target. The form of nozzle shown in Figures 7 11 produces a steady flow rate after a short period of the order of 45 seconds in which equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium flow rate for a liquid of given viscosity is dependent on the width and breadth of the channels 69 and the length and cross section of the helical air bleed channel. In the embodiment shown, the seven channels 69 are 0.3 mm deep and 1.6 mm wide, the annular orifice being 0.3 mm in width with an external diameter of 13 mm the path of the helical air bleed is about 9 10 cm long, with a cross section of about 0.4 sq. mm. and the resulting flow rate is about 0.07 ml second. For greater or lesser flow rates, it is simplest to change the number of channels 69 rather than their depth or thickness, e.g. to 4 or 16 channels to approximately halve or double the flow rate, respectively.As well as giving a steady flow rate, this nozzle is not sensitive to tilting and continues to operate satisfactorily when held at an angle of, e.g., 30 to the vertical. Accordingly, the invention further comprises a container for the electrostatic spraying of liquids including a vessel having a neck, an electricallyconductive nozzle mounted in said neck and having a body, a mouth for dispensing liquid from the vessel and an airbleed for feeding air into the vessel said body comprising vertically aligned co axial outer and inner tubes, the outer tube being shorter and having a height at least twice its diameter and said inner tube having an upper end extending at least into the neck of the vessel said mouth being formed by the radial gap between adjacent lower ends of the tubes ribs being provided on the surface of one tube to space it from the second tube and to form channels communicating with the vessel to deliver liquid therefrom to the mouth said air bleed comprising a bung supported within the bore of the upper end of said inner tube and a projecting helical thread between the bung and the bore providing an extended helical pathway through which air can enter the vessel. The apparatus of the invention has been described with particular reference to its use in pesticide spraying, in particular of compositions comprising pesticides in organic liquid carriers, for which it has special advantages.However, it also has advantages in respect to spraying of coatings or paints, for example by the home decorator.Holders for the container are conveniently adapted for holding in the hand but they may also comprise means for self propulsion, e.g. being carried in or forming part of vehicles such as tractors or aircraft, when they may support more than one container. In this case, the power source may be a battery or generator carried in the vehicle.
