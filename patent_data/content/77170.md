# Process for removal of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides from waste gases.

## Abstract
A process for removal of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides from waste gases by contacting the waste gases with a particulate material comprising an alkaline earth based absor bent for sulfur oxides. Essential features are a reaction temper ature of 85 145 C, a maximum value of 3 for the ratio of nitro gen oxides to sulfur oxides, and the presence of oxygen and moisture. In its preferred form the process comprises a spray drying absorption reaction followed by particle separation in a bag house. Removal efficiency is improved by the presence of minor amounts of sodium sulfite together with the alkaline earth based absorent. Also a special conveyance of material may be applied to improve efficiency.
