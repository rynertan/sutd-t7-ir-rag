# Airspeed sensing systems.

## Abstract
A cylindrical tube 1 is open at both ends but divided into two portions 3 and 4 by a barrier 2 having an aperture 7 therein. Side branches 5 and 6 are connected to the tube 1 either side of the barrier 2 respectively, the side branches 5 and 6 leading to a pressure transducer for deriving an airspeed indication. One open end of the tube 1 is arranged to face into an airflow so that a pressure difference exists between the two portions 3 and 4 , the pressure difference being measured by the pressure trans ducer through side branches 5 and 6 . The barrier 2 may have no aperture 7 , the portions 4 and 5 then being connected by a restricted passage 10 disposed between the sides of the portions 3 and 4 or between the side branches 5 or 6 . The outside air temperature may be derived by the provision of a resistive element 11 with the restricted passage 10 .
