# Deceleration and pressure sensitive proportioning valve.

## Abstract
A proportioning valve in a master cylinder housing 12, 112 is pressure responsive to control the flow of fluid to a wheel brake cylinder. The proportioning valve is connected to a fluid channel 31, 131 opening into the master cylinder reservoir 13, 113 , a second valve 34, 134 being disposed at the opening 32, 132 and being engaged by an inertia sensitive ball 40, 140 located on a ramp 17, 117 . The ball 40, 140 is responsive to deceleration of the vehicle where by the ball 40, 140 moves up the ramp 17, 117 and permits the second valve 34, 134 to close. Closure of the second valve 34, 134 prevents fluid communication between the fluid reservoir 13, 113 and the proportioning valve in order to vary the outlet pressure P
