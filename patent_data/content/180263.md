## Description
The invention relates to a method for controlling vascular withering diseases in plants, in particular trees, by prophylactic or curative treatment of the plants with a systemic fungicide. Vascular withering diseases, which are caused by dimorphous or polymorphous fungi, occur in various plants and normally lead to the death of the affected plant. Alongside vascular withering diseases in, for example, tomato and oak, the occurrence of Dutch elm dis ease causes great concern since this disease has now assumed world wide proportions. Dutch elm disease is caused by a dimorphous fungus, In North West Europe Dutch elm disease is princi pally spread by the large elm bark beetle In addition to the abovementioned dimorphous fungus of the family of The controlling of vascular withering diseases such as Dutch elm disease is mainly based on removing and destroying the affected plants such as the affected elm trees, severing underground root connections, con trolling beetles, responsible for the spread of the vascu lar withering diseases, by means of insecticides, and controlling the fungi themselves by means of fungicides. A great deal of research has been devoted to the effectiveness of certain benzimidazole 2 yl carbamates in controlling These systemically active fungicides can be em ployed in various ways. Initially, these substances were used by moistening the root zone of the trees with a solu tion of the fungicide. In general, the fungicide is taken up efficiently by the roots but for effective control large quantities have to be employed, amounting, for ex ample, to more than 40 g m² in the case of benomyl. This method of use has been abandoned since it threatened excessive danger to the environment through, for example, damage to other organisms in the soil. Spraying of leaves, branches and trunks of the trees, especially of large trees in towns, is extraordinarily difficult to carry out, though some suc cess has been achieved therewith. The currently most widely used method is the injection of roots, root stumps and especially the trunk of elms with a solution of a systemic fungicide. In this method, again, high concen trations have to be used in order to achieve a satisfac tory effect. High fungicide concentrations are, however, not tolerated well by elm trees. Moreover, Moreover, Biological Control of Dutch Elm Disease by It has now been found that fungicides which inhibit sterol biosynthesis can be successfully employed for con trolling vascular withering diseases in plants, especially for controlling Dutch elm disease. In fact, sterol biosyn thesis inhibitors appear to act, even in very low doses, on, for example The present invention thus relates to controlling vascular withering diseases in plants, caused by dimorphous or polymorphous fungi, by means of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors. The method according to the invention can, if desired, be combined with the abovementioned bacterio logical control of The sterol biosynthesis inhibitors which can be used in the method according to the invention belong to various chemical categories and can therefore not be de fined in terms of a general formula encompassing all com pounds. Whether a chemical compound belongs to the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors can be determined in a simple manner, as follows The use of all compounds known as sterol bio synthesis inhibitors, and also of preparations based there on, for controlling vascular withering diseases in plants, especially for controlling Dutch elm disease, falls within the scope of the invention. A survey of the sterol bio synthesis inhibitors already examined for control of fungi, especially of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, is given by A. Fuchs and M.A. de Waard in Fungicide Resistance in Crop Protection by J. Dekker and S.G. Georgopoulos, Pudoc, Wageningen 1980, pages 71 86 and 87 100. Sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicides which can be used accor ding to the invention include Exceptional results have been obtained with fenpro pimorph and tridemorph as morpholine compounds, with pro chloraz, triflumazole and imazalil as imidazole compounds and with propiconazole and etaconazole as triazole com pounds. These compounds are employed preferentially in the method according to the invention. The method according to the invention for control ling, for example, Dutch elm disease is carried out in a conventional manner, in general by treating, for example, elms which are in danger of becoming infected by The preparations to be employed for controlling vascular withering diseases in plants, especially Dutch elm disease, in accordance with the invention, and which also fall under the scope of the invention, can possess any desired form provided the active substance can be absorbed therefrom by the tree. There follows below a description of the The EC 50 value is the effective concentration in 50 growth inhibition a concentration at which growth is 50 inhibited relative to the control . The MIC value is the minimal inhibitory concen tration the lowest concentration at which no microscopi cally perceptible growth occurs . The The MIC values and EC 50 values were determined by measuring the spread of the fungus on Petri dishes con taining malt agar as the nutrient medium OXOID malt extract 3 , K₂HPO₄ 0.4 , KH₂PO₄ 0.1 , Difco agar 1.5 . The dishes were inoculated with a piece of infected agar obtained from a dish where the fungus had grown for 8 days. The inoculum piece was cut by means of a sterile cork borer diameter 4 mm , under sterile conditions, from the edge of the colony and placed with the infected face on the dish to be inoculated. Incubation was carried out at 24 C in a dark place. The inhibitors were added to the still just liquid agar medium by means of solutions, of graded concentra tion, in acetone, ethanol or distilled water, the final concentration of solvent being at most 1 . The relevant solvent was added to the blank sample. Thereafter the liquid was poured into Petri dishes and after it had gelled the dish was inoculated in the manner described above. The concentration range of each substance was between 0.05 and 50 ug ml with successive steps of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and so on. The EC 50 and MIC values were determined 14 days after inoculation. The results of the EC 50 and MIC determinations are shown in Table A below. In the field tests, the following varieties of elm, sensitive to Dutch elm disease, were used Ulmus Hollandica x Belgica HB Ulmus americana Ua The elms used for the tests were divided into the three following size categories In the tests according to the invention, the elms were inoculated with the aggressive strain The following inoculation operations were carried out for the abovementioned size categories of the elms For size category small 1 inoculation was carried out in one branch. For size category medium , 2 inoculations were carried out in one branch. For size category large , 2 inoculations per branch were carried out in 4 branches. In the tests according to the invention, fenpropimorph or a preparation called Corbel a spray preparation of fenpropimorph 75 active substance was employed after dilution with tap water sterile, except in the case of pressure injection . For trees of size categories small and medium , the method of absorption via the trunk wall was employed. For this, a hollow chisel 8 mm wide was forced into the tree to a depth of about 0.5 cm at a height of 5 10 cm, immediately after which 0.1 0.3 ml of fungicide solution was gradually fed to the tip of the chisel. This solution was normally absorbed by the tree within a few minutes. More especially, in the case of the small trees the fungicide was applied at 1 or 2 points and in the case of the trees belonging to the medium size category it was applied at 3 to 5 points depending on the diameter of the tree. For the trees of the large size category, 0.5 1 litre of Corbel solution was injected. This injec tion was effected by pressure injection at a height of 20 30 cm, for which about 2 cm deep holes were drilled with an 8 mm drill over 6 to 8 cm of the girth of the tree. Hollow plugs so called maple leaf taps were fitted into the holes obtained, and Corbel solution was injected via these plugs over 40 to 90 minutes under a pressure of 1 1.2 atmospheres gauge. After the inoculation and the application of fungicide, the development of the disease of the elms was assessed at regular intervals on the basis of the develop ment of symptoms. For this, the following disease index was employed Tables B, C and D below show the results obtained in the tests according to the invention. From these tests it can be deduced that in the case of small elm trees HB a prophy lactic fungicide treatment prevents infection with
