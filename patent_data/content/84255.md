# DRIVE AXLE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A drive axle assembly suitable for civil engineering plants includes a fixed spindle 33 , a nonrotatable spacer ring 37 disposed about the spindle and a drive hub 34 rotatably mounted on the spindle by bearings, one of which abuts the spacer ring 37 . The spacer ring 37 has a brake applying fluid inlet 100 to an interior passage 101 which opens to a first sealed annular cavity 107 between the spacer ring and the hub. The exterior of the spacer ring 37 defines in conjunction with the drive hub 34 a second low pressure cavity 128 therebetween enclosed by a radial face seal having a rotating portion 130 disposed in the hub and a nonrotating portion 129 disposed in the spacer ring. Lubricating and cooling fluid is pumped through the second cavity 128 to cool the face seal and continues through passages 135 143 in the drive hub to provide a nearly continuous flow to the drive and brake components in the hub assembly. The location of the brake apply cavity 107 interiorly adjacent the lower pressure lubricating cavity 128 minimizes the effect of small leakages past the seals of high pressure in the brake apply cavity.
