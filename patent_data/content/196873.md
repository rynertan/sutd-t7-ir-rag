# Diagnostic testing for micro organisms.

## Abstract
A method of testing a fluid sample for the presence of antibodies against a micro organism, which comprises con tacting the sample with fixed cells or fragments of cells infected with the micro organism, and determining the presence of antibody bound to the cell associated antigens, in which the determination is by virtue of a visible colour change at the site of the antibodies, For use in a testing method of this type, a test component comprises upper and lower layers, in which the upper layer has an array of apertures through which discrete areas on the lower layer are exposed, and in which the lower layer carries, in some at least of the discrete areas, fixed cells or cell fragments infected by a micro organism.
