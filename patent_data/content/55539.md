# Thermal printer drive circuit and a thermal printer provided therewith.

## Abstract
A drive circuit for a thermal printer which prints characters on a printing medium by selectively applying current to heat generating elements 60 comprises a current application control circuit 63 controlling the application of current to the heat generating elements, and a time control circuit 56 capable of varying the period of time for which the current application control circuit is rendered operative. The time control circuit comprises a charging circuit which is a series circuit having a constant voltage device 44 , a resistor 48 and a capacitor 50 , a discharging circuit 51 connected in parallel to the charging circuit, and a switching circuit 53 which is rendered conductive and non conductive selectively in dependence upon the charge on the capacitor. The charging circuit is connected between the terminals of a power supply 41 such as a battery from which current is provided to the heat generating elements.
