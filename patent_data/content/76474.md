# Automotive internal combustion engine with bearing beam structure.

## Abstract
An automotive internal combustion engine 10 compris es a cylinder block 12 having a plurality of bearing sections 22 , and a bearing beam structure 26 secured to the bottom part of the cylinder block. The bearing beam structure 26 includes a plurality of main bearing cap sections 28 each of which associates with each cylinder block bearing section 22 to rotatably support the journal of a crankshaft. First and second beam sections 32A,32B are formed at the upper corner portions of each bearing cap section 28 to securely connect the bearing cap sections with each other. Additional ly, first and second side wall sections 36A,36B are respec tively formed along the opposite side portions of each bearing cap section 28 to securely connect the bearing cap sections with each other. The first and second side wall sections 36A,36B are integral with the first and second beam sections, respectively. Therefore, vibration of the bearing beam structure 26 and the cylinder block 12 can be effectively suppressed, thereby achieving total engine noise reduction.
