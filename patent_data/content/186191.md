## Description
The present invention relates to a curable resinous composition comprising an epoxy resin and an organic elastomeric polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group in a molecule. More particularly, it relates to a curable resinous composition comprising an epoxy resin, an organic elastomeric polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group in a molecule, a silicone compound having a silicon containing reactive group and a functional group reactive with an epoxy group, and a curing agent for the epoxy resin, which affords a cured product having improved mechanical properties such as flexibility, impact resistance, toughness and strength. An epoxy resin finds various applications such as a molding material, an adhesive, a coating, a plywood, a laminate and the like. However, in these applications, it generally has a drawback such that it affords a cured product having brittleness and poor peeling strength. An organic elastomeric polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group in a molecule has such an interesting characteristic that it can be cured even at a room temperature to give an elastomer. However, the cured elastomer has poor strength, which prevents its wide application. JP A 59 24771 discloses a one component room temperature curable sealant composition which comprises a polyether polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group, a curing agent, and a partial addition condensation product which includes inter alia an epoxy resin and a compound having a silicon containing reactive group and a functional group reactive with an epoxy group. An object of the present invention is to provide a curable resinous composition comprising an epoxy resin and an organic elastomeric polymer having a silicon containing reactive group by which the brittleness and peeling strength of the epoxy resin and strength of the organic polymer are improved. Accordingly, the present invention provides a curable resinous composition comprising wherein said silicon containing reactive group is a group of the formula wherein X is a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group, R¹ is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an organosiloxy group, a is 0, 1, 2 or 3, b is 0, 1 or 2 provided that the total of a and b is at least 1, and m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 18, a weight ratio of A to B being from 1 100 to 100 1 and a weight ratio of A B to C being from 100 0.1 to 100 20. The present invention is based on the finding that the addition of the silicone compound C to a composition of the organic elastomeric polymer A and the epoxy resin B is very important to improve brittleness of the epoxy resin and strength of the polymer A . Specific examples of the organic elastomeric polymer having at least one silicon containing reactive group in a molecule A are polyethers prepared by ring opening polymerization of cyclic ethers e.g. propyleneoxide, ethyleneoxide, tetrahydrofuran polyesters prepared by polycondensation of a dibasic acid e.g. adipic acid and glycol or ring opening polymerization of lactons ethylene propylene copolymers polyisobutylene and copolymers of isobutylene with isoprene polychloroprene polyisoprene and copolymers of isoprene with butadiene, styrene, acrylonitrile polybutadiene and copolymers of butadiene with styrene, acrylonitrile polyolefins prepared by hydrogenating polyisoprene, polybutadiene or isoprene butadiene copolymers polyacrylates prepared by radical polymerization of acrylate e.g. ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and copolymers of acrylate with vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene, ethylene graft polymers prepared by polymerizing a vinyl monomer in the organic elastomeric polymer A polysulfides and the like. Among them, preferable are polyethers comprising repeating units of the formula R O wherein R is a C₁ C₄ alkylene group e.g. polypropyleneoxide and the like graft polymers prepared by polymerizing a vinyl monomer e.g. acrylate, styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate in the presence of polyether e.g. polypropyleneoxide polyalkyl acrylate or copolymers of at least 50 by weight of alkyl acrylate with vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene, ethylene, since they can introduce the silicon containing reactive group at a chain end of the molecule and are suitable for the preparation of a liquid polymer in the absence of a solvent. Particularly, polypropyleneoxide is preferable since it imparts water resistance to the cured product and is cheap and easily handled as a liquid material. The silicon containing reactive group is represented by the formula wherein X is a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group, R¹ is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an organosiloxy group, a is 0, 1, 2 or 3, b is 0, 1 or 2 provided that the total of a and b is at least 1, preferably from 1 to 4, and m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 18. When X is the hydrolyzable group, the group I is cross linked through hydrolysis by water and a silanol condensation reaction in the presence or absence of a catalyst for the silanol condensation. When X is a hydroxyl group, the group I is cross linked through the silanol condensation reaction in the presence or absence of a catalyst for silanol condensation. Specific examples of the hydrolyzable group are a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group, an acyloxy group, a ketoximate group, an amino group, an amide group, an aminoxy group, a mercapto group, an alkenyloxy group. Among them, the alkoxy group is preferable since it is mildly hydrolyzed and easily handled. The silicon containing reactive group has at least one silicon atom. When the silicon atoms are bonded through siloxane linkages, the silicon containing reactive group preferably not more than 20 silicon atoms. In the formula I , when R¹ is the organosiloxy group, it may be an triorganosiloxy group of the formula Among the silicon containing reactive group I , a group of the formula wherein R¹ and X are the same as defined above, and a is 1, 2 or 3 is preferable. The silicon containing reactive group I chemically bonds to the backbone chain of the organic elastomeric polymer. Although possible, it is not preferable for the silicon containing reactive group to be bonded to the backbone chain through an bond structure of the formula Si O C , since such structure tends to be cleavaged by water. A preferable bonding structure between the silicon atom of the reactive group and the backbone chain is, for example, a structure of the formula Si C . Most preferably, the reactive group is bonded to the backbone chain in the following chemical structure wherein R¹, X, a, b and m are the same as defined above. R² is a hydrogen atom or a C₁ C₂₀ monovalent organic group R³ is a C₁ C₂₀ divalent organic group and c is 0 or 1. The silicon containing reactive group may be introduced in the organic elastomeric polymer by following manners Specific examples of the reaction 4 are shown in following Table. Specific examples of the polymer having the functional group Y are polyetherpolyols comprising repeating units of the formula R O wherein R is a C₂ C₄ alkylene group e.g. polypropylenepolyol, polyethylenepolyol, polytetramethylenediol polyesterpolyols prepared by polycondensation of a dibasic acid e.g. adipic acid and glycol or ring opening polymerization of lactons polyols or polycarboxylic acids of polyisobutylene polyols or polycarboxylic acids of polybutadiene or copolymers of butadiene with styrene, acrylonitrile and the like polyols of polyolefins prepared by hydrogenating polyisoprene or polybutadiene polymer having an isocyanate functional group prepared by reacting the above polyols or polycarboxylic acids with polyisocyanate polymers having an ethylenically unsaturated bond prepared by reacting the above polyols with a halogen containing ethylenically unsaturated compound. Among them, preferable are those having the functional group Y at the chain end of the molecule. Specific examples of the silicon containing compound having the functional group Y are amino group containing silanes e.g. γ 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ 2 aminoethyl aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the like mercapto group containing silanes e.g. γ mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane and the like epoxysilanes e.g. γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, β 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane ethylenically unsaturated silanes e.g. vinyltriethoxysilane, γ methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ acryloyloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane chlorine containing silanes e.g. γ chloropropyltrimethoxysilane isocyanate containing silanes e.g. γ isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane, γ isocyanatepropylmethyldimethoxysilane and hydrosilanes e.g. methyldimethoxysilane, trimethoxysilane, methyldiethoxysilane . Among the combinations of the polymer having the functional group Y and the compound having the functional group Y , i a combination of the polymer having an isocyanate group and the amino group or mercapto group containing silane and ii a combination of the polymer having an ethylenically unsaturated group and the hydrosilane are preferable. Among the combination ii , a combination of polypropyleneoxide having an allylether group at the chain end and the hydrosilane is particularly preferable. In the combination ii , a silyl group can be introduced in the polymer by a hydrosilylation reaction in the presence of a platinum catalyst. The organic polymer A has at least one, preferably 1.2 to 6 silicon containing reactive groups in a molecule on the average. When the number of the silicon containing group in a molecule is less than one on the average, the composition of the invention is not effectively cured and the improvement of the properties is not satisfactorily achieved. Preferably, the silicon containing reactive group is attached to the chain end of the organic polymer molecule, because the terminal silicon containing reactive group elongates the chain length between the adjacent cross linking sites in the cured product so that, on one hand, the brittleness of the epoxy resin is more effectively improved, and on the other hand, the elastomeric cured product comprising predominantly the polymer A has better strength. The molecular weight of the organic polymer A is usually from 500 to 50,000, preferably from 1,000 to 20,000 since in this molecular weight range, the polymer is in a liquid state. The silicon containing reactive group having a silicon atom to which a hydroxyl group is attached may be prepared by hydrolyzing the silicon containing reactive group having a silicon atom to which a hydrolyzable group is attached. Preferable examples of the organic polymer A are disclosed in US A 3,408,321, 3,453,230 and 3,592,795, Japanese Patent Publication No. 32673 1974, Japanese Patent Kokai Publication unexamined Nos. 156599 1975, 73561 1976, 6096 1979, 13767 1980, 13768 1980, 82123 1980, 123620 1980, 125121 1980, 131021 1980, 131022 1980, 135135 1980, 137129 1980, 179210 1982, 191703 1983, 78220 1984, 78221 1984, 78222 1984, 78223 1984 and 168014 1984.

The amount of the curing agent D varies with the kinds of the epoxy resin and or the curing agent. Usually, 0.1 to 300 parts by weight of the curing agent D is used based on 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin B . The resinous composition according to the present invention contains the silicone compound having a silicon containing reactive group and a functional group reactive with an epoxy group C as one of the essential components. Examples of the functional group reactive with the epoxy group are a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, a mercapto group, an epoxy group and a carboxyl group. The silicon containing reactive group is the same as that of the organic polymer A . Particularly, the alkoxysilyl group is preferable due to its good handling properties. Specific examples of the silicone compound C are amino group containing silanes e.g. γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ aminopropyltriethoxysilane, γ aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ 2 aminoethyl aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ 2 aminoethyl aminopropyltriethoxysilane, γ ureidopropyltriethoxysilane, N β N vinylbenzylaminoethyl γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ anilinopropyltrimethoxysilane mercapto group containing silanes e.g. γ mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ mercaptopropylmethyldiethoxysilane epoxy group containing silanes e.g. γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane, β 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane carboxysilanes e.g. β carboxyethyltriethoxysilane, β carboxyethylphenylbis 2 methoxyethoxy silane, N β N carboxymethylaminoethyl γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane . The silane compound may be used alone or as a mixture with at least one other silane compound. A weight ratio of the epoxy resin B to the organic polymer A is from 100 1 to 1 100. When the amount of the organic polymer A is less than the lower limit, impact strength or toughness of the cured product is not desirably improved. When the amount of the organic polymer A exceeds the upper limit, the strength of the cured product is insufficient.
