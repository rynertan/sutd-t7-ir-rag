# Prevention of PVC polymer buildup in polymerization reactors using oxalyl bis benzylidenehydrazide and alumina.

## Abstract
Polymer buildup in polymerization reactions during vi nyl chloride polymerizations is greatly reduced by applying a water dispersion of alumina and oxalyl bis benzylidene hydrazide OABH to the reactor surfaces exposed to the polymerization medium prior to carrying out the polymeri zation. Long term effects of the buildup preventor can be obtained by applying a caustic wash to the reactor walls, prior to applying the oxalyl bis benzylidenehydrazide and alumna dispersion. The effect of the OABH alumina and caustic is synergistic since the preventative effect is grea ter than either material used alone.
