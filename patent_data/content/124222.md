# Monochrome compatible color slow scan television system.

## Abstract
A method and system for translating between three com plementary color component slow scan video signals and a composite color slow scan video signal containing a luminance information signal within a visible line interval of each slow scan video signal line and a chrominance information signal within the non visible portion of each slow scan video signal line. The chrominance information signal includes during the non visible portions of alternate slow scan video signal lines, a first color difference signal derived by subtracting the luminance informa tion signal from one of three complementary color slow scan video signals and a second color difference signal derived by subtracting the luminance information signal from another of three complementary color slow scan video signals. The three complementary color component slow scan video signals are translated into the composite color slow scan video signal for transmission. Upon reception, the composite signal is translated into the three complementary signals for provision to a three memory slow to fast scan converter.
