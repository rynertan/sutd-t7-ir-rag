## Description
FLEXIBLE HIGH TENSION CORD FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE 3BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a high tension cord for supplying high voltage electrical energy from. an ignition coil to a distributor and spark plugs mounted on an internal combustion engine.Generally, such a high tension cord is disposed in an engine compartment and it is necessarily subject to muddy water, or salt water in the cold weather area where salt is scattered on roads to melt snow or ice.When muddy water or salt water is poured on the conventional high tension cord, stray capacitance between the central conductor of the high tension cord and the ground may greatly increase lowering generated voltage of the ignition coil. SUllRY OF THE INVENTIONIt is a main object of the present invention to provide a flexible high tension cord, the stray capacitance of which may not significantly in crease even when muddy water or salt water is poured on the cord. In this connexion it is important to provide corona free and long life high tens ion cord structure comprising an elongated conductor, a medium layer composed of insulating gas filled bubbles and a cover insulator of high voltage resistivity thereby reducing total permittivity of the high tension cord.Other objects and features of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following specification and drawing.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe attached drawing is a longitudinal sectional view of a high tension cord structure according to the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENTNow, a preferred embodiment according to the present invention will be explained with referrence to the attached drawing. In the drawing, a central conductor 1 preferably made of resistive material containing carbon for suppressing the generation of radio noises is covered by a medium layer 2 which contains a large number of bubbles 2a of sulphurfluoride SF6 gas evenly distributed in 6 nylon or polyamide.6 nylon is one of good materials for keeping gases therein.Sulphurfluoride gas has high voltage resistivitys, i.e. the breakdown voltage thereof is 90 kV 10 mm, which is more t n three times as much as the resistivity of the air. Sulphurfluoride gas is effective to suppress the generation of a corona discnarge. F wever, the specific permittivity of sa phur fluoride gas is nearly equal to that of the air.i.e. to 1. As the gas content ratio of the medium ayer is increased, the specific permittivity cf the layer becomes close to one. Since the gas ks contained in a large number of separate small bubbles evenly distributed in the layer, it is very easy to cut the layer to a suitable length without releasing the gas therefrom. Seleniumfluoride gas SeF6 and sulphuroxide gas so2 have also a high voltage resistivity, a corona suppressing effect and a low specific permittivity, and they could be substituted for sulphurfluoride gas. An external in E ulator 3a of silicon rubber covers the outer surface of the medium layer 2 so as to ensure high voltage endurance of the cord and protect the medium layer from external injury. Tne stray capacitance for the unit length of the high tension cord according to the present invention with muddy water or salt water thereon may be given as follows EMI3.1 wherein 0 Zoois the permittivity of a vacuum,i.e. 8.855 x 10 12 F m, and 2 are respectively the specific 1 2 permittivity of the media layer 2 and the cover insulator 3, 1 2 and r3 are respectively the radii of the central conductor 1, the medium layer 2 and the cover insulator.If each value is given as follows 1 0.75x10 m, t2 2.25xIO3m, 3 5.00x10 3m, 1 1 and2 5.OO, then 5.00, then C 44 pF m. In the above case, the breakdown voltage of the high tension cord is nearly equal to that of the cord solely having a cover insulator, which is 7 mm in diameter i. e. 3 3.5 .If the medium layer is replaced by the same material as the cover insulator, the stray capacitance becomes 147 pF m, since the total permittivity of the high tension cord is increased due to the above replacement.Further, if the medium layer is composed of airfilled bubbles, the outer diameter of the cover insulator should be increased so as to have the same breakdown voltage as SF6 gas filled bubbles. In this case, however, a corona discharge may take place causing deterioration of the insulating material.According to the present invention, since the spaces of the bubbles are filled with high voltageinsulating gas such as SF6, the deterioration of the insulating material due to a corona discharge is effectively prevented by using a highly reliable high tension cord.
