# A dual in line socket assembly.

## Abstract
A dual in line socket assembly 10 is disclosed which includes an insulator block 12 having a plurality of primary holes 14 therein, each hole receiving an electrical socket 16 . The sockets 16 are adapted to receive pins from integrated circuit chips. At least one of the primary holes 16 has a secondary hole or slot 42 drilled adjacent and contiguous thereto for receiving an electrical lead 26 . The electrical lead 26 is connected to a circuit element 22 and the lead 26 forms an interference fit with a corresponding adjacent socket 16.
