# Method for the preparation of melamine.

## Abstract
An improved method for the preparation of melamine by the conversion of urea and or thermal decomposition products thereof. The urea and or thermal decomposition products are converted to melamine in the presence of a gas mixture containing ammonia and carbon dioxide in a reaction zone containing a fluidized bed of catalytically active material. Melamine is desublimated from the melamine containing gas mixture in a desublimation zone by a dry capture method leaving a desublimator off gas mixture of ammonia, carbon dioxide and gaseous impurities. A major portion of this desublimator off gas mixture is compressed and recirculated to the reaction zone as fluidizing gas for the bed of catalytically active material, without intervening treatment to remove gaseous impurities from the desublimator off gas.
