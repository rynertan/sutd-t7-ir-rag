# Non contact sensor for determining moving flat steel strip shape profile.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for monitoring the flatness characteristic of a moving electrically conducting strip of material by continuously measuring the change in capaci tance between the strip surface and a fixed point adjacent the surface. The capacitance is measured by means of a sensor 1 having an active plate 7 surrounded by a guard plate 2 for eliminating stray capacitance, both plates 2, 7 being impressed with a high frequency signal. Changes in capaci tance associated with both plates are eliminated while changes in capacitance associated with only the active plate are converted to a voltage proportional to the inverse of the spacing between the active plate and the strip surface. A plurality of the sensors 1 may be spaced across the width of the plate 7 for providing a profile of the strip flatness characteristics. The sensor finds particular application for monitoring and characterizing bottom buckles in steel strip following high temperature annealing.
