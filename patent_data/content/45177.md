# Airborne mowers.

## Abstract
An airborne mower includes a cutter 4 mounted be neath a deck 1 for rotation about a generally vertical axis, the cutter being disposed in an open bottomed cutting chamber 2 . An impeller 3 produces a generally downward flow of pressurised air around the outside of the cutting chamber 2 and a proportion of this air flows into the chamber around the bottom bounding edge of the chamber. Air flows out of the cutting chamber 2 through an exit opening 11 communicat ing with a discharge chute 10 so that grass cuttings are dis charged into the chute 10 without interfering with the flow of lift air.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An airborne mower comprising a cutter mounted beneath a deck for rotation about a generally ver tical axis, and means for producing a first flow of pressurised air to lift the deck off the ground while the cutter is cutting, characterised in that the mower further comprises means for producing a second flow of air to carry the grass cuttings through an opening in the deck, and means for separating the first and second air flows such that the grass cuttings are carried through the said opening without interference from the first air flow. 2. A mower according to claim 1 in which the second air flow is derived from the first air flow. 3. A mower according to claim 2 in which the separating means includes an open bottomed cutting chamber located beneath the deck, the cutter being rotatable within the chamber and the first air flow being a generallly downward flow of pressurised air aroundSthe outside of the chamber. 4. A mower according to claim 3 in which the said opening in the deck communicates with an opening in the cutting chamber, the arrangement being such that, in use, a proportion of the downwardly directed flow of pressurised air subsequently flows radially inwardly and upwardly into the cutting chamber and is discharged through the said openings along with the grass cuttings. 5. A mower according to claim 4 in which the deck comprises a generally dome shaped structure, the cutting chamber nesting within the dome shaped structure and being axially spaced therefrom. 6. A mower according to claim 5 in which an impeller is disposed in the space between the outer dome shaped deck and the inner cutting chamber. 7. A mower according to claim 6 in which a radially inward component of velocity is imparted to the downward flow of air to assist the flow of air into the cutting chamber beneath the bottom bounding edge of the cutting chamber when the mower is clear of the ground. 8. A mower according to claim 7 in which the radially inward component of velocity is imparted by appropriately shaping at least one of the walls confining the downward flow of air.

## Description
AIRBORNE MOWERS A linown disadvantage of most airborne mowers is that the grass cuttings are left behind on the ground.This is not only unsightly but can even encourage the growth of weeds. The problem has been to provide a flow of air whic h will carry grass cuttings into a grass collection device but without substantially reducing the pressure of the air cushion on which the mower rides. Some Åattempts have been made to overcome this problem, but so farnone have been entirely successful. In accordance with the present invention there is provided an airborne mower comprising a. cutter mounted beneath a deck for rotation about a generally vertical axis, means for producing a first flow of pressurised air to lift the deck off the ground while the cutter is cutting, means for producing a second flow of air to carry the grass cuttings into a discharge chute,. and means for separating the first and second flows of air such that the grass cuttings are discharged into the chute without inter erence with the first flow of air. Preferably the second flow of air is derived from the first flow of air. In particular, the cutter may be rotatable within an open bottomed cutting chamber located beneath the deck, and the first air flow producing means may comprise an impeller disposed beneath the deck but outside the chamber for generating a generaIly downward flow of pressurised air around the outside of the chamber to lift the mower off the ground.The discharge chute may then communicate with an exit opening disposed in the cutting chamber, the arrangement being such that, in use, a proportion of the downwardly directed flow of pressurised air subsequently flows radially inwardly and upwardly into the cutting chamber and is discharged through the exit opening along with the grass cuttings. Preferably the cutting chamber is an inner generally dome shaped chamber nesting within a similar outer cham oer, the two chambers being axially spaced apart and the impeller being disposed above the inner chamber in the space between the te chambers. The pressurised air then flows downwardly between the two chambers and is dramm ra dially into the inner chamber under the bottom bounding edge of the inner chamber when the mower is lifted off the ground. During its downward flow between the walls of the chambers a radially inward component of velocity is preferably imparted to the flow of air which assists the flow into the cutting chamber as it emerges from between the two walls. This component can be imparted, for example, by appropriately shaping at least one of the walls confining the downward flow of air. By way of example only, an embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which the sole figure is a partly sectioned general assembly drawing of an airborne mower embodying the invention. Referring to this figure, the illustrated mower consists of an electric motor 5 driving an impeller 3 and a cutter blade 4. Any other suitable cutting element can be substituted for the blade 4 , and the drive may be from a petrol motor rather than from an electric motor. The impeller 3 is disposed between an inner chamber 2.and an outer chamber 1, both chambers being generally domeshaped. The cutter blade4 is disposed within the inner chamber. 2. The motor 5 is protected by a hood 6, and an upper air inlet 8 is provided for cooling air to the motor. The air required to lift the mower is drawn in through the low er inlet 9, T he air flows in the direction shown by the arrows and the cooling air which is drawn through the inlet 8 combines with the. a4.r drawn through the inlet, 9 as it passes through a central opening in the roof of the outer chamber 1.The impeller 3 then forces the air downwardly over the outside of the inner chamber 2, the air being confined between the tazo chambers 1 and 2 and producing a cushion of air bounding the inner chamber 2. This lifts the mower off the ground, and.air thus flows underneath the bottom edge. of the inner chamber. The resulting build up of pressure within the inner chamber is relieved through an exit opening 11 in the wall of the chamber, the opèning ll lying Åat the entrance of a discharge chute 10 which also passes through a corresponding opening 12 in the wall of the outer chamber 1. There is thus a continuous flow of air through the chamber 2, and the air emerges from the discharge chute 10 along with grass cuttings, produced by the cutter.blade. This discharging flow of air through the inner chamber is quite independent of the flow of air between the two chambers induced by the impeller so that the impeller continues to provide the necessary liSt air lshile grass cuttings are ejected through the discharge chute and into a grass collection device n6t shown . The bottom portion 7 of the side wall of the outer chamber 1 is curved inwardly through an angle of at least 30 preferably in the region of 450 and, in this particular example, it terminates in a knife edge with a flat bottom face lying substantially in a horizontal plane This imparts a radially inward component to the velocity of the air emerging from betwe, en the walls i and 2.
