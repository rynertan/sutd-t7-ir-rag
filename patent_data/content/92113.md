# Optical recording medium for use in an optical storage system and method for making such recording medium.

## Abstract
An optical data storage system employing a data modulated writing laser beam and a non erasing reading laser beam of predetermined wavelength along with an improved optical medium comprised of multiple layers whose optical characteristics and thicknesses are chosen in conjunction with the writing and reading laser beams to provide an anti reflection condition for unrecorded portions of the medium and a relatively high reflectivity for recorded portions of the optical medium. A preferred optical medium includes a highly reflective aluminium layer, a fluorinated hydrocarbon polymer spacer layer overlaying the reflective layer, a nucleation layer overlaying the spacer layer and also serving as a heat insulator therefor, and a gold absorb er layer overlaying the nucleation layer.
