# Servo mechanism for use in an hydrostatic transmission.

## Abstract
A servo mechanism includes a piston and cylinder unit 13 controlled by a valve 14 coupled in known manner by a linkage means 21 to a movable control element 20 to provide closed loop servo operation to position the piston and cylinder unit piston rod 12 according to the position of the movable element 20 . The movable element 20 is fast with an annular gear segment of an epicyclic gear mechan ism of which the sun gear 16 forms a main control input and the planet pinion carrier 18 forms an override input. The mechanism is of utility in an hydraulic transmission of the variable stroke pump fixed stroke motor type, the override input being actuable by a pump port pressure limit sensor 26 .
