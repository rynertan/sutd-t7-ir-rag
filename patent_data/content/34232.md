# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SLIP RINGS AND TO SLIP RINGS PRODUCED THEREBY

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a slip ring including the steps forming a body 2 of plastics material, forming a plurality of grooves 6 in a surface of the body, treating the grooved surface to allow a metal skin 7 e.g. copper. to be deposited thereon by an electro less plating process, electro less plating a layer of base metal 7 on the treated surface of the plastics material, including the grooves 6 formed in the plastics body, removing the plated material 8 from between adjacent grooves to define individual tracks of the slip ring and electro plating the plated material to overlay the grooves only with a layer 9 of a noble metal e.g. gold.
