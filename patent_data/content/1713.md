# Electric cables and compositions for use in them.

## Abstract
Waterproof filling medium, used in telecommunication cables with cellular insulation of polyethylene or polypropylene, is based on a mineral oil with or without a gelling agent such as microcrystalline wax and includes two non polar additives. The first is soluble and of low enough molecular weight to reduce significantly the osmotic pressure of the base, but does not diffuse into the insulation below 80 C and the second is polymeric and of high enough molecular weight to increase the resistance to flow to obtain the required non draining property. Filling of cells in the insulation is inhibited.
