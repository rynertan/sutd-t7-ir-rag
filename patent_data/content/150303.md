# Steering system.

## Abstract
A steering system is disclosed wherein elastic means and restraining means in the form of a damper 23 are arranged in a steering effort transmission system. The elas tic means allows elastic deformation in the transmission system and the restraining means restrains such elastic deformation in response to a rate of displacement of a steering wheel 21 or a vehicle speed of a vehicle.
