# Photographic elements containing ballasted compounds.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to compounds of the type comprising a ballasting group which renders said com pounds substantially fast to diffusion in hydrophilic colloid media and at least one photographically useful group which is chemically linked to said ballasting group, and to photo graphic elements containing at least one compound of the type referred to. The ballasting groups in the compounds according to the present invention are derived from mono or di esters or ethers of glycerol. The linkage between ballasting group and photographically useful group can be realized via acid chlorides which are derived from the above said glycerol derivatives.
