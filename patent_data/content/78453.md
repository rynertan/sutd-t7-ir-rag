# Mixer heads for polyolefin extruders.

## Abstract
An apparatus for the mixing of linear polyolefin mat erials having high viscosity in a single screw extruder em ploying a mixing head 22 having a plurality of alternate longitudinal mixing channels 30 and wiping barriers 34 , characterized by longitudinal radially stepped regions on the opened bevelled leading edge portions of the outer surfaces of said wiping barriers 3A to act as hydrodynamic wedges to the passage of polyolefin material passing be tween said surfaces and the inner walls of the extruder barrel and both said radially stepped, opened bevelled, leading edge portions of the outer surfaces of said wiping barriers 34 and the outer circumferential surfaces of full diameter of said mixer head 22 , supporting an outer coat ing of gall resistant material.
