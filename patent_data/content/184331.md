## Description
TITLE PSORALEN INACTIVATION OF HUMAN TUMOR LEUKEMIA VIRUS III TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for the rapid inactivation of Human Tumor Leukemia Virus HTLV III without substantial loss of antigenicity. BACKGROUND The use of psoralen and various derivatives thereof to inactivate viruses is well known in both the patent and nonpatent literature. The term inactivation as used herein denotes the modification of a virus to eliminate its infectivity. U.S. Patent 4,124,598 issued November 7. 1978 to Hearst et al. discloses various psoralen derivatives which are useful for inactivating viruses. Psoralen and its useful derivatives have the structure indicated by the formula below EMI1.1 Name R1 R2 R3 R4Psoralen H H H HTMP 4,5 ,8 tri CH3 CH3 methylpsoralen AMT 4 aminomethyl CH CH CH CH NH 4.5 .8 trimethyl 3 3 3 2 2 psoralen HMT 4 hydroxymethyl CH3 CH3 CH3 CHO OOH 4,5 .8 trimethyl psoralen MMT 4 methoxymethyl CH3 CH3 CH3 CH OCH 4,5 .8 trimethyl 3 3 2 3 psoralen Mu6ajo et al. disclose five psoralen derivatives and three other related furocoumarins which were shown to photoreact well with DNA, but poorly with RNA. Three DNA viruses pseudorabies, canine hepatitis virus and fowl pox virus were photoinactivated in the presence of nonderivatized psoralen.while three RNA viruses NewCastle disease virus.foot and mouth disease virus and Teschen disease virus were resistant to an even longer period of psoralen photoinactivation. The RNA viruses resisted up to 120 minutes of irradiation by a quartz lamp with 366 nm filter at a distance of 25 cm intensity not reported in the presence of 18.7 Bg ml of psoralen. tL. Musajo.G.

Hearst et al. were the first to publish successful photoinactivation of an RNA virus by psoralen derivatives. Vesicular stomatitis virus VSV was photoinactived with HMT, MMT or AMT. all of which were a thousand times more effective than TMP.Two DNA viruses herpes simplex and vaccinia were a thousand times more sensitive to photoinactivation by the new psoralen derivatives in comparison to the RNA virus VSV . Irradiation was performed at 0.7 mW cm2 of long wave UV light. At 20 30 Bg ml, HMT, MMT andAMT were equivalent with respect to light dose response tin the inactivation of VSV . At 2 3 ug ml AMT was superior to HMT and HMT in the photoinactivation of VSV. J. R.

Hanson et al. showed that on a molar basis,TMP was more effective within its solubility range of approximately 0 1 Bg ml than AMT in the photoinactivat ion of Western equine encephalitis virus WEE, anRNA virus and herpes simplex virus a DNA virus .The greater solubility of AMT, however, resulted in superior inactivation rates by AMT at higher psoralen derivative concentrations. For example, WEE virus underwent a 10 8 f old inactivation in approximately 5 minutes of irradiation at 1.9 mW cmê in the presence of 10 Bg ml AMT. C. V. Hanson, J. L. Riggs and E.H.

Redfield et al. demonstrated the photoinactivation of cell free and intracellular influenza and herpes simplex viruses by irradiation at 1.2 KW cm of long wave ultraviolet light in the presence of various concentrations of AMT and HMT. Herpes virus was photoinactivated 104 fold in 0.9 minutes with 10 Bg ml of either HMT or ANT. At lower concentrations of the psoralen derivatives, AMT was always more effective than an equal amount of HMT. At all psoralen concentrations. influenza virus was more rapidly inactivated with AMT than with equivalent amounts ofHMT.In the presence of 10 wg ml of AMT, cell free influenza virus was inactivated 106 fold in 1 minute.Intracellular influenza virus required 4 minutes for a 10 fold inactivation under these conditions.

Inactivation of viruses for use as vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents , in Medical Virology II Proceedings of the 1982 International Symposium onMedical Virology , edited by L. M. de la Maza and E.M. Peterson, Elsevier Biomedical, NY, 1983, pp. 45 79. The first published report of the existence of HTLV III in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS was by Barre Sinoussi et al. inScience. Volume 220, p. 868 1983 . Soon after, Gallo and co workers at theUnited States National Institutes of Health published an article describing HTLV III. Popovic et al..Science, Volume 224, p. 497 1984 Recipients of blood transfusions and blood products. e.g.. Factor VIII, are among those in the high risk group for contacting AIDS. Consequently.there is a need for serodiagnostic methods for HTLVIII and or anti HTLV III antibodies, which methods can be used to screen blood and blood products. A contemplated method comprises a solid phase immunoassay in which purified HTLV III viral antigens are immobilized onto a solid phase. Sera from blood donors are contacted with the solid phase having HTLV III immobilized thereon. Anti HTLV III antibodies in the sera will bind to the viral antigens on the solid phase. After suitable incubation and washing, the solid phase having immune complex thereon is contacted with a labeled anti human antibody. The worldwide testing of blood is anticipated to exceed 100 million tests per year. The commercial production of serodiagnostic test kits requires the production of purified HTLV III. AIDS is known to have a 40 60t mortality rate. To protect not only workers engaged in the production and purification of large volumes of HTLV III containing fluid greater than 200 liters per week used in the manufacture of test kits. but also clinicians using the kits in laboratories, as well as to prevent contamination of the general population during commercial shipment of the kits, the use of inactivated HTLV III is required.However the inactivated virus must still be able to react with anti HTLV III antibodies. Although various inactivation methods are known, e.g., detergent disruption of virion morphology, heat inactivation of viral enzymes and disruption of viral caps it by dehydration, none specifically inactivates HTLV III nucleic acid. Such nucleic acid inactivation would add an increased margin of safety to inactivated HTLV III products. In addition, it would be desirable to inactivate HTLV III after propa ration, but prior to extensive purification, thereby minimizing the risk of accidental infection of personnel engaged in the purification of HTLV III. The use of detergents, heat. dehydrating agents, etc. prior to the purification of HTLV III from tissue culture host cells must be avoided since purification methods require intact virion morphology substantially unaltered nucleocapsid, capsid and viral envelope .Consequently. there is a need for a method for the rapid inactivation of HTLV III at the nucleic acid level which will not substantially alter the antigenicity or morphology of the virus. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION This need is met by the present invention which is a method for the rapid inactivation of HumanTumor Leukemia Virus III without substantial loss of antigenicity, comprising contacting the virus with a compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are either all H or all and R4 is halogenated lower alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl. lower alkoxy, lower alkyl or primary amino lower alkyl and simultaneously or sequentially exposing the resulting mixture to light having a wavelength in the range of 320 to 380 nm. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The literature cited above discloses the ability of psoralen and various derivates thereof to inactivate viruses without altering antigenicity.However, the rates at which these inactivators work vary greatly, depending on the particular psoralen derivative used and on the virus to be inactivated.The literature cited above shows that, in general, the so called retroviruses, i.e.. those containing a substantially single stranded RNA and reverse transcrip taste, are inactivated more slowly than other single stranded RNA viruses. e.g., influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus. The rates at which most retroviruses are inactivated. e.g., typically fifteen to thirty minutes.are too slow for the commercial scale production of inactivated HTLV III. i.e., one to two hundred liters of tissue culture fluid per week to be inactivated. It has been discovered that HTLV III, a typical retrovirus. can be inactivated using psoralen and selected derivatives thereof in the presence of long wave ultraviolet light at a rate five to ten times faster than the rate at which the typical retrovirus is inactivated. Although psoralen specific inactivation kinetics similar to those of the present invention have been reported for influenza and herpes simplex, the close morphological similarity betweenHTLV III and other retroviruses, notably Rous Sarcoma virus. suggests that the inactivation kinetics of HTLV III would be considerably slower than those actually discovered in the course of developing the present invention. Psoralen and its derivatives are described inU.S. 4,124,598 issued to Hearst et al. and are available from commercial sources. The HMT and AMT psoralen derivatives are preferred over TMP because they have been shown to provide slightly faster inactivation kinetics. Typical final concentrations are from 0.5 to 50 g ml. HTLV III is generally present in crude, unconcentrated tissue culture fluid at concentration ranging from 1 x 10 virions mL to 1x101 virions mL and can be inactivated conveniently using the method of the present invention. Either simultaneously or sequentially, the psoralen treated HTLV III is irradiated with long wave ultraviolet light in the range of 320 to 380 nm, preferably 350 to 366 nm, at an incident intensity of 1 mW cm2 to 200 mW cm2.The duration of the irradiation is determined empirically using inactivation curves which show surviving virus as a function of treatment time. Inactivation can be performed at any convenient temperature, although temperatures in the range of 0 to 500C are preferred, 40 to 10 C being most preferred. Because the ultraviolet radiation can heat the reaction mixture, thereby degrading viral antigens, lower temperatures are preferred. A temperature of 40C is most preferred. The present invention has its greatest utility in the preparation of commercial quantities large volumes of inactivated HTLV III. The preferred commercial method is in the nature of a semi continuous batch process. Typically, tissue culture fluid containing virus is placed in a vessel with psoralen or a suitable derivative thereof e.g.,ANT, HMT, TMP . The resulting mixture is then made to flow through optically transparent tubing, a portion of which is located in an ultraviolet irradiation zone. The path length of the tubing within the zone and the flow rate through the tubing can be adjusted to provide for the optimum irradiation exposure. The use of tubing in the shape of a coil permits optimization of irradiation exposure by adjustment of the coil pitch. Additionally, a light source can be placed inside the coil, as well as outside.Preferred optically transparent, i.e., long wave U.V. transparent, tubing includes borosilicate glass and plastics such as polystyrene, polypropylene and Mylar E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. . The coiled tubing can be placed in a container in which water at a controlled temperature is circulating. The water acts to prevent the ultraviolet light from heating the virus. The use of a cobalt salt in the water acts to enhance heat dissipation and also acts to transmit preferentially ultraviolet light in the preferred range. To maximize biological safety, it is preferred to place the entire apparatus under a biosafety hood. The following example illustrates the unexpected rapidity with which the method provided by the present invention is able to inactivate HTLV III. Example Initial experiments using psoralen as a method of inactivating HTLV III virus were designed to answer four fundamental questions which were 1 ability of psoralen to inactivate HTLV III 2 most effective concentration of psoralen 3 most effective light intensity at approximately 360 nm measured in mW cm2 and 4 treatment time duration of sample psoralen HTLV III solution irradiation . The previously published work of Swanstrom et al. 1981 was used as a guide for choosing the parameters of psoralen concentration light intensity and time of irradiation. This was the only known, published description of psoralen inactivation of a retrovirus, namely. Rous sarcoma virus RSV .In addition, this was the only publication which described inactivation kinetics change in viral infectivity versus time for psoralen inactivation of a retrovirus or RNA tumor virus. Swanstrom et al. showed that approximately 1 x 105 FFU ml fluorescent focus units mL of RSV was inactivated following a 30 min U.V. light exposure approximately 2 mW cm2 at a psoralen concentration of 25 eg mL. Based on these data an experiment was designed to answer the questions of HTLV III sensitivity to psoralen. effective concentration of psoralen. effective light intensity and range of exposure times. Choice of exposure times was very important for several reasons. First, infectivity assays for HTLV III are very time consuming and labor intensive, and each assay requires up to 30 days to reach an end point. HTLV III infectivity assays were performed by adding aliquots of serially diluted.treated virus suspensions to uninfected host cells H9 cells obtained from R. C. Gallo and at various times e.g.. 14, 21. 28 and 35 days removing cells at each dilution and analyzing for the presence of HTLV III antigens on the cell surface using an indirect immunofluorescent assay. HTLV III infected H9 cells showed a characteristic greenish fluorescence on their periphery using fluorescent microscopy. The end point chosen was the last dilution of HTLV III showing virus specific fluorescent cell staining. The virus titer or number of infectious virus particles originally present in the undiluted samples was calculated using the reciprocal of the end point.Second. once the relative sensitivity of HTLV III to psoralen had been established. additional experiments were necessary using numerous treatment times from zero to that time which gave 100 inactivation in order to establish inactivation kinetics curves or kill curves. Once the kill curve slope had been established, one can extend the treatment time beyond that which is known to give 100 inactivation and thereby establish confidence of inactivation or degree of overkill.Since HTLV III infection in humans may have 100t mortality, the objective using psoralen was to treat with U.V. light long enough to insure that the probability of having one infectious HTLV III virion was less than 1 x 106 to 1 x 1010 in one milliliter.Third, psoralen inactivation of HTLV III in large volumes of clarified tissue culture fluid 50 100 liters batch was investigated. If this could be accomplished. an enhanced margin of safety to manufacturing personnel engaged in HTLV III purification could be provided. In addition, psoralen inactivation in combination with other methods used to prepareHTLV III specific antigens e.g., detergent solubilization, alcohol treatment and drying, would provide absolute assurance of HTLV III inactivation or absence of infectivity. Experiments were performed using a startingHTLV III titer of 1 x 10 5FFU mL. Aliquots of virus were treated as follows 0, 10, or 20 vg mL psoralen, each at 5 mW cm2 0, 10, and 20pg mL psoralen. each at 25 mW cm2 and 0, 10, and 20 Bg mL psoralen, no irradiation. Times for low U.V. exposure 5 mW cm for each sample were 0, 15. 30, 45 and 90 mins and for 2 high U.V. exposure 25 mW cm were 0. 1, 2.5, 5. 10, 15, and 30 min. Based on the previous data of Swanstrom et al. 1981 these experimental conditions were predicted to produce varying degrees of HTLV III inactivation. Surprisingly. no infectious HTLV III was recovered from any sample which received any combination of psoralen and irradiation.HTLV III titers in samples receiving only psoralen and no irradiation, only irradiation and no psoralen and neither psoralen nor irradiation were identical i.e., 1 x 105 FFU mL. These data indicated that inactivation of HTLV III using psoralen was unexpectedly rapid compared to the published psoralen inactivation ofRous sarcoma virus and the unpublished results ofHanson. Additional experiments were designed which were essentially identical to those described above 2 with the primary changes as follows low U.V. 5mW cm samples were irradiated for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 minutes and high U.V. 25mW cm2 samples were irradiated for 0. 10. 20. 40, 90, 18, and 360 seconds. Purified, high titer HTLV III 1 x 10 FFU mL was employed in order to increase the chance of recovering infectious virus from treated samples. Figure 1 summarizes the results of these experiments for lowU.V. treated HTLV III samples in the presence of l0ug mL psoralen. Figure 2 summarizes the results for high U.V. treated HTLV III samples in the presence of 10 g mL psoralen. In summary, the data indicate that 1 x 10 FFU HTLV III can be inactivated using psoralen 10 g mL and high U.V. 25mW cm in 90 seconds and at low U.V. 5mW cm2 in 3 min. Assuming that HTLV III is a typical retrovirus all known information suggests this to be the case , the psoralen inactivation kinetics are surprising and unexpected compared with what one would expect based on the published psoralen inactivation of Rous sarcoma virus. The rapidity of the inactivation makes the method of the present invention suitable for inactivation of large volumes of clarified tissue culture fluid using a semi continuous batch process as described earlier.
