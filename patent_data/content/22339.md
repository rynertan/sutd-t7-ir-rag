# Water soluble pressure sensitive adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
A water soluble pressure sensitive adhesive composition is described containing a polymerization product obtained by the solution polymerization of a water soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the presence of an alcoholic plasticizer having a molecular weight of less than about 3,000 and which is a liquid at room temperature, selected from the group consisting of polyether polyols and polyhydric alcohols, wherein the polymerization product contains as a polymer component at least an addition copolymer of the water soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer and the alcoholic plasticizer.
