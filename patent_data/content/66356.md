# Process for the production of fine amorphous metallic wires.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a fine amorphous metallic wire is described, comprising melt spinning an iron family element base alloy having an amorphous substance forming ability to obtain a fine amorphous metallic wire, and passing the thus formed fine amorphous metallic wire through a die so as to draw within an area reduction percentage range of from about 5 to about 90 . The thus produced fine amorphous metallic wire of the iron family element base system is excellent in heat resistance, corrosion resistance, electromagnetic characteristics, and has excellent mechanical properties, such as breaking strength and a degree of drawing at break. Thus, it is very useful for various industrial materials such as electric and electronic parts, composite materials, and fibrous materials.
