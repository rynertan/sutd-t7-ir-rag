# METHOD OF BENDING PLATE MATERIALS

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of bending a plate material by means of an exclusive use die shoe for the plate material to be worked and a versatile bending means having a pressing surface, wherein the edge portion of the die shoe 10 serves as a bending surface 11 for the plate material 5 the plate material 5 is mounted on and secured to the die shoe 10 , bending means 15, 16, and 17 18 are brought into contact with and pressed against a portion of the surface to be bent 13 of the plate material 5 , moving the same along the surface to be bent, and bending the surface to be bent step by step. The bending means 15, 16, and 17 comprise a plurality of bending members, each bending member being formed in such a manner that the angle of each of the pressing surfaces 19, 20, and 21 thereof is formed such as to become gradually larger, and the bending members are used in sequence starting with the one having the pressing surface with the smallest angle. Or, the bending means 18 is a bending member having a pressing surface parallel to the axis of the bending member and is inclined against the plate material step by step.
