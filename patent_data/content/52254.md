# Preparation of organic isocyanates.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for the prepara tion of an organic isocyanate product comprising the step of preparing a heated solution of an alkyl carbamate in a solvent whereby the carbamate is catalytically decomposed into the corresponding organic isocyanate product and alkyl alcohol. The solvent is an N,N dialkyl aniline compound which is catalytic with respect to the decomposition rate of the carbamate but unreactive with respect to the organic isocyanate product. Organic isocyanates are useful chemical intermediates that may be reacted, for example, with polyols to produce polyurethanes.
