## Description
Chlorthalidone is a well known diuretic agent which has been widely marketed since the early 1960 s. Chlorthalidone, however, has limited aqueous solubility 120 Mg ml and accordingly is not well absorbed from the human gastrointestinal tract. The high melting point of chlorthalidone 2250C suggests that chlorthalidone crystals have a very high lattice energy which may hinder dissolution and thereby decrease absorption from gastrointestinal fluids. A need exists, therefore, for finding methods for increasing the dissolution of chlorthalidone and thereby increasing bioavailability.It is known that significant improvement in the dissolution and bioavailability of various pharmaceutical active ingredients having poor solubility can be achieved using solid state dispersion techniques as described in general by W.L. Chiou et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 60, 1281 1971 andS. Riegelman et al., US Patent No. 4,151,273. As defined in the Chiou article, the term solid state dispersion means a dispersion of one or more active ingredients in an inert carrier or matrix at solid state prepared by the melting fusion , solvent, or melting solvent method .The dispersion of an active ingredient in a solid carrier or diluent by traditional mechanical mixing is not included within the definition of the term. Solid state dispersions may also be called solid dispersions. solid solutions, or coprecipitates, the last term being used frequently to refer to solid state dispersions obtained by the solvent method.Solid state dispersions of chlorthalidone in urea, prepared by the fusion method, have been reported by D. Bloch et al., Pharm. Acta. Helv., 57, 231 1982 as shoring enhanced dissolution characteristics.In the solvent method for preparing solid state dispersions, the active ingredient is conventionally dispersed in a water soluble carrier by dissolving a physical mixture containing the active ingredient and the carrier in a common organic solvent and then removing the solvent by evaporation.The resulting solid dispersion is recovered and used in the preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations using conventional methods.Various water soluble carriers are known in the art to be useful for preparing solid state dispersions containing pharmaceutical agents using the solvent method. Examples of such carriers include water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP and polyethylene glycol PEG . Many organic solvents are useful in the solvent method for preparing solid state dispersions. Preferably, the solvent should be a capable of dissolving both the active ingredient and the carrier, b chemically inert with respect to the active ingredient and the carrier, and c be sufficiently volatile to permit facile removal by evaporation using conventional techniques.Alkanols having from one to four carbon atoms would in general be expected to be useful for preparing solid state dispersions by the solvent method. However, it is known in the art that the lower alkanols, in particular methanol and ethanol, are capable of reacting with chlorthalidone to form alkyl ethers according to the reaction depicted below whereR is C1 C4 alkyl EMI3.1 The above reaction is described in the literature by W. Graf et al., Helv. Chim. Acta., 42, 1085 1959 and M. Auterhoff et al., Arch. Pharm., 312, 876 1979 .In view of the reactivity of the lower alkanols to chlorthalidone, one skilled in the art would not have been motivated to employ the lower alkanols, in particular methanol and ethanol, as a solvent in the solvent method for preparing water soluble solid state dispersions of chlorthalidone, especially since commercial samples of chlorthalidone may contain acetic acid as an impurity.The present invention provides a method for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble solid state dispersions of chlorthalidone by the solvent method using a C1 C4 alkanol, in particular methanol or ethanol, without the substantial formation of alkyl ethers as degradation products. In particular, the present invention comprehends a process for preparing a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone which comprises a forming a solution comprising a water soluble pharma ceutically acceptable polymeric carrier and a C1 C4 alkanol, b dissolving chlorthalidone in the solution thus formed, and c removing the C1 C4 alkanol from the solution by evaporation, the amount of said carrier being effective to suppress substantially the formation of the alkyl ether by product from the reaction of chlorthalidone with the C1 C4 alkanol.Solid state dispersions of chlorthalidone prepared by using methanol as the common solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP as the water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable carrier one part by weight of PVP to two parts by weight of chlorthalidone when administered to humans as 25 mg tablets were shown to provide significantly higher blood levels, faster peak levels, and greater areas under the curve AgCs as compared to commercially available Hygrot Tablets.The polymeric carrier used in the process of the invention must be pharmaceutically acceptable and be substantially soluble both in water and in the particular C1 C4 alkanol selected for use in the process. Moreover, the polymeric carrier must be capable of forming a solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone after removal of the alkanol, and be capable of suppressing ether formation arising from reaction of the chlorthalidone with the C1 C4 alkanol, as discussed above. The ability of a polymeric carrier to suppress ether formation can be determined routinely by dissolving chlorthalidone in a C1 C4 alkanol, such as methanol, in a glass container in the presence and absence of the polymeric carrier and analyzing aliquots of the solution taken at varying times up to 24 hours for chlorthalidone content byHPLC techniques.An acceptable loss of chlorthalidone is up to about 2 after 24 hours at 400C.A preferred polymeric carrier is polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP , the general use of which to prepare solid state dispersions of pharmaceutical active ingredients is described by theChiou reference, supra. As previously discussed herein, the literature suggests that the reaction of chlorthalidone and methanol to form ether by products is catalyzed by strong acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. Evidence has now been obtained which demonstrates that the reaction between chlorthalidone and methanol is also catalyzed by trace amounts of heavy metal ions, such as iron or nickel ions, which may be present as trace impurities in commercially available chlorthalidone or may be present from the use of processing equipment fabricated from iron or ferro alloys such as stainless steel.Although it has now been found that acetic acid, which may be present in commercially available samples of chlorthalidone, does not itself catalyze the reaction forming ether by products, evidence suggests that acetic acid can enhance the catalytic effect of heavy metal ions on ether formation. It is believed that PVP suppresses the formation of ethers primarily by complexing trace amounts of heavy metal ions thus making them unavailable for catalysis. The suppresssion of ether formation may to a lesser extent also be attributed to a protective effect arising from formation of a chemical complex between chlorthalidone and PVP or to a medium effect at high PVP concentrations.The amount of polymeric carrier employed in the process of the invention must be sufficient to suppress substantially the formation of ether by products when chlorthalidone is mixed with the C1 C4 alkanol and to provide a water soluble solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone after removal of the alkanol.Using methanol, the amount of PVP employed in the process of the invention must be at least 20 by weight one part of PVP to four parts of chlorthalidone of the total combined weight of the chlorthalidone and PVP. A range of about 20CC to about 99 one part chlorthalidone to 100 parts of PVP by weight of PVP of the total combined weight of PVP and chlorthalidone can be employed. A range of from about 20 to about 665ó one part of PVP to 0.5 parts of chlorthalidone by weight of PVP is preferred. Using glass lined equipment, the optimum weight of PVP is about 25ra by weight one part of PVP to three parts of chlorthalidone .Using stainless steel equipment, it is necessary to use more PVP for optimum results, and about 3D,0 by weight of PVP one part of PVP to two parts of chlorthalidone is most preferred.The amount of the C1 C4 alkanol employed in the process of the invention should be sufficient to solubilize both the polymeric carrier and chlorthalidone. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that best results will be achieved on a large scale using as high a concentration of chlorthalidone as is possible. Thus, optimally the process should be carried out using concentrations of chlorthalidone at the upper linits of solubility. The apparent equilibrium solubility of chlorthalidone at 260C in various alkanols is as follows methanol 76.1 mg ml ethanol 15,5 mg ml isopropanol 3.2 mg ml.In order to completely solubilize the chlorthalidone in the solution of the polymeric carrier in the appropriate C1 C4 alkanol, it may be necessary to heat the initial mixture. For example, using methanol, the mixture formed by adding chlorthalidone to the solution of the polymeric carrier in the C1 C4 alkanol in particular PVP in methanol can be heated at a temperature ranging from about 55 58 0C to effect complete solution. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that PVP itself can increase the solubility of chlorthalidone in the C1 C4 alkanol. The order of addition of chlorthalidone and the polymeric carrier is critical to suppress ether formation. It is essential that the polymeric carrier is dissolved in theC1 C4 alkanol to form a solution before chlorthalidone comes in contact with the alkanol. If a physical mixture of chlorthalidone and the polymeric carrier is added to theC1 C4 alkanol as described b Chiou, supra , ether formation is not adequately suppressed.Likewise, if chlorthalidone is first dissolved in the C1 C4 alkanol to form a solution, and the polymeric carrier is then added, ether formation is not adequately suppressed. rilhen the chlorthalidone is added to a solution of the polymeric carrier in the C1 C4 alkanol, ether formation is substantially suppressed, and the solid state dispersion after evaporation of the C1 C4 alkanol will not contain substantial amounts of undesirable ether by products.Once the chlorthalidone is added to the solution comprising the polymeric carrier and the C1 C4 alkanol, the solution will be stable to ether formation for at least one hour with continued heating and for at least four days at room temperature. During normal processing using methanol and PVP, the temperature will only need to be held at 55 0C for about ten minutes to allow complete solution of chlorthalidone.The C1 C4 alkanols used in the process of the present invention are saturated organic mono alcohols having from one to four carbon atoms, i.e., methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, isobutanol, or tertbutanol. Ieiethanol and ethanol are preferred. Methanol is most preferred because it is capable of dissolving chlorthalidone at higher concentrations.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the process of the present invention can be carried out in the presence of a chelating agent, for example, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid EDTA , which can complex and further reduce the amount of trace heavy metals present in solution. When EDTA is used with methanol as the solvent, water at least 555 must also be included in the solution to solubilize theEDTA. This, however, lowers the solubility of chlorthalidone thereby increasing the amount of methanol required. By using a chelating agent in combination with the polymeric carrier, the amount of the polymeric carrier can be reduced. The selection and use of a particular chelating agent will be apparent to those skilled in the art.Recovery of the solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone from the solution formed by dissolving chlorthalidone in a solution of the polymeric carrier in the C 4 alkanol can be carried out using procedures conventional in the art for evaporating solvents. The dried water soluble solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone can be used directly as a diuretic or, if desired, it can be incorporated into conventional pharmaceutical solid dosage forms, such as tablets or capsules, using conventional pharmaceutical procedures or techniques.In a preferred method for recovering the solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone in PVP from methanol, the methanol solution containing chlorthalidone and PVP is spray coated onto lactose or other suitable excipient using a fluid bed granulator by conventional techniques to give a free flowing powder in which the lactose particles are surrounded by a coating of the solid state dispersion. The resulting solid state dispersion can be incorporated into conventional solid pharmaceutical formulations e.g. tablets or capsules using methods known in the pharmaceutical art. Then a fluid bed granulator is used to remove methanol from solutions containing chlorthalidone and PVP, the product temperature employed during processing may influence both the ether content and the methanol content of the final product.Best results are obtained using a combination of spray rate and inlet air temperature to maintain the product temperature between 45 and 550C.If desired, residual methanol can be removed by spraying water onto the lactose coated product in the fluid bed granulator. Best results are obtained using a combination of spray rate and inlet air temperature to maintain a product temperature between 28 and 320C. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for employing the solid state dispersions of chlorthalidone prepared as hereindescribed will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The compositions can be preferably tablets or capsules and can contain other conventional inert carriers or excipients such as lubricants, disintegrating agents, fillers, coatings etc..For tablets containing a solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone in PVP, coated onto lactose particles, preferred excipients are microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate. Preferably, the amount of chlorthalidone in a tablet can range from about 5 mg to about 25 mg. A compressed tablet containing 25 mg of chlorthalidone is presently being marketed. The usual daily dosage of chlorthalidone is 0.2 to 1.3 mg kg.The present invention also contemplates a method for inducing diuresis in a warm blooded animal, including humans, which comprised administering to said animal a solid state dispersion of chlorthalidone prepared by the process of this invention as herein described in an amount sufficient to induce diuresis. In a preferred method, the solid state dispersion employs PVP as the dispersing agent, and the dispersion is spray coated onto lactose particles. It is preferred to use the solid state dispersion, or the solid state dispersion spray coated onto lactose, in a compressed tablet containing other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.The following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments hereinafter described Example 1A.
