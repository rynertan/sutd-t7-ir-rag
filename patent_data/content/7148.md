# Method of and apparatus for increasing the fin density of heat exchanger sheet material.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus 40 and method for increasing the fin density of a serpentine sheet 10 having a plurality of fins 14a, 14b, 14c , each fin having two sides 16, 18 coupled together at one end 20 with a space 22 between the sides. Blocks 30,32 having recesses 30a, 32a for receiv ing the end 20, 24 of one side 16 of a fin 14a are moved vertically from opposite sides A,B of the sheet 10 into contact with such ends. Simultaneously, blades 34, 36 are moved vertically into positions at the other side 18 of the fin 14a from opposite sides A, B of the sheet. Then, the blades 34, 36 are moved transversely towards the blocks 30, 32 , which are now held stationary, to compress the fin 14a a predetermined amount by moving the other fin side towards the one fin side. The blocks and blades are then withdrawn from the sheet to move another fin 14b into position for another compressing operation.
