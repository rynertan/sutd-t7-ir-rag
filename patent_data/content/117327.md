Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the aforementioned dianhydrides with any of the aforementioned diamino compounds while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200C to 400OC. and preferably 230 to 3000C. can be employed.Any order of addition of chain stoppers ordinarily employed in melt polymerization can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 two 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups.Generally, useful polyetherimides have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 250C. Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.Heath et al. 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al. 3,850,885, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. The polyetherimides may also be prepared by the reaction of a bis nitrophthalimide and an alkali metal salt of an organic compound, a dihydric phenol and an alkali phenoxide, or the reaction of an aryloxysubstituted bisphthalimide, as disclosed in U.S.Patents Nos. 3,88.7,588 to Cook et al. 4,017,511 toWilliams and 4,024,110 to Takekoshi, incorporated herein by reference. The polyarylates used in the blends of the subject invention can be made by a variety of methods.For example, an interfacial polycondensation can be used in which an aqueous alkaline solution a pH above about 7 to about 13 of a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalide mixture dissolved in a water immiscible organic solvent are mixed and reacted. Typical interfacial polycondensation procedures are disclosed, for example, in W.M.Eareckson, J. Polymer Sci., XL 399 1959 . According to a typical polycondensation procedure, an aqueous alkaline solution of dihydric phenol is added to the dihalide mixture, dissolved in an organic solvent, or an organic solvent solution of the dihalide mixture is added to an aqueous alkaline solution of diphenol and the system then is polymerized. Alternatively, an aqueous alkaline solution of the dihydric phenol and a water immiscible organic solvent solution of the dihalide mixture can be simultaneously fed into a reaction vessel, Interfacial polycondensation takes place near the interface of the aqueous phase and the organic phase. However, since the aqueous phase and the organic phase are essentially immiscible, it is necessary to mutually disperse the phases with, for example, an agitator or a mixer such as a homomixer. The cdncentration of the dihalide mixture dissolved in the organic solvent is usually about 2 to about 25 by weight, preferably 3 to 15 by weight.The concentration of the dihydric phenol in the aqueous alkaline solution is also usually about 2 to about 25 by weight, preferably 3 to 15 by weight. The amounts of diphenol and the terephthaloyl dihalide mixture are such that the molar ratio between them is preferably maintained equivalent. An excess of the dihalide mixture is generally not desirable in the preparation of high molecular weight e.g., about 1 x 104 aromatic qopolyesters. Preferred alkalis are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The concentration of the alkali in the aqueous solution can vary considerably depending upon the reaction conditions, but usually ranges from about 0.5 to about 10g by weight. Advantageously, the quantity of the alkali is nearly equivalent to the hydroxy groups of the diphenol used or the alkali is present in a slight excess. I Hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons can be used as water immiscible organic solvents for the dihalide mixture. Examples of suitable organic solvents are methylene dichloride, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, benzene and methylbenzene. Especially preferred are those solvents which also dissolve the polyarylate produced.Methylene dichloride is the most preferred solvent. The reaction temperature may vary considerably but it is preferably below about 400C.Reaction temperatures of 50 to 300C. are especially preferred. The interfacial polymerization is usually performed at normal atmospheric pressure, and is completed in about 1 to 30 hours. A catalyst and a viscosity stabilizer are in general employed. Examples of catalysts which can be used include quaternary ammonium compounds, tertiary sulfonium compounds, quaternary phosphonium compounds, quaternary arsonium compounds, and tertiary amine compounds. Suitable viscosity stabilizers are, for example, monohydric phenols such as o phenyl phenol, p phenyl phenol, m cresol, p tert butyl phenol, 2phenyl 2 hydroxy phenylpropane and naphthol. The amount of catalyst used ranges from about 0.01 to about 1 mol based on the diphenol and the amount of viscosity stabilizer ranges from about 0.5 to about 5 mol based on the diphenol. Another useful method for forming polyarylates is by melt polymerization as disclosed, for example, in A. Conix,Ind. Eng. Chem., 51, 147 1959 , Japanese PatentPublication 15247 1963 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,395,119. Melt polymerization can be performed, for example, by reacting an aliphatic carboxylic acid diester of the dihydric phenol, e.g., as described above, with the aromatic polycarboxylic acid at an elevated temperature under reduced pressure. Melt polymerization can also be carried out by reacting the diphenol and a mixture of a diaryl ester of the acid while heating. A typical diaryl ester is the diphenyl ester. The reaction temperature employed is in the range of about isoa to about 3500C., preferably 180 to 320 C. The reaction pressure is usually varied in the course of the reaction from atmospheric pressure at the early stage of the reaction to reduced pressure, for example, below about 0.02 mmHg, toward the end of the reaction. The melt polymerization is completed, in general, in about 2 to about 8 hours. A number of catalysts can be used in the reaction and preferred catalysts include titanium compounds such as butyl ortho titanate and titanium dioxide. Other catalysts such as zinc oxide, lead oxide and diantimony trioxide can also be used. Still another method for forming polyarylates is solution polymerization in which the polyarylate is prepared by reacting the diphenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalide and in a water immiscible organic solvent. Useful solution polymerization procedures are disclosed, for example, in A. Conix, Ind. Eng. Chem., 51, 147 1959 , and U.S. Pat. No. 3,133,898. In solution polymerization, the dihydric phenol and the acid dihalide are usually mixed in equimolar proportions in a water immiscible organic solvent, and the mixture is gradually heated to high temperatures of, for example, about 220 C. Preferably, the solvent used is one which also dissolves the polyarylate formed, such as dichloroethylbenzene. Usually, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base to neutralize the hydrogen halide, for example, hydrogen chloride, formed. Suitable examples of the bases which can be used include a tertiary amine such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, etc., and pyrid ine. The polycarbonates of the subject blends can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as diphenyl carbonate or phosgene carbonyl chloride in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature and U.S. Pat Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed in U.S Pat. No. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. The polycarbonates utilized in the present invention also include the polymeric derivatives of a dihydric phenol, a dicarboxylic acid, and carbonic acid such aware disclosed in U.S. Pat.No. 3,169,131. It is also possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with hydroxy or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the aromatic polycarbonate utilized in the practice of this invention Also employed in the practice of the invention can be blends of any of the above materials to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. In addition, branched polycarbonates such as are described in U.S.Pat. No. 4,001,184, can also be utilized in the practice of this invention, as can blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. The aliphatic aromatic polyesters of the above formula can be obtained by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art including theEMI18.1 reaction of anyzaromatic dicarboxylic acid of theEMI18.2 formulaEMI18.3 where independently each R11 is an alkyl radical having from 1 10 or more carbon atoms, with any aliphatic diol of the formula HO R10 OK where R10 is as previously defined. As used herein and in the appended claims, the term polyesters include esters of the above formula prepared by esterifying or transesterifying terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or their low molecular weight esters, or mixtures thereof, plus other polyesters derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their alkyl esters and other aliphatic diols or polyols other than those set forth above, subject to the proviso that the polyesters contain at least about 95 by weight polyesters derived from the esterification or transesterification of dicarboxylic acid or esters and aliphatic diols of the above formulae. Among the many methods of making aliphaticaromatic polyesters which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, are those disclosed in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science andTechnology, Vol. II, entitled Polyesters , pages 62128, published by Interscience Publishers 1969 , as well as those disclosed in Wirth et al. U.S. Pat. Nos.3,787,364 and 3,838,097, and Wind et al. U.S. Pat.No. 2,465,319, Pengilly, U.S. Pat. No. 3,047,539, and the like. Illustratively, the esterification reactions advantageously can be carried out in an inert atmosphere in the presence of known esterification or transesterification catalysts at nominal react.ion temperatures with the simultaneous removal of water or alkanol as produced at elevated temperatures with subsequent further polycondensation at elevated temperatures under reduced pressure in the presence of known catalysts until polyesters of the desired viscosity are obtained. In accordance with the present invention, blends of a polyetherimide, a polyarylate, and a thermoplastic polymer selected from polycarbonates and aliphatic aromatic polyesters are generally obtainable in all proportions of the three polymers relative to each other. Thus, the polyetherimide and polyarylate components of the blend may be mixed in weight ratios of 1 99 to 99 1 relative to each other and such a range of mixtures may be combined with the thermoplastic component in weight ratios of 1 99 to 99 1. It may be generally desirable to include a minimum amount of, for example, about 5 , of each of the components to achieve the desired properties, for the blend.Consequently, blend comprising from about 5 to 85 , by weight, polyetherimide, from about 5 to about 85 , by weight, polyarylate, and the remainder the above mentioned thermoplastic polymer are preferred blends of the invention. By controlling the proportions of the components of the blend relative to each other, blends having certain predetermined useful properties which are improved over those of certain components alone may be readily obtained. In general, blends of the subject invention may exhibit, depending on the blend ratio. of the components, one or more of the properties of high flame resistance, good impact strength and high heat distortion temperature. It is contemplated that the blends of the present invention may also include other additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, flexbilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. It is also contemplated that the blends of the invention may include two or more polyetherimides with one or more polyarylates or two or more polyarylates in combination with one or more polyetherimides. Methods for forming blends of the present invention may vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular and filamentous form, extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermoplastic compositions. The subject ternary blends have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workoading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Film formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously. Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation application for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, coil and cable wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heatresistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures. Films made from the subject ternary blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc. and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and to effect curing of the resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blends include their use as binders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymer blends of the invention by incorporating such fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica, into the blends prior to molding. Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. The following examples illustrate specific ternary blends in accordance with the present invention.It should be understood that the examples are given for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention. In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I A polyetherimide polyarylate polycarbonate blend according to the invention was prepared, the blend then molded into test bars and the bars tested for various physical and chemical properties. The polyetherimide for the blend was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amount of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyll propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 250 to about 3000C. and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer was extruded at about 300 C. to form a strand and mechanically chopped into pellets. A test bar injection molded from the pellets was clear and had a heat distortion temperature of about 200 C.at 1 8.5 kg cm2 and a notched Izod impact strength ASTM 256 of about 53.4 J m.To mold the test bar at a temperature of 363 3720C., a pressure in excess of l4Okglcm2 was necessaryThe polyarylate was produced from the reaction of bisphenol A and a mixture of.

In addition, by appropriate selection of component ratios, blends can be formulated which have combinations of desirable properties such as high impact strength and flame resistance, e.g., the blends of Examples II and III, or high heat distortion and high flame resistance, e.g., the blend of Example IV. Substitution of other polyetherimides, polyarylates and or thermoplastic polymers for the components of the blends of the above examples may result in the formulation of polymer blends having improved characteristics such as impact strength, flame resistance and high heat distortion temperature over the polymer components above. While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
