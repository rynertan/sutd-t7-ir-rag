Hitherto, as fungicides used for protecting agricultural and horticultural plants from disease, organochlorine compounds, organosulfur compounds and gaseous compounds have been known and utilized. However, organochlorine compounds have the demerits of frequently being phytotoxic to crops and of frequently remaining in plant bodies and in soil due to their use in high concentrations because of their low effectiveness. Organosulfur compounds have the demerits of frequently being phytotoxic to crops and of causing contact dermatitis to a person handling them. In addition, gaseous compounds have the demerits of an irritating and unpleasant odor. As nematicides, there have been used so called fumigants. However, the fumigants have the demerits of frequently being phytotoxic to crops, of having an irritating or unpleasant odor and of not being applicable directly onto plants. The present inventors have found that the compounds represented by formula I below show a noticeable preventative effect in relation to crop diseases and nematodes, for instance Fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, scab, grey mold, rice blast, sheath blight of rice, brown spot of rice, Verticillium wilt, yellows, damping off, storage diseases of citrus, seed diseases, rice white tip nematode, chrysanthemum folia nematode, root knot nematodes, lesion nematodes, cyst nematodes, pine wood nematode, etc., without showing the disadvantages of the fungicides, bactericides and nematocides hitherto known and used.Moreover, quite unexpectedly they exhibit a noticeable preventative effect on diseases of crop plants, for instance powdery mildew, scab, grey mold, etc., when applied to the soil where the crop plants have been grown, without showing bad effects such as phytotoxicity to the crop plants.
