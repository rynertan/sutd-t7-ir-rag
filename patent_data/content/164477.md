## Description
POLYCARBONATES EXHIBITING IMPROVED HEAT RESISTANCE RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation in part application of copending application Ser. No.453,105, filed December 27, 1982. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polycarbonates are well known thermoplastic materials which due to their many advantageous properties find use as thermoplastic engineering materials in many commercial and industrial applications. The polycarbonates exhibit, for example, excellent properties of toughness, flexibility, optical clarity, and heat resistance.The polycarbonates are generally prepared by the coreaction of a dihydric phenol such as bisphenol A with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. While presently available conventional polycarbonates are quite useful in a wide range of applications there nevertheless exists a need, especially wn applications involving high temp erature environments, for polycarbonates exhibiting greater heat resistance than that possessed by conventional polycarbonates. It is, therefore, an object of the instant invention to provide polycarbonates which exhibit improved heat resistance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the instant invention there are provided polycarbonate resins which exhibit improved heat resistance. These polycarbonates are comprised of at least one repeating structural unit represented by the general fromulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 is independently selected from monovalent hydrocarbon radicals X represents a cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms and m is selected from whole numbers having a value of from 0 up to the number of replaceable hydrogen atoms present on X, inclusive. Also in accordance with the instant invention there are provided impact modified polycarbonates exhibiting improved heat resistance. These polycarbonates contain at least one recurring structural unit of the type described hereinafore and have admixed therewith an amount of at least one impact modifying compound effective to improve the impact properties thereof. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has been found that linear carbonate polymers can be obtained which exhibit improved heat resistance as compared to conventional polycarbonates. These novel polycarbonates are derived from i a carbonate precursor and ii at least one novel dihydric phenol represented by the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is independently selected from halogen radicals, monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals R1 is independently selected from monovalent hydrocarbon radicals X represents a cycloalkylidene radical containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms n is independently selected from whole numbers having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive and m is a whole lumber having a value of fromO up to the number of hydrogen atoms present onX available for replacement. The halogen radicals represented by R are preferably selected from chlorine and bromine. The monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R are selected from alkyl radicals, aryl radicals, aralkyl radicals, alkaryl radicals, and cycloalkyl radicals. The preferred alkyl radicals represented by R are those containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms. Some illustrative nonlimiting examples of these alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiarybutyl,pentyl, neopentyl, and the like.The preferred aryl radicals represented by R are those containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, i.e., phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl. The preferred aralkyl and alkaryl radicals represented by R are those containing from 7 to about 14 carbon atoms. Some illustrative non limiting examples of these alkaryl and aralkyl radicals include benzyl, tolyl, ethyl phenyl, and the like. The preferred cycloalkyl radicals represented by R are those containing from 4 to about 6 ring carbon atoms and include cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals represented by R are preferably selected from alkoxy and aryloxy radicals. The preferred alkoxy radicals are those containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms and include, for example, methoxy, butoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, and the like. The preferred aryloxy radical is phenoxy. Preferably R is independently selected from monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, with the alkyl radicals being the preferred hydrocarbon radicals. The monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R1 are selected from alkyl radicals, aryl radicals, alkaryl radicals, aralkyl radicals, and cycloalkyl radicals. The preferred alkyl radicals are those containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms.Some illustrative non limiting examples of these alkyl radicals include methyl ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, and the like. The preferred aryl radicals are those containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, i.e., phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl.

Some illustrative non limiting examples of these preferred aralkyl and alkaryl radicals include benzyl, tolyl, ethylphenyl, and the like. The preferred cycloalkyl radicals represented by R1 are those containing from 4 to 6 ring carbon atoms, i.e., cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The preferred monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R1 are the alkyl radicals. In the dihydric phenol compounds of Formula I if more than one R substituent is present on the aromatic nuclear residue they can be the same or different. Likewise, if more than one R1 substituent is present on the cycloalkylidene radical represented by X they may be the same or different. In Formula I m preferably represents a whole number having a value of from 0 to about 6. The cycloalkylidene radicals represented byX are the monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals which may be represented by the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1 and m are as defined hereinafore, andY represents an alkylene radical containing from 7 to about 15 carbon atoms which together with the C atom forms a monocyclic cycloalkylidene radical containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms.That is to say, Y represents the CH2 r radical wherein r is a positive integer having a value of from 7 to about 15. The term monocyclic as used herein with respect to the cycloalkylidene radicals is meant to specify that the cycloalkylidene radicals contain only one ring, i.e., they are non polycyclic. Thus, these non polycyclic cyclaolkylidene radicals do not include those cyclic groups which are not monocyclic, e.g., bicyclic, bridged or fused cyclic structures such as 2 norbornylidene, bicyclo 3.. O octylene, and decahydronaphthylene. Preferred polycarbonates, from the standpoint of exhibiting particularly improved heat resistance, are those containing at least one repeating structural unit represented by the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein R1 is independently selected from monovalent hydrocarbon radicals X represents a monocyclic cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms and m is selected from a whole number having a value of from 0 up to the number of replaceable hydrogen atoms present on X. These linear polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols of Formula I wherein n is zero andX represents amonocycliccyclaolkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms.i.e., those dihydric phenols having the general formulaEMI8.1 wherein R1 and m are as defined hereinafore, andX is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Preferred linear polycarbonates containing at least one recurring structural unit represented byFormula II are those wherein m in Formula II is zero.These polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols of Formula Ia wherein m is zero. Preferred polycarbonates containing at least one recurring structural unit of Formula II wherein m is zero are those containing at least one repeating structural unit represented by the general formula EMI9.1 wherein X represents a monocyclic cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. These linear polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols represented by the general formulaEMI9.2 wherein X is selected frommonocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Preferred linear polycarbonates of Formulae II and IIa are those wherein X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. These polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols of Formulae Ia and Ib, respectively, wherein X is selected from cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. More preferred linear polycarbonates containing at least one recurring structural unit of FormulaeII and IIa are those wherein X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. These more preferred polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols of Formulae Ia and Ib, respectively, whereinX is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Particularly useful linear polycarbonates containing at least one repeating structural unit represented by Formula II or by Formula Ila are those wherein X is selected from cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 12 to 14 ring carbon atoms.These polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols of Formulae Ia or Ib, respectively, wherein X is selected from cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 12 to 14 ring carbon atoms. Some illustrative non limiting examples of dihydric phenols of Formula Ib include EMI10.1 EMI11.1 EMI12.1 EMI13.1 The novel dihydric phenols of Formula I, and particularly those of Formulae Ia and Ib, are prepared by the reaction of a particular ketone with a phenol in the presence of an acid catalyst, preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst and a cocatlyst such as butyl mercaptan. The particular ketone reactant is selected from ketones represented by the general formulaEMI13.2 wherein R1, m and X are as defined hereinafore. Pre ferred ketones are those wherein X represents a mono cyclic cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. More preferred ketones are those wherein X represents a cycloalkylidene radical containing from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, while the most preferred ketones are those wherein X represents a cyclaolkylidene radical containing from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. More particularly, the ketone of Formula III may be represented by the general formulaEMI14.1 wherein R1 is as defined hereinafore, Y is selected from alkylene radicals containing from 7 to about 15 carbon atoms which together with theEMI14.2 radical form a monocyclic structure containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and m represents a whole number having a value of from 0 up to the number of hydrogen atoms present on Y for replacement. The phenol reactants are selected from phenols represented by the general formula EMI15.1 wherein R and n are as defined hereinafore. The preferred phenol reactants of Formula V, from the standpoint of providing dihydric phenols which yield polycarbonates exhibiting particularly good heat resistances, are those wherein n is zero. In order to obtain the novel dihydric phenols of Formula I, and particularly of Formulae Ia andIb, one mole of the ketone of Formula IV is reacted with two moles of the phenol of Formula V in the presence of an acid catalyst, and preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst and a cocatalyst such as butyl mercaptan. Generally, the phenol reactant is present in excess. Rather than utilizing only one phenol reactant a mixture of two or more different phenol reactants may be employed. Some illustrative non limiting examples of suitable acid catalysts that may be employed include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, poly styrene sulfonic acid , sulfuric acid, benzene sulfonic acid, and the like. The phenol of Formula V is reacted with the ketone of Formula IV under conditions of tempertaure and pressure, and in the presence of the acid catalyst, such that coreaction between said phenol and said ketone will occur to form the dihydric phenol of Formula I, and more particularly ofFormulae Ia and Ib. Generally, the reaction proceeds satisfactorily at about one atmosphere of pressure and at a temperature of from about room temperature 25 C to about 100 C. The amount of the acid catalyst employed is a catalytic amount. By catalytic amount is meant an amount effective to catalyze the reaction between the ketone and the phenol to produce the dihydric phenol. Generally, this amount is in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 percent, by weight. However, in actual practice it is usually somewhat higher since the water coproduct formed in the reaction dilutes the acid catalyst and renders it somewhat less effective slowing the reaction than in its undiluted state. In the preparation of the carbonate polymers of the instant invention only one dihydric phenol ofFormula I may be employed, or a mixture of two or more different dihydric phenols of Formula I may be used. The carbonate precursor that is reacted with the dihydric phenol of Formula I may be a carbonyl halide, a diaryl carbonate, or a bishaloformate. The preferred carbonate precursors are the carbonyl halides.The carbonyl halides are selected from carbonyl chloride, carbonyl bromide, and mixtures thereof. The preferred carbonyl halide is carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. The novel linear carbonate polymers of the instant invention contain at least one recurring structural unit represented by the general fromulaEMI17.1 wherein R1 and m are as defined hereinafore, and X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, preferably from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and more preferably from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms In order for the polycarbonates of the instant invention to exhibit improved heat resistances it is important that there be no alkyl substituent groups on the two aromatic residues.Thus, for example, if the polycarbonate is dialkyl substituted, i.e., there is present one alkyl group on each of the aromatic rings, its heat resistance will be inferior as compared to a similar polycarbonate which does not contain any alkyl substituents of the aromatic rings. These high molecular weight linear aromatic carbonate polymers generally have a number average molecular weight in the range of from about 5,000 to about 200,000, preferably in the range of from about 10,000 to about 100,000. Also included herein are the linear thermoplastic randomly branched polycarbonates. These randomly branched polycarbonates may be prepared by coreacting i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, and iii a minor amount of a polyfunctional organic compound. The polyfunctional organic compound is generally aromatic in nature and functions as a branching agent. This polyfunctional aromatic compound contains at least three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl, haloformyl, carboxylic anhydride, and the like. Some typical polyfunctional aromatic compounds are disclosed inU.S. Patent Nos. 3,635,895 and 4,001,184, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.Some illustrative non limiting examples of these polyfunctional aromatic compounds include trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellityl trichloride, mellitic acid, and the like. One method of preparing the high molecular weight linear aromatic carbonate polymers of the instant invention involves the heterogeneous interfacial polymerization system utilizing an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent such as methylene chloride, at least one dihydric phenol represented by the general Formula I, and preferablyIa or Ib, a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, a catalyst, and a molecular weight regulator. Another useful method for preparing the linear carbonate polymers of the instant invention involves the use of an organic solvent system, such as pyridine, wherein said organic solvent system may also function as an acid acceptor, at least one dihydric phenol represented by Formula I, and preferably FormulaeIa or Ib, a molecular weight regulator, a catalyst, and a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. The catalysts which are employed herein can be any of the suitable catalysts that aid the polymerization reaction of a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precusror such as phosgene to produce a polycarbonate. Suitable catalysts include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, quaternary ammonium compounds, and quaternary phosphonium compounds. The molecular weight regulators employed may be any of the known compounds which regulate the molecular weight of the carbonate polymer by a chain terminating mechanism. These compounds include, but are not limited to, phenol, tertiary butyl phenol, chromanI, and the like. The temperature at which the phosgenation react ion proceeds may vary from below 0 C to above 100 C. The reaction proceeds satisfactorily at temperatures from room temperature 25 C to about 50 CC. Since the reaction is exothermic, the rate of phosgene addition or the use of a low boiling solvent such as methylene chloride may be used to control the reaction temperature. The carbonate polymers of the instant invention may optionally have admixed therewith certain commonly known and used additives such as antioxidants antistatic agents fillers such as glass fibers, mica, talc, clay, and the like impact modifiers ultraviolet radiation absorbers such as the benzophenones, benzotriazoles, cyanoacrylates, and the like plasticizers hydrolytic stabilizers such as the epoxides disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,489,716, 4,138,379 and 3,839,247, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference color stabilizers such as the organophosphites disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,305, 520 and 4,118,730, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference flame retardants and the like. Some particularly useful flame retardants are the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulfonic acids such as those disclosed, inter alia, in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,933,734 3,948,851 3,926,908 3,916,167 3,909,490 3,853,396 3,931,100 3,978,024 3,953,399 3,917,559 3,951,810 3,940,366, 3,775,367 and 3,836, 490, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Particularly useful additives, from the standpoint of providing polycarbonates exhibiting improved heat resistance and good impact properties, are the impact modifiers. Thus, another embodiment of the instant invention is an impact modified linear polycarbonate composition comprised of, in physical admixture i at least one linear polycarbonate containing at least one recurring structural unit of Formula II, and preferably of Formula Ila and ii an impact modifier composition comprising an impact modifier which improves the impact properties of said polycarbonate, said impact modifier composition being present in quantities which are effective to improve the impact properties of said polycarbonate composition. Generally , any material known to impact modify aromatic polycarbonates should be useful in upgrading the impact properties of the polycarbonates of this invention. Examples of these impact modifiers include, but are not limited to, the following general categories polyacrylates polyolefins rubbery dienic polymers and styrenic polymers. The polyacrylates which may be employed as impact modifiers are rubbery homopolymers or copolymers. In general the polyalkyl acrylates described in Brinkman et al., United States Patent 3,591,659, incorporated herein by reference, can be used, especially those containing units derived from alkyl acrylates, particularly n butyl acrylate. Acrylate containing copolymers wherein the other monomer is, for example, derived from a methacrylate are also readily employable, see for example Japanese PatentApplication Announcement 1968 18611, incorporated herein by reference. Preferably the acrylate resin will be in the form of a rubber elastic graft copolymer having a glass transition temperature below about 20 C, preferably below about 40 C. Schlichting,United States Patent 4,022,748, incorporated herein by reference.More preferably, the acrylate resin will comprise a multiple stage polymer having a rubbery first stage core and a thermoplastic hard final stage shell , see Farnham United States Patent 4,096, 202, incorporated herein by reference. The most preferred acrylate resin is a multiphase composite interpolymer comprised of a C1 C5 acrylate and a C1 C5 methacrylate. These interpolymers consist of about 25 to 95 weight percent of a first elastometic phase polymerized from a monomer system comprising about 75 to 99.8 weight percent of a C1 C5 alkyl acrylate, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight cross linking monomer, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of graftlinking monomer, and about 75 to 5 weight percent of a final rigid thermoplastic phase polymerized in the presence of said elastomeric phase. The crosslinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition polymerizable reactive groups all of which polymerize at substantially the same rate of reaction,Suitable crosslinking monomers include polyacrylic and polymethacrylic esters of polyols such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like di and trivinyl benzene, vinyl acrylate and methacrylate, and the like. The preferred crosslinking monomer is butylene diacrylate. The graftlinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition polymerizable reactive groups, at least one of which polymerizes at substantially different rates of polymerization from at least one other of said reactive groups. The function of the graft linking monomer is to provide a residual level of unsaturation in the elastomeric phase, particularly in the latter stages of polymerization and, consequently, at or near the surface of the elastomer particles. When the rigid thermoplastic phase is subsequently polymerized at the surface of the elastomer, the residual unsaturated addition polymerizable reactive group contributed by the graft linking monomer participates in the subsequent reaction so that at least a portion of the rigid phase is chemically attached to the surface of the elastomer. Among the effective graft linking monomers are alkyl group containing monomers of alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated acids such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, and allyl acid itaconate. Somewhat less preferred are the diallyl esters of polycarboxylic acids which do not contain polymerizable unstauration. The preferred graftlinking monomers are allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate. A most preferred interpolymer has only two stages, a first stage comprising about 60 to 95 percent be weight of the interpolymer and being polymerized from a monomer system comprising 95 to 99.8 percent by weight butyl acrylate, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight butylene diacrylate as crosslinking agent, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight allyl methacrylate or dially maleate as a graftlinking agent, with a final stage polymerized from about 60 to 100 percent by weight methyl methacrylate.The multiphase composite interpolymer Acryloid KM330 available from Rohm and Haas is preferred. This interpolymer is comprised of small quantities of cross linking and graft monomers, about 80 weight percent n butyl acrylate and about 20 weight percent methyl methacrylate. The polyolefins which can be employed as impact modifiers are homopolymers or copolymers.Examples of homopolymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene l, polyhexene and the like. The polymers include the standard high density polymers, low density polymers as well as the new linear low density polyolefins such as the linear low density polyethylene made with butene l or octene l. Other examples of copolymers containing at least one olefin monomer can be employed.For example, copolymers of ethylene and propylene can be employed as the impact modifier as well as a copolymer of an olefin and an acrylate such as ethylene ethyl acrylate, a copolymer available from Union Carbide as DPD 6169. Other higher olefin monomers can be employed as copolymers with alkyl acrylates, for example propylene and n butyl acrylate and the like. These polyolefin polymers can also be reacted with rubbery dienes so as to form terpolymers of the EPDM family such as ethylene propylene diene terpolymers, for example Epsyn 704 available from Copolymer Rubber. Various rubbery polymers can also be employed as impact modifiers. Examples of such rubbery polymers include polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene butadiene and various other copolymers having a rubbery dienec comonomer. Styrene containing polymers can also be employed as impact modifiers. Examples of such polymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, styrene acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile butadiene alpha methyls tyrene, methacrylate butadiene styrene and other high impact styrene containing polymers. Other known impact modifiers include various elastomeric materials such as organic silicone rubbers, organic silicone polysiloxane polymers, polysiloxane polycarbonate block copolymers, elastomeric fluorohydrocarbonas, elastomeric polyesters, and the like. Generally any minimum quantity of impact modifier which positively upgrades the impact strength of the polycarbonates of the instant invention can be employed. Greater than this minimum quantity may be employed as long as the properties desired for a particular application of the polycarbonate are substantially maintained.Generally a minimum of about two weight percent is sufficient to observe an increase in the impact strength. A minimum of about four weight percent is preferred. A level of about fifteen weight percent should generally not be exceeded, preferably about 10 weight percent. Weight percent is measured as the amount of the impact modifier in the total of impact modifier plus the aromatic polycarbonate resin of this invention. The impact modified compositions of this invention may be compounded in the usual manner, for example by blending the resin with the impact modifier in dry form, for example powder or granules and the like, and then extruding the composition.

Still another embodiment of the instant invention are copolyester carbonates derived from i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydric phenol represented by Formula I, preferably FormulaIa, and more preferably Formula Ib, and iii at least one difunctional carboxylic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof. Briefly stated, the copolyester carbonates comprise recurring carbonate groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the linear polymer chain, in which at least some of the carboxylate groups and at least some of the carbonate groups are bonded directly to the ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These copolyester carbonates contain ester bonds and carbonate bonds in the polymer chain, wherein the amount of the ester bonds is in the range of from about 25 to about 90 mole , preferably from about 35 to about 80 mole . For example, 5 moles of bisphenol A reacting completely with 4 moles of isophthaloyl dichloride and 1 mole of phosgene would give a copolyester carbonate of 80 mole ester bonds. Conventional copolyester carbonates in general, and methods for their preparation, are disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,169,121, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In general, any difunctional carboxylic acid conventionally used in the preparation of linear polyesters may be utilized in the preparation of the linear copolyester carbonate resins of the present invention. The carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, and aromatic carboxylic acids. These acids are disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,169,121. The difunctional carboxylic acids which may be utilized in the preparation of the linear copolyester carbonate resins of the instant invention generally conform to the general formulaVIII.

Preferred radicals represented by R5 are the monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, with the alkyl radicals being the preferred monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Mixtures of two or more different difunctional acids may be employed as well as single individual difunctional carboxylic acids. Therefore, where the term difunctional carboxylic acid is used herein it is meant to include mixtures of two or more different difunctional carboxylic acids as well as single difunctional carboxylic acids.

A particularly useful mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid is one wherein the weight ratio of isophthalic acid to terephthalic acid is in the range of from 1 10 to 9.8 0.2. Rather than utilizing the difunctional carboxylic acids per se it is preferred to employ their ester forming reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides. Particularly useful acid halides are the acid chlorides. Thus, for example, instead of using isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or mixtures thereof it is preferred to utilize isophthaloyl dichloride, terephthaloyl dichloride, or mixtures thereof.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In order to more fully and clearly illustrate the present invention the following examples are set forth. It is intended that the examples be considered as illustrative rather than limiting the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. In the examples all parts and percents are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. The following examples illustrate polycarbonates falling outside the scope of the instant invention and are presented for comparative purposes only.

At the end of the addition period the pH of the aqueous phase was 11.7 and the bisphenol A content of this phase was less than 1 part per million ppm as determined by ultraviolet analysis. The methylene chloride phase was separated from the aqueous phase, washed with an excess of dilute 0.OlN aqueous HC1 and then washed three times with deionized water. The polymer was precipitated by steam and dried at 95 C. The re sultant, pure bisphenol A polycarbonate, which had an intrinsic viscosity IV in methylene chloride at 25 C of 0.572 dl gm., was fed to an extruder, which extruder was operated at about 550 F, anc the extrudate was comminuted into pellets.

The second order glass transition temperature is determined using a Perkins Elmer DSC 2B instrument which measures the second order glass transition temperature Tg by differentiai scanning calorimetry. The Tg is an indication of the heat resistance of the polymer. Generally, the higher the Tg the more heat resistant is the polymer.

Sufficient 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to this reaction mixture to maintain a pR of about 11. Phosgene is then introduced into the reaction mixture at a rate of 36 grams per minute for a period of 32 minutes while maintaining the pH at about 11 by the use of the aqueous caustic solution. After addition of the phosgene ceases the methylene chloride phase is separated from the aqueous phase, washed with dilute 0.01N HCI, and then washed three times with deionized water.The polymer is then precipitated by steam and dried at 95 C.

Heat was applied via a heating mantel and when the reaction mixture became liquid at 580C anhydrous hydrogen chloride was introduced until the solution became saturated. Stirring was continued between 52 and 60 C for several hours, during which period white solids began to separate out from the reddishorange reaction mixture. When gas chromatographic analysis of samples taken from the slurry indicated the absence of macrocyclicketone, the warm reaction mixture was filtered by suction and the resultant filter cake was washed with methylene chloride in order to remove much of the excess phenol.The filter cake was then slurried up with fresh methylene chloride, filtered and rinsed again with more solvent. Analysis by gas chromatography of the dried filter cake, which weighed 849.8 grams C2.4l moles , corresponding to a 92 yield, and melted at 207 208.5 C, indicated that it was 99.9 pure and that it had a retention time of 26.07 minutes relative to p cumylphenol, which emerged at 13.91 minutes. .EXAMPLE 9 This example illustrates the preparation of l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclodecane.

Into a solution of 1 gram 0.006 mole of cycloundecanone, 3.8 grams 0.04 mole of phenol, 2 milliliters of methylene chloride, and 0.1 milliliter of n butyl mercaptan there is introduced, with stirring, anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at about 14 16 C. Solids begin to separate out from the reaction mixture and when the reaction mixture becomes too thick to stir additional methylene chloride is added. The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When gas chromatographic analysis of the samples indicates the absence of the macrocyclic ketone the reaction mixture is filtered by suction and the solids are washed with methylene chloride. The solids are recrystallized from aqueous methanol.Analysis by gas chromatography of the white crystals, which melt at 183 184 C, shows that they have a retention time of 25.57 minutes relative to p cunyl phenol which emerges at 14.04 minutes. EXAMPLE 11 This example illustrates the preparation of 1,1 b is 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentadecane. Into a warm reaction mixture, kept at about 48 C, consisting of 5 grams 0.0223 mole of cyclopentadecanone, 47.1 grams 0.5 mole phenol, and 0.5 milliliter of n butyl mercaptan there is introduced anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas while maintaining the temperature at about 480C. Solids begin to separate out of the liquid phase. The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When gas chromatographic analysis of these samples indicates the absence of the macrocyclic ketone the reaction mixture is filtered and the solids are washed with methylene chloride. The solids are then recrystallized from aqueous methanol to yield the pure bisphenol. Analysis by gas chromatography of the solids, which melt at 229 230.50C, shows that they have a retention time of 30.00 minutes relative to p cumyl phenol which emerges at 15.83 minutes. The following examples illustrate the polymers of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 12 This example illustrates the preparation of a polycarbonate derived from l,1 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl cyclododecane.

After the addition of phosgene ceased the methylene chloride phase was separated from the aqeuous phase, washed with an excess of dilute 0.01N aqeuous HC1, and then washed three times with deionized water.The polymer was precipitated with methanol and dried at 95 C. The second order glass transition temperature,Tg, of this polymer was determined to be 240.4 C. EXAMPLE 13 This example illustrates the preparation of a polycarbonate derived from l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentadecane. Into a reaction mixture containing 4.1 grams O.01 mole of 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentade cane, 0.03 milliliter of triethylamine, 0.004 gram of phenol, 200 milliliters of methylene chloride, and 150 milliliters of water there was added sufficient 25 aqeuous sodium hydroxide solution to bring the pH to about 11. Phosgene was then introduced into this well stirred reaction mixture at a rate of 0.2 gram per minute for a period of 20 minutes while maintaining the pH of the reaction mixture at about 11 by the use of the aqueous caustic solution. After addition of the phosgene ceased the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes, the methylene chloride phase was separated from the aqueous phase and was washed once with dilute 0.01N HC1 and three times with deionized water.The polymer was then precipitated with methanol and dried at 950C. This polymer had an intrinsic viscosity in methylene chloride at 25 C of 0.38 dl gm. The Tg of this polycarbonate was determined to be 188 C. E AMPLE 14 This example illustrates the preparation of a carbonate copclymerde2ived from 50 mole bisphenolA and 50 mole I,l bi 4 hydrxyphenyl cyclododecane. Into a mixture o 42.1 grams 0.125 mole of 4,4 cyclododecylidene bisphenol, 28.5 grams 0.125 mole of bisphenol A, l .7 milliliter of triethylamine, 0.12 gram S0.5 mole of phenol, 400 milliliters of methylene chloride, and 300 milliliters of water was introduced, at ambient temperature and a pH of about 11, i.e., 10.2 .1.4, phosgene at the rate of 1 gram per minute for a period of 27 minutes while maintaining the pH of the two phase system at about 10.2 11.4 by the addition of a 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After addition of phosgene had been terminated the methylene chloride phase was separated from the aqueous phase, washed with an excess of dilute 0.OlN aqueous HC1 and then washed three times with deionized water.The polymer was then precipitated with methanol. The resultant polymer had a second order glass transition temperature Tg of above 186 C.

After addition of the phosgene had been terminated the methylene chloride phase was separated from the aqueous phase, washed with an excess of dilute 0.01N aqueous HC1 and then washed three times with deionized water.The polymer was precipitated with steam and dried at 95 C. The resultant polycarbonate, which had an intrinsic viscosity in methylene chloride at 25 C of 0.475 dligm, was fed to an extruder, which extruder was operated at about 550 F, and the extrudate was comminuted into pellets. The pellets were then injection molded at about 600 F into test bars of about 5 x 1 2 x 1 16 thick. The Heat Distortion TemperatureUnder Load DTUL of the test bars was determined according to ASTM D 648, at 264 psi. The DTUL of the test bars was 142.5 C. The following example illustrates the preparation of a copolyester carbonate resin of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 16 To a reactor vessel there were added 400 milliliters of methylene chloride, 300 milliliters of water, 35.2 grams of 4,4 cyclododecylidenebisphenol, 0.09 grams of phenol, and 0.28 milliliter of triethylamine. At a pH of about 11, 5.1 grams of isophthaloyl dichloride were added over a 15 minute period while maintaining the pH at about 11 by the addition of 35 aqueous caustic solution.After the addition of the isophthaloyl dichloride was terminated 8.9 grams of phosgene were introduced over a 15 minute period while maintaining the pH at about 11 by the introduction of the 35 aqueous caustic solution. The polymer mixture was diluted with methylene chloride and the brine phase was separated.The resultant polymer containing organic phase was washed with HCl and then with water, and the polymer was recivered by methanol precipitation.
