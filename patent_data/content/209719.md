# Triethylenediamine containing acetylenic alcohols as flow aids.

## Abstract
The flowability of stored triethylenediamine is improved by admixing with a flow promoting amount of a C₅ C₂₈ acety lenic alcohol. Especially suitable as a flow promoting additive for triethylenediamine is a mixture of 3,6 dimethyl 1 heptyne 3 o1 and 3,5,8,10 tetramethyl 6 dodecyn 5,8 diol.
