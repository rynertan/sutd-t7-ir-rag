# MODULAR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR AND SYSTEM FOR MOLDING CONTACT SUPPORTING MODULES

## Abstract
A modular electrical telephone connector for mating with a complementary connector having a plurality of con tact elements. The connector includes a molded plastic common housing and a set of contact supporting modules. Each module defines a different termination configuration for the connector and is interchangeably nestable in the housing. The modules of the set thereof each supports a plurality of contact elements different from the contact ele ments of other modules of the set. The contact elements each includes an identical mating portion at one end of the housing when the respective module is nested therein for mating with a contact element of the complementary con nector, and a termination portion at the other end of the housing forming a termination configuration defined by the selected module. A system and method of molding all plas tic contact supporting modules or connector bodies is provided and includes providing at a first location mold means for molding common housings, and providing at each of a plurality of different locations mold means for molding different contact supporting modules. A system and method is provided for fabricating connector bodies having a mating part and a terminating part in one piece or in two pieces.
