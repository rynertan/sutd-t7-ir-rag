## Abstract
A method for stabilizing the activity of an immobilized fibrinolytic enzyme against sterilization or lapse of time by reating with a basic amino acid the surface of a carrier on which said enzyme is immobilized. In accordance with this method, an anti thrombic material that has high stability and which is suitable for use in medical fields is obtained.
