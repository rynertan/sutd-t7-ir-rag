# Indicator for measuring thickness.

## Abstract
A distance indicating device comprising a probe 1 hav ing therein a light source 51 and light sensitive element 52 to receive light reflected from the surroundings 18, 19 of said probe. A reference point 7 movable relative to said probe, 1 the light sensitive element 52 giving rise to an electric signal. A first storage means 24 to store a signal representing the maximum reflected light returned to said light sensitive ele ment. A second storage means 29 to store a signal represent ing the light returned to said light sensitive element 52 rep resenting the minimum reflected light. A selection means 26 to select a signal level between said maximum and minimum stored signals and a measuring element to measure the dis tance between the reference point 7 and a further reference point 6 , associated with said probe, 1 when said signal level reaches the selected signal level.
