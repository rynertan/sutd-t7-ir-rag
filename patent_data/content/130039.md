# Co metathesis of triglycerides and ethylene.

## Abstract
The co metathesis reaction of ethylene and triglycerides having fatty acid esters containing isolated carbon carbon double bonds produces modified triglycerides and alpha olefins. The reaction can be effected at an ethylene partial pressure of about 200 to 550 psig 1.38 to 3.79 MPa , in the presence of a catalvtically effective amount of a metathesis catalyst and at a temperature of about 100 F. to 500 F. 37.8 to 260.0 C .
