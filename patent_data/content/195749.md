## Description
USE OF BENZYDAMINE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE TRICHOMONASVAGINALIS AND GARDNERELLA VAGINALIS INFECTIONS INTRODUCTIONBenzydamine is a drug having the following structural formula EMI1.1 By a previous Italian Patent Application Ser. No.16898 63, filed on August 9, 1963 , then extended to other countries, inclusive of the U.S. US Patent No. 3 381 905 , there have been claimed the analgesic, antiphlogistic and muscle relaxant properties of such pro duct. The analgesic and antiphlogistic properties of benzydamine have been subsequently confirmed and studied in detail, both in the laboratory animal and in humans MEGA M. et al. Clin. Exp. Obstet. Gynecol.4,19 27, 1977 FROOM J. et al. Curr. Ther. Res.26,856 861, 1979 KOPERA M. Inflammation Proc. Int.Symp., Bologna 1967 Eds. SILVESTRINI et al. ExcerptaMed. Foundation, Amsterdam, 100 106,1968 DELL ORTO R.et al. Clin. Europ. 7,296 303, 1968 LISCIANI R. et al.Europ. J. Pharmacol. 3,157 162, 1968 SILVESTRINI B. et al. Arzneimittel Forsch. 16,59 63, 1966 .Benzydamine is actually therapeutically employed in many countries, both by oral and by topic administration, as an anti inflammatory medicine.The above mentioned studied led to the discovery of the specific activity of benzydamine against Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis. PRIOR ARTAlthough benzydamine is presently employed also in the treatment of inflammatory vaginites, no one had ever imagined that its therapeutical effects could derive from a specific action either on Trichomonas vaginalis or on Gardnerella vaginalis. In this respect special attention should be paid to a previous clinical research on the trichomoniasis vaginalis, wherein a specific therapy was studied both alone and in association with benzydamine ARCOLIN D. et al. Clin. Exp. Obstet.Gynecol. 6,50 53, 1979 . The associated therapy proved better than the specific therapy alone, but this result was put down to the analgesic antiphlogistic properties of benzydamine. Accordingly, not even the present study did surmise that benzydamine could have the microbiological properties claimed by this patent.The prior art concerning benzydamine includes also some research relevant to the antibacterial and antifungal action it exerts at concentrations comprised between 0.1 and 0.015 SILVESTRINI B. et al. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 163,61, 1966 SILVESTRINI B. et al. Boll. Chim.Farm. 107, 353 361, 1968 TAGLIAPIETRA L., Boll. Chim.Farm. 109, 374 379, 1970 . Such an activity may be defined of the disinfectant kind, as it is exerted aspecifically both toward bacteria and toward fungi.Besides, it requires relatively high concentrations.Because of these two reasons, it should be regarded as fully different from that directed towards the Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis, claimed by the present patent. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe Trichomonas vaginal is is a protozoan causing infections of the genitourinary tract both in man and in woman. It has an oval shape, a lenght ranging from 5 to 30, a likewise oval nucleus and four distal hamate flagella. Its capability to multiply is so developed that within few days millions of protozoans may be present in the vagina or in the male genital apparatus.The Trichomonas vaginal is is present in a high percentage of vaginal secretions, that according to our experience reaches 25 , even though it does not always cause apparent troubles. These show up presumably under the action of concurrent factors, capable of making said protozoan virulent, or of breaking down the natural defenses. The propagation of the infection is mainly connected with the sexual contagion. The symptoms consist in an increase in the secretions, that become often liquid, ill smelling and not seldom foamy, as well as in pruritus and burning sensation, sometimes affecting also the anal region. The mucosa looks reddened, someti mes granulous, with small sores.What often complicates the clinical picture is the fact that theTrichomonas vaginal is alters the physiological bacterial flora, favouring thus the setting in of overinfections both of bacterial and of fungous type.The Trichomonas vaginal is infections are strongly rebellious to the therapy, and show a tendency to reappear in a more serious form. For this reason the search for new cures is of great medical interest.The antiprotozoonal activity peculiar to benzydamine was studied in vitro on freshly insulated Trichomonas vaginalis.To this end was employed material taken from 12 female patients who, upon direct examination of the vaginal secretion effected by phase contrast microscope, turned out to be infected.The protozoans were kept at 37 OC in Diamond medium, with 10 addition of inactivated horse serum, at pH 6.1 DIAMOND L. J. Parasitol., 43, 488 490, 1957 . 48 h cultures of Trichomonas vaginalis were diluted over a medium containing benzydamine at scalar concentrations. The antiprotozoonal effect was checked microscopically 48 hours later.The Gardnerella vaginalis is a gram variable, small, pleomorph bacillus, forming colonies of 0.25 0.44 mm diameter. It has a beta hemolytic action on human or rabbit blood the microorganism is catalase and oxidase negative, hippurate positive, and may hydrolize starch and maltose with production of acid Piot B. et al., J.Clin.Microbiol., 1982, 15, 19 24 . In order to distinguish it from other vaginal bacteria, the metronidazole and sulfonamide sensitivity test may be employed Bailey R.K. et al., J.Clin.Microbiol., 1979, 9 65 71 . To study the Gardnerella vaginalis was employed the selective medium for insulation propounded by Ison et al. Ison, C.A. et al. J.Clin. Path., 1982, 35, 550 554 , supplied by Oxoid.The medium was enriched with rabbit blood. In order to insulate the Gardnerella vaginalis, the medium was inoculated on the surface with vaginal secretion taken from women whose symptoms were as follows 1. Ill smelling secretion 2. Subjective troubles, such as pruritus and reddening 3. Lack, on microbiological examination, of other com mon pathogenic germs 4. Presence of clue cells in the fresh specimens, that is epithelial cells with granulations or dotting caused by gram negative or gram positive bacteria adherent to the cell surface.The identity of the Gardnerella vaginal is was further checked both through the fermentation tests and by the employ of disks containing metronidazole and sulfonamide, at the doses of 50 and 1000 pg respectively.With a view to establishing the specific effects onTrichomonas vaginal is and on Gardnerella vaginalis the antibacterial and antifungous activity of benzydamine on some representative microorganisms was also studied, making use of the experimental conditions previously described SILVESTRINI B. et al. 1966 .The results obtained are set out in Table 1.Benzydamine displays an activity against Trichomonas vaginal is and Gardnerella vaginalis at concentrations in the region of 10 20 ,ug ml, while its activity against fungi and the other bacteria manifests iteself only at concentrations that are 10 20 times as great. The clinical research was carried out as follows. The patients of female sex who, at the medical examination, complained of vaginal troubles, accompanied with an abnormal secretion and pruritus, were sistematically subjected to the microscopical examination of the vaginal secretion. Thus, it was possible to ascertain the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis in the secretion of 4Q and 20 patients, respectively.The first 40 patients were divided out in homogeneous groups made up each of 10 patients, who were treated as follows A. Three applications a day, in the form of intravagi nal washing made with a standard irrigator, of a 15 benzydamine aqueous solution in isotonic solution of sodium chloride. B. Three applications a day, according to the above mentioned method, of an isotonic aqueous solution of sodium chloride.C. Three applications a day of 2 3 g of a 0.5 Benzyda mine ointment, containing the following eccipients per 100 g 18 g glycerol stearate 5 g decyl oleate 3 g polyoxyethylenated oleic glycerides 2 g cetylstearyl alcohol TABLE 1ACTIVITY OF BENZYDAMINE ON SOME MICROORGANISMES EMI8.1 SEP Studied SEP concentrations SEP g ml SEP and SEP activities SEP SEP SEP M.C.I. tb Microorganisms SEP pH SEP 10 SEP 20 SEP 40 SEP 50 SEP 70 SEP 80 SEP 100 SEP 150 SEP 200 SEP 400 SEP 500 tb Trichomonas SEP 6,1 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb vaginalis tb Gardnerella SEP 7 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb vaginalis tb Aspergillum SEP 6,5 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb niger tb Candida SEP 6,5 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb albicans tb Escherichia SEP 6,5 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb choli tb Staphilococcus SEP 6,5 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb aureus tb 1 g fluid silicone 5 g propylen glycol 0.18 g methyl p hydroxybenzoate 0.02 g propyl p hydroxybenzolate purified water q.s. to 100 gD. Three applications a day, according to the above described method, of an ointment containing the ecci pients only.The study was performed under double blind conditions.The treatments were carried out for two weeks. The microbiological exam of the vaginal secretion and the clinical remarks were carried out at the very beginning, as well as 7 and 14 days after the beginning of the treatments they were further repeated also 15 days later in order to establish relapses if any in the patients who had reacted to the treatments. The results of the microbiological exams are set out in Table 2 hereunder. TABLE 2Effects of benzydamine on the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis in the vaginal secretion.

The best results were achieved by the 0.15 benzydamine aqueous solution, that gave decidedly better results in respect to the reference group.The ointment containing 0.5 benzydamine revealed too a clear therapeutic action, in comparison to the reference group.These tests were carried out on female patients in whom, due also to anatomic reasons, the Trichomonas vaginalis infection is especially difficult to eradicate. Similar or even better therapeutical results can also be obtained on male patients. As concerns the active concentrations, the results obtained in vitro show that it is possible to achieve successful results with concentrations comprised between 0.1 and 1 .The clinical study of the effect of benzydamine on theGardnerella vaginalis was carried out on 20 patients, who were found to be infected with Gardnerella vaginalis twice at three days distance. Ten patients were treated with the above mentioned benzydamine containing ointment, and other ten with the ointment containing the eccipients only.The test was carried out under the conditions employed for the study on Trichomonas, except for the duration of the treatment, which was of 7 days only.
