# CARBON BORON COMPOUNDS IN ELECTRON TRANSFER ELECTRODES

## Abstract
The present specification discloses a mediator com pound for use with an electron transfer electrode the said compound containing carbon and boron. Conveniently the mediator compound is a metallocar borane. In general, the metallocarboranes have greater thermal stability and resistance to chemical attack that the respec tive metallocene analogues. More importantly they allow a much wider range of electrochemical potentials to be as sessed. The following metallocarboranes and complex ions are employed a the bisdicarbollyl complexes of d³, d⁵, d⁶, d⁷, d⁸ and d⁹ transition metal ions, b mixed complexes in which a dicarbollyl ligand for mally replaces a cyclopentadienyl ligand in a metallocene, c bidentate and polydentate complexes containing the dicarbacanastide ligand and d dinuclear and polynuclear complexes containing one or more cyclopentadienyl ligands. As with the previous mediator compounds these com pounds are capable of transferring charge from an enzyme or enzyme complex to an electrode surface when the en zyme is catalytically active.
