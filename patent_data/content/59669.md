# PURIFICATION OF SUGAR LIQUORS WITH ACTIVATED CARBON

## Abstract
A process for the purification of sugar liquors with activated carbon is described. The use of activated carbon with an iodine number at least 1000 and an average particle size in the range of 0.4 mm to 4.0 mm allows for increased flow rates resulting in high yield of purified sugar liquors.
