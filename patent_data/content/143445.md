# PROCESS FOR OBTAINING TRANSFER FACTOR FROM COLOSTRUM, TRANSFER FACTOR SO OBTAINED AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
Antigen specific excreted transfer factor may be obtain ed by collecting material, e.g. colostrum or milk, secreted by the mammary gland of a suitable lactating mammal, e.g. a cow having immunity to the antigen under suitable condi tions such that materials which interfere with transfer factor efficacy are removed so as to obtain transfer factor. Colos trum or milk so collected may be used directly, typically aft er sterilization, or may be treated to further concentrate and or purify transfer factor. Treatment to yield colostral whey containing transfer factor is presently the preferred method for obtaining transfer factor for use in conferring im munity against diseases associated with antigens for which the transfer factor is specific. Cell associated transfer factor specific for an antigen may also be obtained by incubation release from, or lysis of, cells obtained from the collected material. An alternative method for obtaining transfer factor is to recover it from the mammary tissue of a suitable lactat ing mammal. The transfer factor may be used in edible com positions and in pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions and in methods for conferring immunity in a human or lower animal to a disease associated with the antigen. The trans fer factor may then be used to prevent or treat the disease.
