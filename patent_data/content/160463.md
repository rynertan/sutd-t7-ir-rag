# Valve element for use in an ink jet printer head.

## Abstract
A micro mechanical valve element has a valve member formed by a plate member 11 , and a tongue 12 . A fine slit 13 separates the tongue 12 from said plate member 11 at three sides so that tongue 12 is movable. The valve element also includes a valve seat formed by a flat plate portion 21 , with an opening 22 and stop members 23 . The stop members 23 project into the opening 22 and face the tongue 12 of the valve member. the valve element is formed by a process of laying layers of metal on a substrate 31 of glass, forming resist pattern on selected ones of the metal layers, and subsequently removing the substrate, unwanted portions of the metal layers, and the resist patterns by etching methods.
