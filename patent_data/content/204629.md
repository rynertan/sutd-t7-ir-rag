# Voice activated echo generator.

## Abstract
A voice activated echo generator employs digital voice recording technology to digitize several spoken words of au dio using low cost encoding techniques. The audio informa tion is stored in dynamic memory and is played back by reconverting the data back from its digitized form to audio, which then drives a loudspeaker. The echo generator has many design parameters which can be varied, such as, dura tion of recorded speech, voice actuation sensitivity, number of playback repetitions, speech quality, playback speed, play back pitch, and playback volume.
