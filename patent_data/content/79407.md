## Description
METHOD FOR PREPARING A CALCIUM CARBIDE PRODUCT FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of producing a solid substance which upon contact with water liberates a gaseous fuel product.While not wishing to be so limited, it appears that the method of the present invention provides a new process for producing calcium carbide. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Calcium carbide has long been known for its reactivity with water resulting in the evolution of acetylene gas. Heretofore, the production of calcium carbide has been carried out by directly reacting carbon with calcium oxide in an electric furnace as described by Cotton andWilkinson, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry , ThirdEdition, 216 1972 . Due to the high energy costs of such methods, the production of calcium carbide has been restricted. In addition, while the making of acetylene gas from the reaction of water with calcium carbide has long been known, such processes have been limited not only by the cost of carbide but the undesirous by product, line, which is formed. Recently, an improved method for generating an acetylene base fuel gas has been described in our copending European PatentApplication No.80.301997.5 , titled PROCESS FORPRODUCING AN ACETYLENE BASE FUEL GAS . With the advent of such new means of generating a relatively safe, stable energy rich acetylene based fuel gas, a more economical means for producing calcium carbide is needed. Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a means of producing a substance which will react with water to produce an acetylene based fuel gas. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an economical means for reacting calcium oxide and carbon to produce a product having the properties of calcium carbide without the use of an electric furnace. These and other objects of the present invention will be more apparent from the description which follows. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a method for the production of calcium carbide by reacting a uniform mixture of finely divided calcium oxide and carbon with pyrophosphoric acid H4P207 . At the outset, while not wishing to be limited to any theoretical or empirical explanation, it should be noted that as used herein the product calcium carbide refers to the product of reacting calcium oxide, carbon and pyrophosphoric acid according to the present invention, which product is believed to be composed chiefly or in total of CaC2. Indeed, the calcium carbide product of the present invention readily reacts in the presence of water to generate an acetylene base fuel gas, suitable for burning in an internal combustion engine or power plant as described in our aforementioned European application No.80.301997.5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Calcium carbide is produced by reacting a uniform mixture of finely divided calcium oxide and carbon with pyrophosphoric acid. The reaction is carried out preferably by addition of pyrophosphoric acid to the uniform mixture in an amount sufficient to form a paste like mass which under pressure results in a product which on drying is a hard mass. Calcium oxide is readily available from limestone deposits. Suitable carbon sources include coal, coke and charcoal. Both the calcium oxide and carbon should be in a finely divided state to ensure a complete and uniform reaction.If necessary, these materials may be ground separately or in combination. Suitably, the materials are ground to about 60 mesh or finer. After forming a uniform mixture of finely divided calcium oxide and carbon, pyrophosphoric acid is added in an amount sufficient to form a paste of the mixture generally from 20 to 250 Hop207 based on the weight of the mixture is sufficient . Upon addition of the acid, the mixture immediately begins to exotherm with the generation of water vapor. Most suitably the acid is added to the mixture in a confined reaction space, and simultaneously or as quickly as possible after addition of the acid, the resulting paste is subjected to pressure by way of physical compaction e.g. by a ram, disc, etc. . After the reaction is complete, as indicated by a cooling of the compacted mass, pressure is removed. After drying, one obtians a hard mass of calcium carbide, i.e. in the form of a pressed cake. The hard mass of calcium carbide may be subjected to further processing to obtain particles or granules of desired size and shape.Preferably, the hard mass is crushed by rollers and physically treated and screened to a uniform particle size. A particularly desirable particle size is 0.25 inch mesh. In order to enhance the capability of the calcium carbide to be stored without deterioration, it is preferred to stabilize the calcium carbide particles so as to render the same impermeable to air and moisture. This is accomplished by coating the particles of calcium carbide with a film, impervious to air and mositure, preferably composed of nitrocellulose and a polyester resin. In carrying out such a process, one merely contacts the particles of calcium carbide with a slurry of nitrocellulose and polyester resin in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone, isopropyl alcohol or mixtures thereof. After contacting the calcium carbide particles with the slurry, the excess slurry is drained and the particles may be dried, for example in a convection dryer, to yield particles having a film thereon impermeable to air and moisture.While the resulting coated particles are impermeable to air and moisture, upon contact with aqueous liquid activator reagent of the invention described in my above mentioned application Serial No.80.301997.5the coating is broken down or dissolved and reaction occurs to generate the desired acetylene base fuel gas. An example of a suitable slurry for coating the carbide granules is Nitrocellulose RS 10 Santolite aromatic sulfonamide formaldehyde alkyd resin 10 Dibutylphthalate 2 Ethyl alcohol 5 Ethyl acetate 34 Toluene 39 100 The following example is offered to more fully illustrate the invention, but is not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof. EXAMPLE Into a stainless steel cylinder is placed a uniformly blended mixture of 56 grams of calcium oxide 60 mesh and charcoal 60 mesh . To the mixture is added 25 grams of pyrophosphoric acid with stirring to form a pasty mass which is then compressed with a rod piston adapted to fit the inside of the reaction cylinder. The exothermic reaction is allowed to run its course and after cooling about 15 20 minutes the piston is removed from the cylinder together with the hard cake of calcium carbide. The calcium carbide so produced, after crushing to a uniform particle size of 0.25 inch mesh and placing in water, reacts to generate an acetylene base fuel gas. It thus will be seen that the objects and advantages of this invention have been fully and effectively achieved. It will be realized, however, that the foregoing specific embodiments have been disclosed only for the purpose of illustrating the principles of this invention and are susceptible of modification without departing from such principles. Accordingly, the invention includes all embodiments encompassed within the spirit and scope of the following claims.
