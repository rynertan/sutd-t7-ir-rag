## Description
The present invention relates to an optical head for a magneto optical memory as in detail defined in the preamble of claim 1. A magneto optical disc memory allowing erasing and rewriting recorded information in described by N. Inamura and C. Ota in Japan J. Appl. Phys. Further, EP A O 078 673 discloses a magneto optical head assembly for a reflection type magneto optical memory apparatus which uses a laser beam for recording, retrieving, and erasing data on a recording medium wherein the light beam emitted from the head assembly is guided to a fixed position on the recording medium by a light detection apparatus receiving a control signal and by a separate light detection apparatus receiving a data signal and wherein a beam splitter to which a multicoated thin film dielectric body capable of increasing the Kerr rotation angle of the laser beam reflected from the recording medium is positioned in the optical system through which the laser beam passes. Also that known assembly, however, suffers from a low S N ration. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an optical head through which information recorded on a perpendicular magnetic thin film by magnetisation can be reproduced by directing a laser beam thereto with a high S N ration. The said object is achieved by means of an optical head as claimed in claim 1 further developments of the present invention may be derived from the subclaims. In a magneto optical information recording and reproducing apparatus such as a magneto optical disc memory the optical head must show a high extinction ratio so that even a slight rotation of the direction of polarisation can be detected with a high sensitivity. The present invention is based on the unique finding that there is a relation between the optical anisotropy of a convergent lens focusing a laser beam onto a magneto optical recording medium a perpendicular magnetic thin film and the extinction ratio of the optical head in that such anisotropy induces a low extinction ratio which decreases the S N ratio. Based on the said finding the present invention is featured in that coincidence is attained between the major axis the phase advance axis or phase lag axis of the optical anisotropy of the lens and the direction of the linear polarisation of the laser beam incident upon the lens so as to improve the extinction ratio of the optical head. To attain that coincidence according to the present invention provides for rotating either the focusing lens itself or the polarisation direction of the laser beam incident upon the lens by using a half wavelength plate placed before the lens.

Fig. 9 is a graph showing an example of the relation between the rotation angle of the λ 2 plate and the extinction ratio. Fig. 1 shows the structure of an embodiment of the optical head for a magneto optical disc memory, according to the present invention. Referring to Fig. 1, a divergent laser beam of elliptical cross section emitted from a semiconductor laser device 1 is turned into a parallel beam by a collimating lens 2 of rotation symmetry configuration, and is then turned by a prism 3 into a parallel beam in which the beam intensity distribution in cross section is circular, i.e. isotropic. The prism 3 is provided for tuning the incident beam into a parallel beam of circular cross section as described above. However, the optical element in the system for providing such a beam configuration is in no way limited to the prism, and at least one cylindrical lens can also be used for that purpose. Further, without the use of such a prism or a cylindrical lens, the numerical aperture of the collimating lens 2 may be suitably selected so that the collimating lens 2 can single provide the parallel beam of circular cross section. After passing through a beam splitter a polarizing prism 4, the parallel beam is converged by a focusing lens 5 of rotation symmetry configuration into a bean spot of diffraction limit which is incident upon a magneto optical disc 6 including a recording film a perpendicular magnetic thin film 6a. The magneto optical disc 6 is adapted to be rotated by a drive motor not shown . The magneto optical disc 6 is comprised of a transparent substrate 6b, a recording film 6a and a protective layer 6c. The recording film 6a is in the form of a perpendicular magnetic thin film whose principal component is, for example, Tb Te and which has a thickness of about 100nm. The protective layer 6c covering the recording film 6a is formed of, for example, SiO₂ and has a thickness of about 140nm. Further, spiral or concentric guide tracks not shown of phase structure acting as an optical guide for the beam spot may be provided on the recording film 6a with a pitch of, for example, 1.6 µm, when so required. One complete rotation of each guide track is divided into many sectors. Each of the individual sectors includes a header part and a data recording part. In the header part, contents required for management of information in the specific sector are provided in the form of, for example, a phase structure concave and convex pits , as required and include the sector mark indicating the head of the specific sector, the synchronizing signal and the address such as the track number and the sector number used for the indentification of the specific sector. In the data recording part, information is recorded by mangetization. The header information may be provided in the guide tracks or on the flat area between the guide tracks. An electromangetic coil 7 is disposed opposite to the disc 6 for applying a recording and erasing magnetic field. The convergent lens focusing lens 5 is mounted on a voice coil not shown so as to be moved to follow up vertical deflection of the disc 6. A mirror 12, such as, for example, a galvano mirror is provided so that the beam spot can be shifted to follow up any eccentiricity of the disc 6. In the record mode recording information by magnetization, the drive current driving the semiconductor laser device 1 is modulated by an information signal to be recorded. The beam pulse signal corresponding to the information to be recorded is directed toward and onto the perpendicular magnetic thin film 6a of the disc 6 thereby locally raising the temperature of the perpendicular magnetic thin film 6a. As a result, the magnetization of the perpendicular magnetic thin film disappears locally. Then, a magnetic field whose direction is opposite to the direction of magnetization of the surrounding magnetized portion is applied from the electromagnetic coil 7 to the portion from which the magnetization has disappeared locally, so that a domain a magnetization domain having the magnetization of the opposite direction is formed in the irradiated portion only. The process of erasing information recorded or written already on the perpendicular magnetic thin film by magnetization includes supplying a constant current to the semiconductor laser device 1 to direct the laser beam toward and onto the perpendicular magnetic thin film 6a thereby causing the magnetization of the magnetic thin film to disappear once, and, then, applying a magnetic field of the direction opposite to the direction applied by the electromagnetic coil 7 in the record mode, thereby restoring the direction of magnatization of the perpendicular magnetic thin film to the same direction as that of the surrounding non recorded area. Information recorded on the perpendicular magnetic thin film is reproduced utilizing the magneto optical effect represented by the Kerr effect. The Kerr effect is such that, depending on whether the direction of magnetization of the perpendicular magnetic thin film is upward or downward, the direction of polarization of the incident beam rotates slightly in opposite directions respectively. The beam reflected from the disc 6 passes through the convergent lens focusing lens 5 again and, after being split by the beam splitter 4 and then by another beam splitter 8, passed through an analyzer 9 to be reflected by a mirror 13. The beam reflected by the mirror 13 is guided through a lens 14 to a beam detector 10 which detects the magnetization information and the header signal. The analyzer 9 is an optical element which permits transmission of a specific polarized beam compent only. The beam passed through the beam splitter 8 is guided to an optical system 11 which detects the control signals used for the automatic focusing and tracking control. For example, the beam passed through the beam splitter 8 is split into halves by another beam splitter 111. One of the split beams is guided through a spherical lens 112 to a half split beam detector two divided light detector 113 which detects a tracking error signal, if any. The other beam passes through an astigmatic optical system composed of a shperical lens 114 and a cylindrical lens 115, and, after being partly shielded by a knife edge 116, is guided to another half split beam detector two divided light detector 117 which detects a focusing error signal, if any. Such a focusing signal detecting system is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,450,547. The differential output of the half split beam detector two divided light detector 113 is detected by a tracking servo circuit not shown , and the output of the tracking servo circuit is fed back to the mirror 12, which is a tracking actuator, for effecting the tracking control. On the other hand, the output of the half split beam detector two divided light detector 117 is applied to an automatic focusing servo circuit not shown , and the differential output of the automatic focusing servo circuit is fed back to the voice coil mounted on the convergent lens focusing lens 5, for effecting the focusing control. The header signal is also obtained from the sum output form the half split beam detector two divided light detector 113. Various methods for detecting the tracking error and focusing error in the manner described above have been already known, and any one of the known methods is applicable to the optical head of the present invention. For example, the combination of a cylindrical lens and a quarter split beam detector four divided light detector , as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,293,944, may be used, so that the header signal, focusing signal and tracking signal can be detected by a single detection system. Such an optical head is so arranged that it can be wholly or partly shifted to any desired radial position of the disc 6 by a carriage motor such as a linear motor. The basic principle of detection of magnetization information by such an optical head will now be described. Fig. 2 shows the principal parts extracted from Fig. 1. It is supposed that the laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser device 1 is linearly polarized, and the irradiating laser beam passed through the polarization prism 4 is the P polarized beam polarized in the plane of the drawing sheet. The direction of polarization of the beam reflected from the perpendicular magnetic thin film 6a of the disc 6 is rotated by a Kerr rotation angle Fig. 3 illustrates how the rotation of the direction of polarization is converted into a relative magnitude of the beam intensity by the analyzer 9. In Fig. 3, Fig. 4 is a graphic illustration of the expressions 1 and 2 , and the horizontal axis represents the rotation angle Fig. 5 is a graphic illustration of the dependence of the SIN ratio on the value of As described above, the extinction ratio of the optical head is an important factor for determining the S N ratio. Selection of a good extinction ratio contributes to the improvement of the S N ratio. The fact that the extinction ratio is determined by the optical anisotropy of the convergent lens focusing lens 5 will be proved on the basis of experimental date. Fig. 6 shows data obtained as a result of evaluation of the extinction ratio on the illustrated measuring system. In Fig. 6, the horizontal axis represents the rotation angle Fig. 7 is a graph in which the rotation angle of a certain focusing lens around the optical axis is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the extinction ratio ¹ is plotted on the vertical axis. It will be seen that rotation of the lens changes the value of the extinction ratio The result of checking on the state of polarization of the beam having transmitted through the convergent lens focusing lens proves that the beam is no more linearly polarized but is elliptically polarized due to rotation of the major axis. This indicates that the focusing lens functions as a phase plate and that, even when a lens of rotation symmetry configuration is used as the focusing lens, the lens is actually not circularly symmetrical and has an optical anisotropy. This optical anisotropy of the lens is considered to be attributable to, for example, distortion of the glass body forming the lens and misalignment of the lens axis during assembling. It will be seen in Fig. 7 that the extinction ratio The optical anisotropy of the collimating lens 2 need not be strictly specified. This is because the beam splitter 4 reflects almost 100 of the S polarized beam and permits transmission of about 50 of the P polarized beam only, and the transmission of the linearly polarized beam through the beam splitter 4 improves the P S ratio of the linearly polarized beam. In the embodiment discribed above, the focusing lens 5 is rotated around the center of the optical axis of the optical system to attain coincidence between the major axis of optical anisotropy of the lens and the direction of linear polarization of the incident laser beam. However, the coincidence therebetween can also be attained by rotating the direction of linear polarization of the incident laser beam. In such a modification, a λ 2 plate 20 where λ is the wavelength as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 1 is interposed between the beam splitter 4 and the focusing lens 5. This λ 2 plate 20 is rotated around the center of the optical axis of the optical system to cause rotation of the direction of linear polarization of the laser beam incident upon the focusing lens 5 until the direction of linear polarization of the incident laser beam coincides substantially with the major axis of optical anisotropy of the convergent lens 5. The direction of linear polarization of the linearly polarized beam transmitted through the beam splitter 4 is caused to coincide with the major axis of optical anisotropy of the focusing lens 5 by the function of the λ 2 plate 20, and such a laser beam is focused by the focusing lens 5 onto the disc 6 as a beam spot. The beam reflected from the disc 6 passes through the focusing lens 5 and λ 2 plate 20 again and is then reflected by the polarized beam splitter 4. After being then reflected by the polarized beam splitter 8, the beam is guided through the analyzer 9 to the beam detector 10. Fig. 8 illustrates the state of polarization when the laser beam, whose direction of linear polarization P is caused to coincide with the optical anisotropic axis of the convergent lens focusing lens 5 by the function of the λ 2 plate 20, is reflected from the disc 6. The direction of linear polarization of the laser beam transmitted through the polarized beam splitter 4 in Fig. 1 corresponds to P shown in Fig. 8. Suppose that the optical anisotropic axis the phase advance axis or phase lag axis of the focusing lens 5 makes an angle of When the beam reflected from the disc 6 passes through the λ 2 plate 20 again, the direction of polarization inclined by Fig. 9 is a graph in which the rotation angle of the λ 2 plate 20 around the optical axis is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the extinction ratio
