# Preparation of bisphenols.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of bisphenols comprising reacting, in a reaction zone, at least 2 moles of a phenol with a carbonyl compound, at a temperature of from 40 to 95 C, in the presence of an acid ion exchanger, optionally partially modified with a compound having an acidic reacting group and a mercaptan group, and recovering the bisphenols from the reaction zone effluent, characterized in that the reaction zone effluent is contacted with an acid ion exchanger in metal salt form and or a weak base ion exchanger. As a result, it has been found that the formation of undesirable compounds is substantially reduced.
