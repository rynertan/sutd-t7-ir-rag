## Description
Polyesters as Flow Improvers for HydrocarbonsMineral oils containing wax therein have the characteristic of becoming less fluid as the temperature of the oil decreases. This loss of fluidity is generally due to increase in viscosity and or the crystallisation of the wax into plate like crystals which eventually form a spongy mass entrapping the oil therein.It has long been known that various compositions act as wax crystal modifiers and pour depressants when blended with waxy mineral oils. These compositions modify the size and shape of wax crystals and reduce the adhesive forces between the wax and oil in such a manner as to permit the oil to remain fluid at a lower temperature.Various pour point depressants have been described in the literature and several of these are in commercial use. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,048,479 teaches the use of copolymers of ethylene and C3 Cs vinyl esters, e.g.vinyl acetate as pour depressants for fuels, specifically heating oils, diesel and jet fuels. Hydrocarbon polymeric pour depressants based on ethylene and higher alpha olefins, e.g. propylene, are also known. U.S. Patent 3,961,916 teaches the use of a mixture of copolymers, one of which is a wax crystal nucleator and the other a growth arrestor to control the size of the wax crystals.Similarly United Kingdom Patent 1263152 suggests that the size of the wax crystals may be controlled by using a copolymer having a lower degree of side chain branching. It has also been proposed in for example United StatesPatent 1469016 that the copolymers of di n alkyl fumarates and vinyl acetate which have previously been used as pour point depressants for lubricatinq oils may be used as co additives with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers in the treatment of distillate fuels with high final boiling points to improve their low temperature flow properties. According to United Kingdom Patent 1469016 these polymers may be C6 toC18 alkyl esters of unsaturated C4 to C8 dicarboxylic acids particularly lauryl fumarate lauryl hexadecyl fumarate.Typically the materials used are mixed esters with an average of about 12 carbon atoms Polymer A .Our European Patent Applications 85301047, 85301048, 85301675 and 85301676 suggest that the effectiveness of these type of materials may be improved if the copolymers containing very specific alkyl groups such as specific di n alkyl fumarate vinyl acetate copolymers. For example, polymers in which the average number of carbon atoms in the alkyl groups in the copolymer must be from 12 to 14 and that it must contain no more than 10 wt. of copolymer in which the alkyl groups contains more than 14 carbon atoms and preferably no more than 20 wt. of copolymer in which the alkyl group contains fewer than 12 carbon atoms have been found to be particularly effective in certain fuels and polymers with specific longer alkyl qroups particularly effective in other fuels. Our European Patent Application 0061895 A2 describes the use of polyoxyalkylene esters, ethers, ester ethers and mixtures thereof containinq at least two C10 to C30 linear saturated alkyl groups and a polyoxyalkylene glycol aroup of molecular weight 100 to 5000 the alkyl group in the polyoxyalkylene glycol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms as additives for distillate fuels.It has also been shown that in many instances using mixtures of two types of additive will give a synerqistic improvement in cold temperature flow properties especially in distillate fuels. Mixinq can however lead to problems of additive interaction sometimes leading to a reduction in their effectiveness which can cause serious problems for the refiner who may frequently wish to mix large quantities of fuels from different sources and containing different additives for storage purposes an aim of the present invention is to reduce this problem.We have now found that polyoxyalkylene glycol groups may be incorporated into an unsaturated ester copolymer to provide an effective low temperature flow improver for hydrocarbons especially distillate fuels although they may be used in heavy fuels, residual fuels, crude oils and as pour depressants in lubricating oils. The unsaturated ester copolymer into which the polyoxyalkylene group is incorporated may be the types previously proposed as flow improvers for middle distillate fuels. We have also found that when these copolymers are used in distillate fuels the problem of adverse interaction with other additives such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers may be reduced. The present invention therefore provides the use for improvinq the flow properties of liQuid hyrocabon fuel oil of an additive comprising a polymer or copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated ester of weight average molecular weiqht from 1000 to 200,000 containing from 0.1 to 50 by weiqht of polyoxyalkylene groups of molecular weight from 100 to 5000.The polymers of the present invention are preferably used as additives for distillate fuels they are preferably used in an amount from 0.0001 to 5 wt. based on the weiqht of the distillate petroleum fuel oil and the present invention also includes distillate fuel containing such an additive.The polymers used in the present invention preferably have a weiqht average molecular weiqht in the ranqe of 1000 to 100,000, preferably 20,000 to 70,000 as measured, for example, by Gel Permeation Chromatography, calibrated against polystyrene molecular weight standards.The unsaturated esters of the present invention may be derived from ethylenically unsatured mono, di or polycarboxylic acids or mixtures thereof and may be obtained from unsaturated esters or mixtures thereof with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as ethylene, propylene or butene. Examples of dicarboxylic acid esters useful for preParinq the polymer can be represented by the qeneral formula EMI5.1 wherein R 1 and R2 are hydrogen or a C1 to C4 alkyl group, e.g., methyl, R3 is a C8 to C18 average, the average preferred depending upon the use to which the polymer is to be put.R3 may be a mixture of a broad range of alkyl groups such as those used in U.K. patent 1469016 for use as a lubricating oil pour depressant or the specific monomer range of our European Patent Applications 85301047, 85301048, 85301675 and 85301676 for use as distillate additives where they can not only improve low temperature flow and filterability but also lower the cloud point of the fuel and R4 is COOR3, hydrogen or a C1 to C4 alkyl group. Where these types of unsaturated esters are used as raw materials for the production of the polymers of the present invention the polyoxyalkylene group may be incorporated into the molecule during the esterification of the carboxylic acid to produce the ester described above. For example the nolyethylene alycol may be mixed with the alcohol R30H in the appropriate ratio and used to esterify for exampleFumaric acid. The esters of the above formula may be homopolymerised or copolymerised with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as short chain unsaturated esters for example vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl butyrate and alkyl acrylates and alkyl methacrylates. Typical copolymers of the type described above may be obtained by the copolymerisation of a dicarboxylic acid mono or di ester monomers such as dialkyl fumarates with various amounts, e.q., 5 to 70 mole , of other unsaturated esters or olefins. Such other esters include short chain alkyl esters having the formula EMI6.1 where R1 is hydrogen or a C1 to C4 alkyl group, R is COOR or OOCR where R is a C1 to C5 alkyl aroup branched or unbranched, and Rt is R or hydrogen. Examples of these short chain esters are methacrylates, acrylates, fumarates and maleates the vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate being preferred. More specific examples include methyl methacrylate, isopropenyl acetate and isobutyl acrylate.Our preferred copolymers of this type contain from 40 to 60 mole containinq the polyoxyalkylene moiety fumarate and 60 to 40 mole of vinyl acetate.These ester polymers are aenerally prepared by polymerisino the ester monomers in a solution of hydrocarbon solvent such as heptane, benzene, cyclohexane, or white oil, at a temperature generally in the range of from 20 C to 1500C. and usually promoted with a peroxide or azo type catalyst such as benzoyl peroxide azodiisobutyonitrile under a blanket of an inert qas such as nitroaen or carbon dioxide in order to exclude oxygen. An alternative method for incorporating the polyoxyalkylene group into the ester copolymers of the present invention is to copolymerise the above described ethylenically unsaturated esters with an ethylenically unsaturated ester for the formula R COO R Where R is an ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbyl group and R is a polyoxyalkylene qroup. Examples of such esters include polyethylene glycol mono or di oleate, polyethylene glycol mono or di cinamate, polyethylene glycol acrylates etc. For example di hexadecyl fumarate, vinyl acetate and the di ester of oleic acid and polyoxyethylene glycol of molecular weight 600 may be copolymerised to give a copolymer of the inventionAlternatively the polyoxyalkylene group may be incorporated into the ester polymer by producing polymers containing free acid groups and then esterifying with the polyoxyalkylene alcohol or glycol.For example copolymers of maleic anhydride with other unsaturated materials such as vinyl esters, dialkyl fumarates styrene or olefines may be esterified with the polyoxyalkylene alcohol or glycol. The polyoxyalkylene alcohol used may itself be a mono alcohol the other end of the qroup being etherified or esterified so as to introduce a further desirable group in the polymer chain. The polyoxyalkylene alcohol or glycol may be mixed with other alcohols especially the straight chain alkyl alcohols when the products are to be used as additives for distillate fuels.Examples of the polyoxyalkylene alcohols that may be used include esters, ethers or ester ethers of the general formula R O A O HWhere R is Hydroqen, Alkyl, AlkylEMI8.1 A is the polyoxyalkylene segment in which the alkylene group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as polyoxymethylene, polyoxyethylene or polyoxytrimethylene. It is preferred that the polyoxyalkylene segment itself has a molecular weiqht of about 100 to 5000.Examples of suitable alcohols and glycols especially when the materials are to be used as additives for distillate fuels are the substantially linear polyethylene glycols PEG and polypropylene glycols PPG havinq a molecular weight of about 100 to 5,000 preferably about 200 to 2,000. The monoesters of these glycols may be used and esters of fatty acids containing about 1 30 preferably 2 to 30 carbon atoms are preferred and it is preferred to use aC18 C24 fatty acid, especially behenic acid or mixtures of stearic and behenic acids. These esters may also be prepared by esterifying polyethoxylated fatty acids or polyethoxylated alcohols, for example the mono methyl ether of a PEG may be used or a polyethoxylated fatty alcohol such as the commercially available Brij materials.A particularly preferred compound for use as a distillate fuel flow improver especially in narrow boilinq distillates is a copolymer of vinyl acetate with an eauimolar amount of a fumarate ester prepared by esterifyins fumaric acid with a mixture of from at least 95 mole of a mixture of C12 C14 straight chain alcohols and up to 5 mole of polyethylene glycol of molecular weiqht 600. Alternatively an ester polymer or copolymer containing free carboxylic acid or hydroxy groups may be reacted with ethylene or propylene oxide to produce the materials of this invention.The compounds of the present invention may be used as additives to improve the low temperature properties of hydrocarbon fuels such as crude oils, residual fuels and distillate fuels where they lower the pour point, control wax crystal size to improve low temperature filterability and can in some instances lower the cloud point of the fuel.By distillate fuels we mean those fuels qenerally used for diesel vehicles and heating oils especially domestic heating oils generally boiling in the range 1200C to 5000C more particularly 1600C to 400 C. In addition when used in some distillate fuels they have less of a tendency for adverse interaction with other distillate additives than with similar additives which do not contain the polyoxyalkylene group. The compounds may be used on their own but we have found that in distillate fuels they are particularly effective when used in combination with other additives previously proposed for improving the cold flow properties of distillate fuels generally. The additives of the present invention may be used with the polyoxyalkylene esters, ethers, ester ethers and mixtures thereof, containing at least two C10 to C30 linear saturated alkyl groups and a polyoxyalkylene glycol of molecular weight 100 to 5,000 preferably 200 to 5,000, the alkyl qroup in said polyoxyalkylene glycol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. These materials form the subject of European PatentPublication 0061895 A2. Examples of suitable coadditives of this typeare the reaction product of glycols generally the substantially linear polyethylene glycols PEG and polypropylene glycols PPG with fatty acids containing about 10 30 preferably 18 to 24 carbon atoms, especially behenic acid or mixtures of stearic and behenic acids, the esters may also be prepared by esterifyinq polyethoxylated fatty acids or polyethoxylated alcohols.Esters obtained by reacting fatty acids with polyalkoxylated amines or ammonia may also be used.The polymers and copolymers of this invention when used as fuel additives especially distillate fuels may also be used with the ethylene unsaturated ester copolymer flow improvers. The unsaturated monomers which may be copolymerized with ethylene, include unsaturated mono and diesters of the general formula EMI10.1 wherein R3 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is a 00CRg group wherein R5 is hydrogen or a C1 to C28, more usuallyC1 to C17 and preferably a C1 to Cg, straight or branched chain alkyl group or R2 is a COOR5 group wherein R5 is as previously described but is not hydrogen and R4 is hydrogen or COOR5 as previously defined.The monomer, when R2 and R4 are hydrogen and R2 is 00CR5, includes vinyl alcohol esters of C1 to C29, more usually C1 to C18, monocarboxylic acid, and preferably C2 to C5 monocarboxylic acid. Examples of vinyl esters which may be copolymerised with ethylene include vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl acetate being the preferred vinyl ester.We prefer that the copolymers contain from 20 to 40 wt. of the vinyl ester more preferably from 25 to 35 wt. vinyl ester. They may also be mixtures of two copolymers such as those described in United States Patent 3961916. It is preferred that these copolymers have a number average molecular weiqht as measured by vapor phase osmometry VPO of 1000 to 6000 preferably 1000 to 4000.Our polymers and copolymers may also be used in distillate fuels in combination with polar compounds, either ionic or nonionic, which have the capability in fuels of acting as wax crystal growth inhibitors. Polar nitrogen containing compounds have been found to be especially effective when used in combination with the glycol esters, ethers or ester ethers and such three component mixtures are within the present invention. These polar compounds are generally the C20 C300 preferably C20 C100 amine salts and or amides formed by reaction of at least one molar proportion of hydrocarbyl substituted amines with a molar proportion of hydrocarbyl acid having 1 4 carboxylic acid groups or their anhydrides ester amides may also be used. These nitrogen compounds are described in U.S. Patent 4,211,534.Suitable amines are usually long chain C12 C40 primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines of mixtures thereof but shorter chain amines may be used provided the resulting nitrogen compound is oil soluble and therefore normally containing about 20 to 300 total carbon atoms. The nitrogen compound should also have at least one straight chain Cg C40 alkyl segment.Suitable amines include primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary, but preferably are secondary. Tertiary and quaternary amines can only form amine salts. Examples of amines include tetradecyl amine, cocoamine, hydrogenated tallow amine and the like. Examples of secondary amines include dioctadecyl amine, methyl behenyl amine and the like. Amine mixtures are also suitable and many amines derived from natural materials are mixtures. The preferred amine is a secondary hydrogenated tallow amine of the formula HNR1R2 wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl groups derived from hydroqenated tallow fat composed of approximately 4 C14, 31 C16 59 C18. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids for preparing these nitroqen compounds and their anhydrides include cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexene dicarboxylic acid, cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid, dialpha naphthyl acetic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and the like.Generally these acids will have about 5 13 carbon atoms in the cyclic moiety. Preferred acids useful in the present invention are benzene dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and ortho phthalic acid.Ortho phthalic acid or its anhydride is the particularly preferred embodiment.It is preferred that the nitrogen containing compound have at least one straight chain alkyl segment extending from the compound containing 8 40, preferably 8 24 carbon atoms.Also at least one ammonium salt, amine salt or amide linkage is required to be present in the molecule. The particularly preferred amine compound is that amide amine salt formed by reacting 1 molar portion of phthalic anhydride with 2 molar portions of di hydrogenated tallow amine. Another preferred embodiment is the diamide formed by dehydrating this amide amine salt.Other amine derivatives which may be used as co additives are oil soluble amine carboxylic acid salts and or amides e.g. trioctylamine myristate or behenate. Reaction products of polyamines with fatty carboxylic acids such as the product of reacting tetraethylene pentamine with stearic or behenic acid may be used as may fatty amides themselves. The copolymers may be used in combination with one or more additives of the type described above.The relative proportions of additives used in the preferred mixtures of the invention are from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of the ester polymer containina the polyoxyalkylene group to 1 part of the other additives. The total amount of additive used will depend upon the particular fuel but generally we use from 0.0001 to 5 by weight of the fuel.The additive systems of the present invention may conveniently be supplied as concentrates in oil for incorporation into the bulk fuel. These concentrates may also contain other additives as required. These concentrates preferably contain from 3 to 75 wt , more preferably 3 to 60 wt , most preferably 10 to 50 wt. of additive preferably. Such concentrates are also within the scope of the present invention. The present invention is illustrated by the followingExamples in which the effectiveness of the additives of the present invention as pour point depressants and filterability improvers in distillate fuels were compared with other similar additives in the Cold Filter PluggingPoint Test CFPPT which is carried out by the procedure described in detail in Journal of the Institute ofPetroleum , Volume 52, Number 510, June 1966, pp. 173 185.This test is desiqned to correlate with the cold flow of a middle distillate fuel in automatic diesels.In brief, a 40 ml sample of the oil to be tested is cooled in a bath which is maintained at about 34eC to give non linear cooling at about 1OC min, Periodically at each one deqree Centriqrade drop in temperature starting from at least 2 C above the cloud point the cooled oil is tested for its ability to flow through a fine screen in a prescribed time period using a test device which is a pipette to whose lower end is attached an inverted funnel which is positioned below the surface of the oil to be tested. Stretched across the mouth of the funnel is a 350 mesh screen having an area defined by a 12 millimetre diameter.The periodic tests are each initiated by applying a vacuum to the upper end of the pipette whereby oil is drawn through the sceen up into the pipette to a mark indicating 20 ml of oil. After each successful passage the oil is returned immediatelv to the CFPP tube. The test is repeated with each one deqree drop in temperature until the oil fails to fill the pipette within 60 seconds. This temperature is reported as the CFPP temperature. The difference between the CFPP of an additive free fuel and of the same fuel containinq additive is reported as the CFPP depression by the additive. A more effective additive flow improver gives a qreater CFPP depression at the same concentration of additive.Example 1The fuels used in thes Example were ASTM D 86 Distillation C Fuel Untreated CFPP Initial 20 90 Final 0C Boiling Boiling Point Point A 5 182 220 354 385 B 5 196 253 340 363 C 3 222 275 336 360 The additives used wereAdditive 1 a copolymer of a mixed C12 C14 fumarate ester obtained by reaction of 50 50 molar mixture of normalC12 and C14 alcohols with fumaric acid and solution copolymerisation with vinyl acetate in 1 to 1 mole ratio at 60 C using azo diisobutyonitrile as catalyst.Additive 2 the dihebenate ester of polyethylene qly col of molecular weight 600.Additive 3 the dibehenate ester of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 400.Additive 4 was the same as Additive 1 except that 2.5 mole of a polyethylene qlycol of 600 averaqe molecular weight was included in the C12 C14 alcohol mixture used to esterify the fumaric acid and the polymerisation was carried out at 80 C.
