# Plastics material mesh structure.

## Abstract
In order to provide uniaxially stretched and biaxially stretched mesh structures which allow for different specific designs of the interconnecting strands, a special punching pattern is used to provide holes 2, 3 in the starting material 1. The starting material 1 has a square pattern of large holes 2. Further holes are added. These further holes can be small holes 3 which are staggered and in pairs. When the starting material is stretched, the uniaxially stretched structure has transverse bars 9 interconnected by highly orientated strands 6 each of which forks at both ends into further highly orientated strands 8, Providing a structure which is particu larly suitable for soil reinforcement. When the structure is stretched in the direction at right angles to form a biaxially stretched structure, the zones of the bars 9 which are between aligned strands 8 remain as unorientated or partly orientated junctions 19. The remaining zones of the bars 9 are stretched out to form highly orientatcd strands 15, 17. This biaxially stretched structure is particularly suitable for soil stabilization.
