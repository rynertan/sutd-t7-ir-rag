# Amorphous silicon solar cell incorporating an insulating layer to suppress back diffusion of holes into an N type region and method of fabrication thereof.

## Abstract
In an hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell which includes a body of hydrogenated amorphous silicon having layers of differing conductivity 14,16 and 20 with an interface between a photoactive intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer 16 and an incident N type layer 20 of hydrogenated amorphous silicon, the back diffusion of holes into the N type layer is reduced by positioning between the photoactive layer 16 and the N type layer 20 a thin layer 18 of insulator material, such as Si₃N₄, or SiO₂. The solar cell is advantageously fabricated in a glow discharge apparatus.
