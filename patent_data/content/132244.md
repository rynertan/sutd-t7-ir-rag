# Separation material and its preparation.

## Abstract
A separation material of crosslinked agarose in which the agarose is crosslinked using at least one bi or poly functional crosslinking agent, which gives a chain of 6 to 12 atoms between two binding points, on one hand and using at least one bifunctional crosslinking agent, which gives a chain of 2 to 5 atoms between two binding points on the other. The separation material is prepared by crosslinking agar ose in two steps with a a bi or polyfunctional crosslinking agent, which gives a chain of 6 to 12 atoms between two binding points and b a bifunctional crosslinking agent, which gives a chain of 2 to 5 atoms between two binding points, preferably in the order mentioned.
