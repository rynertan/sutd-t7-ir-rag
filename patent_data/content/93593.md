The compounds also possess vasodilitation, bronchodilation, and anticoagulant activities. More specifically, this invention provides pharmaceutically useful imidazopyridine compounds having the Formula I cr Ia EMI1.1 and thei pharmaceutically acceptable salts, wherein R9 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, cr chloro R2 and R3 each are independently hydrogen,C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, allyloxy, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, hydroxy, halo, cyano, nitro, amino, mono or di Cl C4 alkyl amino, trifluoromethyl, or Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy, wherein Q is oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, or a bond, and Z is C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl, or phenyl substituted with halo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, amino, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, or C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl and R4 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, or C1 C4 alkoxy. The Formulae I and Ia represent tautomeric structures. The imidazopyridines having the hydrogen atom on the N l nitrogen atom and having the pyridine nitrogen atom at the 5 position Formula I properly named 2 phenyl 1H imidazo 4,5 c pyridines have corresponding tautomeric forms wherein the hydrogen atom is on the N 3 nitrogen atom Formula Ia, 2 phenyl 3H imidazo 4,5 c pyridines . As Nrunsubstituted compounds, each tautomeric form exists in equilibrium with the other and cannot be prepared or isolated without the presence of the other. For this application, both forms will be considered together and will be referred to as 2 phenyl l 3 H imidazo 4,5 c pyridines, 2 phenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridines, or compounds of Formula I or Ia . A preferred group of compounds for treating mammals are the compounds of Formula I or Ia wherein R1 and R4 are each hydrogen each of R2 and R3 is independently hydrogen,C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, halogen, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, or Z Qsubstituted C1 C4 alkoxy and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred groups of compounds are those compounds wherein R2 and R3 are substituted at the 3 and 4 positions, or especially the 2 and 4 positions of the phenyl ring. Especially preferred compounds as defined above are those where C1 C4 alkyl is methyl, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl is methylsulfinyl, Cl c4 alkylsul fonyl11 is methylsulfonyl, and C1 C4 alkoxy is methoxy. Preferred Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy compounds are those wherein Ci C4 alkoxy is ethoxy or n propoxy, Q is oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl, or sulfonyl, and Z isC1 C4 alkyl, phenyl, or phenyl substituted with halo, c1 c4 alkoxy, or hydroxy. Ccmpounds substituted at the 2 position of the phenyl ring with C1 C4 alkoxy, especially methoxy, or with the preferred Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy substituents, and at the 4 position of the phenyl ring with C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, or Ci C4 alkylsulfonyl are particularly preferred, with 2 2, 4 dimethoxyphenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridine, 2 2 methoxy 4 methylsulfinylphenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridine, and 2 2 methoxy 4 methylsulfonyl phenyi imidazo 4,5 c pyridine being the most preferred compounds. In addition to the inotropic and other activities possessed by the compounds of this invention, we have discovered that certain of the compounds of Formula I or Ia lower blood pressure but do not cause the expected reflex tachycardia, i.e., they appear to possess bradycardic activity. This pharmacological profile can be desirable for a compound used in the treatment of hypertension or heart failure.These compounds are those generally defined as compounds of Formula I or Ia wherein R1 and R4 are both hydrogen, R2 is Z Q substituted C1 C4 alkoxy at the 2 position of the phenyl ring, and R3 is C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, or C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl at the 4 position. The preferred compounds are those containing the preferred functionalities as previously defined. The following definitions refer to the various terms used throughout this disclosure. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. The term C1 C4 alky refers to the straight and branched aliphatic radicals of one to four carbon atoms including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, and tert butyl. The term C1 C2 alkyl refers to methyl and ethyl. The term C1 C4 alkoxy includes the straight and branched aliphatic ether radicals of one to four carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, sec butoxy, and tertbutoxy. The term C1 C2 alkoxy refers to methoxy and ethoxy. The compounds of this invention as represented by Formulas I and Ia may be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. A preferred method of preparation consists of the reaction of a pyridine of the Formula III EMI5.1 wherein A is amino and R1 is as defined above, with a compound of the Formula IV EMI5.2 wherein B is COOH, and R2, R3, R4 are as defined above. The reaction may be performed in the absence of a solvent, but is generally carried out in a suitable non reactive solvent, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylene glycol, pyridine, acetone, phosphorous oxychloride, polyphosphoric acid, and the like, optionally in the presence of a base, such as pyridine or triethylamine, or optionally in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, or optionally in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous pentoxide, or thionyl chloride.Temperatures in the range of 200C. to 250 C. may be employed with a preferred range of 50 2000C. Other similar methods of preparing the compounds are likewise known. Carboxylic acid derivatives of Formula IV may be employed in the above sequence with appropriate modifications in the reaction conditions. For example, an amide derivative of Formula IV may be substituted for the benzoic acid when condensing with the diaminopyridine of Formula III , preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent or base at elevated temperatures, especially in the temperature range of 100 150 C. If B of Formula IV is cyano, the reaction with the pyridinediamine is typically performed in the presence of a catalytic quantity oz an acid, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, usually at temperatures of 120 1800C. If B is a thioamide derivative, the condensation with the diaminopyridine is best effected in a solvent, such as ethylene glycol, at temperatures of 100 1500C. If, inFormula III , A is a halogen, the reaction is performed with the respective amidine derivative ofFormula IV . The intermediate thus formed may be first isolated or generated in situ, followed by cyclization at elevated temperatures, preferably in the range of l00 20O0C. In the preferred scheme above, when the benzoic acid of Formula IV wherein B is COOH is unsubstituted or is substituted with unreactive functionalities e.g., alkyl, halogen, etc. , heating with the diaminopyridine in polyphosphoric acid PPA is the most convenient and preferred method of preparing the respective imidazopyridine. This method was described by Middleton and Wibberley, J. Het. Chem., 17, 1757 1980 , for the preparation of imidazo 4,5 b and 4,5 c pyridines. When the benzoic acids of Formula IV are substituted with groups such as alkoxy, PPA treatment can lead to dealkylation and the preferred conditions for the reaction are by ref luxing the reactants in phosphorous oxychloride or xylene with the azeotropic removal of water. Especially when the benzoic acids ofFormula IV contain phenolic or amino substituents, an alternate method of preparation may be employed. A substituted benzaldehyde of Formula IV wherein B is CHO may be treated with sulfur and morpholine to produce the respective substituted thiobenzoic acid morpholide which on further treatment with methyl iodide gives the S methyl substituted thiobenzoic acid morpholide iodide derivative. Treatment of this intermediate with the appropriate diaminopyridine ofFormula III wherein A is amino in a solvent such as ethylene glycol with heating produces the desired product of Formula I or Ia .By this scheme, 2methoxybenzaldehyde was converted first to 2 methoxythiobenzoic acid morpholide, then to S methyl 2 methoxy thiobenzoic acid morpholide iodide, which on heating in ethylene glycol with 3,4 diaminopyridine gave a product of Formula I or Ia wherein R1, R2, and R3 are each hydrogen and R4 is 2 methoxy. The starting material 3,4 diaminopyridine is commercially available. Other required pyridines ofFormula I II are either commercially available, or may be prepared in the usual manner from available starting materials by the proper sequence of nitrations, reductions, acylations, hydrolyses, halogenations, and aminations. The required benzoic acids and derivatives of Formula IV are either commercially available, are known in the literature, or are prepared by methods known in the art. In addition, some of the compounds of Formula I or Ia may be prepared by subsequent derivatizations of other compounds of Fcrmula I or Ia by methods known in the art. Thus, amine derivatives may be prepared from intermediate halo derivatives, phenol substituents may be selectively alkylated, and the like. Preparation of Sulfoxide and Sulfone Derivatives The sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives of this invention, i.e. compounds of Formula I or Ia wherein R2 or R3 is C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, or C1 C4 alkoxy substituted with a croup Z Q wherein Q is sulfinyl or sulfonyl or Z is phenyl substituted with C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl or C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, can be prepared by reacting the corresponding intermediates of formulae III and IV . Alternatively, a sulfide of formula I or Ia can be oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide of formula I or Ia using any one of a number of methods known per se in the art. The oxidizing agent used is not critical. Typically, the oxidizing agent will be a peroxy acid derivative, such as m chlorobenzoic acid, peroxydodecanoic acid, or sodium periodate, or a positive halogen source, such as t butylhypochlorite, N bromosuccinimide, N chlorosuccinimide, or l chlorobenzotriazole, or an active Mono 2 source.For example, useful oxidizing agents include sodium metaperiodate in aqueous methanol m chlorobenzoic acid in an organic solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride or ethyl acetate t butyl hypochlorite in methanol and hydrogen peroxide in acetone. To prevent overoxidation to the sulfone, it is frequently desirable to use the lowest temperature permitted by the solvent. One equivalent of oxidizing agent is used per equivalent of sulfide. The sulfone derivatives of Formula I or Ia can be preapred by oxidizing the sulfides and sulfoxides of Formula I or Ia .When the sulfone is prepared from the corresponding sulfide, the sulfoxide is an intermediate. Again, the oxidan. used is not critical. Oxiding agents that can be used include hydrogen peroxide, m chlorobenzoic acid, potassium permanganate, sodium dichromate, and t butyl hypochlorite.

After 2 days or more, the animals were decapitated, lungs were excised and perfused through the pulmonary artery with Krebs bicarbonate solution of the following composition in mmoles liter KCl, 4.6 CaCl2 2H2O, 1.8 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4 7H2O, 1.2 Nazi, 113.2 NaHCO3, 24.8, and dextrose, 10.0.Poorly perfused and bloody areas were discarded.Normal lung was cut into 1 mm. cubes with a McIlwain tissue chopper, washed with Krebs solution and divided into 400 mg. aliquots. The fragmented tissue was then incubated at 370C. for 15 minutes in Krebs solution containing indomethacin to optimize SRS A release and an appropriate concentration of experimental drug. Antigen ovalbumin was then added to make a final concentration of 1 x 10 5 g. ml. Fifteen minutes late, the incubation medium was decanted and centrifuged at 3,000 x g at 40C. for 5 minutes. The supernatant solution was collected and assayed forSRS A using a computerized bioassay that employs the isolated guinea pig ileum Fleisch et al., J. Pharmacol.Exp. Ther., 209, 238 243, 1979 . Release of SRS A in the presence of the experimental drug was compared to a control sample and the results expressed as percent inhibition of SRS A release. 2 2,4 dimethoxyphenyl imidazo 4,5 c pyridine hydrochloride inhibited SRS A release 19.4 at 1 x 10 5M and 45.1 at 1 x 10 4M.
