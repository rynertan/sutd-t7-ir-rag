# Cooling device of semiconductor chips.

## Abstract
A cooling device for providing cooling of integrated circuit semiconductor chips 1 is so arranged as to transfer a heat via thin fin members 16, 18 which are fitted with each other with a small clearance 19 .The bottom surface of one of thermal conductive members 17 which is provided integrally with the fin members 18 is made greater in surface area than a back planar surface of the semiconductor chip, 1 , and the thermal conductive member 17 and the semiconductor chip 1 are kept at all times in plane contact with each other, thereby enhancing the cooling performance.
