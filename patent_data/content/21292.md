## Description
The present invention relates to 2,4 diaminopyrido 2,3 d pyrimidines, to pharmaceutical formulations comprising such compounds and to their use in medicine. U.K. patent No. 1 084 103 discloses 2,4 diaminopyrido 2,3 d pyrimidines of the general formula I EMI1.1 in which R1 is an alkyl group and R2 is an unsubstituted benzyl group or a benzyl group substituted by one or more halogen atoms, alkyl or alkoxy groups. The compounds of formula I were described as having high in vitro and in vivo activity against bacteria or bacterial infections in experimental animals. Subsequently it has been found that the compounds of formula I specifically disclosed in U.K. 1 084 103 show some inhibitory activity against mammalian dihydrofolate reductase DHFR , and the activity was sufficient to render them potentially useful in the treatment of conditions where inhibition of mammalian DHFR is desirable. It has further been found that many of these compounds are potent inhibitors of histamine N methyltransferase HMT , an enzyme involved in the metabolism of histamine. In this manner they often cause an undesirable accumulation of histamine in organs and tissues. The effects of histamine are well known and any possibility of a further utility for these compounds was substantially diminished by their strong inhibition of HMT. Further investigation showed that a number of other compounds of formula I also posses DHFR inhibitory activity but that these, too, were also potent inhibitors of HMT. Others, which had acceptably low levels of inhibition of HMT were found to have insufficent activity as inhibitors ofDHFR. It has now been suprisingly found that certain 2,4 diamino 6 dimethoxybenzyl 5 methyl pyrido 2,3 d pyrimidines, which are within the scope of formula I but not specifically disclosed in U.K. 1 084 103, are not only very potent inhibitors of mammalian DHFR, but also have acceptably low inhibitory activity against HMT. These compounds are represented by formula 11 below and are useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as psoriasis, basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, and various forms of cancer including leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas and solid tumors. The invention accordingly provides compounds of formula II EMI2.1 wherein Ar isEMI2.2 and R and R are lower C1 C6 alkyl and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Preferably monobasic salts are provided. Preferably R and R are methyl. Particularly preferred is 2,4 diamino 5 methyl 6 2,5 dimethoxybenzyl pyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine. The antiproliferative activity of the compounds of formula 11 resides in the free base and thus the nature of the acid participating in the acid addition salts is of minor importance. Such acid addition salts include, for example, those derived from hydrochloric acid, hydroiodic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, p chlorobenzenesulphonic acid, isethionic acid, glucuronic acid, pantothenic acid and lactobionic acid. The compounds of formula II may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. In particular the compounds of formula 11 be prepared by the reductive cleavage of the corresponding 7 substituted compound of formula III EMI3.1 wherein Ar is as defined in formula 11 and R3 is a leaving group capable of being removed by hydrogenolysis. Such groups include for example a mercapto or a halogeno eg. chloro group. Where, in a compound of formula III , R3 is SH the dethiation may for instance be conveniently effected by reaction with a reducing agent, for example Raney nickel or Raney cobalt or by catalytic hydrogenation utilizing hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal. Compounds of formula nI wherein R3 is a mercapto group may 3 be prepared from the corresponding 7 chloro compound III R Cl by reaction with a hydrosulfide as described in U.K. patent No. 913 710 or by treatment of the corresponding 7 hydroxy compound with phosphorus pentasulfide. In the case where R3 is a halogen atom in the compounds of formula III , the compounds of formula 11 may for instance be conveniently obtained by e.g. catalytic hydrogenation. The compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reacting 2,4,6 triamino pyrimidine IV with a compound of formula V . EMI4.1 wherein Ar is as defined in formula II EMI4.2 and R4 is a leaving group such as for example a tertiary amino, alkoxy, alkylthio, halogeno, sulphonate or tosylate group. The compounds of formula II may additionally be prepared by the conversion to amino groups, by methods known in themselves in pyrimidine chemistry, of the hydroxy and or mercapto group s in a compound of formula VI EMI4.3 in which Ar is as defined in formula it , and Y and Z are the same or different and are OH, SH or NH2 provided that at least one of Y and Z is OH or SH. Compounds of formula VI maybe obtained by methods known in the art for preparing such compounds. In addition those in which Y is OH or NH2 and Z is OH or SH may be obtained for example by reaction of urea, guanidine or thiourea with a suitable compound of formula VII EMI5.1 in which Ar is as defined in formula 11 R5 is CO2H, CO2 Alkyl, CONH2 or CN andR6 is NH2, C1 or Br. While it is possible for the compounds of formula n or acid addition salts thereof hereinafter referred to as the active compounds to be administered as the raw chemical they are preferably presented in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention therefore further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the active compound together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The invention additionally provides a method for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising bringing into association an active compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. Topical application is particularly suitable when the active compounds are for use in the treatment of proliferative skin diseases. The term topical as applied herein relates to the use of the active ingredient incorporated in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier, and applied at the site of the disease for the exertion of local action. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for topical administration may be presented in anhydrous forms such as ointments, lotions, pastes, jellies, sprays, aerosols, and bath oils. The term ointment includes formulations including creams having oleaginous, absorption, water soluble and emulsion type bases, for example petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of the active ingredient of from 0.05 to 2 w w preferably 0.1 to 1 w w most preferably 0.2 to 0.5 w w. Other pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal and parenteral administration, although of these oral is preferred.The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. A convenient unit dose formulation contains the active compound in amount of from 50 mg to Ig, preferably 100mg to 500 mg, most preferably about 200 mg, to be taken once or several times daily. All methods for the preparation of such formulations include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding an inert liquid diluent.Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may be optionally scored.Capsules may be prepared by filling the active compound either alone or in admixture with one or more accessory ingredients, into the capsule cases and then sealing them in the usual manner. Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein the active ingredient together with any accessory ingredient s is sealed in a rice paper envelope. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a liquid may be presented as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, or as an oil in water or water in oil liquid emulsion. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for rectal adminstration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other material commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier s followed by chilling and shaping in moulds. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration include sterile solutions or suspensions of the active compound in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles. Such preparations are conveniently presented in unit dosage or multi dose containers which are sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like, and substances included for the purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. As has been described above the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases. The invention thus further provides a method for the treatment a of poliferative disease in a mammal including man which comprises the administration of an effective, non toxic amount of the active compound once or several times a day orally, or applied topically. The invention also provides a compound of formula II as hereinbefore defined or an acid addition salt thereof for use in medicine. The invention further provides a compound of formula 11 as hereinbefore defined or an acid addition salt thereof for use in the treatment of proliferative conditions. The amount of active compound required for therapeutic effect as an antiproliferative agent will of course vary not only with the particular salt used but also with the route of administration. In general a suitable dose for the treatment of a mammal induding man will lie in the range of from 0.1 to 100 mg per kilogram bodyweight mg kg per day, preferably in the range of 2.0 to 50 mg I kg, more preferably in the range of 5 to 20 mg kg. Toxic manifestations attributable to the active compounds are typically those associated with folate depletion, such as bone marrow depression, megalobastic changes, and gastrointestinal ulceration. Calcium leucovorin calcium salt of 5 formyl 5,6,7,8, tetrahydrofolic acid may be administered to effect reversal of these toxic manifestations or to prevent their occurrence.The administration of calcium leucovorin may be effected concurrently with treatment or at any stage thereof whenever toxic symptoms appear. Thus, the haematological activity of the active compound can be prevented or reduced by the simultaneous administration of leucovorin.Consequently, tissue levels of the active compound may be safely raised by increasing the dose of the compound together with a simultaneous administration of leucovorin.

One group of rats was treated with 2,4 diamino 6 2,5 dimethoxybenzyl 5 methylpyrido 2,3d pyrimidine at a dose of 25mg kg q.i.d., a second group was treated with the same compound at 15 mg kg b.i.d. the third group were left untreated as controls. After 17 days the treated groups of rats showed mean tumor volumes of 29 and 10 respectively of the untreated group. In a second study tumors were implanted subcutaneously and drug treatment delayed until 10 days after implantation. Drug treatment consisted of 30 mg kg q.i.d. on days 10 13 and 50 mg kg on days 20, 24 and 28 after tumor implantation. Mean tumor volumes were measured during the course of this study. Tumor volume in animals which received no treatment grew rapidly whereas those which received drug treatment showed a decrease in mean tumor volume during the period of observation. Twenty three days after tumor implantation T C was 0.03.EXAMPLE 6 Antileukemic effect of 2,4 diamino 6 2,5 dimethoxybenzyl 5 methylpyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine Leukemia P388 cells were inoculated intraperitoneally in CDF,Charles River female mice, each animal receiving 106 cells. On the second day after implantation with the leukemic cells, drug treatment was commenced and continued twice daily for three days. Four groups of mice were treated with 2,4 diamino 6 2, 5 dimethoxybenzyl 5 methylpyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine at doses of 22, 33.5, 50 and 75 mg kg of body weight and a fifth group was left untreated as a control. All of the untreated mice died from the leukemia between the 10th and 12th day with a median survival of 11 days.All of the treated mice survived for periods longer than the untreated animals with a increases in life span of 145 , 159 , 140 and 154 for the drug treated groups receiving 22, 33.5, 50 and 75 mg kg doses respectively. This is a highly significant effect. There was no evidence of drug related toxicity. Within the same experiment, two closely related compounds were tested for antileukemic activity at the same dosage levels of 22, 33.5, 50 and 75 mg kg, respectively, and with the same schedule of treatment. The corresponding pyridopyrimidine with a 4 methoxybenzyl substituent was inactive at all doses and the 2 chlorobenzyl compound had only marginal or slight activity.Thus, the 2,5 dimethoxybenzyl compound has substantially greater antileukemic activity than those compounds of similar structure.EXAMPLE 7 Water Soluble Ointment amount g 2, 4 Diamino 5 m ethyl 6 dialkoxy benzyl pyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine 0.5Polyethylene glycol 300 20.0Polythylene glycol 1500 77.5Total 100.0 EXAMPLE 8 Skin Cream amount g 2,4 Diamino 5 methyl 6 dialkoxy benzyl pyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine 0.5Glyceryl monostearate 20.0Methylparaben 0.3Petrolatum light liquid 4.0Propylene glycol 5.0Span 60 2.0Tween 61 4.0Water 64.2Total 100.0EXAMPLE 9 Toxicity of 2, 4 Diamino 5 methyl 6 dimethoxybenzyl pyrido 2,3d pyrimidines The acute toxicity of the title compounds was determined in mice i.p. .
