## Abstract
An optically enhanced solar cell having a detached reflector includes a semiconductor material 4 bounded on each side by transparent electrical contacts 2, 6 and an optional antireflection coating 1 , with the surface of at least one of these layers being textured. Light is reflected in the cell by a reflector 10 which is detached from the enhanced cell using a layer of dielectric material 8 .
