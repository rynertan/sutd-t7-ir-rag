# Eburnamonine oxime derivatives and their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
An eburnamonine oxime is of the formula CHEM where R is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, oxisilanyalkyl group or a group CHEM where R 1 and R 2 are each hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group, or R 1 with R 2 and the neighbouring N atom completes an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring, and n 2 or 3. Preparation is from the thione R O N replaceby S by reaction i with hydroxylamine HCL in an organic solvent in the presence of alkali metal carbonate, and ii with a halide of R R not being H or group b , if necessary followed by ii reaction with Halo CH2CH OH 2CH2 NHR 1 R 2 to provide group b , and optionally converting the resultant base to its non toxic acid addition salt. A pharmaceutical composition, e.g. injectable solution, tablet or suppository, is useful in improving cerebral blood flow and metabolism, and therefore for treatment of disturbance of brain function, with a superior effect than that of vinpocetine or vincamine derivatives known alkaloids .
