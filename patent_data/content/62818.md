## Description
INDIUM ANTIMONY COMPLEX CRYSTAL SEMICONDUCTOR AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new indiumantimony complex crystal semiconductor and a process for producing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a new indium antimony complex crystal semiconductor, a thin film of which exhibits properties suitable for use as a Hall element or magnetoresistive element, and a process for producing such semiconductor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A thin film of indium antimony compound has a higher mobility 78,000 cm2 V.sec than other semiconductor compounds, such as an indium arsenic compound 30,000 cm2 V.sec and gallium arsenic compound C7,000 cm2 V.sec .Because of this property, a thin film of indium antimony compound is known to be advantageous for use as a Hall element or magnetoresistive element, and has been getting the increasing attention of researchers as a device that can be used in a position detector for a direct drive motor, or as a component of video tape recorder or acoustic equipment. Two important parameters for the Hall effect of a semiconductor are the Hall coefficient RH and Hall mobility pH . Figure 1 shows an arrangement for measure ment of these two parameters, which consists of a test conductor A having a length Z, width w, and a thickness t not illustrated , on which gold is vacuum deposited to form input electrodes a, at and output electrodes b, b .A voltage VHi is developed between the output electrodes when the input electrodes are connected to a constant current supply I, and a voltage VH v is developed when they are connected to a constant voltage supply V. The two voltages are represented by the following equations EMI2.1 wherein B is the magnetic flux density of an external magnetic field applied, and f is a factor dependent on the configuration of the sample. As equation 1 showst VHi is in inverse proportion to the thickness of the material through which the current flows, and it can be seen that the thickness of an indium antimony wafer to be used as a high sensitivity Hall element or magnetoresistive element should be as small as possible.Since the indium antimony semiconductor has a small forbidden band, its Hall coefficient RH in equation 1 varies greatly with temperature, and VHi, the output voltage under constant current, is largely dependent on temperature in practical applications.On the other hand, the Hall mobility pH in equation 2 is fairly independent with respect to temperature and almost all commercial indium antimony Hall elements are used under constant voltage. Hence, an indium antimony semiconductor having high Hall mobility rather than highHall coefficient is desired. However, no industrial process has to date been known for producing a thin film of indium antimony crystalline structure. Heretofore, it has been considered essential that in a compound semiconductor such as indium antimony, the atomic ratio of the element of group IIIB in thePeriodic Table to the element of group VB should be 1 1 Csee Z. Naturforschung, Vol. 7a, p. 744, 1952 .To make a wafer of indium antimony crystal having an In to Sb atomic ratio of 1 1 for use as a Hall element or magnetoresistive element, a slice of a single crystal of indiumantimony is polished into a thin film, or an indiumantimony composition having a thickness of about 10 um layer is formed on a substrate by vacuum deposition or other suitable means, crystallized by zone melting and then polished to a thin film see Japanese Patent Application COPI No. 9373 75 Cthe term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent applica tion . However, slicing a wafer of InSb single crystal is not an industrially advantageous method, since a large amount of expensive material must be used.In the second method wherein the vacuum deposited InSb layer is crystallized, controlling the In to Sb atomic ratio at 1 1 is very difficult and requires complex procedures, and these are two great limiting factors on the effort to. use this method on an industrial scale. . K.G. G 1nther proposed in U.S. Patent 3,172,778 a process for making a thin layer of IIIB VB compound semiconductor by Vacuum deposition. In that process, Günther sugges.ts.presetting. the temperature of the substrate higher than the decomposition temperature of the compound semiconductor, and depositing more element of VB group than the element of IIIB by controlling the arrival rate ratio of the two elements whereunder referred to as AIn ASb to be 1 or less. The arrival rate ratio AIn ASb as used herein means the ratio of the flux density of In atoms to that of Sb atoms that reach the substrate in the process of vacuum deposition see Physics Status Solid, a , Vol.54, p. 707, 1979 . But even this method requires a complex procedure to control the atomic ratio of In toSb to be 1.0 1 and has the above described defects of the conventional art. Noting that in the prior art the problem in producing a thin film of indium antimony semiconductor is the necessity of strictly controlling the In to Sb atomic ratio, and that therefore the process control can be simplified and hence the desired thin film can be easily produced by expanding the latitude in selection of the In to Sb atomic ratio, the present inventors have conducted various studies to develop an industrial process for making a thin film of indium antimony crystalline structure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide an indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having high crystallinity and high mobility. Another object of the present invention is to provide a thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor, which exhibits properties suitable for use as a Hall element or magnetoresistive element. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing an indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor and a thin film thereof, which is free from the above problems on an industrial scale. Other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the description hereinbelow. As a result of extensive studies, it has now unexpectedly been found that an indium antimony compound that has an excess of indium, and particularly which has an In to Sb atomic ratio in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1 has high crystallinity and exhibits high mobility.This fact disproves the established theory in the art.It has also been found that such compound can be produced easily by depositing the vapor of antimony and indium on a substrate under such conditions that the AIn ASb àrrival rate ratio is from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1. The inventors made further studies to devise an improved process for providing the indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor with even higher mobility, and found that a superior complex crystalline semiconductor having much higher mobility can be produced by controlling the temperature of the substrate by reference to the pressure in the vacuum deposition system. The present invention has been accomplished on these findings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAVINGS Figure 1 is a pattern for measuring the electrical characteristics of a semiconductor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Specific embodiments of the present invention are listed below 1 An indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor consisting essentially of crystals of an indium antimony compound and crystals of indium alone, wherein the atomic ratio of total indium to antimony is in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1. 2 A thin film of the indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor as in 1 . C3 A process for producing an indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor consisting essentially of crystals of an indium antimony compound and crystals of indium alone by depositing the vapors of indium and antimony on a substrate in such a manner thatAIn ASb is controlled to be within the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 l. C4 A process as in 3 wherein the temperature of the substrate is held in the initial period of the vacuum deposition at a level lower than the limiting temperature given by the formula 1 TL 9.98 x 10 4 5.66 x 10 5 logP wherein TL is the limiting temperature of the substrate on the absolute scale C K , and P is the pressure in the vacuum deposition system expressed in Torrs . C5 A process as in C4 wherein the AIn ASb is held at 1.0 1 or below in the initial stage of the vacuum deposition, and, at the same time, the temperature of the substrate CT is held at a level that satisfies the relation Tc T Tc 30, wherein Tc is the critical temperature of the substrate on the absolute scale C K that is given by the formula 1 Tc 1.29 x 10 3.84 x 10 5 logP wherein P is the pressure in the vacuum deposition system expressed in Torrs . 6 A process as in 3 , wherein the vacuum deposition is performed in the presence of nitrogen. The essential feature of the present invention is to provide an indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor wherein the atomic ratio of total indium, i.e., indium in the In Sb compound and indium as the indium crystal, to antimony tor film composition ratio of indium to antimony which is hereunder referred to asFIn FSb is in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1, as well as a process for producing such semiconductor. This feature of the present invention is entirely unexpected from the state of the art. For the purposes of the present invention, the value of F1n F Sb of the indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor must be in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1 because the semiconductor having a value of FIn FSb in this range exhibits a particularly higher mobility than those which have a value outside this range, and it is easier to make a thin film thereof that suits practical purposes. The relation between the FIn FSb and mobility of a thin semiconducting film is shown in Figure 2, wherein the FIn FSb is plotted on the x axis and a fairly accurate measurement of the factor could be made by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The mobility of the thin film is plotted on the y axis. In Figure 2, the symbol A indicates a line for the mobility of 10,000 cm2 V sec, and the region above this line is practical. The thin film has a mobility higher than this line when it has a value of FIn FSb between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1. If the value of FIn FSb is less than 1.1 1, the resulting thin film is fragile and has a high noise level. If theFIn FSb is above 1.7 1, a heterogeneous thin film is made and the commercial productivity of the film is decreased.A particularly preferred range is from 1.2 1 to 1.6 1.If this range is observed, a highly crystalline thin film having high mobility and uniformity, and yet which has a low noise level, is produced. As described above, the complex crystalline semiconductor of the present invention has an excess of indium, and the indium content is variable over a fairly wide range. Therefore, the desired thin film can be produced by an industrially efficient technique of vacuum deposition since there is no need of using excess antimony having high vapor pressure and yet there is an increased latitude in selection of process conditions. The process of the present invention is based on the new finding that if the FIn FSb is in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1, it agrees substantially with the value of AIn ASb, the difference being within experimental error. The process of the present invention that produces a thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor that is very rich in indium is based on the idea of controlling the value of AIn ASb to be within the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1, and this idea is very much different from the established theory.Figure 3 shows how the value of FIn FSb agrees with that of AIn ASb. In Figure 3, the AIn ASb is plotted on the x axis and the FIn FSb is plotted on the y axis.In Figure 3, the symbol A represents a line forFIn FSb AIn ASb, B represents a case for a substrate temperature of 440 C, C represents a case for a substrate temperature of 350 C, D represents a case .for a substrate temperature of 460 C, and E represents a case for a substrate temperature of 4000C. The values of AIn ASb could be determined by a simple preliminary experiment first, the relation between the amounts of indium and antimony that were vaporized from their respective boats and the amounts of their vapor deposited on the substrate was determined for the case where the temperature of the substrate was low, say, at room temperature the flux density of the respective atoms could be determined from the amounts of deposition, and hence, the relation between the amounts of the respective elements that were vaporized from the boats and their flux densities could be determined. The points in Figure 3 relate the FIn FSb and AIn ASb to the actual temperatures at which thin In Sb complex crystalline films were made.As is clear from Figure 3, the values of AIn ASb substantially agree with those of FIn FSb within the range contemplated by the present invention where the FIn Fsb is between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1, so the composition of the thin film produced can be controlled by controlling the AIn ASb. Since the AIn ASb can be controlled simply by controlling the amounts of the respective elements that are vaporized from their boats, the process of the present invention is very useful for industrial purposes. Furthermore, the variation in the mobility of the thin film produced can be reduced to a surprisingly low level by holding the AIn ASb constant. Therefore, the greatest industrial advantage of the present invention is that it provides a process for making a thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having the least variation in its characteristics. A thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having a further increased mobility can be produced if the temperature of the substrate is held in the initial stage of vacuum deposition to be at a level lower than the limiting temperature of the substrate given by the formula 1 TL 9.98 x 10 4 5.66 x 10 5 logP 3 wherein TL is the limiting temperature of the substrate on the absolute scale, and P is the pressure in the vacuum deposition system èxpressed in Torrs . The term initial stage used herein means the initial period until the film having a thickness of about 1,000 is formed. When the final film having a relatively large thickness Ce.g., 2 p or more is desired, it is preferred that the initial stage be extended to form the film having a thickness of about 2,000 . As described hereinafter, the limiting substrate temperature TL given by the formula 3 corresponds to the decomposition point of the crystal of an indium antimony compound, and according to the studies of the present inventors, the substrate temperature is desirable held in the initial stage of vacuum deposition at a level at least 200C lower than this decomposition point. When a thin film is formed by vacuum deposition, the substrate temperature becomes higher than the preset level, and even in such a case, the substrate tempera ture must be held below the melting point of the In Sb compound which is about 530 C. For this purpose, the substrate temperature may be increased continuously at a given rate, or it may be elevated incrementally step wise .As indicated by the formula 3 , the limiting temperature of the substrate is dependent on the pressure, and it is a temperature at which the amounts of deposition of indium and antimony vapors are decreased suddenly for the unit amount of vaporization the amounts of indium and antimony vaporized from their boats per given area. Therefore, the limiting substrate temperature can be defined as the temperature of the substrate at which the ratio of deposition to vaporization is decreased suddenly for a given degree of vacuum. The present inventors studied the relation between the limiting substrate temperature and the pressure, and obtained the results shown in Figure 4, wherein the logarithm of pressure is plotted on the yaxis and the reciprocal of the substrate temperature is plotted on the x axis. In Figure 4, the straight line 1 is the theoretical decomposition line given by the formula 3 , and the numerals 2, 2 and 2 represent sets of experimental values that were obtained at different pressures. One can easily see that these experimental values are virtually on the theoretical decomposition line.The present inventors have found that these values well coincide with the theoretical curve of the decomposition of an indium antimony compound that is very similar to the formula C3 and which is calculated on the basis of the thermal data for In Sb compound prepared by tichter et al see Trans. Metallurgical Soc., AIME Vol. 245, p. 99, 1969 and the thermal data for the elements prepared by Stull et al Csee ThermodynamicProperties of the Elements, ACS, 1956 . In other words, for a given degree of vacuum in the vacuum deposition system, the limiting substrate temperature substantially corresponds to the decomposition point.Therefore, the process of this embodiment differs essentially from the three temperature method proposed by Anther. In the three temperature method, AIn ASb is held at 1.0 1 or below, and, at the same time, the substrate temperature must be held higher than the decomposition point of theIn Sb compound, but in the process of this embodiment, A n Sb is held between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1, and at the same time the substrate temperature in the initial period of vacuum deposition is held below the decomposition point of the In Sb compound.If the vapors of indium and antimony are deposited on the substrate at an AIn ASb between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1 by presetting the substrate temperature higher than the decomposition point of the In Sb compound semiconductor, a non glossy and nonuniform film having pinholes results, and, what is worse, the mobility, which is an important factor of the result ing film, is only 10,000 cm2 V sec or less. Formula 3 also indicates that the limiting temperature of the substrate can be varied by changing the degree of vacuum. To be more specific, the degree of vacuum may be reduced if the substrate temperature need be preset at a high level. The degree of vacuum may be reduced by holding down the performance of the evacuating system used, or by introducing a gas into the vacuum deposition system through a needle valve or the like. Nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium and many other gases can be used, but according to the studies of the present inventors, a thin film having a remarkably high mobility can preferably be obtained by using nitrogen. The inventors therefore conducted a close study on the gas to be introduced in the vacuum deposition system, and found the following 1 rare gases such as argon and helium decrease, rather than increase, the mobility 2 if nitrogen is supplied in an amount that is greater than its content in atmosphere, higher mobility is obtained. The amount of nitrogen relative to other gases varies with the degree of vacuum achieved at the start of vacuum deposition and that achieved by introduction of nitrogen. For instance, if the initial degree of vacuum which is 10 6 Torr is reduced to 5 x 10 6 Torr by supplying nitrogen, the nitrogen content is about 90 molt.Surprisingly enough, such a small change in the composition of the atmosphere in the vacuum deposition system from 80 mol of nitrogen that is the nitrogen content of air to 90 mol is sufficient to provide the desired improvement in mobility. In other words, the mobility can be increased significantly by using an atmosphere for vacuum deposition whose nitrogen content is greater than 80 , the nitrogen content of air.But if the nitrogen content is less than 80 mol , the mobility is not improved at all, and it is even decreased depending on the amounts of other gases contained in the vacuum deposition atmosphere. Several methods can be used to increase the nitrogen content of the vacuum deposition atmosphere. In one method, the system is evacuated to an adequately high degree of vacuum, then nitrogen is introduced, and the system is again evacuated to a high degree of vacuum. In another method, a nitrogen supply valve is connected to the vacuum deposition equipment, and the initial degree of vacuum of the system is reduced by supplying a small amount of nitrogen. A preferred method is to first increase the degree of 7 vacuum up to 10 7 Torr, then supply nitrogen to obtain a pressure of 10 Torr, and perform the vacuum deposition with the supply of nitrogen continued. A thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having an even higher mobility can be produced in a nitrogenrich atmosphere by depositing the vapors of indium and antimony on a substrate that is held in the initial stage of the deposition at a level lower than the limiting substrate temperature given by the formula 3 . When it is desired to provide the thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor of the present invention with a mobility as high as that of a bulk device, AIn ASb must be held at 1.0 1 or lower in the initial stage of vacuum deposition and at the same time, the substrate temperature T must be preset at a level that satisfies the relation Tc T Tc 30 4 wherein Tc is the critical temperature of the substrate on the absolute scale that is given by the formula 1 Tc 1.29 x 10 3 3.84 x 10 5 logP 5 wherein P is the pressure in the vacuum deposition system èxpressed in Torrs . The formulae C4 and .5 are empirical formulae that show the relation between the preset temperature of the substrate and the degree of vacuum for producing a thin semiconducting film having a very high mobility.As far as the present inventors know, the formula 5 corresponds to the equilibrium vaporization temperature Tv of Sb4 with a degree of vacuum in the range of from 10 6 to 10 3 Torr. It is believed that the formula slightly differs from, but substantially corresponds to, the value calculated from the thermal data for the elements prepared by Stull et al. Thermodynamic Properties of the Elements, ACS, 1956 . Formula 4 allows some variation in the preset value of the substrate temperature because said value must be varied depending upon the position of the monitor for the substrate temperature or the degree of vacuum, as well as upon the vacuum deposition rate. In this case, the value ofAIn ASb in the initial stage of the vacuum deposition must be held at 1.0 1 or lower.But it is absolutely necessary that the average value of AIn ASb be maintained between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1 throughout the process of vacuum deposition. The particularly preferred average value of A1n ASb is between 1.1 1 and 1.5 1. The studies of the present inventors have shown that it is essential for the purpose of making a thin film of In Sb semiconductor having a vex, high mobility that the value of AIn ASb be held in the initial stage of vacuum deposition to be at 1.0 1 or below. The inventors made a series of experiments in which vacuum deposition was conducted by controlling the power supplied to indium and antimony boats for achieving a mobility as high as that of a bulk device and the deposition was stopped in a few minutes. The inventors found that in every experiment, the value of AIn ASb was 1.0 1 or less, and in an extreme case, the value was less than 0.5 1. However, the requirement of holding the value of AIn ASb to be 1.0 or less applies only to the initial period of vacuum deposition during which a semiconducting film having a thickness of 1,000 A is formed . If the value of AIn ASb is held at 1.0 1 or lower in the subsequent stage, the resulting film is very brittle and has a very low mobility. If the above two requirements for the substrate temperature and AIn ASb are met, a thin film of indiumantimony complex crystalline semiconductor is produced wherein both the crystal of indium antimony compound and the indium crystal have grown to a size visible to the naked eye. If the substrate temperature in the initial stage of vacuum deposition is lower than the critical substrate temperature, the resulting crystal is not visible to the naked eye at all, or only a blue white film is formed. If the substrate temperature is higher than the upper limit specified by the formula 4 , some of the crystal grains formed are visible but there occurs a variation is not only the mobility but also the film thickness, or a transparent area is formed in the film.If vacuum deposition is performed by the process of this embodiment , the resulting thin film of indiumantimony complex crystalline semiconductor has a mobility as high as that of a bulk device and the crystal grains formed are visible to the naked eye. It is very surprising that this film has a value of FIn FSb in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1. The compound semiconductor of the present invention has a high Hall mobility and is very suitable for use as the material of a Hall element or magnetoresistive element. In this connection, it should be remembered that the formula 1 shows the desirability of making a thin film of the semiconductor if it is used in a Hall element or magnetoresistive element. For this purpose, the compound semiconductor of the present invention is made in a thin film whose thickness is preferably from 5,000 to 10 pm, more preferably from 0.8 to 5.0 pm. The thinner the film, the greater the output voltage produced, but, on the other hand, an excessively thin film has low mobility. According to the process of the present inven tion, a thin film of high mobility indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having a value of FIn FSb of from 1.1 1 and 1.7 1 can be produced by depositing the vapors of indium and antimony on a substrate under such conditions that the value of AIn ASb is held in the range from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1. This method is advantageous in that it can be performed on an industrial scale such more easily than the conventional method of making an indium antimony crystalline compound having anAIn ASb of 1.0 1, and that it is capable of producing a thin semiconducting film that has high mobility and which yet has a very small variation in the composition and characteristics of the film. There is no particular limitation on the substrate that can be used in the process of the present invention, but an electrically insulating substrate is preferred, and an insulating crystalline subs trate is particularly preferred. Illustrative substrates include silica glass, borosilicate glass, sodium glass, sapphire, calcium fluoride, sodium chloride and mica, and sapphire, calcium fluoride, sodium chloride and mica are particularly preferred. Mica is advantageous since it is fairly easily available and is completely insulating single crystal that easily forms a cleavage plane with minimum contamination or defect. The process of the present invention can be performed by any of the known techniques that comply with the purposes of the present invention. Suitable examples are vacuum deposition by heating with an electric heater, electron beams, by flash evaporation, sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy and by ion beam plating. The rate of forming a thin film can be selected from a fairly wide range, i.e., from 0.1 to 1,000 A sec, but for easy control of the AIn ASb, the rate of 1 to 10 A sec is particularly advantageous. The substrate may be heated to any temperature if the relation AIn ASb FIn FSb is satisfied, and it is generally heated to 5300C or less.The vapor deposition temperature seems to have some relation with the pressure in the evaporation equipment, and, generally, the lower the pressure, the lower the maximum temperature for vapor deposition. The optimum source of evaporation is elemental indium and antimony.The power supplied to the respective boats may be so controlled that the ratio of evaporation of indium to antimony provides an AIn ASb between 1.1 1 and 1.7 1.Therefore, an antimony containing compound such as InSb or GaSb may be used as an antimony source. Such compounds can be satisfactorily used as an antimony source since the vapor pressure of indium or gallium is much lower than that of antimony. Figure 5 is a schematic representation of an apparatus suitable for use in producing the indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor of the present invention. In Figure 5, the temperature of a substrate e.g., mica plate denoted as 1 is detected by a thermocouple 3 attached to the substrate through an indium material 2, and is held constant by a substrate temperature control system not shown . The substrate 1 is heated to a predetermined temperature by heating elements 5, 5 , and boats 4, 4 are heated to a predetermined temperature by heating elements 6, 6 . The boats 4, 4 are charged with elemental indium and antimony. Thereafter the apparatus is evacuated with a vacuum suction system 7 to a pressure of 10 to 10 Torr.By heating the boats 4, 4 to a higher temperature, the desired thin film of InSb complex crystalline semiconductor is formed on the substrate 1. The thus prepared thin film of InSb complex crystalline semiconductor of the present invention can be fabricated into a semiconductor device such as a Hall element or magnetoresistive element by, optionally pasting or transferring the film onto another substrate such as ferrite, patterning and connection to electrodes. The present invention is now described in greater detail by reference to the following examples and comparative examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit its scope. The electric characteristics of the thin semiconducting films made in the following examples and comparative examples were measured by applying a constant current of 5 mA, a constant voltage of 1 V, and magnetic field of 500 gauss to films that were shaped as shown inFigure 1 Clength 10 mm, width 5 mm . The composition of the crystal grains was analyzed by the wet process of atomic absorption spectroscopy, wherein a predetermined amount of the thin film was dissolved in dilute nitric acid and the light absorbance of the indium and antimony in that solution was measured with an atomic absorption spectroscope Model AA 646 of Shimadzu Seisakusho, Ltd. . In the analysis, calibration curves were depicted using two separate solutions of indium and antimony, and on the basis of those curves, the value of FIn FSb was calculated from the measured values of light absorbance. EXX IPLE 1 Forty eight thin films of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having a thickness between 1.0 and 2.0 pm and varying values of FIn FSb were made by depositing controlled amounts of the vapors of indium 6 N of Furuuchi Chemical Co., Ltd. and antimony 6 N of the same company onto a mica substrate in the apparatus of Figure 5. The substrate temperature was 420 C, the degree of vacuum, 2.0 to 3.0 x 10 6 Torr, and the deposition rate, 1.0 to 3.0 A sec.The electric characteristics and FIn FSb of the respective samples were measured, and the result is shown in Figure 2 as a graph depicting the relation between FIn FSb and Hall mobility fry in cm2 V.sec. As one can see from the graph of Figure 2, a maximum mobility of 20,100 cm2 V.sec was obtained when the FIn FSb was 1.44 1, and the Hall coefficient was 346 cm3 C. In the FIn FSb range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1, the mobility was between 9,500 and 20,100 cm2 V sec, and the Hall coefficient was between 254 and 346 cm3 C. Analysis of each film with an X ray diffractometer showed the presence of two peaks for an indiumantimony compound and elemental indium, and they were found to have high degree of selective orientation.Further, Laue photographs of each film revealed that those having a value of FIn FSb in the range of from 1.1 1 to 1.7 1 had no ring characteristic of polycrystals and hence were found to have high degree of crystalline orientation. But those films which had values of F1 n FSb outside this range had the characteristic ring. This data shows that the semiconductor of the present inven tion formed thin semiconducting films having high crystallinity. EXAMPLE 2 Thin films of indium antimony complex crystal line semiconductor having values 4g FIn FSb in the range of from 1.31 1 to 1.48 1 were prepared as in Example 1 except that the mica substrate was replaced by a glass plate CCorning 7059 . The Hall mobilities of the films were in the range of from 2,700 to 5,500 cm2 V sec. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 Three thin films of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having FIn FSb values of 0.98 1, 1.03 1 and 1.82 1, respectively, were prepared as in Example 1 except that a glass plate CCorning 7059 was used as substrate. The films had the Hall mobilities of 1,200, 1,900 and 1,700 cm2 V sec, respectively. EXAMPLE 3 Seven thin films of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor were prepared by depositing the vapors of indium and antimony Cboth being 6 N ofFuruuchi Chemical Co., Ltd. on a mica substrate in the apparatus of Figure 5 wherein both the substrate and the respective boats were heated with a tungsten heater and the temperature of the substrate was held at 4400C by proportional, integral and differential control. The degree of vacuum in the vapor deposition system was preset at 1.5 x 10 Torr, the boats were charged with the same amounts of indium and antimony for the seven films so that the AIn ASb value was 1.45 1, and the power supplied to the boats was so controlled that the film thickness became 1 micron in 30 minutes.Each film was analyzed for its composition by subjecting part of each film to atomic absorption spectroscopy. The seven films had values of FIn FSb in the range of from 1.42 1 to 1.49 1. There was little variation in the Hall mobility of the seven films the respective values were within the range of from 20,000 to 21,500 cm 3 V sec. Additional three groups of seven thin semiconducting films were prepared as in above except that the amounts of indium and antimony were so changed that the values of AIn ASb were 1.15 1, 1.3 1 and 1.6 1, respectively. The composition analysis and mobility data for the films of the respective groups are indicated in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 AIn ASb FIn FSb Mobility cm2 V.sec 1.15 1 1.10 1 1.20 1 14,700 15,500 1.3 1 1.26 1 1.32 1 17,800 19,200 1.6 1 1.51 1 1.67 1 16,700 18,100 For comparison, thin semiconducting films were prepared by controlling the value of A In ASb to be at 0.9 1 and 1.8 1. As shown in Table 2 below, there was not a high degree of agreement between AIn ASb and FIn FSb, the films had low values of mobility, and there was great variation in the mobility. What is more, the films prepared by controlling the AIn ASb at 0.9 1 were brittle and had high offset voltage.Those which were prepared by controlling the AIn ASb at 1.8 1 were apparently not uniform and even contained at transparent area.

Clearly, the process of the present invention is very effective for use in industrial applications as an immediate advantage, the film composition can be control led by controlling the value of AIn ASb, and as a secondary merit, the process is capable of making a thin semiconducting film whose mobility is sufficiently high for practical purposes and varies little from batch to batch. EXA3IPLES 4 TO 6 Vacuum deposition was effected as in Example 3 except that a sapphire C0001 substrate was used. The sapphire substrate was subjected to the following preliminary treatment its surface was treated with a 9 1 mixture of H2 SO4 and H3PO4 at 800C for 2 hours, then immersed in 1 N KOH, washed with water and dried.Immediately after the preliminary treatment, the substrate was mounted in a vacuum enclosure, and three groups of five thin films of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor were prepared by controlling the value of AIn ASb to be at 1.2 1 Example 4 , 1.4 1 Example 5 and 1.6 1 Èxample 6 , respectively.

Those films prepared by controlling the AIn ASb at 0.95 1 had the mobilities in the range of from 1,700 to 2,800 cm2 V.sec, and those which were prepared by controlling the AIn ASb at 1.8 1 had the mobilities in the range of from 1,000 to 2,500 cm2 V.sec. EXAMPLE 7 A thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having an FIn FSb of 1.54 1 was farmed on a mica substrate as in Example 3. The film was then bonded to a ferrite plate, patterned, connected to electrodes, wire bonded and moded to fabricate 340 Hallelements each measuring 3 mm long and 2.5 mm wide. The output voltages from the Hall elements were measured at a constant current of 5 mA or a constant voltage of l V, and in a magnetic field of 500 gauss. The results were VHi 107.7 5.2 mV, VHio 3.5 j 3.0 mV,VHv 45.8 3.1 mV, and IVHVOI 2.0 1.8 mV.The iVHio and IVHVO I were offset voltages as produced in the absence of magnetic field with a constant current and voltage applied, respectively. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 A thin film of indium antimony complex crystalline semiconductor having an FIn FSb of 1.04 1 was formed on a mica substrate as in Example 3, and Hall elements were fabricated from the film as in Example 7.

A mica substrate was used, and its temperature was detected by a Pt Rh thermocouple positioned 10 mm above each wafer. Another thermocouple was positioned above each wafer but at different heights for controlling the substrate temperature. Since the detected substrate temperature differs from the actual substrate temperature, it was corrected for the value of the stationary holder. The values of the substrate temperature indicated in the following examples are those after correction by this method.
