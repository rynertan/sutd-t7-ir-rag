# Device for sampling expired gases in order to determine the gaseous concentrations.

## Abstract
A device for the sampling and measuring of the concen trations of the gases expired by a person, comprising a mixing chamber 2 whose function, as far as the results are concerned, may be compared to that obtained by varying the capacity of a dynamic chamber, K times bigger, where K F Fc, F being the flow of the gas to be analyzed and Fc being the sampling flow. The sampling pump 4 is always in phase with the ventilation signal, and the sampling flow Fc is always directly proportional to said ventilation flow F according to a factor determined by variable gain amplifier 6 and by power amplifier 5 . When the ventilation signal increases, an integrator circuit 7 controls the gain of stage 6 which allows the proportionality factor K between the ventilation flow F and sampling flow Fc of the pump to be varied. In this way the air volume passing through the mixing chamber 2 will be practically constant, and a functioning will be obtained equivalent to that of a dynamic chamber.
