## Abstract
The system includes an actuation device having a d.c. electric motor 10, 20 and a high ratio gearbox 11 . The output of the gearbox connects with the spool 13 of the valve through a segmented rack and pitman pin or a rack and pinion arrangement 12 . A control circuit for the electric motor incl udes position feed back 17 to permit accurate positioning of the spool. Further, spring means are included to bias the spool to its neutral position in the absence of a control signal or on occurrence of a fail condition.
