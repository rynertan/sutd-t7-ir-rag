# Improved sensing and welding arrangements for manipulator welding apparatus.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a manipulator welding apparatus which comprises a manipulator arm 10, 18 which is con trollable in a plurality of axes and includes a selectively operable hand receiver 20 into which can be fitted either a welding hand 24 or a sensing hand 22 . The welding hand 24 includes a welding torch 92 , and the sensing hand 22 includes a projection unit 50 and an image sensing unit 56 which includes an objective lens 60 and a fibre optic cable 62 for receiving, by reflection from a workpiece, a projected optical slit pattern. The fibre optic cable is con nected to a camera 32 located remotely from the sensing hand 22 when the latter is mounted in the hand receiver 20 . The image received by the camera is utilised by the manipulator apparatus during a sensing step to determine the deviation between the path traversed by the manipula tor during sensing and the actual workpiece path. The de viation is then utilised to calculate the workpiece path data for welding a desired weld seam. To permit ready exchange of the welding hand 24 and the sensing hand 22 relative to the manipulator arm, and also for hand storage purposes, a hand tool station 26 is provided which supports the weld ing hand 24 and the sensing hand 22 when not in use. The hand tool station 26 has a fixture 42 which interfits with the welding hand 24 and a fixture 40 which interfits with the sensing hand 22 .
