# Tape recording or reproducing apparatus with rotating magnetic head.

## Abstract
A helical scan video cassette recorder 1 is provided with a rotary head drum system 13 which is centred on a drive spindle 7 by elastic deformation of one or more wall por tions. In order to obtain an accurately reproducible centring of the head drum system relative to the axis of rotation 6 of the drive spindle, the occurrence of a non reproducible oblique position of the head drum system on the drive spindle is mitigated by centring the head drum system near each of its two sides by means of elastically deformable wall portions 16, 18 . One or both of the centring means provided on oppo site sides of the head drum system may function as a clamp ing means for clamping the head drum system on the spindle as well.
