## Description
The present invention relates to an image reading apparatus for reading images by means of a CCD sensor. Fig. 1 shows a conventional optical system in an image reading apparatus, to which one embodiment of the present invention applies. Referring to Fig. 1, the light from a white colored fluorescent lamp 3 is applied upon a color manuscript 2 with the color manuscript 2 being arranged before a white colored back plate 1. The light from the white colored fluorescent lamp 3, reflected by the color manuscript 2, is reflected by a mirror 4, focused and input to a CCD sensor 6. An image reading apparatus using a CCD sensor 6 as shown in Fig. 1 may be used in a facsimile OCR, a color scanner or the like. In such an image reading apparatus, the white colored fluorescent lamp 3 is disadvantageous in that the radiation level changes due to differences in ambient temperatures or through rises in the guide temperature which is raised by self heating after large amounts of lighting. As a measure to prevent these problems, methods have been adopted which use an automatic gain control circuit AGC circuit or flash the white colored fluorescent lamp to change its lighting width thereby controlling the radiation amount. However, disadvantageously, a proper circuit is not provided which precisely controls a high speed analog signal such as an AGC circuit. A method which varies the lighting width of the white colored fluorescent lamp becomes unstable in lighting when the lighting duty cycle becomes extremely small. From EP A 0 006 570 a document scanning system with exposure control is known in which the light amount reflected from a reference region is detected by certain cells exposure control cells of a CCD sensor while the other cells thereof document information cells receive the light reflected from the document. As soon as the exposure control cells has received a certain light amount the scanning operation for one line is terminated. In this known apparatus, both detection of the light amount and the reading of the document are performed in the same time interval. For this event, the exposure control cells of the CCD sensor must be controlled differently from the document information cells. The layout or design of the CCD sensor must be different in its exposure control section from that in the document information section. Therefore, time control and manufacturing of the CCD sensor of the known apparatus is rather complicated. From EP A 0 071 005 a further system is known in which a linear CCD sensor is used for reading the light of an illuminated area. Since the sensor is limited in its output by saturation of the CCD analog shift register in the sensor, the useable video signal is maximized among other measures by calibrating the sensor relative to its saturation condition. The calibration operation is performed prior to the reading operation with the calibration not being changed during image reading. An adjustment of the output level of the CCD sensor upon variations of luminance of the light source during image reading is not performed in the known apparatus. Accordingly, an essential object of the present invention is to provide an image reading apparatus in which the CCD sensor may output a stable reading signal even if the light source changes in temperature due to heating. In accompolishing the object of the present invention, according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a CCD sensor output adjusting means for adjusting the output level of the CCD sensor upon changes in the output level due to changes in temperature of said light source, in accordance with the CCD sensor output signal corresponding to a reference region read by the CCD sensor, the output adjusting means detecting when said light source has been stabilized. A lighting control means turns on the light source for a time period less than the length of a predetemined scanning time period, in response to a lighting control signal. A timing signal output means outputs first timing signals for a first time period from the beginning of the lighting of said light source until after the output adjusting means has detected stabilization of the light source, and further outputs a second timing signal for a second time period beginning after said light source has been stabilized but prior to the output of the next one of the lighting control signals. Responsive to the timing signal output means a transfer control means transfers the output of the CCD sensor, which was accumulated therein after lapse of the first time period, at the second time period. According to the invention, the output adjusting means adjusts said first time period for the output of the first timing signals or the width of the first timing signals such that the output level of the CCD sensor transferred at the second time period will be controlled to a given level. With this construction, the reflected light from the image is read by the CCD sensor after the first time period after the light source has become stable, in accordance with the output of the CCD sensor corresponding to a reference region, when the light source has been lighted according to a lighting control signal, with one portion of a region, to be read by the CCD sensor, as a referenced region. After the light source has been stabilized the CCD sensor output is provided by transfering the CCD output at a given second time period before the output of the next lighting control signal but after the first time period. This and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Fig. 2, a reference region 11 in front of which the color manuscript 2 does not pass is provided in the white colored back plate 1. The reference region 11 is provided as a reference for adjusting the output of the CCD sensor 6 shown in Fig. 1. The lights from the white colored fluorescent lamp 3 which are reflected by the reference region 11 are input into the CCD sensor 6 through a lens 5. The level of a signal corresponding to the reference region 11, from among the output signals of the CCD sensor 6, is detected by the CCD output adjusting circuit 12 shown in Fig. 3 so that the level is controlled within a constant range. Referring to Fig. 3, the white colored lamp 3 is turned on by a lighting circuit 7 in accordance with a lighting control signal from a control circuit 10. As described hereinabove, the control circuit 10 is adapted to control the level of the CCD output within a constant range in accordance with the output signal of the CCD sensor 6 corresponding to the reference region 11. Also, the control circuit 10 feeds a transfer pulse ø The detailed construction of the image read in portion 8 shown in Fig. 3 will be described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 4. A CCD sensor 81 outputs light electric charges in accordance with the reflected lights from the images. The light electric charges are fed to a transfer gate 82. A transfer pulse ø The operation of an image reading apparatus shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 will be described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, showing the wave form views of each portion of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. A flashing circuit 7 flashes a white colored fluorescent lamp 3 in accordance with a lighting control signal FL to be given from the control circuit 10. The lights from the white colored fluorescent lamp 3 are applied upon the color manuscript 2 and the reference region 11 of the white colored back plate 1. The reflected lights from the images and the reflected lights from the reference region 11 from the white colored fluorescent lamp 3 are detected by the CCD sensor 81. Namely, the light electric charges corresponding to the reflected lights of the images are accumulated upon, e.g. regions S₁ through S The analog shift register 83 transfers the loaded contents to an output buffer 84 in accordance with the clock pulses ø₁, ø₂. The output buffer 84 photoelectrically converts the light electric charges transferred from the analog shift register 83 to output them as the CCD output signal VO. It is to be noted that light electric charges which are sequentially transferred from the analog shift register 83 are reset each time within the output buffer 84 by a reset pulse ø The characteristic aspects of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 6. In one embodiment of the present invention, one scanning period from the initial lighting of the white colored fluorescent lamp 3 to the next lighting thereof is divided among a T In the period S A transfer pulse ø of the CCD sensor 81. A T . Accordingly, in Fig. 6, assume that no drifts in temperature are provided in the radiation output of the white colored fluorescent lamp 3, and the output of the CCD sensor 81, VO The reason why the T of the CCD sensor 81 in the radiation timing is output within the period of T In the above description, the transfer pulse ø Also, in the embodiment of the present invention, explanation has been given about adjustment of the output level degree of the CCD sensor through changes in the temperature of the light source by the white colored fluorescent lamp 3. Explanation may be given about each ray of light of three primary colors of the color image reading apparatus. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, it is so arranged that one portion of a region to be read by a CCD sensor is made to serve as a reference region, in accordance with the output of the CCD sensor corresponding to the reference region, when the light source has been turned on according to a lighting control signal. The reflected lights from the images are read by the CCD sensor at a first timing after the light source has been made stable, and the output of the CCD sensor is transferred at a given second timing from the first timing prior to the output of the next lighting control signal, thus providing the CCD sensor output after the light source has been made stable.
