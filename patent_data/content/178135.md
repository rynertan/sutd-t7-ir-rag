# Impact plating powdered metal on to metallic articles.

## Abstract
A method of impact plating selected metal powders on to metallic articles using powders which are non spherical and are characterised by an elongated, irregular surface which may contain at least one concave portion. Such metal powders are plated onto metal articles having a Rockwell hardness of at least B 40. The method results in metallic articles having a sub stantially uniform coating composed of the impact plated metal powders.
