# Speed independent arbiter switch employing M out of N codes.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an arbiter comprised of two input ports and one output port each input port has N input data lines, and the one output port has N output data lines one circuit in the arbiter selects only one of the two input ports at a time and another circuit in the arbiter passes characters from the selected input port to the output port. Each of the characters is represented by active logic signals on M out of N data lines on the selected input port, with M being at least two and N being greater than M and greater than three.
