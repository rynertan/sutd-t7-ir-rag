# TRANSMISSION THROTTLE PRESSURE REGULATOR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A control system for an automatic power transmission for an automotive vehicle driveline comprising a throttle valve assembly 122 for producing a pressure signal that is related in magnitude to the operator s demand for engine torque, said signal being used to regulate control pressure from a control pressure source and to trigger operation of automatic shift valves that in turn control actuation and release of the transmission clutches and brakes that effect ratio changes, the throttle valve system 122 including a means 184 for effecting an manual adjustment of the operating pressure level for the throttle valve pressure signal thereby making it possible to effect a desired control pres sure operating range and a desired shift point control for the control system.
