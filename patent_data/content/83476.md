# Stripline type power divider combiner with integral resistor.

## Abstract
A high frequency stripline type power divider combiner comprising a patterned metal layer 14 having an input 18 and two output strips 62, 20 , a dielectric substrate 12 , and a resistive material layer 16 interposed between the metal layer and substrate. A portion of the resistive material layer defines a resistive bridge 24 that extends between and resistively in terconnects the output strips, thereby acting as a resistive load for the cancellation of reflected power output signals. The patterned metal layer and resistive bridge are concurrently de fined by standard photolithographic and etching techniques, thereby allowing the simple and accurate fabrication of an inte gral power divider combiner.
