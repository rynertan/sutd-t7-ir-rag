# Cardiopulmonary resuscitator.

## Abstract
A cardiopulmonary rosuscitator 10 comprising a reciprocatabie cardiac compressor means 12 19 for cycli cally compressing a patient s chest and a ventilating means 26, 27, 96 for inflating the patient s lungs to a benign limiting pressure such as between 10 and 60 cm of water over a period encompassing at least one and preferably three cycles of the compressor means. The resuscitator includes ventilator output control means 45, 51, 54 for i preventing retrograde and exhale flow from the patient s lungs during the systolic portion of the cycle of the com pressor means thus providing for a pressure increase in the patient s lungs due to compression of the patient s chest to a level well above that of the limiting pressure, for example to between 75 and 200 cm of water, and ii periodically venting the patient s lungs, for example for two cycles of the compressor means.
