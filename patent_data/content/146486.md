# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING A REFRIGERANT EXPANSION VALVE IN A REFRIGERATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A refrigeration system is disclosed which may have multiple compression and condenser stages, in which an electronic refrigerant expansion valve is controlled by the digital output of a microcomputer which adjust the expansion valve in response to a valve change signal which is a function of a fraction of the deviation of the senses refrigerant super heat from a desired superheat added to a multipl of the com puted rate of change of the refrigerant superheat.
