# Filter assembly with replaceable filter element.

## Abstract
A filter assembly is provided having a filter chamber and a filter element therein that is replaceable without contamination of filtered fluid with unfiltered fluid even though the filter chamber is not emptied of unfiltered fluid comprising, in combination, a filter housing a filter chamber in the housing an inlet for unfiltered fluid and an outlet for filtered fluid in the housing a filter element removably disposed in the filter chamber across the line of fluid flow from the inlet to the outlet so that fluid flow from the inlet to the outlet normally proceeds through the filter a weir spaced from and downstream of the filter element, compelling filtered fluid from the filter flowing towards the outlet to proceed upwardly through the space between the weir and the filter and then by overflow across the weir and a weir follower operatively associated with the base of the filter element and movable along the weir in fluid tight relation to the base and the weir, to carry filtered fluid in the space between the weir and the filter element on the downstream side of the filter element to the top of the weir while a used filter element is being removed, and to displace unfiltered fluid in the filter chamber from contact with the downstream side of a clean filter element while the clean filter element is being installed. The filter assembly is particularly suited for use as a return line filter mounted in a tank.
