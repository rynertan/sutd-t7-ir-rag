# Motor vehicle having modular chassis and body.

## Abstract
A modular structure formed of components which when assembled define the basic chassis of a motor vehicle, to which chassis is attachable a body in a selected configuration to create an automobile of any desired style. The structure consists of identical front and rear cradles joined to opposing ends of a floor tray, on which seating is mounted. Wheel suspension fixtures are bolted to the cradles to support the wheels of the vehicle. Bumpers are attached to the ends of the cradles, the engine being mounted on either cradle. Overlying the floor tray and secured thereto is a safety capsule having door openings, the capsule acting as a truss for the chassis and functioning as the cockpit section of a body which is completed by a front body section secured to the front cradle and a rear body section secured to the rear cradle.
