# Hybrid composite mooring element for deep water offshore structures.

## Abstract
A lightweight, high modulus mooring element for a tension leg platform comprises a plurality of axially intercon nected composite tubular assemblies 22 122 . Each such assembly includes a composite inner member 34 134 formed of a plurality of generally longitudinally oriented fibrous elements, said inner member 34 134 being fixedly mounted under tension within a surrounding metallic tubu lar member 26,126 which is thereby held in compression prestress.
