# HYBRID BLOWING INSULATION

## Abstract
A hybrid fiber glass cellulosic blowing insulation. Fiber glass nodules are blended with cellulosic fibers which have been treated with a flame retardant in proportions ranging from 30 to 70 fiber glass and from 70 to 30 treated cellulosic fibers. Some examples of the hybrid insulation are more effective at insulating and, hence, less costly per square foot to install, than either of their component parts. Further, the insulation of the present invention will not smoulder when exposed to a temperature exceeding 500 F 260 C for a period of six 6 or more hours.
