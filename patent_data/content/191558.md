# Control of viscosity of aqueous drilling fluids.

## Abstract
A derivatized humate is used to control the viscosity of aqueous drilling fluids. It imparts high temperature stability to the drilling fluid when the fluid is exposed to elevated temperatures, and it provides filtrate fluid loss control. The humate is that found in association with certain titanium mineral deposits, and it is derivatized by reaction with a solubilizable source of chromium ions in the presence of a solubilizing agent, whereby a chromium complex is formed. The reaction can be effected over a wide pH range and a pH of about 6 to about 9 is preferred.

## Description
CONTROL OF VISCOSITY OF AQUEOUS DRILLING FLUIDS The present invention relates to a method of controlling the viscosity of an aqueous drilling fluid using certain derivatized humates, and to a method of making the derivatized humates. In drilling wells into subterranean formations, drilling fluids are circulated past a rotary drill bit to remove rock cuttings, lubricate the drill bit and seal the well bore to provide fluid loss control. In deep well bores, relatively high formation temperatures of from about 3000F to about 450OF 149 to 2320C and higher are encountered. These high temperature formations generally cause aqueous drilling fluids to thicken as a result of temperature instability. Thickening of the drilling fluid impedes pumping of the fluid through the well bore and substantially increases the pumping pressures required to circulate the fluid.If, for some reason, drilling operations must be temporarily suspended such as for example during changing of a drill bit, and the drilling fluid is left in a static condition within the well bore, the fluid can thicken such that recirculation cannot be initiated. This high temperature instability thickening of aqueous drilling fluids often is aggravated by the presence of fluid contaminants such as, for example, salt, gypsum, cement, divalent cations from the formation such magnesium and calcium, and anions such as carbonates, sulfates, chlorides and the like. Heretofore, a wide variety of drilling fluid additives have been proposed to stabilize or reduce the viscosity of aqueous drilling fluids. Included in this list are additives such as humates and lignitic materials.Commercially, leonardite has been used to stabilize and thin drilling fluids. Leonardite imparts increased temperature stability to aqueous drilling fluids particularly if the fluid is thinned with a lignosulfonate additive. Ther term leonardite means a coal like substance similar in structure and composition to lignite.It has been considered to be a naturally oxidized lignite.Leonardite is a specific organic material named afterA.G. Leonard who was associated with its identification.Leonardite is primarily mined from the Harmon bed ofBowman County and Divide County in North Dakota, U.S.A.and in and around Alpine, Texas, U.S.A The significant elemental difference between leonardite and lignite is the oxygen content. Leonardite has an oxygen content on the order of 28 to 29 , whereas lignite has a much lower oxygen content of from 19 to 20 , on an ash and moisture free basis. Unfortunately, in common use, leonardite has been often times called a lignite. Thus, those skilled in the drilling arts often describe a viscosity lowering additive as mined lignin or lignite when they actually mean leonardite . Leonardite is preferred over lignite as a viscosity reducing agent in aqueous drilling fluids because of its higher oxygen content and the functional advantages which are apparently related to the higher oxygen content. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,235,727 and 4,311,600 relate to the use of particular humates as thinners for drilling fluids which are found in association with certain titanium mineral deposits. These patents show that a humate having a unique compositional make up, which was different from that of leonardite, would under some conditions impart greater stability to an aqueous drilling fluid than would leonardite. While such materials have found utility as additives for drilling fluids utilized at temperatures up to about 3000F 1490C , such materials have a signify cantly reduced effectiveness at higher temperatures.We have now developed an additive to impart temperature stability and viscosity reduction to an aqueous drilling fluid maintained at elevated temperatures such as in excess of about 3000F 1490C as well as at lower temperatures, and exhibit tolerance to high levels of contamination. The invention is based on the surprising discovery that a certain derivatized humate, formed from humate found in association with certain titanium mineral deposits, will function as an additive in an aqueous drilling fluid to control the viscosity of the fluid, impart high temperature stability to the fluid and provide filtrate fluid loss control. In particular, the derivatized humate is formed by reacting the humate with a solubilizable source of chromium ions, such as sodium dichromate, whereby a derivatized chromium complex is formed. The reaction can be effected at temperatures of from about ambient to above the atmospheric boiling temperature of the solubilizing agent. The reaction can be effected at substantially any pH, but neutral to slightly alkaline conditions have been found to impart certain advantages as will be described more fully hereinafter. The viscosity of an aqueous drilling fluid can thus be reduced or controlled by dispersing therein a quantity of the derivatized humate sufficient to achieve the desired viscosity effect. Also, filtrate fluid loss control can be achieved by dispersing a fluid loss controlling proportion of the derivatized humate in the aqueous drilling fluid. Aqueous drilling fluids or muds are wellknown aqueous suspensions commonly referred to as drilling muds or more simply as muds . Depending on the salinity of the water phase, they may be further described as fresh water muds or salt water muds .The suspended solids portions of the fluids are primarily clays and barite. Contaminants such as drilled solids, anhydrite, gypsum, dolomite, limestone, sand and salts also may be present. Hydrophilic chemicals, in either solid or liquid form, may be added to adjust and control viscosity, gelation, lubrication, filtration, corrosion, contamination, water loss, and the like. Portions of oils such as petroleum distillates and other hydrophobic chemicals also may be added to impart desirable properties to the drilling mud. Desirably, to promote pumpability and flow characteristics, the viscosity of the drilling fluid is held to near the minimum consistent with suspending the weighting agents, cleaning the hole and maintaining well bore stability.Viscosity reduction or thinning can occur by reducing the apparent viscosity, the plastic viscosity, the yield point, the rate and degree of gelation or any combination of these factors. In the present invention, viscosity and fluid flow properties are altered to or maintained at desired values by the addition of a particular derivatized humate, with consequent advantages of better fluid stability and fluid flow properties at high fluid temperatures. Many of the known aqueous drilling fluids may be thinned advantageously by the method of the invention. The humates employed in the invention are naturally occurring compositions of matter found in association with titanium mineral deposits such as rutile sand deposits. Rutile sand deposits are found in several places throughout the world. In the UnitedStates, rutile sand deposits are located in Florida,Georgia and South Carolina. The rutile sands are in a formation commonly referred to as hard pan . The hard pan comprises rutile sands bound together by a coating of humate. It is this humate which is employed in the present invention. The term humate as used herein refers to the products of natural flocculation or precipitation in sand deposits, of humic substances that were derived from natural leaching of decaying plant and animal material humus . The humate employed in the method and compositions of the invention is generally found in association with titanium mineral deposits and contains humic substances or acids which may contribute to the reduction of the viscosity of drilling muds. When we refer to a humate in association with or associated with, titanium mineral deposits, we mean a humate initially found in association with titanium mineral deposits and at least partially separated therefrom for use in the method of the present invention. Titanium mineral deposits include for example, ilmenite and rutile sand deposits. The term humic acid has been widely applied to acidic solids obtained from plant decomposition. More recently, humic acids have been regarded as the intermediate product or products in the conversion of lignin and other plant materials to hard coal. It is believed that, in the decomposition of vegetable matter, that portion of the cell wall material consisting largely of lignin is converted into humus. In time, the humus may be converted progressively to peat, brown coal, bituminuous coal and finally into anthracite. More usually, humic substance is applied as a generic term for the organic acids derived from humus or the top layer of the soil, containing organic decomposition products of vegetation and animal organisms in admixture with inorganic compounds, sands, minerals, metal hydroxide bases, and the like.The chemical structure of the humic acids has not been established, but they are believed to be large, condensed ring, polymer like molecules containing pendant carboxylic and phenolic groups. The desired humate may be separated from the rutile sand deposits by first breaking up the deposit or formation of hard pan into a ground ore of a convenient size for handling. Much of the humate in the ground ore can be washed off with water to effect the desired separation. Additional humate can be obtained by washing the concentrated ore with aqueous sodium hydroxide.The aqueous mixture containing the free humates may be treated with, for example, a strong mineral acid such as sulfuric acid or alum to regain the natural pH of the humate and facilitate settling out of the suspended humate. The humate is unique compositionally and differs significantly from leonardite in compositional make up as indicated in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,235,727 and 4,311,600, to which reference should be made for further details. In general, the humates employed in the method of the present invention preferably have compositional make ups which provide a carbon to hydrogen ratio weight to weight of from about 9.5 to about 17.5 1.0 a carbon to oxygen ratio of about 1.0 to about 2.3 1.0 an aluminum content of about 2.8 to about 8.4 percent by weight, a titanium content of about 0.5 to about 3.5 percent by weight and a calcium content of less than about 0.5 percent by weight. In order to make the derivative, the separated humate which generally comprises a slurry or sludgelike mixture containing from about 10 to about 40 percent humate solids, is introduced into a reaction vessel wherein a solubilizing agent is also introduced in an amount sufficient to form a mixable slurry with the humate. The solubilizing agent advantageously comprises water, but substantially any other fluid which does not adversely react with the humate, and is capable of solubilizing the source of chromate ions may be utilized. A source of solubilizable chromium ions then is introduced into the reaction vessel to contact and admix with the humate. The source of chromium ions may be introduced as a solid or in a fluid form such as a concentrated solution. The particular form of the chromium ion source is not believed to affect the operability of the present invention. The source of chromium ions can comprise substantially any source of solubilizable chromium, for example, chromate and dichromate salts of monovalent and divalent metals or transition metals and the like. Such compounds can comprise, for example, sodium or potassium chromate or dichromate, calcium or magnesium chromate or dichromate, mixtures thereof or the like.A surprising fact we have discovered is that humate can be derivatized to form an organo chromium complex by reaction of the humate and a chromium ion source, and that the complex so formed contains substantially no chromium in the hexavalent state. If the chromium ions in the source are in the hexavalent state, portions of the hexavalent ions are reduced during the complexing reaction to the environmentally more acceptable trivalent state as a constituent of the derivatized composition. The source of chromium ions is mixed with the humate in an amount sufficient to provide a chromium content of from about 1 2 to in excess of about 15 percent by weight of the derivatized composition on a moisture free basis. It is to be understood that larger quantities of the chromium ions may be present, but current economics and the per formance characteristics of the composition make the lower concentrations desirable. Preferably, the derivatized composition has a chromium content of from about 1 to about 10 percent by weight and most preferably, of from about 2 to about 5 percent by weight of the composition on a moisturefree basis. The reaction can be effected over a wide pH range.The reaction can be effected at the natural pH of the humate, which is about pH 3.5, to a pH of about 13. It has been discovered that performance of the derivatization reaction at a pH of from about 5 to about 10 and, preferably from about 6 to about 9, appears to facilitate in some way the derivatization reaction. The pH of the humate containing slurry in the reaction vessel can be adjusted with substantially any alkaline agent. Preferably, an alkali or alkaline earth oxide, or hydroxide, is utilized as the alkaline agent when pH adjustment is desired. The alkaline agent generally can be added as a solid or as a fluid, such as an aqueous solution, without variation in its effectiveness. When a small quantity of an alkaline agent such as mentioned above is admixed with the humate containing slurry, the humate material is caused to substantially dissolve or form a solution or dispersion which substantially facilitates handling of the humate material and its treatment during the reaction. Generally, in excess of about 85 percent of the solids in the humate containing slurry will dissolve upon addition of the alkaline agent and very often in excess of about 95 percent will dissolve. The reaction between the humate and the solubilized source of chromium ions is effected over a period of a few minutes to in excess of over 24 hours. Preferably, the constituents are maintained under reaction conditions for from about 5 minutes to about 12 hours and, most preferably, from about 15 minutes to about 4 hours. The greater the quantity of chromium ions that are to be complexed with the humate, the greater the reaction time necessary to effect a substantially complete reaction between the constituents. The reaction can be effected under substantially any time period, however, and derivatization of at least a portion of the humate present in the reaction vessel will occur. The presence of uncomplexed chromium ions in the final reacted product appears to have no detrimental effects upon the usefulness of the additive in drilling fluids. The derivatization reaction can be effected at substantially any temperature, such as, for example, from about ambient temperature to a temperature in excess of the atmospheric pressure boiling point of the solubilizing agent. Performance of the reaction at a temperature in excess of the atmospheric pressure boiling point requires the reaction to be performed at above atmospheric pressure whereby the solubilizing agent is maintained in a liquid condition. It has been discovered that when the reaction is effected at an elevated temperature, the reaction will progress at a faster rate toward complete conversion than at lower temperature levels. The reaction temperature, preferably, is maintained at a level below the decomposition temperature of the reactants.However, for ease of preparation, and economic considerations, reaction conditions of from about 600F to about 300OF. 150 to 1490C are preferred. The derivatized humate is removed from the reaction vessel in solubilized form and then, for handling convenience, may be dried by any conventional means such as, for example, solarization or by spray drying or the like.The dried derivatized humate composition of the present invention has been found to be a free flowing particulate when produced by spray drying or ground to desired particle size below about 10 mesh U.S. sieve 2.Omm aperture . The composition may have some moisture content and still remain a freeflowing solid. Normally, the composition will be dried to a moisture content of from about 1 to about 40 percent and, preferably, to a moisture content of from about 5 to about 25 percent. The dried product, then, may be packaged in containers to further facilitate handling. The method of the invention is carried out by dispersing the derivatised humate in a viscosity reducing or controlling proportion in an aqueous drilling fluid, such as an aqueous suspension of a clay material which may, if desired, also contain a weighting agent, such as barite. Filtrate fluid loss control likewise is achieved by dispersing a fluid loss controlling proportion of the derivatized humate in an aqueous drilling fluid. Dispersion or dissolution may be carried out employing conventional mixing and agitating equipment employed conventionally for dispersing additives in drilling mud compositions. The proportion of derivatized humate dispersed in the drilling mud may be varied over a wide range, that is, from about 0.05 to in excess of about 108 weight by volume of the drilling fluid.The derivatized humate dissolves or disperses upon admixing with the drilling mud to form a high temperature stable drilling fluid suitable for use in well bores having temperatures in excess of 3000F. 1490C . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that specific proportions employed may depend upon conditions encountered in the drilling of the well and may be varied. For example, as the drilling of the bore or well progresses and becomes deeper, temperatures in the well will increase, requiring different proportions of the additive.Further, if the drilling fluid becomes contaminated during drilling of the well, more additive may be required to counteract the effects of the contamination. Clearly, the specific proportion of additive may be varied over a wide range depending upon the drilling conditions. It can be stated however that normally the proportion will be within the range of from about 0.5 to about 25 pounds per barrel ppb 1.4 to 70 kg m3 , preferably, from about 1 to about 20 ppb 2.8 to 56 kg m3 and, most preferably, from about 5 to about 20 ppb 14.0 to 56 kg m3 of drilling fluid.The term barrel as used herein refers to a barrel of 42 standard U.S. gallons 159 dm3 . It also will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the derivatization reaction hereinbefore described can be effected in situ in a drilling fluid.In this embodiment of the invention, the humate separated from association with titanium mineral deposits is admixed in an appropriate amount as previously described with a drilling fluid together with a solubilizable source of chromium ions. The chromium ion source then reacts with the humate in the drilling fluid to form the derivatized humate of the present invention. It is to be understood that this method is less desirable than that previously described because a portion of the chromium ions admixed with the drilling fluid will be lost to the clays which are present in the fluid and the like necessitating the use of larger quantities of the chromium ion source to obtain a desired chromium content in the derivatized humate and because of environmental problems associated with additions of hexavalent chromium to drilling fluids. Although we do not wish to be bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that the compositional difference of the derivatized humate of the present invention over leonardite accounts for the functional advantages associated with the compositions of the present invention, in comparison to underivatized humate, leonardite, lignosulfonates or chromium lignite chromium derivatives of leonardite as a drilling mud thinner. The relatively high content of aluminium and titanium suggest that the chemical make up of the humate employed in the method of the invention may include chromium complexed with organotitanium and organoaluminum compounds which may exert some beneficial effect when present in drilling muds. The following Examples illustrate the invention and are given by way of illustration only. The physical test data presented were obtained using procedures specified by API American Petroleum Institute RP 13B, Standard Procedure for Testing DrillingFluids . A fann viscometer Model No. 35A was used to determine the apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, yield point, 10 second gel strength and 10 minute gel strengths. Commercailly available drilling mud testing equipment was used for the API filtrate and high temperature high pressure filtrate determinations. The amounts of additives in the Examples are on a moisturefree basis. In the Examples, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a graphical illustration of the thermal stability of the compositions of the present invention as determined by Thermal Gravimetric Analysis in a nitrogen atmosphere in comparison to other commercial products. Figure 2 is a graphical illustration of the results of tests conducted upon the composition of the present invention in a high temperature and pressure consistometer. Example I Laboratory Preparation of Chromium Derivative of Humate at Elevated Temperature Conditions Fifty 50 grams of humate slurry 20 25 solids, dry basis were diluted with fifty 50 milliliters of deionized water. The mixture was then stirred with a Hamilton Beach mixer at low speed for approximately 30 minutes to form a homogeneous humate slurry. The homogeneous slurry was then transferred to a magnetic type stirrer. If caustic soda addition was necessary, sufficient 1 Normal sodium hydroxide then was admixed with the slurry to adjust the pH to any desired level. After the pH was adjusted, the appropriate amount of a suitable chromium source was added sodium dichromate Na2Cr207 2H20 was used for these syntheses . The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to the initially adjusted pH with 1 N sodium hydroxide.The mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes. The preceding admix tures were p pared in glass containers. The stirred mixture, then was transferred to a metal or glass lined pressure cell and pressurized to approximately 300 pounds per square inch 2.1spa with nitrogen. The cell then was static aged at 3000F. 149 C for 16 hours. Thereafter, the cell was cooled to ambient temperature, and the pressure released.The sample was transferred to an appropriate glass container and then dried to constant weight in a drying oven. The dried sample, then was ground to a particle size less than 10 mesh. To determine if any chromium was being leached from the cell, some of the reactions were carried out in glasslined pressure cells. Reactions were also performed without pH adjustment. The dried products were analyzed for total chromium content and for hexavalent chromium. The difference between the total chromium content and the hexavalent chromium is considered to equal the trivalent chromium content of the derivatized humate reaction product. The results for the syntheses are summarized in Table 1 below.

Example II Laboratory Preparation of Chromium Derivative of Humate at Low Temperature Reaction Conditions Fifty 50 grams of humate slurry 20 25 solids, dry basis were diluted with fifty 50 milliliters of deionized water. The mixture was then stirred with a Hamilton Beach mixer at low speed for approximately 30 minutes to form a homogeneous humate slurry. If caustic soda addition was necessary, sufficient 1 N sodium hydroxide then was admixed with the slurry to adjust the pH to any desired level. After the pH was adjusted, the appropriate amount of a suitable chromium source was added sodium dichromate Na2Cr207 2H2o was used for these syntheses . The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to the initially adjusted pH with an additional quantity of 1 N sodium hydroxide.The mixture was then stirred for 20 minutes, transferred to a drying oven and dried to constant weight. The dried product then was ground to a particle size less than 10 mesh. The dried ground product was analyzed for total chromium and hexavalent chromium. The results for the syntheses are summarized in Table 2 below.

The elevated temperature syntheses and extended reaction times permitted almost 100 reduction of the chromium ion source to trivalent chromium.At ambient temperature, the hexavalent chromium concentration increased as the amount of derivatizing additive was increased. The pH appears to have a more pronounced effect upon the derivatization reaction at low temperatures than at elevated temperatures. A pH level of about 7 appears to facilitate reduction to trivalent chromium. Example III Determination of Operable pB Ranqe The syntheses in Example II were repeated at various pH conditions to determine the operable pH range of the derivatization reaction. The results for the syntheses are summarized in Table 3 below.

At 10 chromium addition, a pH of about 6 7 appears to result in a higher percentage of conversion than at higher or lower pE conditions. Example IV To illustrate the utility of the composition of the present invention, the following tests were performed. An unweighted base mud was prepared as follows The base mud formulation was Equivalent concentration, ppb kg m 14.54 liters distilled water 36.14 g sodium chloride 0.87 2.4 72.70 g calcium carbonate 1.75 4.9 415.45 g Dixie Bond clay 10.00 28.0 1038.63 g IMC0 Gel additive 25.00 70.0 872.45 g IMC0 Klay additive 21.00 58.8The salt and calcium carbonate were added to the water and stirred with a suitable stirrer at about 300 1000 rpm for about 20 minutes.

The base mud was rehomogenized by stirring before portions were taken for treatment with additives in the following procedure A portion of the base mud prepared as above was charged to each of five appropriate mixing vessels, identi fied by the symbols A through E. No additive was admixed with the fluid in Vessel A which serves as a control. ToVessel B, there was added a commercial North Dakota leonardite drilling mud additive. To Vessel C there was added humate obtained from the rutile sand deposits in the vicinity of Green Cove Springs, Florida. To Vessel D was added a commercial chrome lignite sold by Magcobar under the trademark XP 20. To Vessel E is added the derivatized humate of the present invention. The derivatized humate had a calculated chromium content of about 5.3 by weight of moisture free solids. Each sample of the base mud was stirred in a standard Hamilton Beach mixer for approximately 10 minutes.

The sample containing the composition of the present invention decreased the gel strengths and yield point dramatically after hot rolling and static aging.Clearly, the performance of the composition of the present invention is superior to the available conventional additives. The results set forth in Tables 4 and 5 clearly illustrate the beneficial results derived from use of the composition of the present invention as an additive in a drilling fluid in comparison to other conventional additives. More specifically, the composition of the present invention results in superior performance in reducing the yield point and gel strengths.

The physical properties of the control sample indicate it has experienced temperature related thickening. The effectiveness of the composition of the present invention is clearly demonstrated by the decreased values of the physical properties resulting from treatment with only 1 ppb 2.8 kg m3 of the derivatized humate additive. Hot rolling the sample containing the composition of the present invention resulted in little change in the values of the rheological properties of the sample from the initial values.This result demonstrates that the additive is immediately effective and is not dependent upon reaction time with the drilling fluid or fluid temperature to produce the desired effects upon the physical properties of the drilling fluid. The drilling fluid sample treated withXP 20 improved the rheological properties of the sample when compared to the control but did not improve those properties as well as an equal quantity of the composition of the present invention. It should be noted that the derivatized composition of the invention in the case of this example contained only 18 chromium which is less than one half the chromium content of the XP 20. Such results clearly illustrate the superiority of the chromium derivative of the present invention. EXAMPLE VI To illustrate the thermal stability of the composition of the present invention in comparison to other conventional products, thermal gravimetric analyses of several of the compounds were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere to simulate downhole conditions. The analyses were performed using a Du Pont Instrument, Model 1090 ThermalAnalyzer in accordance with the operating manual for the equipment. The results are set forth in Figure 1. The figure clearly illustrates the greater thermal stability of the derivatized product of the present invention in comparison to underivatized humate, chromium lignosulfonate and chromium lignite XP 20 . Example VII To illustrate the stability of the composition of the present invention to cyclic temperature variation which would simulate actual operating conditions of a drilling fluid, the following tests were performed. A sample of drilling fluid was admixed with a quantity of the derivatized humate sufficient to provide a concentration of about 10 ppb 28.4 kg m3 . The sample then was placed in a Fann consistometer. The Fann Instruments Consistometer Model 5S TDL is designed to test drilling fluids under elevated temperature and high pressures such as are encountered in deep drilling. After the fluid is placed in the test chamber, the initial hydraulic pressure is set to 1000 psi 6.9 MPa . Pressure increases significantly as temperature is increased during a test. In the performance of a test, the thickness of the fluid sample is initially determined at ambient temperature under the initial confining hydraulic pressure. The instrument presents data as consistency units c.u. . The higher the c.u. value, the thicker the fluid. Generally, in testing aqueous drilling fluids, the sample is heated to about 3000F, 149 C , while observing the changing c.u. values with time and temperature. As field data had shown that the test fluid to be employed in the present test was unstable at 400OF 2040C , this was selected as the test temperature to evaluate the effects bf the chromium derivative of the present invention in comparison to chromium lignite XP 20 . Data are shown inFigure 2 and Table 7. The drilling fluid sample was received from a deep well in southern Mississippi. At that point in the drilling of the well, bottom hole temperatures were near 4000F 2040C . The rheological properties of the fluid sample received in the laboratory from the well were as follows after 5 dilution with deionized water and 1 ppb 2.8 kg s3 NaOH addition.

To one portion, 10 ppb 28.4 kg m3 of the derivatized humate of the present invention containing about 3 Cr was added.Another portion was prepared with 10 ppb 28.4 kg m3 of the commercially available chromium lignite XP 20 . A third portion was prepared as a control, with no additive. Each was hot rolled for 16 hours at 1500F 660C before testing. Each sample then was placed in the Fann consistometer gradually heated to about 2000F 930C , then to about 3000F 1490C , 350OF 1770C and 4000F 2040C . Sufficient time was allowed at each temperature for the fluid to stabilize, or to demonstrate any temperature instability. To demonstrate the stability or instability of each test sample, the test was divided into two temperature cycles.First, the sample was briefly exposed to a temperature of 4000F 2040C , cooled to ambient temperature, and then reheated in a second heating cycle to a temperature of about 4000F 2040C . The first cycle simulates a single circulation of a fluid through a well with a bottom hole temperature BHT of 4000F 2040C or more, under common drilling conditions.The second cycle demonstrates the behavior of each fluid on repeated and prolonged exposure to temperatures about 3000F 1490C , and particularly to 4000F 2040C .The extended period at 4000F 2040C might represent, for example, a time when fluid is not circulated in the well bore due to an equipment failure.

As the field mud sample was cooled from 3450F 1740C to 2500F 1210C and then further to ambient temperature, it remained too viscous for the consistometer to measure the consistency. This phenomenon is generally referred in a fluid as gelling up or locking up . The sample containing the chromium derivatized humate of the present invention had an initial reading on the Fann consistometer of 114 c.u. As the sample was heated over a period of about eight hours, its consistency regularly decreased until a temperature of about 3700F 1880C was attained. Between 3700F 1880C and 400OF 2040C , a very minor increase in consistency was observed, with the fluid going from 71 c.u. at 3500F 1770C to a maximum of 77 c.u. after 15 minutes at 4000F 2040C . The sample then was cooled to ambient temperature, at which it had a consistency value of only 108 c.u., which is close to its original consistency.This property of the treated fluid is desirable. During the second heating cycle, a decrease in c.u. values occurred through a temperature of 3000F 1490C . At 3500F 1770C , the value had increased only to 74 c.u. The sample temperature was held constant at 4000F 2040C for one hour, to observe the fluid for evidence of progressive thickening. The sample went from an initial value of 89 c.u. to 105 c.u. during the test period. As the fluid sample cooled from the second heating cycle, the consistency values initially decreased, and then stabilized at a value near to its original consistency as it returned to ambient temperature conditions. By way of contrast, the sample treated with XP 20 demonstrated an increase in consistency above that displayed at ambient temperature by the time it reached 375OF 191 C . During the first test period at 4000F 2040C , its consistency was significantly greater than that at ambient temperature. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, the fluid exhibited continued high c.u. values. During the second test at 4000F 2040C , the consistency of the sample increased still further, and very rapidly, to more than twice the original consistency. The higher c.u. readings under downhole temperature conditions demonstrate the instability of the XP 20 treated sample. By way of contrast, the sample treated with the composition of the present invention performed satisfactorily under these conditions. Example VIII To further illustrate the effectiveness of the composition of the present invention, an additional quantity of the fluid mud used in Example 7 was separated into several samples and quantities of the hereinafter identified additives were admixed at about 10 ppb 28.4 kg m3 . The physical properties then were determined as set forth in Example IV.The results are summarized in Table 8.

More specifically, the composition of the present invention results in improvements of various properties of the fluid especially after hot rolling and static aging. After hot rolling, the 10 minute gel strength of the sample treated with the composition of the present invention was significantly less than either that of the chromium lignosulfonate and that of the control. The API filtrate volumes, as well as the HTHP filtrate volumes of the hot rolled samples and the static aged samples, were all controlled more effectively by the composition of the present invention than by the commercial chromium lignosulfonate. The values obtained for shear strengths also demonstrated the superiority of the composition of the present invention to the chromium lignosulfonate. The shear strength of the sample treated with the composition of the present invention, was half that of the control sample while the chromium lignosulfonate treated sample was more than twice the value of the control sample. Low shear strength values are highly desirable for various drilling operations, such as logging, or for reestablishing circulation after downtime. Example IX To illustrate the capabilities of the composition of the present invention in stabilizing salt contaminated drilling fluids, the following tests were performed. A low solids, nondispersed mud from the field was contaminated with 35 pounds per barrel 99 kg m3 of sodium chloride. The sodium chloride concentration of 35 ppb 99 kg m3 is quite extreme and is in excess of the levels that normally would be expected to be encountered in actual drilling fluids. The contaminated fluid was separated into samples and the individual samples are admixed with a quantity of the additives hereinafter set forth. The physical properties were determined as previously set forth. The results are set forth in Table 9 below.
