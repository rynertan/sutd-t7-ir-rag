# Stencil making and utilization methods, apparatus and articles.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for preparing a foraminous stencil blank 25 for subsequent selective hardening of first and second individually soluble but jointly hardenable substances 13, 14 thereon impregnate the foraminous stencil blank 25 only with the first substance 13 as between the first and second substances 13, 14 , until such time as selective hardening of the admixed first and second substances on or in the stencil blank is desired. Preferably, the second substance 14 is stored separately from the impregnated stencil blank 13, 25 , and is applied to the impregnated stencil blank for admixture with the first substance 13 only immediately prior to a desired selective hardening of the admixed first and second substances.
