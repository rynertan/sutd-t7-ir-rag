# Dry gas meters.

## Abstract
A gas meter has two diaphragms which move back and forth in chambers 11, 12 , the movements being transmitted through flag rods 15, 16 and a lever drive mechanism to operate valves 19, 20 for the admission of gas to the chambers. The lever drive mechanism comprises a number of members all of acetal resilient plastics material. The connections between the members are of two types, one as at 23 having a post with an enlarged head which may be forced through an opening 45 . The other type as at 44 has a hooked mouth engaging over a post 31 . The arrangement is such that the forces met in use are not such as to tend to disengage the connections. The meter may therefore be assembled quickly and easily.

## Description
Dry Gas Meters.This invention relates to dry gas meters of the kind in which back and forth movements of diaphragms in gas chambers are transmitted from a flag rod through a lever drive mechanism to operate valves for the admission and release of gas from the chambers.The lever drive mechanisms have in the past required skilful assembly work.For instance, as shown in U.K. patent No. 1,165,151, all the items of the mechanism are screwed or bolted together, requiring considerable assembly time. Such mechanisms have usually been made of metal items which lend themselves to screwed or bolted connections.The invention provides a gas meter of the kind in which back and forth movements of diaphragms in gas chambers are transmitted from oscillating flag rods through a lever drive mechanism to operate valves for the admission of gas to the chambers characterized by said lever drive mechanism comprising a plurality of members all of resilient plastics material, which have connections which are releasably secured together by resiliently forcing a post on one member into an opening on another member1 the respective openings and posts all being arranged so that the forces to which they are subjected in use do not tend to disengage the posts from the openings.The advantages of the invention are that the previous metal items of the lever drive mechanisms have been replaced by items of resilient plastics material and the connections of these items have been made quick and easy to make, so reducing the time required for assembly. Moreover, although the items of resilient plastics material would be considered to suffer the disadvantage of being somewhat unsuitable for making screwed connections since the threads tend to strip, this has according to the invention been turned into an advantage, since the forms of connections used have no screw threads but are also more easily made than threaded connections. The possible difficulty that such connections might become easily detached in use has been overcome, since it has been discovered that the forces met in use can be arranged to act in directions not tending to disconnect the connections.A specific embodiment of the invention is shown in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a gas meter of the kind described, with insets of details of various parts, and Figure 2 is a detail of the arrangement of a crank drive mechanism of Figure 1.The meter comprises a pair of gas chambers 11, 12 each divided by a flexible diaphragm, the chambers on each side of the diaphragm being alternately supplied with gas via valve openings in seat 13 . Gas exhausts from the chambers through an exhaust tube 14 , carried on a plate 14 secured to seat 13 .Each diaphragm carries a flag rod connector not shown for instance of the kind described in our U.K. patent application No. 7920155. Back and forth movements of each diaphragm are translated into oscillating movements of metal flag rods 15, 16 which extend in gas tight manner out of the gas chambers to be connected to a lever drive mechanism. The lever drive mechanism transmits the oscillating movement of the flag rods to valves 19, 20 and to an index not shown .The lever drive mechanism is formed entirely of members made in a resilient plasties xaterial, e.g. acetal. Flag arms 21, 22 are screwed tightly onto the flag rods and are directed downwardly from the flag rods. At their lower ends they carry upwardly directed pins. 23, 24 rover which openings 45 in the ends of crank levers 25, 25 are spring fitted, so allowing the levers to be pivotally attached to the flag arms by simply pushing them over the pins. The pins have their upper ends of ,slightly increased diameter, as shown in the inset, such that the openings in the levers have to be forced over them, the openings then being a loose fit on the lower portion of the pins but retained thereon by the increased diameter upper ends.It will be appreciated that the drive transmitted through the pins tends to produce forces normal to the pin axes, which do not tend to pull the pins out of the openings. They can, however, be dismounted when required by sufficient upward pressure. The crank levers 25, 26 are at their other ends loosely threaded onto a common pivot pin 28 seen best in the inset, which is a spring fit in a tangent member 29 described in more detail in our U.K.patent application No. 7920156, the pin 28 having an increased diameter upper end 28a similar to pins 23, 24 .The tangent member 29 drives a spindle 30 of a gear box 18 , the spindle emerging at the top of the gear box to drive a crank drive 46 having two opposed acetal crank pins 31, 32 . The gear box shaft 39 drives an index not shown for recording the volume of gas measured by the meter.Two acetal valve operating levers 33, 34 each have one end formed with a hooked opening 44 which is a spring fit on one of the crank pins 31, 32 .The open mouth of the hook is slightly smaller than the diameter of the corresponding crank pin, so that it can be forced onto the crank pin by resilient deformation of the hook, bat remains connected until sufficient force is applied to it to disconnect it. The other ends of the levers have downwardly directed pins 40, 41 which are spring fits in openings 35, 36 in the valves 19, 20 , the pit having increased diameter ends like pins 23, 24, 28 . The valves have key hole shaped slots 37, 38 in which engage pins 42, 43 , each pin having a key hole shaped top as seen best in the inset. To mount the valves on the pins, the key holes of the pin heads are aligned with the key hole slots, and passed through the slots. When the heads emerge from the slots, the valves are turned with respect to the pins so that the key holes are no longer aligned and the valves cannot be removed.The positions of the key holes are chosen so that in use the valves never enter the position in which the key holes are aligned and the pins can be withdrawn. However, in deliberate disassembling, the pins 40, 41 can be removed and the valves then swivelled to the position in which the key holes are aligned. The engagement of the pins 42, 43 on the valves affords a pivotal mounting, the valves being reciprocated back and forth in an angle about pins 42, 43 , driven through the levers 33, 34 . In this movement the valve openings in seat 13 are opened and closed in timed relationship. In order to obtain a continuous movement with no dead position, the movement of one diaphragm leads the other. It will therefore be seen that the valves 19, 20 must oscillate out of phase with one another. Each valve as it reaches the end of an oscillation has a brief dwell period when it is effectively stationary. The crank angles of the crank pins 31, 32 are designed with relation to the angles of levers 33, 34 so that the pins are moving in the direction toward the open mouths of the hooks of levers 33, 34 generally during this dwell period, so that there is little or no resistance to the movement of the pins. At all other times of the oscillation the pressure applied by the pins to the levers is contained within the circle of the enclosing hook. By arranging for the moment when the pressure would tend to disengage the hook to coincide with a point at which little or no drive is being transmitted the likelihood of disengagement is much reduced. Figure 2 shows the position when valve 19 is at its bottom most position as seen in the Figure at its stationary point. Crank 46 is positioned so that crank pin 31 would tend to move out of the mouth of hook 44 , if there had been driving pressure between the pin and the lever 33 .
