## Description
BLOCK COPOLYMER HOT MELT ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS, A METHOD OF FILLING A CAVITY THEREWITH, AND A SUBSTRATE WITH A CAVITY FILLED WITH SUCH A COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a hot melt adhesive composition, to a method of filling voids with the adhesive composition and to articles filled or coated with the hot melt adhesive composition. More particularly, it refers to block copolymers containing glass fibers and a. finely divided metal powder, to a method of filling voids with such compositions and to articles, filled or coated with the compositions. Hot melt adhesives are well known in the prior art.These materials are conveniently applied to a substrate in the molten state and upon cooling form an adhesive bond. However.a deficiency common to most of the hot melt adhesives of the prior art is their tendency to soften and flow at elevated temperatures, as, for example, 70 to 1000C. with a resulting loss of bond strength. Ccnsequenly, these materials are not suitable for use over abroad temperature range. Attempts to upgrade the softening and flow temperatures have involved using very high molecular weight resinous materials and or crosslinking of the resin. These methods have resulted in materials with higher softening points and flow temperatures. However, in most cases the resulting material was not adapted to thermal processing because its higher molecular weight and or crosslinked structure engender extremely high application viscosity. Thus, these materials were not suitable for use as hot melt adhesives. In the manufacture and repair of metal bodies such as automobiles and appliances, solder compositions containing lead are frequently used to fill cavities and voids. These lead solders are extremely dense and can add a significant increment to the weight of the metal body. They present a health hazard which mandates special handling to protect workers engaged in the soldering and cavity filling operations.Curable adhesives such as epoxies are generally unsatisfactory for such cavity and void filling applications because they require careful metering of the components to provide good physical properties and bond strength, because they take too long to cure to a sandable state and because they have rather poor weather resistance.Conventional hot melt adhesives are also unsatisfactory for cavity and void filling applications because they cannot be sanded rapidly at assembly line speed, they do not readily accept paint, exhibiting bleed through , and they do not withstand the high temperatures necessary for the subsequent cure of paint overcoats. Bleed through or telegraphing is the term used to describe the revelation of difference in composition of the substrate when it has been painted, caused by a difference in reflectivity between the painted metal and the painted adhesive composition. U.S. Patent 3,650,999 discloses block copolymer comprising hard polyester segments and soft polyamide segments having improved adhesion and high temperature performance obtained by reacting a crystalline polyester, a C18 to C54 polycarboxylic acid and a primary diamine. This poly ester amide in common with other hot melt adhesives has deficiencies in creep resistance at temperatures above 1500C.in the range up to 2050C. and above and in shrinkage when the hot melt is cooled to room temperature after application.These deficiencies have been overcome to a considerable degree by incorporating a metal powder into the block copolymer to yield a cavity filling composition which possesses good sandability and paint acceptance. However, the metal powder copolymer composition can lack adequate impact resistance especially at low temperatures and can sag excessively at elevated temperatures. Attempts to improve the impact resistance by introducing an energy absorbing rubber reinforce ment were generally unsuccessful and added a further complic tion of binding of the sanding disc, making sanding extremely difficult. The present invention is directed to an adhesive composition of improved impact resistance at low temperatures, which is less dense and toxic than lead solder, forms a strong bond to metal and painted metal substrates, withstands extremes of humidity and temperature, has sag resistance at elevated temperatures, is readily trowelled to fill a cavity, sets rapidly to a sandable state, is easily sanded smooth and accepts paint without bleed through . The adhesive composition comprises a block copolymer, aluminum powder, and glass fiber wherein the block copolymer is selected from the group consisting of copolyesters, copolyamides, copoly esteramides and copoy ether esters melting at a temperature of at least about 1500C., having from about 30 to about 70 weight percent of hard segments and from about 70 to about 30 weight percent of soft segments, wherein the weight ratio of block copolymer to aluminum powder and glass fiber is in the range of about 3 7 to about 3 2, wherein the weight ratio of block copolymer to glass fiber is at least about 2 1 and wherein the weight ratio of glass fiber to aluminum powder is at least about 1 9. Another aspect of the invention is directed to substrates coated or filled with the adhesive composition and yet another aspect is directed to a method of filling a cavity in a substrate which comprises applying the adhesive composition as a hot melt to fill the cavity, cooling the adhesive composition below the crystallization temperature of the block copolymer and sanding the adhesive composition to provide a surface even with the surrounding substrate The block copolymer of the adhesive compositions of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of copolyesters, copolyamides, copoly ester amides and copoly ether esters melting at a temperature of at least about 1500C., having hard segments and soft segments to provide a balance of physical properties and processability.These are Considered to exist in microscopic domains within the buik mass of copolymer resin to provide a heterophase system in which the copolymer will have physical properties reflecting the properties which the respective segments would manifest independently. By control of the relative size, proportions, crystallinity and crystal melting points of the segments, the tack, open time and bond strength of the adhesive can be controlled. The hard segments contribute crystalline blocks to the copolymer so that optimum bulk physical properties such as tensile strength and stiffness can be achieved without incurring the disadvantage of high processing viscosity. The hard or crystalline segments can be polyester or polyamide of weight average molecular weight of from about 400 to about 16,000 to ensure that the segment will contribute the optimum ordered structure to the final polymeric product. Polyesters and polyamides with a weight average molecular weight of less than about 400 have a short chain length and cannot contribute the necessary ordered structure to the final polymeric product which also comprises soft segments, Polyesters and polyamides with a weight average molecular weight of greater than about 16,000 may require excessive reaction times or temperatures to form the final block copolymer leading to degradation of the polymer and a subsequent loss in adhesive properties.To ensure that the final polymeric product has excellent thermal properties such as resistance to flow at elevated temperatures the melting point of the hard polyester or polyamide segment should be at least about 1800C, Preferably, the melting point is in the range of from 2000C. to 2700Ct The hard or crystalline polyester segments of the block copolymer are condensed from at least one aliphatic or alicyclic diol having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms selected to give a melting point in the desired range. Representative examples of such acids are terephthali acid, isophthalic acid, hexahydroterephthalic acid, the naphthalic aids, such as 2,6 , 2,7 , 2,8 , 1,5 and 1,4 napSthalene dicarboxylic acids and other such acids which form high melting polyester resins. Examples of glycols are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tetramethylene glyccl, neopentylene glycol, 1,4 cyclohexane diol, 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol and other such glycols. High melting polymers containing components such as 2,2 dimethyipropane diol, form polyesters which have melting points above 2340C. Mixtures of the foregoing polyesters can also be used. Preferably, a polyester from the following group can be used to provide the hard segments of the block copolymer Poly ethylene terephthalate isophthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly ethylene hexamethylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly ethylene neopentylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene terephthalate isophthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene hexamethylene terephthalate 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene neopentylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly ethylene propylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 60 40 and Poly tetramethylene 2,6 naphthalate terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 etc. When the hard polyester segments comprise polyethylene terephthalate, the molecular weight range corresponds to an inherent viscosity range of about 0.05 to about 0.7 determined at 250C. with a solution of 0.5 g 100 ml in a solvent pairconsisting of phenol and sym tetrachloroethane in the weight ratio of 60 40. The hard or crystalline polyamide segments of the block copolymer can be condensed from at least one aliphatic or alicyclic diamine having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic or alicyclic dicarboxylic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms selected to provide a polyamide with a melting point in the desired range. Examples of diamines include ethylene diamine, 1,3 propane 1gamine 1,4 butanediamine, 1,5 pentane diamine, hexamethylene diamine, 1,10decanediamine, cyclohe. snediamine,etc. Examples of acids include oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, and sebacic acids, The hard or crystalline polyamide segments of the block copolymer can be obt2 d b polymerization of U aminocarboxylic acids containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as aminoacetic acid, 3 aminopropionic acid, 4 aminobutyric acid, 6 aminohexoic acid, 10 aminodecanoic acid, etc. Polymerization of lactams such as caProlactam provides a route to several of such polyamides.Among the preferred polyamides are poly hexamethylene adipamide and poly T caprolactam . The soft, amorphous or low melting segments of the block copolymer contribute wettability, elasticity and rubber character to the copolymer. They can be polyester, poly ether ester or polyamide and are generally of weight average molecular weight in the range of about 300 to about 16,000 and possess a glass transition temperature less than about 500C.and more preferably in the range of about 30 to about 400 C. The soft polyester segments of the block copolymer can be condensed from an aliphatic or alicyclic diol having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms and an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms selected to provide a polyester with a glass transition temperature in the desired range. They can be formed by reacting a polylactone diol of number average molecular weight in the range of about 350 to 6000 with an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms.Poly ether ester segments can be prepared by condensing a poly alkylene ether glycol of number average molecular weight in the range of about 350 to 6000 in which the alkylene groups have from 2 to 10 carbon atoms with an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms.Polyamide segments can be prepared by condensing an aliphatic or alicyclic diamine having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms with a mixture of an aliphatic or alicyclic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms and at least 40 weight percent of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 18 to 54 carbon atoms. The block copolymers are prepared by a one step or two step method. In the one step method the components which form the hard or soft segments are polymerized in the presence of a prepolymer of the soft or hard segments respectively. In the two step method the hard segments and soft segments are prepared separately as prepolymers and then condensed together. The preferred block copolymer component of the present invention contains about 30 to about 70 percent by weight of hard segments and conversely about 70 to about 30 percent by weight of soft segments. It is further characterized as having a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 5500 to about 30,000, more preferably in the range of about 8000 to about 20,000 for an optimal balance of physical properties and processability. The melting point of the copolymer com ponent IS above about 150 C. and is preferably in the tempera ture range of about 155 to about 2250 C. for ease of processing without degradation of the copolymer.The glass transition temperature associated with the soft segments of the copolymer is generally less than about 500C. and is preferably in the range of about 30 to 400C. to contribute wettability, elasti city, and rubber character to the copolymer. The melting point and glass transition temperature are conveniently determined with a duPont differential thermal analyzer Model DTA 900 with the scanning calorimeter attachment, employing a 5 to 25 mg sample heated at a rate of 200C. per minute, in a nitrogen atmosphere. The melt viscosity of the copolymer at 2320C. is preferably less than 150,000 centipoise at a shear rate of 4 sec 1 and is preferably in the range of about 25,000 to 100,000 centipoise. The most preferred group of block copolymers are block ccoly ester amides of the type described in U.S. Patent 3,650,999. They comprise hard segments of polyester as described hereinabove, and soft segments of polyamide formed by condensing a C18 to C5 dicarboxylic acid and a C2 to C10 aliphatic or alicyclic primary diamine. The dicarboxylic acids include the dimer acids from dimerization of un saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, e.g., linoleic acid, available commercially as mixtures of monobasic, dibasic and tribasic acids containing up to 10 weight percent of monobasic and tribasic acids. The aliphatic or alicyclic diamines in clude ethylene diamine, 1,3 propane diamine, 1,4 butanediamine, 15 pentane diamine, hexamethylene diamine, l,10 decane diamine, cyclohexanediamine, 2,2 diinethyl 1,3 propane diamine, etc. Optionally up to 60 percent by weight of a linear aliphatic dibasic acid having from 4 to 17 carbon atoms may be substituted for a corresponding amount of the C18 to C54 polycarboxylic acid used to prepare the soft polyamide segments of the polyesteramide. Examples of these acids include oxalic succinic, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic and thapsic acids. The advantage of substituting theC4 to C17 acids for the C18 to C54 acids is to provide a more heterogeneous character to the polyamide segments of the polymez and to modify the glass transition temperature. The second component of the adhesive composition is a finely divided aluminum powder added to improve the creep resistance of the block copolymer and the sandability. It may be of average particle size in the range of about 0.2 micron to about 150 microns and is preferably of average particle size in the range of about 4 to about 50 microns. It is preferred to use an atomized aluminum of generally spheroidal shape parti cularly when the adhesive composition is used for cavity filling since it allows the hot melt composition to be readily smoothed and burnished when it is sanded. In general, platelike, acicular or multi faceted granular aluminum powders are unsatisfactory, surprisingly causing high viscosity in the hot melt and blinding or filling and occlusion of sand paper when the adhesive composition is sanded. In addition to improving the creep resistance and sandability of the adhesive composition, the aluminum powder improves the rate of melting of the adhesive composition, allows the composition to be applied and spread or trowelled more easily with less pressure, imparts longer open time between application of the hot melt and closing of the bond and higher green strength or faster onset of bond strength, and reduces the degree of shrinkage of the adhesive composition when it is cooled from the hot melt temperature to ambient temperature. When the adhesive composition comprises only the block copolymer and the aluminum powder, the impact resistance tends to be low particularly at low temperatures such as 300C. and the molten composition tends to sag at the elevated temperatures at which it is applied. Addition of glass fiber as the third component of the adhesive composi ion improves the impact resistance at low temperatures, reduces the tendency of the adhesive composition to sag at elevated temperatures and permits greater latitude in overcoming shrinkage and minimizing coefficient of expansion differences with the substrate. The glass fiber is of the type conventionally used for reinforcement of thermoplastic resins. It is preferred to use relatively soda free glasses comprising lime aluminum borosilicate glass such as types C and E glass.The glass fiber should preferably be in the form of milled fibers or chopped fibers of average length in the range of about 1 32 inch 0.8 mm to about 1 4 inch 6.4 mm and longer, and of diameter in the range of about 2 to about 20 microns. The preferred average length is in the range of about 1 16 inch 1.6 mm to about 1 4 inch 6,4 mm . The inorganic components of the adhesive composition may optionally be treated with an effective amount of coupling agent by methods well known to those skilled in the art before or while being blended into the block copolymer.. Such coupling agents include organosilane coupling agents exemplified by triethoxy vinylsilane, vinyl methyl dichlorosilane, 2 trimethoxysilyl ethyl methacrylate, 3 amino 1 triethoxysilylpropane, etc. organotitanium coupling agents such as the alkyl alkanoyl titanates exemplified by C1 to C40 alkyl stearyl titanates fatty acids exemplified by oleic and stearic acid fatty amides exemplified by oleamide and stearamide and chromium compounds exemplified by methacrylato chromicchloride.These coupling agents can cause a significant reduction in the melt viscosity of the polymer filler mix, can improve the wetting and dispersion of filler, and can enhance the physical properties of the adhesive composition. The ratio of the three components of the adhesive composition is selected so that the desired balance of adhesion, sag resistance, workability, impact resistance and sandability is achieved. Excessive amounts of glass fiber should be avoided since they contribute to very high melt viscosity, cause poor workability as manifested by the difficulty with which the composition can be spread or trowelled and feathered onto a substrate and decrease the adhesion of the adhesive composition to the substrate.It is therefore, preferred to select the components so that the weight ratio of block copolymer to inorganic components, i.e. to the sum of aluminum powder and glass fiber, is in the range of about 3 7 to about 3 2 and is preferably intherange of about 1 2 to about 1 1 the weight ratio of block copolymer to glass fiber is at least about 2 1, and is preferably in the range of about 2 1 to 10 1 and the weight ratio of glass fiber to aluminum powder is at least about 1 9 and is preferably in the range of about 1 4 to about 1 1. The component ratios are preferably selected so that the melt viscosity of the hot melt composition is less than about 300,000 and preferably less than 150,000 cps. at a temperature of 2500C. and a shear rate of 4 sec measured in a Brookfield Thermocel Unit Model HBT.Above 300 000 centipoise melt viscosity, the hot melt is difficult to apply and spread, and tends to be dragged from the point of application. The hot melt composition is formed by mixing the aluminum powder and the glass fiber with the melted polymer in any convenient way such as by melt blending in a blenderextruder. A good mix is considered to have been obtained if the filler particles are evenly distributed through the melt.In poor mixes, the filler particles are not adequately wet by the melt, and tend to be unevenly distributed, remaining aggregated within the melt. Melt stability of the mix is determined by maintaining the mix at 2160C. for two hours. If the melt viscosity changes less than 10 percent during this time, the mix is considered to have melt stability. Creep resistance of the compositions of the present invention is determined by observing the sag of a 10 to 15 gran sample of the composition placed on an aluminum plane inclined at 600 to the vertical. The observations are carried out at 1750C. and 2050C. Creep or sag in less than 60 minutes at the designated temperature is recorded as a failure to meet the tee Impact strength is determined by applying the composition as a hot melt at 5000F. 2600C. to a smooth steel panel 7.5 cm X 22.5 cm to provide a strip 4 cm wide and in the range of 25 to 250 microns thick. The panels are conditioned for 24 hours at 300C. Onelb. 4g steel balisaredropped onto the strip of composition from heights of 18 inch 46 cm and 36 inch 92 cm . The impact is repeated three times at 15 minute intervals.If chipping or cracking of the composition or separation from the steel panel occurs, the composition is considered td have failed the test. Similar test panels are prepared for testing of the sandability of the composition. In the preparation of the panels the ease of flow of the hot melt composition is observed and its ability to be spread or trowelled to provide a smooth cohesive strip is noted, The panel is cooled to room temperature and a disc sander, 12.5 cm diameter, with 80 grit medium tungsten carbide abrasive, is applied to the composition at 1000 rpm to smooth and feather the composition. If the surface of the composition becomes smooth enough to accept paint without telegraphing or showing a difference in reflectivity between the painted steel and the painted composition, and without blinding or blocking the abrasive surface of the sander, the composition is rated sandable. Depending upon the particular substrate and especially when the substrate is bare metal, it can be advantageous to apply a primer coat to improve the adhesion of the hot melt composition. Suitable primers include the commercially avail .able primer coatings, and the etherified methylolmelamines described in U,S. Patent 4,053,682. Also suitable, can be organic solvent solutions and aqueous dispersions of the block copolymer component of the hot melt adhesive composition. The hot melt adhesive compositions of the present invention find widespread utility in a wide variety of applications. They are especially valuable in those applications where resistance to creep at elevated temperatures is a necessary requirement. The adhesive compositions of the present invention may be used to great advantage to bond a variety of substrates including metal, glass, synthetic and natural textiles, leathers, synthetic polymeric sheet material. wood, paper, etc. The present invention also includes the concept Ot incorporating various ingredients into the adhesive composI tion to improve processing and or performance of these materials. These additives and adjuncts include antioxidants, thermal stabilizers, extenders, dyes, pigments, adhesion pro motets, plasticizers, etc. The following examples are set forth in illustration of the invention and should not be construed as a limitation thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 A block copolymer which is approximately 65 percent by weight crystalline polyethylene terephthalate segments and 35 percent by weight amorphous polyamide made from dimer acid and hexamethylene diamine, is prepared in two steps. In the first step 157.5 parts 0,272 mol of a C36 dibasic acid and 30.8 parts 0.266 mol of hexamethylene diamine are charged to a reaction vessel and heated with agitation at about 2150C. for one hour to form a polyamide resin.During the first 30 minutes the pressure rises to 1000 kPa after which time the reaction vessel is vented to reduce the pressure to 600 kPa At the end of one hour the pressure is released and 332 parts of a crystalline polyethylene terephthalate M.P. 260 C. inherent viscosity 0.147 and 7.5 parts 0.095 mol o ethylene glycol are charged to the vessel along with a minor amount of an antioxidant. The vessel is flushed with nitrogen and the mixture is heated to about 280 C, while maintaining a nitrogen pressure of 240 kPa. After 0.5 hour the vessel is vented and vacuum applied and the reaction is continued under full vacuum 0.1 to 5 mm, of mercury for two hours.At the end of this time the resulting molten poly ester amide is discharged under pressure into a water bath to quench the material, The polymer obtained melts at 2050C. and the inherent viscosity is 0.50. A filled composition of block copolymer, aluminum powder and glass fiber in the weight ratio of 50 37.5 12.5 is prepared by the following procedure To a stainless steel reactor fitted with an anchor agitator and a jacketed hot oil heating system is added 100 parts by weight of the poly ester amide and heating is begun.When the contents have reached 2500C., agitation is begun at 60 rpm and 100 parts by weight of a mixture of dry aluminum powder Alcoa Atomized Powder 123 of average particle size about 17 microns and milled glass fiber of average length 1 16 inch 1.59 mm is fed into the mass at a rate of 10 parts by weight per minute.

Agitation is continued for 15 minutes after the addition of the mixture is complete and the molten mass is discharged under slight N2 pressure 250 kPa , quenched in a bath, ground and redried. This material is used as a hot melt to fill dents and orifices in a metal plate. After application it is cooled to room temperature, sanded smooth with 80 grit tungsten carbide abrasive and painted with an automotive surface coating.No telegraphing1, is observed.

Examples 1, 2 and 4 further show that an optimum in impact resistance at 300C. occurs when the ratio of glass fiber to aluminum is in the range of about 1 4 to 1 1.Lap bond tensile strength ASTM D 1002 72 of Examples 2 1 and 4 are 185 and 171 kgXcm EXAMPLE 8 A hot melt adhesive composition is prepared by mixing 150 parts by weight of dry aluminum powder Alcoa AtomizedPowder 23 and 50 parts by weight of milled glass fiber of average length 1 16 inch 1,59 mm , with 100 parts by weight of the block copolymer of Example 1 by the procedure set forth inExample 1. The composition is used as a hot melt to fill dents and orifices in a metal plate. The hot melt flows rather poorly and is trowelled smooth wth some difficulty. After application, it is cooled to room temperature, sanded smooth with 80 grit tungsten carbide abrasive and painted with an automotive surface coating.No telegraphing of the composition through the coating is observed. When the hot melt adhesive composition is subjected to the impact test at 300C., it passes the 18 inch pound 2.03 J and 36 inch pound 4.07 J tests EXAMPLE 9 A hot melt adhesive composition is prepared as inExample 8 with a weight ratio of glass fiber to aluminum powder of 1 1. The hot melt proves to be impossible to flow or trowel except at temperatures which degrade the polymer EXAMPLE 10 A hot melt adhesive composition is prepared by the method set forth in Example 1 from 100 parts or the block copolymer of Example 1, 112.5 parts of aluminum powder AlcoaAtomized Powder 123 and 37.5 parts of milled glass fiber of average length 1 32 inch 0.8 mm . The composition passed the 18 inch pound 2.03 Joule impact test at 300C, but failed the 36 inch pound 4.07 Joule test. EXAMPLES 11 13 Hot melt adhesive compositions similar to the composition set forth in Example 10 were prepared from milled glass fiber of average lengths 1 16 inch 1.6 mm , 1 8 inch 3.2 mm and 1 4 inch 6,4 mm . The data for impact tests carried out on the cspositions at r300C, are presented inTable 2 and show that the impact resistance is superior when the fiber length is 1 16 inch or greater.
