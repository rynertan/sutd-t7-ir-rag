# Ion generating apparatus.

## Abstract
An ion generating apparatus comprises a cylindrical vacuum vessel 5 within which an anode 1 and cath odes 3, 4 are disposed. The anode 1 is provided with an inner tubular hollow portion and the cathodes 3, 4 are located near both end openings of the anode 1 . The apparatus further comprises means 2, 7 for applying a voltage between the anode 1 and the cathodes 3, 4 , a magnetic field generator 8 , means for supplying op erating gas into the hollow portion of the anode, and an evacuating device. At least one of the cathodes is pro vided with a through hole at the central portion thereof. The apparatus further comprises a control electrode 10 steteched in the hollow portion in parallel with but apart from the central axis of the hollow portion.
