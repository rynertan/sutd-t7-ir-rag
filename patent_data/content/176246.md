# METHOD AND KIT FOR DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF GUM DISEASE

## Abstract
A method and kit for the detection of proteolytic enzymes in gingival crevicular fluid to aid in diagnosing the presence of inflammatory gum disease. A sample of gingival crevicular fluid is taken up in an absorbent collector, which is then placed in contact with insoluble immobilized collagen containing a bound label such as a dye. After incubation for a short time, if there are any proteolytic enzymes in the sample of fluid, the collagen is degraded to soluble fragments which are taken up in the absorbent sample collector, and are detected by measuring the presence of the label on the collector.
