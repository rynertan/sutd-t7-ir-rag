# Plate heat exchanger.

## Abstract
In a plate heat exchanger comprising a plurality of plates stacked together to define passages 4, 5 for heat exchanging fluids, the flow resistance of each passage 4, 5 varies across ist width so that the time taken for fluid to flow through such passage can be generally the same for all flow paths 6, 7 between the inlet and outlet openings 2 of the passage. The plates are provided with a corruga tion 8 defining ridges and grooves whose width and or depth varies in a direction transverse to the flow direction in such way that each passage is narrower at the side of the plates where the inlet and aoutlet openings for the pas sage are located and wider at the opposite side.
