## Description
This invention relates to a fuse circuit unit, and more particularly to a fuse circuit unit which can be dismountably mounted on an electromagnetic switch. An automotive vehicle is equipped with various electric equipments. In automotive vehicles having a limited space for such electric equipments, such as motorcycles, some electric equipments are designed such that an electric equipment carries thereon another electric equipment related thereto or its component parts in a combined fashion. For example, an electromagnetic switch for closing and opening a starting circuit of an automotive engine has been proposed by Japanese Provisional Utility Model Publication No. 55 15707, on which is integrally mounted a main fuse of a main circuit connecting between electrical loads of the automotive vehicle and the battery. DE A 3209915 discloses an electric relay with an integrated fuse unit having a removable cover so that the fuse can be easily removed and replaced, and DE A 3225319 discloses a fuse unit for enabling easy replacement of fuses. However, an electromagnetic switch and a main fuse of a load circuit such as a lamp of an automotive vehicle are inherently not electrically related to each other, and therefore there is no absolute necessity to combine such fuse with the electromagnetic switch. For this reason, in conventional automotive vehicles in general there are used some electromagnetic switches of the type carrying no fuse. Therefore, a switch manufacturer has to supply electromagnetic switches of the type carrying no fuse, as well as ones of the type carrying a fuse. As a result, the manufacturer has to manufacture both of these types, which is disadvantageous in respect of productivity, stock control, etc. It is the object of the invention to provide a fuse circuit unit which can be dismountably mounted on an electromagnetic switch, thereby adapting the same electromagnetic switch to be both combined with a fuse and separate therefrom and thus enhancing the mass productivity. The present invention provides a fuse circuit unit for dismountably mounting on an electromagnetic switch having an input terminal and an output terminal. The fuse circuit unit comprises a first terminal member having one end thereof adapted to be connected to one terminal of a main fuse of a load circuit, and another end adapted to be connected to the input terminal of the electromagnetic switch a second terminal member having one end thereof adapted to be connected to another terminal of the fuse, and another end adapted to be connected to the load circuit a casing supporting the first and second terminal members engaging means provided on the casing for engagement with engaging means provided on the electromagnetic switch and fastening means for removably fastening the first terminal member to the input terminal of the electromagnetic switch to mechanically and electrically connect them together. Preferably, the casing of the fuse circuit unit is molded from a resin in a one piece body, together with the first and second terminal members. Also preferably,the engaging means provided on the casing is formed integrally with the casing. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a fuse circuit unit for combination with an electromagnetic switch of the type having a switch casing, a coil accommodated within the switch casing, a cover secured to the switch casing, an input terminal and an output terminal each having a connecting screw threaded portion thereof outwardly projected from the cover, and a pair of connecting terminals of the coil outwardly projected from the cover. The fuse circuit unit comprises a first terminal member having one end thereof formed with a holding portion for holding one terminal of a fuse, and another end thereof formed with a through hole for having the connecting screw threaded portion of the input terminal of the electromagnetic switch disengageably fitted therethrough a second terminal member having one end thereof formed with a holding portion for holding another terminal of the fuse, and another end thereof provided with an output terminal portion disposed for juxtaposition with the connecting terminals of the coil a casing supporting the first and second terminal members and defining therein a fuse accommodating space surrounding the holding portions of the first and second terminal members, and a terminal accommodating space surrounding the output terminal portion of the second terminal member and an opening formed in the casing and adjacent the output terminal portion, the opening being disposed to be penetrated by the connecting terminals of the coil engaging means provided on the casing for engagement with engaging means provided on the cover of the electromagnetic switch for holding the casing combined with the cover and screw means for removably fastening the other end of the first terminal member having the through hole fitted on the connecting screw threaded portion to mechanically and electrically connect them together. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring first to Fig. 1 showing a fuse circuit unit according to the invention, useful in explaining how to mount the fuse circuit unit 1 onto an electromagnetic switch 10, the fuse circuit unit 1 is adapted to be dismountably mounted on the electromagnetic switch 10 in such a manner that its terminals 3 and 5 are fitted on fixed contact members 13 and 14 of the electromagnetic switch 10 together with feeder cables 30 and 31 and then fastened thereto, as hereinafter described. The fuse circuit unit 1 is essentially composed of a casing 2, and terminals 3, 4 and 5 secured within the casing 2. The terminal 3 also serving as a mounting terminal has one end 3a thereof formed as a fuse connecting terminal portion 3c, and the other end 3b formed therein with a fitting through hole 3d. The fuse connecting terminal portion 3c has a generally T shaped configuration when unfolded, as shown in Fig. 3, and has a pair of rectangular wings 3e and 3e laterally projecting in a symmetrical fashion. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, these wings 3e, 3e are bent toward a central portion 3a , with their lateral edges 3g and 3g directed toward an inside surface of the central portion 3a with a predetermined gap The mounting terminal 3 constructed as above is formed of a one piece metal sheet, preferably of copper such that the bent wings 3e, 3e are elastically urged in the folding direction to fully function as contacts. The terminal 4 has one end 4a thereof formed as a fuse connecting terminal 4c and the other end 4b bifurcated into two connecting terminal portions 4d and 4d and extending parallel with the connecting terminal portion 4c, as shown in Fig. 2. The connecting terminal portion 4c has just the same configuration and is wrought in the same manner as the connecting terminal portion 3c. Also the mounting terminal 4 is formed of a one piece metal sheet, preferably of copper, like the mounting terminal 3. These connecting terminal portions 3c, 4c of these mounting terminals 3, 4 are to be connected with respective connecting terminals 21 and 22 of the blade fuse 20 and mecanically coupled thereto in a manner supporting the blade fuse 20. The terminal 5 also serving as a mounting terminal is provided to reinforce or stabilize the connection of the fuse circuit unit 1 to the electromagnetic switch 10. One end 5a of the mounting terminal 5 is obliquely cut off and the other end 5b is formed therein with a fitting through hole 5d similar to the mounting through hole 3d of the mounting terminal 3. This mounting terminal 5 per se is not electrically connected to any other component parts, but merely serves to mechanically reinforce the mounting of the fuse circuit unit 1 to the electromagnetic switch 10. These terminals 3, 4 and 5 are arranged in a predetermined array as shown in Fig. 2, and retained in place after the casing 2 is formed into a one piece body by molding from a synthetic resin material with these mounting terminals maintained in their respective places so that they are partly fixedly embedded in the hardened synthetic resin. Thus, the fuse circuit unit 1 is completed as shown in Fig. 5. In the completed unit 1, the connecting terminal portions 3c, 4c are accommodated within a fuse accommodating space 6 defined by a four sided peripheral wall 2a of the casing 2. The other connecting terminal portions 4d, 4d of the terminal 4 are accommodated within a terminal accommodating space 7 defined by a three sided peripheral wall 2b and the peripheral wall 2a. The casing 2 has a bottom wall formed therein with an opening 2c Fig. 1 enclosed by the peripheral wall 2b and extending alongside the connecting terminal portions 4d, 4d and through which connecting terminals 16 and 17 of the electromagnetic switch 10 are to be loosely fitted. Further, the casing 2 has opposite lateral side surfaces 2d and 2d formed integrally with downwardly depending engaging portions 2e and 2e at locations close to the other ends 3b, 5b of the mounting terminals 3, 5. These engaging portions 2e, 2e are formed with engaging through holes 2f and 2f which open in ceiling surfaces of the engaging portions 2e, 2e . Also, the opposite lateral side surfaces 2d, 2d of the casing 2 are formed integrally with a pair of engaging protuberances 2g only one of which is shown at vertically central portions of the peripheral wall 2a. Referring again to Fig. 1, the electromagnetic switch 10 is formed by a casing 11, and a cover 12 secured to the casing 11 in a manner covering an opening, not shown, in the casing 11. The fixed contact members 13 and 14 and a movable contact member 15 Fig. 6 are arranged in the cover 12. The fixed contact members 13, 14 have bolt shaped or screw threaded portions 13a and 14a vertically upwardly projected from a ceiling surface 12a of the cover 12. Further arranged on the same ceiling surface 12a of the cover 12 are coil connecting terminals 16 and 17, hereinafter referred to, also vertically upwardly extending parallel with the bolt shaped portions 13a, 14a of the fixed contact members 13, 14. The cover 12 has its opposite lateral side edges formed integrally with engaging protuberances 12b, 12b for mating with the respective engaging through holes 2f, 2f of the fuse circuit unit 1. Accommodated within the casing 11 are a coil 18, and a plunger 19 disposed to move within a central opening of the coil 18 against the force of a return spring, not shown, as shown in Fig. 6. The coil 18 has its opposite ends connected to the respective connecting terminals 16, 17 projected on the cover 12, at locations inside the casing 11. The cover 12 is fitted with the casing 11 and rigidly secured thereto by caulking. A coupler 40 is provided, which is adapted to be inserted, from above, into the terminal accommodating space 7 in the fuse circuit unit 1, and comprises a main body 41, and a cover 42 which is fitted over an upper portion of the peripheral wall 2a defining the fuse accommodating space 6. The cover 42 has its opposite lateral side surfaces provided with a pair of downwardly depending engaging pieces 42a only one of which is shown , which each have its tip formed with an engaging pawl 42b for engagement with the respective protuberances 2g on the opposite lateral side surfaces of the peripheral wall 2a of the casing 2. Disposed within the interior of the main body 41 are connecting terminals, not shown, for connection with respective ones of the connecting terminal portions 4d, 4d of the mounting terminal 4 and coil connecting terminals 16, 17 of the electromagnetic switch 10. Connected to these connecting terminals within the main body 41 are ends of wires 45 48 which are connected at the other ends to electrical equipments, etc., hereinafter referred to. To mount the fuse circuit unit 1 onto the electromagnetic switch 10, first the connecting terminals 21, 22 of the blade fuse 20 are force fitted into the respective connecting terminal portions 3c, 4c of the mounting terminals 3, 4 of the fuse circuit unit 1 so that the terminals 3, 4 are electrically connected to each other by way of the blade fuse 20, and at the same time the blade fuse 20 is placed inside the fuse accommodating space 6 of the casing 2. Then, as shown in Fig. 1, the mounting through holes 3d, 5d of the mounting terminals 3, 5 are fitted, from above, onto the screw threaded portions 13a, 14a of the fixed contact members 3, 5 on the cover 12 of the electromagnetic switch 10, and then moved downward along the screw threaded portions 13a, 14a, until the protuberances 12b, 12b of the cover 12 become engaged with the respective engaging through holes 2f, 2f of the engaging portions 2e, 2e of the casing 2. In this way, the fuse circuit unit 1 is mounted on the cover 12 wherein the screw threaded portions 13a, 14a of the fixed contact members 13, 14 penetrate through the mounting holes 3d, 5d of the mounting terminals 3, 5, and the coil connecting terminals 16, 17 are loosely fitted through the opening 2c of the casing 2 to extend in the upward vertical direction in parallel juxtaposition with the connecting terminal portions 4d, 4d of the mounting terminal 4. Then, a solderless terminal 32 joined to a feeder cable 30 is fitted onto the screw threaded portion 13a of the fixed contact member 13, and a nut 36 is screwed onto the portion 13a to tighten the mounting terminal 3 and the solderless terminal 32 together via a washer 34 fitted on the portion 13a. Thus, the mounting terminal 3 is electrically and mechanically connected to the fixed contact member 13. Similarly, a solderless terminal 33 joined to a feeder cable 31 is fitted onto the screw threaded portion 14a of the fixed contact member 14, followed by fitting a washer 35 and screwing a nut 37 onto the portion 14a to tighten the mounting terminal 5 and the solderless terminal 33 together via the washer 35. In this way, the fuse circuit unit 1 is firmly secured on the cover 12 of the electromagnetic switch 10. After thus mounting the fuse circuit unit 1 onto the electromagnetic switch 10, the coupler 40 is mounted, from above, onto the casing 2 in such a manner that the main body 41 is inserted into the terminal accommodating space 7 to connect its connecting terminals to the respective connecting terminals 4d, 4d 16, 17, the cover 42 is fitted over the upper portion of the fuse accommodating space 6 to enclose the fuse 20 within the space 6, and the engaging pawls 42b engage the engaging protuberances 2g. The feeder cables 30, 31 are connected, respectively, to a positive terminal of the battery 50 and a connecting terminal of a starting motor 51 of an internal combustion engine, not shown. The connecting terminal portion 4d of the terminal 4 of the fuse circuit unit 1 is connected to a load 53 by way of a wire 45 and a main switch 52, and the connecting terminal portion 4d of same is connected to an output terminal of an alternating current generator 55 installed on the engine, by way of a wire 46 and a rectifier 54. The coil connecting terminal 16 of the electromagnetic switch 10 is grounded via a wire 47, and the other coil connecting terminal 17 is connected to a load connecting terminal of the main switch 52 by way of a wire 48 and a starting switch 56. With the above arrangement, when the main switch 52 is closed, the load 53 becomes connected to the battery 50 through the fuse 20 to be supplied with electric power from the battery 50. When the starting switch 56 is then closed, the coil 18 is energized so that the plunger 19 is electromagnetically attracted to move downward against the force of the return spring, not shown, so that the movable contact member 15 is brought into urging contact with the fixed contact members 13, 14 by the force of a contact spring, not shown, to close the electromagnetic switch 10, thereby actuating the starting motor 51 to start the engine. When the starting switch 56 is opened after the engine has been started, the coil 18 is deenergized so that the plunger 19 is moved upward by the force of the return spring to push up the movable contact member 15 against the force of the contact spring to to separate the contact member 15 from the fixed contact members 13, 14, thereby causing the electromagnetic switch 10 to open and thus stopping the starting motor 51. After having thus been started, the engine drives the generator 55 to generate an alternating current output. The alternating current output is converted into direct current by the rectifier 54, and supplied to the battery 50 through the terminal 4, fuse 20, mounting terminal 3, and feeder cable 30, to charge same. The fuse circuit unit according to the invention can provide many excellent advantages as follows
