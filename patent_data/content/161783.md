# Light receiving member.

## Abstract
A light receiving member comprises a light receiving layer of a multi layer structure having a first layer comprising an amor phous material containing silicon atoms and germanium atoms, a second layer comprising an amorphous material containing silicon atoms and exhibiting photoconductivity and a surface layer having reflection preventive function provided on a sub strate successively from the substrate side, said light receiving layer having at least one pair of non parallel interfaces within a short range and said non parallel interfaces being arranged in a large number in at least one direction within the plane perpen dicular to the layer thickness direction.
