# Toothed belt.

## Abstract
A drive belt 10 having an elongated body 11 provided with tensile cords 12 . The belt is provided with teeth, or cogs, 13 and a two ply reinforcement is provided on the surface of the teeth, or cogs, including an inner layer 15 and an outer layer 17 . The inner layer is formed of parallel yarn, or twine, elements 16 , which may be spirally wrapped to extend in the longitudinal direction of the belt. The outer layer is formed of a woven or knit cloth, and in the illustrated embodiment, is formed of a sailcloth having a highly elastic warp extending in the longitudinal direction of the belt and an inelastic weft for providing improved transverse rigidity and strength. The first layer yarn 16 and second layer warp 19 preferably have a ductility of greater than 50 . A number of candidate ma terials for the high ductility yarns is disclosed.
