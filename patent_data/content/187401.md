# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp provided with a discharge vessel having a ceramic wall and a ceramic end plug which is arranged therein by means of sintering in a sunken position and in which a current supply member of a main electrode is arranged in a gas tight manner by means of a sealing ceramic connection. Outside the discharge space enclosed by the discharge vessel, a ceramic filling piece is arranged, which adjoins with a capillary intermediate space the wall of the discharge vessel, the end plug and the current supply member. The capillary intermediate space is filled substantially entirely with sealing ceramic. With this construction of the vessel end, the sintered joint between the wall of the discharge vessel and the end plug is completely covered by sealing ceramic and the sealing ceramic is prevented from extending into the discharge space.
