# Protective layer for thermal heads and other conductive and heating devices.

## Abstract
An electrical device comprising a heating or conductive element on a substrate, and covered by a protective layer, characterised in that the protective layer comprises one part by weight polymide resin and from 1.1 to 3.2 parts by weight of a particulate filler selected from SiC, Al₂O₃, Si₃N₄, SiO₂ and Ta₂O₅. The device may be a thermal head which includes a heating element layer and a conductive layer on the substrate, with a protective layer covering the heating element layer. The filler is preferably SiC.
