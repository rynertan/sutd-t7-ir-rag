# Process for making objects from mineral fillers bonded with a thermosetting resin.

## Abstract
Three dimensional shaped objects are made by moulding a material, a moulding material consisting of mineral fillers and a thermosetting resin with a hardener being first evenly distributed outside the mould, the assembly sheet that has been prepared in this way and is still pliable being transferred to the mould and subsequently subjected to pressure at an elevated temperature, with a layer of powdery, thermosetting resin with catalyst, which resin is made to melt and polymerize, after which the pretreated moulding material is installedin the mould and subjected to pressure. While the resin is melting, a fibre layer can be applied to it.
