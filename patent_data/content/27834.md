## Description
Thermally sensitive microbial rennet, a process for its preparation and its application for cheese preparation The invention relates to a thermally sensitive microbial rennet, to a process for the preparation of such thermally sensitive microbial rennet as well as the use of such obtained thermally sensitive microbial rennet for the cheese preparation and the use of the obtained whey for further food processing. It is well known to prepare various types of milk coagulating enzymes, further to be mentioned microbial rennet, by cultivation of certain Mucor miehei strains in suitably selected culture mediums and recovering the microbial rennet from the fermentation broth. Such processes are disclosed in e.g. U.S. patent no.3988207 and U.S. patent no. 4136201. Moreover from U.S. patent 4136201 and more particularlyU.S. patent 3616233 it was known to prepare microbial rennet, which is substantially free of lipase and or esterase. The so obtained milk coagulating enzymes are successfully applied for the preparation of various types of cheese, giving rise to a major byproduct called whey. Whey has been looked upon as a potential starting material for processes to prepare a variety of food stuffs. Such processes essentially comprise the pasteurization and spray drying of whey in order to obtain a powder, which is very rich in valuable ingredients of food stuffs. This powder is subsequently mixed with milk or liquids derived from milk in order to obtain homogeneous, attractively looking finally desired products. A well recognized problem of this processing of the whey is the occurrence therein of residual, still active microbial rennet, which is still able to coagulate milk or liquids derived from milk and which actually prevents the preparation of the desired homogeneous, attractive looking products. It was found that whey containing calf rennet, did not give such problems, due to a relative greater thermal instability of such rennet, and that the hereinbefore mentioned problems, connected with the use of microbial rennet containing whey, could only be eliminated by a previous heating step to destruct residual microbial rennet, using relatively high temperatures such procedure, however, gives rise to unattractively colored products. On the other hand, from e.g. U.S. patent no. 4086139 was known the selective inactivation of amylase in a mixture of protease and amylase by contacting the mixture with hypochlorite or chlorite ions as oxidizing agent in an amount which is effective for the inactivation of the amylase to a substantially greater extent than the protease. From U.S. patent no. 4087330 was known the regeneration of a spent immobilised enzyme composition by treating it with aqueous sodium hypochlorite, the spent immobilised enzyme composition comprising a porous, high surface area, insoluble inorganic support material having contaminants associated with it. All contaminants aretremoved by this regeneration process whereafter the support material is reacted with an enzyme, such as glucose isome rase, glucoamylase or lactase, in aqueous solution. However, this process is primarily used for the removal of the enzymeresidues, which have become inactive after their use. Moreover the Belgian patent no. 848175, discloses the chemical fixation of organic substances containing a sugar residue to a support containing at least one reactive amino group, by the oxidation of at least one hydroxymethyl group in the sugar residue to an aldehyde group, and reacting the resulting aldehyde group with amino groups carried by side chains fixed to an insoluble solid support. This process can be used to immobilise glycoproteins, such as enzymes, while as oxidizing agent e.g. a sodium iodite is used. One of the objects of this invention is to provide a novel thermally sensitive microbial rennet which has retained the major part of its milk coagulating activity at the ordinary temperature of cheese making. With the term thermally sensitive is meant to indicate that the microbial rennet looses its milk coagulating activities almost completely at temperatures above 60 C. Another object is to provide a novel process for producing such a thermally sensitive microbial rennet. A further object is to provide an improved process for the preparation oP cheese, using the novel thermally sensitive microbial rennet. An additional object is to provide an improved method for the preparation of food stuffs derived from the whey, which is the residue of the cheese preparation, using the novel, thermally sensitive microbial rennet. The present invention relates to a novel, thermally sensitive microbial rennet, which has retained the major part of its milk coagulating activity, and more specifically relates to a thermally sensitive microbial rennet, which becomes deactivated under normal process conditions for the preparation of food stuffs, derived from whey, i.e. it looses its milk coagulating activities almost completely at temperatures above 60it. As a result of research and experimentation it was surpri singly found that novel thermally sensitive microbial rennets can be prepared by a process, comprising the treatment of a microbial rennet containing liquid with a chemically modifying agent. The process may be applied as well to a filtrate, derived by recovery of the fermentation broth, obtained by cultivation of a Mucor strain in a suitable nutrient medium and preferably aMucor miehei strain, or to a more or less concentrated filtrate, obtained by evaporation under reduced pressure or by ultrafiltration of such filtrate.As suitable chemically modifying agents for the presently proposed treatment of the microbial rennet compounds such as salts of trichlorocyanuric acid, periodic acid, peracetic acid, hypochloric acid, chlorid acid and iodic acid√ßor mixtures thereofcan be used. Preferably the sodium, potassium or calcium salts of these acids and more especi ally sodium hypochlorite are used. The modifying process is preferably carried out in an aqueous solution, having an activity corresponding with 0.5 4 g of active chlorine per liter of starting medium and more preferably 1.5 2 g of active chlorine per liter of microbial rennet containing medium0 According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the agents are added to the microbial rennet containing liquid, in the form of 5 20 ml of an aqueous stock solution, having an activity corresponding with 140 160 g of active chlorine per liter, per liter of microbial rennet containing medium. The obtained degree of the loss of milk coagulating activity is found to increase with increasing concentration of hypo chlorite and varies in the range of from 0 15 of the original activity. The process is carried out at temperatures varying from the temperature of freezing the solution to room temperature, i.e. at temperatures in the range of from 10 to 25C, whereby the higher temperatures in the range have been found to give rise to more inactivation, although such an increase has been found to be very weak. The process can be carried out at pH values varying in the range of from 2 to 8 and more preferably in the range of from 2.5 to 5. According to another feature of the invention, it was surprisingly found that as a result of the modifying reaction a thermally sensitive microbial rennet could be obtained, which was substantially free of any lipase and or esterase activity, any of such activity, present in the microbial rennet containing starting liquid being completely deactivated by and as a result of the process. Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, the originally present lipase and or esterase activity is eliminated by carrying out the process at a pH value of about 2.5 in order to eliminate the usual previous separate inactivation step for this accomponying lipase esterase while the present process may succesfully be carried out at pH values in the range oP Prom 4 5, when starting from microbial rennet containing solutionst which are substantially Pree oP lipase and or esterase. The major part of the thermal instability of the desired microbial rennet can be obtained according to the process of the present invention within 1 15 minutes after mixing the modifying agent with the microbial rennet containing solution, while for obtaining the desired degree of thermal instability, total reaction times of up to 4 hours may be necessary, depending on the actual activity of the oxidizing agent, the working temperature and pH value. During the process of the present invention, the coloration of the microbial rennet decreases significantly 10 to 25 X , while the finally obtained microbial rennet moreover has a more attractive appearance and smell as compared to the untreated microbial rennet. It will be appreciated that these improved characteristics of the thermally sensitive microbial rennet represent an advantage inherent in the present invention. Moreover, another advantage of the process of the present invention is that it can be carried out in rather simple equipment, e.g. in a usual tank with a stirrer and is consisting of rather simple measures at all. In this connection it will be appreciated that the rate of the addition of the oxidizing agent has appeared to have only little influence or no influence at all on the loss of milk coagulating activity of the microbial rennet when subjected to the treatment according to the invention. The thermally sensitive microbial rennet according to the present invention has a normal shelf life not essentially different from that of ordinairy untreated microbial rennets, when stored at pH values in the range of from 4.0 to 6.0 and preferably of from 4.5 to 5.5. According to a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, it has appeared to be possible to obtain a thermally sensitive microbial rennet which has lost about 5X of its original milk coagulating activity. by a treatment with 10 15 ml of a sodium hypochlorite solution, having an activity corresponding with about 150 g active chlorine l, per liter of microbial rennet containing medium, i.e. fermentation liquor, at a pB between 3.7 and 5.0 and for a wide range of reaction times. According to another preferred embodiment of the process it has appeared to be possible to prepare a thermally sensitive microbial rennet, which is substantially free of lipase and or esterase activity, by treatment of a starting solutipn, which contains the normal amounts of lipase and or esterase, with 5 ml of sodium hypochlorite solution per liter of microbial rennet containing medium at a pH of about 2.5. It will be appreciated that the surprisingly obtained results of the rather simple process of the present invention could in no way be predicted by people skilled in the artt as it has appeared that not all conventional oxidizing agents could be used. E.g. hydrogen peroxide did not give any practical result As indicated hereinbefore, the process of the present invention may be as well applied to microbial rennet containing liquids, which are exhibiting lipase and or esterase activity, as to those ones, the lipase and or esterase activity of which has previously been substantially eliminated during a recovery process as described in U.S. patent 3B616,233 all relevant parts of which have to be considered as integrally inserted herein. The microbial rennet activity is determined by the following analytical method. The time of clotting a defined milk substrate is used to calculate the coagulating activity of the microbial rennet. One soxhlet unit is the amount of rennet which is clotting one ml of milk substrate in 40 minutes at 35C. The substrate is prepared by dissolving 100 g of skimmed powdered milk in one liter of 0.2 g l calcium chloride solution. The measured time must be in the range of from 4 to 20 minutes. The activity is calculated according to the following equation 40 x Vo p activity in t x cxV soxhlet unitsVo volume of milk substrateV volume of enzymatic solution t clotting time in seconds c concentration of enzyme in V ml. For the Mucor miehei microbial rennet the same analysis is also realized at 630C. Due to its thermostability, the activity of Mucor miehei rennet at 630C is about 170 percent of the activity at 350C. The evolution of the activity at 630C is a direct measurement of the thermostability of the Mucor miehei rennet. The esterase activity preferably is measured by a test on tributyrin, whereas the lipase activity preferably is measured by a test on an olive oil substrate. These tests can be carried out according to the methods as described in column 2, lines 45 68, columns 3 and 4 and column 5, lines 1 41 of U.S. patent no. 4065580, the contents of which have to be considered as integrally inserted herein. The following examples illustrate the practice of the invention and are not in any way to be considered as limiting to the spirit or scope of the invention. Example 1 One liter of a microbial rennet containing filtrate was obtained after fermentation with an isolate from Mucor mieheiNRRL A 13042 and recovery of the fermentation broth in the usual way, during which possibly present lipase and or esterase activity is eliminated according to the method of US patent 3,616,233. This filtrate has an activity of 112.00 Soxhlet units ml at 350C and of 193.00 units at 630C. To this filtrate 10 ml of a sodium hypochlorite stock solution, having an activity corresponding with 150 g active chlorine per liter, were added under stirring in an open vessel. The temperature of the mixture was kept at 7.50C and the pH was 4.1. After 4 hours processing, the activity of the microbial rennet was measured again. The respective activities are listed below. clotting activity in Soxhlet units 35 C 63 C units ml percent units ml percent units mi percent unitsj ml percent reference sample 11 200 100 19 300 173 processed sample 10 400 93 less than 0 100 Example 2 To one liter of a microbial rennet containing solution, obtained by filtration of the fermentation broth from a Mucor miehei fermentation as produced according to example 1, followed by ultrafiltration and deactivation of lipase and or esterase according to the method described in US patent 3,616,233, 10 ml of a sodiumhypochlorite solution, having an activity corresponding with 150 g liter of active chlorine, were added under stirring and the liquid was processed in the same way as in example 1. The clotting activities of the liquid before and after the treatment are listed below. clotting activity in Soxhlet units 35 C 63 C units ml percent units ml percent reference sample 224 000 100 400 000 180 processed sample 216 000 96 less than 0 00 200 Example 3 A filtered microbial rennet solution obtained from aMucor miehei fermentation as produced according to example 1, is con centrdated by ultrafiltration, while the esterase activity is not removed. To one liter of such solution, 12 ml of sodium hypochlori te having an activity corresponding with 153 g of active chlorine liter were added under stirring at a temperature of 50C and at pH 2.5. Stirring was continued during 4 hours and the clotting activity and the esterase activity were determined1 as listed below. clotting activity in Soxhlet units 35 C 63 C esterase activity units ml percent activity unit el percent ea units reference 250 000 100 425 000 i 70 15 ea sample processed 237 500 95 less than 0 0.2 ea sample 200 From these values it can clearly be derived that the thermostability of microbial rennet has decreased while simultaneously esterase has been inactivated. The microbial rennet obtained can be used to make cheddar cheese without developing any rancidity on aging. The whey resulting from manufacturing cheese does not demonstrate any residual milk clotting activity when normally processed, i.e. when subjected to pasteurisation at 600C and spray drying.
