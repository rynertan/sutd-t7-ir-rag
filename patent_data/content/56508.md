# A method of and apparatus for increasing the thrust produced by a fluid jet discharging from a pipe.

## Abstract
The thrust of a jet of fluid 5 issuing from a pipe is increased by arranging that the fluid discharges into a tube 2 of larger diameter than the pipe outlet, the tube being joined at one end in a fluid tight manner to the pipe outlet and having a length such that the other end 1 of the tube 2 is just contacted by the periphery of the jet of fluid 5 after passing through the tube 2 . The presence of the tube 2 causes a suction effect in the annular space 4 around the pipe outlet thereby increasing the jet speed. The invention can be applied to a fluid propulsion system, to the nozzle of a fire fighting hose, to the exhaust from an internal combus tion engine or the gas propulsion jet issuing from an aircraft or a hovercraft.

## Description
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for increasing the thrust produced by a jet of fluid issuing from a pipe or nozzle and is applicable to the fluid jet issu ing from the propellor nozzle of a boat, the nozzle of a jet propelled boat or the nozzle of a fire fighting or other hose pipe, the exhaust gases discharged from an internal combustion engine or other power unit, or the gas pro pulsion jet issuing from an aircraft or hovercraft, In all the ai ove en ioned forms of jet, except in the caz of the jet issuing from the propellor nozzle of a boat, the fluid is zzer pressure within the pipe or nozzle and achieves its magnum velourty at the discharge end of the pipe or nozzle, at which point thrust is imparted to the nozzle. After the fluid leaves the nozzle its velocity decreases due to frictional contact with the ambient medium into which it discharges, It has been found, according to the present invention, tha if the outlet of the pipe or nozzle is arranged to discharge into a flibe of larger diameter than the nozzle, which tube is joined at one end in fluid tight manner to the nozzle outlet and is of such a length that the tube outlet is joust contacted by the periphery of the jet of fluid after the latter has issued from the nozzle and passed through the tube, then due to the effect of fluid friction on the static fluid surrounding the jet, suction will be created in the annular space formed between the periphery of the jet, after issuing from the pipe or nozzle, and the remainder of the tube wall.In response to this suction the pressure drop across the nozzle outlet is increased and results in an increase in jet speed at the nozzle while the tube will prevent the sound of the jet from escaping into the ambient medium until the velocity of the jet has become appreciably lower. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates the flow pattern of the fluid jet issuing from a conventional jet pipe or nozzle Figure 2 illustrates the flow pattern obtained in accordance with the present invention Figures3 to 5 illustrate the effect of altering the length of the tube Figures 6 to 11 show various ways of forming the discharge end of the tube Figures 12 and 13 illustrate the operation of a conventional propellor nozzle Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the application of the invention to a propellor nozzle Figures 16 and 17 illustrate the flow pattern of the fluid jet issuing from the tail pipe of a jet aircraft operated in the choked condition Figure 18 illubstr3te the application of the invention to the tail pipe of Figures 16 and 17 and Figure 19 illustrates the application of the invention to the exhaust pipe of a motor vehicle or other prime mover exh st, The flow pattern of the fluid issuing from a conventional jet pipe or nozzle is roughly as shown in Figure 1 whereas the principle of the invention is illustrated diagramatically in Figure 2 in which 1 denotes the outlet of a tube 2 joined at one end in fluid tight mauner to the outlet of a nozzle 3 and 4 denotes the space within which the suction is created. Because the length of the tube 2 is such that a jet 5 issuing from the nozzle 3 makes contact with the tube 2 only at the discharge end 1 of the latter, the fluid jet is not constrained by the tube and accordingly, the point of thrust remains at the outlet of the pipe or nozzle and is not transferred to the discharge end of the tube. The increase in the pressure difference across the outlet of the pipe or nozzle 3 due to the suction created in the tube 2 results in an increase in thrust because the velocity of the jet 5 has increased in proportion to the square root of said pressure difference, The extra work which is required to achieve this result is obtained from the velocity of the particles of the fluid jet 5 after they have left the outlet of the nozzle or pipe 3 and after the jet has done its work of creating thrust.The system, from the point of view of work done, may be considered as analogous to a steam engine with a condenser as opposed to a steam engine ex.hausting direct to atmosphere without s condenser. The effect of altering the length of the tube 2 is shown inFigures 3 to 5. In Figure 3 where the tube 2, is very short it has little or no effect on the jet 5 since the outlet of the pipe or nozzle 3 is surrounded by the ambient air and the jet functions as a standard jet which issues at ambient fluid pressure. The only area of suction is that indicated by hatching 6 at the inner end of the tube 2. In Figure 4, where the tube 2 is very long, the jet 5 is constrained by the tube and in accordance with Bernoullits theorem, the total energy of the fluid at the outlet of tbe pipe or nozzle 3 equals the total energy of the fluid at the tube outlet so that the point of thrust has been transferred to the tube outlet 1 where t velclcl y of the jet is lower. The suction acting on the fluid is indicated by the hatched area 7 extending along the length of the jet So Figure 5 illustrates the position according to the invention, in which the outlet 1 of the tube 2 is just contacted by the periphery of the fluid jet 5.To reach this position from the position shown in Figure 4 the tube 2 is slowly shortened and its outer end 1 begins to allow ambient fluid to flow into the suction annuls but this is at first countered by the velocity of the fluid jet 5 which tries to push it out again , As the tube 2 is further shortened ihe ambient fluid begins to push back the suction area 8 until, as shown in Figure 5, the ambient fluid occupies the space 4 around the jet 5 in the outer half of the tube whilst the inner half of the tube at 8 remains under suction. Under these conditions the point of thrust is now at the outlet of the pipe or nozzle So To introduce a vernier effect to the adjustment of the length of the tube 2, the discharge end 1 may, as shown in Figures 6 to 9, be formed with one or more rows of serrations 9, slots lO,per√®rations 11 or cut off at an angle to the diameter of the tube, as shown at 12 and or, as shown in Figures 10 and 11, provided with an annular flange 13 or 14 of less diameter than that of the rest of the tube. In this manner the entry and discharge of ambient fluid into and from the outlet end 1 of the tube 2 upon adjustment of the tubes length takes place more gradually than would otherwise be the case. It has been found in practice, in cases where it is physically difficult to adjust the length of the tube 2, that a tube of a fixed length which is a compromise between the extremes illustrated inFigures 3 and 4 may be used over the main working range of the jet.In this way, a good proportion of the available power advantage can be realised with a simpler construction. In the case of a conventional propellor nozzle 15, an example of which is shown in Figure 12, it will be seen that because the fluid issuing from the nozzle is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water, there is a considerable suction created at the propellor intake 16 at low boat speeds and it is the pressure or suction difference, illustrated in Figure 13, across the propellor 17 and nczzle 15 that creates extra thrust in addition to the thrust imparted by the velocity energy in the water jet issuing from the propellor nozzle. Wher however, a tube 2 of the kind already described is added to this nozzle 15, as shown in Figure 14, a suction, in addition to the original pressure drop across the nozzle, is created at the nozzle outlet 18 and inlet 16 since the ambient pressure on the surrounding water is transferred to the tube outlet 1. In this manner, still greater thrust is imparted to the ship at low speeds, as indicated in Figure 15. The invention is particularly applicable 1. To the increase of speed and reduction of noise in pure jet and f jet aircraft. If, f. instance, the tube 2 is adjusted in the manner shown in Figure 4 at the moment of starting the run before take off, then the suction at the intake to the jet engine will be greater with a greater overall pressure difference between the tail tube outlet and the engine intake, much as with the propellor nozzle.Greater thrust will therefore be available at the beginning of the takeoff run. As the aircraft gathers speed the pilot will adjust the tube 2 in the manner shown in Figure 5 and have greater actual take off and flying speed and improved noise reduction. The invention can also be applied to jet aircraft in which the jet is operated in the choked condition. Figure 16 shows such a jet where, because of the choking effect, the contour of the fluid jet 5 billo s out, and in order to harness the velocity energy which is thus created outside the choked jet, it has become standard practice toarrange a tube 19 around the outlet of a jet pipe 20 in order to use this energy to draw secondary air, represented by arrows 21, into the tube from around its inlet and eject it through the tube outlet as shown in Figure 17. This practice has the disadvantage, however, that the secondary air 21 can only mix with the paid jet at the periphery of the latter leaving a central core 28 of gas, the extra velocity energy of which is not employed in imparting additional thrust to the aircraft.To overcome this disadvantage, an additional tube 23 is fitted in accordance with the invention. As will be seen from Figure 18 the suction effect created by the space around the outlet of the jet pipe 20 induces more secondary air from around the inlet of the tube 19 to flow into the body of the fluid uet 5 and mi therewith, thus reducing the central core and creating additional thrust. The wall of the tube 23 may be perforated or slotted, as shown for example, at 25 to allow ingress of secondary air where required.2. To the increase in speed and reduction in noise of jet propelled boats. It is possible to increase boat speed by about 1 and when used in conjunction with the propulsion unit described in tE PatentSpecification No 1289094, boat speed can be increased by a further 6 .3. To increase the effectiveness of propellor nozzles.4. To increase the scavenging effect and reduce the silencing loss on motor vehicle engines, gas turbines and other internal combustion engines. Hhen a tube 26 is fitted to the outlet of a motor vehicle exhaust pipe 27, as shown in Figure 19 it can produce a lowering of exhaust pipe pressure and the exhaust gas can discharge to atmosphere at apressure below atmospheric without loss of energy, since energy is gained from the mass of gas leaving the tube 26 as is the case with a water jet. It is to be noted also that this lowering of exhaust pipe pressure is a junction of engine speed rather than vehicle speed. The system works, therefore, when the vehicle is stationary or moving as compared with most exhaust tail trimmers which depend on vehicle speed only for their action.
