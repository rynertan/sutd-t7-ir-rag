# HETERODIMERIC T LYMPHOCYTE RECEPTOR

## Abstract
Disclosed is a heterodimeric T lymphocyte receptor comprising an alpha and a beta subunit. Each subunit consists of a signal peptide, variable, joining, constant, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. The two subunits are connected by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues located between the constant and transmembrane region. The structure, amino acid, and nucleotide sequence of the lymphocyte receptor were determined using cDNA clones derived from a functional murine cytotoxic T lympho cyte clone. The genes corresponding to these cDNA are expressed and rearranged specifically in T cells and have significant sequence homologies to immunoglobulin V and C genes. Both the T cell receptor protein and it subunits may be produced from the cDNA clones. The protein molecules may be further used for the production of T cell clone specific antibodies.
