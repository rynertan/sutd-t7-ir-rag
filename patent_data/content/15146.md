# Polyester compositions and processes for moulding them.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising i thermoplastic polyester of aliphatic diol and dicarboxylic acid, at least 95 mole percent of said acid being terephthalic acid, ii inert particulate nucleat ing agent iii plasticizer and or oligomeric polyester and iv segmented polyester polyether block copolymer are dis closed as useful moulding compounds. The preferred polyes ters include poly ethylene terephthalate and the crystalliza tion rate of the polyester component is promoted by compo nents iii and or iv so that the compositions can be moulded to form crystalline products at low temperatures. Moulding processes of the invention are carried out at less than 100 C mould temperature.
