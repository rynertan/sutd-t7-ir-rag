# Continuous harvester for plants grown in rows.

## Abstract
In a method of and apparatus for harvesting a row of grapevines, a pair of opposed parallel striker bars 24, 25 are pivoted back and forth transversely of the row of grapevines about an axis A A that is situated over the plants and that extends parallel to the direction of travel of the harvester. The front ends of the striker bars 24, 25 are supported by a front shaker frame 32 , and the rear ends of the striker bars are supported by a rear shaker frame that is free to pivot independently of the front shaker frame. Dual eccentric weight oscillatory drives 36, 37 are mounted to the front and rear shaker frames. Various drive arrangements are disclosed for rotating the eccentric weights on the front and rear shaker frames at different frequencies, amplitudes or phase relationships, as desired. Due to the different motions of the front and rear ends of the opposed striker bars 24, 25 , the bars impart a varying shaking action on the grapevines as the bars are translated forwardly relative to the grapevines.
