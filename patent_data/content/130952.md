# AN ARRANGEMENT IN STATIC CONVERTERS

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement in a static con verter, including at least one pair of mutually co acting switching transistors TR1, TR2 , of which the first switching transistor TR1 is arranged to be controlled with a frequency exceeding the control frequency of the second switching transistor TR2 . A diode D1, D2 is connected between the emitter and collector of respective switching transistors. The novel feature of the invention resides in that a voltage source N1, P is arranged to be activated when the first switching transistor TR1 is energized to its conducting mode I
