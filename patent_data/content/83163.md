# Heavy hydrocarbon conversion catalyst and process using same.

## Abstract
A select group of hydrocarbon conversion catalysts suitable for converting carbo metallic oil containing high boiling heavy hydrocarbons such as reduced crudes to lower boiling tansportation fuels and a method for their preparation is described. The select catalysts of this invention contain at least one zeolite in high concentration and said zeolite possessing a high silica alumina ratio and a high lanthanum exchange content dispersed in a clay refractory metal oxide matrix possessing high pore volume and large pore size. In addition, the matrix material of large pore size and high pore volume is prepared to provide acidic cracking activity and contains select metals as the oxide for the immobilization of vanadium and or select materials for the trapping of deposited metals Ni, V, Fe, Na to counteract the detrimental effects of these metals in the regenerator section.
