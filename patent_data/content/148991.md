# A high speed microinstruction unit.

## Abstract
A high speed, integrated circuit microprocessor includes a microinstruction sequencer for sequentially generating a plurality of N control words per period, each control word having a plurality of M bits. The microsequencer includes a storage register in the integrated circuit, having a plurality of M times N storage locations, for storing a microinstruction containing the N control words. The microsequencer also includes an N bit shift register in the integrated circuit, having N sequential outputs and a clock input with a cycle time equal to 1 N of the period, for propagating a binary bit therethrough to sequentially provide an enabling bit to each of the respective N outputs thereof. A plurality of M logic stages is also included in the integrated circuit, each stage including a plurality of N AND gates, and each of the AND gates having a first and a second input, an i
