# Process for the recovery of practically radium free calcium sulphate, yttrium and lanthanides.

## Abstract
Recovery of yttrium, lanthanides and radium free calcium sulphate in a phosphoric acid process by digest ing A phosphate rock 1 with an excess of phosphoric acid in the presence of 5 wt. of SOâ‚„ ions calculated to the amount of phosphate rock, seperating E out the insoluble residue and recovering yttrium and lanthanides therefrom, precipitating C calciumsulphate from the remaining solution with suiphuric acid 11 and separat ing F this calciumsulphate 18 from the resulting phosphoric acid solution 19 .
