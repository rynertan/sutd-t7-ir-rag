## Description
This invention relates to an interleukin 2 composition useful as a drug. Interleukin 2 hereinafter sometimes referred to by the abbreviation IL 2 is a protein capable of functioning as a growth factor for T cells and natural killer cells which are considered to play an important role in The present inventors found that IL 2 is unstable and easily loses its activity during the process of freezing or lyophilization and during storage following lyophilization, in particular in the step of drying in lyophilization and that solutions obtained upon redissolution of lyophilized IL 2 preparations generally assume turbidity. These facts, among others, are very unfavorable for the use of IL 2 for therapeutic purposes. Under these circumstances, the present inventors conducted further intensive investigations and succeeded in producing a stable IL 2 composition, and have now completed the present invention. The present invention provides an IL 2 composition which comprises human serum albumin, a reducing compound or a combination thereof and is adjusted to a pH of 3 to 6 as a solution. In the practice of the invention, the IL 2 may be of any mammal origin but is preferably of human origin. The IL 2 may also be a natural one or a product of the recombinant DNA technology, although the latter is preferred. It is generally used in the form of an aqueous solution of IL 2. Preferred examples of IL 2 are non glycosylated human IL 2 species produced by genetic engineering and having the formula wherein X is Met or hydrogen. Mixtures of these may also be used. In the above formula I , each amino acid residue is represented by the abbreviation according to the IUPAC IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature. The IL 2 desirably has a specific activity of 20,000 to 80,000 units mg and is advantageously used in the form of an aqueous IL 2 solution having a concentration of 1 to 80,000 units ml, preferably 10 to 50,000 units ml, more preferably 50 to 5,000 units ml. The above aqueous IL 2 solution as the raw material in the practice of the invention is preferably free from salts such as sodium chloride. When said solution is contaminated with a salt in the IL 2 purification process, for instance, it is preferable to remove the salt by ultrafiltration, for instance, prior to use thereof. The human serum albumin hereinafter referred to by the abbreviation HSA may be of any grade. For clinical application of the composition according to the invention, however, said HSA is preferably of a quality allowing the use by parenteral administration. For instance, there is used HSA fractionated and purified by Cohn s 6th method of ethanol fractionation with healthy human plasma as the starting material J. Am. Chem. Soc. Said HSA may also contain acetyltryptophan sodium or sodium caprylate as a stabilizer. The addition level of HSA is preferably 0.1 to 50 mg, more preferably 0.5 to 20 mg, per milliliter of the aqueous IL 2 solution having an IL 2 concentration within the range mentioned above. The reducing compound is preferably a physiologically acceptable reducing compound and thus includes sulfur containing reducing compounds such as glutathione reduced form hereinafter simply appreciated glutathione , thioctic acid, N acetylcysteine, N acetylhomocysteine, thiodiglycol, thioethanolamine, monothioglycerol, dithiothreitol and thioalkanoic acids containing 1 7 carbon atoms e.g. thioglycolic acid, thiomalic acid , and ascorbic acid and salts thereof, amongst others. Preferred are acidic compounds such as glutathione, thioctic acid, N acethylcysteine and ascorbic acid, and particularly preferred are glutathione and ascorbic acid. The reducing compounds mentioned above may be used either alone or in combination of two or more. These reducing compounds are used preferably in an amount of not less than 0.01 mg, more preferably 0.05 to 20 mg, per milliliter of the aqueous IL 2 solution having a concentration within the above mentioned range. HSA and the reducing compound mentioned above may be used both of them within the above mentioned range or each of them alone, and HSA is preferably used. The IL 2 composition according to the invention may further contain one or more substances selected from among amino acids, in particular monoamino aliphatic amino acids and cyclic amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and proline, monosaccharides such as glucose and mannose, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol, and physiologically acceptable salts and derivatives thereof. Among these auxiliary additives, glycine is particularly preferred. The above auxiliary additives are preferably used in amounts of 10 100 mg for monosaccharides and sugar alcohols and 5 50 mg for amino acids per milliliter of the above mentioned aqueous IL 2 solution. The IL 2 composition according to the invention may further contain an isotonizing agent such as sodium chloride, a buffer such as succinic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid, and or a surfactant. However, the IL 2 composition is preferably free of sodium chloride from the viewpoint of stabilization in the process of lyophilization. In order that the IL 2 composition according to the present invention gives a pH of 3 to 6, preferably 3 to 5.5, more preferably 3.5 to 4.5, said composition is adjusted to a pH within the range specified herein with an acidic reducing compound or an acidic amino acid such as glutamic acid when such compound is added, or, in cases when if further desired and when no acidic compound is contained, with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid, or a buffer of organic acid such as succinic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid. The stability of the above IL 2 composition may be further increased by evacuating the space within containers for the IL 2 composition or filling said space with nitrogen. The IL 2 composition according to the invention preferably takes the form of an aqueous solution, or frozen matter, or lyophilizate , in particular the form of a lyophilizate. The composition according to the invention may be produced, for example in the following manner Monosaccharides, sugar alcohols and amino acids, for instance, may also be added in the respective concentrations mentioned above. If desired, an isotonizing agent, and a surfactant may further be added. When some substance other than HSA is added, pH adjustment is performed in the manner mentioned above so that the final aqueous solution can have a pH within the above range. The IL 2 composition thus obtained may be used also as the raw material in producing a frozen matter or a lyophilizate in the manner mentioned below. The frozen form of the IL 2 composition may be produced, for example, by freezing the above aqueous solution generally at 80 to 20 C. Said frozen composition is preferably stored at 80 to 10 C. The lyophilizate form of the IL 2 composition may be produced, for example, by drying the above frozen composition under reduced pressure in the conventional manner or by freezing the above aqueous solution or an aqueous solution resulting from thawing the above frozen composition, in the same manner as above, following distribution thereof as desired, and then drying the resulting frozen composition under reduced pressure by the conventional method. Furthermore, the IL 2 composition according to the invention which is in the form of a solution may be produced by redissolving a lyophilizate containing IL 2, HSA or and a reducing compound or and a pH adjusting agent as produced by the method mentioned above in a solvent containing a monosaccharide, sugar alcohol or amino acid and pH adjusted, for example, with hydrochloric acid, as desired. In producing the lyophilized IL 2 composition according to the invention as an injectable preparation, it is preferable to combine the IL 2 containing aqueous solution with an additive containing aqueous solution, each after separate sterile filtration, or purify a mixture of the IL 2 containing aqueous solution and an additive containing aqueous solution by sterile filtration , then distribute the mixture aseptically into vials and subject the mixture in vials to the above mentioned lyophilization treatment. In dissolving the lyophilizate in an aqueous solution containing an amino acid, monosaccharide or sugar alcohol, it is preferred that the aqueous solution is subjected to sterile filtration, then distributed into ampuls and autoclaved prior to its use as the solvent. The IL 2 composition according to the invention is advantageously characterized, among others, in that the decrease in IL 2 activity during storage and freezing and lyophilization procedures is minimum and that when it occurs as a lyophilizate, the solution obtained upon redissolution thereof is clear and transparent. The IL 2 composition according to the invention, in particular the one in the form or lyophilizate, has an improved appearance and the adsorption thereof on the container wall is effectively prevented. The composition which also contains an amino acid, when lyophilized, assumes an improved appearance. The pain at the time of administration thereof by injection is also effectively alleviated. The monosaccharide containing composition also attains a pain alleviating effect at the time of administration thereof by injection. Among those IL 2 compositions provided by the invention, the lyophilizate form may be obtained as a stabilized IL 2 powder and may be used advantageously as a preparation for parenteral administration, among others. In using as a preparation for injection, the lyophilizate is dissolved in 0.5 100 ml of distilled water for injection or physiological saline, for instance, or in 0.5 100 ml of a solvent attached to the lyophilizate composition for exclusive use therefor, which is an aqueous solution of an amino acid such as glycine, a monosaccharide such as glucose or a sugar alcohol such as mannitol as pH adjusted as necessary, and the solution is administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Said composition may also be used in the form of preparations for administration into the oral or nasal cavity or to the eye or ear as made up by using an appropriate carrier, excipient or diluent. The IL 2 composition according to the invention is low in toxicity and may be used for the same purposes and in the same manner as the known IL 2 preparations, in particular for use in the production of an anticancer agent or a therapeutic agent for immunodeficiency. The IL 2 activity data given in units U in the present specification were obtained in the following manner Specifically, an IL 2 dependent mouse cell line NKC3 Hinuma et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, All IL 2 containing test sample was distributed, in 50 µl portions, into the first row of wells on a 96 well flat bottomed microtiter plate Nunc, Denmark , followed by serial doubling dilution to the 12th row using 50 µl of 20 FCS added RPMI 1640 medium per well.
