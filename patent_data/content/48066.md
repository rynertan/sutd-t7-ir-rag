# Television circuit for use on signal recording and signal display, respectively.

## Abstract
Television circuit comprising a signal correction circuit which is active on signal recording and display respectively, to obtain an optimum picture on display, and comprising a memory, memory location RG containing correction infor mation of which correspond to picture subregions RC , each having their scanning lines H1 H16 , these subregions RC having been arranged in a matrix of rows and columns. According to the invention the memory comprises further memory locations HOC namely a first, further memory location HOC1 HOC7 for each column of subregions, absolute correction information being present in each first memory location for all subregions in the column and relative difference information being present in each mem ory location R1C1 R19C7 corresponding to a subregion in the column, each relative difference information per subre gion furnishing a correction information for each scanning line in the subregion which information is valid with respect to the preceding scanning line. At a linearity correction of, for example, the horizontal line scan a more or less vertical, shifted, curved information line 4 can be corrected to form a vertical, straight line 3 in the exact position, by means of, for example, an absolute correction from a point 4, to a point 3₁ and a relative difference correction over sixteen scanning lines H, across the distance difference in the direction of line scan between the points 4₁ and 4₂, 4₂ and 4₃, etc.
