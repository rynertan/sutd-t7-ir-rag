# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TELEVISION RECEIVERS

## Abstract
A television receiver amplifier particularly suitable for fabrication as an integrated circuit. The amplifier configura tion is such that only integrated circuit components are required to provide a fully functional television receiver signal processing amplifier. A signal detector and a d.c. level restoring circuit having circuit configuration which permit the fabrication of fully functional units using only integrated circuit components, are described also
