# Multi layer coating process involving use of aqueous basecoat composition containing crosslinked polymer microparticles and having a pseudoplastic or thixotropic character.

## Abstract
A process for producing a multi layer coating upon a substrate surface, in which there is first applied to the surface a pigmented basecoat composition and then there is applied to the basecoat film a transparent top coat composition characterised in that the basecoat composition is based upon a dispersion in an aqueous medium of crosslinked polymer microparticles which have a diameter of 0.01 10 microns, are insoluble in the aqueous medium and are stable towards gross floc culation, the dispersion having a pseudoplastic or thixo tropic character.
