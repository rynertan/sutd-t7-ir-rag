# Process for preparing a solvent free crystalline polymorphous form of chenodeoxycholic acid.

## Abstract
The humid amorphous form of chenodeoxycholic acid undergoes a physical treatment at room temperature consisting in causing a collision of the particles of the amorphous product in bulk by means of shaking or stirring to prepare the solvent free crystalline form of chenodeoxycholic acid which melts at 168 170 C.
