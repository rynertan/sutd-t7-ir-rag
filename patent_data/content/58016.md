# Process for producing steel wire or rods of high ductility and strength.

## Abstract
A process for producing steel wire or rod having high strength and ductility comprises the steps of a hot rolling a steel comprising 0.2 0.4 by weight of C, and 0.5 2.5 by weight of Mn, balance iron and inevitable impurities, while controlling the rolling conditions so that intermediate and final rolling temperatures are below 1000 C, and the total reduction ratio at temperatures below 930 C is greater than 30 and b cooling said steel immediately after rolling to a temperature below 350 C at an average cooling rate of 20 25 C sec. The resulting steel has a martensitic structure and has high strength combined with high ductility. Up to 0.1 of Nb, up to 0.1 of V, up to 0.3 of Ti and up to 0.3 of Zr may be added to the alloy to further improve the ductility.
