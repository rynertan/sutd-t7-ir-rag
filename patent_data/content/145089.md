# AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTABLE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE

## Abstract
In order to find criteria for the adjustment of an optimum focus, lens correction, specimen shift and the like, measure ment are performed by means of a beam wobbler and the corresponding generation of a variable F s Î£ Xi Yi s in order to determine that s value for which F s is a minimum. Using This image shift value is then used to make a correction preferably automatically.
