# A leaky coaxial cable and method of making such a cable.

## Abstract
A leaky coaxial cable is designed to produce a defined coupling between its interior and exterior. A bonded and insulated outer conductive tape 3 of relatively large width relative to the cable diameter, is spirally wound at a low pitch angle around a dielectric cladding 2 on a central conductor 1 to provide at high frequencies a coupling level having minimal effect of the coaxial properties of the cable.
