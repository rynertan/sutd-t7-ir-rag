# LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A logic circuit has a first logic gate G₆ , having a plurality of inputs a and b and an output m , and a second logic gate comprising a driving FET Q₆ and a plurality of load FET s T₆ and T₆ . The gate of the driving FET Q₆ is connected to the output m of the first logic gate and the gates of the load FET s T₆ and T₆ are connected to respective inputs a, b of the first logic gate. The driving FET and the load FET s are connected in series. A pair of FET s T , T , one depletion mode and one enhancement mode, with their drains, sources and gates respectively connected in common may be used in place of a single load FET.
