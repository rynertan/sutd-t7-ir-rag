# Television camera tube.

## Abstract
A television camera tube comprising in an evacuated en velope 1 an electron gun 6 which, viewed in the direction of propagation of the generated electron beam 48 comprises successively a cathode 40 , a grid 41 , an anode 42 and a cylindrical electrode 45 with a diaphragm 46 , of which anode a part extends substantially perpendicularly to the electron beam. This part has an aperture 44 which on the side of the target is covered with a first metal foil 53 . This metal foil has an aperture 54 at the area of the electron beam which has a diameter which is not more than 0.15mm and not less than the diameter of the beam at that area. By covering the aperture 44 on the cathode side with a second metal foil 55 , which foil has an aperture 56 having a diameter which is smaller than the diameter of the aperture in the first metal foil and which not less than the diameter of the electron beam at that area, interference in the recorded image as a result of a return beam is considerably reduced without increasing the interference resulting from secondary electrons.
