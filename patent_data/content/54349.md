# AUTOMATICALLY FOCUSSED OPTICAL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An automatically focussed optical system in which two arrays of photosensitive detectors 22, 23 have different optical spacings respectively in front of and behind the image plane of the system, and sense different portions of the image. Differences in electrical signals generated by adjacent detectors C,D and E,F in each set, and indicative of differences in intensity of the corresponding portions, are processed to generate a focus drive signal Fd of a value related to an error in the focus of the image. This signal is used to adjust the focus. Two discrete arrays of detectors can be used or alternatively a single array tilted relative to the image plane can be used. In another example a transparent block 23 is inserted adjacent to a part only of a single detector array to thereby lengthen the optical path length of that part relative to the remainder of the array.
