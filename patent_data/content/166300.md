# RECEIVER FOR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING POSITION OF A STATIONARY STATION USING SAME

## Abstract
A GPS receiver 10, 20, 50 sets up an equation based on known position data and propagation delay time data transmit ted from two satellites and received simultaneously, and inde pendent of time epoch errors in the clocks of the satellites and the receiver. The receiver accumulates equations as data is re ceived. The position of the receiver station can then be derived from the accumulated equations. In order to enable the forego ing process, the GPS receiver is provided with a timer which is reset at the timing of transmission of the epoch signals from satellites so as to measure the signal propagation interval by latching the timer value upon receipt of each satellite signal. In practice, the receiver uses the following equations x
