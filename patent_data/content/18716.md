# NOISE BLANKER WHICH TRACKS AVERAGE NOISE LEVEL

## Abstract
A noise blanker which has circuitry that enables the threshold level of noise blanking to track the average background noise level is disclosed. In general, a controllable gate 20 receives an input signal and selectively passes and blocks the input signal in response to received noise blanking pulses which are generated in response to high peak magnitude noise impulses. A signal 27, Fig. 4A related to background and impulse noise is extracted from an input signal. A controllable gain noise amplifier 31 is utilized to amplify the separated background and impulse noise and negative feedback circuitry 35, 37, 39 50, 52, 39 is utilized to maintain the average peak output 33, 54 of the noise amplifier substantially constant except for occasional large magnitude noise impulses which do not substantially change the average peak magnitude of the background and impulse noise. The output 32, 36, 51 of the controllable noise amplifier 31 is applied to a threshold switch means 35, 40, 41, 50, 53, 41 which produces blanking pulses 47 in response to the amplified noise signal having a peak exceeding a magnitude 43 56 which is greater than the substantially constant peak output level of the noise amplifier. This results in a blanker circuit in which the threshold level of the blanking pulses closely tracks the average peak value 33 54 of the background and impulse noise.
