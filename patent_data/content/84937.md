# Electrical contact materials.

## Abstract
Electrical contact materials are provided which belong to the general category of copper that is overplated with a noble metal, usually gold. The improvement resides in the provision of an electroless nickel deposit laid down between the copper basis metal and the gold layer, which electroless nickel deposit acts as a barrier layer and is laid down from a particular class of nickel boron or nickel phosphorus baths. The nickel phos phorus bath should have, as well as conventional additives, an unsaturated carboxylic acid tensile stress reducing agent, pref erably at between 0.005 and 0.1 mol litre, and the nickel boron bath should include zirconyl or vanadyl ion as boron deposition enhancer preferably at between 0.001 and 0.1 mol litre. The thickness of this layer is preferably not more than 800 micro inches. There may be also an electroless deposit of an under layer between the basis metal and the barrier layer.
