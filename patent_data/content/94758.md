# Tachyarrythmia pacer.

## Abstract
A pacer subsystem for detecting the existence of tachyarrhythmia including means for measuring the average time interval between successive heart beats and for com paring a sample beat with both a percentage of this average, and with a preset time interval. If the sample beat period is less than both criteria, it is classified as a tachy beat. If the sample beat is longer than either time interval it is classified as a non tachy beat. Sequences of tachy beats are used to initiate an appropriate therapeutic stimulation regime. The pacer includes a central processing unit 18 and real time controller 22 connected to the heart by lead system 14 and providing functions such as timing, sensing and generating output pulses.
