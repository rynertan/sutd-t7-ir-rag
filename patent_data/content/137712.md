## Abstract
A post 10 includes an anchor member 14 mounted in the ground, and an upper post member 18 spaced from the ground and mounted on an intermediate member 16 which extends into the anchor member. Upon application of a force to the upper post member 18 , the intermediate member 16 is arranged to deform or break prior to the upper post member 18 or anchor member 14 in order that the intermediate portion 16 can be quickly and cheaply replaced. The height of the upper post member 18 can be adjusted by inserting a grooved pin 22 through the upper post member 18 and the seleted pair of aligned holes 26 in the intermediate member.
