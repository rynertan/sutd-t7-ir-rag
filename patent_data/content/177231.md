# Digital video recording.

## Abstract
A method of recording and reproducing a digital video signal, the method comprising recording the video signal in oblique tracks on a magnetic tape 6 using a four head digital video tape recorder, the four heads a, b, c, d being arranged in two head pairs 1, 2 disposed on diametrically opposite sides of a rotary head drum 3 , and the video data relating to each field being distributed evenly between the four heads a, b, c, d for recording, each oblique track comprising two half tracks 11, 12 separated by a central gap 13 in which audio data 14 may be recorded, and each field occupying a plurality of successively recorded pairs of half tracks 11, 12 with each field boundary located at a central gap 13 , and reproducing the video signal at a speed different from the normal reproduction speed using dynamic tracking 4, 5 by successively reproducing two half tracks 21, 22 from the first part of a first pair of adjacent oblique tracks, then jumping to reproduce two half tracks 27, 28 from the second part of a second pair of adjacent oblique tracks adjacent to the first pair and so on until all the data of one field has been reproduced, and then jumping to another field.
