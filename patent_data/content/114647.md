# Method for determining the concentrations of organic additives in plating baths.

## Abstract
The concentration of at least one organic additive in a plating bath is determined by providing a polished and preplated cathode, a reference electrode and anode in an electrolytic copper plating bath, passing an electric current from the anode to the cathode measuring the voltage difference between the cathode and reference electrode and comparing the difference to values for known concentrations of the at least one organic additive.
