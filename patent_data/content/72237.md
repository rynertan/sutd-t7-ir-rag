# Apparatus for scanning a sheet.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for scanning a banknote 33 . A lengthwise strip of the banknote 33 is illuminated with white light, and the banknote is moved parallel to its width. Light reflected from all regions of the lenghtwise strip is conveyed through an optical fibre fishtail array to a single photodetector, or to a spectroscope and thence to several photodetectors for colour scanning. The waveform pro duced by the or each photodetector is then characteristic of the surface of the banknote, and is used in an analysing circuit for banknote pattern recognition, or to sense the condition of the banknote with regard to its age or degree of soiling. The analysing circuit includes means for com pressing or expanding the lenght of the waveform to give it a standard lenght for subsequent comparison with one or more stored characteristic waveforms in a memory 16 . The apparatus also determines the mean level of intensity of the waveform in an integrator 9 , and includes a circuit 24 to 28 for obtaining the standard deviation of selected points of the waveform from the mean value, a low standard deviation indicating a badly soiled or worn banknote.
