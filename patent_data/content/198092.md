# SURFACE TREATED MAGNESIUM OR ITS ALLOY, AND PROCESS FOR THE SURFACE TREATMENT.

## Abstract
An oxide film is formed on the surface of magnesium or its alloy, a thermosetting resin film is formed thereon, and a conductive film is further formed thereon. The surface treated surface of magnesium or its alloy has a strong adhesion to magnesium or its alloy, and the surface treated magnesium or its alloy has an excellent corrosion resis tance, excellent heat impact resistance, and high surface conductivity.
