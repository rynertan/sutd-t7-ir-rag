# Garment bag.

## Abstract
A garment to be sold on a hanger is folded one or more times widthwise and packed in a generally rectangular bag 1 of transparent film, the bag being provided with a short zone of weakness 6 on a top edge to allow the hook 10 of the hanger to emerge, and with a full width zone of weakness 7 at the bot tom edge whereby the garment can be unfolded to hang on the hanger.

## Claims
Claims 1. A bag for packaging a garment on a hanger, comprising a generally rectangular envelope or bag of transparent film having a width selected to accommodate the width of the garment on its hanger and a depth substantially less than the depth of the garment on its hanger and having a top edge provided with a short centrally located zone of weakness whereby the front and back of the bag can be easily separated to allow the hook of the hanger to emerge and the bottom edge provided throughout its length with the zone of weakness whereby the front and back of the bag can be easily separated to allow the full width of the garment to emerge. 2. A bag according to claim 1 in which the bottom zone of weakness comprises two parallel lines of perforations disposed one on either side of the bottom edge and generally parallel therewith. 3. A bag as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 containing a garment mounted on a hanger and disposed in the bag with the hanger hook adjacent the top zone of weakness.

## Description
Garment Bag This invention relates to a garment bag for packaging garments to be displayed and sold, and in particular to a bag for a garment on a hanger. In organising the display of garments for sale, it is convenient to have the stock for sale in relatively compact separate packages which can be stacked neatly on a shelf or counter. However, many garments can only be seen to advantage if they are hanging unfolded. There is thus a need for a garment bag which is relatively compact and can be easily stacked and displayed on a counter, but which can be easily converted at point of sale into a form whereby the hanging garment can be displayed. If the garment mounted on a hanger is simply wrapped in transparent film, the package can be easily hung up and displayed, but is cumbersome to stack and store, because of its relatively large area and flimsy nature.A compact package, in which the garment is folded one or more times, cannot be displayed to advantage, as indicated above. We have now developed a simple solution to this problem in the form of a bag which comprises a compact package, but which can easily be adapted at point of sale to allow the unfolded garment to be hung. According to this invention there is provided a bag for packaging a garment on a hanger, comprising a generally rectangular envelope or bag of transparent film having a width selected to accommodate the width of the garment on its hanger and a depth substantially less than the depth of the garment on its hanger, and having a top edge provided with a short centrally located zone of weakness whereby the front and back of the bag can be easily separated to allow the hook of the hanger to emerge, and a bottom edge provided throughout its length with a zone of weakness whereby the front and back of the bag can be easily separated to allow the full width of the garment to emerge. The depth of the bag is preferably less than the width, a bag for an adult sweater typically being about 50 cm by 20 cm. By making the depth of the bag substantially less than the depth of the garment when hanging on its hanger, the package is conveniently compact for storage on the counter. When the bottom zone of weakness is ruptured the garment can be unfolded out of the bottom of the bag and can be hung with the open bag remaining in place over the hanger. The bag may be formed of any suitable transparent film and is conveniently constructed of a polyalkylene film such as polypropylene. The bag is conveniently generally transparent, although of course areas can be masked by printing, design etc. The zone of weakness at the top edge need only be a relatively short line of perforations, long enough for the hook of the hanger to be forced through. As the hanger is generally constructed of a rigid material such as polystyrene or metal, a simple single line of perforation is all that is necessary for easy rupture, since the rigid hook can be pressed firmly against the zone of weakness to rupture it. The full length zone of weakness at the bottom edge of the bag can be similarly constructed, i.e. may comprise a single line of perforations. To open such a bag requires the front and back faces of the bag to be firmly grasped and pulled apart and this can lead to irregular tearing. In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the bottom edge is provided with two parallel lines of perforation, generally placed one either side of the edge crease and generally superimposed one on the other, so that a narrow strip is formed, separated from the main part of the bag by the lines of perforation. This narrow strip is particularly easy to grasp and tear off. Alternatively, the zones of weakness can take other constructions, for example a preformed slit temporarily sealed by a removable strip of paper or plastic film. A further possibility would be a slit covered with a flap extending from one of the faces of the bag, the flap being sealed by a tacky adhesive. Constructions involving tacky adhesives are less desirable, however, since problems are caused by the opened bag adhering either to the garment or to other bags. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a bag as defined above surrounding a folded garment, the garment being mounted on a hooked hanger. The bag according to the present invention is suitable for all types of garment which are desired to be sold mounted on hangers. It is particularly suitable for light garments such as knitted sweaters, blouses and shirts, but is also adaptable for hosiery. A preferred embodiment is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 represents a general view of an unopened package containing a garment and Figure 2 is a general view of the opened bag with the garment hanging on a hanger. The bag comprises a generally rectangular envelope 1 of transparent polyalkylene film. The bag is conveniently formed from folded sheet material so as to have top and bottom folded edges 2 and 3 and welded side edges 4,5. The back of the bag may be provided with a resealable flap opening not shown . The centre of the top fold 2 is provided with a short line of perforations 6, formed by stamping the film. On either side of the bottom foldage 3 are provided full width lines of perforations 7, also produced by stamping, defining a bottom strip 8. The garment 9 is placed in the bag in a simple folded arrangement on its hanger, with the hanger hook 10 adjacent to the perforations 6. When it is desired to display the garment, the hook 10 is pressed firmly against the perforations 6 and pushed through. The bottom strip 8 is grasped firmly and torn off along the lines of perforation 7. The garment can then be unfolded to hang on its hanger with the bag still in place over the top of the garment and the hanger, as shown in Figure 2.
