# Apparatus for preventing fall of button parts from a chute.

## Abstract
A button attaching machine having an apparatus for preventing button parts 8 from falling from an intermediate chute 13 when the latter is detached from a chute assembly 1 . The apparatus includes a transverse lever 31 pivotally connected at one end to a bracket 21 mounted on a lower end of the intermediate chute 13 , and a blocking member 41 carried on the lever 31 remotely from the bracket 21 and having a first and a second projection 43 , 44 . The lever 31 is normally urged by a spring 34 to turn so as to cause the first projection 43 to penetrate into a channel 8 of the chute 13 , thus blocking the passage of the button parts B . When the chute 13 is mounted, the second projection 44 is pushed by a stop 12 until the first projection 43 is retracted from the channel 8 of the chute 13 , thus allowing the passage of the button parts B .
