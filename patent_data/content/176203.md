# Self refresh control circuit for dynamic semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A refresh control circuit for dynamic memory devices which may be incorporated with the memory cells on a single chip. The circuit includes a leakage current monitor circuit representing the leakage of a memory cell and an inverter circuit for detecting the leakage of the monitor so as to control the refresh operation automatically with the mini mum power consumption.
