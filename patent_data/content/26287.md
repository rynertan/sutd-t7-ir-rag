## Description
Flexible container for transport and storage of bulk goodsThe present invention concerns a flexible container for transport and storage, comprising a jacket, a bottom and a filling aperture and provided with lifting loops to the purpose of lifting the container.Containers of this kind, or large size bags, are used for transporting and storin3 bulk goods, and the quantity of bulk goods is usually from a few hundred kilograms up to several tons. Such large size bags have becn made in that a piece of naterial has been folded double and the double folded piece of material has been joined with a seam in its upper part, which at the same time constitutes the lifting loop or loops of the large size bag. Since in such large size bags the seam is located exactly wnere the greatest stresses are imposed when the bag is being lifted with a lifting hook for instance, a large size bag of this type is disposed to fail along the seam in the lifting loops.The flexible container, or large size boa3, may also according to teachin3s of prior art be made of a hose like blank of which the upper part, and naturally the lower pzrt as well, consists of intact, continuous material. A large size bag of tflis kind requires vertical seams, whereby owing to this circumstance the aesign is poor as regards strength.A problem solution of this type has been disclosed e.g. in the Finnish patent application No. 7 1681. In order that it might De possiDle of such a hose like blank, with intact upper end, to make also exceedinzly large large size bags, such a hose like blank must also have an exceeaingly large diameter. eut with modern machines by which for instance woven polypropyLene fabric is made no diameter size over a given limiting diameter can be produced. Therefore this is a distinct limitation on the manufaturing of a large size bag from such a hose like blank.The object of the invention is to provide a flexible container which can be formed of a hose like blank so that the lifting loops of the flexible container will reliably withstand all those major stresses which may act on the lifting loops in conditions of actual practice.The object of the invention is attained with a flexible container which is mainly characterized in that the lifting loops of the container have been formed of flap like parts which are direct extensions of the upper part of the container jacket and that said flap like parts have been interconnected by connecting seams in such manner that said connecting seams have been disposed to run at a substantial distance from the central area of said lifting loops. The other characteristic features of the container of the invention are presented in claims 2 through 4.Tne invention is described in detail with reference being made to certain advantageous embodiments presented in the figures of the attached drawing, but to which the invention is not meant to be exclusively confined.Fig. 1 presents in elevationat view, the blank having the shape of a cut off hose.Fig. 2 shows the blank of Fig. 1 in axonometric view.Fig. 3 shows, in axonometric view, the flexibLe container made fro the blank of Figs 1 and Z. Fig. 4 presents, in axonometric view, another embodiment of the lifting loop design of the invention.In the embodiment of Figs 1 3, the flexible container has been made of a hose like blank 11 which is open at its upper as well as lower end. On the upper eno of the blank 11, suDstantially in the centre, a cut has been made for the filling aperture 13. Furthermore on the upper end of the blank 11 the cuts ld have been m3de which define the flap like parts 14a,14b,15a,15b. On the lower part of the Dank 11 moreover the cuts 19 have been made, which define the flap like parts 20,21,22,23.From the blank of Figs 1 and 2, a flexible container as shown in Fig. 3 is made, having a jacket gila, a bottom 12, a substantially central filling aperture 13 and lifting loops 14aha and 14b,15b. The bottom 12 of the container can be made in a manner known in itself in the art, by connecting the flap like part 20 by a connecting seam to the flap like part 23 and similarly, the flap like part 21 by a connecting seam to the flap like part 22.According to the fundamental teaching of the invention, the lifting loops 14a,15a and 14b,15b, respectively, are formed as follows. The flap like parts 14a and 15a are folded to overlap, and substantially the lower margin of the flap like part 14a is connected with substantially the upper margin of the flap like part 15a by the connection3 seam 16. Hereafter, the flap like parts 14b and 15b are folded to overlap and substantially the lower margin of the flap like part 15b is connected with substantially the upper margin of the flap like part 14b by the connecting seam 17. Hereby on the lifting loops 14a,15a and 14b,15b, respectively, the connecting seams 16 and 17, respectively, are located on opposite sides of the lifting loops.Naturally, the flap like parts 14b and 15b may for instance be joined with each other so that substantially the lower margin of the flap like part 14b is connected by the connecting seam 17 substantially to the upper margin of the flap like part 15b. Hereby the connecting seams 16 and 17 come to lie on one side of the lifting loops.It is possible, if desired, to connect substantially the upper margin of the flap like part 14a with substantially the lower margin of the flap like part 1Sa by another connecting seam 16 and similarly, to connect the flap like parts 14b and 15b with each other in equivalent manner. In that case both lifting loops 14a,15a and 14b,15b, respectively, have two connecting seams 16 and 17, respectively, located on opposite sides and which are located at a substantial distance from the central area of the lifting loops.In Fig. 4 an embodiment hds been depicted which presents only one flexible lifting loop structure 44,45 having the same width as the container. A lifting loop stru ture of this kind is particularly appropriate for a flexible contained hazing no substantially central filling aperture and which is instead filled fro,n the side 43. In this embodiment, too, the flap like parts 44 and 45 are direct elongated extensions of the upper part of the hose like blank. The flap like parts 44 and 45 have been folded to overlap, and substantially the lower margin of the flap like part 44 has been connected to subtantially the upper margin of the flap like part 45 by the connecting seam 46. If desired, the upper marge of the flap like part 44 may be connected by the connecting seam 47 substantiaLly to tht lower margin of the flap like part 45, whereby the lifting loop structure 44,45 will have connecting seams 46,47 located on opposite sides of the lifting loop structure 44,45 and at a substantial distance from the central area of the lifting loop structure 44,45.In the foregoing only a few advantageous embodiments of the invention have been presented, and it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that they may be modified in numerous different ways within the scope of the inventive idea set forth in the claims following below.
