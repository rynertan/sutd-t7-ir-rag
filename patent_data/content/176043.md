# MECHANISM FOR POSITIONING A RIBBON IN A PRINTING MACHINE

## Abstract
A ribbon positioning mechanism comprises a ribbon cartridge, a nosepiece 16 , a stepper motor and flexible ribbon guides connecting the ribbon cartridge to the nose piece 16 . The nosepiece 16 has two side members 18,20 connected by a bridge 22 , one of which has a downwardly extending leg 28 . A rack 30 located on the bottom of the leg 28 engages a pinion attached to the stepper motor for lifting the nosepiece 16 into desired position. The ribbon, having a plurality of parallel color bands, passes from the ribbon cartridge via the flexible ribbon guides and through the nosepiece 16 where it is aligned with a print head. The nosepiece 16 freely slides on vertical guide posts attached to a print head carrier and printer logic controls the stepper motor to align the desired color band with the print head.
