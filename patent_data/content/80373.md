# Method of forming thin film magnetic head arrays.

## Abstract
A method for delineating vertically configured thin film ma gnetic heads formed upon silicon wafer substrates. A single crystal silicon substrate 30 is prepared step 1 with 110 sur face orientation. A plurality of thin film magnetic head arrays 36 are formed step 2 on the 110 oriented surface of the substrate so that the edges of the arrays are aligned parallel to the III planes of the substrate. Following photolithographic formation step 3 of a mask 38 , ion beam milling step 4 per pendicular to the 110 oriented surface of the silicon substrate delineates the thin film magnetic head array structures. There after, the remainder of the silicon substrate is anisotropically etched step 5 to completely delineate the individual array structures.
