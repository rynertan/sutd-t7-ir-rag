## Description
MEAT SUPPORTThis invention relates to a support device for use as a cooking aid during roasting of meat, poultry, fish and the like.In cooking roasts, the meat is generally in contact with the bottom of the cooking pan, resulting ina sticking of the meat to the pan as it cooks. The result usually is a scorched pan and an under or unevenly cooked meat portion. Any gravy formed during the cooking is generally wasted since it is singed with the bottom portion of the meat. More likely, the gravy that is formed is not available to the cook since to remove the gravy usually means removing the meat first. This causes the lengthening of the cooking time and an interruption in the uniform cooking of the meat. The meat generally remains immersed in the meat juices or grease, and has a tendency to reabsorb the grease flowing around it. If the moisture content of the meat is low, the lower portion of the roast is, in effect, fried to a crust.If the moisture content of the meat is high, the lower part of the roast is stewed in the meat juices and grease, and much flavour is lost.Not only is the meat not properly and uniformly cooked, but contact with the bottom of the cooking pan causes a difficult cleaning problem. The scorched meat contacted portion of the pan requires scouring and substantial rubbing with cleaning pads or soap to remove the scorched crust formed thereby. As noted above, the gravy and grease usually burn away or are absorbed by the meat portion when the roast or poultry is in direct contact with the bottom of the cooking pan. Thus, prior cooking devices where the roast is in contact with the pan cause the constant rise in the rendered liquid constituents resulting from the cooking operation. This results in grease saturation of the lower portion of the roast, heat charring of the meat and pan, and consequent sticking of the roast to the receptacle where heat concentration is relatively great.There are known apparatus for holding the meat above the bottom of the. cooking vessel however, many of these are integral with the pan itself and these raised portions are themselves scorched or encrusted by the grease formed. Also being fixed to the pan, these support portions cannot be used if meat is to be cooked in portions at variance with the size of the pan. Other devices used during roasting of meats are expensive to manufacture and awkward to use. Those movable supports that have been used are generally sharp ended or pointed metal that could cause a safety problem. Because of these drawbacks, few meat support devices have attained any marked commercial success.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a meat support and cooking device devoid of at least some of the above noted disadvantages.Another object of this invention is to provide a movable meat support device that is economical to manufacture and relatively easy to use.A further object of this invention is to provide a cooking aid for holding a roast above the surface of a cooking pan and isolating the meat from the greases and meat juices formed during cooking.A further object is to provide a meat support which eliminates the charring and burning of the bottom of the pan during the cooking operation.A still further object of this invention is to provide a safe, yet efficient device useful to uniformly cook on all sides of meat, poulty and the like.Another object is to provide a cooking aid that can be removably secured to the bottom portion of a roast for supporting it at both varied and uniform distances from the bottom of the cooking vessel.Still another object is to provide a meat support that promotes even cooking of the roast, and reduces cooking time. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a support device for meat or the like which is to be roasted or baked, characterized by a pair of rounded end portions adapted to rest upon the bottom of a roasting pan or the like in point contacti xwith , an intermediate portion at a substantially higher elevation than the end portions, said end portions and said intermediate portion forming substantially a semi circle in side elevation and at least one upwardly directed prong formed from such intermediate portion for piercing engagement with said meat.According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a support device for a meat portion to be cooked characterized by a base portion and an upwardly projecting prong, and being constructed of a plastics material with said prong positioned substantially equidistant from the ends of said base portion, said prong having a triangular configuration and being adapted to pierce said meat portion and to hold it in position when in contact therewith, said base support portion being integral with said prong and adapted to support said meat portion in spaced relationship from the bottom of a cooking pan.According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a support device for use in cooking meats characterized by at a main raised support portion and b a triangular prong integral with said main support portion and extending upwardly therefrom said main raised support portion comprising rounded sections on each end thereof and having an intermediate section therebetween at a substantially higher elevation when in use than said end portions, said triangular prong being integral with said intermediate section and attached thereto at the base portion of said triangular prong, and said rounded ends being adapted to contact and rest in point contact with the bottom of a cooking vessel.For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of one form of the meat support according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the device of Fig. 1 as it appears prior to the semi circular formation thereof Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the device of Fig. 1 with a meat portion impaled thereon andFig. 4 is a sectional view of the device of Figs. 1 and 3 with a meat portion, taken along the line 4 4 of Fig.3.In Fig. 1 a meat support according to one embodiment of this invention is illustrated. It comprises a pair of rounded end portions 11 adapted to contact and rest in rounded point contact with the bottom 16 of a cooking pan see Fig. 3 . An integral intermediate portion 18 is located at a substantially higher elevation than the rounded end portions 11. The end portions 11 and intermediate portion 18 form a semi circular configuration having an upwardly projecting prong 12 formed from a blank 10 as illustrated in Fig. 2 and leaving therein a triangular void 17. The surface 19 of the support in Figure 1 maintains its flat surface as it existed prior to bending into semi circular form. The length of prong 12 is slightly shorter than the distance of ends 11 from the center of the support.This is important since it permits the longest possible prong and yet does not compromise the strength of support ends 11. Prong 12 is attached to the main portion or intermediate portion at the base 20 of the elongated triangle of the prong.As shown in Figure 2, the support of Figs. 1, 3 and 4 is fabricated by first forming the flat metal blank 10 having rounded ends as at 11 and then piercing the same to form pointed tang or prong 12 at right angles to blank 10. The blank 10 is then bent to semi circular form as shown at 13 in Figs. 1, 3 and 4.The rounded ends 11 of the support illustrated herein provide secure seating of the supports in the roasting pan and the number of supports employed may be varied according to the size and shape of the meat or poultry to be roasted or baked. In most cases, the number of supports will be three or four. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the holders support the meat or poultry, which is indicated fragmentarily at 14, well above the juice or gravy indicated at 15 In those figures. The interior bottom surface of the roasting pan is designated 16 inFigs. 3 and 4.The drawings show in Figs. 1, 3 and 4 the preferred support device of this invention useful in cooking meats. This device comprises a main raised support portion formed by bending the flat blank metal or non metal material 10 into a semi circular or cylindrical configuration 13. A triangular shaped prong 12 is formed that is integral with said main support portion at its base 12 in Fig.2 and extends upwardly therefrom as shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 4.The main raised support portion comprises substantially rounded end sections 11 on each end thereof and has an intermediate section therebetween at a substantially higher semi circular elevation than the end portions 11.The triangular shaped prong 12 is integral with said intermediate section, and attached thereto at its base portion, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The substantially rounded ends 11 are adapted to contact and rest in point contact with the bottom 16 of a cooking vessel as shown in Fig. 4The device of this invention as shown in the drawings thus resembles a segment of a cylinder as shown in Figs.1 and 3 having a prong projcting from the apex of said segment. The device of this invention can be bent or molded from synthetic materials ito its final segmented cylindrical form. All points on the surface of this cylinder segment are substantially equidistant from the longitudinal axis of the cylinder as shown in Fig. 3. A cylinder by definition must have a flat surface, and any segments of a cylinder will also have a flat surface as in Figs. 1 and 3.Briefly summarized, the invention provides a meat support to be used in cooking or roasting which comprises a semi circular structure, having rounded ends 11. The upper arch or raised portion 13 of the support is equidistant between the two rounded end portions 11 and comprises an upwardly directed prong 12 for piercing engagement with meat. The prong is integral with this raised intermediate portion and extends therefrom in the form of an elongate triangle with the base portion integral with said intermediate portion. The length of the prong is slightly shorter than the length of each leg portion. This permits near maximum length for the prong and provides deeper and more secure penetration into the meat or poultry. Such supports are adapted to be used in the bottom portion of a meat roast in any desired spaced arrangement.Usually three or four of these supports will be used to support all parts of the lower portion of the roast. This provides firm support for the meat above the bottom of the roasting pan and above the gravy or juice which normally collects there.One support device comprises a a main raised support portion b a triangular prong integral with said main support portion and extends upwardly therefrom. This main raised support portion comprises substantially rounded sections on each end thereof and has an intermediate section therebetween at a substantially higher semi circular elevation than said ends. The triangular prong is integral at its baste portion with said intermediate section. The substantially rounded ends are adapted to contact and rest in point contact with the bottom of a cooking vessel. The intermediate section may have a substantially planar surface wherein any point on a transverse line drawn across the width of said surface is substantially equidistant from the bottom surface of said cooking vessel.The portions of said intermediate section immediately and horizontally aacent to said prong are then substantially parallel with the said surface of said cooking vessel. This gives the meat improved support and holds it above the surface of the cooking vessel. The prong preferably has a length just slightly shorter than one half the length of said main raised support portion and extends upwardly from said main raised support portion in a substantially perpendicular manner. The projecting prong can be cut out of said main raised support portion and can be attached thereto only at its triangular base portion.Alternatively, the prong can be a separate piece that is attached to the raised support portion by welding, soldering or the like. If the material is non metallic, the entire support device with prong is preferably molded in one piece. The support device can be made from metal, synthetic materials such as plastics or fiber glass.In another embodiment the support device comprises a main raised support portion having the configuration of a segment of a cylinder. Attached to this raised portion is a triangular shaped prong extending upwardly therefrom. The main raised support portion comprises substantially rounded sections on each end of said segment. The triangular shaped prong extends upwardly from the apex of said main raised support portion and is integral therewith at its triangular base portion. The rounded ends are adapted to contact and rest in point contact with the bottom of a cooking vessel. All points on the segmented cylindrical surface of said main raised support portion are substantially equidistant from the longitudinal axis of said cylinder.The devices or supports are easily and economically manufactured. The device can be stamped or formed from a flat strip or piece of metal having rounded end portions. A prong is struck out of the center portion of this flat piece and this piece is then bent into a semi circular configuration with the two rounded end portions equidistant from the center of the piece, and the prong projecting upwardly from this mid portion. The rounded ends are adapted to rest in rounded point contact with the bottom of a cooking pan.As noted above, alternately the supports of this invention can be manufactured or molded from any suitable plastic or synthetic material having the proper physical properties. Proper temperature and inert properties are necessary for use with food. Suitable plastics materials include high density polymeric materials such as polyamides, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polycarbonatesr polyurethanes, or any other suitable polymer or plastics. The configuaration of this plastics embodiment will resemble a segment of a cylinder having a prong projecting upwardly from the highest point of said segment.Individual support devices are provided and adapted to be applied to the bottom of a cut of meat or a poultry item in any desired spacing or arrangement. Usually three or four such sport devices will be used in combination to support all parts of the roast firmly in an elevated position above the bottom of the roasting pan and above the gravy or juice which normally collects there.As support devices very simple metal stampings may be used which are readily washed and may be stored in a small space when not in use. Each support preferaby comprises a more or less semi circular strip of metal adapted to rest at its opposite ends on the bottom of the roasting pan and having a tong or prong struck upwardly therefrom medially of the semicircular stripWhile only one prong is showing in drawings and described herein, it is understood that more than one prong may be used if desired.Any suitable material may be used to make the support devices of this invention. Typical materials are aluminum, steel, nickel, copper or mixtures and alloys thereof. Any synthetic material that could be non reactive at high temperatures and non toxic could also be used if desired. Relatively inert plastics, glass silicone materials, or fiberglass could be considered if they have the proper thermal and chemical stability and non toxicity. Aluminum and prepared plastics are the preferred materials of manufacture.It is important that the terminal or end portions be rounded for proper stability when they are inserted into the meat or poultry. Generally, three or four support devices are used at one time, and the configuration of the rounded ends provides a means of maintaining the desired distance from the bottom of the cooking vessel.If th ends were squared or not rounded, the meat would not be properly supported, especially in those cases where the bottom meat surface was irregular. Using the illustrated embodiment, the pan bottom can contact any point on the circumference of the support ends, and still all of the supports used will maintain pan contact. The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described herein and shown in the accompanying drawing to illustrate the underlying principles of the invention, but it is to be understood that numerous modifications may be made without departing from the broad scope of the invention.For example, intermediate section may have a planar surface wherein any point on a transverse line drawn across the width of said surface is substantially equidistant from the bottom surface of the cooking vessel 16. The portions of the intermediate section immediately and horizontally adjacent said prong as shown in Figs. 3 would then be substantially parallel with the bottom surface 16 of said cooking vessel.
