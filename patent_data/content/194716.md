# Addition of phosphines to alpha olefins.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved process for the addition of phospines to alpha olefins at high yields and conversions. The process involves the absence of a catalyst whose residues could interfere with the utility of the product, such as n hexyldiphenylphosphine, as a ligand. Simple thermal reaction is used at temperatures of at least 200 C., most preferably 250 C 350 C. The pressure is preferably at least atmospheric. Preferred reactants, products, and processing conditions are also disclosed. Batch processes are exempli fied and continuous processes proposed.
