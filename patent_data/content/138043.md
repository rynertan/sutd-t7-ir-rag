# Scale assembly with improved platform.

## Abstract
A scale assembly includes a plurality of force mea suring transducers which are connected with an improved platform. The platform has an upper portion which with stands compressive stresses and a lower portion which withstands tensile stresses during the weighing of a load. The upper portion of the platform includes a body of con crete having a corrugated lower major side and a flat upper major side which receives a load to be weighed. The lower portion of the platform includes a metal structure having a plurality of elongated ribs which are disposed in abutting engagement with the corrugated lower major side of the body of concrete. The ribs are connected with a bottom plate which cooperates with the ribs to form elongated cavities. At least a major portion of each of the cavities is disposed within the spatial envelope of the body of concrete to mini mize the mass of the concrete. During the weighing of a load, the concrete is subjected to compressive stresses and the bottom plate and ribs are subjected to tensile stresses.
