# Silicon wafers for integrated circuit chip fabrication.

## Abstract
Warpage of silicon wafers, due to heat cycle processing for bipolar wafers, is minimized by selecting wafer thicknesses in accordance with a special, substantially linear plot of wafer thicknesses as a function of wafer diameter. Selection of wafer thickness, in accordance with the present invention, also enhances leakage limited yield of the processed wafers and eliminates the need for oxygen screening of the wafers.

## Description
SILICON WAFERS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CHIP FABRICATIONThis invention generally relates to silicon wafer heat cycle processing for bipolar transistors and, more particularly to the selection of wafer parameters for the minimization of warpage resulting from said processing.It is generally recognized that the warpage of silicon wafers, after being subjected to elevated temperature processing such as in the manufacture of bipolar transistor integrated circuits, is to be avoided to the extent possible so that photolithography related steps may be carried out with the greatest precision and reproducibility for maximum component density and yield. One approach to the minimization of warpage has focused upon the relationship between warpage and the oxygen concentration in the silicon wafer. U.S. Patent 4,017,341 issued in the name of Takaya Suzuki, et al.on April 12, 1977, for example, discloses a passivation film method to prevent the diffusion or penetration of oxygen into polycrystalline portions of a wafer to reduce warpage. A related technique is to test and screen all incoming single crystal wafers to meet stringent oxygen concentration specifications before the wafers are accepted for heat processing. It is desirable, of course, that a way be found to solve the warpage problem without resort to such costly special precautions to monitor wafer oxygen concentration.It has also been known that there is a relationship between silicon wafer diameter, thickness and propensity to deflection when subjected to measured loads .In a paper Semiconductor Wafer Flatness and Warpage by F. Y. Chui et al., presented at the November 15 17, 1976 annual meeting of the Materials Research Society of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a number of plotted data points deflection versus wafer thickness were presented for different diameter wafers, including 32.5 mm, 57 mm, 76 mm, 82.5 mm, 102 mm, and 128 mm wafers, subjected to loads of known weight. The data showed that the thicker the wafer, the less deflection. One might surmise from such data that a straightforward answer to the silicon wafer warpage problem is simply to increase wafer thickness until acceptably small warpage is achieved. However, arbitrary increases in wafer thickness not only is costly in terms of wasteful silicon usage but also may give rise to yield and other problems.Current industry standards, reported by the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute, Inc., specify a thickness of 254 to 305 ssm for 50 mm wafers, 365 to 417 ssm for 75 mm diameter wafers, 381 to 432 gm for 80 mm wafers, 457 to 508 ijm for 90 mm wafers, 508 to 559 or 610 to 660 ssm for 100 mm wafers, 610 to 660 Wm for 125 mm wafers and 660 to 711 ssm for 150 mm wafers.When using the specified thicknesses, it generally has been found necessary to carefully control or screen the silicon wafers to assure oxygen content in order to avoid objectionable wafer warpage after exposure to the elevated temperature cycling, of about 10000C, associated with bipolar transistor processing. The testing, sorting and rejection of considerable portions of each silicon crystal ingot or the careful control of the crystal growth process as are required to meet such oxygen content specifications are costly procedures which should he eliminated wherever possible. The invention as claimed is intended to remedy these drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to optimally reduce silicon wafer warpage.In summary, silicon wafers in excess of 50 mm in diameter and other than 100 mm in diameter, having a thickness in the range of substantially 25 Cim centered about the values lying along the plot of Fig. 3, are used optimally to reduce wafer warpage as a result of wafer exposure to high temperature cycles of about 10000C which are associated with bipolar transistor fabrication processing. The higher limit of the aforesaid range also enhances the leakage limited yield of the processed wafers. The use of the thickness range eliminates the need for oxygen screening.The invention is described in detail with reference to drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plot of leakage limited yield and warpage data obtained after completion of high temperature heat cycling of 82.5 mm diameter wafers of different thicknesses Fig. 2 is a plot of warpage data obtained after completion of heat cycling of 125 mm dia meter wafers of different thicknesses Fig. 3 is a superimposed plot of optimum wafer thickness versus wafer diameter, in accordance with the present invention and wafer thickness versus wafer diameter as practiced in the prior art and Fig. 4 is a plot of warpage spread data after completion of heat cycling for wafers of the same thickness having each of three different diameters.It has been found that at the conventional thickness of 400 corm, wafers of 82.5 mm diameter having moderatelv high 30 PPM oxygen content warped and experienced low leakage limited yield after completion of the heat processing steps encountered in bipolar transistor integrated circuit processing. In order to avoid such undesirable results, resort has been had to crystal cropping and wafer sorting to meet strict oxygen content limits with concomitant loss of up to 50 of raw crystal ingot material.In contrast with the industry practice, we have discovered that there is an optimum thickness for the 82.5 mm wafer and optimum thicknesses as well for other diameter wafers of approximately 533 ssm. This optimum thickness is true for wafers derived from the seed end and tail end as well as from the main body of silicon crystal ingots. Use of the optimum thickness was found to maximize leakage limited yield and to minimize wafer warpage at the completion of the heat processing of bipolar integrated circuit chips.More particularly, a number of silicon wafers of different thicknesses but of the same 82.5 mm diameter were subjected to the temperature time cycles of stateof the art bipolar integrated circuit chip processing.The results are shown in Fig. 1. Curve 1 represents the leakage limited yield experienced with wafers having thicknesses of 330, 381, 457, 533 and 584 ssm. Warpage of the same wafers is represented by curve 2. It will be noted that a maximum in curve 1 coincides with a minimum in curve 2 at the 533 ssm wafer thickness.Similar tests were run using 125 mm diameter silicon wafers of various thicknesses which were subjected to extreme conditions of 16 hour treatment at 10000C followed by rapid cooling. Two sets of data were taken and plotted in Fig. 2, one set solid line curves 2 and 3 representing wafer warpage prior to heat exposure and the other set dashed line curves 2 and 3 representing wafer warpage subsequent to heating. The net warpage the distance between the solid and dashed lines due to heat treatment can be seen to reduce substantially to zero for wafers having thicknesses larger than 762 to 889 ssm. A simple, linear proportionality is believed to exist between optimum wafer thickness and wafer diameter, despite industry practice to minimize warpage seemingly to the contrary. As evidence of this, the plot ofFig. 3 has been prepared, using the above described data obtained from the 82.5 mm and 125 mm wafer diameter tests, together with data points representing preexisting 31,75 and 57,15 mm diameter product wafers and representing one of two industry standard 102 mm diameter wafers, having thicknesses of 203, 381 and 635 ssm, respectively. It readily can be observed from the plot of Fig. 3, that all of the optimum wafer thickness points, in accordance with the present invention, lie along the same straight line. This is in contrast with the prior art industry practice, represented by the curved plot, having generally lower wafer thickness values for given wafer diameter values. To avoid the need for wafer oxygen content monitoring to control warpage, as practiced in the art where 406 ssm thick wafers of 82.5 mm diameter and 610 ijm thick wafers of 125 mm diameter are used, wafer thick nesses of 533 ssm and 813 Am, respectively, should be selected as shown in Fig. 3. It is understood that each of the thickness data points of Fig. 3 are subject to the normal wafer processing tolerance of 25 ssm. Fig. 4 is a plot of warpage spread data obtained from a number of wafers of the same 622 ssm thickness having the indicated three different diameters of 82, 100 and 125 mm, respectively, after bipolar processing heat treatment. Plots 4, 5 and 6 represent 112, 39 and 82 wafers, respectively. The warpage spreads represented by the vertical lengths of the plots are good measures of warpage control and show a minimum when the devia tion from the optimum thickness of Fig. 3 also is at a minimum. This is the case of the 100 mm diameter wafers whose thickness of 622 ssm deviates only 4 from the optimum thickness of 645 ssm. The thickness deviations from the optimums of the 82.5 mm and 125 mm diameter wafers are 17 and 23 , respectively. Thus, when the wafer thickness is either two thin or too thick from the optimum thickness, the resulting warpage violates the warpage specification more frequently. The most significant advantage of the optimum thickness discovery of the present invention is that it permits relief from the hazards of marginal wafer processing as when special processing conditions are relied upon to permit the use of wafers of non optimum thickness. When optimum thickness is employed, the wafer is virtually immune to most conditions that produce warpage. Oxygen screening can be eliminated and other productivity enhancements can be realized.
