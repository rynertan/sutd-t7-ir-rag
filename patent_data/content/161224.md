# Process for copper chloride aqueous electrolysis.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a new procedure for electro winning copper out from copper chloride aqueous solution electrolysis, wherein the use of an electrolysts cell is provided for, where the anodic and cathodic compartments, and the corresponding electrolytes, are separated by a cation per moselective membrane, and the liquid currents feeding both electrolytes 29, 31 have different composition, being the catholyte 29 a solution of copper and sodium chlorides as well as hydrochloric acid, and the anolyte 31 an alkaline chloride solution, preferably a sodium chloride one.
