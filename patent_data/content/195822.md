# CONVERTER DEVICE.

## Abstract
A converter device equipped with smoothing capacitors 2a , 2b that are connected in series on the d c side. Any imbalance of voltage across terminals of the smoothing capacitors is detected relying upon an electric current that flows in or out through a connection point Q of the smoothing capacitors 2a , 2b . A dummy resistance 10 is connected in parallel with the smoothing capacitor 2a on the side where no load is connected, and imbalance of voltage is eliminated permitting only a little power loss.
