# Molding composition.

## Abstract
A moulding composition is a blend of polybutylene terephthalate PBT with a segmented thermoplastic copolyester elastomer. The elastomer contains recurring polymeric long chain ester units derived from phthalic acids and long chain diols, together with short chain ester units derived from phthalic acids and a mixture of diols. This mixture contains 1,4 butane diol and 1,4 butene diol. Inclusion of the latter leads to superior melt stability.
