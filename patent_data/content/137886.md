# Floating device for raising the anchor of small boats.

## Abstract
Device for raising the anchor of small boats which uses the traction of the motor since it consists of a float 1 crossed with a tube so as to act as a pulley, inside of which slides the line 3, raising the weight of the anchor 4, until it makes contact with the float 1 itself, which partially sinks to show that the anchor is being recovered, with the boat stopped or at low speeds.

## Claims
Claims 1. Device for raising the anchors of small craft consisting of a float 1 equipped with a tubular cavity 2, through which the line 3 of the anchor 4 passes, to be attached to the stern of the craft so that said float 1 acts. as pulley for sliding the line 3, pulled by the moving craft. 2. Device for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the fact that said float ss has a flotation power slightly greater than the weight of the anchor 4 so that it partially sinks when said anchor 4 has reached the bottom of sad float, indicating that the anchor has been raised. 3. Device for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the fact that the taught line 3 and the line 3 float I combination form a rigid arm which, under the combined effect the. raising power provided by the pull of the craft and the flotation power of the float 1, causes the line 3 float 1 combination to come out of the water, for manual recovery. 4. Device for anchor raising according to claim I characterized by the fact that the anchor 4, once the craft stones, does not fall again to the bottom because the line 3 is held by the tubular cavity of the float 1 at 90 with respect to the anchor 4, leading to strong friction on the upper edge of said cavity. 5. Device. for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the presence of cylindrical float. 6. Device for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the presence af a spherical float. 7. Device for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the presence of a float consisting of two cones joined at their large ends. 8. Device for anchor raising according to claim 1 characterized by the presence of a float consisting of a cone with the large end up, connected to an upper cylindrical part.

## Description
Floating device for raising the anchor of small boatsThe invention concerns a device for raising the anchor of small boats using a float to function as a pulley inside which the line moves.It is well known that boats and small craft in general use as anchor a weight which is sufficient to prevent movement of the boat. In fact, traditional anchors, when cast among shoals and bottom irregularities, very often becomes caught and can no longer be recovered, while weights are much more practical, in terms of the certain recoverability as well.However, said weithts cannot be raised from the bottom with windlasses of any .type since these are not used in small craft. Therefore, raising the anchor reguires not insignificant physical effort since it must be done manually.The aim of this invention is the rapid and simple raising of the anchor, with an economic, non cumbersome device.This aim is achieved with the device according to the invention consisting of a float of any shape equipped with a preferably cylindrical cavity with a hole through which the anchor line runs to be attached to the stern of the craft in such a way that when the boat starts, its.motor pulls the line while the fRzoat , held by the water flow, remains in place, making the line slide through the catty and so raising the anchor.Another characteristic of the invention consists of the fact that said float has a flotation power slightly greater than the weight of the anchor, for example on the order of a kilogram, so that when the anchor has been raised and has reached the bottom of the float, it partially sinks under the effect of the pull of the motor and the weight of the anchor itself, showing the user that it has been completely raised.Under these conditions then a rigid arm is formed consisting of the taught line and the line float combination which under the combined effect of the raising power from the pull of the boat and the flotation power of the float, comes out of the water to be trailed. by the craft itself.At this point the anchor is raised and the craft need only be stopped or slowed down to complete the recovery of the line float anchor combination.The invention is shown in some exemplificative and son limiting forms in the attached figures which show Fig. 1, a variant with an approximately cylindrical float fig. 2, a float consisting of two cones joined at the large ends fig. 3, a cone shaped float with the large end up, joined to an upper cylindrical portion fig. 4, a spherical float.The figures show in detail the float 1, of any size and shape, crossed by tubular opening 2 where the line 3 is inserted, connected at its bottom end to the weight or anchor 4, and connected at the other end to the stern of the craft. It is obvious that the functionality of the invention consists of the fact that the float 1 acts as a puliey through which the line 3 runs, pulled by the craft rather than the userFurthermore, once the craft stops, the anchor should start to fall towerd the bottom just by its own weight, in the reverse operation to that described above, however this does not occur because the position of the line 3 at 90 with respect to the anchor 4 gives rise to strong friction at the edge of the tubular opening 2 and because of the presence of a negative static pull from the weight of the raised line the pull of the man in the craft adds to the latter to recover the combination. Of course, while the principle of the finding reamins the same, the realization forms and the details of constr.uction may be varied widely with respect to that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention.
