# Beam access apparatus for optical disc system.

## Abstract
A beam access apparatus for an optical disc system includes an objective lens 55 whose position is detected in a tracking direction with respect to an optical base in an optical head 1 . In a head access mode, the objective lens 55 is positioned and fixed at a prescribed position in the optical head 1 to suppress damping vibrations to enable the head to be accessed at a high speed. In a lens access mode and a track follow mode subsequent to the head access mode, the controlling position for the optical head 1 is such that the objective lens 55 is arranged at a prescribed position in the optical head 1 to enable a track to be followed precisely by a light spot and track jumping of the light spot to be reliably carried out by driving the objective lens.
