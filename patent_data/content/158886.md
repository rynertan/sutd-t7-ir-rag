# A torsion angle detection circuit.

## Abstract
An actuator in which, when the reduction ratio of a re duction gear unit 1 is 1 N, the number PPR₂ of pulses of a second encoder E₂ is set to be equal to N times the num ber PPR₁ of pulses of a first encoder E₁ , whereby a pulse processing circuit for detecting a torsion angle is made re markably simple.
