## Description
Portable electronic video recording system. The invention relates to a portable electronic video recording system comprising a portable electronic camera switching means for switching the power supply voltage on and off and for controlling the various functions of the system, which means comprise stand by switching means for switching on and switching off the electric power supply to other switching means so that the system is ready for making a recording, and recording switching means for controlling the recordingfunction of the system after the stand by switching means have been switched on a portable recorder for recording picture signals supplied by the camera on a recording medium a case having a recorder compartment for carrying the recorder and provided with carrying means and transmission means for the transmission of signals and, if desired, the power supply voltage between the camera and the system parts in the case, which parts comprise at least the recorder and may comprise a voltage source. Portable electronic video recording systems of the above type are marketed by several manufactures and form an alternative to cine cameras. Until now, however, their use has apparentlyJbeen limited by the comparatively high cost of such a video recording system and the comparatively weight of portable recorders.This is mainly due to the fact that the portable recorders available practically always belong to one of the three current video recorder systems, namely VHS, BETAX or V20000 So far attemps have been made by various recorder manufacturers to use cassettes of smaller dimensions which are compatible with recorders belonging to one of these systems, enabling the dimensions and weight of the portable recorders to be reduced, The smaller cassettes can be played on the normal video recorders belonging to the system by using an adapter. Currently, attempts are also being made to arrive at a globally accepted video recorder standard employing a standard cassette which in comparison with the cassettes of the preeent systems has substantially smaller dimensions.This would in particular promote the use of portable video recording systems. It has ready been proposed from various sides to incorporate the recorders in the cameras, resulting in electronic video recording systems which resemble the well known cine cameras emp7Ov ng easily and rapidly exchangeable film cassettes. However, the incprporatfon of the recorder in the camera has several drawbacks. Firstly, a deck equipped with a rotary magnetic head drum and a drive mechanism for the transport of the magnetic tape past the rotary head drum can never be as small and as light as the deck of a cinecamera. Even if a small cassette is used the recorder will have a comparatively high weight, Another problem is the power supply of the tape deck and the electronic cir cuiin in the camera. For various reasons the power consumpt ion per unit of time of a portable electronic camera with built in deck is substantially higher than that of a cinecamera. In addition film cassettes can contain a recording lasting a maximum of 32 minutes, whereas for video cassettes a maximum duration of the order of 1 hour is envisaged.Therefore, it will be necessary to incorporate a comparatively bulky and heavy power source in the electronic camera. In view of this it is envisaged that a portable electronic video recording system comprising a camera with built in tape deck will have a substantially higher weight than the current cine camera, many types of such cameras being already considered too heavy by the consumer. The invention provides a portable electronic video recording system of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph, which is suitable for use in conjunction with a small video cassette and is characterized in that the case has a camera compartment for accommodating and carrying the camera if the transmission means comprise connecting means for establishing a connection between the camera and the system parts contained in the case tslese connecting means with readily allow the camera to be placed in the camera compartment, to be carried therein and to be removed therefrom whilst said connection is maintained and, after said connecting means, if present, have been connected to establish said connection, and after the stand by switching means have been switched on while the camera is still in the camera compartment of the case to start the recording it is necessary only to remove the camera from the case and to actuate the recording switching means. The invention ingeniously utilizes the fact that it is always useful to have an everready case at hand when using a camera. Such cases are generally used with cine cameras and allow the camera to be stored safely and to be carried conveniently after an exposure has been made.This may also be desirable with electronic cameras.Therefore, the basic concept of the present invention is to gain advantage from the necessity of having to carry an everready case by accommodating at least the recorder and, if desired, other parts of the video recording system in the everready case, so that the weight can be divided in a logical manner between the camera and the everready case. In this respect it must be borne in mind that in general it will be desirable to minimise the weight of the camera, which has to be supported by the use and held to the eye in use. It is less tiring to carry an object of substantial weight in a case provided with ashoulder strap than in the hand, particularly when the hand is to be held roughly at shoulder level.The steps in accordance with the invention lead to a more convenient distribution of the weight of the video recording system between the everready case and the camera, while retaining the desired functions of the system. Within the scope of tbe invention several embodiments are possible0 It is possible to accommodate a power source for both the video recorder and the camera in the everready case. However, it is also possible to accommodate a separate power source for the camera in the camera itself, and in principle it is even possible to accommodate the power source for the video recorder in the camera, although this seems to be less desirable in view of the appropriate distribution of weight between the camera and the everready case. Obviously the camera and the cassette recorder should be interconnected for the transmission of signals between them, such as audio and video signals and command signals. A first embodiment of the invention, in which the camera and the video recorder are interconnected by means of a flexible cable comprising at least one core for the transmission of wide band information signals, has the advantage that the cable can be comparatively thin and flexible, and is characterized in that said core comprises an optical fibre, the camera is equipped with an optical transmitter comprising a radiation source and modulation means for modulating the intensity of the radiation emitted by the radiation source with the wide band information and the case contains an optical receiver which comprises a radiation sensitive electronic element for converting the radiation modlllation into an electrical modulation. The principal advantage of the use of an optical fibre is that it combines a large capacity for the transmission of signals with a small diameter and a high flexibility, an additional advantage being that the fibre need not be shielded from extraneous electromagnetic fields. A further embodiment aims at minimising the inconvenience of the presence of a cable between the camera and the everready case and is characterized in that the case contains an automatic cable winder which comprises a rotatable drum for taking up and unwinding the cable, a drive means for driving the drum during take up and a locking device for locking the drum when tile cable is fully or partly unwound. Such cable winders are known in a variety of versions and are, for example, frequently used in domestic appliances, particularly in vacuum cleaners. The drive means for driving the drum generally comprises a simple spring motor whose spring is wound when the cable is pulled out. Therefore, no electric driving power is required because the energy required for taking up the cable is supplied by the user of the apparatus when the pulls out the cable. It may also be advantageous to use an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that the transmission means comprise wireless transmission means for the wireless transmission of signals between the camera and the system parts in the case, which means comprise at least one transmitter and one receiver. The wireless transmission of signals between the camera and the system parts in the case permits the use of an even thinner and more flexible cable between the camera and the everready case, lihen the camera is provided with a separate power source, the cable may even be dispensed with altogether.If the case is provided with a shoulder strap an embodiment of the invention may be utilised which is characterized in that the shoulder strap carries aerial means for the wireless transmission means, which aerial means are connected to the system parts in the case. The carrying strap is eminently suitable for this additional function and moreover it is situated close to the camera. A major advantage of the video recording system in accordance with the invention, in which the camera can be accommodated in an everready case which contains the video recorder and other parts belonging to the video recording system, is that embodiments may be used which are characterized in that the system, when the camera is in tile case, can be used as a stationary picture reproducing system that can be placed on a table top for reproducing video signals previously recorded on the recording medium, and for this purpose the system comprises a picture screen, means for reading the video signals on the recording medium and reproducing them on the picture screen, means for carrying out at least the fast reverse and play functions of the recorder and switching means for controlling these functions. An electronic camera having a built in video recorder and equipped with an electronic viewfinder may also be used as picture,reproducing system, but this would also require the system to be held up to the eye, which is generally considered to be an unnatural and fatiguing position for the arms, particularly when the system is not used for recording. The invention provides a video recording system which, when used for picture reproducing can be placed on a table top and then operates in the same way as the customary picture reproducing systems. It may then be advantageous touse an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that the system comprises supporting means which are capable of supporting the case on a table top in an oblique position relative to the table top.In the oblique position of the case the picture screen should be disposed substantially perpendicularly to the line of sight of person sitting at the table and looking at the screen. Moreover, if the case is substantially of box form and comprises two major walls interconnected by side walls, it may be advantageous to use an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that the supporting means are arranged on a major wall so as to be movable between a rest position and a supporting position and in the supporting position can support the case in said oblique position on a table top with the said major walls facing the table top. In electronic cameras equipped with an electronic viewfinder the camera comprises a built in picture screen which may be used for displaying pictures recorded on the recording medium. An embodiment of the invention is characterized in that during use of the system as a stationary picture reproducing system 1 the built in picture screen on the camera can be viewed from outside the case and 2 via the transmission means the picture signals can be transmitted from the recorder to the built in picture screen of the camera, so that this built in picture screen can be used for reproducing the video signals previously recorded on the recording medium. Also when the camera is contained in the everready case, the built in screen in this embodiment can be viewed from outside the case, whilst moreover the transmission means between the camera and the video recorder carry out at least part of their function when the camera is situated in the case. A drawback of the use of the built in picture screen on the camera may be that for satisfactory viewing the screen has to be viewed through the eyepiece, with only a small distance between eye and eyepiece.Therefore, it is advantageous to use an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that the system comprises an optical magnifier which can be carried in the case, for magnifying the picture on the built in picture screen on the camera when the system is used as a stationary picturereproducing system0 Thus, the built in picture screen can be viewed from a greater distances It may be advantageous to use an embodiment which is characterized in that the case has a wall with an aperture through which the builtin picture screen on the camera can be viewed when the system is used as a stationary picture reproducing, and an optical magnifier is arranged in said aperture. Generally, portable electronic video recording systems are equipped with a microphone and the recorder is adapted to record the audio signals from the microphone on the recording medium. This enables the sound to be recorded in synchronism with the pictures during video recording. However, a more ambitious amateur will also require a facility for asynchronous sound recording, for example in order to introduce a video programme and to provide it with an explanatory text about the location of recording, the precise facts on the events recorded, the names of persons occurring in the recording, etc. An embodiment of a video recording system in accordance wçith the invention which, like tile embodiments already described, can also be used at a stationary picture reproducing system, is characterized in that the system, when used as a stationary picture reproducing system, is capable of reproducing sound signals recorded on the recording medium and comprises a loudspeaker and means for reading and, via the loudspeaker, reproducing the audio signals recorded on the recording medium. Thus, immediately after recording the user can monitor not only the picture but also the accompanying sound.This not only provides more satisfaction than merely displaying the picture, as is customary in known video recording systems with a playback facility, but it also enables the user to check immediately after recording whether and to what extent an explanatory text is required and to collect the necessary data at the relevant location immediately after the recording. It may be advantageous to utilise an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that the loudspeaker is accommodated in the case and in that switching means are provided for switching on and off the loudspeaker independently of other functions and control means are provided for controlling the level of sound produced by the loudspeaker.In this embodiment the everready case is also employed as a loudspeaker enclosure and the audio amplifier is equipped with the customary controls In view of the foregoing it is interesting, if the camera is equipped with a microphone for recording audio signals in synchronism with the video signals, to use an embodiment of the invention which is characterized in that during use as a stationary picture reproducing system the system is capable of asynchronous addition of sound to the recorded pictures, for which purpose lo the microphone can intercept sound,from outside the case and 2o audio signals from the microphone can be transmitted to the recorder via the transmission means and the system comprises means for recording the audio signals during reproduction of the video signals. This embodiment of the invention permits the asynchronous addition of the desired audio information to the recorded pictures and sound via the microphone associated with the camera immediately after recording and after collecting the required data. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawingss in which Fig. 1 is a side view of a system in accordance with the invention, carried by a user, Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing the camera with the grip folded in and showing the case with the cover and carrying strap removed. Fig0 3 is a perspective view of the system when used as a stationary reproducing system, Fig. 4 is a perspective side view of a slightly different embodiment of the invention, and Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the system shown in Fig. 4 when used as a stationary picture reproducing system with the camera placed in the case, the picture being viewed via a lens in the wall of the case. The portable electronic video recording system shown in Fig. 1 comprises a portable electronic camera 1 and a magnetic video recorder 3 which can be carried by means of a shoulder strap 2. This video recorder is adapted to cooperate with magnetic tape cassettes which can be inserted into and removed from the recorder via a cassette holder 4. Since electronic cameras and video caseette recorders are generally known the camera 1 and recorder 3 are not shown in more detail. The video recorder 3 is accommodated in a case 5 having a recorder compartment 6 for containing the recorder. On one side of the case 5 a control panel 7 is located, which panel carries a number of controls for the video recorder, such as pushbuttons 8.This panel may also carry push buttons 9 for actuating switching means not shown but of conventional type for switching the electric power supply on and off and for controlling the various functions of the system.These switching means include stand by switching means for switching on or switching off the electric power supply to other switching means, for example for starting the motors of the video cassette recorder and the associated electronic circuitry in order to prepare the system for making a recording0 The case 5 also contains a power source in the form of a number of batteries 10. The batteries may alternatively be located outside the case, in known manner, for example in a belt or in a separate unit which can be attached to the outside of the case. The camera 1 comprises a separate power source, for example also in the form of batteries. This is not shown in the drawing but is known per se. The camera is provided with a grip 11 and a push button 12 for actuating the recording switching means for controlling the recording function of the system after the said stand by switching means have been switched on. The various switching means which may be used are not shown in detail. For a description reference is made to, for example, German Offenlegungsschrift 30 43 041 herewith incorporated by reference . On the upper side the camera 1 is provided with a number of buttons 13, one of which may serve for example for switching on the power supply to the electrical circuitry in the camera. For making a recording it is necessaryswhen a camera is equipped with a built in electronic viewfinder, that the viewfinder picture is visible and all circuits in the camera are ready to supply picture signals to the video recorder 3 when the recording button 12 is pressed.The video recorder must be ready to transport the magnetic tape and to record the video and generally also the audio signals supplied by the camera when the recording button of the camera is actuate It is therefore necessary that in addition to video and audio signals, command signals can be transmitted from the camera to the video recorder.Moreover, when the video recorder records videa and audio signals it is desirable that this is signalled to the camera, so that the user can see that recording is actually taking place when the button 12 is pressed. In accordance with the invention the case 5 not only serves for carrying the video recorder but also serves as an everready case for carrying thicamera 1 in a camera compartment 14 provided in the case. In order that the camera shall be ready for making recordings immediately it has been taken out of the camera compart ment of the case, it is necessary that the connecting means in the form of a cable or the like, which establish a connection between the camera 1 and the system parts situated in the case and whicgare incorporated in the transmission means, will, if present, readily allow the camera to be placed in the camera compartment, to be carried therein and to be removed therefrom while said connection is maintained.In the embodiment shown in igs. 1 to 3 no connecting cable is used. An embodiment of a video recording system in which a connection is proved by a cable between the camera and the system parts in the case is shown in Figs. 4 and 5. It will be necessary to connect this cable previously to the camera and the system parts in the case, for example by means of conventional connectors, and to actuate the stand by switching means in advance if it is desired that for making a recording it is necessary only to take the camera out of the case and to actuate the recording switching means. Figs. 4 and 5 show a portable electronic video recording system which closely resembles but in some respects differs from the video recording system shown in Figs. 1 to 3.It comprises an electronic camera 101, a video recorder 103 with a cassette holder 104 and a carrying case 105 with a recorder compartment 106, a carrying strap 102 and a camera compartment 114 for the camera 1010 The camera compartment can be closed by means of two hinged covers 115. A control panel 107 carries controls 108 for the video recorder. A number of batteries 110, both for the power supply of the video recorder and of the camera are located in the case. The camera 101 is connected to system parts contained in the case 105 by connecting means, which are incorporated in the transmisxion means, in the form of a flexible cable 116 which is suitable both for transmitting the supply voltage to the camera and for transmitting video, audio and other signals between the camera and the case. At least one of the cores of the cable comprises optical fibre. This is not shown in more detail. The optical fibre is incorporated in the cable in known manner amongst metal current conductors and serves for transmitting wide band information signals, i.e. primarily the video and audio signals.The camera is provided with an optical transmitter 117, shown symbolically in Fig. 4, which is at least suitable for converting an electrical modulation into a modulation of the intensity of the radiation emitted by a radiation source and to couple the modulated radiation into the optical fibre. The case accommodates an optical receiver, symbolically represented by the rectangle 118, which receiver, in conventional manner, comprises a radiation sensitive electronic element such as a photodiode for converting the modulation of the light beam emerging from the optical fibre into an electrical modulation. The case 105 contains an automatic cable winder 119 comprising a rotatable drum 120 for taking up and unwinding the cable 116. A drive means 121 comprises a wound spring, not shown, for driving the drum 120 during take up. There is also provided a locking device, not shown, for locking the drum when the cable is fully or partly unwound. The cable winder is not shown in full detail but may be of a known type such as is frequently used in, for example, vacuum cleaners and small domestic appliances. A suitable cable winder is described in, for example, United States Patent Specification 3,372,887 herewith incorporated by reference . In the portable electronic video recording system shown in Figs. 1 to 3 the camera is equipped with separate batteries, so that it is not necessary to supply electric power from the case to the camera. For the transmission of the signals between the camera and the system parts in the case, wireless transmssion means are used. A freely suspended aerial wire 15 is connected to the camera 1 and an aerial module 16, attached to the strap 2, is connected to the case by a cable 17. The wireless transmission between aerial 15 and module 16 is symbolically represented by the arrow 18. The wireless transmission of the signals between the aerial 15 and the module 16 is effected by means of electromagnetic waves.In principle, a modification is possible such that wireless signal transmission is effected by means of infra red radiation. A tranceiver module may then be attached to the carrying strap 2 near the user s shoulder at a location close to the camera.The camera also is provided with a tranceiver unit which, when the camera is hold up to the eye, is directed at the module on the carrying strap. This has the advantage that a maximum signal to noise ratio is obtained. then the camera is placed in the case, both the system shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and the system shown inFigs. 4 and 5 can be used as a stationary picture reproducing system which can be placed on a table top for the reproduction of the video signals previously recorded on the magnetic tape. The camera 1 equipped with a picture screen 19 which during recording can be viewed through a removable eyepiece 20. The camera 101 has a similar builtin picture screen. Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 show the situation in which the systems may be used as stationary picturereproducing systems. In Fig. 3 the camera 1, with grip 11 folded in, is placed in the case, the case being provided with a wall portion 21 which supports the camera in this position.If desired, special provisions may be made, such as ridges or clamping members, which ensure that the camera remains in place in the case. In this position the picture screen 19 can be viewed from outside the case. The aerial 1 is disposed in the case, where it cooperates with wireless transmission means in the case for the wireless transmission of signals between the camera and the system parts in the case. The video recorder 3 comprises known means for reading and reproducing the video signals recorded on the magnetic tape and all the means necessary for fast rewinding of the magnetic tape in the cassette and subsequently playing back said tape at the correct playing speed. The various functions can be controlled with the buttons 8, which in their turn actuate the necessary switching means for controlling the said functions. Supporting means in the form of a collapsible supporting bracket 22 support the case 5 on a supporting surface such as a table top in such a manner that the picture screen extends substantially perpendicularly to the line of sight of a person sitting at the table and viewing the screen 19. Instead of the screen 19 in the camera a separate screen may be provided in the case. This is necessary if the camera is provided with an optical viewfinder instead of an electronic viewfinder. In the system shown in Figs. 4 and 5 the camera is positioned differently in the case 105, namely in such a way that when the system is used as a stationary picture reproducing system the picture on the built in picture screen of the camera can be viewed from outside the case via an optical magnifier in the form of a rectangular lens 122 mounted in an aperture in a side wall 123 of the case. Alternatively, an optical magnifier may be accommodated elsewhere in the case and may be swung out, set up or otherlfise positioned at a correct location relative to the screen in order to obtain the desired magnification of the picture, when desired. The system shown in Figs. 1 to 3 comprises a microphone 23 which is pivotally mounted on top of the camera. The video recorder 3 is adapted to record the audio signals from the microphone on the magnetic tape in synchronism with the video signals. During use as a stationary picture reproducing system, see Fig. 3, the system is suitable for playing back the audio signals previously recorded on the magnetic tape and for this purpose it is provided with a loudspeaker 24 in he case 5 and the necessary electronic means for reading and, via the loudspeaker 24, reproducing the audio signals on the magnetic tape. Independently of other functions the loudspeaker can be switched on and off by means of a pushbutton 25, whilst in addition there is provided a slide potentiometer with a slide knob 26 for controlling the sound level. The system is also capable of asynchronous addition of sound to the previously recorded pictures during reproduction of the pictures. As is shown in Fig. 3, the sound can reach the microphone 23 from outside the case. Via the previously mentioned wireless transmission means the sound signals received by the microphone during picture reproduction can be transmitted to the recorder 3 and can be recorded on the tape by the means provided for this purpose during reproduction of the picture signals. Within the scope of the inventionts defined by the Claims many other embodiments of the invention are possible. The recorder need not be a magnetic tape cassette recorder but may be, for example, an optical or magnetic disc recorder. The recorder will always be accommodated in the case, at least during use as a portable video recording system the case also serves as an everready case for the camera and the system can be set to stand by in such a way that for making a recording it is necessary only to take the camera out of the case and to press the recording button0 The case may be provided with a built in picture screen such as the cathode ray tube or a liquid crystal array. The built in picture screen may be used during operation of the system as a stationary picture reproducing system but may also be employed during recording, in particular when the camera has a remote control facility.
