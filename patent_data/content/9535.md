# Spinning apparatus for nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, and spectrometer incorporating this spinning apparatus.

## Abstract
A sample 70 to be spun during NMR spectrometric analysis is placed in a chamber formed between a body member 52 and a sleeve 58 . The sleeve 58 is displaceable relative to the body member 52 to allow the sample 70 to be readily inserted or removed. The chamber has a gas flow path 68 through it for forming a gas bearing on which the sample 70 is rotated by the gas. The spin axis 80 interesects the longitudinal axis of the body member 52 . The spinning apparatus can be pulled out from, and rotated in, the spec trometer.
