# Method for making antifouling coating composition.

## Abstract
A solution containing hydrolyzed organotin siloxane polymeric material is formed by hydrolyzing an organotin R oxy siloxane in a water miscible solvent R being an alkyl or alkoxyalkyl group with less than six carbon atoms. A water immiscible solvent is added and the water miscible solvent and R alcohol from hydrolysis are removed by distillation. A marine antifouling coating can be made when the water immiscible solvent evaporates from the solution. A preferred embodiment hydrolyzes tributyltin ethoxy siloxane in ethyl alcohol with xylene as the water immiscible solvent.
