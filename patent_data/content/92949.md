# Leaf spring assemblies.

## Abstract
A spring leaf 1 of composite fibre reinforced synthetic resin material has an attachment member 5 secured at an end 2 thereof by means of at least one clamping band 12, 13 which fits about the end of the spring leaf and an extension portion 7, 8 of the attachment member to clamp them together. In one form the attachment member is an eye end with opposed flanges 7, 8 which lie on the spring leaf and each of which is clamped to the leaf by a clamping band secured by a pin 14 , 15 . In an assembly having two superimposed spring leaves one clamping band has a depending portion in which the end of the lower leaf is slidably located. In another form the attachment member is an eye with a tang having an enlarged end which is received into a complementary recess in the end of the spring leaf and retained therein by the clamping band.
