# Leaf spring roller guide.

## Abstract
One piece plastic roller guide 16 having a tubular body and two sets of three leaf springs 40 projecting symmetric ally from the root 24 of the tubular body in opposite axial directions. At the free end of each set of leaf springs 40 , the inner diameter of the roller guide is slightly less than the diameter of the fixed cylindrical pin 18 on which it is mounted. This slight interference between the springs 40 and the pin 18 assures continuous contact between the roller guide 16 and pin 18 without unduly inhibiting rotation.
