## Description
Phenyl piperazine derivatives having antiagressive activity The invention relates to new phenyl piperazine derivatives, to the preparation of these compounds, and to compositions comprising at least one of these compounds as an active substance. Various phenyl piperazine derivatives with or without pharmacological properties are known. From Indian J. Appl. Chem. 1972 , 35, pp. 129130 which article is referred in Chem. Abstr. 81, 120577 n , the preparation is known of five compounds of formula 1 of the formula sheet, in which R is the phenyl group, p chlorophenyl group, p fluorophenyl group, p methoxyphenyl group or 3,5 dimethoxyphenyl group. These compounds have been prepared in the scope of an investigation into new anthelmintics. Furthermore, an article in J. Med. Chem. 9, 1966 , pp. 153 155 relates to compounds of formula 2, in which R1 may be the phenyl group or 4 chlorophenyl group,R2 is, for example, hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert.butyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl, and n is 1 or 2. The compounds have been tested for several activities and in most of the cases proved to have no activity. It has now been found that phenyl piperazine derivatives of formula 3 of the formula sheet, in which R3 is a trifluoromethyl group or a halogen atom, R4 is an alkyl group or an alkoxy group having 1 3 C atoms, a cycloalkoxy group having 5 7 C atoms, trifluoromethyl, vinyl, nitrile, phenyl, halogen , alkyl , alkoxy or trifluoromethyl substituted phenyl, a thienyl.group, pyridyl group or pyrimidyl group, or a group NR5R6, in which H5 and R6 each are a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 or 2 C atoms, or a vinyl group, and A is the group CH2 , CH2CH2 , CH3 CH CH2 or CH 2 C1H CH3 and the salts thereof, have a strong antiagressive activity. Some of the compounds belonging to this group are in addition readily analgetically active.In formula 3, R4 is preferably amino, methyl, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl or a phenyl group substituted by chlorine, fluorine, methyl or methoxy. The antiagressive activity of the compounds was measured in a test suitable for this purpose on isolated mice Advances in Pharmacol. 5, 1967 , 79 . In this test, male albino mice were kept isolated for a period of 4 weeks and were then selected for the test on the basis of the presence of fighting behaviour. The selection criterion is the occurrence of 3 or more fighting periods within 3 minutes after a mouse not kept isolated was placed in the cage of the mouse kept isolated. The compounds to be investigated were administered Morally to the selected mice. Per dosis 5 mice were used. Sixty minutes after the administration of the compound to be investigated the animals were again evaluated for fighting behaviour. The compound to be investigated is inactive in the dosis administered when this time also 3 or more fighting periods were observed within 3 minutes after a mouse not kept isolated was placed in the cage of an isolated mouse. From the results obtained the ED50 value in mg of active substance per kg of body weight was calculated. The compounds according to the invention have an ED50 value which is smaller than 10 mg kg and for most compounds the ED50 value is 1 5 mg kg. Due to the strong antiagressive activity and the absence of undesired side effects, such as sympatholytic, dopaminolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative properties, the compounds are excellently suitable for administration in the treatment of intrapunitive and extrapunitive behaviour and overt agressive behaviour in man and animal. For medical use in men is to be considered first of all the control of agressive symptoms in psychiatric illnesses and serious forms of psychopathologic agression. As a possibility of application in the veterinary field are to be considered above all those forms of agression which occur in transporting agricultural domestic animals and the mixing of groups of these animals. The quantity, frequency and mode of administration may differ for each individual case, also dependent on the nature and the severity of the disturbances. Generally, a dose from 5 500 mg, and preferably from 25 150 mg daily will be suitable for application in men. For veterinary applications the dose is preferably from 0.1 10 mg kg of body weight. The active compounds according to the invention and their salts can be processed according to known standard methods to compositions such as pills, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders, injection liquids and the like while using the conventional auxiliary substances such as solid and liquid carrier materials. As examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acids with which the compounds according to the invention can form salts may be mentioned hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzoic acid and the like. The compounds of formula 3 and their salts can be prepared according to methods suitable for the synthesis of analogous compounds. The invention therefore also relates to the preparation of the new compounds and the salts thereof. Dependent on the meaning of R4, the compounds of formula 3 can be obtained according to at least one of the following methods of preparation. By reaction of a compound of the general formula 4 of the formula sheet with a compound of the formula C1 A CO NH CO R4. This reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile at a temperature between 20 C and the boiling point of the solvent used, in the presence of an acid binder. Compounds of formula 3 according to the invention, in which R4 is an amino group or an alkoxy group, can also be obtained by reacting a compound of formula 5 with ammonia, alkylamine, methanol, or ethanol. This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent such as ether, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, or methylene chloride, at a temperature between 0 0C and the boiling point of the solvent used see United States Patent Specification 3,155,700 and J. Org. Chem. 28, 1963 , p. 1805 . Furthermore, compounds of formula 3, in which R4 is for example, NH2, alkyl, alkoxy or phenyl, can also be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 6 with a compound of the formula NH2 CO R4. This reaction is preferably carried out by heating the starting substances without solvent at 7000C for a few hours. The compounds of formula 3 can furthermore be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula 7 with a compound of the formula NH2 A CO NH CO R4. This conversion is preferably carried out in a solvent such as butanol, in the presence of an acid binding agent such as K2C03, at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent see British Patent Specification 943,739 . Finally, the compounds of formula 3 can be obtained in similar reaction circumstances by reaction of a compound of formula 8 with a compound of formula 9 seeColl. Czech. Chem. Comm. 6, 1934 , 211 . The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the examples below.
