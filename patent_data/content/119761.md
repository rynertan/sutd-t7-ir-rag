# PROCESS FOR PREPARING SILVER HALIDE PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIAL FOR PHOTO MECHANICAL PROCESS

## Abstract
A process for preparing a silver halide photographic light sensitive material for photo mechanical process is disclosed. The process involves coating a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer on a support and then coating a light insensitive upper layer on the emulsion layer. The upper layer is comprised of a hydrophilic colloid and is coated on an upper portion of the emulsion layer. A composite solution is then coated on the light insensitive upper layer. The composite solution is comprised of a solution which includes a non diffusion polymeric hardener in a gelatin solution in an amount sufficient to make the melting time of the layer made by the gelatin solution larger than the melting time of the emulsion layer. The composite solution is coated in an amount such that the gelatin coating amount is in the range of 0.05 g m² to 0.5 g m². The resulting material has an improved aptitude for reduction treatment which is obtained without increasing the amount of silver coated on the support. The coating layers formed are excellent with respect to transparency.
