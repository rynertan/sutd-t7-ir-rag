# Manufacturing heat shrinkable sleeve using solid core.

## Abstract
Long lengths of a heat shrinkable sleeve for use in splicing electrical cables are manufactured by providing an elongated impermeable core, extruding an elongated sleeve around and in contact with the core, and effecting an initial expansion of a portion of the sleeve to a larger diameter in an expansion zone 40 so that the sleeve separates and leaves a space between the sleeve and core. A fluid is introduced into the space under pressure via a fitting 62 at the downstream end of the sleeve. To begin the process, a permeable core 26 is used, and the sleeve is extruded around and in contact with the permeable core. A fluid is introduced under pressure from a fitting 52 upstream or downstream of the expansion zone through the permeable core to the inside of the sleeve in the expansion zone, and the leading end of the impermeable core is welded at 50 to the trailing end of the permeable core at a location upstream of the expansion zone. To form the sleeve, an inner compound and a thin layer of outer compound are applied in a crosshead 38a , and balance of the outer compound is applied around the sleeve in a second crosshead 38b . Liquid nitrogen cools and stabilizes the inchoate sleeve at 110 .
