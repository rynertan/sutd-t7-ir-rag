# Ratchet wrench with offset handle.

## Abstract
A reversible ratchet wrench employing spaced plates which hold the sockets and ratchet mechanism in assembly has an offset handle to provide clearance for the hand of the user. The pawl of the ratchet mechanism is in the head portion of the wrench adjacent the socket and the spring loaded plunger is supported in the handle portion. The pawl and plunger engage at an oblique angle at a juncture zone between the handle portion and the socket head portion, which juncture zone affords clearance for operative move ment of the ratchet and plunger during use.
