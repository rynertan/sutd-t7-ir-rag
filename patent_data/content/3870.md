## Description
This invention relates to aqueous polymer resin emulsions for use in water based paints and coatings and more particularly is concerned with such aqueous polymer resin emulsions which incorporate additives to impart improved wet adhesion properties to the water based paints and coatings based thereon. It is well known that the wet adhesion properties of water based paints and coatings based on aqueous polymer resin emulsions can be improved by incorporating into the polymer resin emulsions additives such as allyl carbamate, N carbamyl maleamic acid, 3 buteneamide, N carboallyloxy urea, N carboallyloxy ethylene urea andN allyloxyacetyl ethylene urea. We have now discovered that allyl urea and or methallyl urea are particularly suitable additives in so far as they are readily commercially available, relatively inexpensive and surprisingly effective. According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous polymer resin emulsion for use in water based paints and coatings characterized in that it incorporates allyl urea and or methallyl urea to enhance the wet adhesion properties of water based paints and coatings based thereon. Preferably, said polymer resin is selecte from the group consisting of vinyl ester polymers acrylate polymers methacrylate ester polymers the polymerization product of vinyl acetate in a mixture with at least one polymerizable monomer from the group consisting of ethylene, vinyl chloride, alkyl esters of acrylic acid, alkyl esters of methacrylic acid, and maleic acid the copolymer of vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate and mixtures thereof. The present invention also provides a water based paint or coating comprising an aqueous polymer resin emulsion according to the invention In order to determine the effectiveness of allyl urea in improving wet adhesion properties various tests were carried out. The results of these tests were then compared with similar tests using known additives in place of the allyl urea. Each test mixture was prepared as follows Firstly a seed emulsion was prepared by mixing in a reaction vessel parts by weight FLEXBOND Trademark 325 91 55 solids Natrosal 25.0 LR hydroxy ethyl cellulose 0.89 Fe Trace Deionized water 539 and A copolymer emulsion prepared from 86 parts vinyl acetate, 14 parts butyl acrylate, stab ilized with hydroxyethyl cellulose. The reactants were agitated at 200 RPM and heated to 0 65 C while purging with nitrogen. Simultaneously, the following were delayed to the seed emulsion over a 2 hour period parts by weight Vinyl acetate 868 n Butyl acrylate 97 Igepal CO 887 15 Igepal CO 630 10.5 Pluronic F 68 15.5 Pluronic L 64 15.5 t Butyl hydroperoxide 1.4 70 Followed by a solution composed of Additive under 0.75 by test weight of monomers Deionized water 200 parts The polymerization temperature was maintained at 650C using an activator solution consisting of parts by weight Discolite PEA 0.4 Sodium benzoate 1.1 Deionized water 16.4 The vinyl acetate free monomer content was kept between 3 and 5 throughout the polymerization with a jacket tempera ure between 53 and 650C. At the end of the delays, and when the vinyl acetate free monomer content was below 0.5 , the emulsion was cooled. The final pH was 5.1 and the solids content was 55.6 , The emulsion was then worked up into a standard semi gloss waterbased paint formulation. Each water based paint was then subjected to 1. The cut film test and 2. The floating board test. Details of the cut film test for testing wet adhesion to a surface of semi gloss paint are set out inUnited States Federal Specification TT P 001511, paragraph 4.3.9 GSA FSS . In this test a panel is painted with an alkyd enamel of specified composition and permitted to dry under specified conditions. The test paint is then applied over the alkyd surface and dried. A cut is then made longitudinally through the center of the test film and the panel scrubbed under water at a specified rate of brush travel. To pass this part of the test, there must be no loss of adhesion between the test paint and the alkyd undercoat and no wearing through to the undercoat in fewer than 5,000 cycles. A second cut is then made perpendicular to the first on the test film and the board is subject to an additional 1000 cycles of under water brushing.To pass this part of the test there must be no loss of adhesion between the test paint and the alkyd undercoat. In the floating board test, the composition to be tested is applied over a dry glossy alkyd painted plane board surface and dried. A one inch section of the surface is scored by cross hatching with parallel cuts vertical and horizontal 1 10 1 8 inch apart. An adhesive tape is applied to the dry scored surface and the relative amounts of the surface film peeled off by the adhesive observed. The board is again similarly scored and then floated face down on a water bath to wet the scored surface and the adhesive tape procedure repeated, again observing the amount of painted surface removed. Details of the tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
