# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLABLY SUPPLYING PRIORITIZED ELECTRICAL EXCITATION SIGNALS

## Abstract
A circuit is disclosed for controllably supplying a plural ity of electrical excitation signals. The circuit includes interruptible electrical excitation signal supplying circuitry for supplying the plurality of electrical excitation signals. At least one of the plurality of electrical excitation signals is selected as having priority over the remainder of the plurality of electrical excitation signals, the at least one selected electrical excitation signal being designated a priority excita tion signal. The interruptible electrical excitation signal supplying circuitry is responsive to a priority interrupt signal for supplying the priority excitation signal upon detection of the priority interrupt signal irrespective of the electrical excitation signal that the interruptible electrical excitation signal supplying circuitry is supplying other than the priority excitation signal, the interruptible electrical excitation signal supplying circuitry not being responsive to interrupt signals for supplying other than the priority excitation signal while the priority excitation signal is supplied.
