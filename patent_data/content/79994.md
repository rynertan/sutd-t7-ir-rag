## Description
TRANSPORTATION OF CARGOESThe present invention relates to the transportation of cargoes. A knozn road transport vehicle is adapted to carry a load such as a container by means of so called twist locks positioned so as to locate and secure each corner of the container. The twist lock operates by passing through a non circular hole in the bottom of a member attached to the bottom of the container and then being rotated about a vertical axis through approximately 90O so that the head of the twist lock is out of alignment with the major axis of the noncircular hole in the container.There are several sizes of containers such as, for example, 4Oft units, 3Qft units and 20ft units. A transporter vehicle, for instance, a 40ft lorry semitrailer, therefore, is generally equipped with several sets of such twist locks positioned so as to correspond to the corner positions of all the possible types of containers to be carried. In such a case there may often be twelve such twist locks distributed on the transporter vehicle so that in use the containers would be held in a suitable position for correct weight distribution.The twist locks and containers are both of a well known internationally standardised design, and as well as containers, other cargo carrying receptacles may be transported in a similar manner. Such carriers may be, for instance, bulk liquid tanks, flat container beds or non standard cargo containers or platformsThe use of such cargo support means in the handling of cargoes greatly simplifies and speeds loading and unloading.However, such cargo support means must usually be transported empty back to the loading location before being used again. Thus, where an empty cargo supporting means, ox one carrying a low density load is transported, a transporter vehicle may be loaded to capacity by the cargo supporting means and or load and yet still be well within its weight carrying limits. Conversely, a high density load such as steel rods occupies a relatively small poroportion of the potential cargo carrying volume of. the transporter, which would advantageously be filled by an optimum load.According to the present invention there is provided a method of securing a detachable cargo support means to a transporter vehicle, said method comprising locating said cargo support means to support members projecting upwardly from the normal load carrying surface of said transporter vehicle, so that additional cargo may be carried in the space between the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle and the cargo support means. Preferably the transporter vehicle is a lorry, truck, trailer or semi trailer.Preferably said cargo support means comprises one or more standard containers, non standard cargo containers, tanks, flat container beds, or other cargo platforms or receptacles.Preferably there is a support member at each corner of a substantially rectangular cargo support means.Preferably the support members are equipped at their uppar ends with substantially conventional twist locks positioned so as to mate with corresponding recesses in the cargo support means.Preferably the support members are of adjustable height above the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle.Preferably said supporting members are removably attached to the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle.Preferably there may be attached to said supporting members substantially horizontally extending rails, such that, in use, said rails restrain the movement of cargo carried beneath the cargo support means, in a direction longitudinally and or transversely of the transporter vehicle.The present invention also provides an assembly for the transport of cargo support means, said assembly comprising a transporter vehicle having a normal load carrying surface, and a plurality of support members which, in use, project upwardly from said normal load carrying surface so as to locate said cargo support means above the level of the normal load carrying surface, so that additional cargo may be carried between said normal load carrying surface and said cargo support means.Preferably said support members are secured vertically to said transporter vehicle by means of substantially conventional twist locks fitted to the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle.Preferably said support members when not in use may be retracted, folded or removed, or otherwise stowed so that the surface of the load carrying platform of the transporter vehicle is substantially horizontally flat.More preferably said support members are stowed such that cargo support means may be secured to the normal load carrying surface of the, transporter vehicle by means of substantially conventional twist locks fitted to said surface.The present invention further provides a support member for locating cargo support means on a transporter vehicle, said support member being adapted so as to be capable of detachable attachment to cargo support means such that, in use, the support member holds said cargo support means above the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehiclePreferably said support member is fitted with substantially conventional twist locks at its upper end for the location and securing of the cargo suppor means.Preferably said support member is adapted for retraction, folding or stowing, when not in use, so as to leave substantially flat the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle.Preferably said support member may be secured in an upright position on the transporter vehicle by means of substantially conventional twist locks fitted to the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle. Preferably said supporting member is capable of being fitted with substantially horizontally extending rails that in use restrain the transverse and or longitudinal movement of cargo carried between the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle and the cargo support means.The support member may be an integral part of the transporter vehicle, or may be free standing on the normal load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle, either individually or joined by suitable connecting members to one or more similar support members. Conveniently, said support member is detachably attached to said transporter vehicle, and arranged so that when not required it can be stowed so as not to interfere with the conventional operating of the vehicle. The present invention allows a transport operator to carry a more efficient mix of general cargo comprising both high and low density cargoes on the same transporter vehicle. This is particularly useful in connection with the transport of empty containers or similar cargo support means, in combination with loads such as, for instance, steel bars, ingots, drums, concrete products and other general cargo. Rising operating costs make the carrying of an optimum load for each transportation unit increasingly desirable, so such mixtures of loads are economically advantageous.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of examplesonly, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a loaded transporter in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of a support member in accordance with the present invention Figure 3 is a perspective view of a member on a transporter, such as that shown in Figure I,to which the support member of Figure 2 is fitted Figure 4 is a side elevation of the support member ofFigure 2 when fitted to the transporter equipped as inFigure 3 andFigure 5 is a rear elevation of an alternative form of support member in accordance with the present invention.Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, a transporter, in this case, a 40ft platform skeletal semi trailer, carries one 40ft empty container 7 over, for example, approximately 15 tons of steel bars, which is secured by chains to the normal load carrying surface 5 of the trailer 1. The container 7 is supported above the normal load carrying surface 5 by means of four support members 3 of which only the left hand support members 3a and 3b are shown . The central support members are in the stowed position.When it is not desired to transport cargo support means such as containers above the normal load carrying surface of the trailer, the support members 3 may be folded into cut outs in the normal load carrying surface 5 so as to lie as shown in Figure 1, with their locating and locking portions lying horizontally, leaving the load carrying surface 5 substantially as in a conventional transporter vehicleAn embodiment of a support member and a trailer in accordance with the present invention are shown inFigures 2 to 4. In this embodiment of the present invention the support members pivot from a horizontal stowed position to a vertical operational position, and are held in the vertical position by the original twist lock mechanism supplied with the trailer.In the stowed position the support members lie flush with the normal load carrying surface 5 of the trailer.Referring to Figure 3, the substantially conventional trailer load bearing surface 5 has cut out portions extending transversely inwardly from near the edges of the load bearing surface 5 with, at the front or rear end of the cut out portion with respect to the transporter vehicle, a substantially conventional twist lock mechanism 43 passing through a support plate 41. From the sides of the twist lock mechanism 43 project parallel substantially T shaped members 40. At the lower end of the vertically extending portion most remote from the twist lock mechanism 43, are circular holes 42, which may conveniently be fitted with bushes.The support members comprise parallel L shaped members 33 whose parallel separation is slightly smaller than the parallel separation of the.corresponding L shaped members 40 on the trailer. The members 33 are similarly provided with, at the lower vertically extending portions of members 33, holes 36, which may also be provided with bushes 38. The holes 36 in the members 33 are joined by a cylinder 35 attached perpendicularly to the planes of the L shaped members 33 and extending between them. Connected between the horizontal arms of the Lshaped members 33 and projecting vertically upwardly from said arms is box sectioned pillar 37. The pillar 37 has a base 39 which is provided with a rectangular hole through which, in use, the twist lock mechanism 43 may project and lock.The top of the pillar 37 is fitted with a plate 45 extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pillar 37. Attached to the central re ion of the plate 45 is a twist lock 49 which has a rectangularly shaped horizontal cross section, corresponding to similarly shaped recesses in the cargo support means to be carried.Passing through a circular hole in the plate 45 and the lock 49 is an operating rod 53, to the lower end of which is fitted a handle 51. Access to the handle 51.is provided by the aperture 47 extending over the outer side of the U sectioned pillar 37.In use, the support member is held in position on the trailer by passing through the holes 36 and 42 a suitable retaining pin 57. In the stowed position the support member is allowed to pivot about the support pin 57 so as to lie with the surface of the pillar 37 lying substantially flush with the upper surface of the normal load bearing surface 5 oe the trailer. A loaded container can then be conventionally secured to the twist lock mechanism 43 if desired.In the operational position, the support member is pivoted upwards about the retaining pin 57 and is then secured in position by the twist lock mechanism 43 projecting through a hole in the base plate 39 of the piller 37. This is then rotated conventionally through approximately 900 so as to secure the support member in the upright position. A container can then be conventionally secured by the twist lock mechanism 49 located on top of the pillar 37 To secure cargo support. means such as a container to the support means, the support means is locked in the upright position, and a container is lowered onto the support means. The top of the twist lock 49 is aligned with an oval hole in the container base and so projects through the hole.The twist lock is then rotated axially through about 900 so as to move the top of the lock out of alignment with the oval hole in the container, and using the handle 51 6f the lock, the top of the twist lock is screwed down into contact with the container base, thus securely locking the container in position on the support means. In an alternative embodiment, the support members may be permanently attached to the transporter by, for example, weldingIn another alternative embodiment shown in Figure 5, pairs of support members 63 may be joined together at their lower ends by a beam 61, for instance of steel, so that in use the support members 63 are free standing on the load carrying surface 5 of the transporter, with the beam 61 lying transversely across the load carrying surface 5. In such an embodiment, the support members 63 are held in position by the locking of the support members 63 to the conventional twist locks fitted to the load carrying surface of the transporter vehicle, and by the weight of the additional cargo carried, which lies on the crossbeams 61, so retaining it in position.This embodiment is especially suitable for use with loads such as steel bars, and may be preferably to other embodiments described in that no modification of the transporter is required. A projection from the bottom of each of the support members 3 perpendicularly to the bean 61, either forwardly or reanfardly serves to prevent rocking of the support members on the braking or accelerating of the transporter vehicle. When not required, free standing support members such as 63 may conveniently be carried beneath the load carrying surface 5 of the transporter vehicle,In a further alternative embodiment the support members may be arranged so as to be capable of sliding vertically through holes in the load carrying surface of the transporter, from a stowed to an operational position. Such a support member may be held in the desired position by, for instance, retaining pinsAll components of the present invention may be made of any suitable material. For example, a support member in scordance with the present invention may be of box section, tubular, channel section or angled steel.
