# APPARATUS THROUGH WHICH A FLUID CAN FLOW UNDER COUNTER PRESSURE

## Abstract
An apparatus through which a fluid can flow under counter pressure, such as a screw type compressor, com prising at least one male and one female rotor, having on the side faces thereof enmeshing profilings, said rotors being rotatable in partially overlapping cylindrical spaces disposed within the compressor housing, while the profilings of the male rotor and of the female rotor have such a shape that when the two rotors are rolling on each other in the common area of the cylinders, the bottom and walls of the channel shaped profiling of the female rotor are in contact with crests forming part of the profiling of the male rotor, with formation of a linear seal.
