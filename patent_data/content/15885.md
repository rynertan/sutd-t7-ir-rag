# Method for closing a container with a cover.

## Abstract
A coating on an external rim 29 of a container 30 to be closed by heat sealing a coated cover 19 onto the rim 29 is heat activated in a preheating stage 15 and then the cover 19 is pressed onto the rim 29 whllst applying heat to the cover 19 and or rim 29 so that the coatings on the rim and cover are sealed together. The preheating 15 preferably is with hot air whilst the rim 29 is supported on a support frame 31 which prefer ably is also heated. The invention has particular applica tion to cardboard containers of food requiring cooking by the consumer and permits the use of Surlyn cover coat ings 47 with polyester rim coatings 48 for such con tainers 30 . In the Surlyn polyester combination, it is preferred that the cover 19 and rim 29 are only pres sed together at a plurality of discrete locations so that polyester is squeezed into intermediate areas allowing Surlyn to penetrate the cardboard layer 46 of the rim 29 at the pressing locations.
