# Heterojunction transistors.

## Abstract
The base region 4 and the collector region 6 of a het erojunction transistor, and an electrode 8 bridging the base and collector regions, are formed of such materials that the electrode 8 forms an ohmic contact with the base region 4 and a Schottky barrier contact with the collector region 6 . The transistor may have a p type GaAlAs base region and an n type GaAs collector region and the electrode 8 may comprise platinum, palladium or nickel. Alternatively, a bridging electrode makes an ohmic con tact to the base region and a Schottky barrier contact to the emitter region.
