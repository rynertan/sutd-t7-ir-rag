# Process fpr producing a magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium comprising a flexible substrate of a polymeric material, a first magnetic layer of a ferromagnetic metal deposited on the substrate by an ionized cluster beam deposition method, and a second magnetic layer of a ferromagnetic material deposited on the first magnetic layer by a high vacuum ion plating deposition method. Such media are produced by causing a kinetic energy of 100 eV to 10 KeV to be imparted to ionized clusters of ferromagnetic metal atoms in a vacuum corresponding to a pressure of 8 10 ⁴ to 1 10 ¹⁰ torr, for example by accelerating the clusters emitted from a cluster source 7 towards an electrode 11 in a vacuum chamber 4 , and causing the resulting ionized cluster beam 9 to impinge against a flexible substrate 5 of a polymeric material to deposit a first magnetic layer of ferromagnetic metal there on, and causing a kinetic energy of 1 eV to 10 KeV to be imparted to atom ions of a ferromagnetic metal by an ion plating method in a vacuum corresponding to a pressure of 8 10 ⁴ to 1 10 ¹⁰ torr, for example by accelerating the ionised atoms emitted by an ion source 8 towards an electrode 12 in the same vacuum chamber 4 as in the previous step, and causing the resulting atom ion beam 10 to impinge against the first magnetic layer to deposit a second magnetic layer of ferromagnetic metal on the first layer. The recording media can be used on tape recorders.
