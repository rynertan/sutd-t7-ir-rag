# Treatment of insoluble surfaces to inhibit nonspecific protein binding.

## Abstract
Compositions for inhibiting nonspecific binding protein to water insoluble surfaces, where specific binding of protein is involved. Specifically, hydrophilic polysaccharides, normally soluble in water, are covalently bonded to the water insoluble surface to substantially completely coat the surtace. A biologi cal substance may then be coupled to the polysaccharide and permit specific binding of protein to the covalently bonded bio logical substance and easy removal of nonspecifically bound protein. The compositions find use in competitive protein bind ing assays, cytology, serology, agglutination assays and the like.

## Description
Description Treatment Of Insoluble Surfaces To Inhibit Nonspecific Protein BindingTechnical Field This invention relates to biological or immunological substances attached to solid carriers for use in diagnostic tests, enzyme processes, affinity purifications, and the like.Background Art Soluble biological substances attached to solid carriers have many uses in diagnostic tests, enzyme processes, and affinity purifications. For example, attachment of antibodies or antigens to a solid carrier allows their immunological partners to be easily removed from a mixture of many substances.Similarly, attaching enzymes to a solid carrier allows them to be easily removed from the reaction mixture or to be used in a continuous flow process.Heterogenous radioimmunoassays and enzyme immunoassays rely on attachment of one or more of the reactants to a solid phase to enable separation from the free reactants. Agglutination assays to determine the presence of an antigen or antibody in a fluid utilize indicator or carrier particles upon which are carried the appropriate immunological material in order to make the immunological complex more easily visible.Separation and identification of cells, cellular constituents, and bacteria are aided by antibodies or antigens coupled to solids. Biological particles will, for example, specifically adhere to solids coated with appropriate antibodies and antigens so that separation from other particles can be affected. Identification of biological particles can be made through the specific adherence of small particles coated with appropriate antibody or antigen. These small particles can incorporate a substance such as a fluorescent dye, radioactive tracer, or electron dense substance which makes their presence more readily detectable. Two of the major difficulties in the use of solid.carriers as described above are reliably attaching the soluble biological substances and preventing nonspecific sticking of undesired substances to the carrier. The consequences of these problems include excessively high background and low sensitivity in assays and loss of material and low purity in affinity purifications and enzyme processes. The solution to the first of these problems has been approached through covalent bonding of proteins and peptides to polymer solids.For example, U.S Patent No. 3,645,852 discloses a process wherein cyanogen halides are used to activate a water insoluble polymer which then couples to a water soluble protein. Water soluble carbodiimides can be used as a condensing agent to bind protein to polymeric carrier particles according to U.S. Patent No. 3,857,931. Biological substances can be covalently bound to plastic materials whose surfaces have been coated with glutaraldehyde. See U.S. Patent No. 4,001,583 .In U.S. Patent No. 4,046,723 a three step method is revealed for coupling proteins to a latex having surface carboxylic amide groups. A process for the manufacture of protein or peptide polystyrene latex compounds is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,118,349 in which the linkage is effected by means of an aromatic diazonium compound. A two step process is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,140,662 which links immunological substances to latex polymers via reactions with a diamine mediated by a carbodiimide followed by reaction with a bifunctional aldehyde.These and other methods known to couple biological substances to polymer materials see for example,Kiefer The Chemical Modification of Proteins,Haptens, and Solid Supports , Immunological Methods,Academic Press, 1979, pp.137150 are undoubtedly more generally reliable than the hydrophobic bonding which was used prior to the covalent bonding methods. However, they do not alleviate the problem of nonspecific sticking and sometimes make it worse. United Kingdom patent application No.33894 77 discloses an invention which solves some of the above problems by covalently bonding a water soluble polyhydroxy compound, preferably an amino polysaccharide, to a latex carrier, preferably a carboxylated polymer, via a water soluble carbodiimide, the Woodward reagentK N ethyl 5 phenyl isoxazolium 3 sulfonate or a water soluble chloroformiate. The amino groups of the amino polysaccharide which are not bonded to the latex carrier are converted to hydroxyl groups.Then the polysaccharide is activated with periodate to oxidize some of the glucose rings to dialdehydes.Thereafter, an immunological active material is reacted with the thus activated polysaccharide. The reaction with the immunologically active material must be performed shortly after formation of the dialdehydes because the dialdehyde containing polysaccharide is subject to relatively fast degradation. Thus, preactivated latexpolysaccharide particles cannot be readily stored or shipped to an ultimate user who would then be able to attach any desired immunologically active material.Disclosure Of Invention Water insoluble surfaces, particularly particles or vessel surfaces, are coated with polysaccharide coatings, by covalent bonding, generally via a cyanuric halide moiety, to form a polysaccharide coated surface. The polysaccharides are normally high molecular weight and water soluble. The polysaccharide coating may then be used for covalently bonding via a cyanuric halide moiety to a biological substance which is in turn to be used for binding to a protein in a heterogenous protein composition. Easy separation may then be obtained between specifically and nonspecifically bound protein. Also, materials having polysaccharide coated surfaces may be reacted with a cyanuric halide to form an activated reactant which is storable and shippable, whereby the biological substance may be attached by the ultimate user.Best Mode For Carrying Out The Invention Novel solid materials are provided, as particles, surface walls, or the like which can be used in the separation of protenaceous mixtures. Particles will generally be 0.2tLto lcm in diameter.Specifically, a water insoluble surface is coated with a water soluble polysaccharide by covalently bonding the water soluble polysaccharide to the surface using, most preferably, a cyanuric halide moiety or linking group. A biological substance may then be bonded to the polysaccharide by, most preferably, a cyanuric halide moiety or linking group. In any event, at least one of such bondings must be via a cyanuric halide moiety. The resulting product may then be used for isolation of a specific protein or group of proteins from a heterogenous mixture of proteins. Normally, the compositions will be used where specific binding properties between a ligand and..a receptor are involved and one of the members of the specific binding pair is to be segregated from other proteins. When the term cyanuric halide is used herein it includes cyanuric chlorides, bromides, and iodides. The term cyanuric halide moiety means the group remaining after one or mo re of the halides have been replaced by a link to another compound, e.g., to the water insoluble surface, to the polysaccharide, or to a biological substance. A large number of particles have been used for a variety of purposes and linked to a variety of groups. Of particular interest are latex particles as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,046,723, 4,118,349 and 4,140,662. Glass surfaces are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,169,138. Other polymers may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,619,371, 3,700,609 and 4,201,763. In each of these cases, a wide variety of linking groups are disclosed for bonding to various biological substances, particularly proteins. In the embodiment of the invention wherein the polysaccharide coated surface is activated with a cyanuric halide moiety, the manner in which the water insoluble surface is conjugated to the polysaccharide will depend upon the nature of the functional groups of the polysaccharide. Where only hydroxylic groups are available, for the most part ethers or esters will be formed, employing active halogen or nonoxocarbonyl groups. Alternatively, and highly preferred, is employing polysaccharides which have a plurality of amino functionalities.The amino functionalities may be naturally present as part of a glucosamine, for example, or be introduced by modffication of the polysaccharide with a group having a free amino group.Modification of polysaccharides with free amino groups is well known in the literature and an ample number of such polysaccharides are commercially available. The activating cyanuric halide moiety may be linked to the polysaccharide coated surface via the amino groups, hydroxyl groups or other active hydrogen containing groups. The polysaccharides which are employed are characterized by being water soluble, relatively high molecular weight, normally in excess of 5,000 daltons, more usually in excess of 10,000 daltons, and may be 1,000,000 daltons or higher. The polysaccharide may be a polymer or copolymer of glycose s , e.g., glucose and fructose, a mixture of carbohydrates, such as neuraminic acids, uronic acids, glycosamines, or the like. In addition, the polysaccharide may be a combination of block or alternating copolymers or combinations thereof of saccharides and condensation monomers, particularly epoxides. Polysaccharides of particular interest include dextran, Ficoll, a synthetic copolymer of sucrose and epichlorohydron,Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey , agarose, hyaluronic acid, etc. Of particular interest is the presence of an amino group, normally being bonded to a short alkylene chain of from about 2 to 6 carbon atoms, which are bonded to functionalities of the polysaccharide. Particularly convenient is the reaction of diamines with carboxyl functionalities present on the polysaccharide. See Inman, J. ofImmunology 114, 704 709 1975 . In the embodiment of the invention wherein a cyanuric halide moiety is used to activate the polysaccharide coated surface, the polysaccharides may be coupled to carboxyl functionalized polymers by using water soluble carbodiimides, or other compounds as linking agents. Very preferably, however, a cyanuric halide is used as the linking agent. The biological substances are then coupled via their carboxyl groups to the polysaccharide layer through remaining amine groups by use of a cyanuric halide moiety, most preferably cyanuric chloride. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention a cyanuric halide moiety is used to couple the amine functionalized polysaccharide to amine functionalized polymers and also to amine containing biological substances. A wide variety of proteins and polypeptides find use in linking to the polysaccharides. Illustrative of proteins are enzymes, antibodies, natural receptors e.g., thyroxine binding globulin and avidin, globins e.g., hemoglobin, ocular lens proteins, surface antigens, histo compatibility antigens, and the like. The subject compositions can be used wherever an insoluble material is used for specific binding to a protein present in a mixture. This situation is encountered in competitive protein binding assays, cell sorting, cytology, histology, and the like. Since the procedures will vary widely, the subject invention generally involves combining the insoluble material, as a particle or surface of a larger structure, with the protein mixture and allowing a sufficient time for binding between the biological substance on the surface and the specific protein binding partner. The solid surface is then washed free of nonspecifically bound protein, leaving only specifically bound protein. Of particular interest are situations employing particles, which may be labeled or unlabeled. The labels may include radioactive isotopes, fluorescers, magnetic materials, enzymes, enzyme substrates, or the like. The labels may be bonded to the water insoluble surface, the polysaccharide, or the biological substance, desirably being bonded to the water insoluble surface or the polysaccharide. The following examples are by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.

After washing the unbound labelled protein from the microspheres with saline containing 0.1 BSA by centrifugation three times, the bound label was counted. The result was 0.013 anti 4a by weight which corresponds to about 200 IgG molecules per microsphere.Industrial Applicability In accordance with one embodiment of the subject invention, novel compositions are provided comprising water insoluble surfaces coated with covalently bonded via cyanuric halide moieties water soluble polysaccharides, normally amino functionalized, which areslinked to the water insoluble surface. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention polysaccharide coated water insoluble surfaces are bonded to a cyanuric halide moiety to form an activated cdmposition which is storable and which can be readily attached to a biological substance via the cyanuric halide moiety. The two embodiments are preferably used in combination. By covalently bonding biological substances, particularly poly amino acids , separations can be achieved in proteinaceous mixtures by specifically binding the binding partner of the biologial substance to the biological substance bound to the insoluble support. Non specifically bound proteins may be readily separated to provide a clean accurate separation between the specifically bound protein and nonspecific protein. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
