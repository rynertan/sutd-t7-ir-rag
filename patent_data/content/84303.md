# Hydraulic device for the drainage of waste water.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a waste water outlet sanitary plant comprising a siphon forming a water seal 6 to which is connected a waste pipe 3 for connection with sewers and in which an automatic air valve device 11 and a siphon are combined in one single apparatus so that their functions are complementary. A cylindrical body 1 having a permanent water seal 6 and in which a pipe or equivalent connected to an apparatus such as a sink, a basin or waste outlet is dipping, is combined with an automatic air valve 11 with peripheral air entry. Outside the pipe dipping into the water seal there is an internal partition 24 which creates a separation between the water seal 6 and the automatic valve device 11 situated at the upper part of the cylindrical body 1 protecting the said valve 11 against a raising or splashing of the liquid situated in the water seal 6 .
