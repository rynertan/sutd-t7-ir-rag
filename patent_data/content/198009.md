## Description
This invention relates generally to the current sources. More particularly, this invention relates to current sources having controllable temperature characteristics for use in integrated circuits. As progress is made toward minaturisation of FM transmitters and receivers, the FM demodulator remains one of the most difficult circuits to miniaturise. This is primarily due to the moderately high frequencies that are normally involved and the inability to reduce the size of inductors of suitably high inductance and Q factor for use in such demodulators. As the size of such devices diminishes it is also important that FM demodulators be capable of operation at very low voltage and current levels since battery size is a basic limitation in miniaturisation of such devices. The quadrature demodulator is frequently used in FM communications applications due to such desirable characteristics as high audio output and high signal to noise ratio. It is therefore very desirable to provide an inductorless version of a quadrature demodulator which may be fully integrated on a single integrated. circuit. Unfortunately, integrating a quadrature demodulator presents a number of technical challenges which must be overcome. This is especially true when the demodulator must be operated reliably over a wide range of temperatures and when steps must be taken to insure trimmability of the demodulator to assure optimum performance under all environmental conditions and integrated circuit processing variations. Under these conditions, highly temperature stable circuitry is required and the ability to precisely control temperature coefficients independent of the individual component temperature coefficients is very important. It is also important to have the ability to adjust circuit performance to account for variations in integrated circuit processing parameters, that is, to initially tune or adjust the circuit to overcome manufacturing variations in component values. A current source in accordance with the prior art part of claim 1 is disclosed in Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 6, no. 221 p 153 1099 , 5.11.82 JA A 57 125 417 of 04.08.82. In this document two current sources, each including a temperature dependent resistor have their currents subtracted and mirrored to an output by a current mirror. This invention seeks to provide a temperature stable current source for use in integrated circuits such as the present demodulator. In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a controlled temperature coefficient current source circuit comprising a first resistor having a first predetermined temperature coefficient and a current source oupled to the first resistor for supplying a first current having a first temperature coefficient which is dependent upon the first predetermined temperature coefficient CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the circuit includes An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying single Figure drawing which shows a detailed schematic of an embodiment of the current source circuit in accordance with the present invention. The current source circuit includes a current source portion 40 and temperature compensation network 42. An unregulated supply is provided at node 74 which is coupled to the emitter of transistors 300 and 302. The bases of transistors 300 and 302 are also coupled together and coupled to the collectors to transistors 304 and 306. The base of transistor 304 is coupled to the base and collector of transistor 308. The emitters of transistors 304 and 308 are grounded. The base of transistor 308 is connected to node 310 through resistor 314. The base of transistor 316 is coupled to node 310 through resistor 318. The emitter of transistor 316 is connected to the emitter of transistor 306 through resistor 320. The base of transistor 306 is coupled to one side of capacitor 324, a first collector of transistor 302 and the collector of transistor of 326. The other side of capacitor 324 is grounded as is the emitter of transistor 326. The base of transistor 326 is connected to the base and emitter of transistor 330 as well as the second collector of transistor 302. The emitter of transistor 330 is connected to ground through a diffused current setting reference resistor 334. Transistors 300 and 302 are PNP transistors and transistors 304, 308, 316, 326 and 330 are NPN transistors. In addition, transistor 330 is a X4 transistor and transistor 308 is a X8 transistor. The collector of transistor of 300 is coupled to node 41 and forms one output of the current source. The current source is a band gap based reference circuit that operates as follows Transistors 326, 330, 306 and 302 form a feedback loop in which the ratio of the junction areas of 326 and 330, together with the value of 334, establish a reference current flow through 326 and 330 that is given by The bias voltage established by the reference circuit on the base of transistor 302 further biases other similar transistors connected to this node to mirror the reference current. Thus, the reference current is mirrored by transistor 300, to a terminal 41 to provide a controlled current mirror type current source. When node 310 is connected to a logic high voltage, transistor 316 is turned ON by the current flowing through resistor 318, and the collector of 316 saturates, thereby grounding the end of 320 and turning on the current source. When the node 310 is connected to a logic low, transistor 316 is turned off as is transistor 304 causing base bias to be removed from transistors 300 and 302 thereby shutting off the current source. In temperature compensation network 42, the emitter of transistor 350 is connected to the supply at node 74 as is the emitter of transistor 352. The base of transistor 350 is coupled to a first collector of transistor 350 as well as the base of transistor 302 of current source 40. The second collector of transistor 350 is connected to the base and collector of transistor 354 and the base of transistor 356. The emitter of transistor 354 is grounded through an ion implanted current setting reference resistor 360. Transistor 354 forms the compensation diode for a current mirror circuit formed by transistors 354, 350, 352, 356 and resistor 360. The emitter of transistor 356 is grounded. The collector of transistor 356 is connected to the base of and a first collector of transistor 352. The second collector of transistor 352 is connected to node 46 and provides the output of temperature compensation network 42. Transistors 350 and 352 are PNP transistors and transistors 354 and 356 are matched NPN transistors, with transistor 354 being 10X larger in emitter area than transistor 356. Temperature Compensation network 42 is designed to generate an output current with a positive temperature coefficient on the order of 9000 parts per million per degree Celcius ppm to compensate for the approximately equal but negative temperature coefficient of an active filter coupled thereto resulting mainly from variations in resistors, capacitors, transistor emitter resistance and device current gain variations over temperature. Since the base current of transistor 350 is also supplied through transistor 306, the compensation network is also controlled by node 310. The operation of the temperature compensation network is as follows. A bias current that mirrors the reference current established by current source 40 flows from one collector of transistor 350 through diode connected transistor 354 and implanted resistor 360. This current is in turn mirrored by a current multiplying current mirror formed by the combination of transistors 354 and 356 and resistor 360 to establish an output current in the collector of 356 that is further mirrored by PNP transistor 352 to the output node 46. A key aspect of the design of the temperature compensation bias circuit is that it intentionally uses different resistor structures with different temperature characteristics in current mirror circuits to generate an output current with a temperature coefficient that can be varied over a wide range simply by appropriate selection of the resistor values and mirror parameters. Thus, diffused resistor 334 of current source 40 is fabricated with the same diffusion that forms the bases of the NPN transistors and has a temperature coefficient of approximately 1500 to 1800 parts per million per degree Celcius ppm . The collector current of transistor 350, thus, has a temperature coefficient T.C. of approximately 1700 ppm, which is the result of its T.C. being a function of TO 300 degrees Kelvin and the T.C. of resistor 334. In order to exactly compensate for the temperature variations of a network such as an active filter, the physical structure and voltage drop across resistor 360 may be selected to generate the required temperature characteristics. As will be demonstrated mathematically, the T.C. of the output current of the compensation network can be adjusted over a wide range by appropriate selection of the structures used to form resistors 334 and 360 and other mirror parameters. For the specific embodiment shown here, an ion implanted resistor structure with a sheet resistance of 2K ohms square and a T.C. of approximately 4200 ppm is used to implement resistor 360. The current at the terminal 46 has a T.C. which follows the equation Simplification of the above equations reveals that the resultant temperature coefficient of the current leaving node 46 is a function of the temperature coefficient of the current leaving the collector of transistor 350 I1 plus a predetermined algebraic multiplier or boost factor I1R Vt times the current I1 plus the multiple times the difference between the T.C. of resistor 360 and the T.C. of the thermal voltage. In this embodiment, a temperature coefficient of approximately 9000 ppm for the output current is achieved in order to appropriately compensate the active filter. However, the present temperature compensation network should not be limited to this preferred embodiment since a wide range of temperature coefficients may be implemented using the principal disclosed. By substitution into the above equations, it can be seen that using resistors 334 and 360 of the same temperature coefficient results only in circuit redundance with the same T.C. of current in the collectors of transistor 350 and 352. This is the case if both resistors are either diffused T.C. of resistance approximately 1700 ppm , implanted T.C. of resistance approximately 4200 ppm or an external carbon resistor T.C. of resistance approximately 100 ppm . Various ranges of temperature coefficients of current can be obtained at the collector of transistor 352 by appropriately selecting various combinations of the above resistor types or other temperature dependant resistive elements such as thermisters . For example, if resistor 334 is external and resistor 360 is diffused, a positive T.C. can be achieved to any desired degree above approximately 3200 ppm without otherwise modifying the circuit. In this example the above equation reduces to A similar analysis with resistor 360 external and resistor 334 diffused results in the following Another interesting example occurs if resistor 334 is implanted and 360 is diffused. In this case, the equation reduces to Clearly many other permutations of the above analysis may be carried out with various results. If should be noted, however, that in each case a multiplication of the temperature coefficient takes place by a controllable factor of RI1 V
