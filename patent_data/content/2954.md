# Gas discharge display apparatus of the self shift type.

## Abstract
Gas discharge display apparatus of the self shift type for displaying characters. The panel has a plurality of vertical parallel shift channels along which discharge spots can be shifted. Characters made up of discharge spots are displayed in horizontal lines. Apparatus which reduces operator fatique employs a self shift PDP 20 with write and shift circuitry 14 to 22 such that discharge spots for making up characters are initiated at adjacent ends of shift channels which run vertically . The discharge spots are shifted vertically so as to form the characters horizontally in a line in a monitor area 11 of the self shift PDP 10 next to those ends of the shift channels. The characters are formed in their final horizontal positions in the monitor area 11 , with a saving of time, and characters can be readily altered. The characters are then shifted jointly, from monitor area 11 , into a display area 12 . In a further embodiment the apparatus also comprises a cursor display area 31 and a second write row area 34 .
