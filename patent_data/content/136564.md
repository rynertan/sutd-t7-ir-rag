# END SEAL FOR CERAMIC ARC DISCHARGE TUBES

## Abstract
Sealing means for arc discharge tubes employ chamfers formed in the arc tube which mate with frusto conical portions on sealing disks. Self centering is thus provided as well as the elimination of one wire stop positioner for holding the sealing disks.
