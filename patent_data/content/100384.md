## Description
An Automatic Door shutting DeviceBackground of the Invention So far, there is no automatic door hinge able to have a door being opened at a large angle without being moved by the normal flowing air, and no door hinge being furnished with a buffer means therefore, the door using conventional hinge is liable to be damaged. In the general conventional hinges, once they are installed on the jamb and door, it would be rather difficult to disassemble. Further, the existing general secondary hinges have no satisfactory structure in correcting the deviated axis between the primary and the secondary hinges as a result, after a long period of use, the door will not be opened or shut smoothly. This invention is particularly designed to improve or eliminate the aforesaid drawbacks of the conventional hinges.Summary of the Invention This invention provides a new Automatic Doorshutting Device, which comprises a set of primary hinge and a set of secondary hinge. Said primary hinge not only can rotate towards both directions, but also has a buffer and retarding effects during shutting the door, and also can have the door opening at a large angle for longer time without being moved by a normal flowing air.Said secondary hinge is furnished with two eccentric axle bush, which may be used for correcting and maintaining the door on the real axial line in case of said automatic door shutting device having a deviation from the right centre, i.e., the primary hinge and the secondary hinge being aligned on the same axis so as to have the door rotating smoothly. Further, the left and right side primary hinge pieces, and the left and right side secondary hinge pieces all are detachable easily. In other words, this invention is easy to be installed and removed from a door so as to facilitate the maintenance of the door.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows an exploded view of the primary hinge in this invention.

The structure and functions of the primary hinge Figure 1 shows an exploded view of the primary hinge in this invention, which includes a left side primary hinge piece 1 fixed on the upper portion of the jamb 3 and a right side primary hinge piece 2 fixed on the upper portion of the door 4 as shown in Figure 9 . Said left side primary hinge 1 may be attached to the jamb 3 by means of a positioning piece 11, which has a base sleeve 12 with a stair case shaped hole 121 so as to facilitate the stair case shaped axle seat 13 and the lower portion of the axle rod 14 to be fitted in and fixed thereto.At the top portion of the axle rod 14 , an axle bush 141 is mounted between said axle bush 141 and said axle rod 14 , a steel ball collar 142 is furnished so as to enable said axle bush 141 smoothly moving around said axle rod 14 . The top of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 is partially in slantingly flat shape with a stair case shaped groove 131 , for which Figure 1 3 may be referred to for better understanding. In said stair case shaped groove 131 , the 0 point is the lowest point, from where the slope surface is gradually and slantingly going up in both the clockwise and the counter clockwise directions at an angle about 35 then, the ascending slope is reduced.At approximate 450, the slope begins to raise again until to an angle of 800. After the angle of 800, the surface become horizontal. At 0 and 900 position, a ball socket 132 is furnished in the portion of small angle slope 35 450 , a small hole 133 is furnished to install a retarding pin 134 and a spring 135 therein. The top end of said retarding pin 134 has a very small part being projected in the stair case shaped groove 131 . Figure 1 4 shows a V shaped groove 136 being furnished in said small slope portion 35 450 to replace said retarding pin 134 . Figure 1 1 and 1 2 show another embodiment of the stair case shaped axle seat 13 , of which the slope surface begins to gradually go up from the lowest point 0 at both sides after a slope angle about 350, the slope has smaller angle at the positions around 350 450, 800 900, and 1250 1350, three small holes 133 are furnished so as to install a retarding pin 134 and a spring 135 therein respectively at 0 and 1800 positions a ball socket 132 is furnished therein respectively. Before assembling the lower portion of said staircase shaped axle seat 13 and the axle rod 14 into the stair case shaped hole 121 of the base sleeve 12 , first put the lower portion of said axle rod 14 into the centre hole 137 of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 then, put the lower portion of said stair caseshaped axle seat 13 into the stair case shaped hole 121 . Since the inner surface of said hole 121 and the lower portion of said axle seat 13 both have a flat surface, said stair case shaped axle seat 13 would not rotate within said hole 121 . At the thread portion 138 of the lower portion of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 , a spring washer 15 , a nut 16 are attached respectively so as to fix said stair case shaped axle seat 13 in said base sleeve 12 .Upon the axle rod 14 being put into the centre hole 137 of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 , the axle bush 141 will rest on the top surface of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 then, the lower end of said axle rod 14 will extend out of the bottom of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 , being fitted with a lock ring 17 in the groove 143 so as to prevent said axle rod 14 from loosing then, the bottom of the stair case shaped hole 121 is covered with a lid 18 for better looking and dust proof purposes. Figure 3 shows the outer view of an assembled left side primary hinge piece 1 , Figure 1 shows a right side primary hinge piece 2 to be attached to a positioning piece 21 that is put on a door. At one side of said positioning piece 21 , a base sleeve 22 is furnished. The top portion of the axle 23 is to be fitted and locked into the stair case shaped hole 221 of said base sleeve 22 . On the tip of a lug 231 extending from the bottom of said axle 23 , a steel ball 232 or a roller 231 is furnished as shown in Figure 1 5. Around the main body of said axle 23 , a small hole 233, 233 filled with a steel ball 234, 234 is furnished at an angle of every 1200 then, a steel ball collar 235, 235 is fitted outside the steel balls finally, the axle 23 is fitted into the stair case shaped hole 221 of said base sleeve. 22 . After said axle 23 being put into said stair case shaped hole 221 , it will be unable to rotate because of the top portion of said axle and inside said stair case shaped hole 221 both having a flat surface then, put the spring washer 24 , the nut 25 over the top thread portion 236 of said axle 23 in due order so as to fix the axle 23 on said base sleeve 22 .Finally, a lid 26 is put over the stair caseshaped hole 221 for dustproof and better looking purposes. Figure 3 shows the outer view of an assembled right side primary hinge piece 2 . As shown in Figure 1, Figure 4 and 4 1, after said left side and right side primary hinge piece 1 2 being assembled together, only the upper portion of said axle rod 14 is inserted into the axle hole 237 of said axle 23 . Since the steel balls 234,234 of said axle 23 are set around the outer surface of the axle bush 141 of said axle rod 14 , the left side primary hinge piece 1 and the right side primary hinge piece 2 not only can make smooth rotation each other, but also can easily be lifted up for disassembling or assembling operation.The function of mutual rotation between the left and right side primary hinge pieces 1 2 is done by means of the steel ball 232 on the tip of lug 231 of said axle 23 being fitted and rolling smoothly in the stair case shaped groove 131 on the top of sad stair case shaped axle seat 13 . Upon said left side primary hinge piece 1 being fixed, the right side primary hinge piece 2 can rotate upwards to either direction clockwise or counter clockwise because of said steel ball 232 rolling up and down in said stair caseshaped groove 131 . For example, upon the left side primary hinge piece 1 being attached to the jamb 3 and the right side primary hinge piece 2 being attached to the door 4 , said door 4 may be opened to either direction.When said door is in closed position, said steel ball 232 on the tip of said lug 231 of the axle 23 rests in the ball socket 132 at o position of said stair case shaped groove 131 . when the door is opening, said steel ball 232 will roll upwards along said groove 131 to cause said door 4 move upwards.After the door being opened, said steel ball 232 is sitting on the slope portion of said groove 131 , and the door may automatically be closed upon being released as a result of gravity effect. Since said steel ball 232 is liable to rest in the ball socket 132 at 0 position because of gravity effect, said door is closed and stopped in a position desired. Figure 2 shows an assembled primary hinge in door closed position. In case of necessity to have the door 4 being opened at a wide angle for a longer time, open the door 4 to an angle over 800 it may be varied, if necessary so as to have said steel ball 232 reaching to a horizontal portion on the groove 131 and to let the door stay in that position without returning to the zero 00 position. In order to prevent the door from being closed by the normal flowing air, a ball socket 132 is furnished in the horizontal portion of said stair case shaped groove 131 so as to hold said steel ball therein for better positioning force of the door. As shown in Figure 1, the stair case shaped axle seat 13 is furnished 0 with a ball socket 132 at the position of 90 so as to have the door 4 being opened and positioned there till being closed manually. Figure 1 1, and 1 2 show another embodiment of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 , which is used for a door 4 to open at a large angle and to automatically return to zero position. Another features of said primary hinge are the structure of said stair case shaped groove 131 on theStair case shaped axle seat 13 , and the retarding pin 134 , which is used for reducing the closing door speed to prevent from damaging the door 4 , and the primary and the secondary hinges. As shown in Figure 1 andFigure 4, when the steel ball 232 rolls along said groove 131 and reaches the slope portion having less slant angle 350 450 , a buffer effect will be generated to cause the door 4 moving slowly further, a small hole 133 is furnished at a suitable point in the slope portion having less slant angle 350 450 so as to have the top end of said retarding pin 134 being slightly extended out therefrom during the door being closed and upon said steel ball 232 rolling over said small hole 133 , said retarding pin 134 will be pressed downwards to generate a buffer effect to the closing door. Figure 1 4 shows a V shaped groove to replace said retarding pin 134 in the slope portion having less slant angle 350 450 of said groove 131 . Said design is mainly used for a small and light door, which may be unable to close automatically because of having insufficient gravity to cause said steel ball 232 of the lug being fallen into the small hole 133 . B. The structure and function of the secondary hinge The general automatically closing door hinge may be deviated from its correct axis because of the assembling technique, the alignment technique, long time use, the weight of door itself, and the impact during opening and closing, etc. any of said factors may cause the door to have difficulty returning its zero position smoothly therefore, the object of this secondary hinge structure is to eliminate the aforesaid drawbacks by using a dual eccentric axle bush means, through which the axis of the primary and the secondary hinges can always be aligned on a co axial line, and therefore the opening and closing rotation of the door is smooth. Figure 5 shows an exploded view of the secondary hinge, of which the shape looks similar to that of the primary hinge, and which comprises a left side secondary hinge piece 5 to be fixed at the lower portion of the jamb 3 and a right side secondary hinge piece 6 to be fixed at the lower portion of the door 4 as shown inFigure 9. As shown in Figure 5, said left side secondary hinge piece 5 is furnished with a base sleeve 52 that has a stair case shaped hole 521 for installing and positioning the lower portion of the axle rod 53 therein.The upper portion of said axle rod 53 is furnished with a steel ball collar 531 , which is to facilitate an inner eccentric axle bush 54 rotating smoothly around the upper portion of said axle rod 53 once said axle rod 53 being fitted into said bush 54 then, insert said inner eccentric axle bush 54 with the axle rod 53 into the outer eccentric axle bush 55 as soon as the lower end of said axle rod 53 reaches the stair case shaped hole 521 , put a locking ring 56 into the groove 532 so as to prevent said axle rod 53 from loosing. Between said base sleeve 52 and the inner and outer eccentric axle bushes 54, 55 , a number of steel ball 522 are furnished on top of said base sleeve 52 so as to minimize the frictions among them. The lid 57 is to be fitted over the bottom of said stair case shaped hole 521 for dust proof and better looking purposes.Figure 7 shows an outer view of a left side secondary hinge piece 5 being completely assembled. Figure 5 shows a right side secondary hinge piece being attached with a base sleeve 62 , and said hinge piece 6 is to be installed on the door 4 . The stair case shaped hole 621 in said base sleeve 62 is used for mounting and fixing an axle bush 63 .Around the body of said axle bush 63 , three small holes 631 being fitted with a steel ball 632 are furnished at an angle of 1200 one after another, and a steel ball collar 633 is mounted over said steel balls 632 before the whole assembly being inserted into the stair caseshaped hole 621 of the base sleeve 62 . Since both the axle bush 63 body and the stair case shaped hole 621 have flat surface, said axle bush 63 once being inserted into said stair case shaped hole 521 will not rotate therein then, put the spring washer 64 and the nut 65 to the bottom of said hole 621 so as to have said axle bush 63 being fixed within said hole 621 , on which a lid 66 is mounted for dustproof and better looking purposes. Figure 7 shows an outer view of said right side secondary hinge piece 6 assembled. As shown in Figure 5, 8, and 8 1, after said left and right side secondary hinge pieces 5,6 being assembled together, put only the outer eccentric axle bush 55 into the axle hole 634 of the axle bush 63 . Since the steel balls 632 of the axle bush 63 surround the outer edge of said outer eccentric 55 , the left and right secondary hinge piece 5, 6 not only can rotate smoothly each other, but also can be assembled or disassembled easily. Figure 6 shows an assembled secondary hinge in closed state. Figure 8 shows part of the sectional view of said secondary hinge in opening state. As shown in Figure 9, after said hinge assembly being installed to the jamb 3 and the door 4 , the right side primary hinge piece 2 of said primary hinge will have an upward displacement upon opening the door 4 by the same token, the right side secondary hinge piece 6 attached to the lower portion of the door 4 will also move upwards to cause the space between the base sleeve 52 of said left side secondary hinge piece 5 and the base sleeve 62 of said right side secondary hinge piece 6 to be increased. In the general conventional automatic hinges, the rotation of them on the door may not be so smooth as it should be after long time use or because of installation technique however, the real point of said problem is that the axes of said primary hinge and the secondary hinge are not in alignment. As shown in Figure 5, the structure of said secondary hinge is so constructed that its axle rod 53 is put inside the inner eccentric axle bush 54 first, and then inside the outer eccentric axle bush 55 prior to inserting into the axle hole 634 of said axle bush 63 therefore, the axis of said secondary hinge may be varied in a way to align with the axis of said primary hinge on the same axis always. Figure 5 1, 5 2, and 5 3 show the theory of selfcorrective axis of said secondary hinge. As shown inFigure 5 1, a stands for the distance the eccentric distance between the centre of the outer circle and that of the inner circle within said inner eccentric axle bush 54 likewise, a also stands for the distance the eccentric distance between the centre of the outer circle and that of the inner circle within said outer eccentric axle bush 55 The maximum distance between the centre of the outer circle within said outer eccentric axle bush 55 and the centre of the inner circle within said inner eccentric axle bush 54 is 2a , as shown inFigure 5 1.Figure 5 2 shows tht minimum distance zero distance between the centre of the outer circle within said outer eccentric axle bush 55 and the centre of the inner circle within said inner eccentric axle bush 54 , i.e. the said two centres being lapped on a same point.Since the axle bush 63 rotates around the outer eccentric axle bush 55 , the axis of said rotating secondary hinge should be the centre of the outer circle of said outer eccentric axle bush 55 . As shown in Figure 5 1, upon the inner and outer eccentric axle bushes 54, 55 rotating eccentrically, the distance between the new axis the centre of outer circle of the outer eccentric axle bush 55 and the original axis the centre of inner circle of the inner eccentric axle bush 54 of the axle rod 53 is 2a . As shown in Figure 5 2, the new axis and the original axis of said axle rod 53 are in the same axis then, if said new axis is located within a circle of 2a radius from the original axis, the axis of said secondary hinge may be varied within said circle having a radius of 2a so as to be aligned on a co axis with said primary hinge. Figure 5 2 shows the eccentricity between the primary and the secondary hinges, but the axis of said secondary hinge is still maintained in the co axis. Figure 5 1 shows the eccentric state of said primary hinge in that case, it is necessary to have the axis of secondary hinge adjusted to the position within 2a distance from the original axis so as to maintain the primary hinge and the secondary hinge on a co axis, i.e. said inner eccentric axle bush 54 and said outer eccentric axle bush 55 being adjusted to a new axis. Since the new axis scope is still within the circle of 2a radius, the distance between the axis of the outer circle of said inner eccentric axle bush 54 and the original axis is a . When said inner eccentric axle bush 54 rotating around said axle rod 53 , the lows of the centre of the outer circle of said inner eccentric axle bush 54 is still a circle, the solid line circle, as shown in Figure 5 3.Likewise, during the centre of the outer circle of said outer eccentric axle bush 55 rotating around the centre of the outer circle of said inner eccentric axle bush 54 , and during the locus of the centre of outer circle of said inner eccentric axle bush 54 being a circle, a circle of a radius with its centre along the locus of the aforesaid circle is formed, i.e. the indefinite number of dotted line circles with a radius. In fact, said indefinite number of circles of a radius are formed by the centre locus of the centre of outer circle of said outer eccentric axle bush 55 . Since the eccentric distance of both said outer eccentric axle bush 55 and said inner eccentric axle bush 54 is a , the adjustable scope of the new axis of said outer eccentric axle bush 55 is right within a circle of 2a radius from the original axis, including said original axis. Upon said primary and secondary hinges being installed to the jamb 3 and door 4 respectively, no matter how the axis of said primary hinge becomes what eccentric condition because of long time use or the operation of opening and closing the door 4 , a new axis will always be formed by the adaptable adjustment between said inner eccentric axle bush 54 and said outer eccentric axle bush 55 so as to maintain a co axis with said primary hinge, i.e. to keep a smooth operation in opening and closing the door. C. The features of this invention 1 . The stair case shaped groove 131 of said stair case shaped axle seat 13 in said primary hinge may gradually be raising from the lowest 0 point to either clockwise or counter clockwise direction because of the steel balls 232 under said axle 23 able to roll upwards to both directions therefore, the door 4 can be opened to either direction, and can return to zero post ion automatically. 2 . At the positions of 00, 900 or other suitable position along the groove 131 of said axle seat 13 of said primary hinge, a ball socket 132 is furnished therefore, said steel ball 232 under the axle 23 may be positioned4oherein by falling into said socket 132 , i.e., the door may be positioned at said O point after being closed, or may be opened for a long 0 time at 90 or larger angle point after being opened without being closed by the normal flowing air. 3 . The groove 131 and the retarding pin 134 or V shaped groove 136 of the stair case shaped axle seat 13 have a retarding effect to said steel ball 232 during said ball rolling downwards, i.e., during the door 4 being closed for buffer purpose. 4 . Either the left and right side primary hinge pieces 1, 2 or the left and right side secondary hinge pieces 5, 6 are easy to be assembled or disassembled. During assembling, just put the left side primary and secondary hinge pieces 1, 5 on the jamb 3 , and right sight primary and secondary pieces 2, 6 on the door 4 in addition, it is easy to perform maintenance as well. 5 . In said secondary hinge, an inner and outer eccentric axle bushes 54, 55 are furnished so as to have the axis of said secondary hinge always automa tically aligned in a co axis with that of said primary hinge in order to maintain a smooth operation in opening or closing the door 4 .
