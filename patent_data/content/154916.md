# Enzyme immunofluorescent assay for anti treponemal antibodies.

## Abstract
A method for the determination of anti treponemal anti body in a test sample comprises contacting a substrate for the anti treponemal antibody with sample treating the con tacted substrate with labeled antihuman Ig antibody select ed from a a mixture comprising enzyme labeled antihu man Ig antibody and fluorescent labeled antihuman Ig anti body, b antihuman Ig antibody labeled with an enzyme and a fluorescent label, and c fluorescent labeled antihu man Ig antibody to which enzyme labeled antibody against the animal species from which the antibody used in the fluo rescent labeled antibody was derived is added subsequent ly, and d enzyme labeled antihuman Ig antibody to which fluorescent labeled antibody against the animal species from which the antibody used in the enzyme labeled antibo dy was derived is subsequently added determining the en zyme activity of the treated substrate and determining the immunofluorescent patterns in substrates exhibiting en zyme activity. The method is useful for the rapid screening of anti treponemal antibodies for the diagnosis of syphilis.
