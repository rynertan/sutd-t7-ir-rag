# Production of a diallyl ester of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid.

## Abstract
Known catalysts for producing a diallyl ester of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly a diallyl ester of an aromatic symmetrical dicarboxylic acid, by heating an ester of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid with an allyl alcohol to effect ester exchange, suffer from low catalytic activity and a tendency to cause formation of by products and coloura tion of the product. These problems can be overcome by effecting reaction in the presence of, as catalysts, both A at least one organic tin compound of the formula I
