# Vinyl resin composition containing silyl groups and a paint comprising said composition.

## Abstract
A composition comprising 100 parts by weight of a vinyl resin, and 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of a curing catalyst. The vinyl resin has a backbone chain composed substantially of a vinyl polymer, includes in each molecule at least one silyl group of which silicon links to a hydrolyzable group or groups, and contains 0.1 to 20 by weight of a carboxylic acid amide having a polymerizable group as a component of the polymer.
