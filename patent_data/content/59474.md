# Method and tool for manufacturing a spiral element for a scroll member used in scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
In a manufacturing method and tool of scroll member used in scroll type fluid displacement apparatus, in order to reduce waste metal, used energy and time in machining operation subsequent to a molding operation, a molding member which has a first involute groove and a second involute groove at its side surface and an insertion member which should be disposed in the first involute groove are used in the molding operation. The sectional configuration of the first involute groove is formed in wedge shape and, sectional configuration of the second involute groove is formed substantially in rectangular shape. The insertion member has a wedge shape cross section. A metal of which the spiral element of preformed scroll member is made is fulfilled in the second involute groove for metal forming. After metal forming, the insertion member is removed from the first involute groove and the formed metal member is taken out from the second involute groove. The preformed scroll member with rectangular cross section is thereby obtained. Another molding member which has a circular indenta tion at its axial end surface is used. This molding member is disposed on the end surface of first molding member for covering the both involute grooves. The space of indentation consists of the forming space. Therefore, metal filling up the forming space of indentation forms the end plate of pre formed scroll member. The first moulding members has a plurality of holes each of which is placed on the locus of involute curve and connects between the bottom surface of first involute groove and opposite side surface of first moulding member. The insertion member has a plurality of pins at the axial end surface thereof. When the insertion member is disposed in the first involute groove, each of the pins is inserted in the each hole of the moulding member and the axial outer end portion of pin extends from the hole. The insertion member is, therefore, easily removed from the first involute groove by pushing up the pins.
