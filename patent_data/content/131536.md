# Chromium boron surfaced nickel iron base alloys.

## Abstract
Chromium boron diffusion coatings on nickel iron alloys uniquely provide them with improvement in high cycle fatigue strength up to 30 and erosion resistance up to 15 times , compared to uncoated alloy. The diffused chromium layer extends in two essential concentration zones to a total depth of about 40 10 ‚Å∂ m, while the succeeding boron layer is limited to 50 90 of the depth of the richest Cr layer nearest the surface. Both coatings are applied using conventional pack diffusion processes.
