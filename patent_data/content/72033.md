# AIR FLOW RATE MEASURING DEVICE AND AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE USING THE SAME

## Abstract
An air flow rate measuring device for use with an internal combustion engine in which a signal accurately representing the air flow rate of intake air in an intake air passage 1 of the engine is always available. A first signal V₄ is generated which is dependent upon the frequency of vortex generation in a vortex stream in the intake air passage 1 . A second signal V₅ is ge nerated which is dependent upon an average air flow rate in the intake air passage 1 . By using these signals together, an accurate indication of the air flow rate in the intake air passage 1 is continuously provided.
