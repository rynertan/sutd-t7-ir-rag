# HYBRID PLASMID AND MICROORGANISM CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
A hybrid plasmid comprising a tryptophan promoter and β galactosidase gene, e.g., pTREZI, contained in a host microorganism such as E. coli can produce β galactosidase in large amounts and can be used for searching new promoters or for detecting the expression activity of foreign genes.
