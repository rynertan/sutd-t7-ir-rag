# ARRANGEMENT OF A SIGHTING MARK AND A LIGHT PRODUCING SOURCE OF ENERGY THEREFOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement of a sighting mark 2 and a light producing source of energy 3 therefor in an optical sighting instrument, especially a telescopic sighting tube. The invention is characterised in that at least one light emitting capsule 3f , preferably at least one β ray transmissive capsule enclosing a β ray producing substance, is mounted in the telescopic sighting tube at a point on a circle which is centered on the longitudinal axis of the sighting instrument and disposed at an axial distance of between about 0 and 2 r counted from a plane which is perpendicular to said axis and passes through the centre of the sighting mark 2f , the distance to said centre not exceeding 2 r, where r is the radius from said centre to the periphery of the light opening in the sighting tube 12 at the level of said plane said capsule 3f , whether it is mounted spaced from or in said plane, being positioned and directed to send at least a substantial proportion of the radiation from the capsule onto the slighting mark to make the latter luminous.
