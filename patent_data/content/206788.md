# Production of crystalline hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method of purifying hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ester represented by the struc tural formula I having a crystalline structure which, when subjected to Cu Kα X ray diffraction, shows sharp X ray dif fraction peaks at angles of diffraction, 2ϑ 2.8 , 2ϑ 8.7 and 2ϑ 11.7 , characterized in that the ester is recrystallized at a crystallization temperature lower than 40 C using as a recrystallization solvent a C₅ C₁₀ alicyclic hydrocarbon I which may contain not more than 5 wt. of at least one sol vent II selected from C₁ C₈ alcohols II 1 , C₃ C₈ carboxylic acid C₁ C₄ alkyl esters II 2 , C₁ C₃ aliphatic halides II 3 , C₆ C₁₄ aromatic chlorides II 4 , C₃ C₁₃ ketones II 5 , C₂ C₃ aliphatic nitriles II 6 , C₂ C₆ glycols or C₂ C₆ glycol C₁ C₄ alkyl ethers II 7 , C₆ C₁₄ aromatic hydrocarbons II 8 and C₄ C₆ ethers II 9 , or a mixed solvent comprising C₅ C₁₀ aliphatic hydrocarbon III and at least one solvent II selected from II 1 to II 9 , the weight ratio of III to II being 1000 to 5 100.
