# Method and system for adaptive automatic discrete utterance recognition.

## Abstract
Adaptive training of a system for discrete utterance recognition during continuous speech permits single prototype utterances to be adapted to the needs of the talker, during operation, without tedious multiple recitation for training of prototypes. Initial training of the recognition system is by a single ut terance or simulation of a prototype vocabulary. Operation proceeds, so long as utterances are recognized, until an unrecognized utterance is detected. The system then prompts a choice of prototype vocabulary keyword can didates, which the talker may then choose and utter. The system then calculates and reviews the recognition distance values, and from this review determines whether to retry or to replace the prototype by the prototype vocabu lary keyword candidate thus training the system to accept the special speech patterns of the individual talker.
