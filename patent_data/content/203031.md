## Description
Somatostatin is a cyclic tetradecapeptide which inhibits the secretion of pituitary growth hormone. Several analogs of somatostatin have been previously described. In general, the abbreviations used herein for designating the amino acids and the protective groups are based on recommendations of the IUPAC IUB Commission of Biochemical Nemenclature, see The present invention relates to analogs of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin. More particularly, this invention relates to octapeptide somatostatin analogs of the formula I Further, the present invention encompasses the novel intermediates which are the reduced forms of the compounds of formula I and methods and compositions utilizing these novel octapeptides for the treatment of various mammalian disorders. These octapeptides inhibit the release of such hormones as growth hormone, prolactin, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin, as well as diminish gastrin stimulated secretion of gastric acid. These effects may be independent of the administration of other physiologically active compounds or as an effect of the combination of the subject composition with other physiologically active compounds. The octapeptides of the present invention can thus be used for the treatment of such disease states as diabetic retinopathy, diabetes, ulcers, acute pancreatitis and acromegaly. In addition, where the growth of oncogenic tissue is affected by one of the hormones regulated by octapeptides, these octapeptides may be useful in the treatment of such tumors. Such tumors are those such as prostatic adenocarcinomas, mammary carcinomas influenced by prolactin and growth hormone as well as insulinomas, gastrinomas, growth hormone and insulin dependent tumors such as chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas as well as pancreatic ductal and acina tumors pancreatic carcinomas dependent of gastrointestinal hormones. The octapeptides of the present invention are encompassed by the above formula I. These octapeptides exist in a cyclic form due to a bridge between the C and C substituents. This bridge may be a disulfide bridge S S , a carbon sulfur bridge C S , a carbon carbon bridge C C or an amido bridge CO NH depending on the method of formation. The reduced forms of the octapeptides of formula I are encompassed by formula I below. These reduced forms are intermediates in the process for preparing the compounds of formula I. Of the compounds of formula I, certain combinations of substituents are preferred. For instance, compounds wherein C is Cys, X is Phe, Z is D Trp, Y is Thr, and C is Cys compounds wherein C is Cys, X is Tyr, Z is D Trp, Y is Val and C is Cys X is Phe, Y is Thr, and C is Cys and compounds wherein C is Cys, X is Tyr, Y is Val, and Cys are preferred compounds. The octapeptides of this invention are obtainable in the form of the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically or therapeutically acceptable acid addition salt. The octapeptides in the form of the free bases are readily obtainable from the corresponding acid addition salt by conventional methods, for example, a solution of the acid addition salt is passed through an anionic exchange resin OH form to obtain the free base. The free base can also be obtained from the acetic addition salt by repeated lyophilization of the latter salt from aqueous solution. The acetic acid addition salt is readily obtainable from another acid addition salt by treatment with the appropriate ion exchange resin, for example, Sephadex G 15 using 50 acetic acid in the manner described by The octapeptides of this invention can be obtained in the form of a pharmaceutically or therapeutically acceptable acid addition salt either directly from the process of this invention or by reacting the peptide with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid. Examples of preferred non toxic salts are those with pharmaceutically or therapeutically acceptable organic acids, The octapeptides of this invention can be prepared by solid phase synthesis. The synthesis begins at the C terminal end of the peptide. The first protected amino acid is linked to the benzhydrylamine resin by reaction of the carboxyl group protected amino acid in the presence of N, N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide and 1 Hydroxybenzotriazole HOBT . The sequential building of the peptide involves the stepwise addition of each amino acid in the N terminal portion of the peptide chain. The cleavage of the N terminal protecting group is accomplished by using trifluoroacetic acid. The other protecting groups present on the peptide chain are stable under the conditions of the cleavage of the N terminal protecting group. Once the N terminal deprotection has been effected, the product which results normally will be in the form of the addition salt of trifluoroacetic acid. The free terminal amino compound is formed by treating with a mild base, typically a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. The peptide resin is then ready for the coupling with the next amino acid which has a free carboxyl but which is protected at the alpha amino group. Once the desired amino acid sequence is prepared, the resulting peptide is removed from the resin support. This is accomplished by the treatment of the peptide resin with hydrogen fluoride. The hydrogen fluoride cleaves the peptide from the resin and, in addition, it cleaves all remaining protecting groups except formyl group of Trp. This treatment of hydrogen fluoride is carried out in the presence of m cresol and anisole which are found to inhibit the potential alkylation of certain amino acids present in the peptide chain. When the cleavage reaction is accomplished, the product is obtained in the reduced form, Although the selection of the particular protecting groups to be employed in preparing the compounds of this invention remains a matter well within one ordinarily skilled in the art, it should be recognized that the proper selection of the protecting groups is dependent upon the particular succeeding reactions which must be carried out. Thus, the protecting group of choice must be one which is stable both to the reagents and under the conditions employed in the succeeding steps of the reaction sequence. For example, as already discussed hereinabove, the particular protecting group employed must be one which remains intact under the conditions which are employed for cleaving the alpha amino protecting group of the terminal amino acid residue of the peptide fragment in preparation for the coupling of the next succeeding amino acid fragment to the peptide chain. It is also important to select as protecting group, one which will remain intact during the building of the peptide chain and which will be readily removable upon completion of the synthesis of the desired octapeptide product. All of these matters are well within the knowledge and understanding of one ordinarily skilled in the art. The octapeptides produced by the process of this invention, as well as their corresponding pharmaceutically or therapeutically acceptable acid addition salts, are useful due to their possession of the pharmacological activity of the natural tetradecapeptide somatostatin. Such activity is demonstrated readily in pharmacological tests such as a modification of the The ability of the octapeptides of this invention to inhibit hormone release The Factorial statistical analyses and calculation of potencies in 4 point design assays were carried out by the method of Bliss and Marks Bliss, C.I. and Marks H.P. Quart. J. Pharm. and Pharmacol. Factorial statistical analyses and calculation of potencies in 4 point design assays were carried out by the method of Bliss and Marks Bliss, C.I. and Marks H.P. Quart. J. Pharm. and Pharmacol. In order to determine the time course of the compounds of this invention, male rats are anesthetized with Nembutal and injected with saline or the test octapeptide as in the growth hormone potency assay above. Blood is collected from the jugular vein 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes post subcutaneous above. This time course experiment for octapeptides on growth hormone release The octapeptides of the present invention are also compared to synthetic somatostatin for their ability to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon Plasma glucagon is determined by the method of In the test systems described above, the octapeptides of the present invention were found to inhibit insulin release In diabetic patients who do not produce insulin, by inhibiting growth hormone and glucagon secretion by employing the octapeptides of the present invention, the dose of insulin should be reductible to 1 4 1 3 of that required by the patient in the absence of octapeptides. This is supported by the work of In some patients, after removal of the hypophysis and after bromocryptine treatment, an elevated growth hormone level is still observed. Utilizing the octapeptides of the present invention, in combination with bromocryptine or another similarly effective drug, the growth hormone level is reduced. In additon, LHRH agonists, which given chronically lead to paradoxical inhibitory effects, can also be used. A combined hormonal treatment consisting of octapeptides, LH RH analogs and bromocryptine can be used for the treatment of acromegaly, while similar combination treatments are useful for other neoplasmas. When the tumors are hormone dependent and these hormones are inhibited by octapeptides, these tumors can be treated with octapeptides. For example, murine and other mammalian chondrosarcomas are growth hormone dependent. The measurement of antitumor activity of the octapeptides of this invention in an animal mammary cancer model is as follows Several hormone dependent mammary tumors in rats and mice have been shown to be estrogen dependent and or prolactin dependent In order to determine activity on pancreatic carcinoma, animal models of pancreatic cancer with acinar and ductal phenotypic characteristics are used.
