# Local network interface for use in multi station word processing system and a data communications network.

## Abstract
A local network interface for use in a network for enabling each of a plurality of data processing stations 50, 58 to communicate with one another via a communications medium 52 . The local network interface is connected between the communications medium 52 and the data processing stations 50, 58 . The local network interface includes a processor 10 , a direct memory access DMA controller 12 connected to the processor 10 , means 14, 36 for controlling communications connected between the communications medium 52 and the processor 10 , and memory means 16 which is connected to the processor 10 , to the means 14, 36 for controlling communications, and to the DMA controller 12 . Data residing in the memory means 16 may be accessed for transmission to, and may be updated from, the communications medium 52 via the local network interface.
