An apparatus for the balance training of athletes, such as downhill skiers, is disclosed, and which comprises a base 12 adapted to rest upon the floor, and a foot plate 14 mounted in spaced relation above the base. The foot plate 14 and base 12 are interconnected by a plurality of springs 22 disposed in a circular arrangement around the center of the foot plate so as to permit tilting of the foot plate relative to the base in all directions. Drive means is also provided for imparting a contin uous irregular tilting movement to the foot plate 14 , and which includes an electric motor 15 , a vertical centerpost 18 connected to the output of the motor, an undulating cam plate 28, 29 fixed to the underside of the foot plate 14 , and a follower 32 fixed to the centerpost via a lever arm 30 . Thus upon operation of the motor 15 , the centerpost 18 is rotated and a continuous irregular tilting movement is imparted to the foot plate 14 .
