# Heat sealable polypropylene blends and methods for their preparation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to blends of polypropylene and styrene terpene copolymers which provide biaxially oriented, corona discharge treated, heat sealable films use ful in the packaging art. Preferably the compositions also contain saturated fatty amide, e.g., stearamide slip agent and or a Fischer Tropsch wax. A process is described in which the films, after biaxial orientation, are treated by a corona discharge and in some cases heat aged prior to use in the packaging art.
