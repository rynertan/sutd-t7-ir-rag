# SLEEPING DRIVER WARNING DEVICE FOR VEHICLE.

## Abstract
A warning device for a vehicle, comprising a steering angle detector 10 for generating steering angle pulses S₂, S₃ responsive to the steering direction of the steering angle every time the steering angle exceeds a predetermined angle, a sleeping driver detection circuit 16 for judging a normal state when the steering angle is increased larger than a predetermined angle in the steering direction represented by the steering angle pulses and generating an alarm signal S₄ upon detection of the fact that the steering operations less than the predetermined angle are conducted in the different steering direction from the steering direction more times than a predetermined frequency, and an alarm unit 26 for generating a visual or sound alarm in response to the alarm signal. This warning device can accurately detect the sleeping driver, generate an alarm and wake him up.
