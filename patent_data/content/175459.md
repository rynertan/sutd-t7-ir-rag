# Regulation of pyrolysis methane concentration in the manufacture of graphite fibres.

## Abstract
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, graphite fibres are grown on a suitably nucleated ceramic surface by passing a methane gas stream over the surface at an elevated tempera ture. Initially, the methane concentration in the gas stream is adjusted to between 5 and 15 volume percent to form micro scopic carbon filaments. Thereafter, the methane concentra tion is increased to above 25 volume percent to thicken the fila ments into fibres.
