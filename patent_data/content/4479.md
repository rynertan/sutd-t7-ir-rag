# Improvements in and relating to electronic amplifier circuit arrangements.

## Abstract
A push pull amplifier arrangement for driving a radio transmitter is shown. It comprises two high power transistors 5 and 6 connected in push pull through the primary 8 of an output transformer 10 . The base emitter circuit of each transistor has a separate and independent input drive circuit comprising an input circuit 28 and a transformer 20 for one transistor 5 and an input circuit 28A and a transformer 20A for the other transistor 6 . The transistors are biased to operate in Class AB. The use of separate drive circuits for the two transistors considerably reduces distortion. The impedance circuits 28 and 28A assist in reducing distortion and may be frequency dependent.
