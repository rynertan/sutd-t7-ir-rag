## Description
PERFLUOROCARBON EMULSIONS AND THEIR PREPARATION AND USE IN THERAPYBackground of the Invention This invention relates to the sensitization of hypoxic tumor cells to therapy, and in particular to methods, compositions and systems for sensitizing hypoxic tumor cells to radiation and or to certain chemotherapeutic agents, whether the therapy is employed alone or in combination with agents which protect normal tissues from injury. The , invention further relates to diagnostic methods in support of the sensitization and therapy. For convenience of expression in this specification the following or similar terms are sometimes abbreviated as indicated PFC perfluoro compound RS radiosensitization or radio sensitizing RT radiotherapy or radio therapeutic CT chemotherapy or chemotherapeutic RIP radioprotection or radioprotective CTP chemotherapeutic protective RI t radio imaging Oxygen deficient hypoxic cells can be up to about three times more resistant to radiation than are welloxygenated cells. These cells are relatively common in tumors but are rare in normal tissues, thereby giving the tumor cells a greater resistance to radiation than one observes in normal tissues.As a consequence, one often cannot deliver enough radiation to eradicate the tumor. cells without incurring an unacceptably high risk of severe injury to normal tissue. These same hypoxic cells are often resistant to those forms of chemotherapy which are oxygen dependent. In such chemotherapy, however, oxygen must often be supplied to the hypoxic cells for another reason in addition to maximal cell destruction hypoxic cells are not actively growing multiplying and many of the more effective chemotherapeutic drugs cannot kill the cells unless they are growing. Further, hypoxic cells have low energy reserves and are thus believed less able to actively transport certain chemotherapeutic drugs across their membranes. The following contribute to the relatively common occurrence of hypoxic cells in tumors the tumors outgrow their blood supply blood flow through the vessels in the tumor is sluggish and the tumor cells near the blood vessels consume large amounts of oxygen, thereby even further reducing the amount available to more distant cells. If means could be developed to re oxygenate these hypoxic areas one would expect large increases in radiosensitivity because the hypoxic tumor regions are near the minimum of oxygen dependent radiosensitivity. The same does not hold true for normal tissues, since, under natural conditions, they are already near the maximum for oxygen dependent radiosensitivity.The same or similar considerations also apply in sensitizing cells to chemotherapy a An obvious approach to reversing the resistance of hypoxic cells to treatment is to directly supply the cells with more oxygen. This was initially attempted by injecting hydrogen peroxide which would hopefully release oxygen at the tumor site. The technique has never achieved practicality, however, due to the toxicity of injected hydrogen peroxide. A potentially less toxic, but similarly direct approach, involved having the patient breath 100 oxygen at 3 atmospheres pressure both before and during radiotherapy.While at least some results were encouraging, the toxicity of hyperbaric oxygen treatments has limited the use of this technique to sub optimal treatments, i.e., fewer but larger radiation doses. A third direct approach was initially tested byBelgrad et al Radiology 133 235 237, 1979 . These investigators oxygen saturated a pure sample of perfluorooctyl bromide, known as a highly efficient oxygen carrier, and injected the oxygenated, neat compound into mice bearing theP388 leukemia. Twenty four hours later they exposed the mice to graded doses of whole body X rays, and compared the survival time of these mice to similarly treated mice which had received an injection of a salt solution. The results of these studies failed to show a significant improvement in therapy, and local toxic reactions in the peritoneal cavity were observed. The Belgrad et al study is not useful as a guide or suggestion of the use of perfluorooctyl bromide or otherPFC in hypoxic tumor cell therapy. The study has little clinical relevance, and discourages further studies leading to clinical investigations. One would never consider flooding as opposed to local administration the peritoneal cavity with a pure PFC or even a PFC in emulsified form.Further, oxygenation of a PFC prior to administration coupled with radiation treatment 24 hours after administration offers almost no opportunity for the leukemic cells to be sensitized to radiation. Lastly, the highest irradiation doses reported by Belgrad et al are known to be lethal to mice, and thus leave open to conjecture whether the perfluorooctyl bromide had any sensitizing effect at all under such conditions. In attempts to sidestep oxygen delivery as the primary mode of radiosensitization, radiations have been used which are less dependent on the oxygenation status of the cell for their cell killing efficiency a Such radiations are densely ionizing or high LET radiations and have been limited, however, by their unfavorable focusing characteristics. Normal tissues receive more of these radiations per unit dose delivered to the tumor than is the case with conventional radiations, and this factor has counterbalanced the expected advantage due to independence of oxygenation state. Another radiosensitization technique for avoiding gross oxygenation is the use of drugs which mimic the presence of oxygen but which can diffuse further into the tumor because they are less readily consumed by the cells traversed.Typical of such drugs are metronidazole, misonidazole and the nitroimidazole compounds disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,241,060 and 4,282,232. Such drugs, while initially promising, have not produced large therapeutic gains clinically because the drug doses required to produce significant radiosensitization also produce unacceptable neurotoxicity in patients. Hypoxia is invariably found in carcinoma and sarcoma but even in benign conditions where the hypoxic cell tumors are not continually increasing in mass , radiotherapy and or chemotherapy are sometimes prescribed in order to forestall cancerous conditions. The present invention is therefore applicable both to malignant and benign hypoxic tumor cells. As indicated in Belgrad et al, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are known which are good oxygen carriers and some have been used as blood substitutes. Nevertheless, this property alone cannot make these useful as sensitizing agents in radiotherapy and or oxygen dependent chemotherapy. In addition to good oxygen transfer capability such compounds, for effective RS and or CTS effect, must 1. Be capable of rapid transfer to the dense cell populations characterizing toxic tumDr cells or to the vasculet ture thereof, and of releasing oxygen to these cells 2e Exhibit favorable residence time in a mammalian systemic, as cpposed to too rapid elimination by excretion, transpiration or metabolism, and as opposed to undue accumulation in the system as in the liver and spleen and 3. Exhibit no toxicity or tolerable toxicity to normal euoxic cells. Ideally, the oxygen transfer compound,. if used systemically, will diffuse quickly through the vasculature, pick up oxygen in the lungs, remain in the cardiovascular system for about 10 to 12 days, to permit periodic irradiation at controlled dosages and then be rapidly eliminated, while producing no intolerable toxicity. Under such conditions sensitization to radiotherapy and or chemotherapy can be maximized. However, residence times as short as 2 to 8 hours may be sufficient if only short term therapy is necessary. Hence, considerable leeway should be possible in treatment protocols, depending on the types, state of division and site of the tumor cells, and other considerations known to therapists, such as type of irradiation or chemotherapeutic agent, side effects, and mode of administration.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention effective sensitization of hypoxic tumor cells, as a prelude to highly beneficial radiotherapy and or oxygen dependent chemotherapy, is achieved by contacting the cells or vasculature thereof with an oxygen carrying perfluoro compound, wherein the perfluoro compound is uniformly dispersed in small particle size in an aqueous medium. The resulting aqueous dispersion is rendered isotonic Cor otherwise physiologically acceptable to mammalian cells prior to use as a sensitizing agent by the addition of salts, buffering agents or other reagents known to be effective for this purpose. In one aspect of the invention the dispersion is injected intravenously, is carried through the lungs where it picks up oxygen, and then penetrates the region of the hypoxic tumor cells. The oxygen transferred from the perfluoro compound to the hypoxic cells sensitizes the cells. Simultaneously with the sensitization or thereafter, the cells are irradiated and or a CT agent is administered.Cell destruction or reduced rate of growth can be monitored by biopsy, radioimaging or other technique.. Growth as used herein means cell multiplication control of growth or similar term means cell destruction or decreased growth rate.l In another aspect of the invention, the hypoxic tumor cells are oxygenated hyperbarically but at oxygen pressures and or for periods substantially less severe than conventionally employed for treatment of hypoxia, and contact of the cells or vasculature thereof with the perfluoro compound thus supplements oxygen transfer to the cells. This enhanced sensitization is then followed or accompanied by irradiation or chemotherapy in the conventional manner. In still another diagnostic aspect of the invention, penetration of the perfluoro compound into the regions of the hypoxic tumor cells is monitored by systemic administration of a perfluoro compound which also has radiopaque properties, thereby permitting radioimaging. A variation of this approach is to incorporate into a dispersion containing an oxygen carrying perfluoro compound which does not have radioimaging properties, another compound which is an RI agent, thereby rendering the hypoxic cells susceptible to radioimaging. In other aspects of the invention, RP and or CTP agents are combined with the oxygen carrying PFC in the dispersion, or are separately delivered to the site of the hypoxia, in order to afford additional therapeutic response.This effect is achieved through the ability of the perfluoro compound to sensitize the tumor cells, while the RP and CTP agents, since they are not absorbed by the tumor cells, shield the normal tissues from attack by radiation and theCT agents, respectively. In some cases the same agent can be both radioprotective and chemotherapeutic protective. The term mammal or similar term as used throughout this specification is intended in its broad and equivalent sense to mean and include all animals. Detailed Description The Sensitizer Dispersions The sensitizing agent of the invention is an aqueous dispersion of an oxygen carrying perfluoro compound and a dispersant surfactant or emulsifier which is effective for uniformly dispersing the perfluoro compound in the aqueous medium. The dispersant is required because the perfluoro compounds are relatively hydrophobic and would otherwise tend to agglomerate in the mammalian body fluids through which the compound must pass and which serve to carry the compound to the hypoxic tumor cells or vasculature thereof. Thus, although the perfluoro compound in the neat state might initially be injectable into the body, in a short time its tendency to agglomerate would impede its use as a sensitizer.The aqueous dispersion medium also permits addition of reagents for rendering the dispersion isotonic or otherwise physiologically acceptable to the cells. Generally, the perfluoro compounds and dispersions thereof useful in this invention are those materials identified in the patent and other technical literature as synthetic blood substitutes. Representative of the patent literature disclosing such blood substitutes are U.S. Patents 3,641,167, 3,823,091, 3,911,138, 3,962,439, 3,993,581, 4,041,086, 4,105,798, and 4,325,972, the disclosures of which are incorported herein by reference. It will be apparent from a review of the foregoing patents and other literature that a wide variety of perfluorinated compounds when suitably dispersed in an aqueous medium can be used for the purposes of the present invention.The perfluoro compounds thus include aliphatic Cacyclic or cyclic and aromatic compounds, whether perfluorinated hydrocarbons only or also containing heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur and or nitrogen, and may be used singly or as mixtures of two or more. The selection of perfluoro compound for use in specific cases in accordance with the invention will depend on a variety of factors, including whether the treatment is in conjunction with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both the character and locus of the hypoxia the potency of the perfluoro compound as a sensitizer toxicity of the perfluoro compound to normal cells and to the host mammal capability of forming sufficiently small particle size dispersions and sufficient ly stable dispersions to diffuse rapidly to the region of the hypoxic cells residence time in the mammal, including accurnmulation tendencies and similar considerations familiar to those knowledgeable in the sensitization art. Guidance for such selection can be obtained from the blood substitute art, particularly as to oxygen transport capability, dispersion particle size and stability, mammalian residence time, and cytotoxicity. Additionally, on the basis of the in vitro and in vivo studies reported and discussed hereinafter, guidance is provided for selection of perfluoro compound and treatment parameters in specific cases of sensitization. Perfluoro compound or perfluorocarbon as used herein refers to a substantially fluorinated or completely fluorinated material which is generally but not necessarily a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. Substantially fluQrsnated as used herein means that most of the hydrogen atoms of a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms, such that further replacement does not substantially increase the oxygen transport capability of the material.It is believed that this level is reached when at least about 80 90 of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms. However, it is preferred that at least 95 of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced, more preferably at least 98 and most preferably, 1008. In the aforementioned U.S. Patents 3,911,138 and 4,105,798, the ability to transport oxygen is related to the solubility in the materials of a gas such as oxygen. These patents suggest that the perfluorinated materials will absorb 10 100 cc of oxygen per 100 cc of material at 250C. and 760 milliliters of mercury. Representative of the perfluoro compounds preferred for use in this invention are the perfluorinated derivatives of chemically inert Cg Cl8 polycyclic compounds such as bicyclononanes e.g., bicyclo 13.3.1 nonane, 2,6 dimethylbicyclo 13.3.11 nonane, 3 methylbicyclo 3.3.11 nonane and trimethylbicyclo t3.3.13 nonane adamantane and alkyl C1 C6 adamantanes such as methyl and dimethyl adamantane, ethyl and diethyladamantane, trimethyladamantane, ethylmethyladamantane, ethyldimethyladamantane and triethyladamantane methyldiadamantane and trimethyldiadamantane methyl and dimethylbicyclooctanes tetrahydrobinor S, pinane, camphane, decalin and alkyl decalins such as 1 methyldecalin and l ,4,6,9 dimethanodecalin bicyclo 14, 3,23 undecane, bicyclo 5.3.0 decane, bicyclo 2.2.1 octane, trìcyclo 5.2.1.02 6 decane, methyltricyclo 5.2.1,02 6 decane, and the like or any mixtures thereof.Hetero atom perfluoro compounds include F tributyl amine, F tripropyl amine andF N,N dimethylcyclohexylmethylamine perfluoro ethers such as F 2 butyltetrahydrofuran, F 2 butylfuran, F hydrofuran, the 1,2,2, 2 tetrafluoromethyl ether of F 2,5,8 trimethyl 3,6,9 trioxa 1 dodecano0, F N methyldecahydroquinoline, F l methyloctahydroquinolizine, F octahydroquinolidine and F N cyclohesylpyrrolidine. Aromatic and aliphatic compounds include F napEthalene, F l methyl naphthalene, F n methylmorpholine, F n heptane and 1,2 bis nonylfluorobutylethylene, Certain of the fluorine atoms of the foregoing materials may be substituted by other halogen atoms such as bromine.Included among these compounds, are, for example, monobrominated compounds such as l bromopentadeca fluoro 4 isopropylcyclohexane, l bromotridecafluoro hexane, l bromo pentadecafluorooctane and l bromo pentadecafluoro 3isopropylcyclopentane and perfluoro 1 bromobutyli sopropyl ether, or polybrominated derivatives thereof. When bromo or iodo atoms appear in the perfluoro compounds, the compounds tend to be radiopaque while also retaining a large measure of their oxygen transporting capabilities. The radiopacity renders these compounds useful as radioimaging RI agents, and therefore these compounds in some cases can be used not only as sensitizing agents but also as RI agents, alone or in combination with other sensitizers and or RI agents. It is known that the rate of trànspiratìon of perfluorinated hydrocarbons from lower mammals is in the order tricyclics z bicyclics alkyl monocyclic paraffinics. Accordingly, where high rate of transpAration is preferred, for example when only a brief interval of irradiation is prescribed, a tricyclic perfluoro compound will be preferred over other perfluoro compounds. Conversely, if extended radiotherapy or chemotherapy is desired, therefore requiring longer sensitizer residence time, a bicyclic or monocyclic perfluoro compound might be chosen. The more preferred perfluoro compounds for use in the invention on the basis of relative inertness chemical and biological , good dispersability and residence time are the perfluoro Cg Cl8 polycyclic hydrocarbons of U.S. Patent 4,105 ,798, and particularly F dimethyladamantane, Ftrimethylbicyclononane, F tricyclo 5.2.1.02 63 decane, F methyltricyclo 15.2.1 . o2 t61 decane, F bicyclo 5.2.0 decane and F methylbicyclo 5.2.0 decane, including any isomers thereof, and mixtures of such compounds, for example mixtures of F dimethyladamantane and F trimethylbi cyc lononane, ranging from about 90 10 to 10 90 by weight. The preferred dispersants for uniformly dispersing the perfluoro compounds in an aqueous medium are the nonionic surfactants. In some compositions and systems of the invention, particularly those cases where the dispersions are used non systemically, such as in topical or local treatments, ionic or amphoteric surfactants may be used to disperse the perfluoro compounds. Because systemic treatments require careful attention to physiological acceptability of the compounds, such as isotonic character, ionic surfactants are less desirable, although it is possible to offset or moderate their ionic character by formulating the dispersions with electrolytes or other additives. Suitable nonionic surfactants include aliphatic materials such as block copolymers of ethylene oxide and.propylene oxide comprising a hydrophobic propylene oxide section combined with one or more hydrophilic ethylene oxide sections, for example the Pluronic trademark surfactants available from BASF Wyandotte, Inc. Less desirably, aromatic types may also be used, such as alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols having alkyl groups of about 7 to 18 carbon atoms and 1 to 60 or more oxyethylene units, for example heptylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, methyloctylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, dodecylphenoxypolyethoxy ethanols, and the like polyethoxyethanol derivatives of methylene linked alkylphenols sulfur containing analogs of the foregoing ethylene oxide derivatives of long chain carboxylic acids, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and the like or mixtures of acids such as are found in tall oil containing 1 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule and analogous ethylene oxide condensates of long chain or branched chain amines, such as dodecylamine, hexadecylamine, and octadecylamine, containing 1 to 60 oxyethylene groups. Naturally occurring emulsifiers or derivatives thereof are also useful. These include the alginates, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, water soluble gums such as gum arabic and gum tragacanth, the phospholipids Csuch as lecithin and yolk phospholipid , and the sterols. Nonionic fluorine containing surfactants are particularly preferred. The fluorinated alkyl esters are one class of these surfactants, and are commercially available from 3M Company under the designations FC 93, FC 95, FC 128, FC 143, FC 430 and FC 431. The more preferred nonionic, fluorine containing surfactants, from the standpoint of their exceptional ability to form dispersions which maintain a range of small particle size over substantial periods of time, of the order of 35 weeks to a year or more, even at room temperature, are the fluorinated amidoamine oxides described in U.S.Patents 3,828,085 to Price et al, and 3,547 995 to Bartlett, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.These compounds may be generally described by the Formula 1 EMI11.1 wherein Rf is a perfluoroalkyl radical of 4 to about 25 carbon atoms or a polyfluoroalkoxyalkyl radical wherein the alkoxy group may contain 3 to about 40 carbon atoms of which at least a major portion thereof are perfluorinated and the alkyl group may contain 2 to about 40 carbon atoms, fluorinated or unfluorinated Y is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms R is an alkylene radical of the formula cii CzE2z wherein z is an integer of 1 to 6 and Q is an aliphatic amine oxide radical of the formula EMI12.1 wherein R5 and R6 are each alkyl radicals of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or hydroxy terminated alkyl radicals of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. In all cases the alkoxy, alkyl and alkylene groups may be straight or branched chain. Preferred subclasses of the surfactants of the foregoing patents are those of the following Formulas t21 and t3 EMI12.2 wherein n is at least 3 preferably 3 10 , x is at least 2 preferably 2 61, y is at least 1 preferably 2 6 , andR1 and R2 independently are alkyl radicals containing 1 6 carbon atoms.EMI12.3 wherein n is at least Cpreferablg 3 10 , z is at least 1 preferably 2 6 , and R1 and R2 independently are alkyl radicals containing 1 6 carbon atoms. Specific amidoamine oxides within the scope of the above formula are the products described in Examples 1 6 of U.S. Patent 3,828,085, namely EMI13.1 The aqueous dispersions of the invention are prepared by any mixing technique which will provide a uniform blend of the ingredients, and preparation accordingly may be readily accomplished by the skilled formulator. When formulating the dispersions of the invention for systemic administration, it is important not only to add electrolytes and other materials to render the dispersions physiologically acceptable such as isotonic with mammalian cells , but also to adjust the pH, as necessary, to offset the lowering of the pH of the hypoxic cell environment due to generation of lactic acid by the hypoxic tumor cells. A suitable pH range is 7.2 7.4. Among the additives commonly used to render fluids physiologically acceptable are buffers such as sodium bicarbonate, and mixtures such as Ringer s Solution. Other materials conventionally employed in pharmaceutical preparations and known to the skilled formulator may also be added to the dispersions.These include viscosity modifiers, stabilizers Cagainst degradation due to freezing or contamination, for example , anti freeze agents, diluents, encoding agents, and the like.Among such additives may be mentioned glycerin, dimethylsulfoxide c DMSO , various gelatins both natural and synthetic, and polyols such as sorbitol. The perfluoro compound and surfactant components may be blended into water in any proportions which will provide uniform dispersions. Typical proportions are about 5 to 50 perfluoro compound based on the volume of the total composition and about 0.5 to 10 of the surfactant based on the total weight of the composition. Preferred proportions are about 10 30 by volume of the perfluoro compound and about 2 5 by weight of the surfactant, but proportions in particular cases may be varied depending on disperability of the PFC, particle size desired, and similar considerations. The aqueous dispersions more usually comprise emulsions, preferably of the oil in water type but also including water in oil emulsions. In some cases the emulsions have a very fine particle size and appear transparent or solution like to the unaided eye. The micro emulsions which can be formulated with the dispersants of U.S. Patent 3,828,085 have this characteristic and are preferred.Colloidal suspensions, while not excluded from use in this invention, are less preferred, particularly for systemic administration, because of their larger particle size range and less stability. The above identified blood substitute and surfactant patents provide excellent guidance to formulation of the dispersions, and attention is directed to the patents for such purpose. Sensitizing Treatment The aqueous dispersions containing the oxygen transporting perfluoro compound, when used as sensitizers in accordance with the invention, may be administered to a mammal locally or in any systemic fashion, whether intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, parenteral, intraperitoneal or oral. Preferably, administration will be systemic and at a site enabling the dispersion to traverse the lungs to pick up oxygen and to transport the oxygen to the hypoxic tumor cells. Dosages of the dispersion will be predetermined in accordance with the site and character of the hypoxia, whether or not the treatment is a supplement to hyperbaric oxygen treatment, the systemic tolerance toxicity of the mammal to the specific formulation, and other factors known to the therapist.Generally, fluorocrits cc of PFC per 100 ml blood of the perfluoro compound should be in the range of about 3 10 , although lower or higher fluorocrits in special circumstances may be sufficient or required. If the administration is a supplement to hyperbaric oxygen treatment, or other form of primary oxygen infusion, the flu x tt need not be over 3.5 , and the partial pressure of oxygen in the inspired air may be up to about 2 atmospheres at 100 oxygen. As a maximum in most cases, hyperbaric oxygen administration would be 30 minutes at 2 atmospheres 100 oxygen pressure, and these conditions are known to be well within tolerated levels.However, the duration, content and pressure of the primary oxygenation in specific cases again will depend upon various factors, such as the health. of the mammal or patient, the site of the hypoxia, and other conditions familiar to the radio or chemotherapist. Contact of the PFC dispersion may be with the hypoxic cells or with the tumor cell vasculature, such that the oxygen carried by the PFC may transfer to the tumor vasculature interface. In other words, while the ideal may be direct contact between the PFC dispersion and the hypoxic cells, this may not be achievable and in fact is not required, since excess oxygen, wherever present in the tumor mass, will tend to become distributed throughout the mass, and thus reach the hypoxic cells. The dosage of the sensitizing agent prior to irradiation and or chemotherapy will also be controlled by various conditions, including the rate at which the perfluoro compound travels to the hypoxic tumor cells, the degree of sensitization desired, and the cardiovascular half life residence time of the dispersion in the cardiovascular system and in the hypoxic tissues. For some treatments such as brief radiation treatments an acceptable cardiovascular serum half life can be as brief as about 2 to 4 hours. This duration indicates that the perfluoro compound moves rapidly to the hypoxic tumor cells and transfers its oxygen to the cells. In this connection an outstanding property of the preferred dispersions of the invention is an extremely small particle size, which particle size is maintained over substantial periods.The small particle size enables the dispersions to quickly traverse the vasculature to the site of the hypoxia. For example, an average particle size of 0.05 to 0.2 micron has been observed and has been maintained for several months and up to a year or more. The dispersions may be oxygenated prior to infusion into the mammalian body and this may be expedient when injection is at or near the site of the hypoxia rather than at a site where oxygen transfer from the lungs and arteries is anticipated. Prior oxygenation in such manner may be accomplished by any means, such as flushing or blanketing a vessel containing the dispersion with oxygen or air, or bubbling oxygen or air through the dispersion prior to administration. When the treatment is a supplement to hyperbaric oxygen treatment, preoxygenation in the manner described may also be practiced. In every case of preoxygenation, however, there may be a loss of oxygen prior to entry of the dispersion into the region of the hypoxic tumor cells, that is, during transit of the dispersion to the cells hence, preoxygenation generally is not preferred. The types, mode of application and sites of radiation treatments are well known and do not require detailed description. However, it will be evident that irradiation can be accomplished by external application or by internal placement of radiation sources near or at the site of the hypoxia. Accordingly, the irradiation may be achieved with x rays, gamma rays, neutrons and the like, or with implanted radium, iridium or cesium sources. Conventional radiation therapy 200 rads per day, five days per week for six to eight weeks may be employed but dosage and total duration of treatment may be adjusted as required in particular circumstances. The sensitizing method of the invention will be effective for all types of hypoxic tumor cells, whether such cells be in suspension as in leukemia or in solid form, but the invention is particularly effective for solid tumors.Because systemic distribution of the dispersions is rapid, primarily due to the extremely small and stable particle size of the preferred dispersions of the invention, hypoxia at practically any site may be sensitized in accordance with the invention. Chemotherapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy to destroy or control hypoxic tumor cells and therefore the sensitization techniques of the invention can be applied simultaneously or sequentially to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When dual therapy is used, a sensitizer dispersion will normally be selected which has the cardiovascular residence time effective to cover the duration of both treatments, or if the residence time is short, the sensitizer dosage can be suitably increased or adjusted.It is known that some chemotherapeutic agents are oxygen dependent in terms of requiring oxygen for active transport of the CT drug into the cell, for cell cycling control orCT enhancement. Hence, oxygen must be supplied in free form or by means of a carrier. Because the perfluoro compounds of the present invention and their dispersions are capable of transferring large quantities of oxygen, it can be expected that chemotherapy based upon drugs which are oxygen dependent will be benefited by formulating the drugs with an RS agent of the present invention, or sequentially administering the RS and CT agents. Methotrexate is an example of a CT drug thought to require oxygen for active transport into the cell. Vinblastine and Vincristine are drugs which require oxygen for cell cycling. CT drugs which may not be oxygen dependent may also be administered in conjunction with the sensitizing techniques of the invention. Among such drugs may be mentioned Androgens, Estrogens, Anti estrogen, Progestins, Adrenal Steroids, Nitrogen Mustard, Chlorambucil,Phenylalanine Mustard, Cyclophosphamide, Thio TEPA, Busulf an, 6 Mercaptopurine, 6 Thioguanine, 5 Fluorouracil,Cytosine Arabinoside, Adriamycin, Dactinomycin, Daunomycin,Bleomycin, Mithramcycin, Mitomycin C, BCNU, CCNU, Methyl CCNU, DTIC, Hydroxyurea, Cis Platinum cis platinum II diamminedichloride , Procarbazine, Hexamethylmelamine,L Asparaginase, and the like. Associated Treatments Those perfluoro compounds useful as RS agents but which also have radiopaque properties are particularly valuable for the purposes of the present invention. Such compounds include brominated perfluorohydrocarbons such asF perfluoroctylbromide and brominated perfluoroethers, such as F l bromobutylisopropylether, F l bromoethylisopropyl ether and other brominated perfluoro organo ethers described, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,453,333. The radioimaging properties of such compounds permit monitoring of their RS effects as well as toxicity to surrounding normal cells and hence serve as diagnostic agents as well as RS agents.However, if the perfluoro compounds do not also exhibit radiopacity, the dispersions containing the perfluoro compounds may be formulated with other, known, radiopaque agents in order to provide a similar opportunity for monitoring radiosensitization potential. The radioimaging may be practiced as in conventional radiography or computer axial tomography CCAT radiography, or by the newer NMR techniques. The brominated compounds as RI agents may be used neat or in aqueous dispersion, for example as oil inwater or water in oil emulsions containing about 10 90 by volume of water and about 0.5 10 by weight of a dispersant. Radioprotection may also be practiced in conjunction with the radiosensitization of the invention.Radioprotective agents are those which preferentially protect normal tissues from radiation injury. When practiced with radiosensitization, the objective is to reduce injury to the normal tissues, which injury may occur when the RS agents are used in the absence of the RP agents. Sulfhydrylcontaining agents generally are known to be effective RP ,, materials, such as aminoethylisothiuronium or the . phosphorothioate derivatives of beta mercaptoethylamine reviewed in the article by J. M. Yuhas, On the PotentialApplication of Radioprotective Drugs in Solid Tumor Radiotherapy, appearing in Radiation Drug Interactions in theTreatment of Cancer, edited by G. H. Sokol and R. P. Maickel,John Wylie and Sons, Inc. 1980 , pages 113 135. Another RP agent is S 2 C3 aminopropylamino ethylphosphorothioic acid, also described in the literature as WR 2721. This material provides protection both in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as described in the article by Yuhas et al appearing in Cancer Clinical Trials C1980 , 3, 211 216. The following examples will serve as further illustration of the invention without necessarily limiting the scope thereof. While the experimental results ofExamples 2, 4 and 7 were obtained in vitro, the sensitization demonstrated by these examples is not restricted to nonmammalian systems because the MTS studies are known to correlate with patterns of the response of the cells in mammals. Specifically, the MTS are known to respond similarly to the same tumor when grown in the mammalian body. Example 1Preparation of PFC dispe rsi ona C1 A surfactant solution was prepared by dispersing in water a sufficient amount of the following amidoamine oxide surfactant AGO to provide a 2 by weight solution EMI19.1 To the sonication chamber of a Sonicator trademark mixing device CHeat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc., Model 350 was added 27cc of the 2 surfactant solution, followed by slow addition Cover 3 4 minutes under low sonication power of 3cc to give 20 wt. or 10 vol. of a PFC composition consisting of an about 80 20 by weight liquid mixture ofF l, 3 dimethyladamantane and F trimethylbicyclo 3.3 10 nonane, to provide a total of 30cc of composition. The PFC mixture was previously saturated with C02 to inhibit formation of fluoride ions. The sonication horn was then turned up to full power setting of 10 on a scale of 1 10 for one minute followed by a cooling period.This cycle was repeated about 15 times or until such time as a transparent, uniform dispersion was obtained. The dispersion hereinafter identified as Dispersion A was then filtered through a 0.22 micron Millipore Ctrademarkl filter and kept refrigerated at 40C.until use. B A second dispersion was prepared substantially as in A above except for use of a nonionic polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymer surfactant having a molecular weight of about 8200 Pluronic F 68 in place of the AAO surfactant. This dispersion is hereinafter identified as Dispersion B. CC A third dispersion was prepared substantially as described in A above except that the PFC was Ftributylamine CFC 43, 3M Company and the surfactant was the Pluronic F 68 of B . The proportions were the same 10 vol. PFC, 2 wt. surfactant .This dispersion is hereinafter identified as Dispersion C. Example 2 In Vitro Radiosensitization Multicellular tumor spheroids MTS l are produced by placing 106 MCa ll murine mammary tumor cells in 10 mls of Eagles Basal Medium EBME 1, Grand IslandBiological Co., catalog No. 420 1200, into a 100 mm petri dish which has been base coated with 0.75 noble agar in the EBME. Within 7 10 days spherical aggregates of tumor cells appear and are then ready for study. The PFC dispersion to be tested is adjusted to 290 milliosmoles, osmolarity with powdered tissue culture medium and adjusted to pH 7.2 to 7.4 with 0.1N NaOH or HC1. Other details of preparation and use of the MTS are given in J. M.Yuhas et al, 1977, A Simplified Method For Production And Growth OfMulticellular Tumor Spheroids, Cancer Research 37 36393643 and J. M. Yuhas et al, 1978, In Vitro Analysis OfThe Response Of Multicellular Tumor Spheroids Exposed ToChemotherapeutic Agents In Vitro Or In Vivo, n Cancer Research 38 3595 3598. Either standard tissue culture medium CEBME or the PFC dispersion is gassed with 100 oxygen for a period of fifteen minutes and then transferred, along with the spheroids, into non heparinized capillary tubes and sealed.At intervals of 0 to 60 minutes later the tubes are exposed to graded doses of 250 kVp X rays, and within 30 minutes thereafter are removed, washed with medium and placed individually in agar coated 16 mm wells along with 1.5 cc of medium. Using a dissecting scope at 40 power the spheroids are sized three times weekly and the medium is changed twice weekly. From the growth curves for each group is calculated the number of days required for each spheroid to grow 200 or 150 Wm microns in diameter larger than the size at the beginning of the irradiation. The retardation of rate of growth of the spheriods shown by the data therefore provides a measure of RS response where the larger the difference over the irradiated controls the greater the RS effect.Toxicity of the PFC is evaluated in terms of growth delay, i.e., the retardation in growth of the spheroids after exposure to the PFC without irradiation relative to that observed in untreated spheroids.Table I below shows the results of experiments with Dispersions A and B and Table II shows results with Dispersion C. It will be noted that Dispersions A and B provided similar levels of toxicity and radiosensitivity. The toxicity exhibited by Dispersions A and B is considered negligible and likely to be relatively tolerable in the cardiovascular system. The toxicity exhibited by Dispersion C, although higher than that of Dispersions A and B, does not disqualify Dispersion C from use as a sensitizer in mammals such toxicity is relative to various factors, such as RS reagent and radiation dosage, and tumor type and location, and therefore Dispersion C would not necessarily be excluded from clinical evaluation. The data of Tables I and II is not directly comparable larger spheroids were used in the experiments reported in Table I than were used in the experiments reported in Table II.However, the larger spheroids provide added bias Clarger spheroids are more difficult to sensitize and therefore the results ofTable I indicate highly beneficial sensitization. On face value, it would appear that Dispersion C is a more effective radiosensitizer than either DispersionA or Dispersion B. This is in all probability not true for two reasons. The studies with Dispersion C were preliminary and involved MTS with a smaller fraction of radioresistant hypoxic cells at the time of treatment than was the case for the studies with Dispersions A and B. Second, Dispersion C was, in itself, growth inhibitory, and it is likely that this property in some way enhanced the tumor cell destruction.

Example 3 In Vivo Studies Residence Titnas The rate of clearance of PFC bispersions A and B from the circulation was evaluated in both Fisher 344 rats and BALB c mice females in both cases . The dispersions were injected intravenously to a PFC dose equal to one third of the circulatory volume, which is equal to 6 of body weight. Within 30 minutes of injection, the animal returns to the normovolemic state as evidenced by the fact that the fluorocrit equals 3.1 compared to the theoretical estimate of 3.3 for these Dispersions. At graded intervals through 8 hours after injection, blood is drawn in microcapillary tubes from the supraorbital sinus. Following centrifugation for 15 minutes at 12,000 times gravity, the fluorocrit PFC as a percent of the blood volume and the hematocrit, are read on a microscope. The PFC collects as a pellet in the bottom of the tubes, followed by the red blood cells and the plasma, thus forming distinct layers All data are normalized to the 30 minute centrifugation reading and the rate of decline of the fluorocrit is estimated from a standard single compartment exponential decay curve defined by kt PFC remaining e and T1 2 ln 2 The results when plotted show that Dispersion A is superior to Dispersion B Oialf lives of 366 minutes and 222 minutes, respectively , probably because Dispersion A has a smaller particle size than Dispersion B. The results for the rats and mice were essentially equivalent. The results indicate that the PFC in both dispersions will clear the cardiovascular system quickly, and therefore both dispersions are good candidates for clinical studies. Example 4 The MTS experiments of Example 2 were repeated in all essential respects with Dispersion B but using spheroids derived from human tumor lines which contain hypoxic cells when grown as MTS. As shown in Table III below, some toxicity was observed in all cases but the levels are considered relatively tolerable. Moderate radiosensitizing is apparent for the two neuroblastoma cell lines but very high radiosensitization is shown with respect to the melanoma line.The latter is an outstanding result due to the prevalence and high risks known for this form of hypoxic tumor cells.Very little RS effect is shown for the osteosarcoma cell line but these results are only preliminary and the exposure was at a low radiation level.

The emulsion tested was Dispersion B which was held at 40C. until use. Just prior to use the osmolarity was adjusted to approximately 300 milliosmoles with powdered tissue culture medium Eagles Basal Medium EBME , and the pH adjusted to 7.4 with HC1 or NaOH. Table IV below summarizes the results of an acute toxicity study o Fisher 344 rats in which various doses of the emulsion were injected into the tail veins of the rats. Rats reported as surviving after injection survived for at least ten days.Deaths normally occurred in 4 to 24 hours if at all. The results indicate that the animals can tolerate large doses of PFC emulsion relative to their blood volume about 60 to 80 ml kg as compared with the doses which would be administered to assess radiosensitization in vivo, normally, 20 to 30 ml kg. In LD50 I.V. tests it was determined that the lethal dosage was greater than 60 ml kg for BALB c mice and greater than 120 ml kg for the Fisher 344 rats.The observations are consistent with those reported by other investigators in that the PFC dispersion has a low acute toxicity even when administered hypervolemically at doses exceeding the animal s normal blood volume, The deaths which occurred at the high doses probably were due to fluid overload rather inherent toxicity of the PFC dispersions.

Example 6 In Vivo RadiosensitiZation Radiosensitization of the 3M2N mammary tumor growing in the right hind leg of Fisher 344 rats was studied. At 10 14 days after subcutaneous transplantation in the rats the tumors were 6 8 rnm in diameter and ready for treatment. The control animals either received no treatment or received various radiation doses. The other animals received I.V. infusion of 20 ml kg of Dispersion B 20 w v followed by 30 minutes breathing of 95 02 5 CO2 gas mixture at 1 atm and then by the various radiation doses of x rays. Prior to and three times weekly after treatment, the two orthogonal diameters of the tumors were measured in situ and averaged.Table V below expresses the results of the study as the time required for the tumors to grow 8mm beyond their size at the time of treatment. The data show that the enhancement produced by the PFC dispersion increases with radiation dose, and also that the growth delay per rad is significantly higher in the PFCtreated group than in the control. That the enhancement is due to the combination of the PFC dispersion and breathing of the gas mixture is evident from Table VI below in that none of the control treatments were capable of producing the growth delay of the combination.

Example 7 In Vitro Chemosensitiz ation The potentiation by PFC dispersions of chemotherapeutic agents was demonstrated by the anti tumor effect of methotrexate MTX in NB 100 neuroblastoma multicellular tumor spheroids MTS . In this study, the spheroids were exposed to from 0 to 5x10 molar methotrexate in control medium and in Dispersion B equilibrated with a 95 02 5 CO2 mixture. The results Table VII below show that the PFC dispersion enhanced the effectiveness of MTX as evidenced by the delay in growth relative to the spheroids treated only with MTX.Although some sensitization to MTX in these spheroids can be achieved by gassing with the gas mixture in medium alone, such sensitization requires 1 to 2 hour pretreatment as opposed to only 30 minutes with the PFC dispersion, thus clearly demonstrating the feasibility of elevating the therapeutic index of this important anti cancer drug with PFC.

Example 8 In Vivo Chemosensitization The combined use of PFC dispersion Dispersion B and high oxygen breathing for enhancement of the anti tumor effects of cyclophosphamide CYC was investigated with respect to treatment of MCa ll mammary carcinoma transplanted into the right hind leg of female BALB c mice.The tumors were allowed to grow to 2mm at which point the animals were treated as described in Table VIII below, wherein the cyclophosphamide, obtained commercially, was dissolved in distilled water and injected in a volume equal to 0.01 ml kg of body weight. Three to six animals per treatment group were used in the study. On the day of treatment and three to five times per week thereafter, the tumors were sized with vernier calipers. From the test results Table VIII , it is evident that the anti tumor effect growth delay produced by the cyclophosphamide alone absence of oxygen and or PFC dispersion was not detectably enhanced by oxygen breathing of 95 02 5 CO2 mixture or by injection of PFC dispersion followed by oxygen breathing, but was enhanced effectively by administration of PFC dispersion in concert with oxygen breathing.

Example 9 In Vivo Chemop rdtection and Chemosensitization Combined chemosensitization of hypoxic tumors to chemotherapeutic agents and protection of normal tissues is achieved by the procedure described by Yuhas et al, Treatment of Tumours with the Combination of WR 2721 andCis dichlorodiammine platinum II or Cyclophosphamide, Br.J. Cancer 1980 , 42, 574 585 and publications referenced therein, as modified by concurrent treatment with 20 ml kg of a PFC dispersion, such as Dispersion B, as described inExample 8 above, to accommodate lower dosages of the chemotherapeutic agents 75 mg kg , room air breathing, high oxygen 95 2 5 CO2 breathing, controls, and other conditions as appropriate. Example 10 In Vivo Radioprotection and Radioseneitiza tin The sensitization of hypoxic tumors to irradiation by treatment with PFC compositions of the invention in combination with radioprotection of normal tissues in the region of treatment is achieved by the procedure described by Yuhas et al, The Role of WR 2721 In Radiotherapy and orChemotherapy, Cancer Clinical Trials 1980 , 3, 211 216 and publications referenced therein, modified as described in Example 6 above to provide for concurrent infusion of 20 ml kg of a PFC composition such as Dispersion B, high oxygen 958 02 5 CO2 or air breathing, controls, and other conditions as appropriate. Delivery of Lipophilic Drugs In the course of in vitro chemosensitization studies in the LAN 1 human neuroblastoma spheroid system, conducted substantially as described in Example 4 above except for Adriamycin as the chemotherapeutic agent, it was noted that the anti tumor activity of the Adriamycin was inhibited by the PFC material PFC Dispersion B . This suggested that the PFC may have been physically binding the Adriamycin, thereby reducing the concentration available for absorption by the spheroids. This was tested by dissolving in water a radio labelled analogue of Adriamycin, C14 Daunomycin, adding Dispersion B tor in separate experiments, the neat PFC component of Dispersion B , blending for 30 minutes, separating the PFC phase from the aqueous phase, and determining the distribution of drug between the phases.Table IX below reports the results of the experiment and similar experiments with three other drugs. It will be noted that the more lipophilicDaunomycin preferentially partitioned into the PFC phase whereas the other, less lipophilic, drugs favored the aqueous phase. It was concluded that although the PFC may have an inhibitory effect on less lipophilic drugs, the delivery of lipophilic drugs will be enhanced by thePFC. Table IX BINDING OF FOUR CANCER TREATMENT DRUGS BY PFC DISPERSION Lipophilicity Drug in Emulsion f Drug Index Drug in Aqueous Phase Daunomycin 0.79 3.77 Misonidazole 0.43 0.04 Methotrexate 0.014 0.07 WR 2721 0.002 0.05 Lipophilicity index is the partition coefficient of the drug between octanol and water. The preferential solubility of lipophilic drugs in PFC compositions not only provides a means for enhancing the delivery of such drugs in animals but also opens up opportunity for controlling residence time of the drug in the animal, for example by prolonging release of the drug from PFC circulating to the plasma and target organs. In other words, by appropriate selection of a drug from the standpoint of its relative lipophilicity in a PFC dispersion, sustained low level delivery of a drug for a prolonged period is made possible with an aqueous delivery system. Example 11 Enhancement of Chemotherapy This example illustrates enhancement of anti tumor action of Vincristine, a lipophilic drug to which tumors are normally resistent at least to non lethal doses thereof.The enhancement is believed due to the preferential solubility of the drug in the PFC material. The partitioning of the Vincristine between thePFC and aqueous phases of Dispersion B was first studied in comparison with Daunomycin, as reported in Table X below, where PFC means the PFC phase of Dispersion B.

Thereafter, in vivo chemosensitization was conducted in MCa ll mammary carcinoma essentially as described in Example 8 above except as follows The MCa l1 mammary carcinoma was transplanted into the thigh of BALB c mice and grown to a diameter of 6mm, at which time the mice were treated. Control mice received an injection of saline, while Vincristine treatment consisted of a single dose of 1.5 mg kg of Vincristine administered intraperitoneally. PFC treatment consisted of an i.v. injection of 20 ml kg of Dispersion B, followed by two hours of breathing carbogen g58 2 5 CO2 , and injection of saline of Vincristine as before, followed by another two hours of carbogen breathing. It was observed that the Vincristine treatment alone had no effect on tumor growth.Similarly, administration of the PFC emulsion alone had no effects on tumor growth, but when combined with the injection of Vincristine, the growth of the tumor was delayed by approximately 5 days. Oxygen breathing was included in the experiment in order to guarantee that any stimulation of the active efflux mechanism might not override any potential benefits gained via a more advantageous delivery of drug. In vitro studies now underway indicate that the benefits of the PFC Vincristine combination are not oxygen dependent. Moreover, enhanced host toxicity of theVincristine when combined with the PFC dispersion could not be detected. Thus, it appears that PFC dispersions have the potential to deliver low levels of drugs over prolonged periods. It will also be apparent that by matching PFC materials and drugs based on their relative lipophilicity, the efficacy of drugs in a variety of treatments may be controlled. In some cases the effect may be enhancement of activity. In other cases diminished activity or prolonged activity may be the preferred result. These benefits are achievable whether or not the PFC material is also being utilized as an oxygen transporting agent.
