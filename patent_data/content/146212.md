Brief Description of the Drawings For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, in which, FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a conventionalSchottky barrier diode and FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a Schottky barrier diode embodying the present invention. In the different figures, like reference numerals denote corresponding elements. Detailed Description The conventional Schottky barrier diode shown inFIG. 1 is fabricated on a silicon wafer 2 by depositing thereon a layer of silicon dioxide 4, selectively etching the silicon dioxide to form a via 6 and through which a portion 8 of the surface of the wafer is exposed, and then depositing on the surface portion 8 a layer 10 of Schottky barrier metal, such as Pt. A layer 12 of intermediate barrier metal, such as TiW, is deposited on the wafer so that it covers the layer 10, the walls of the via 6 and a portion of the surface of the layer 4 surrounding the via 6. A layer 14 of anode metal, e.g. Al, is formed on top of the layer 12. It is well known that the most active region of the Schottky barrier diode shown in FIG. 1 is at the perimeter of the device, and that the characteristics of the diode are sensitive to the perimeter to area ratio of the device. The reverse characteristics of the device are easily degraded by reverse current stresses. This degradation occurs at the device perimeter. Two possible reasons have been advanced for this degradation, one being that the degradation is caused by physcial stress concentrations at the device perimeter due to the proximity of the oxide layer, and the other being that the degradation is caused by sharp edge effects around the diode perimeter and anMIS diode in parallel with the normal Schottky barrier diode. It is believed that these physical stresses affect the reverse bias current voltage characteristic of the device.Finally, the actual geometry of the edge of the opening has a significant effect on the characteristics of the device by varying the area and dielectric thickness of the MIS diode. FIG. 2 illustrates the major process steps of fabricating a Schottky barrier diode which is not subject to the above mentioned disadvantages of the diode illustrated in FIG. 1. FIG. 2 a illustrates the starting material for fabricating the diode, namely a silicon wafer 20. An epitaxial layer 22 of silicon having a resistivity of e.g., 0.25 ohm cm is grown on the top surface of the silicon wafer to a thickness of about 200 nm FIG. 2 b . A barrier layer 24 of MoSi2 and a barrier metal layer 26 of Tiw are deposited on top of the epitaxial layer 22, to thicknesses of 50 nm and 100 nm respectively FIG. 2 c and a layer 28 of photoresist is deposited on top of the TiW layer 26, and the photoresist is used to pattern the TiW FIG.2 d . The photoresist is then removed, and the patterned TiW is used as a mask for selective etching of the MoSi2 and the silicon to form a mesa 30 FIG.2 e . The silicon is etched to a depth greater than 200 nm, so that the boundary 32 between the epitaxial layer 22 and the wafer material 20 is above the base of the mesa. After formation of the mesa, silicon dioxide 34 is deposited over the exposed surface of the wafer and over the mesa, for example by plasma deposition, to a depth of 1,000 nm FIG. 2 f , and a via 36 is cut in the oxide using conventional selective etching techniques so as expose the TiW on top of the mesa at the central region of the mesa while leaving an annular region of TiW surrounding the central region covered FIG. 2 g . An intermediate barrier layer 38 of TiW is deposited over the patterned silicon dioxide 34 and the exposed TiW of the layer 26, to a thickness of 250 nm, and a layer 40 of Pd is deposited over the layer 38 of TiW to a depth of 40 nm FIG. 2 h . Photoresist 42 is then deposited over the layer of Pd, and is removed from over the mesa 30 and the immediately surrounding area FIG. 2 i .Gold 44 is then plated onto the exposed Pd of the layer 40 to a thickness of 1,000 nm. The remaining photoresist is removed and the layers of Pd and TiW which are not covered by the gold plating are removed by etching FIG. 2 j . In the device illustrated in FIG. 2 j , the device perimeter, at which device degradation occurs, is at the periphery of the mesa, and thus removed from the edge of the via 36, at which physical stress concentrations in the oxide 34 are high. The intermediate barrier layer 38 serves to disperse physical stress concentrations that would otherwise exist at the edge of the via. The spacing of the perimeter of the passivation via from the perimeter of the barrier layer also avoids sharp edge effects and the formation of an MIS diode in parallel with the normal Schottky diode. Finally, by using a mesa structure there are no sharply curved boundaries between the substrate and the epitaxial layer, which would cause premature breakdown of the diode under reverse bias stress. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not restricted to the particular device and method which have been described, since variations may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof. For example, it may be possible in some circumstances to avoid the need for the layer 38.
