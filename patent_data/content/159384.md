# Composition and process for foaming olefinic resin.

## Abstract
A heat foamable olefinic resin composition comprising a an ethylenic polymer, b a propylene alpha olefin copolymer having a melt ing point of 130 to 160 C, c a propylene polymer having a melting point at least 10 C higher than the melting point of the propylene alpha olefin copolymer, and d a blowing agent, and optionally e a crosslinking agent and or a crosslinking promot ing agent and a process for producing an olefinic resin foam compris ing crosslinking and heat foaming the aforesaid heat foamable olefinic resin composition.
