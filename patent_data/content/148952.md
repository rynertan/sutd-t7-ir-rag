# APPARATUS FOR DETECTING POSITION OF OBJECT BEING MEASURED.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting the position of an object being measured comprises a means which transmits and receives ultrasonic waves by an ultrasonic wave transmitter receiver element 53, 73, 93 with respect to an object 65, 82, 103 being measured, such as a small diameter hole or a narrow groove in a surface, a means 50, 72, 91 which changes the relative positional relationship between the object 65, 82, 103 and the ultrasonic wave transmitter receiver element 53, 73, 93 and a signal processing means which detects the position of the object 65, 82, 103 using changes in reflected signal intensity P₁, P₂, P₃ near the central position of the object 65, 82, 103 when the relative positional relationship is changed, thereby enabling a highly accurate detection of the position of the object.
