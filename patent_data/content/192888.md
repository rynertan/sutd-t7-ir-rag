## Description
This invention relates to a method for the production of flexible, flame retardant polyurethane foams and to novel foams obtained thereby. The term flexible as used herein includes, but is not restricted to, the categories of foams known to those skilled in the art as low resilience , conventional and high resilience foams. Flexible cellular materials have been interpreted by the International Standards Organisation I.S.O. TC.45 Cellular Plastics Committee as Cellular polymeric materials capable of significant deflection and recovery or used in applications requiring significant deflection and recovery. The physical and mechanical properties of polyurethane foams make them useful for a wide variety of applications, including upholstery and bedding. However, polyurethane foams are inherently flammable and this leads to melting and spread of burning debris and in the case of conventional foams may also lead to the sustaining of combustion by progressive smouldering even after the actual flames have extinguished. It is considered that cellular materials manufactured from flammable polymers are more flammable than the solid materials because the insulating effect of their cellular nature allows a rapid build up of heat at the heating surface with a consequent high rate of pyrolysis. In solid materials this heat build up is at a lower rate because of the higher conductivity of the solid material. Although rigid foams have similar thermal conductivity behaviour to flexible foams the high crosslinked nature of their chemical structure makes them less flammable as polymers and also inherently more inclined to form a protective char rather than to form the flaming molten polymer droplets which occur with flexible foams. Thus both solid and rigid cellular materials burn less easily than flexible foams and are easier to extinguish. Improvement of flame retardance of rigid foams is disclosed in U.S. patent specification no. 3574644, U.K. patent specification no. 1404822 and Chemical Abstract Vol 85 no. 16 page 36 no. 109453f. The improvement of flame retardance of flexible foams is disclosed in European patent application no. 0051347A. An object of this invention is to make flexible polyetherurethane foams behave more like rigid foams when subjected to flame and thus produce a protective char with little or no burning melt or drips. This is achieved by including a particular type of graphite in the foam forming reaction mixture. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the production of a flexible flame retardant polyurethane foam from a foam forming reaction mixture including a polymeric polyol and an organic polyisocyanate characterized in that the polymeric polyol is a polyether polyol and the foam forming reaction mixture also contains, as flame retardance conferring additive, expandable graphite as hereinafter defined. According to a further aspect of the present invention a flexible flame retardant polyetherurethane foam comprises the reaction product of a polyether polyol and an organic polyisocyanate characterized in that the foam contains, as flame retardant ingredient, expandable graphite as hereinafter defined. The conditions needed to produce a flexible foam will vary according to the reactants selected. A person of ordinary skill in the art will know whether to include additives, e.g. a catalyst or a blowing agent, and what reaction conditions are required. The molecular weights of the polymeric polyols used in flexible foam manufacture are usually from 1000 to 10,000, preferably from 3000 to 7000, with a functionality of up to 4, preferably 2 to 3. The functionality of the polyisocyanate is usually at least 2. By expandable graphite is meant graphite containing one or more exfoliating agents such that considerable expansion will occur at high temperatures. The foam forming reaction mixture usually contains graphite in an amount such that there will be at least 10 by weight, preferably at least 15 by weight or at least 25 by weight of graphite in the final foam. The amount of graphite required will depend upon the degree of flame retardance required of the foam but usually the amount of graphite will not exceed 30 by weight in the final foam. The graphite may constitute the sole flame retardant additive in the foam forming reaction mixture. Alternatively, other flame retardant ingredients, known If desired, intumescent generating ingredients, e.g. ammonium polyphosphates, may be included in the foam forming reaction mixture. Usually the foams produced according to the present invention will pass the burning test described in the British Standards Specification No. 4735 September 1974. Usually the foams of the present invention are sufficiently flame retardant that if used with selected textile cover materials the resulting combinations would pass the No. 4 crib test of the British Standards Specification No. 5852 Part 2 1982, preferably the No 5 crib test, more preferably the No. 6 crib test and advantageously the No. 7 crib test. In view of the varying degree of flammability of different textile materials it is impossible to give absolute directions as to which textile materials are to be selected. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art would know which materials are likely to be suitable and simple trial and error would then establish whether they were indeed suitable. In order to prepare a foam capable of passing the No. 7 crib test it would generally be necessary for the amount of expandable graphite in the foam to be at least 25 by weight. The present invention will be illustrated by way of the following Examples using the 3 main types of flexible polyurethane foams. Free rise, low resilience polyurethane foams were made from the formulations shown in TABLE A. Samples of each of the above foams were subjected to the burning tests described in British Standards Specification No 4735 and the results were as follows Conventional polyurethane foams were made by moulding the formulations shown in TABLE B below followed by curing for 14 minutes at 150 C. Samples of each of the above foams were tested according to the various crib tests described in British Standards Specification No. 5852, Part 2, the weights of the wooden cribs being as follows High resilience foams were made by moulding the formulations shown in TABLES C and D below in a mould at 50 C, followed by curing for 10 minutes at room temperature. Quantities are parts by weight . A sample of this foam was tested using a A sample of this foam was also tested using a High resilience foams were made by including formulations as shown in Table E in a mould at 45 C followed by curing for 10 minutes at room temperature. For Example 9, foam was tested in combination with a woollen fabric of weight approximately 400g m² using a No. 6 wooden crib weight 60g according to BS 5852 Part 2, 1982. Flaming of the foam fabric combination ceased 11.5 minutes from the ignition of the wooden crib and there was no progressive smouldering revealed by examination one hour after ignition. The weight loss shown by the foam component was about 3 .
