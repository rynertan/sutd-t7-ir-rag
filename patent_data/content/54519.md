All the operations required for the calibration are performed from the outside of the athermic chamber.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Total thermal masking both of the equipment and single tools during calibration operations. 2 Possibility to perform all operations required during the calibration from the outside of the athermic chamber in order to avoid variations of temperature to the whole system. 3 Turnable plate used to accomodate the gauge blocks and as their thermal equalizer. 4 Pneumatic aspiration system for gauge blocks with a nominal length up to 100 mm. modification made to the systems available on the market which were satisfactory only for blocks with a max nominal length of 6 mm. . 5 General calibration system.

## Description
ATHERMIC CHAMBER FOR GEOMETRIC MEASURE TOOLS CALIBRATIONThe subject invention consists of a little chamber, realized in athermic and transparent material, inside which are carriedout calibrations of tools used for geometric measuring.According to the current norms, all checkings and calibrations must be made with ambient temperatures that reach as much as possible 20.00 C and having a related humidity not exceeding 55 .Said calibrations need furtherly to be done in comparison with first line Primary sample tools that have already been calibrated by a well known international Metrology Institute inItaly operates the Metrology Institute G. Colonnetti of Turin .In the execution of such operations this specific case concerns parallel plain steel blocks commonly called JOHANSSON by the inventor name it is necessary to consider some factors that share in the calibrations realiability. Among these good condition first line samples, tools of good reliability, operator s fitness etc. the most interesting factor is the temperature.Are available on the market equipments provided with partial thermal maskings in order to avoid errors due to temperature but they do not totally satisfy.The same body temperature of the operator or operator s hand, or temperature variations that may occur in the measuring spot, are the origin of non reliable calibrations. The so called satisfactory condition would be, to have during the checking or calibration, both the sample tool and the one to be examined at the same temperature.The invention introduced allows to reach such condition.Inside the chamber as shown on table 1 axometric view are located 1 the equipment used for the calibrations 2 a turnable thermic equalizer plate realized in light alloy whose diameter is about 400 inn., with its thickness of about 20 mm. on whose upper surface were obtained seats in which the gauge blocks to be examined are placed.Through the access door 1 opened by the handle 2 on the mentioned plate are located, one beside the other, the sample block and the one to be calibrated complete series .After the whole series of gauge blocks has been positioned the door 1 is closed.Starting from this point all operations necessary, during the calibration of the gauge blocks, are performed from the outside of the chamber.All operations are made by a a pneumatic aspirator made up of 18 8 11 12 b using the athermic gloves c changing the control handles 19 of the equipment.The panel 14 is activated to lock and release the access door 1 which slides on vertical guides.The hole 5 at hermetic seal allows the passage of the thermocouples wires used to check the chamber inner temperature in different points.The rubber canoe 6 allows the pneumatic system tube 8 movement, axial and angular.All the holes made in the chamber wall are necessary for the passage of the various control organs, the seals are assured by rubber gaskets filled with solid vaseline so to avoid air flows.The pneumatic aspirator 18 8 11 12 is made up of a handle ill where it is connected a rigid tube 8 through which flows decompressed air outcoming the mains system 12 . Thins tube, at the end of which is connected an interchangeable air sucker 18 , can move in an axial, angular direction, and rotate aroung its own longitudinal axis.On the same tube, near the sucker 18 it is located an adjustable balance weight 3 , over which it is fitted a pin 9 that allows the operator to rotate the plate so that the gauge blocks may be taken and put for the exam.At the moment the operator wishes to take the gauge block with the air sucker, he will activate a pedal controlled valve which allows depressed air flow from the mains system to the sucker itself.To facilitate such operation, at the same moment the operator activates the valve, the electronic sensors of the control equipment arise to let the gauge blocks be positioned for the exam.After calibration of every single block, the sample gauge is repositioned in the plate and the one examined in the apposite container 17 .Following the complete calibration of the whole series of maximum 121 gauge blocks, the access door 1 is reopened, the container with the calibrated blocks is taken out, and once the protective operations have been made they are put back in the apposite cases. Operating with the system described above which was tested and approved by technicians of Primary Metrological Institutes bothItalians and foreigners for specific calibrations such as those concerning gauge blocks with nominal dimensions betwwen 0.5 mm.and 100 mm. included, we are able to reach very accurate figures that bave never been possible before with nominal mechanic systems now available.
