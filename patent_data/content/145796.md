## Description
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WITH LARGE FUEL TOLERANCEThe invention relates to a reciprocating internal combustion engine having the capability to operate with a wide variety of fuels, using one fuel at a time.The existing solutions for achieving fuel tolerance of internal combustion engines so that the engine can operate with one fuel at a time, use fuel injection during combustion and a compression ratio which favors self ignition of the fuel air mixture.The start of combustion, which is critical for a fuel tolerant engine, is achieved by several methods like spark assistance, ignition on hot surface, the control of air parameters at the beginning of fuel injection, or ignition on a catalytic mesh.Better results have been obtained with spark assisted engines.In these engines, the entire fuel charge is injected either into an open combustion chamber, or into a separate combustion chamber, and the fuel air mixture is spark ignited. Most of these engines use a nozzle located close to a spark plug, and so oriented that part of the fuel plume flows between the spark plug electrodes. Some variants of these engines use fuel vaporization on the combustion chamber wall prior to spark ignition.The spark assisted engines achieve a certain fuel tolerance, especially insensitivity to fuel knock resistance. However, these engines have significant weaknesses, most of them resulting from I the spark release in a heterogeneous mixture, which is not favorable for spark ignition 2 the small ignition zone ensured by a spark plug 3 the design constraints adopted for lowering the engine sensitivity to some fuel characteristics.Usually the spark assisted engines are highly sensitive to fuel volatility and to injection rate, need fuels having certain self ignition ability, and have very high hydrocarbon emission at low loads. The variants with fuel vaporization on combustion chambers wall are less sensitive to fuel volatility, but need fuels having certain knock resistance, and their operation worsens at low loads.The object of the invention as claimed is a spark assisted diesel engine having the ability to operate with a large variety of fuels, using one fuel at a time. This capability, as well as other advantages, are achieved by special configurations of the engine, associated with new methods of operation.Each cylinder of the engine is provided with an open combustion chamber, and a separate combustion chamber. These combustion chambers are connected by a channel. Each combustion chamber is provided with a nozzle, connected to its own injection system, which delivers at selected moments a metered amount of fuel into the respective combustion chamber. The separate combustion chamber is also provided with a spark plug connected to a spark ignition system. The channel which connects the two combustion chambers is controlled by a valve, called further control valve.This valve is actuated by means which ensure valve opening and closing at selected moments of the working cycle. During combustion, the control valve can operate as a pressure relief valve, or as a regular poppet valve actuated by its means. In the former case the control valve opens when the gas pressure in separate combustion chamber is higher than the gas pressure in open combustion chamber.The fuel is injected first into separate chamber. This injection starts in a selected moment situated between late exhaust stroke and early intake stroke. The control valve is opened in a selected moment situated before, during, or after fuel injection into separate chamber. This valve is closed in a selected moment of the compression stroke further, the compression process continues only in engine cylinder. When combustion shall start the fuel air mixture of the separate chamber is spark ignited. Due to combustion progression, the gas pressure in this chamber increases. When the pressure reaches a certain value, the control valve opens like a pressure relief valve, and burning gases are ejected from separate chamber into open chamber. The fuel charge of the open chamber is injected into incoming burning gases, which ensures a fast ignition and smooth combustion in this chamber. When the gas pressure in open chamber becomes higher than the gas pressure in separate chamber, the control valve is closed. This valve is opened again like a pressure relief valve during expansion stroke, when the gas pressure in open chamber has correspondingly decreased as a result, hot gases from separate chamber are ejected again into open chamber.When the pressure difference between the two combustion chambers cannot hold the valve open against valve spring, the control valve closes. Further, the gas expansion and the gas exchange process occur as usual, according to engine type. As an alternative, the control valve can be opened before or after spark release in separate chamber, like an usual poppet valve.The manner in which the invention is carried into practice, the methods of operation, and further objects and advantages of the invention are set forth in the following specification, wherein the invention is described in further detail by reference to the accompanying drawing.Figure 1 shows in a schematic way the main components of one cylinder of the internal combustion engine with large fuel tolerance, according to the invention.The engine can be either of four stroke or of two stroke type.It is a spark assisted diesel engine provided with an open combustion chamber 3, delimited by cylinder 1, piston 2, and cylinder head 12 as an example, in Fig. 1 the open chamber is located in piston 2. A separate combustion chamber 6, located in cylinder head or in another convenient place, is connected with the open combustion chamber 3 via channel 4, controlled by valve 11. This valve is actuated by means which open or close the valve at selected moments of the working cycle eventually the means have the capability to modify the valve timing. These means can be of any type they are not represented in Fig. 1.Valve 11 can also operate as a pressure relief valve, being opened when the gas pressure in separate combustion chamber 6 is higher than the gas pressure in open combustion chamber 3 to attenuate the shocks which occur in this mode of operation at the opening and closing of the valve, corresponding means are used.The valve lift is limited to a distance slightly larger than that ensured by the means which actuate the valve.The separate combustion chamber 6 is provided with the spark plug 5, connected to a spark ignition system, which is not represented in Fig. 1. A part of the fuel charge of the cycle is delivered into separate combustion chamber 6 by nozzle 8, connected to injection pump 7 via line 9. Another nozzle 13, connected to injection pump 16 via line 15, delivers the remaining part of the fuel charge of the cycle into open combustion chamber 3. Lines 9 and 15 are provided with heaters 10 and 14, respectively. The pumps 7 and 16 are connected to the fuel tank 17. The other usual components of the engine are not shown in Fig. 1. The engine operates as follows. In a selected moment situated between late expansion stroke and early intake stroke, nozzle 8 starts to deliver a metered amount of fuel into separate combustion chamber 6. Since the fuel injection is achieved when this chamber is filled with residual combustion gases, a fast fuel vaporization occurs, whatever the fuel characteristics are at the same time no significant chemical reactions occur in this chamber, because of low oxygen content of residual combustion gases of chamber 6. To activate the fuel vaporization, the fuel can be heated by the heater 10. Valve 11 is opened before, during, or after fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6. Various correlations between the timing of valve 11 and the timing of fuel injection into separate chamber 6 are analyzed later in this description.During compression stroke a part of the gas charge of cylinder 1 flows into separate combustion chamber 6. The incoming gas, which is mostly air, mixes with the fuel and the residual combustion gases of this chamber. A homogeneous mixture is achieved because of turbulent flow, and since the fuel previously injected into separate combustion chamber 6 is already vaporized.Valve 11 is closed when the parameters of this mixture are high enough for ensuring a combustion pressure in the separate chamber 6 higher than the compression pressure in the open chamber 3, but low enough for preventing uncontrolled combustion in chamber 6.Further, the compression process continues only in engine cylinder.When combustion shall start, the fuel air mixture of separate chamber 6 is spark ignited. A combustion of flame propagation type occurs, since this mixture is homogeneous. As the combustion proceeds, the gas pressure in chamber 6 increases.When this pressure becomes higher than the gas pressure in open chamber 3, valve 11 opens like a pressure relief valve, and burning gases are ejected into open chamber 3. The fuel charge of open combustion chamber 3 is injected into incoming burning gases. Due to high temperature and high concentration of reactive particles of these gases, a fast ignition and smooth combustion occur, whatever the fuel characteristics may be. To improve the fuel atomization and vaporization, the fuel can be heated by heater 14, prior to its injection.The combustion progression in open chamber 3 increases the gas pressure in this chamber. Therefore the force which holds the valve 11 open decreases. When this force becomes smaller than the force of valve spring, the valve is closed. Further, combustion in open chamber 3 develops like in a direct injection diesel engine, but in a much better environment, as a result of the initial strong support brought by the burning gases ejected from separate chamber 6.During the expansion stroke valve 11 opens again, when the pressure in cylinder 1 has correspondingly decreased. As a result hot combustion gases are discharged from separate chamber 6 into open chamber 3. This process ends when the pressure difference between chambers 6 and 3 cannot maintain valve 11 open against valve spring. Further, gas expansion and gas exchange process occur as usual according to engine type.The closing of valve 11 during compression stroke acts as a sudden increase of compression ratio in cylinder 11, which increases the compression pressure as compared with that of the engine without valve 11. The higher the ratio between the volume of separate combustion chamber 6 and the volume of open combustion chamber 3, the higher the compression pressure. The same effect has an earlier closing of valve 11 during compression stroke. The last circumstance can be used for ensuring an easy cold start of the engine. However, in normal operation the compression pressure in open chamber 3 may be too high. A convenient compression pressure can be achieved by decreasing the nominal compression ratio, or and the ratio between the volume of separate combustion chamber 6 and the volume of open combustion chamber 3.An important effect on engine operation has the opening timing of valve 11, and the timing of fuel injection into separate chamber 6. The opening timing of valve 11 determines whether or not additional combustion gases are recirculated, and whether or not a part of the fuel injected into separate combustion chamber 6 is transferred into open combustion chamber 3. The timing of fuel injection into separate chamber 6 determines the fuel residence time in this chamber, therefore the degree of fuel vaporization.Several methods of engine operation, resulting from various combinations of the above mentioned parameters, are possible. Among these methods, which form a part of the present invention, some are further described in more details, as examples illustrating the implications on engine operation.1. The opening of valve 11 starts in a selected moment situated between late expansion stroke and late exhaust stroke, and fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 starts in a selected moment situated between early intake stroke and early compression stroke. This method of engine operation allows the final discharge of separate combustion chamber 6 in a part of the cycle when the eventual unburned components of this chamber can burn in engine cylinder or in the exhaust manifold. The method prevents a significant fuel transfer from separate chamber 6 into open chamber 3, as well as the recirculation of additional combustion gases.2. The opening of valve 11 starts in a selected moment situated between early intake stroke and early compression stroke, and fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 occurs after the opening of valve 11. This method of engine operation recirculates all eventual unburned components of separate combustion chamber 6. It recirculates in engine cylinder the combustion gases discharged from separate chamber, but prevents a significant fuel transfer between the two chambers, and avoids an early air penetration into separate chamber which can occur when the engine is supercharged and valve 11 is opened during exhaust stroke or earlier.3. Fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 starts in a selected moment situated between late expansion stroke and early exhaust stroke, and the opening of valve 11 starts in a selected moment of the exhaust stroke, after the end of fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6. This method of engine operation achieves a fuel transfer from separate chamber into exhaust manifold, which can be useful for the cleaning of particulate trap oxidizer. 4. Fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 starts in a selected moment situated between late expansion stroke and early compression stroke, and the opening of valve 11 starts in a selected moment after the end of fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6. This method of engine operation recirculates all eventual unburned components of separate chamber. It recirculates in engine cylinder the combustion gases discharged from separate chamber. A part of the fuel charge of separate chamber is transferred into open chamber with the discharged gases, which can help combustion in some operating regimes.5. Valve 11 is opened by the means for valve actuation, in a selected moment of compression stroke before spark release in separate combustion chamber 6. This valve is closed in a selected moment during exhaust stroke. The fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 starts in a selected moment situated between the closing of valve 11 and early compression stroke.This method of engine operation avoids a relatively long contact between fuel and air. Combustion in separate chamber 6 occurs at higher pressure than in previous methods of engine operation this circumstance increases the duration of the ejection of burning gases into open chamber 3, which favors combustion in this chamber. However, the available time for the fuel air mixing into separate combustion chamber 6 is shorter. This method of engine operation allows gas exchange in both senses between the combustion chambers, which increases noise and flow losses, eliminates the second discharge of hot gases into open combustion chamber 3, and increases the oxygen content of the residual combustion gases of separate chamber 6, particularly at low engine load. 6. Valve 11 is permanently open, fuel injection into separate combustion chamber 6 starts in a selected moment between early intake stroke and early compression stroke, and spark timing is delayed towards late compression stroke. This method of engine operation ensures an easy cold start, since compression in separate chamber is not limited, and therefore the temperature and pressure in this chamber at the time of spark release are much higher than in normal operation of the engine consequently, an ignitable fuel air mixture is achieved even in a cold engine.7. Valve 11 is closed at a selected moment of early compression stroke, and no fuel is injected into separate combustion chamber 6. In these conditions the engine operates like a regular direct injection diesel engine, but at substantially higher compression ratio. Therefore this method of engine operation also achieves an easy cold start of the engine.To take advantage of the methods of engine operation, the means which actuate valve 11 shall have the capability to modify the valve timing. The most advantageous is an independent variation of the opening timing and the closing timing. These means shall also have the possibility to maintain the valve permanently open if the cold start of the engine is achieved according to method 6 of engine operation, described above.The injection system of separate combustion chamber shall have the possibility to variate the injection timing in a broad range.Because the fuel injection into separate combustion chamber mostly occurs when the gas pressure in this chamber is low, a system of the type for gasoline injection in conventional spark ignition engines can be used, since this type achieves a large variation of injection timing. Additionally, this injection system is easy electronically programmable.The internal combustion engine, according to the invention, has significant advantages as compared with the existing fuel tolerant engines operating with one fuel at a time. The injection of the fuel charge of separate chamber into combustion gases and relatively long time before spark release ensures a complete fuel vaporization, whatever the fuel fuel volatility and viscosity are. The equivalence ratio of the fuel air mixture can differ between the two combustion chambers this circumstance allows the use in separate combustion chamber that mixture which is more convenient for spark ignition. The limitation of compression in open chamber avoids uncontrolled combustion in this chamber. Before spark release the separate combustion chamber contains a homogeneous fuel air mixture, which ensures a reliable spark ignition and favorable combustion development. The burning gases ejected from the separate chamber achieves ignition and smooth combustion in open chamber, whatever the fuel characteristics may be. The second discharge of hot gases into open chamber improves the last part of combustion in this chamber, and intensifies the burning of particulates generated during combustion process. The gas flow from open chamber into separate chamber is avoided during combustion, which reduces noise and flow losses. The engine has an easy cold start, and a normal operation at relatively low compression ratio.The foregoing description of the invention has been referred to certain configurations and methods of engine operation, it being understood that many other configurations and methods of engine operation are possible within the spirit and the scope of the invention.
