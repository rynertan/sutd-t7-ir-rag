# INJECTION STRETCH BLOW MOLDED CONTAINER AND RESIN COMPOSITION THEREFOR

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are containers, each of which is equipped with a side wall having a percentage haze of 9 or smaller when converted to the wall thickness of 1 mm and has been obtained by injection stretch blow molding a resin composition of a polypropyrene base resin, preferably of a random copolymer of propylene and an alpha olefin. Resin compositions and improved injection stretch blow molding processes, which are both suited for the production of such containers, are also disclosed. Also disclosed are therapeutic containers obtained by subjecting a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene, which copolymer has a specific melt flow index, to injection stretch blow molding.
