## Description
The present invention relates to a delay circuit applied to, for example, a gate array large scale integrated circuit LSI . In a gate array LSI, a delay circuit is used for delaying the propagation of a signal for a definite time period. Such a delay circuit must offer an optimum delay time period, a small mounting area, and minimum fluctuation of the delay time period. In general, a delay time period t There is a prior art delay circuit of a gate array LSI comprised of a series of inverters of MIS transistors having a definite size. However, when a series of such inverters are simply connected to obtain a delay time period, the larger the delay time period, the greater the number of transistors, and thus the larger the area occupied. Note that it is also possible to construct a delay circuit by using a resistance capacitance RC circuit. In this case, the delay time period must be adjusted by the resistance of polycrystalline silicon or the resistance of a diffusion region. However, such an adjustment is also impossible in a gate array LSI. Accordingly, it is impossible to use an RC circuit as a delay circuit for a gate array LSI. An article by R.H. Krambeck et al in IEEE journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol SC 17, No. 3, June 1982 entitled High Speed Compact Circuits with CMOS discloses a pseudo NMOS circuit having a plurality of FET s connected in series as part of an 8 bit ALU critical path. According to the present invention, there is provided a delay circuit comprising An embodiment of the present invention can provide a delay circuit, suitable for a gate array LSI, having a small area. In the present invention, two inverters having series connected P channel N channel transistors, in which the outputs of the post stage inverter are fed back to some of the inputs of the pre stage inverters, are provided. In this case, since the outputs of the post stage inverter are fed back to the pre stage inverter, the driving ability thereof is reduced, thereby increasing the delay time period. Also, a large fan out is obtained. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, wherein In Fig. 1, which is a partial circuit diagram of a gate array LSI, it is assumed that a clock signal CK₀ is delayed by time periods t₁ and t₂ to generate clock signals CK₁ and CK₂ , as shown in Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2D, thereby latching flip flops FF1 and FF2. In this case, after the flip flop FF1 is latched by the clock signal CK₁ as shown in Fig. 2C, if the delay time period t₂ of the clock signal CK₂ is large, a latch operation for the flip flop FF2 by the clock signal CK₂ may be performed upon the next data. This means that the hold time period of the input data of the flip flop FF2 by the clock signal CK₂ may be reduced. In order to secure a sufficient hold time period, a delay circuit DL is interposed between the flip flops FF₁ and FF₂ , as illustrated in Fig. 3. As a result, the data output Q of the flip flop FF1 is delayed by a time period t Figure 5 shows a prior art delay circuit used in a gate array LSI. A series of inverters INV are provided. Each of the inverters INV is constructed by a basic cell, which consists, for example, of four two input gates. An example of a basic cell will now be explained with reference to Figs. 6, 7, 8, and 9. Figure 6 is an equivalent circuit diagram of a complementary MIS CMIS basic cell. The basic cell is comprised of a pair of P channel transistors Q Returning to Fig. 5, as stated above, each inverter INV is constructed by a basic cell as shown in Figs. 6 through 9. In this case, each inverter INV uses only two gates, e.g., the transistors Q In order to obtain a large delay time period, the delay circuit of Fig. 5 requires a large number of inverters stages, i.e., basic cells, occupying a large area. In Fig. 10, P channel transistors Q When the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low, the P channel transistors Q On the other hand, when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high, the N channel transistors Q Thus, since the P channel transistors or the N channel transistors are sequentially turned on from the outside to the inside, and the N channel transistors or the P channel transistors are turned on, the change of the potential at the output terminal OUT is delayed. Note that the fluctuation in the operation of the circuit of Fig. 10 is about the same as in conventional logic circuits. In Fig. 12, two inverter circuits as shown in Fig. 10 are provided. That is, an inverter INVA is comprised of P channel transistors Q In Fig. 12, the potential at the input terminal IN is applied to the gates of the transistors Q Note that, if the circuit of Fig. 12 is constructed by basic cells each having four two input gates, as shown in Figs. 6 through 9, the transistors Q The operation of the circuit of Fig. 12 is shown in Figs. 13 through 16. Figure 13 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 0 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high Fig. 14 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 0 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low Fig. 15 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 5 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high and Fig. 16 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 5 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low. Referring to Fig. 13, first, if the potential at the input terminal IN is low, the P channel transistors Q Next, when the potential at the input germinal IN becomes a sufficiently high level, the transistors Q Thus, the potential at the output terminal OUT is changed by the charging and discharging operation of the transistors Q In addition, when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low, the potential at each node is changed as shown in Fig. 14. A detailed explanation is omitted, since it is similar to that of Fig. 13, however, in this case, the potential at the output terminal OUT is changed by the discharging operation of the transistors Q Note that, in the case wherein the fan out is 5, Fig. 13 is replaced by Fig. 15, and Fig. 14 is replaced by Fig. 16. That is, the waveform at the output terminal OUT is blunt and the delay time period is further increased. In any case, a delay time period having a time larger than 5 ns can be obtained, and therefore, is larger than that of the circuit of Fig. 5. Note that, in the above mentioned embodiments of Figs. 10 and 12, each of the inverters has the same number of P channel transistors and N channel transistors connected in series. Any number can be, of course, selected, however. In Fig. 17, two inverters INVA and INVB are added to the circuit of Fig. 12. That is, the inverter INVA is interposed between the inverters INVA and INVB, and the inverter INVB is connected to the output of the inverter INVB. The inverters INVA and INVB serve as wave shaping means. Each of them may be constructed by two gates of one basic cell, for example as shown in Figs. 6 through 9. In Fig. 18, which illustrates an embodiment of the present invention, two inverters INVA and INVB are provided. In the inverter INVA, each pair of P channel N channel transistors Q That is, in Fig. 18, the inverter INV₁ Q Thus, the output of each inverter of the post stage inverter INVB is fed back to the input of each inverter of the pre stage inverter INVA. Accordingly, the driving power of each inverter INV₁ to INV₈ is reduced, thereby increasing the delay time period. Note that, if the circuit of Fig. 18 is constructed by basic cells each having four two input gates as shown in Figs. 6 through 9, the circuit of Fig. 18 can be constructed by four basic cells in the same way as in the circuit of Fig. 12. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 18 is shown in Figs. 21 through 24. Figures 21 through 24 correspond to Figs. 13 through 16, respectively. That is, Fig. 21 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 0 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high Fig. 22 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 0 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low Fig. 23 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 5 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high and Fig. 24 shows the case wherein the fan out F O is 5 and wherein the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low. Referring to Fig. 21, it is assumed that the potentials at the input terminal IN, the outputs B, D, F, and the output terminal OUT are low, and the potentials at the outputs A, C, E, and G are high. At this time, when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high, the transistor Q Contrary to the above, in a state where the potentials at the input terminal IN, the outputs B, D, F, and the output terminal OUT are high and the potentials at the outputs A, C, E, and G are low, when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low, the potential at each node is changed as shown in Fig. 22. A detailed explanation thereof is omitted, since it is similar to that of Fig. 21. Thus, since saddle points are generated in the change of the potentials at the outputs C, E, and G and at the outputs B, D, and F, the delay time period is increased. Note that, in the case wherein the fan out is 5, Fig. 21 is replaced by Fig. 23 and Fig. 22 is replaced by Fig. 24. That is, the waveform at the output terminal OUT is blunt and the delay time period is further increased. In any case, a delay time period having a time larger than 5 ns can be obtained and therefore, is larger than that of Fig. 5. In Fig. 25, which illustrates another embodiment of the present invention similar to the embodiment as shown in Fig. 18, the inverters INV₃ Q Thus, in Figs. 18 and 25, since the driving power of each inverter included in the inverters INVA and INVB is reduced by feedback control thereof, the delay time period is increased as compared with the circuit of Fig. 12. In Fig. 26, which illustrates a further embodiment of the present invention similar to the embodiment of Fig. 25, the inverters INV₃ Q The operation of the circuit of Fig. 26 will be explained with reference to Figs. 27 and 28. In Fig. 27, in an initial state, the potentials at the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT are low. At this time, since the transistors Q Thus, although the potential at the node A rapidly ends its fall, there is generated a temporary saddle point in the potential at the node B, thereby increasing the delay time period. In Fig. 28, in an initial state, the potentials at the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT are high. At this time, since the transistors Q Thus, although the potential at the node A rapidly ends its rise, there is generated a temporary saddle point in the potential at the node B, thereby increasing the delay time period. Note that the reason why the delay time period in Fig. 27 is larger than that in Fig. 28 is that the driving power for P channel transistors is smaller than that for N channel transistors. Thus, when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from low to high, the delay time period is larger than 17 ns, while when the potential at the input terminal IN is changed from high to low, the delay time is larger than 7 ns. In any case, a delay time period having a time larger than 5 ns can be obtained and therefore, is larger than that of Fig. 5. Figures 27 and 28 show the case where the fan out is 0. However, if the fan out is larger than 1, the delay time period is further increased. As explained hereinbefore, according to the present invention, the delay time period can be increased as compared with the prior art where a plurality of inverters are simply connected in series. In other words, with the same delay time period, it is possible to reduce the area occupied by the delay circuit.
