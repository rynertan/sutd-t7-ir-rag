## Description
RACK ASSEMBLY FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESSORS The present invention relates to rack assemblies for photographic processors. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel rack for roller processors of the type having a large number of pairs of rollers that are driven simultaneously for feeding photographic material from one pair of rollers to the next through the roller processor. Photographic materials such as paper and film are developed in processors after being exposed. Photographic paper and film may be in a continuous roll form or may be cut to individual picture size. Leader processors employ a leader strip attached to the paper or film which has been connected together to provide a continuous strip form before being processed in a leader processor.Roller processors do not require a leader strip because the photographic material being processed is controlled from one pair of rollers to the next through the processor which enables very small pieces of photographic material to be conducted through the processor. When pairs of rollers in roller processors are spaced close enough together to maintain control of the piece of photographic material being processed, a very large number of rollers are required as determined by the length of the photographic path through the processor and the speed of the material as it passes through the processor. It is not uncommon to employ as many as three hundred rollers in a roller transport rack of a roller processor. A processor may have up to sixteen such racks in large processors. A large amount of time is required to manually assemble the large number of rollers required in the individual racks of roller processors. Heretofore, the rollers being inserted in roller processors were preferably made with stub shafts extending from the ends of the roller or a complete rod or shaft extending through the roller. Some roller processor rack assemblies were made by assembling the rollers into one of the side frames, then the other side frame was added which required that the rollers be axially aligned with holes or bearing apertures in the last side frame being assembled. Needless to say, it is difficult to align the bearing apertures in the last to be assembled side frame with the pins or stub shafts of a large number of rollers at the same time. Heretofore, rollers to be assembled in roller processor rack assemblies were made with the shaft or stub shafts having a short extension at one end and a long extension at the other end. This enabled the two side frames to be made into a rigid frame employing spacer rods before the rollers are assembled one at a time between the side frames. This method of assembly is not desirable because the roller on the shafts must be shorter than the space between the side frames to enable the long shaft of the roller to be assembled in its bearing aperture first and leave enough clearance when the shoulder of the roller is against the side frame to enable the short pin or shaft to be aligned with its aperture before being inserted therein.Not only does this method of assembly cause the roller on the shafts to be shorter than it is desirable but the roller can not be aligned orthogonally with the first side frame and its aperture and must be inserted at an angle which requires that the bearings be made oversize in order to receive the pin fixed in the rollers. In the prior art roller rack assemblies the short pin was the stub shaft and served only as a bearing pin whereas the long pin was usually a gear pin and had a gear inserted thereon after the pin had been inserted through an aperture in the side frame. By inserting the long pin first and shortening the length of the roller on the shaft the individual rollers could be inserted into a rigid frame by tilting the roller sideways. The oversize aperture at the gear pin was supplied with a self aligning or flexible universal bearing to take up the slack or clearance which was present when the oversize aperture was provided. When the side frames of a roller rack assembly are made from strong metal sheets it was necessary to make the apertures for the pins or stub shafts extended from the rollers oversize in order to accommodate an insertable anti friction bearing there through.If the sheet metal of the side frame was used as a bearing surface in engagement with the stub shaft or pins the metal to metal contact would cause excessive wear of the pins or the side frames. It has been suggested that the side frames of roller rack assemblies could be made from a high density, self lubricating plastic sheet. However, when the prior art type rollers with pin shafts and stub shafts extending therefrom were assembled into the plastic sheet side frames, the hole or bearing aperture which receives the long pin had to be oversize in order to accommodate the angular direction from which the roller is assembled, thus, defeating the purpose of having plastic side frames. It would be desirable to employ high density plastic sheets as side frames of roller rack assemblies for roller processors without having to foreshorten the roller and provide oversize apertures for the gear pin in order to facilitate assembly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a novel rack assembly for a roller processor. It is another principal object of the present invention to provide a rack assembly for a roller processor comprising spacers and plastic side frames having pin or shaft apertures in the side frames which support one end of the rollers thereon. It is another principal object of the present invention to provide a rack assembly for a roller processor comprising spacers interconnecting plastic side frames and having roller bearing apertures in the side frames larger than the rollers, thus, permitting insertion and removal of the rollers from the outside of the side frames. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel rack assembly having high density, friction resistant plastic side frames and further having steel reinforcing inner frames. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel side frame that facilitates and simplifies the manufacturer of the rack assemblies for roller processors. According to these and other objects of the present invention there is provided a novel rack assembly which comprises two side frames interconnected with spacer rods to provide a rigid frame. A plurality of roller bearing pin apertures are provided in the side frames and axially aligned with these roller bearing pin apertures is a roller bearing aperture in the opposite side frame. The rollers of the rack assembly are inserted through the roller bearing apertures from the outside of the rigid frame and the bearing pin on the roller is inserted through the bearing pin aperture from the inside of the side frames.Fastening means are provided on the bearing pins to prevent axial movement of the rollers once they are installed in the side frames.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figure 1 shows an end view of a rack frame of the type employed in the present invention. The incomplete rack assembly 10 shown in Figure 1 comprises two side frames 11 each having a plurality of roller bearing apertures 12 large enough to accept a roller therethrough. The side frame 11 also is provided with a plurality of roller bearing pin apertures 12 which are adapted to receive roller bearing pins not shown in Figure 1 . Axially aligned with the roller bearing apertures 12 there will be a pair of roller bearing pin apertures in the opposite side frame. Similarly axially aligned with the roller bearing pin apertures 13 shown in side frame 11, there will be a pair of roller bearing apertures in the opposite side frame. Figure 2 is an end view of the rack assembly of the type shown in Figure 1 showing drive gears employed for simultaneously driving the rollers. Power gear 15 mounted on power shaft 16 which extends completely through the two side frames, engages driven gear 17 rotatably mounted on stub shaft 18. Gear 17 engages drive gear 19 which is connected to driving gear 21 both of which are rotatably mounted on stub shaft 22. Driven gear 21 drives drive gear 23 which is rotatably mounted on stub shaft 24. Drive gear 23 in turn drives the plurality of gears 25 which comprise the drive means connected to a gear drive pin 26 connected to one of the rollers.As will be explained in detail hereinafter, each of the gears 25 and gear drive pins 26 have a smaller gear not shown in Figure 2 which engages a similar gear so that each pair of rollers are driven simultaneously and at the same speed by one of the gears 25. The power gear 15 is mounted on shaft 16 which extends through the opposite side frame and has a gear similar to gear 15 mounted thereon for driving a drive train similar to that shown in Figure 2. Refer now to Figure 3 which is an isometric view of the rack assembly frame shown in Figures 1 and 2. Left side frame 11 is shown connected to right side frame 31 by means of spacer rods or spacer bars 32 forming a rigid frame therewith. Self tapping screws 33 are preferably employed to fasten rods 32 to the side frames 11 and 31. An axis 34 of one of the rollers is shown extending from the center of roller bearing aperture 12 to the center of roller bearing pin aperture 13 . In similar manner, another axis 35 extends from a similar roller bearing aperture 12 in side frame 11 to a roller bearing pin aperture 13 in side frame 31. The large apertures in side frame 31 are roller bearing apertures and the small apertures on either side of the material path 14 are roller bearing pin apertures.A pair of apertures 13 in one side frame are axially aligned with a pair of apertures 12 in the other side frame so that rollers supported by the side frames 11 and 31 are perpendicular to the side frames and parallel to each other. In the preferred embodiment rack assembly the majority of the transport rollers are not touching each other and the material to be transported is adapted to engage at least one of the rollers which is being driven at the same speed as the other rollers. At the exit of rack assembly 10 there is shown a pair of rollers 36 of the type employed in the prior art. These rollers are made of resilient material mounted on through shafts 37 and are adapted to engage each other and act as squeegees or stripper rolls as the material is passed from the rack assembly on the path 14 shown in Figure 1.The gears 38 shown on the end of shafts 37 are similar to the gears employed to drive the rollers as will be explained in detail hereinafter. Refer now to Figure 4 showing a pair of prior art type rollers 39 and 41 mounted in side frames 42 and 43. Roller 39 has a short end 44 extending from one end of the roller 39 and a long pin 45 extending from the other end of the roller 39. In the prior art the steel pins 44 and 45 are inserted into the roller proper 39 before being assembled into the side frames. The side frames 42 and 43 were assembled in a substantially rigid form by employing spacer rods of the type shown in Figure 3. Once the two steel side frames 42 and 43 were made into a substantially rigid frame the universal bearings 46 were then inserted in the oversize bearing apertures 47 which permitted the universal bearings 46 to move axially as well as to swivel in their oversized apertures 47.Next the prior art type roller 39 was offset at an angle sufficient to permit the long pin 45 to be inserted through its bearing 46 at an angle to the side frame 43. The shoulder of the roller 39 was abutted against the side frame 43 and bearing 46 so as to permit the short pin 44 to be aligned with its universal bearing 46.When the short pin 44 is inserted through its bearing and fastener means 48 is attached thereto there is a substantial clearance 49 between one end of the roller and the side frame 43. After roller 39 was positioned in bearings 46 between side frames 42 and 43, a thrust washer 51, gears 52, 53 and fastener means 54 were mounted on shaft 45. In order to rotate shaft 45 with gear 53 it was necessary to provide some means for fixing gears 52 and 53 to shaft 45. One method of accomplishing this was to provide a flat on shaft 45 and a D shaped aperture in gears 52 and 53. It was found that this was an expensive method of manufacturing the complete rollers 39 and their drive means and required considerable assembly time. The short pin 44 on roller 41 is identical to the short pin on roller 39. The long pin 55 on roller 41 is not as long as long as pin 45 on roller 39, however, roller 41 was assembled in the same manner requiring that the roller be offset at a substantial angle so that the long pin 55 could be inserted through its universal bearing 46 and then moved axially to the right so that the short pin 44 would clear the side frame at bearing 46 and could be extended therethrough. After the roller 41 had fastener 48 attached thereto the thrust washer 51, gear 52 and fastening means 54 could be mounted on shaft 55. One of the problems which occurred in the prior art roller processors depicted in Figure 4 was that the rollers 39 and 41 were not always parallel to each other. The apertures 47 in side frames 42 and 43 were made loose to permit the insertion of universal bearings 46. Universal bearings 46 in turn had to be oversized to permit clearance of the long pins 45 and 55 when inserted therethrough at a substantial angle. The same clearance was provided at the apertures 47 and bearings 46 at the short pins 44 to provide the same amount of play and presumably the same axial alignment. Refer now to Figure 5 showing a plan view of a pair of the present invention moulded plastic rollers 56 and 57 mounted in side frames 58 and 59. In the preferred embodiment shown rollers 56 and 57 are molded from a hard plastic material which is not affected by the chemicals used in the processor. Roller bearing pins 61 are preferably molded integrally with the rollers 56 and 57. The cylindrical surface 62 bears on the roller bearing pin apertures 13 and the tapered conical head 63 is adapted to snap through the apertures 13 leaving a slightly inclined thrust shoulder 64 extending on the outside of side frame 59.The slot 65 in bearing pin 61 permits the conical head 63 to be reduced in size when the roller 56 is being inserted or removed. Roller 56 is further provided with a gear drive pin 66 which is preferably molded as an integral part of the roller 56. It will be understood that both gear drive pins 66 and bearing pins 61 may be made as separate elements and fastened in recesses in roller 56.However, it has been found that the precise accuracy afforded by molding pins 61 and 66 with roller 56 provides a concentricity which was not available heretofore in the prior art. For example, when long pin 45 was inserted into roller 39 it was possible to have pin 45 inserted into an eccentric recess.Further, the long pins 45 and 55 quite often have a very slight angle of deviation away from the axial center of the rollers. This would cause the roller 39 or 41 to wobble and the distance between rollers 39 and 41 would vary during each revolution. This was in addition to the prior art problem of looseness in the bearings 46. In the present invention it is possible to construct the bearing pins 61 so that they fit snugly into the roller bearing pin aperture 13. In similar manner the roller bearing apertures 12 may be made very snug to accommodate the rollers 56 and 57 because the rollers are inserted axially through the apertures 12 and axially through the apertures 13 without lateral displacement.Thus, there is no need for providing the clearance and slack that was necessary in the prior art roller processors. While the prior art short pins 44 may produce some eccentricity, and did produce deviations due to clearances, the short pins 61 have no such problems. The long pin or gear drive pin on roller 56 has no effect on the true running of roller 56 since the roller 56 itself provides a bearing surface for true running in aperture 12 of side frame 58. The gear 67 may be mounted on pin 66 before roller 56 is inserted in place between the side frames 58 and 59. Plastic gears 67 may be mounted on plastic extension gear drive pin 66 by splines, adhesives and or ultrasonic welding without the requirement for thrust washers and or fastening means. The only fastening means required for the roller 56 is the conical head 63 and shoulder 64.The shoulder 84 on the roller 56 provides means for engaging the friction resistance side frame 59 in one direction and the shoulder 64 provides the thrust retention in the opposite direction, thus eliminating the prior art fastening means. Roller 57 is substantially identical to roller 56 in all respects except the gear drive pin 68. When the forces of the gears 69 and 71 are small, as is usually the case, the long gear drive pin 68 may be integrally molded with the roller 57. However, if the forces are large and the pin is long, it is possible to insert a steel pin 68 into roller 57 without effecting the axial alignment of roller 57 as occurred in the prior art. Refer now to Figure 6 showing a modified roller of the type shown inFigure 5. When the roller 56 is not made from a hard plastic sufficient for long wearing characteristics in the side frame 58, it may be necessary to provide an annular bearing 72 on the end of roller 56 . The annular bearing is preferably made from a material similar to the hard rollers 56 and 57 but may be made from a high density friction resistant plastic similar to the side frames 58 and 59. When the soft roller 56 is not structually strong enough to support itself on a rigid axis a shaft 73 is extended completely through the roller 56 and a spline or flat 74 is provided for mounting the drive gear 75 as explained hereinbefore. The roller 56 may be inserted through the aperture 12 to place it in its proper position between the side frames 57 and 58 as was explained hereinbefore.If the shaft 73 is a steel shaft a fastener must be provided at the opposite end as will be explained hereinafter. Refer now to Figure 7 showing another modified roller of the type shown in Figure 5. A steel shaft or gear pin 76 is shown inserted in roller 77. Roller 77 is sufficiently rigid to support pin 76 but is not of a material which has the best anti friction bearing characteristics. An annular ring 78 of bearing material is mounted directly on roller 77 and engages the roller bearing aperture 12 of side frame 58. Pairs of splines 79 may be provided on pins 76 for mounting gears thereon. Even with gears mounted on pin 76 the roller 77 may be inserted between the side frames 58 and 59 in direct axially alignment with the apertures 12 and 13 as was explained hereinbefore. Refer now to Figure 8 showing a short pin 81 extending from roller 82.When the roller 82 is made from a hard rigid plastic the pin 81 may be molded integrally therewith and the groove 83 added as a machining operation. When the roller 82 is made of soft material, the short pin 81 is an extension of the through shaft of the type shown in Figure 6. When the roller 82 is made of hard plastic its shoulder 84 may provide thrust alignment in one direction, however, if the roller 82 is of soft material a thrust washer must be added to provide the shoulder 84. Also the gears may be provided with a thrust shoulder when mounted on either end of the roller. The pins shown in Figures 5 to 8 may be integrally moulded with the rollers. Refer now to Figure 9 which is a plan view of a thin flexible plastic washer adapted to be snapped over the end of pin 81 to permit the fingers 85 of washer 86 to snap into the grooves 83 and provide fastening means for short pins having recessed annular grooves therein. Other types of fasteners may be employed in the groove 83, however, the plastic washer 86 may be chosen from plastics which provide excellent anti wear characteristics when engaged with side frame 59. Refer now to Figures 10 to 12 showing a steel mounting plate 87 for sup porting stub shafts of the type shown in Figure 3. Stub shafts 18, 22, and 24 as well as shafts 88 and 89 may be inserted through the steel plate 87 and staked or riveted by expanding the head on the opposite side of the plate 87. When the force of the drive gears is sufficient to cause movement of the stub shafts in the plastic side frames it is found desirable to provide the auxilliary mounting plate for the stub shafts. Stub shaft holes 91 are provided in the side frame 57, 58. Plastic spacer washers 92 space the mounting plate 87 away from the side frame 57, 58 so as to provide a fluid passageway therebetween. Internally threaded nuts 93 such as PENN nuts are affixed to mounting plate 87 by welding, riveting or other appropriate means.Large flat head screws 94 are provided for fastening the mounting plate 87 to the side frame 57 or 58. A plurality of such screws 94 are provided to fasten the mounting plate and stub shafts to the side frame. The complete stub shaft assembly may be made employing fiber reinforced flex resistant high strength plastics. Refer now to Figure 13 showing an enlarged detail in elevation and in partial section a modified embodiment side frame having an inner steel frame attached to and reinforcing the plastic side frames 57, 58. In the preferred embodiment rack assembly shown in Figures 1 to 3 the side frames are relatively short and are designed to support approximately fifty to sixty rollers. However, in high speed processors the material path is very long so as to compensate for higher speeds through the processing tanks. It is not uncommon to provide up to three hundred very long rollers in one rack assembly. When some high speed processors require a large number of rollers in order to provide a long high speed material path through the rack assembly. The weight of the rollers can become sufficient to elongate the plastic side frames over a period of time. To avoid any possibility of elongation of the plastic side frames 57, 58 in high speed processors it is preferred to provide a reinforcing plate inside of each of the side frames 57, 58. Any of the aforementioned novel rollers may be employed in the Figure 13 embodiment. For purposes of this explanation, the rollers 82 shown in Figure 8 are illustrated. The roller 82 is inserted through aperture 12 in side frame 57 and through aperture 13 in side frame 58 as explained hereinbefore. The short pin 81 is held relative to side frame 58 by shoulder 84 and fastening means 86.The gear pin 95 may be long or short and as explained hereinbefore does not effect the axial alignment and the clearance between the roller and the apertures in the side frames. Either or both of pins 81 and 95 may be molded integrally with roller 82 or provided as separate pins. Spacer rods or bars 32 are fastened to the steel reinforcing frame 95 by means of large head screws 33. A roller aperture 96 is provided in frame 95 and a roller aperture 97 is provided in the opposite reinforcing frame 98. Thus, roller 82 is inserted in side frames 57 and 58 as if the reinforcing frame 95 and 97 did not exist. Access apertures 99 may be provided in side frames 57 and 58 to permit access to the fastening screws 33. However, since the spacer rods are at the outside edges of the side frames 57, 58 such access apertures may not be necessary. A plurality of fasteners are provided on reinforcing frames 95, 98. One such fastener is shown which is the same type as that shown in Figure 12. ThePENN nut is fixed to the reinforcing frame 95 and the large head screw 94 is applied from the outside of the side frame 57 and threaded into the internal threads of nut 93 to secure reinforcing frame 95 to side frame 57. It will be appreciated that a large number of such fasteners will be required when side frame 57, 93 is large. While there is some elongation or movement of the stainless steel reinforcing frames 95, 97 the amount of elongation due to stress and thermal changes does not effect the accuracy of the processor. The reason for spacing the reinforcing frames 95, 97 apart from the side frames 57, 58 is to prevent entrapment of chemicals and materials and to provide passageways for cleaning out the rack assemblies. Refer now to Figure 14 showing an enlarged detail of a modified roller of the type shown in Figure 5. Roller 100 is a hollow tube made by casting, molding or extruding. The roller 100 is sufficiently rigid to prevent undesirable deflection. The left end of roller 100 is open and the right end is sealed with a gudgeon or plug 101 having a cylindrical recess therein adapted to receive shaft 45 therein. Annular recess 102 is adapted to retain adhesives therein when shaft 45 is inserted in the gudgeon short of the full depth of the cylindrical recess. Gear shaft 45 is provided with a cylindrical bearing pin portion which extends through the aperture 13 in plastic side frame 59.Gears 71 and 69 are provided with a D shaped aperture not shown which provides means for fixing gears 71 and 69 to the flat on shaft 45 . A flexible washer 86 engages grooves 83 to provide fastening means to maintain gears 71t and 69 on shaft 45 . Extension 70 on gear 71 provides a thrust shoulder which engages the outer surface of side frame 59. An optional annular thrust washer 104 on shaft 45 provides a thrust bearing between gudgeon 101 and side frame 59. As explained hereinbefore, the gudgeon 101 forming the end of roller 100 may be employed as a thrust bearing. While some end play of roller 100 is desirable, the left end of roller 100 is maintained in bearing aperture 12. Refer now to Figure 15 showing a modified form of roller 100 of the type shown in Figure 14. An end plug 105 is employed to seal hollow roller 100 and to prevent processing chemicals from entering the hollow roller 100. A short pin on shaft 55 is supported in gudgeon 101 which forms a seal in the right end of roller 100. Thrust washers 104 and 106 may be provided on either or both sides of side frame 59 opposite the bearing pin portion of shaft 55 supported in aperture 13. A single drive gear 52 is mounted on the D shaped portion of shaft on bearing pin 55 . Grooves 83 on pin 55 are adapted to receive a flexible washer like washer 86 to maintain gear 52 on shaft 55 . In the modified embodiments shown in Figures 14 and 15, shafts or pins 45 and 55 are inserted in gudgeons 101 before the rollers are inserted into the side frames 58 and 59 in the positions shown. Gears 51 , 69 and 71 are adapted to be slidably mounted on the flats of the shafts 55 and 45 after the rollers 100 are in place. While bearing pins 45 and 55 are shown mounted in right side frame 59 with drive gears thereon, it is possible to alternate the drive gears and gear shafts on both sides so that drive gears are provided at either or both side frames 58 and 59 as explained hereinbefore. An advantage to employing hollow rollers 100 is that they are lighter than solid roller and employ less plastic materiaL The rollers 100 may be made very light while maintaining their rigidity.The lightness of the hollow rollers permits longer and deeper racks to be made without increasing the tendancy of the plastic side frames 58 and 59 to elongate. Reinforcing frames 95 and 97 may be eliminated for most of the racks made by employing hollow rollers 100. In the preferred embodiment rack assemblies shown in Figures 1 to 3, the side frames 11 and 31 maybe made of thin, high density plastic such as DELRIN made by Du Pont Corporation or NORYL made by General Electric Company.Some forms of high density, friction resistant nylon sheet material made by DuPont Corporation as well as high density polyethylene plastics made by several corporations may be employed for the side frames of the preferred embodiment rack assemblies. These plastics including cast nylon, have been found to offer excellent friction resistant and wear resistant qualities when employed with hard plastic rollers made from molding plastics such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride. Having explained a preferred embodiment of the present invention and several modifications of the rollers so as to provide roller bearings surfaces which engage plastic side frames it will be appreciated that the present invention rollers may be made much cheaper than rollers employed in prior art roller processors. Further, the time required for assembling large numbers of rollers in rigid and semi rigid side frames of prior art roller processors has been reduced substantially. In addition to reducing the price of the rollers and the time required for assembling the rollers in the side frames, the present roller rack assembly provides much higher accuracy of the location of the center of rotation or central axis of the rollers than was previously provided. In addition to reducing the cost of the rollers and the assembly time of the rack assemblies the accuracy of the alignment of the pins and shafts on the individual rollers has been enhanced by integrally molding either the extension pins or the recess for the extension pins with the roller. Thus, the extension pin is accurately concentric with the roller regardless of whether the extension pin is molded integrally with the roller or the extension pin is added in the molded recess in the roller. Having explained a preferred embodiment roller rack assembly, further modifications and alterations will be suggested to those skilled in the art of designing and producing roller rack assemblies employing plastic friction resistant side frames for bearing plates to support rollers which may be mounted between side frames by inserting the rollers from the outside of the side frame.If large bearing apertures are provided in both side frames for the same roller, additional fasteners and thrust bearing means, such as spring fingers, are employed to avoid axial movement of the rollers.
