# HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUIT BREAKER WITH IMPROVED PUFFER MEANS

## Abstract
A gas circuit breaker of the puffer type provided with a puffer cylinder with one or more apertures that relieve the back pressure created by the rapid expansion of the puffer chamber during the contact closing stroke. The pressure re lieving apertures are shaped and located so that they automati cally open and close at predetermined positions of the move ment of the puffer cylinder and the movable contact relative to the stationary piston, without the need of check valves.
