The cups were placed in a room of a 260C artificial atmosphere and the dead and alive were examined to determined the mortality 24 hours thereafter.EMI29.1 tb SEP ConcentratIon tb Compounds SEP pom SEP and tb tested SEP mortalit tb SEP 500 SEP 100 SEP tb SEP 1 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 2 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 3 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 4 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 5 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP 9 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb Test Example 4 Controlling effect against Tetranychus cinnabarinus Four leaves of potted kidney bean plant of 5 days after sowing, were parasitized with the adult female Tetranychus cinnabarinus at a rate of 10 insects per leaf and kept in a 27 C constant temperature room. 6 Days after, a solution prepared by diluting the emulsifiable concentrate of Preparation Example 1 with water to a 500 ppm active ingredient concentration was sprayed at a rate of 10 cc per pot on a turntable.10 Days thereafter, the number of the insects parasitic on the plant was counted. Judgment of the controlling effect of the compounds was based on the following rating 0 9 insects are parasitic per leaf 10 30 insects are parasitic per leaf more than 30 insects are parasitic per leaf The results are shown in the following table.EMI30.1 tb Compounds SEP of SEP Judgment tb this SEP invention tb SEP 1 SEP SEP tb SEP 2 SEP tb Chlorodimeform SEP tb No SEP treatment tb X 1,000 times diluted solution of a 50 emulsion of N 2 methyl 4 chlorophenyl N,N dimethyl formamidine Test Example 5 The dust obtained in Preparation Example 3 was dusted by Bell jar duster to the tillering stage rice plants in the 1 10,000 are Wagner pots at a rate of 3 kg 10 ares, and the plants were covered with the wire net cages. Then about 15 each of adult Nethotettix cincticeps and Laodelphax striatellus were released and fed in each cage.The pots were kept in a greenhouse and the dead and alive of the insects were observed 24 hours after release of the insects. Each of said powder was capable of killing said both species of adult 100 .Test Example 6 5 All each of the oil solution obtained inPreparation Example 6 was sprayed to the housefly adults about 100 flies per group according to theCampbell s turn table method Soap and Sanitary chemicals,Vol. 14, No. 6, p. 119 138 , and when the flies were exposed to descending mist of the oil preparation for 10 minutes, the flies were killed 100 by any of the oil solution. Test Example 7 The adult housefly killing effect of the aerosols obtained in PreparatIon Examples 7 and 8 was examined according to an aerosol test method CSilA method using a Peet Grady chamber 6 ft3 . The results showed that either of the aerosols could knock do 80 or more of the flies at 15 minutes after spray, and 90 or more of the flies were dead at 24 hours after spray.
