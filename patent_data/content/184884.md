## Description
A surplus cord holder Background t the InyentLQ This invention generally relates to a surplus cord holder for storing a slack of a cord of the kind generally defined in the preamble of claim 1. More specific, ally the invention is directed to cords for electrical and electronic appliances, although the invention, of course, is not restricted hereto. Cords of lighting accessories and other electrical appliances have either a length which is initially dimensioned just for its intended, use, or a length which is too great or too small. In those instances where the cord is too short an extension cord is often used which means that the total length of the composite cord becomes too great even in this instance. Apart from those cases where the cord is initially dimensioned just for its intended purpose, all cases do consequently have too long a cord Long cords entail risks of accidents, e.g. in that persons may stumble on the cord and in that pieces of furniture and other heaver objects may damage the cord when being moved which in its turn entails a risk of electrical chock or fire. In view hereof so called cord or slack shorteners of different kinds have been devised. One type comprises a winder or a spool US A 2 587 707 on to which the slack of the cord is wound. Another known cord shorterner FR B 2 519 617 comprises a box or the like into which the slack of the cord is introduced. These known slack shorterners suffer from serious drawbacks in that they either can not hold a sufficient length of cord on account of the spool or the like or are too complicated and expensive in manufacture. Summary of the Invention The principal object of the invention is to provide an improved surplus cord holder for storing a slack of a cord which is intended particularly for electrical appliances, such as lamps, radio and TV apparatus, loudspeakers and stereo equipments, telephones and so on, and also can be used in other fields of the technique. Another object of this invention is to provide a cord holder for enclosing a surplus cord length and for gripping the cord at opposite ends of the surplus length to retain the surplus cord length in the holder. A further object is to provide a cord holder which is simple in structure and presents a neat and ornamental appearance. These objects are attained thanks to the fact that the surplus cord holder according to the invention is featured according to the characterizing clause of claim 1. Brief Description of the DrawinSs Further features and advantages of the surplus cord holder according to the invention will become apparent from the following description and the annexed drawings which diagrammatically and as non limiting example illustrate a preferred embodiment and in which Fig. 1 is a perspective side view of an empty cord holder according to the invention, without end cap Fig. 2 is a perspective side vi ew of the cord holder after the completion of the slack insertion operation Fig. 3 is a partial perspective end view illustrating the end cap when fitted to the open end of the body of the cord holder after the insertion of the cord slack therein rig. 4 is a cross sectional view on a larger scale of the encircled area A in Fig. 3i Fig. 5 is a perspective view of said end cap Fig. 6 is a perspective view of an elastical clamping member for holding or supporting the surplus cord holder Fig. 7 is a perspective side view of the cord holder provided with the clamping member according toFig. 6 Fig. 8 is a side view of a cord with a slack folded several times upon itself Fig. 9 illustrates the first step of the introduction of the cord slack into the cord holder and Fig. 10 illustrates a subsequent step of the insertion operation. Description of thepreferred Embodiment The principal component of the surplus cord holder according to the invention is an elongated, tubular shell 1 which has an open end 2 and is provided with a slot 3 extending longitudinally from end to end of the shell 1.The slot 3 is sufficiently wide to permit the introduction of a standrad, two conductor plug in cord for electrical lamps and the like. One end the upper one in Figs. 1, 2, 7, 9 and 101 4 of the shell is perwanently closed by an end member 4 which is preferably integral with the shell 1. The end member has a slot which is generally designated 5 and constitutes a direct continuation of the slot 3 of the shell 1. The slot 5 comprises an enlargement 6 through which the cord can run freely, and a narrower inner end 7 which preferably is located centrally and so dimensioned that its edges frictionally engage the outer surface of said electrical standard cord. With the other end of the shell 1 which has been left open at the manufacture of the shell there is associated an end cap which is generally designated 9 and is best shown in Figs. 3 5. The end cap 9 has a substantially radial slot which corresponds to the slot 5 of the other end of the shell 1 and is generally designated 10. Like slot 5 the slot 10 has a narrower end portion 11 which is preferably centrally located and which is so dimensioned that its edges frictionally engage the outer surface of the cord. As is best shown in Fig. 4 the cap 9 is provided with a waist or annular recess 12 into which an internal, annular projection or upset 13 at the lower end 2 of the shell 1 is intended to snap in when the end cap 9 is joined to the shell. Fig. 6 illustrates an elastical clamping member or clamp associated with the shell 1 for holding or supporting the cord holder. The clamp which is generally designated 14 ha a central body portion 15 from which two arcuate arms 16 extend in opposite directions. The body portion 15 has a through hole 17 for a screw or the like by means of which the clamp 14 may be secured to a wall panel or the like. The arms 16 have a curvature which conforms to that of the circumference of the shell 1, and a combined length exceeding half of the circumference of the shell 1. The gap 18 between the free ends of the arms 16 is less than the diameter or cross dimension of the shell 1.Thus, when the clamp 14 has been affixed to a wall or another support the cord holder can be pushed in through the gap 18 to be held in a frictional grip by the arms 16 of the clamp secured to the wall or the like. The elasticity or resiliency of the arms 16 is so proportioned that the cord holder comes loose at a slight pull in the cord, whereby damages to the cord are prevented. Figs 8 10 illustrate the insertion of a cord 20 having a surplus length or slack into the cord holder according to the invention. A length of the cord 20 corresponding to the slack is folded several times upon itself into a skein 21 the turns of which are compressed Fig. 8 and given a length which is a little shorter than that of the cord holder 1. Subsequently the cord 20 is introduced into the longitudinal slot 3 and the radial slot 5 in which it is suitably positioned in the enlargement 6, as is shown inFig. 9. After that that portion of the cord, which is located immediately above the cord holder in Fig. 9, is pressed in into the shell 1 in the direction of the arrow B in Fig. 9. This operation may be carried out by pulling the skein 21 leftwards in Fig. 9. In the next step the skein 21 is pushed upwards in the direction of the arrow C in Fig. 10 into the shell 1 until the skein in its entirety is located in the shell. After that one inserts the end cap 9 into the lower open end 2 of the shell 1 and in so doing snaps the upset 13 into engagement with the annular recess 12. Finally, the cord 20 is locked by being pushed into engagement with the edges of the inner, central ends 7 and 11 of the radial slots 5 and 10, respectively, at the opposite ends of the cord holder. The cord holder may hang vertically since the cord 20 is locked along the centre line of the shell 1. The embodiment described above and illustrated in the drawings is, of course, to be regarded merely as a nonlimiting example and may as to its details be modified in several ways within the scope of the following claims.Thus, it may be given an oval, triangular, square or poly gonal cross section instead of being substantially circular cylindrical as shown. It may also taper insigni ficantly to provide a relief at the manufacture. Finally the cord slack holder according to the invention is not restricted to electrical cords but may be used also in connection with non electric cords, such as cables, ropes and wires.
