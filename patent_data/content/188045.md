# Deformable chuck.

## Abstract
A deformable vacuum pin chuck includes a thin silicon chuck 17 for supporting a semiconductor wafer 1 during lithographic processing and a number of piezo electric transducers 9 for selectively deforming the chuck. Chuck deformation caused by application of electric potentials to selected transducers may be used to correct flatness devia tions in the wafer and, thereby, a desired degree of flatness of the semiconductor wafer may be obtained.
