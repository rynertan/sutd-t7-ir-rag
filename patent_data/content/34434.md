# Process for removing metal values from oxidic materials.

## Abstract
Low grade oxidic ores, such as, for example, chromite, tantalite, wolframite, ilmenite or bauxite may be beneficiated by chlorinating the ore in a fluidised bed in the presence of carbon to produce a gaseous effluent containing ferrous chloride, partially oxidising the ferrous chloride to a mixture of ferric oxide and iron chloride, condensing and then revolatilising the iron chloride, oxidising the revolatilised iron chloride to release chlorine and recycling the chlorine to the ore chlorination. The process lends itself to efficiency of oper ation. The ore may be preheated by the combustion of carbon utilising also the combustion of volatiles from the calcining of the carbon. Preferably, sufficient carbon is present during the ore preheating to supply also the needs of the chlorination. Preferably solid iron chloride is volatilised in the gaseous effluent from the chlorination. Iron oxide recovered may be used as a coolant in steel making. The residual beneficiated ores may be used in the production of special steels or for other uses. In a modification of the process values of metals other than iron such as, for example, values of boron, gallium, zirconium, thorium, titanium or uranium aluminium or sili con, may be removed from ore.
