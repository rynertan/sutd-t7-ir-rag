## Description
SMOOTHING COMPOSITION IN DRY AND WET FORM CONTAININGHYDRATED CALCIUM SULPHATE AND CEMENT AND A METHOD OFAPPLYING THE WET COMPOSITION TO A FLOOR OR WALL The present invention relates to a surface treatment composition, which is intended for smoothing floor and wall surfaces and of the kind which contains cement, fly ash and gypsum as bonding agents, and aggregate. Water is added to such a composition to produce desired consistency for application to the surface.The term gypsum is used generically in this specification to mean hydrated calcium sulphate, of which CaSO4. 1 2 H20 and CaS04. 2H20 are examples.In modern construction, a great deal of concrete is used for the production of both walls and floors. However, the concrete surface obtained is not sufficiently smooth for the attachment of the final wall or floor covering. For this reason, the unevenness of the surface has to be eliminated using various smoothing and finishing plasters.There is known a finishing mix, based on an anhydrite bonding agent, used for smoothing floor surfaces in addition to the anhydrite bonding agent it contains an accelerator K2S04 , a methyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose which retards setting, a surfactant, and a resin modified with sulfite or sulfonic acid and based on an amino s triazine containing at least two NH2 groups, in which case, by adding water 0.17 0.5 parts by weight, calculated on the basis of the weight of the anhydrite bonding agent , a self leveling mix is obtained, which spreads fluidly before setting so that a smooth surface is obtained.This known mix can also contain other additives which improve the properties and fluidity of the mix, such as surfactants, a defoaming agent, and the like.Cement based smoothing plasters are also known. They have a disadvantage in that they shrink upon hydration and shrink extensively upon drying, which is due to the fact that a large amount of water must be used, especially in plasters intended for smoothing floors, in order to obtain a readily fluid plaster. The shrinkage upon drying easily increases to such a degree that cracking and detachment from the base occur in the surface treatment plaster.Attempts have been made to eliminate the disadvantages due to the extensive shrinkage upon drying by using in such smoothing mixes relatively large quantities of. dispersions made from plastics such as polyvinyl acetate or acqLc polymer, or other organic additives, the purpose of which is to lower the elasticity coefficient of the set mix and thereby reduce the tendency of the mix to crack and become detached from the base. However, by using these admixtures it has not been possible to reduce the shrinkage upon drying, but only to reduce its effects. Also, in addition to being expensive these known additives have an adverse effect in that they reduce the fluidity of the mix and thereby complicate working with the mix.The object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a surface treatment composition the drying shrinkage of which has at least in part been compensated for in such a manner that the shrinkage upon drying after the setting of the mix is so insignificant that no cracking of the coating or detachment from the base occurs, the properties of the surface treatment composition being easily variable to suit other applications. According to the invention, this problem has been solved as follows in order to produce expansion which at least in part compensates for the shrinkage upon drying of the surface treatment composition disclosed in the preamble, the composition comprises gypsum hereinbefore defined, preferably CaSO4. 1 2 H20 , cement, preferably a Portland cement, and fly ash bonding agents in the weight 1 5 25 5 20, respectively, aggregate, preferably fine sand, and an agent which retards reaction of the bonding agents, preferably a protein agent, e.g. casein or bone glue. The invention includes such a composition in dry or wet form and it also includes a method of smoothing the surface of a floor or wall by applying a smoothing layer of the wet composition thereto, preferably by pumping, and then allowing it to dry.An advantageous concentration of protein is generally 0.2 1.5 by weight, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition. The preferred proportion of gypsum is about 3 by weight, on the same basis.One preferred composition according to the invention, intended for smoothing floor surfaces is characterised in that it contains 20 50 by weight of cement, 20 40 by weight of fly ash, 2 5 by weight of gypsum, and 25 55 by weight of aggregate, preferably fine sand, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition, the reaction velocity retarder being casein.Another preferred composition according to the invention, intended for smoothing wall surfaces, is characterized in that it contains 10 40 by weight of cement, 10 40 by weight of fly ash, 1 5 by weight of gypsum, and 40 75 by weight, of aggregate preferably fine sand, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition, the reaction velocity retarder being bond glue. The composition according to the invention can also contain admixtures which improve the properties of the composition. Thus the composition can contain a water retainer such as a cellulose derivatives, its concentration being preferably 0.01 0.5 by weight, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition.Furthermore, the composition can contain a defoaming agent, the concentration of which is preferably 0.01 0.5 by weight1 calculated from the total dry matter of the composition. In addition, the composition can contain an agent which improves adhesion, e.g a polyvinyl acetate based polymer, the concentra tion of which is preferably 0.5 5 by weight, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition. Further, the composition can also contain an agent such as urea which improves the fluidity, preferably at a concentration of 0.5 1.5 t by weight, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition. Usually when the agent for retarding the reaction velocity is a protein, the total proportion of protein and additive s , especially those mentioned above, is from 2 to 3 by weight, calculated from the total dry matter of the composition. The present invention is based on the idea that by using a certain ratio of gypsum to fly ash and by retarding the reactions of the bonding agents, a product is obtained in which slow expansion occurs, compensating at least in part for the normal shrinkage upon drying. Thus the surface treatment composition according to the invention is suitable for smoothing indoor building surfaces in which the drying is relatively rapid and the equilibrium moisture of the mix stabilizes at a level required by the environment.It is a known method to mix fly ash and gypsum with cement, whereby a mixture is obtained which sets after the addition of water and has expansive properties. According to the theories of conventional concrete technology, however, the ratios of cement, fy ash and gypsum according to the present invention have never been used, since in massive structures such a mix would continue expanding and would easily exceed the maximum values set for the expansion of concrete structures. The surface treatment composition according to the invention is highly applicable to the smoothing of concrete floors before the attachment of the final covering. As known, a large quantity of water is used in such compositions in order to obtain good fluidity, in order that the applied mix spread as a sufficiently smooth surface. The composition according to the invention can be applied by pumping to the floor surface to be smoothed, and the mix spreads, forming a completely smooth surface. In spite of the high concentration of water in the mix, its post setting shrinkage upon drying is so insignificant that no cracks or detachment from the floor surface occur in the smoothing coat.However, if previously known cement based surface treatment compositions and the same pumping technique are used, there is the risk that1 as a result of the great shrinkage upon drying, the smoothing coat cracks and becomes detached from the floor surface.The following examples are given to illustrate the invention.All proportions are by weight.Example 1The following series of experiments was performed to show the expansion effect obtained using a surface treatment composition according to the invention, compared with other compositions. 4 different compositions were prepared, their constituents being given below No. 1 no gypsum , No. 2 fly ash gypsum ratio greater than 20 1 and No. 4 cement gypsum and fly ash gypsum ratios both less than 5 1 are the comparative compositions. 1 2 3 4 Portland cement 20 20 20 20 Fly ash 23 23 23 23 CaSO4 1 2 H20 0 1 3 5 Sand 0 0.6 mm 54.32 53.32 51.32 49.32 Casein and other admixhres 2.64 2.64 .2.68 2.68 Water t, calculated from total dry matter 20.00 20.00 20.00 20.00 Prisms of 25 x 25 x 250 mm were made from the compositions they were allowed to set in molds for 48 h.

An analysis of these compositions is given below.The water quantity used for the mixes was selected so that each mix had the same viscosity after mixing.To compare the shrinkage upon drying, prisms of 25 x 25 x 250 mm were cast from each plaster. The molds were removed after 2 days, and metallic measuring points were glued to the prisms.The distance between the points was measured immediately in order to obtain the initial value. Thereafter, the specimen prisms were kept in an air conditioned room, at 65 RH and 22 OC, and the deformations of the prisms were measured daily.The results are given below in Table 2.
