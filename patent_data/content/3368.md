# A shear pin coupling.

## Abstract
A shear pin coupling comprises two coupling parts 6 and 7 which are normally interconnected by a shear pin 24 . Upon overload, the shear pin 24 fractures and the parts 6 and 7 can rotate relatively to one another. After fracture, the shear pin 24 is advanced by a spring loaded plunger 26 to re interconnect the coupling parts 6 and 7 . The shear pin 24 and the plunger 26 are shaped to prevent displacement of the shear pin 24 in a direction other than its lengthwise direction. The end 27 of the pin 24 may be conical for this purpose.
