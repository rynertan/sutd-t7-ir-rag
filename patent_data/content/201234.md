## Description
The present invention refers to a digital reading device for reading documents to be transmitted by facsimile apparatus, as defined in the preamble to claim 1. As is known, when the reading elements are constituted by cells of a CCD Charge Coupled Device sensor focused by an objective, the amplitude of the signal generated by these elements falls off at high spatial frequencies, both because of the modulation transfer function MTF of the objective and because of the MTF of the CCD. From G.B. Patent Application GB A 2,091,967 is known an image signal processing apparatus in which compensation for the CCDs is performed through a digital process by acting on the digitalized signal after an A D converter. In the above cited prior art, the compensation is effected under the control of a peak detector including a peak hold circuit, which determines the amount of correction to be applied to a multiplier circuit in an outline emphasis digital circuit or filter for digitally equalizing the digital image signal in the two dimensional frequency domain. This latter circuit includes shift registers, latches, adder and subtractors, and multiplier circuits, all typical of digital operating circuits. It is thus evident that the equalizing circuit of the above prior art reference is rather intricate and expensive. Therefore an object of the present invention is to provide a reading device in which the fall off of the analog image signal can be effectively eliminated which is of simplified construction. To this end the device according to the invention is defined as in the characterising part of claim 1. The invention will be described in more detail by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to Fig 1, a transparent support plate 10 for a document to be read is fixed and is covered by a hinged cover 12, adapted to hold the document in contact with the plate 10. Adjacent to the cover 12 there is located a keyboard 13 for controlling the digital reader. The latter comprises two fluorescent lamps 14, carried by a first carriage 16 which is movable transversely in order to explore the whole length of the document, in a manner known in itself. The carriage 16 carries a mirror 17 inclined at 45 The reader in addition comprises a second carriage 18 carrying a pair of mirrors 19 and 21 inclined 45 The cells of the CCD 23 are so spaced that each element can receive the light reflected by a small area of the document called a pixel. The number of pixels per mm, in general between 3 and 12, determines the horizontal resolution of the reading device. The number of elementary lines per mm, read on the document, on the other hand determines the vertical resolution of the reader. An image can be considered as formed by black and white pixels. The density of points, for example white ones, in an elementary line determines the spatial frequency of the respective pixels. This frequency is maximum when the cells of the CCD of the line receive alternately signals of white points and of black points. The cells of the CCD generate electrical signals which are sent serially to a circuit 27 Fig 2 for filtering and amplification. For this purpose the cells of the CCD 23 are associated with a sampling circuit of the sample and hold type not shown , which effects the sampling at the scanning frequency of the cells. The output signal from the circuit 27 is sent to analogue digital converter 28 and can then be coded, transmitted, stored and or reproduced on paper. It is known that the relationship between the optical intensity received by the objective 22 Fig 1 and that transferred from it, known as the modulation transfer function MTF of the objective, varies with spatial frequency of the signals. In Fig 3 the curve 29 shows on a logarithmic scale the MTF of the objective as a function of the spatial frequency. The curve 29 shows that the fall off of the MTF for the maximum spatial frequency in which the pixels are alternately white and black is about 30 . The curve 31 shows on the other hand the MTF of the CCD and demonstrates that the fall off of the respective MTF for the maximum spatial frequency is about 50 . This fall off is due to interaction between the contiguous cells of the CCD 23 and leakage of charge in the cells of the CCD 23. In Fig 3 the curve 32 shows the combined effect of the two curves 29 and 31, with a maximum fall off of the overall MTF down to about 30 . According to the invention, the circuit 27 Fig 2 is provided so as to compensate for the combined effect of the fall off of the MTF of the objective and of the MTF of the CCD. In particular, the circuit 27 matches the response of the objective and the CCD to the various spatial frequencies, emphasising in amplitude the appropriate signal at high frequencies. The circuit 27 further amplifies this signal in voltage and in current so as to bring it to a value suitable for the conversion into a digital signal by the converter 28. In particular the circuit 27 comprises a first stage 33 Fig 4 constituted by an amplifier 34 of the emitter follower type, in which a capacitor C1 provides the function of a low pass filter. The stage 33 is linked to a second filtering stage 36, comprising an operational amplifier 37 with a voltage gain of 5. An input of the amplifier 37 is coupled to the amplifier 34 through a high pass filter C3, while its output is coupled to the same input by a low pass filter C4, whereby the stage 36 has the function of a 6dB band pass filter. The other input of the amplifier 37 is coupled to an adjustable resistance T1, which can be adjusted to cancel the continuous component of the CCD signal. Thus the offset of 7 volts in the signal of the CCD is cancelled to bring the level in the absence of signal to Ov. The output of the amplifier 37 is coupled to another filter stage 38, known as a modified second order Butterworth filter. This comprises an operational amplifier 39 with unitary voltage gain. An input of the amplifier 39 is coupled to the output of the amplifier 37 by a high pass filter C6, while two capacitors C5 and C7 create a low pass filter, whereby the stage 38 has the function of a 12 dB band pass filter. This contributes substantially to eliminating the noise of the CCDs generated by the superimposition of the sampling signals. The output of the amplifier 39 is coupled to a further stage 41, which comprises another operational amplifier 42 with voltage gain from 2 to 6. The output voltage is adjustable by means of a variable resistance T2, in order to adapt to the value suitable for the A D conversion. The input of the amplifier 42 is coupled to the amplifier 39 by a high pass filter C8 with feedback through a low pass filter C9, whereby the stage 41 also acts as a 6 dB band pass filter. Finally the output of stage 41 is coupled through a high pass filter C10 to a stage 43 comprising an amplifier 44 of the emitter follower type. Fig 3 shows the equalisation graph 46 of the MTF obtained with the circuit of Fig 4. It can be seen that this substantially coincides with the ideal graph 47 complementary to the graph 32, up to a frequency of 1.4 MHz which corresponds to a spatial frequency of about 20 pixel mm. Above this frequency the curve 46 falls off rapidly, but these spatial frequencies are of no practical interest. In Fig 5 in line a there are shown on a much enlarged scale the pixels of a part of an elementary scanning line. In line b there is shown the unfiltered signal emitted by the CCD, i.e. the signal entering stage 33 Fig 4 . It can be seen that the lower level of the signal b Fig 5 , due to the reading of the white pixels, and the higher level, due to the reading of the black pixels, are serrated because of the noise of the signal caused by sampling. It can further be seen that corresponding to the zone 48, where the spatial frequency is greater, the amplitude of the signal is noticeably reduced. In line c on the other hand there is shown the filtered signal issuing from stage 43. This shows how the noise of the CCD has disappeared and the recovery in amplitude of the signal in the zone 48. The inversion of polarity of the signal of line c with regard to line b is due to the uneven number of stages of inverting amplification which constitute the filter.
