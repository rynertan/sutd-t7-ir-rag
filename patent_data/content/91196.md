# Adrenosteroid composition.

## Abstract
Septic shock and other forms of shock are effectively treated using a blend of 18 different adrenosteroids in their physiologic ratios based upon an animal cortex extract as a model. The blend is preferably administered by infusion to a person suffering from shock. The blend is more effect and at a lower dosage level than hydrocortisone base or water soluble derivatives of hydrocortisone.
