## Description
Description ROTARY ACTUATOR WITH BACKLASH ELIMINATIONCross Reference to Related Applications This is a continuation in part of application Serial No. 575,228, filed January 30, 1984, and application Serial No. 662,256, filed October 17, 1984.Technical Field The present invention relates generally to actu ators, and more particularly, to fluid powered actuators of the type in which axial movement of a piston produces rela tive movement between a body and an output member. Background Art Rotary helically splined actuators have been employed in the past to achieve the advantages of high torque output from a simple linear piston and cylinder drive arrangement. The actuators typically employed a cylindrical body with an elongated rotary output shaft extending from end to end coaxially within the body, with an end portion of the shaft providing the drive output. Disposed between the body and the shaft is a piston sleeve spl ned tocooperate,with corresponding splines on the body interior and the output shaft exterior. The piston is reciprocally mounted within the body and has a head for the application of fluid pressure to one or the other opposing sides thereof to produce axial movement of the piston. The sleeve is elongated and coaxially receives the shaft therein. As the piston linearly reciprocates in an axial direction within the body, the outer splines of the sleeve engage the splines of the body to cause rotation of the sleeve. The resulting linear and rotational movement of the sleeve is transmitted through the inner splines of the sleeve to the splines of the shaft to cause the shaft to rotate. Bearings are typically supplied to rotatably support one or both ends of the shaft relative to the body. With such an arrangement, as the piston reciprocally moves from one axial direction to the other to produce relative rotational movement between the body and the shaft in respone to application of fluid pressure to the piston head, backlash results from the slack existing between the intermeshing splines of the piston sleeve and the body and the intermeshing splines of the piston sleeve and the shaft. While accurate machining of the splines will reduce the backlash problem, this procedure substantially increases the manufacturing cost. Even with accurate machining, conventional machining techniques are virtually incapable of totally eliminating the slack which produces the backlash problem. Furthermore, to the extent more accurate tolerances produce actuator parts which fit tightly together and reduce slack, assembly of the actuator becomes difficult.While accurate machining reduces slack initially, should the splined parts wear during usage or otherwise lose their original tolerances, no means exist for elimination of the slack that develops without disassembly of the actuator and possible remachining or replacement of the splined parts. It will therefore be appreciated that there has been a sig fffCant need for aifluid powered rotary actuator which does not require exceptionally accurate machining of the torque transmitting parts to eliminate slack that produces backlash. The actuator should be easy to assemble and provide means for substantially complete elimination of the slack causing the backlash problem after the actuator is assembled. Elimination of the slack should be accomplished in a simple manner without requiring disassembly of the torque transmitting parts from the body. Furthermore, the means for elimination of the slack should, with one adjustment, simultaneously remove the slack existing between all of the torque transmitting parts within the body which translate linear movement of the piston into rotational movement of the output member.Means should also be provided for automatic elimination of backlash during both assembly of the actuator and its subsequent use without requiring any adjustment by the user, particularly for actuators of small size which have space limitations.The present invention fulfills this need and further provides other related advantages.Disclosure of Invention The present invention resides in a fluid powered actuator having a body, a rotatable member supported for rotation relative to the body and connectable to an external device, first and second coaxial members reciprocally mounted within the body, and at least one piston reciprocally mounted within the body for application of fluid pressure to one or the other opposing sides thereof to produce axial movement of the piston. The piston operatively engages at least one or the other of the first and second members to axially move the members in response to axial movement of the piston. The first and second members are independently rotatable. The actuator further includes first torque transmitting means for transmitting torque between the first member and the body, second torque transmitting means for transmitting torque between the first member and the rotatable member, third torque transmitting means for transmitting torque between the second member and the rotatable member, and fourth torque transmitting means for transmitting torque between the second member and the body. The first, second, third and fourth torque transmitting means further provide for unidirectional movement of the first and second members in one and then the other axial direction as the piston reciprocates during fluid powered operation. The linear movement of the piston produces relative rotational movement between the body and the rotatable member. The actuator also has adjustment means for selectively moving the first member relative to the second member to axially preload the first and second members for substantially eliminating backlash as the piston moves from one axial direction to the other. As such, backlash resulting from slack in the first, second, third and fourth torque transmitting means can be avoided by adjustment prior to fluid powered operation of the actuator. In the first embodiment of the invention, the rotatable member includes first and second coaxially mounted and independently rotatable portions, with the first portion being positioned adjacent to the second portion. The second torque transmitting means transmits torque between the first member and the first portion, and the third torque transmitting means transmits torque between the second member and the second portion. In this first embodiment, the adjustment means includes means for selectively rotating the first portion relative to the second portion by a selected amount to axially preload the first and second members.The selective rotating means includes a camming link extending between and bearing upon each of the first and second portions for relative rotational movement thereof in opposite rotational directions upon movement of the link to move the first and second members toward each other and into engagement. The first and secondLportions are annular in shape, and the first portion has an attachment flange extending outward beyond the body for attachment to the external device. In an another embodiment of the invention, the adjustment means includes a resilient member positioned between and engaging the first and second members. The resilient member is in a compressed state when in position between the first and second members and has sufficient resiliency to exert an axially outward force on the first and second members to move the first member relative to the second member for their axial preloading to substantially eliminate backlash. The axially outward force exerted by the resilient member is at least as great as the axially inward force exerted by the piston on the resilient member through the first and second members during normal fluidpowered operation of the actuator. As such, the preloading of the first and second members is substantially maintained during operation. In this embodiment, the piston has first and second piston portions positioned between the first and second members, with the resilient member positioned between and engaging the first and second piston portions.In one form of this embodiment, the resilient member is an elastomeric member sized to be placed in the compressed state between the first and second piston portions during assembly of the actuator, and the elastomeric member also serves as a piston seal. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the adjustment means includes an axially adjustable member extending between and engaging each of the first and second members. The adjustable member provides an adjustable and oppositely directed axial force on the first and second members to move the first member relative to the second member for axially preloading the first and second members.The adjustable member is adjustably attached to the second member and projects toward and slidably engages the first member. The adjustable member is selectively extendable to exert an axially outward force on the first and second members. Means are provided for access to the adjustable member through the body for external adjustment thereof without disassembling the second sleeve from the body. In the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, the first, second, third and fourth torquetransmitting means include coacting grooves formed on the first and second members, on the body, and on the rotatable member. The grooves may be intermeshing splines, ball races positioned in confronting and corresponding relationship to form ball channels with one or more balls seated in each of the channels, or screw threads positioned in corresponding relationship with one or more roller screws seated therebetween. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a side elevational, sectional view of a fluid powered helical ball screw actuator embodying the present invention and using a flanged output member Figure 2 is a fragmentary sectional view taken substantially along the lines 2 2 of Figure lj Figure 3 is a side elevational, sectional view of a second alternative embodiment of the invention, showing a ball screw actuator using an internally positioned resilient member Figure 4 is an end elevational view of the actuator of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a side elevational, sectional view of a third alternative embodiment of the invention, showing a ball screw actuator using a set screw adjustment Figure 6 is a side elevational, sectional view of a fourth alternative embodiment of the invention, showing a roller screw actuator using a set screw adjustment Figure 7 is a side elevational, sectional view of a fifth alternative embodiment of the invention, showing another roller screw actuator using a set screw adjustment and Figure 8 is a side elevational, sectional view of an sixth alternative embodiment of the invention, showing another roller screw actuator using a set screw adjustment.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the present invention is embodied in a fluid powered rotary actuator, indicated generally by reference numeral 10. A first embodiment of the actuator 10 is shown in Figure 1 and includes a generally cylindrical body 12 having first and second axially spaced apart end walls 14 and 16, and an exterior sidewall 18. The exterior sidewall 18 is formed by a pair of circumferentially extending first and second support arms 18a and 18b rigidly attached to the end walls 14 and 16. The first and second support arms 18a and 18b project generally axially inward from the first and second end walls 14 and 16, respectively, to define a circumferential space 20 therebetween. The actuator 10 further includes first and second coaxially oriented and independently rotatable annular members 22 and 24 positioned in the circumferential space 20 and supported for substantially coaxial rotation relative to the body 12 by ball bearings 26. The ball bearings 26 are disposed in confronting and corresponding pairs of ball races 28 formed on the axially inward facing end walls of the support arms 18a and 18b and the axially outward facing annular end walls of the annular member 22 and 24. The ball bearings 26 in the ball races 28 rotatably support the annular members 22 and 24 relative to the support arms 18a and 18b against axial thrust. The body 12 further includes a circumferential interior sidewall 30 extending between the end walls 14 and 16, and positioned radially inward from the exterior sidewall 18 to define an annular chamber 32 therebetween. The interior sidewall 30 is formed by a pair of circumferentially extending first and second interior sidewall sections 46 and 48 rigidly attached to the end walls 14 and 16, respectively, with a circumferential midsection wall 50 fixedly positioned therebetween. With such construction, the body 12 may be manufactured of two half assemblies, the first formed by the first support arm 18a, the first end wall 14 and the first interior sidewall section 46, and the other formed by the second support arm 18b, the second end wall 16 and the second interior sidewall section 48. The body half assemblies may be constructed as an integral unit, and may be secured together in fixed relative relation, with the midsection wall 50 positioned therebetween, by a plurality of elongated, circumferentially spaced fasteners 51. The fasteners 51 are positioned in bores extending between the half assemblies through the midsection wall 50. The actuator 10 further includes a cylindrical first piston sleeve 34 coaxially and reciprocally disposed within the chamber 32 toward the first end wall 14 and a second piston sleeve 36 coaxially and reciprocally disposed within the chamber toward the second end wall 16. The piston sleeves 34 and 36 each have a sleeve portion 38 and an annular piston head portion 40 fixedly attached thereto and located to an axially outward side thereof. The sleeve portions 38 of the gisten sleeves 34 and 36 are in endwise sliding engagement with each other, and the piston sleeves are independently rotatable within at least a limited range for backlash adjustment purposes, as will be described below. The piston head portion 40 of the first piston sleeve 34 defines a first fluid tight compartment 42 of the chamber 32 to an axially outward side of the head portion, and application of fluid pressure to the first compartment produces axial movement of the first piston sleeve toward the second end wall 16. The piston head portion 40 of the second piston sleeve 36 defines a fluid tight compartment 44 ofvthetchamber 32 to van axially outward side of the head portion, and application of fluid pressure to the second compartment produces axial movement of the second piston sleeve toward the first body end wall 14. The actuator 10 provides relative rotational movement between the body 12 and the annular members 22 and 24 through the conversion of linear movement of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 into rotational movement of the annular members. The piston head portions 40 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 each carry conventional inner and outer seals 52 disposed between the head portion and corresponding smooth interior wall portions of the exterior and interior sidewalls 18 and 30 to define the fluid tight compartments 42 and 44. The smooth sidewall wall portions have sufficient axial length to accommodate the full stroke of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 within the chamber 32. Reciprocation of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 within the chamber 32 occurs when hydraulic fluid or air under pressure selectively enters through ports 54 in the first and second end walls 14 and 16, which communicate with the fluid tight compartments 42 and 44. In the embodiment of the invention shown inFigure 1, the midsection wall 50 is manufactured of a hardened material and has a helical ball race 56 integrally formed on a radially outward facing wall. The radially inward facing walls of the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 each have a helical ball race 58 integrally formed thereon confronting and corresponding to the ball race 56 on the midsection wall 50. The ball races 56 and 58 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined, variable length inner ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the ball races on the first piston sleeve 34 and the midsection wall 50 and of the ball races on the second piston sleeve 36 and the midsection wall as the piston sleeves move axially within the chamber 32. The radially inward facing annular walls of the annular members 22 and 24 each Shave a helical ball race 60 integrally formed thereon. The radially outward facing walls of the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 each have a helical ball race 62 integrally formed thereon confronting and corresponding to the ball races 60 of the annular members 22 and 24. The ball races 60 and 62 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined, variable length outer ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the ball races on the first piston sleeve 34 and the first annular member 22 and of the ball races on the second piston sleeve 36 and the second annular member 24 as the piston sleeves move axially within the chamber 32. A plurality of balls 64 are disposed in each of the inner and outer channels for transmission of torque between the first annular member 22 and the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34, between the sleeve portion of the first piston sleeve and the midsection wall 50, between the midsection wall and the sleeve portion of the second piston sleeve 36, and between the sleeve portion of the second piston sleeve and the second annular member 24. In the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, one to eight balls are used in each channel.The midsection wall 50, the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36, and the annular members 22 and 24 are diametrically sized to produce minimal interspacing therebetween to increase ball contact with the inner and outer channels and promote improved torque transmission by the balls 64 carried therein. An inner stop ring 66 is fixedly attached to the midsection wall 50 at its midportion, and projects radially outward sufficiently to engage and limit the travel of balls 64 through the inner channel formed by the ball race 56 on the midsection wall and the ball race 58 on the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34 in the direction toward the second end wall 16. An additional stop i8 formed by a beveled edge 68 of the second interior sidewall section 48 abutting and adjacent to an end of the ball race 56 on the midsection wall 50. This stop engages and limits the travel of balls 64 through the inner channel formed by the ball race 56 on the midsection wall 50 and the ball race 58 on the sleeve portion 38 of the second piston sleeve 36 in the direction toward the second end wall 16. Similarly, an outer stop ring 70 is positioned between the annular members 22 and 24, and projects radially inward sufficiently to engage and limit the travel of balls 64 through the outer channel formed by the ball race 60 on the first annular member and the ball race 62 on the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34 in the direction toward the second end wall 16. An additional stop is formed by a beveled edge 72 of the second support arm 18b abutting and adjacent to an end of the ball race 60 of the second annular member 24. This stop engages and limits travel of the balls 64 through the outer channel formed by the ball race 60 on the second annular member 24 and the ball race 62 on the sleeve portion 38 of the second piston sleeve 36 in the direction toward the second end wall 16. A pair of stops 74 formed by the blocked ends of the ball races 58 and 62 of the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34 engage and collect the balls 64 in the inner and outer channels formed by the ball races of the midsection wall 50, the first piston sleeve and the first annular member 22 to regroup the balls toward the inner and outer stop rings 66 and 70 as the first piston sleeve travels in the direction toward the second end wall 16.A similar function is performed by a pair of inner and outer stop rings 76 positioned between the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36, and projecting sufficiently to engage and collect the balls 64 in the inner and outer channels formed by the ball races of the midsection wall 50, the second piston sleeve and the second annular member 24 to regroup the balls toward the beveled stop edges 68 and 72 as the second piston sleeve travels in the direction toward the second end wall 16. It is noted that the stops 74 and the stop rings 76 will only operate to regroup the balls in the inner and outer channels should they not roll fully against the stops limiting travel of the balls toward the second end wall 16 when the piston sleeves 34 and 36 complete their travel toward the second end wall. The dashed lines on the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 indicate the axial length of the sleeve portions over which the ball races 58 and 62 extend and the manner of termination of the ball races. It is noted that for the embodiment of Figure 1 the axially outward end of each of the ball races 58 and 62 terminates in a blocked end, and the ball races extend in the axially inward direction to the end of the sleeve portions 38 and the axially inward end of each of the ball races terminates in an open end running out into the chamber 32. The stop rings 76 prevent the balls 64 from passing out of the open ball race ends and into another open end. As the piston sleeves 34 and 36, and the sleeve portions 38 forming a part thereof, linearly reciprocate between one or the other axial direction within the chamber 32, torque is transmitted by the balls 64 through the coaction of the ball race 56 on the midsection wall 50 with the ball races 58 on the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves. The tra6smitted torque causes the piston sleeves 34 and 36 to rotate as they move axially. The resulting linear and rotational movement of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 is transmitted by the balls 64 through the coaction of the ball races 60 on the first and second annular members 22 and 24 with the ball races 62 on the piston sleeves 34 and 36.The transmitted torque causes the annular members 22 and 24 to rotate relative to the body 12 since axial movement of the annular members is resstricted by the support arms 18a and 18b. As such, axial movement of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 is converted into relative rota tional movement between the body 12 and the annular members 22 and 24. Since the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 are in engagement, the application of fluid pressure to the compartment 42 or 44 to move one piston sleeve in the direction toward the other will cause the other piston sleeve to move by the same amount, thereby producing simultaneous rotational movement of both annular members 22 and 24 in the same rotational direction. As measured with the piston sleeves 34 and 36 positioned with the piston head portion 40 of the first piston sleeve engaging the second end wall 16, as shown in Figure 1, the ball races 58 and 62 on the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve extend over an axial length of the sleeve portion projecting beyond the inner and outer stop rings 66 and 70 toward the second en d wall 16 at least one half of the distance of the end to end axial travel of the piston sleeves within the chamber 32. The balls 64 disposed in the inner and outer channels travel along the channels as they roll approximately one half the distance the piston sleeves travel with respect to the body 12.To accommodate the slower travel of the balls 64, the ball races must extend over a sufficient length of the sleeve portions 38 beyond the inner and outer stop rings 66 and 70 to allow free rolling of the balls within the inner and outer channels during the entire piston sleeve travel between its end limits and avoid scuffing of the balls. For the same reasons as discussed above, the ball races 58 and 62 on the sleeve portion 38 of the second piston sleeve 36 extend over an axial length of the sleeve portion projecting beyond the beveled stop edges 68 and 72 toward the second end wall 16 at least one half of the distance of the end to end axial travel of the piston sleeve within the chamber 32. To permit free rolling of the balls 64 in the ball races 56 and 60, the ball races 56 and 60 extend unblocked over an axial length of the midsection wall 50 and the annular members 22 and 24 beyond both the stops 74 and the stop rings 76, as measured with the piston sleeves 34 and 36 positioned with the piston head portion 40 of the first piston sleeve engaging the second end wall 16, by at least one half of the distance of the end to end axial travel of the piston sleeves within the chamber 32. The actuator 10 is further provided with a camming link 82 positioned within a circumferentially extending, outwardly facing opening 84 in the first annular member 22. The camming link extends between one end wall 86 of the opening 84 and a pin 88 fixedly attached to the second annular member 24 and projecting into the opening. The pin 88 fits into a recess 89 formed in the one end of the camming link 82 and helps maintain the camming link in place within the opening 84. The camming link 82 is angularly oriented, as best shown in Figure 2, for selectively rotating the first annular member 22 relative to the second annular member 24 by a preselected amount upon turning of a link set screw 90. The link set screw 90 is threadably attached to the first annular member and projects into the opening 84 and engages a side of the camming link 82. In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the actuator 10 will be provided with several camming links 80 circumferentially spaced about the annular member 22. Turning of the set screw 90 to extend the set screw further into the opening 84 and press against the camming link 82 applies oppositely directed rotational forces against the end wall 86 of the opening 84 and the pin 88 to rotate the annular members 22 and 24 in opposite directions by a selected amount. This rotation moves the first piston sleeve 34 relative to the second piston sleeve 36 to axially preload the first and second piston sleeves for substantially eliminating backlash as the piston sleeves move from one axial direction to the other in response to selective application of fluid pressure to the compartments 42 and 44. The backlash results from the slack or free movement between the torque transmitting parts.The slack is usually due to the sizing of the ball races and the balls 64 positioned therein, which transmit torque between the piston sleeves 34 and 36 and both the body 12 and the annular members 22 and 24. The relative circumferential positions of the end wall 86 and the pin 88 between which the camming link extends are selected such that the oppositely directed rotation of the annular members 22 and 24 produced by inward adjustment of the set screw 90 causes the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 to move toward each other. By inward adjustment of the set screw 90, the first annular member 22 is rotated relative to the second annular member 24 and carries the balls 64 in the ball race 60 formed on the first annular member into firm seated contact with the ball race 62 formed on the radially outward facing wall of the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34 to eliminate all slack therebetween.The continued inward adjustment of the set screw 90 rotates the first annular member 22 and transmits the rotation through the first piston sleeve 34. The ball race 58 on the radially inward facing wall of the sleeve portion 38 of the first piston sleeve 34 carries the balls 64 therein into firm seated contact with the ball race 56 formed on the midsection wall 50 to eliminate all slack therebetween.The continued inward adjustment of the set screw 90 causes the axial movement of the first piston sleeve 34 in the direction toward the second end wall 16. At the same time the above described action occurs and assuming the second annular member 24 is free to rotate, the inward adjustment of the set screw 90 causes rotation of the second annular member relative to the first annular member 22 in the opposite rotational direction and carries the balls 64 in the ball race 60 formed on the second annular member into firm seated contact with the ball race 62 formed on the radially outward facing wall of the sleeve portion 38 of the second piston sleeve 36 to eliminate all slack therebetween. The continued inward adjustment of the set screw 90 rotates the second annular member 24 and transmits the rotation through the second piston sleeve 36.The ball race 58 on the radially inward facing wall of the sleeve portion 38 of the second piston sleeve 36 carries the ball 64 therein into firm seated contact with the ball race 56 formed on the midsection wall 50 to eliminate all slack therebetween. The continued inward adjustment of the set screw 90 causes axial movement of the second piston sleeve 36 in the direction toward the first end wall 14 until the sleeve portions 38 of the piston sleeves 34 and 36 are in engagement and all slack has been removed from all ball races with the desired axial loading on the piston sleeves 34 and 36 achieved. The link set screw 90 is then left in the position at which all slack has been eliminated, and the relative rotational positions of the first and second annular members 22 and 24 are thereby locked and maintained during usage of the actuator 10.The same adjustment can be accomplished by holding one of the annular members 22 or 24 stationary and allowing the other to rotate in response to inward adjustment of the set screw. Upon application of fluid pressure to one of the fluid tight compartments 42 and 44 during fluid powered operation of the actuator 10, the piston sleeves 34 and 36 move in unison, as do the annular members 22 and 2 4, with substantially all backlash eliminated as the piston sleeves reciprocate within the chamber 32. Should usage of the actuator 10 cause wear of the ball races or the balls therein, or should slack occur for any other reason, the slack can be easily removed in the same manner described above by further adjustment of the set screw 90. With the present invention, the ball races may be machined using conventional machining techniques with standard tolerances, and the slack which creates the backlash problem can be eliminated by adjustment prior to fluid powered operation of the actuator 10. Furthermore, the ball races can be machined with a size to permit easy assembly of the actuator and any slack thereby introduced can be eliminated by adjustment. In the embodiment of the invention shown inFigure 1, the first annular member 22 has an attachment rim 92 extending radially outward beyond the exterior sidewall 18 of the body 12. The attachment rim 92 has a plurality of bore holes 94 therethrough for attachment of an external device not shown . TXe peripheral shape of the annular member 22 may be varied depending on the method of attachment needed, and as such may be square, semi circular or of any other shape, or may be formed with a right angle attach mont bracket. It is to be understood that the invention may be practiced with the annular member 22 rotatably driving the external device, or with the annular member being held stationary and the rotational drive being provided by the rotation of the body 12.Threaded recesses 96 are provided in the first end wall 14 for attachment of the body 12 to a stationary support frame not shown or to the external device. It is to be understood that while the embodiment of the invention in Figure 1 is shown and described using annular members 22 and 24 extending radially outward beyond the exterior sidewall 18, a similar actuator 10 can be constructed in which the annular members are positioned between the interior sidewall sections 46 and 48 and extend into a central axial opening in the body 12 through which the external device extends and is connected to the first annular member. With this actuator arrangement, the midsection wall 50 is positioned between the support arms 18a and 18b.It is to be further understood that while the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 1, as well as all of the embodiments of the invention which will be described hereinafter, show a particular form of torque transmission means, such as ball races with balls, splines or threaded members with roller screw bearings, the present invention can be used to eliminate the slack fund with any of these or other torque transmitting means. By the use of ball and roller screws the radial load handling character istics of the actuator 10 are significantly insreaaed since, unlike splines, the balls and roller screws provide significant support against radial loading in a44ition to the transmission of torque. A second alternative embodiment of the tion is shown in Figure 3. In this embodiment, the ct ator 10 includes an elongated body 312 having a cylindrical sidewall 314 and first and second end walls 32Q and 322.The body 312 is constructed of first and second cylindrical assemblies 316 and 318, respectively, each having an open end and a closed end. The body half assemblies 316 and 318 are rigidly secured together by their open ends, with an annular mid section wall 324 positioned therebetween, by a plurality of elongated, circumferentially spaced fasteners 326. The fasteners 326 are positioned in bore holes extending between the half assembl ies 316 and 318 through the mid section wall 324. The circumferential spacing of the fasteners 326 is shown in Figure 4. A rotary shaft 328 is coaxially positioned within the body 312 and supported for rotation relative to the body by axial thrust bearings 330 positioned in corresponding ball races 332 formed on the shaft 328 and the end walls 320 and 322. The shaft 328 extends through an aperture 334 in each of the end walls 320 and 322 and projects therebeyond for connection to an external device not shown by keys 336. The second body half assembly 318 has at its axially outward end a rectangular flange 338 by which the actuator 10 is connected to a stationary support not shown . A port 340 extends radially through each of the end walls 320 and 322 and communicates with the aperture 334 therein. Conventional seals 342 are provided between the end walls 320 and 322 and the shaft 328, located axially outward of the ports 340, to provide a fluid tight chamber 344 within the body 312. A first sleeve 346 is coaxially and reciprocally mounted within the .chamber 344 of the body 312 about the shaft 328 toward the first end wall 320, and a second sleeve 348 is coaxially and reciprocally mounted within the chamber about the shaft toward the second end wall 322. positioned between the first and second sleeves 346 and 348 are first and second annular pistons 350 and 352, respec tively. The pistons 350 and 352 are coaxially and reciprocally mounted within the chamber 344 about the shaft 328, with the axially outward facing end wall of the first piston slidably engaging the corresponding end wall of the first sleeve 346 and the axially outward facing end wall of the second piston slidably engaging the corresponding end wall of the second sleeve 348. Positioned between the pistons 350 and 352 is an elastomeric ring. As will be described in more detail below, the elastomeric ring 354 provides an axially outward force on each of the sleeves 346 and 348 to provide automatic axial preloading of the sleeves to eliminate backlash. The elastomeric ring 354 extends radially inward and outward beyond the radial sidewalls of the pistons 350 and 352 to provide fluid tight seals between the pistons and a smooth wall portion of the shaft 328 and a smooth interior wall portion of the mid section wall 324 to define a fluid tight compartment to each axially outward side of the pistons. The shaft 328 has a pair of helical ball races 356 formed thereon, to each side of the smooth wall portion of the shaft, each confronting and corresponding to a helical ball race 358 formed on the radially inward facing wall of each of the sleeves 346 and 348. The ball races 356 and 358 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined, variable length, inner ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the corresponding ball races. The radially inward facing wall of the sidewall 314 of each body half assembly 316 and 318 has a helical ball race 360 formed thereon confronting and corresponding to a ball race 362 formed on the radially outward facing wall of each of the piston sleeves 346 and 348. The ball races 360 and 362 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined, variable length outer ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the corresponding ball races. A plurality of balls 364 are disposed in each of the inner and outer channels for transmission of torque between the first sleeve 346 and the shaft 328, between the first sleeve and the sidewall 314 of the first half assembly 316, between the second sleeve 348 and the shaft, and between the second sleeve and the sidewall of the second half assembly 318. As previously described for other embodiments, the blocked ends of the ball races and the axially outward facing end walls of the pistons 350 and 352 serve as stops to engage and limit the travel of the balls 364 and to regroup the balls. As with the embodiment shown in Figure 3, the ball races 358 and 362 of the sleeves 346 and 348 have their axially outward ends terminating in a blocked end and their axially inward ends open and running out into the interior chamber 344 of the body 312. As the pistons 350 and 352 linearly reciprocate between one or the other axial directions within the chamber 344 upon the selective application of hydraulic fluid or forced air to the ports 340, torque is transmitted by the balls 364 through the coaction of the ball races 362 on the sleeves 346 and 348 with the ball races 360 on the sidewall 314. The transmitted torque causes the sleeves 346 and 348 to rotate as they move axially. The resulting linear and rotational movement of the sleeves 346 and 348 is transmitted by the balls 364 through the coaction of the ball races 358 on the sleeves with the ball races 356 on the shaft 328. The transmitted torque causes the shaft 328 to rotate relative to the body 312 since axial movement of the shaft is restricted by the thrust bearings 330. With the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 3, no operator adjustment is required to eliminate backlash. This is particularly useful for actuators having a small size or construction which makes the use of internal adjustment components and external access ports impractical. With this embodiment, the axial thickness of the elastomeric ring 354 is selected such that it will be placed in a compressed state when in position between the pistons 350 and 352 when the half assemblies 316 and 318 of the body 12 are secured together using the fasteners 326. It is noted that the fasteners 326 only place the elasto meric ring 354 in a compressed state, and do not serve any further adjustment purpose. The elastomeric ring 354 is selected to have sufficient resiliency to exert an axially outward force on the sleeves 346 and 348 when in the compressed state to move the sleeves axially outward relative to each other for preloading of the sleeves to eliminate backlash. The elastomeric ring 354 is also selected with a stiffness or resiliency sufficient to exert an axially outward force at least as great as the axially inward force being exerted by the pistons 350 and 352 on the elastomeric ring during normal fluid powered operation of the actuator 10. As such, the preloading of the sleeves 346 and 348 is automatic and is maintained during operation, even if components should wear. For ease of explanation, the automatic elimination of slack will first be described assuming the inside and outside channels exhibit the same degree of slack. The elastomeric ring 354 applies an equal and oppositely directed axially outward force to each of the sleeves 346 and 348. The outward force moves the first sleeve 346 axially toward the first end wall 320 and carries the balls 364 in the ball race 358 formed on the first sleeve into firm seated contact with the corresponding ball races 356 formed on the shaft 328 to eliminate all slack therebetween.Simultaneously, the axially movement of the first sleeve 346 carries the balls 364 in the ball race 362 formed on the first sleeve into firm seated contact with the ball race 360 formed on the sidewall 314 of the first halfassembly 316 to eliminate all slack therebetween. The outward force also moves the sleeve 348 axially toward the second end wall 322 and carries the balls 364 in the ball races 358 formed on the second sleeve into firm seated contact with the corresponding ball race 356 on the shaft 328 to eliminate all slack therebetween.Simultaneously, the axial movement of the second sleeve 348 carries the balls 364 in the ball race 362 formed on the second sleeve into firm seated contact with the ball race 360 formed on the sidewall 314 of the second half assembly 318 to eliminate all slack therebetween. Should the slack in one of the outer or inner chars is exceed the slack in the other, the axially outward force exerted by the elastomatic ring 354 on the sleeves 346 and 348 after the slack has been completely eliminated from the channel with the lesser slack, will cause the sleeves to rotate in opposite directions and move axially apart until the excess slack is eliminated. Since the sleeves 346 and 348 are free to rotate relative to each other when the channel with the lesser slack has all slack removed, the channel will cause the rotation of the sleeves in opposite rotational directions in response to the axially outward force still being applied by the elastomeric ring.The rotation will continue and produce axial separation of the sleeves 346 and 348 until the balls of the ball races of the sleeves forming the channel with the excess slack are carried into firm seated contact with the corresponding ball races forming the channel. It is noted that while the sleeves 346 and 348 rotate to adjust for the excess slack in the one channel, the opposite rotation of the sleeves produce no rotation of the shaft 328, since the elastomeric member 354 applies an equal and opposite force on each of the sleeves and the force each sleeve tends to apply to the shaft is of equal magnitude and of opposite rotational direction. At such time that the sleeves 346 and 348 will have rOtated sufficiently upart to produce enough 22 xxi al separation to eliminate all slack in the torque transmitting members and a steady state will be reached and all backlash eliminated. So long as the axially inward force applied to the pistons 350 and 352 by the fluid pressure during operation is not so great as to overcome the axially outward force of the elastomeric ring 354 necessary to maintain the sleeves 346 and 348 in their separated state with all slack eliminated, the actuator 10 will operate without backlash.Should usage of the actuator 10 cause wear of the ball races or the balls therein, or should slack occur for any other reason, the slack will be auto matically eliminated by the elastomeric ring 354 so long as the ring has sufficient additional resiliency to compensate for the wear. Although the emobodiment of the invention shown in figure 3 has been described using an elastomeric ring 354, the invention may be practiced using any other suitable resilient member, such as a Belleville washer, or one or more springs. A third alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 5. In this embodiment, the actuator 10 includes an elongated body 412 having a cylindrical sidewall 414, and first and second ends 418 and 420, respectively. A rotary shaft 416 is coaxially positioned within the body 412 and supported for rotation relative to the body.The shaft 416 has a radially outward extending flange portion 422 positioned toward the second end 420 and rotatably held in place therein against inward thrust by a thrust bearing 424. The thrust bearing 424 is disposed in circumferential ball race 426 formed on the sidewall 414 toward the second end 420, and a corresponding ball race 428 formed on the axially outward facing wall of the flange portion 422. A threaded cap 430 is positioned at the first end 418 of the body 412 and has a central aperture 432 therein.The cap 4 30 has a collar 433 positioned about the shaft 416 and extending axially inward. Threadedly attached to the shaft 416 toward the first end 418 is a circular nut 434.The nut 434 is positioned in the aperture 432 of the cap 430 and supported therein by a thrust bearing 436 positioned between the nut and the cap. The trust bearing 436 is disposed in a circumferential ball race 438 formed on the radially inward facing wall of the cap 430 about the aperture 432, and a corresponding ball race 440 formed on the nut 430. The nut 434 is adjustable on the shaft 416 for axial loading of the thrust bearings 424 and 436. The shaft 416 is adapted for coupling to an external device not shown and the body 412 is adapted for attachment to a stationary support frame not shown . A piston sleeve 442 is coaxially and reciprocally mounted within the body 412 about the shaft 416. The piston sleeve 442 has a head portion 444 positioned toward the first end 418 of the body 412 with the collar 433 disposed between the head portion and the shaft, and a sleeve portion 446 extending axially inward therefrom. The head portion 444 carries conventional inner and outer seals 448 disposed between the head portion and corresponding smooth wall portions of the collar 433 and the sidewall 414 to define fluid tight compartments to each side of the head portion. An annular sleeve 450 is coaxially and reciprocally mounted within the body 412 about the shaft 416 toward the second end 420 of the body. Positioned between the axially inward facing wall of the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 442 and the axially inward facing wall of the sleeve 450 is a bearing ring 452. The sleeve portion 446 and the sleeve 450 are independently rotatable within at least a limited range for backlash adjustment purposes, and are in slidable engagement with each other through the bearing ring 452. A helical ball race 454 is formed on the shaft 416 confronting and corresponding to a pair of helical ball races 456 formed on the radially inwardly facing wall of each of the sleeve portion 446 and the sleeve 450. The ball races 454 and 456 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined, variable length inner ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the corresponding ball races. The sidewall 414 has a helical ball race 458 formed thereon confronting and corresponding to a pair of ball races 460 formed on the radially outward facing wall of each of the sleeve portion 446 and the sleeve 450. The ball races 458 and 460 have substantially identical lead and pitch, and form a pair of laterally confined variable length outer ball channels defined by the area of coincidence of the corresponding ball races. A plurality of balls 462 are disposed in each of the inner and outer channels for transmission of torque between the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 444 and the shaft 416, between the sleeve portion and the sidewall 414, between the sleeve 450 and the shaft, and between the sleeve and the sidewall. The bearing ring 452 serves as a ball stop, as do certain of the blocked ends of the ball races in the manner previously described, to engage and limit travel of balls 462 and to regroup the balls. As with the previous embodiments, the dashed lines on Figure 7 indicate the extent of the ball races. The bearing ring 452, in addition to another function that will be described below, serves to prevent the balls 462 from passing out of the open ball race ends and into another open end. As the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 linearly reciprocate between one or the other axial directions within the body 412, torque is transmitted by the balls 462 through the coaction of the ball race 458 on the sidewall 414 with the ball race 460 on the sleeve portion 446 and the sleeve 450. The transmitted torque causes the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 to rotate as they move axially. The resulting linear and rotational movement of the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 is transmitted by the balls 462 through the coaction of the ball races 456 on the sleeve portion 446 and the sleeve 450 with the ball races 454 on the shaft 416. The transmitted torque causes the shaft 416 to rotate relative to the body 412 since axial movement of the shaft is restricted by the thrust bearings 424 and 436. The actuator 10 is further provided with an axially extendable set screw 464 threadably received in a threaded axial bore 466 extending through the sleeve 450.The set screw 464 is inwardly adjustable to project from the sleeve 450 and engage the bearing plate 452 and therethrough apply an adjustable and oppositely directed axially outward force on each of the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450. The force moves the piston sleeve 442 relative to the sleeve 450 for axially preloading the piston sleeve and the sleeve. An access port 468 is provided in the flange portion 422 of the shaft 416 for access to the set screw 464 for its adjustment without disassembling the piston sleeve 442 or the sleeve 450 from the body 412. The access port 468 is closed with a threaded cap 470 when not in use to prevent the leakage of fluid therefrom. In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the actuator 10 will be provided with several set screws 464 circumferentially spaced about the sleeve 450 in a balanced arrangement. In operation, the inward adjustment of the set screw 464 to apply axially outward directed force on the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 operates to eliminate the slack between the ball races in much the same manner as previously described for the elastomeric ring in the embodiment shown in Figure 3. That is, the inward adjustment of the set screw 464 first causes axial separation of the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 to eliminate slack in the inner and outer channels. If the slack in one of the channels exceeds the slack in the other, the continued inward adjustment of the set screw 464 after the slack has been completely eliminated from the channel with the lesser slack, will produce opposite rotation of the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 and move them axially apart until the excess slack is eliminated. In this embodiment of the invention, the actuator 10 is not limited to the amount of fluid pressure that can be applied to the piston sleeve 442 during fluid powered operation once all backlash has been eliminated to maintain the proper adjustment, as is the case when the elastomeric ring 354 or another resilient member is used for the automatic adjustment to eliminate backlash See Figure 3 . A fourth alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 6, similar in construction to the embodiment shown in Figure 5 except as will be hereinafter described. For ease of understanding, the components of the sixth embodiment have been similarly numbered with those of Figure 5. In the fourth embodiment, the cap 430 is eliminated, and the shaft thrust bearing 436 is positioned between the nut 434 and. the sidewall 414, with the ball race 438 being formed on the sidewall. In the sixth embodiment, the torque transmitting ball races and balls have been replaced with corresponding screw threads 472 formed on the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 442, the sleeve 450, the shaft 416 and the sidewall 414 and with roller screws 474 and 476 positioned therebetween. While a single roller screw is shown, a plurality of roller screws are used circumferentially positioned one adjacent the next, and in parallel arrangement. To eliminate axial travel of the roller screws 474 and 476, stops 478 are formed on the sidewall 414, the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 located at the end of the roller screws. In the fourth embodiment of the invention, the bearing ring 452 has been eliminated and the set screw 464 bears directly on the axially inward facing end wall of the sleeve portion 446 of the piston sleeve 442. As before described, the piston sleeve 442 and the sleeve 450 are independently rotatable and the set screw 446 slidably engages the sleeve portion 446. A fifth alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 7, and similar in construction to the embodiments of Figures 5 and 6 and carrying the same reference numerals except as necessary to indicate the differences in structure. In the embodiment of Figure 7, one of the fluid port 447 passes through the cap 430, rather than the sidewall 414. Furthermore, a second shaft nut 480 is provided axially outward of the first nut 434 and is attachable to the first nut using fasteners 482 to lock it in place relative to the first nut. As with the embodiment of the invention in Figure 6, roller screws are used seated in correspondingly threaded portions of the sidewall 414, the sleeve portion 446, the sleeve 450 and the shaft 416. The inner roller screw has, however, been replaced with two roller screws 476a and 476b which transmit torque between the piston sleeve 442 and the shaft 416 and between the sleeve 450 and the shaft, respectively. A sixth alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 8 of similar construction to the embodiment of Figures 5 7 and similarly numbered. In the sixth embodiment the flange portion 422 of the shaft 416 is positioned axially outward of the second end 420 of the body 412 and extends radially outward therebeyond. The thrust bearing 424 is a roller bearing positioned between the end wall of the body 412 at the second end 420 and a race formed in the axially inward facing wall of the flange portion 422. The thrust bearing 436 at the first end 418 is positioned between the nut 434 and an end wall 484 of the body 412. The shaft 412 extends through a central aperture 486 in the end wall 484. An outwardly extending circumferential flange 488 is fixedly attached to the body 412 and has a plurality of bore holes 490 extending therethrough for attachment to a support frame or an external device not shown . It will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except by the appended claims.
