# A vehicle hydraulic braking system.

## Abstract
A pair of tandem master cylinders 1, 2 have primary pressure spaces 18 connected to the brakes on one pair of wheels on opposite sides of the vehicle, and an actuator 60 for the brakes on a trailer is supplied with fluid under pressure from pipe lines connected to each of the four pressure spaces 18, 20 and under the control of first and second disabler valves 61, 62 . Each disabler valve 61, 62 has a pair of inlet ports 71, 72 , each connected either to respective primary pressure spaces or respective secondary pressure spaces, and an outlet port 73 connected to the actuator 60 . When one master cylinder is operated on its own both disabler valves are closed to prevent the actuator 60 from being operated. Failure of one pressure space, when both master cylinders are operated simultaneously, causes the corres ponding disabler valve to close but the actuator 60 can still be operated from the operative pressure spaces, through the other disabler valve.
