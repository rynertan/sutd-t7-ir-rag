# A method, broaching tool and broaching machine, for forming scroll members for scroll type apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for forming a scroll member of scroll type apparatus, the scroll member comprising an end plate having an involute wrap rigidly affixed thereto. In one embodiment, the end plate 27 and involute wrap 12 are precision formed, e.g., by casting, as an integral element. Then, reentrant corners 39, 40 are formed be tween the inner and outer flank surfaces 30, 31 of the turns 25, 26 of the involute wrap 12 at their juncture with the end plate 27 . The inner and outer flank surfaces 30, 31 are then broached to the desired dimensional accuracy and finish. Push broaching is accomplished with an involute broaching tool which has a single terminating cutting edge 46 on one side of an involute blade cutter.
