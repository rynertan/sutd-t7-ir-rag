# Continuously variable transmission oil pressure control.

## Abstract
A control system for a continuously variable transmission has a spool valve 40 for controlling the line pressure of oil supplied to a cylinder of a driven pulley to change the line pressure. The line pressure control valve has chambers at each end of the spool. A spring 43 is provided between one end of the spool and a slidable spring housing 44 so as to assist movement of the spool in one direction. The pressure of oil supplied to the end of the spool is controlled in accordance with engine operating conditions and the position of the spr ing housing is adjusted in accordance with the transmission ratio so as to control the spring pressure.
