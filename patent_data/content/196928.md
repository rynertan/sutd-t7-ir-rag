# PRODUCTION OF BRUSHES

## Abstract
A method of making rotary driven brushes, particularly road sweeping brushes, by arranging bunches of bristles 2 so that their one ends 2a extend into a mould 3 for forming the brush base 1 , and applying into the mould 3 around the ends 2a of the bristles a quick setting liquid plastics material, generally a micro cellular elastomeric polymer material such as polyurethane foamed by adding water thereto, and allowing the plastics material to set to secure the brush base to the bristles.
