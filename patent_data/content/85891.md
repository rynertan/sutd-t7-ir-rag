# A composition for the cleaning and hygien of teeth.

## Abstract
Non irritating and non abrasive water soluble salts like sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, etc , are suspended in anhydrous 1,2,3 propanetriol, giving place to a paste which, upon being distributed onto a moistened toothbrush, forms a hypertonic and supersaturated solution, with suspended crystals, by which the teeth are cleaned, and owing to the hypertonicity causes a flow of fluids from the gingival pockets towards the oral cavity. By the addition of an antispetic compound, the compo sion can also be useful as a mouth rinsing preparation.

## Description
The present invention relates to a toothpaste based on water soluble and non abrasive substances which are suspended in an excipient 1,2,3 propanetriol which with said substances gives place to a pleasant flavoured paste.According to the today concepts, the ideal toothpaste is a powder of sodium bicarbonate containing 1 of sodium chloride and 1 of stannous fluoride.This excellent combination based on non irritating substances gives place to a salty taste not always agreeable and difficult to be distributed onto the toothbrush.The commercially available toothpastes are formulated with non water soluble chemical substances in which the cation is an earth alkaline metal, as Ca and MgCalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium phosphate and magnesium carbonate are the most commonly used substances owing to their abrasive capacity in formulating pastes for tooth cleaning.These substances, which are often micronized to improve the paste homogeneity, are dispersed into excipients which are usually aqueous or comprising water and glycerine or water and alcohol.These dispersed particles, which are loaded with the bacterial deposits they have removed, adhere to the mucous membranes of the mouth and are removed in not controlled but certainly long times.In the Italian Patent No. 1,044,821 a non abrasive toothpaste is disclosed, consisting of a mixture of substances which are all water soluble and which dissolve in water upon use.The thus resulting toothpaste, provided either as a gel or as a powder or a micronulate, is active in the presence of even little amounts of water by which the toothbrush must previuosly be wet or moistened.The gel and granules can be used separately. However the powdered or granulated toothpastes formed either of non soluble or of soluble salts as sodium bicarbonate, are not too much used.The substitution of a common toothpaste with another one, by which granules are to be added to a gel, is even more difficult.The English patent No. 1,413,642 relates to a toothpaste in which the cleaning or abrasive components comprise in addition to sodium bicarbonate, other non watersoluble sustances, such as micronized silica, aluminium, zirconium silicate, calcium carbonate in an amount from 5 to 25 by weight .Mixtures of water and 1,2,3 propanetriol are used as the vehicle of the composition, this vehicle being in any case an usual ingredient of toothpastes.It is an object of the present invention to allow, by only one application of the suspension, as contained in a common tube made of plastics or aluminium, onto the wet or moistened toothbrush, to use for cleaning water soluble, little abrasive salts.The present invention uses for this purpose water soluble substances, such as sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, sodium tartrate, sodium salicylate, magnesium chloride, zinc chloride, strontium acetate and all of the water soluble substances but not soluble into the trivalent 1,2,3 propanetriol.This trivalent alcohol is devoided of any toxicity and has been proposed as a food component in substitution for carbohydrates in 1929 by Ferma et al., and in 1933 byJohanson et al.By 50 solution of 1,2,3 propanetriol, either intravenously injected and orally administered, the cerebral oedema can be reduced G.P. Cantore at al 1965 M.M.L.Campan et al, 1965 M. Virno et al 1962 .The present invention contains the soluble and non abrasive salts, suspended in pure 1,2,3 propanetriol, recommended by the odontological pharmacopeas.The suspension upon being distributed onto a moistaned toothbrush of suitable size, gives place to a supersaturated solution in 1,2,3 propanetriol which on the one hand allows an effective cleaning being carried out, and on the other hand a flow of liquids, causes from the gingival pockets and through the epithelium of the mucous membranes affected by any inflammatory processes, to take place from the oedematous interstices to the hypertonic solution which is present in the oral cavity.The 1,2,3 propanetriol does not have any action on the normal mucous membrane, and it is known M. Amorosa 1978 that the caustic effect of some compounds c.g. phenol will be lower if it is in a glyceric solution.The solvent suspended salts are deprived from any abrasive capacity.The alcohol and the salts are water soluble so that they do not leave, upon simply rinsing the mouth, any residue on the mocous membranes.Due to these properties, the toothpaste composition of this invention, upon addition of an antispetic and or of an antiinflammatory agent at a suitable concentration, can be used as a collutory which, if kept into the oraicavity for 2 3 minutes,canUe r 3tq ihe germs which have been separated from the dental plaque during the preceding operations.Preferably the antiseptic agent is soluble both in water and in 1,2,3, propanetriol.As it concerns the components of the composition of the present invention, they substantially include surfactonts, salts, sweeteners and possibly antispetics.As surfactant agents, all the synthetic cationic or anionic surfactants and the soaps produced by hydrolysis and subsequent salification of fatty acids deriving from the natural fats can be used.Among the antiseptic agents, compounds such as 8 hydroxyquinoline pyrrolidoncarboxylate, quinosole, benzetonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium chlorohexidine acetate, gluconate., pyrrolidone carboxylate and so on are provided.As it concerns the anti inflammatory agent, use of 1 p chlorobenzoyl 5 metoxy 2methyl indol 3 acetic acid or of acetyl salicylic acid is preferred.As far as sweeteners are concerned, all of the synthetic and natural sweeteners without cariogenic capacity are useful.In the end among the salts the water soluble ones are useful such as sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, strontium acetate, zinc chloride, strontium pyrroli don carboxylate.All of the above mentioned components are deprived of any abrasive capacity and accordingly no scratching the tooth enamel takes place and in addition, all of them being water soluble, no solide residue remains within the pockets.The following specific examples of the compositions of the invention are intended to illustrate the invention without any limiting purpose.

A peculiar aspect of the composition according to the invention is that use of this composition, as compared with the known toothpastes, affords a better 5 S 9n the dental plaque without traces of any scraping off or damage of the tooth surface. The toothpaste forming object of this invention affords not negligible improvements of the oral hygiene since the excipient and the substances suspended therein are water soluble and do not accordingly leave any suspended non soluble particle adhering to the gums and to the other mucous membranes of the oral cavity it is non abrasive it gives place to an antiinflammatory and antiodemigenic effect it contains antispetic substances which upon dissolution in the maximum amount of water which may be reatined in the oral cavivity have a sufficient concentration to reduce within one to two minute the cariogenic bacterial flora it can act as a toothpaste and as a collutory under dentist prescription.
