# A compensating exhaust hood.

## Abstract
A backshelf compensating exhaust hood 1 includes an upper wall passageway 18 for forming and redirecting an induction air stream into and through an exhaust chamber 7 to an exhaust passageway 9 , the upper wall pas sageway 18 extends through the upper wall to a smooth curved reverse passageway 19 redirects the air into a short slot 20 which discharges a stream 14 into the upper end of the exhaust chamber 7 . A forward tilted filter 15 is located in the exhaust chamber 7 to form the back wall of the exhaust chamber 7 and with the lower end spaced inwardly of the upper end and with the upper portion aligned with the induction air stream 14 . The filter 15 is oriented to define an essentially right angle with the interior upper wall of the exhaust chamber 7 . The top wall 21 of the exhaust chamber 7 extends inwardly and upwardly slightly to the filter 15 . The induction air supply passageway 18 is a relatively large passageway which has a depth which is a multiple of the depth of the slot 20 . The inlet expands slightly to the deflector and reverse passageway 19 to the discharge slot 20 . The discharge slot 20 includes a short extension of the deflector wall as an essentially flat wall 29 which extends parallel to the top wall 21 of the exhaust chamber 7 . For a gas fired unit, an exhaust duct 35 is located to the backside 5 of the hood 1 for upwardly spaced alignment with flue duct of the equipment. The spaced exhaust duct 35 of the hood 1 projects upwardly into the exhaust passageway 9 for exhausting of the com bustion gases and secondary air introduced between the flue duct and the exhaust duct.
