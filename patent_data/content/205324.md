# Pseudo vertical synchronizing signal producing circuit.

## Abstract
A pseudo vertical synchronizing signal producing circuit produces a pseudo vertical synchronizing signal which is used instead of a regular vertical synchronizing signal of a video signal during a special reproduction mode of a helical scan type magnetic recording and or reproducing apparatus. The pseudo vertical synchronizing signal producing circuit effectively utilizes a counter circuit 37, 38, 40, 44, 45, 47, 53 for producing a pulse when a counted value therein reaches predetermined threshold values set therein, and employs a minimum number of monostable multivibrators and external variable resistors coupled thereto, so that the circuit can easily be manufactured in the form of an integrated circuit.
