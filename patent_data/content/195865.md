## Description
The invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit card electronic insertion device. An IC card electronic insertion device provides equipment in which information can be electrically transferred between the circuitry on the electronic equipment and the IC circuit in the card by inserting an IC card having the desired functions programs or data into a card slot in the device. Such equipment is common in personal computers, hand held computers, TV games machines and other electronic equipment. Such equipment is shown in Figures 1, 2 and 4 of the drawings. An IC card consists of a compact, thin inflexible card body 31 usually measuring about 85.6 mm long, 54 mm wide, and 0.8 2.0 mm thick, in which an IC integrated circuit chip 32 having desired functions is built into a rigid or semi rigid card body made of plastics or reinforced cardboard. Circuit terminals 33 are arranged along a leading edge on the surface of the card. On an IC card of the prior art, an IC chip 32 is built into the card by inserting a printed circuit board PCB 35 with the IC chip 32 into a rectangular hollow 34 positioned near the card edge on the surface of the body 1, with the chip side toward the hollow 34, and by fixing the PCB with adhesive. Metal printed terminals 33, which are arranged along the board edge corresponding to the card edge on the board surface opposite to the IC chip mounting surface, are connected to the chip 32 via corresponding printed wires 36 through holes. The IC card can be inserted into a card slot 11 on the electronic equipment A, with the card edge having the terminals 33 oriented toward the card slot and with the card s front face in this example, the surface on which the terminals 33 are arranged oriented as shown in Figure 2 towards you, until the card edge bottoms against the insertion end 13 on a connector 12. The terminals 33 are then in full contact with corresponding springy terminals 14 in the device, so that the IC circuit on the card B is electrically connected to the control circuit not shown in the figure on the electronic equipment to allow information to be transferred between them. The connector 12 is a plastic injection moulded product in which spring terminals 14 are moulded at predetermined positions and intervals corresponding to the terminals 33 on the card. Guide rails 15 having a U shaped cross section are arranged in parallel and in opposition to each other at the left and right sides of the connector. The left and right edges of the card are inserted into the grooves 15a 15a in the left and right guide rails 15 15 so that the card is smoothly guided. Attachment lugs 16,17 for securing the connector 12 to the side plate 18 on the electronic equipment body are provided. When such an IC card is inserted into the card slot 11 on the electronic equipment, the specified card edge and the specified card surface must both be correctly oriented for correct usage. The card can often be inserted by mistake incorrectly oriented. In this case, of course, the IC circuit on the card cannot be connected to the circuit on the electronic equipment in addition, the terminals 14 on the connector 12 and or the edge and surfaces of the card may be damaged. With some types of connectors, a card which has been inserted incorrectly cannot be pulled out, or becomes hard to pull out. If it is forcefully pulled out, the connector terminals or the card may be damaged. An object of the present invention is to prevent incorrect insertion of an IC card which may cause trouble such as damage to the connector terminals. It is known see EP A 0018116 , in connection with a printed circuit card for a data memory, to prevent insertion of the card into the wrong card slot in the memory device or inverted insertion of the card, by providing each card with a slot in its leading edge, which slots co operate with corresponding projections to allow insertion into the correct slot or in the correct orientation. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an IC card for insertion into a card slot of a connector of an electronic insertion device, the connector having means, for co operating with the card, to allow the card to be fully inserted to the insertion end of the connector only when the card is inserted into the card slot in the correct orientation with respect to the connector, the card having If the card is inserted incorrectly, it is stopped from advancing farther than a position where the card edge does not reach the terminals on the connector. This warns the operator of incorrect card insertion, and prevents trouble such as damage to the connector terminals. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a connector for an IC card electronic insertion device having a card slot, and a row of terminals, the connector having means, for co operating with an IC card as defined above, which allows the IC card to be fully inserted to the insertion end of the connector only when the IC card is inserted into the card slot in the correct orientation with respect to the connector and which stops the card from advancing further at a position where the card terminals do not contact the terminals on the connector if the card is inserted in the incorrect orientation, characterised in that Two embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which A is part of the electronic equipment B is an IC card 11 is an insertion slot 12 is a card insertion connector 14 are connector terminals and 33 is a terminal on the card. In figures 1 to 7, the leading fore edge of the IC card B includes a cam face 31a of slanting or arcuate shape. On the connector 12, spring members 19 19 are positioned, which are formed by bending spring plates see Figure 7 . The projections 19a 19a of the spring members 19 19 stand out in the grooves 15a 15a of the left and right guide rails 15 15 at a position between the card slot 11 and the terminal position. When the IC card B is inserted to the card slot 11 on the connector 12 with the card edge in the correct direction and with the card face oriented correctly Fig.5 the cam face 31a on the card edge comes in contact with the projections 19a 19a of the spring members 19 19 in the grooves on the connector 12. When the card is pressed in further, the cam face 31a moves the projections 19a 19a of the spring members 19 19 outward against a spring force produced by the spring member Fig.5 shown by the two dot chain line . This action allows the card B to bottom at the insertion end 13 of the connector 12. If the card B is inserted with the card face oriented incorrectly Fig.6 a or with the card edge in the opposite direction Fig.6 b , the cam face 31a does not come into contact with the projection 19a 19a of the spring members 19 19, so that the projections cannot be moved outward. Therefore, the edge of the inserted card is held by the projections 19a 19a of the spring members 19 19 to prevent the card edge from reaching the terminals on the connector. The spring members 19 19 may be metal or plastic pieces of a shape shown in Figs.7 a 7 c , or may be moulded integrally during injection moulding of the connector. In a second embodiment see Fig.8 , either or both left and right side edges of the card B are bevelled into a wedge shape 22 over a part of their length and the cross section of the groove 15a of the guide rail 15 on the connector 12 is so shaped that the groove 15a accommodates the bevelled side edge of the card B shown by solid line to allow the card s leading edge to reach the insertion end 13 on the connector when the card is inserted correctly, whereas the groove 15a does not accommodate the bevelled side edges of the card B shown by two dot chain line when the card is inserted incorrectly. Only the upper portion of guide rail 15a or the card slot 11 may be so shaped as to accommodate the bevelled side edge of the card B only when the card is inserted correctly.
