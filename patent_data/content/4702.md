# Simulcast transmission system having phase locked remote transmitters.

## Abstract
A simulcast transmission system is provided where a reference signal transmitted from a central station is utilized to phase lock transmitters located at remote stations. Each of the remote stations includes a receiver 102 , a signal conditioner 104 and a transmitter 106, 110 for receiving and conditioning the reference signal and transmitting the conditioned reference signal. Each of the remote station transmitters includes a phase locked loop 106 which may be followed by a transmitter 110 for providing transmitter signals of predetermined frequencies. All the transmitters at the remote stations are phase locked to the reference signal from the central station. The signal conditioner 104, 105 includes circuitry which enables the signal conditioner to detect interruption in the reference signal from the central station, which detected interruptions cause it to operate in an open loop mode to provide the conditioned reference signal during the interruption. The signal conditioner 104, 105 also includes circuitry which enables the signal conditioner to detect clearance of the interruption and automatically phase synchronize the remote station to the reference signal for resuming closed loop operation.
