# Metabolically active preparations obtained from yeast of any type.

## Abstract
A process for obtaining a sterile, apyrogenic product for promoting oxidative phosphorylation and suitable for thera peutic or cosmetic compositions, starting from yeast, in which any type of yeast is subjected to a process of plasmolysis, fol lowed by treatment with proteolytic enzymes and then with di amine oxidase, after which the proteins present in the solution are precipitated by alcohols, the solution pH is stabilised, and the solution concentrated at low temperature under vacuum.
