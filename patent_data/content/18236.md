# Method and apparatus for cleaning hollow fibers.

## Abstract
The removal of manufacturing oils from prepotted, wound bundles of hollow fibers 10 used in dialysis equipment is ra pidly accomplished by subjecting the fiber assembly to centrif ugal forces acting longitudinally of the fibers. Wicking pads 20 may be used at the outer ends of the fibers during the cen trifuging step if desired to counteract the capillary action of the fibers. Following the centrifuging, the fibers are preferably re peatedly immersed, in a vertical direction, in a solvent into which any oil trapped in the pores of the fiber walls dffiuses. The repeated rise and fall of the solvent in the fiber lumen con tinually re introduces fresh solvent into the iumen to leach oil out of the pores at a rapid rate. In a similar manner, moisture can then be removed from the fibers by alternately evacuating the fiber lumens in a vacu um chamber and refilling them with warm, very dry air to rapidly remove any moisture contained in the cellulose of the fibers.
