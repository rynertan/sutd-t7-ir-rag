# Inhibition of carbon accumulation on metal surfaces.

## Abstract
Metal substrate surfaces are protected against carbon accumulation by carbon containing gases by depositing tanta lum and or tungsten or oxides of tantalum and or tungsten on the substrate. The substrate is heated from 600 C to 1200 C for a time sufficient for the tungsten and or tantalum to diffuse into the surface of the substrate.
