# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING FUSED ALUMINA PRODUCTS

## Abstract
This process produces a high purity, low porosity, alpha alumina product containing no more than 0.05 percent by weight soda, which is useful in the production of abrasives, refractories and electrical insulators by fusing Bayer alumina together with small amounts of carbon and high purity titanium dioxide, TiO₂, or zirconium dioxide, ZrO₂.
