# Hydraulic lash adjuster with plunger retainer.

## Abstract
A lash adjuster 100 is disclosed for use in engine valve gear. The adjuster includes a body and a plunger 50 is slidably received in a bore formed in body 40 . A piston 64 is slidably received in the plunger and forms a high pressure chamber 86 within the plunger. A one way valve means 72 is disposed intermediate the piston and plunger for admitting fluid to the chamber for lash adjustment. An annular retaining clip 90 is seated in a locking position in a groove 106 formed in an outer wall 104 of the plunger body. The clip extends radially beyond the end face of the hub bore 48 thereby preventing fall out of the plunger body prior to assembly in the engine valve gear.
