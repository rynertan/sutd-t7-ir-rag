# METHOD OF DETERMINING REFERENCE POSITION OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOT.

## Abstract
In the method, reference surfaces 1a, 1b are formed on a fixed base 1 for an industrial robot having freedom of movement in a plurality of directions. Separate reference positions for the robot wrist proximal portion 5 and the robot wrist distal portion 7 with respect to the fixed base 1 in each of the directions of free movement is determined by means of a body jig 11 positioned and secured to the reference surfaces and to the measuring instruments 14 to 19 respectively attached to predetermined reference posi tions on the body jig 11 . The determined reference position is input to a robot NC apparatus so that the apparatus is informed of the reference position. Also disclosed is an apparatus suitably employed for the above described method.
