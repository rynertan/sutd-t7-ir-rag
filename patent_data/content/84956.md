## Description
ROBOT CONTROL METHOD AND SYSTEM This invention relates to a robot control method and system for controlling a robot in accordance with previously stored data. indicative of taught operations. The rising cost of labor has given rise to a demand for labor saving measures and for improvement in work procedures. Industrial robots have been put into use to meet this demand and have been very successful in doing so. Particularly outstanding results have been achieved in plants having numerous machine tools where industrial robots are used to perform such simple services as changing the workpieces and tools associated with each machine tool, as well as complicated services such as assembling parts The demand for such robots. has grown yearly. Playback type robots are widely employed as industrial robots of the above described type. With such playback type industrial robots, a teaching box teaches the necessary service operations in advance, and the taught data referred to as robot command data hereinafter is stored in memory within a control unit. Whenever a request for a service arrives from a machine tool, a series of the above robot command data is read out of the memory sequentially, and the robot responds by servicing the machine in repeated fashion. The robot command data comprises point information regarding a point at which a service is to be performed, robot operating speed, and service codes which indicate control of the hand at the point and which instruct also the exchange of signals with the machine tool sidle, and the like In general, the teaching operation mentioned above proceeds in the following order. 1 set a memory address at which an item of robot command data is to be stored 2 position the robot at the service point by a jog feed manual feed 3 set the positional information regarding the point, as well as the magnitude of the speed command and 4 set the robot service code. A series of robot operations for a machine tool is taught by repeating the sequence 1 through 4 . Accordinglyr as long as there are no problems with the mechanism or control system of the robot, the robot will be positioned at the predetermined operating speed in accordance with the robot command data each time a service is requested, after which the robot will sequentially and correctly execute such services as workpiece exchange, cleaning of machining scraps and control of the hand. With a robot of the type described, however, there is no assurance that the robot hand will always grip a part or workpiece in precisely the same manner, so that such robots are unsuitable for fitting operations that require accuracy. Problems are also encountered in cases where a part of a designated kind is to be picked parts of up from various kinds in order to be transferred to the robot partner, such as a machine tool. In such cases a part of a similar shape is likely to be picked up by the hand, so that then robot is ill fitted for selecting parts of the same shape. Thus, while a conventional robot is capable of picking up a part with its hand, positioning the part at a predetermined point in accordance with taught data and executing a desired. activity with respect to a partner, there is no assurance that the act vity is being performed in a normal manner. For this reason, the conventional robots are utilized solely for simple activities which do not require accuracy. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a robot control method for actuating a robot hand in accordance with taught data stored in a memory to cause said hand to grip a part and then service a mate with said part in a playback mode, comprising the steps of a teaching an operating state by actuating said robot han din accordance with the taught data and storing in said memory information indicative of a reference state based on an output signal from sensing means for sensing the state of an operation performed by said robot hand, and b monitoring the operating state of said robot hand prevailing in the playback mode by comparing, in the playback mode, an output signal from said sensing means with the information stored in said memory. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a robot control system which includes a robot having a hand and a robot control unit having a memory for storing taught data, the robot control when in use, unit controllingithe robot in accordance with taught data stored in the memory, whereby the robot hand is caused to grip a part and then service a mate with said part, which robot control system comprises sensing means for sensing the state of an operation performed by the hand storage means for storing the magnitude of an output obtained from said sensing means as an operation is performed by the hand in accordance with the taught data when the robot control unit is in an operating state teach mode and comparison means for comparing the magnitude of an output obtained from said sensing means when the in robot control unit is a playback mode, with the output magnitude stored in said storage means thereby to monitor the operating state of the hand. An example of the present invention may provide a robot control method and system capable of monitoring an activity performed by a robot hand, possibly the handling of a part by a robot hand. An example of the present invention may provide a robot control method and system capable of readily sensing whether an activity performed by a robot hand is proceeding normally or abnormally, possibly regardless of the size of a part being grasped by the robot hand. An example of the present invention may provide a robot control method and system capable of assuring that a part grasped by a robot hand will be mounted on or fit in an accompanying part or machine in correct fashion An example of the present invention may provide a method and system for robot control wherein sensing means for sensing the operating state of a robot hand are provided on the hand, on a part or machine accompanying the robot hand, or at a predetermined point in the immediate work area for the purpose of obtaining reference values indicative of the correct operating may be state. Specifically, the robot placed in an operating state teach mode to cause the robot hand to execute an activity, just as in an actual operation, in accordance with taught data, and the magnitude of an output signal from the sensing means obtained in the may be operating state teach mode stored in memory as reference state information. Then, with the robot placed in the playback mode of operation, the magnitude of the sensor output signal obtained at such time may be compared with the reference state information in said memory to monitor the operating state. This makes it possible to readily sense any abnormality in the operating state so that robot activities may proceed safely without any risk of damage to the hand, a or gripped part, a mating part or the robot mate, such as a machine tool. examples of Features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof, and in which Figs. IA and IB are plan and side views, respectively, of an exemplary industrial robot to which the present invention appertains part of Fig. 2 is a schematic view illustrating an embodiment of the present invention part of Fig. 3 is a schematic view illustrating another embodiment of the present invention part of Fig. 4 is a schematic view illustrating a further embodiment of the present invention Fig. 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment for practicing the present invention and Fig. 6 is an explanatory view useful in describing the data stored in a memory in the block diagram of F ig. 5. Referring to Figs. 1A and lB showing an industrial robot to which the present invention may be applied, numeral 1 denotes a mechanical hand for gripping, e.g., a workpiece when, say, it is to be exchanged. A wrist 2, connected at one end to the hand 1, is capable of being swiveled w axis and bent up and down QS axis . The wrist 2 is connected at the other end thereof to an arm 3 which can be freely extended and retracted axis . A casing 4 receiving the arm 3 can be moved vertically 1 axis along rotary shaft PL and rotated about the shaft PL e axis . Numeral 5 denotes a frame, and 6 a teaching box 6 for teaching robot motions .An operaeor s panel 7 is provided for manipulation by the operator, as well as a control unit 8 for storing, in succession, the data taught by the teaching box 6, such as operating positions points , operating speed and the various services, and for controlling the motion of the mechanical hand 1, wrist 2, arm 3 and casing 4 in accordance with the taught da ta. part of Referring now to Fig. 2 showing an embodiment of the present invention, a robot hand 1 is provided with fingers la, Ib at the distal end thereof for gripping a part BT by embracing it from the sides. The hand i is moved through the combination of the wrist 2, arm 3 and casing 4, not shown in Fig. 2 , to which it is connect ed. The part BT in the illustrated embodiment has aT shaped configuration, such as a bolt, the shaft portion whereof is to be fitted by the robot hand into a bore PBN formed in a mate, namely in a part PB.SA and SB denote proximity switches, serving as sensing means, so provided as to oppose each other, Fig. 2 shows the fingers la, lb of the hand 1 gripping the head portion of the part BT, which has been lifted from a work table not shown and shows the shaft portion. of the part BT as it is about to be fit into the bore PBN of the part PB. It will be appreciated that the part By cannot be fit into the bore PBN unless the hand 1 grips the part PB correctly, no matter how precisely the hand 1 is positioned xelative to the partPB upon being driven irr accordance with the taught data For example, if the hand. 1 is tilted even slightly when it grips the part BT, the latter will not fit into the bore PBN. In accordance with the present invention, therefore, means are provided for sensing the operating condition of the hand 1, namely the manner in which the hand grips the part BT in order that a decision can be. made as to whether an abnormality exists. Specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, after the hand grips the part BT, the hand is transported to and positioned at a measurement point and then is positioned at the location of the part PB.The sensing means, namely the proximity switches SA,SB, are provided in an opposing relation at the measurement point, and the hand 1, gripping the partBT, is positioned in such a manner that the part BT is brought into position between the switches SA, SB.Thus, whether the part BT is being gripped askew may be decided based on output signals from the switches SA,SB. Each of the proximity switches SA, SB is so designed that the magnitude cf the output signal produced thereby varies in proportion to the distance from an approaching object Monitoring the magnitude of these output signals will permit the attitude of the part B to be judged. Since the gripping operation performed by the hand 1 is a mechanical operation, the gripping state will differ depending upon the shape of the hand 1 and he shape of the. part BT, making it difficult to decide un iquely defined reference values for tha purpose of sensing the tilted attitude of the part. After a teaching operation is complete, the robot hand is submitted to a trial operation and made to perform an actual fitting activity once in accordance with the taught data, at which time the magnitudes of the output signals produced by the proximity switches SA, SB are stored in memory as information indicative of a reference state, i.e., as reference values. Then, in the execution of actual activities performed subsequently, the stored values serve as a basis of comparison with respect to the outputs obtained from the switches SA, SB at such time. To be more specific, the robot is made to perform an activity in accordance with the taught data while gripping the part BT, whereby output signals of magnitudeswr, , ssr are produced by the proximity switches SA, SB.The magnitudes of these signals are stored in memory as information indicative of a reference state.In an actual succeeding operation, the switches SA, SB produce outputs alpha n, ssn that are compared in magnitude with the values ç ssr in memory When the difference between the compared values is greater than a predetermined value, a decision is rendered to the effect that the gripped part is tilted in excess of an allowable degree of tilt, in response to which the hand 1 is made to forgo the operation of fitting the part BT in the part PB and is commanded to release the part. The hand then grips the next part and repeats the foregoing operations. The measurement point where the proximity switchesSA, SB are situated may be located anywhere along the path over which the hand 1 transfers the part BT from the gripping location to the position of the part PB.There is no need to provide the point at 2 location remote from the transfer path. Further, the measurement performed at the measurement point may be used to judge not only the tilt of a part but also the length, or displacement, of a part. For this purpose, means such as photoelectric sensors may be provided. In cases where it is desired to judge tilt or length based on contact rather than proximity, the sensing means may comprise contact sensors, part of Fig. 3 is a view useful in describing another embodiment of the present invention. Here pressure sensors SC, SD are provided on the respective fingers la, Ib of the hand 1 itself so that no measurement point need be provided.In operation, the sensors SCt SD sense any application of pressure as the hand is actually in the progress of fitting the part BT in the bore PBN of the part PB. As described above in connection with the arrangement of Fig. 2, the hand is made to perform the activity in accordance with the taught data When the robot succeeds in fitting the parts together, the prevailing magnitudes art Er of the output signals produced by the pressure sensors SC, SD at such time are stored in memory as information indicative of a reference state. In an actual succeeding operation, the sensors SC, SD produce outputs a, An that are compared in magnitude with the reference values wrt r in memory.When the difference between the compared values is greater than a predetermined value inclusive of zero , a decision is rendered to the effect that the fitting operation is improper, in response to which the operation is cancelled. For example, if the part BT is gripped at a tilted attitude by the hand 1 in Fig. 3A, the hand will not be able to fit part BT in the bore PBN of part PB.In such a situation, the fingers la, lb of the hand are subjected to a pressure during the fitting operation that is greater than that applied. when the operation proceeds normally, so that one or both of the output signal magnitudes gn ssn Pn from the pressure sensors SC, SD will be larger than the corresponding reference values i t Rr. Thus, comparing the pressure sensor outputs with the reference values renders a decision to the effect that the fitting operation is improper. It will also be seen that the magnitudes of the sensor outputs will exceed the reference values, indicating an abnormal fitting operation, if, for some reason, there is incorrect registration between the position of the hand 1 and the position of the bore PBN in part PB during the fitting work.This will preclude drainage to both the parts and the hand should the conditions for fitting be improper. Note that the arrangement of Fig.3 may be applied not only to the fitting together of parts but also to the loading and unloading of workpieces relative to a chuck provided on a machine tool or other mate. Fig. 4 is useful in describing still another embodiment of the present invention and shows a workpiece PC gripped by the fingers la, Ib of the hand 1 as it is being loaded into a chuck CHK on a machine tool NCM which is the robot mate. Here a proximity switch SE is provided on the surface of the machine tool NCM where the workpiece is to be loaded, and is adapted to sense the attitude of the approaching finger Ib of hand l. As with the embodiments of Figs. 2 and 3, the robot is made to perform a trial loading operation once on the basis of the taught data, at which time the prevailing magnitude of the output signal from the proximity switch SE is stored in memory as the referential information ir. .The output magnitude an from the switch SE obtained during an actual subsequent loading operation is compared with L so that a judgment can be made regarding the accuracy of the operation Alternatively, a pressure sensor may be provided on or near the chuck CH to sense the pressure applied to the chuck when the workpiece PC is loaded A block diagram for realizing a robot control method in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 5. A robot controller RBC constituted by a microcomputer is provided with an arithmetic unit RBA and a memory RBM for storing, e.g., taught data and an control program, and is adapted to control a robot by exchanging signals with a machine tool.The taught data storage area of the ,memory RBM has the configuration shown in Fig. 6, in which positional information areas P and service code areas S are allotted in accordance with memory addresses 01 to n . Positions to be assumed by the hand 1 and hand operati ng speeds are stored in the P areas, while a grip instruction HD, a check instruction CH, and various instructions such as a release instruction and instructions for communication with the machine tool, are stored in the S areas. The check instructions are inserted beforehand at suitable ones of the service code areas In other words, a check instruction is inserted as a robot service code at the address of a taught data item corresponding to the robot hand position at which that status of an activity is desired to be checked.In the example of Fig. 6, a check is to be executed at the position indicated by positional information area P3.. Returning to Fig. 5, a pulse distributing circuitPDC receives a Z axis move command Zc from the robot controller RBC in accordance with the position and speed. information stored in the memory RBM, and performs an arithmetic pulse distributing operation based on the magnitude of Zc to produce command pulsesZp of a number corresponding to the magnitude of Zc. The command pulses Zp are applied to an error registerERR which also receives feedback pulses FBP each of which is generated whenever a motor DMZ, to be described later, rotates through a predetermined angle.The error register ERR is adapted to count up or to count down the command pulses Zp and feedback pulsesFBP in accordance with the direction of robot motor movement. More specifically, assume robot movement along the Z axis in the positive direction. In such case the content of error register ERR will be up counted by one count each time a command pulse Zp is generated, and will be down counted by one count each time a feedback pulse FBP is produced. Conversely, for movement along the Z axis in the negative direction, the content of error register ERR is counted down by one count. each time a command pulses Zp is generated, and counted up each time a feedback pulse FBP is generated.Thus the information stored in the error register ERR always represents the difference between the number of command pulses Zp and the number of feedback pulses FBP The error register ERR produces 2 digital error signal indicative of this difference. A digital to analog DA converter DAC receives the digital signal from the error register ERR and executes a DA conversion to produce an analog positional offset voltage Er which is proportional to the input digital signal, that is, to the content of the error registerERR. An adding subtracting circuit ADD produces a differential voltage Ec by computing the difference between the positional offset voltage Er and an actual speed voltage which is proportional to the actual speed of the motor DMZ.A speed control circuit VCC, which receives the voltage differential Ec from the adding subtracting circuit ADD, includes such circuitry not shown as a phase compensating circuit, thyristor phase control circuit and thyristor circuit, and is adapted to control the motor speed in such a manner that the voltage differential Ec approaches zero.Specifically, the thyristor phase control circuit advances or retards the thyristor firing phase in accordance with the magnitude of the voltage differential Ec, thereby regulating the voltage applied to the motor to control the rotational speed thereof. The motor DMZ referred to above is a DC motor for Z axis drive and receives the regulated voltage from the speed control circuit VCC. A tachogenerator TC is coupled directly to the DC motor shaft and produces the actual speed voltage Es whose amplitude is proportional to the actual rotational speed of the DC motor DMZ. A sensorRE, such as a rotary encoder or resolver, generates one feedback pulse FBP each time the DC motor DMZ rotates by a predetermined angle. ADC denotes an analog to digital AD converter which receives the output signals produced by the switches SA, SB or by the sensors SC, SD, SE for converting the magnitude of the received signal into a digital value MPX MPX designates a multiplexer which receives the digital signal ID from the AD converterADC. When the robot controller RBC delivers a teach signal CTS in the teach mode of operation, the multiplexer MPX transmits the digital sensor or switch output ID to the robot controller RBC. On the other hand, when the robot controller RBC sends a signal indicative of a check instruction CCS to the multiplexer MPX during the performance of a robot service, the digital signal ID is applied to a comparator CMR that will be described below.Upon receiving the digital signal ID indicative of the switch or sensor output, the robot controller RBC processes the signal in a predetermined manner and, using the arithmetic unit RBA, computes an allowable limit value Im determinative of a normal operating state. This value, namely the upper limit of the switch or sensor output, is written into a predetermined address of the memory TCM by a write command WTC, and is read out from the predetermined address by a read command RDC. The commands WTC, RDC are issued by the robot controller RBC.During the performance of a robot service, the robot controller RBC issues the state check signal CCS, the multiplexer MPX issues the digital signal ID indicative of the switch or sensor output, and the memory TCM delivers the limit value as signal Im, with Im and ID being applied to the comparator CMR where they are compared. When the magnitude of ID is found to exceed the limit value, the comparator CMR issues an alarm signal ALM. In the operation of the apparatus of Fig. 5, the robot controller RBC first is taught the required robot motions in the ordinary manner. Specifically, the items of taught robot data are written into the Irtemcr RBM as shown in Fig. 6. Next, the robot is caused to execute an activity based on the target data in crier to obtain the reference information indicative of the operating state, such as the above described information indicating tat a part is being grvp ed in a correct manner.This is referred to as an operating state teach mode. Ths, when a command indicative of this mode of operation is applied to the robot controller RBC, the robot controller RBC behaves just as if an actual robot service were to be performed. In other words, the robot controller RBC produces the Z axis movement command Zc in accordance with the taught data in memory RBM, and the pulse distributor PDC performs an arithmetic pulse distribution operation to deliver the distributed command pulses Zp.The error register ERR counts the distributed pulses Zp up or down in accordance with the direction of robot movement, sending the resulting counted value to the DA converter DAC which converts this. value into the positional offset voltage Er. The analog voltage Er is impressed upon the motor DMZ through the adding sub tracting circuit ADD and speed control circuit VCC, thereby driving the motor DMZ into rotation. As the motor DMZ rotates, the tachometer TC produces the actual speed voltage Es, and the sensor RE generates one feedback pulse FBP each time the DC motor DMZ rotates by a predetermined angle. The feedback pulses FBP enter the error register ERR which from now on delivers the arithmetic difference between the command pulses Zp and the feedback pulses FBP.The difference, namely the content of the error register, is converted into the voltage Er. Next, adding subtracting circuit ADD computes the voltage differential Ec, namely the deviation from the actual speed voltage Es. The motorDMZ rotates is accordance with the voltage differentialEc, so that the robot is transported toward the target position along the Z axis at the commanded speed In other words, the robot, in accordance with the taught data, is moved successively toward the target position and executes the predetermined service. When a check instruction CH is read from the taught data in memory RBM under these conditions, the arithmetic unit RBA of the robot controller RBC first issues the teach signal CTS, in response to which it receives the digital value ID indicative of the switch or sensor output, via the multiplexer MPX. Next, the arithmetic unit RBA subjects the digital value 1D to predetermined processing to obtain the limit value Im, which is then stored in the memory TCM, With the arrangement of Fig. 2, the output signals produced by both switches SA, SB are read in by the robot controller after the positioning operation at the measurement point. Thereafter, robot drive, positioning and, e.g, the fitting together of parts, take place in accordance with the item of taught data at the next address of the memory RBM. With the arrangement of Fig. 3, the outputs of sensors SCr SD are read in during the performance of the fitting operaiton. with Fig. 4, the output of sensor SE is read in during the performance of the loading activity Thus, what is essential is that a check insiructic op. be inserted in the taught data at a location corresponding to a predetermined positioning point. If this is done, then the switch or sensor output relating to the particular service at the point will be read into the robot controller RBC. On the other hand, during control of the robot in an actual operation i.e., in the playback mode of operation , the robot is likewise driven and controlled in accordance with the taught. data. Now when the check instruction CH is read from the taught data, the arithmetic unit RBA of the robot controller RBC delivers the read command RDC on line 12 in addition to the check signal on line awl As a result, the predetermined limit value Im is delivered by the memoryTCM, and the digital value ID is delivered by the multiplexer MPX, these values being fed into the comparator CMR which checks to determine whether the value ID exceeds the value Im.When this is indeed the case, the comparator CMR sends the alarm signal ALM to the robot controller RBC, in response to which the robot controller causes the hand 1 to release a gripped part,.halts the movement of the hand, or causes the hand to begin a subsequent gripping operation. It should be noted that the description in conjunction with Fig. 5 relates to the Z axis only. In practice, however, control is similarly effected for the other axes R axis, 9 axis as well. Furthermore, it has been described that the limit value is stored in the memory TCM. By providing a limit value arithmetic unit at the output side of the memory TCM and implementing the operation state teach mode a plurality of times, however, the average value or maximum and minimum values can be computed and stored in memory.in the above arrangement, the memory TCM, comparator CMR and the like have been descried as being located outside of the robot controller RBC. However, the robot controller, being constituted by a microcomputer, can be mad to perform the functions of these units and can be adapted to store the limit value along with the taught data. exles of the In accordance with the present invention as described and illustrated hereinabove, sensing means for sensing the operating state of a robot hand are provided on the hand, on a part or machine accompanying the robot hand, or at a predetermined point in theImmediate work area for the purpose of obtaining reference values indicative of the correct operating state. Specifically, the robot is placed in an operating state teach mode to cause the robot hand to execute an activity, just as in an actual operatic, in accordance with taught data, and the magnitudes of output signals from the sensing means obtained .n the operating state teach mcde are stored in memory as reference state information.Then, with the robot is placed in the playback mode of operation, the magnitudes of the sensor output signals ob aine 3 at such time are compared with the reference state information in said memory to monitor the operating state This makes it possible to readily sense any abnormality in the operating state so that robot activities may proceed safely without any risk of damage to the hand, a gripped part, a mating part or the robot mate, such as a machine tool. It is also possible to readily sense runaway of the robot if the robot should malfunction. Since the reference state information is set based. on the single performance of an actual robot activity in accordance with the operating state teach mode, the normality of an activity is sensed in an accurate manner and. the information is set in a very easy manner. As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.
