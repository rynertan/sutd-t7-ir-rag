# PROTEINACEOUS SUBSTANCE SHOWING ANTITUMOROUS ACTION AND METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A proteinaceous substance having the following bioche mical characteristics A a strong cytolvtic activity against mouse tumor cells L 929, but no cytotoxic activity for normal cells such as human fetus fibroblasts, human adult skin fibroblasts and chinese hamster fibroblasts Don, V 79 and therefore a high tumor specificity and B a strong anti tumor and immunogenic activity against Meth A sarcoma. When said substance is injected intrave nously to the syngenic BALB C mice inoculated with Meth A sarcoma at a quantity of more than 72 units head, not only a hemorrhagic necrosis, but also complete degradation is observed. Thereafter, even if it is attempted again to transplant the Meth A sarcoma cells under the skin of Mice cured completely, successful plantation is not observed because of an acquired immunity C the substance has no pyrogenetic action after intrave nous injection to rabbits D a molecular weight of 45,000 5,000 determined by the gel filtration method with Sephacryl S 200 and E an isoelectric point pl of 4.8 0.3 and a method for its manufacture.
