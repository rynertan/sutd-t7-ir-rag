# SUPPLY CONTROL VALVE WITH INTEGRAL PRESSURE LIMITER

## Abstract
In a pilot operated fluid supply valve the usual control pressure applied to the control surface 40, 42 of a main supply valve can be interrupted by a fluid switch 87, 93 and replaced with a pressure which closes the main supply valve. The fluid switch 87, 93 is responsive to the load pressure in the load port 26, 28 of the main valve. The fluid switch 87, 93 may include a rocker arm 100, 124 actuated by a diaphragm 118, 132 in fluid communication with the load port 26, 28 . In one system, main supply and waste diaphragm valves are controlled by a pilot valve 20 and a pressure reversing valve 74 and the fluid switch 87, 93 is positioned between one of those valves and the main supply valve. In another system, the main valves are controlled by a dual output pilot valve.
