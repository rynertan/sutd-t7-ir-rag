On the other hand, to a solution of trimethylsilylacetylene 5.7 ml in tetrahydrofuran 70 ml was added 1.55 N n butyllithium in n hexane 20.6 ml at 60 C. The mixture was allowed to warm to 25 C. Sulfur 1.15 g was added to the mixture at once at 25 C. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes under ice cooling, allowed to warm to 15 C and added to a solution of the residue A in tetrahydrofuran 150 ml at 40 C. The mixture was allowed to warm to 0 C and poured into a mixture of ice water and ethyl acetate and the mixture was adjusted to pH 7.5 with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The separated aqueous layer was adjusted to pH 2 with diluted hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo and triturated with diisopropyl ether to give 7 2 5 amino 1,2,4 thiadiazol 3 yl 2 ethoxyiminoacetamido 3 2 trimethylsilylethynylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid syn isomer 6.67 g . The following compounds were obtained according to similar manners to those of Examples 9 12, 14 and 29. A solution of 7 2 methoxyimino 2 2 2,2,2 trifluoroacetamido thiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid syn isomer 380 mg and sodium acetate 937 mg in water 8 ml was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The mixture was adjusted to pH 1.6 with 6N hydrochloric acid. This solution was subjected to column chromatography on macroporous non ionic adsorption resin Diaion HP 20 15 ml . After the column was washed with water, the elution was carried out with 25 aqueous isopropyl alcohol. The eluates containing the object compound were collected, evaporated to remove isopropyl alcohol under reduced pressure and lyophilized to give 7 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyiminoacetamido 3 vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid hydrochloride syn isomer 170 mg . The following compounds were obtained according to similar manners to those of Examples 16, 17 and 32. The following compounds were obtained according to a similar manner to that of Example 19. The following compounds were obtained according to a similar manner to that of Example 21. To a solution of benzhydryl 7 2 hydroxybenzylideneamino 3 Z 2 3 pyridyl vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate 2.3 g in ethyl acetate 46 ml was added concentrated hydrochloric acid 1 ml at ambient temperature and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes to give a precipitate of a viscous oil. The upper layer was removed by decantation and the resultant oil was triturated with a mixture of ethanol and diethyl ether to give benzhydryl 7 amino 3 Z 2 3 pyridyl vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate dihydrochloride 2.2 g . The following compound was obtained by reacting p nitrobenzyl 7 2 p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylmethoxyimino 2 2 2,2 2 trifluoroacetamido thiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate syn isomer according to a similar manner to that of Example 26. 7 2 Carboxymethoxyimino 2 2 2,2,2 trifluoroacetamido thiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 vinylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid syn isomer
