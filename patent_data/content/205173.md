## Description
The invention concerns a process for the manufacture of o nitrobenzaldehyde by oxidation of o nitrotoluene besides representing a useful intermediate in organic synthesis, o nitrobenzaldehyde is the main raw material for the preparation of niphedipine, which is a known drug. Ii is known to prepare o nitrobenzaldehyde starting from o nitrotoluene and from an alkyl oxalate, in the presence of an alcoholate, thereby obtaining o nitrophenylpyrruvic acid, which is then oxidized with sodium hypochlorite, in order to get the corresponding benzal chloride, subsequently hydrolized to the corresponding aldehyde such process is quite burdensome because of the necessity of using a three step reaction and of the presence of an alcoholate. A photochemical bromination of o nitrotoluene to the corresponding benzal bromide and subsequent alkaline hydrolysis of the bromide were also described, but this method proved to be of very little practical interest because benzal bromide can explode and because of the non selectivity of the bromination reaction. In Tetrahedron Letters, number 37, 1966, pages 4493 4498, o nitrotoluene is oxidized to o nitrobenzaldehyde by the dropwise addition of a solution of ceric ammonium nitrate in the same acid to the stirred solution of o nitrotoluene in perchloric acid at 80 C. According to Indian Journal of Chemistry, volumne 8, 1970, pages 977 980, the oxidation of o nitrotoluene by Ce One object of the invention is that of providing a simple and cheap process for the preparation of o nitrobenzaldehyde by oxidation of o nitrotoluene with an oxidizing agent which can easily be regenerated at the end of the reaction and which may then be repeatedly re used. Another object is that of providing a process ensuring a very good selectivity to o nitro benzaldehyde and satisfactory yields with respect to the oxidizing agent. A still further object is that of providing a process that can be carried out under mild temperature conditions, within short operational times and as a continuous cycle. These and still other objects can be easily reached by a process characterized in that o nitrotoluene is made to react with an aqueous solution containing Cerium o nitrotoluene and Ce It is however preferable to use 0 nitrotoluene in amounts from 1.8 to 20 times greater than the stoichiometric requirement, i.e. it is better to use from 0.45 to 5 moles of o nitrotoluene per mole of Ce According to a preferred embodiment, one may prepare an o nitrotoluenedispersion within an aqueous solution of 5 9N perchloric acid and then add to such a dispersion the aqueous solution of Ce It is however preferable to gradually add the aqueous solution of Ce When the aqueous solution of Ce The starting aqueous solution of Ce When an excess of o nitrotoluene is preferably used, the end of the reaction is proved by the disappearance of the typical colour of the Ce 25 g of Ce₂ CO₃ ₃.H₂O were dissolved in 300 cm³ of an aqueous solution of 7,8 N HClO₄. Thereafter 250 cm³ of the thus obtained solution, were electrolyzed in a 400 cm³ electrolytical cell, under a constant current of 500 mA. The Pt anode had a surface of about 20 cm² and the Cu cathode had a surface of about 1 cm². The whole electrical load was 3650 coulomb. The resulting 0.069 M solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1, were introduced, under nitrogen atmosphere, 5.6 g of o nitrotoluene 41.2 mmoles and 60 cm³ of 7,8 N HClO₄ the mixture was heated up to 70 C and then gradually additioned, at a constant rate of 1.5 cm³ minute, with 228 cm³ of a 0.08M solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1 were introduced, under nitrogen atmosphere, 1.8 g of o nitrotoluene 13.0 mmoles and 60 cm³ of 7,8 N HClO₄ the mixture was heated up to 70 C and then gradually additioned, at a constant rate of 1.5 cm³ minute, with 45 cm³ of a 0.51 M solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1 were introduced, under nitrogen atmosphere, 1.5 g of o nitrotoluene 11.3 mmoles and 60 cm³ of 7,8 N HClO₄ the mixture was heated up to 70 C and then gradually additioned, at a constant rate of 1.5 cm³ minute, with 245 cm³ of a 0.093 M solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1 were introduced, under nitrogen atmosphere, 6.5 g of o nitrotoluene 47.4 mmoles and 50 cm³ of a 0.71 M aqueous solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1 were introduced under nitrogen atmosphere, 9.96 g of o nitrotoluene 72.7 mmoles and 60 cm³ of 7,8 N HClO₄ the mixture was heated up to 70 C and then gradually additioned, at a constant rate of 1.5 cm³ minute, with 220 cm³ of a 0.081 M solution of Ce Into the reactor of example 1 were introduced, under nitrogen atmosphere, 4.46 g of o nitrotoluene 32.5 mmoles and 60 cm³ of 7,8 N HClO₄ the mixture was heated up to 70 C and then gradually additioned, at a constant rate of 30 cm³ minute, with 220 cm³ of a 0.081 M solution of Ce
