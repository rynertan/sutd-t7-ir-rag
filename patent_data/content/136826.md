# Electric irons.

## Abstract
An electric steam iron includes a water tank and a steam generating soleplate with parts for distribution of the steam. A pump is connected to the tank with a manually actuable handle button to deliver water to the steam generating means. The iron may be controlled by a low DC voltage electronic circuit control having a printed circuit board disposed in the housing high in the handle away from the soleplate. A power resistor is used to reduce high AC line voltage to low DC supply to the printed circvuit board and a mounting is provided directly on the soleplate to contain the resistor in a thermally close coupling to the soleplate so that the hot soleplate is used as a heat sink to dissipate resistor heat.
