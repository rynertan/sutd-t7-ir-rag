# Apparatus and method for measuring the partial pressure of a gas.

## Abstract
This specification discloses a device to determine the percentage of oxygen in an ambient atmosphere. The device, which is immersed in the atmosphere, is cons tructed to define an enclosed volume in which the atmo sphere can be established by means of a small leak. The enclosing structure contains two partitions which can con duct oxygen ions and act as electrochemical cells. One partition is called the pump cell while the other is called the sensor cell. When attached to an external power supply, the current Ip drawn through the pump cell either adds or removes from or to the ambient gaseous oxygen from the volume. As a result of the pumping action, an EMF V
