# Power transmission belt of the raw edge type.

## Abstract
A power transmission V belt comprises a layer of tensile members 1 extending longitudinally of the belt and embedded between a compression section 3 and a tension section 2 disposed respectivoly inwardly and outwardly of the tensile member layer 1 , the tension and compression sections each including a rubber layer in which are embedded short fibres 6 extending transversely of the belt. Bonded to an outward surface of the tension section 2 and or embedded in an inward portion 3 of the compression section 3 is at least one ply of rubbered fabric 4 woven in plain or twill weave from crimped nylon yarns 4a subjected to wooly treatment which are high in stretchability and which extend generally longitudinally of the belt and cotton yarns. nylon yarns or polyester yarns 40 which are high in rigidity and which extend transversely of the belt. The belt is thus made longitudinally flexible but laterally rigid. The rubber layer and short fibres in the tension section 2 can be omitted, and instead at least one ply of rubbered fabric 5 can be bonded in lamination to an outward surface of the tensile member layer 1 .
