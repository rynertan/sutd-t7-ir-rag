The compounds of the present invention have been found to possess excellent antihypertensive properties and are also effective antithrombotic agents. The compounds of the formula I and II can be prepared according to several processes, namelyA. The Grignard reaction EMI10.1 EMI10.2 R6 can also be in the 3 position of the imidazole ring.When R6 is a benzyl group it can be removed with sodium in liquid ammonia EMI10.3 after which follows a dehydration process with KHS04 as above a and the formed double bond is hydrogenated to a compound of the formulaEMI11.1 B. The Wittig reaction EMI11.2 EMI11.3 can also be in the N3 position.When R6 is a benzyl group it can be removed with sodium in liquid ammonia yielding the compound EMI11.4 EMI12.1 wherein Rlo is a hydrolysable group as for instance CO Alkyl, wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 7 carbon atoms,EMI13.1 wherein R is a lower alkyl group or phenyl or CH o Alkyl 2, wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 7 carbon atomsThe N substituent R10 can also be in the 3 position.F.EMI13.2 Process A Grignard reaction In the first step the solvent is preferably diethylether or tetrahydrofuran and the temperature varies from about 400C to the boiling point of tetrahydrofuran.The second step is a dehydration step and can be performed e.g. by heating with potassiumhydrogensulfate to about 100 2000C. In the third step the double bond is hydrogenated by.conventional methods, e.g. using Pd on carbon as catalyst and e.g. aqueous ethanol, ethanol or tetrahydrofuran as solvent.If R6 is a benzyl group it can be removed at a low temperature, e.g. OOto 400C, with metallic sodium in liquid ammonia.Process B is a Wittig reaction comprising the reaction of an N substituted imidazole 2 aldehyde with an aralkylidenetriphenyl phosphorane, which is prepared from the corresponding aralkyltriphenyl phosphonium halide and a basic agent, preferably butyllithium. The reaction is performed in an inert solvent, e.g.tetrahydrofuran, at elevated temperature. In the steps 2 and 3 of process B the formed double bond is hydrogenated with conventional methods and the benzyl group can be removed as in process A.In process C an arylalkylimidazoline derivative is aromatised to the corresponding imidazole derivative.In the first stage the imidazoline compound is synthesized by heating the corresponding arylalkylnitrile and a salt of ethylenediamine, preferably the p toluenesulfonate salt, to 150 2000C. In the second step the imidazoline derivative is reacted in a suitable solvent, e.g.methylene chloride, at elevated temperature with e.g.barium manganate, SeO2, CuO or palladium on carbon.According to process D an arylalkylnitrile is converted to the corresponding imidamide by reaction first with HCl gas under dry conditions in absolute ethanol at a low temperature, about OOC, and then with ethanolic ammonia preferably at room temperature. In the second step the imidamide derivative is reacted with an acetaldehyde derivative at room temperature in a suitable solvent, e.g. a lower alcohol or an aqueous alcohol. Suitable acetaldehyde derivatives are hydroxyacetaldehyde, halogenacetaldehyde and their dimethyl and diethylacetals. The hydrolysis according to process E is performed according to conventional methods.Process F concerns a process in which imino ethers are reacted with aminoketones. Aminoacetaldehydes and their acetal derivatives can also be used. Especially useful is e.g. the dimethylacetal of aminoacetaldehyde of the formula MeO 2CHCH2NH2. The reaction is performed e.g. by refluxing in isopropanol. As stated herein above, the compounds of the general formula I and II and their non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts have valuable pharmacological properties and have been found to possess excellent anti hypertensive activity in mammals. This activity makes these imidazole derivatives particularly useful in the treatment of high blood pressure. Administration of isomeric compounds of formula I , their non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts or mixtures thereof may be achieved parenterally, intravenously or orally. Typically, an effective amount of the derivative is combined with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. As used herein, the term effective amount encompasses those amounts which yield the desired activity without causing adverse side effects. The precise amount employed in a particular situation is dependent upon numerous factors such as method of administration, type of mammal, condition for which the derivative is administered, etc., and of course the structure of the derivative. When used for their anti hypertensive activity the compounds of the invention are generally administered orally in a daily dosage of 0.5 to 5 mgXkg of treated mammal. The pharmaceutical carriers which are typically employed with the derivatives of the present invention may be solid or liquid and are generally selected with the planned manner of administration in mind. Thus, for example, solid carriers include lactose, sucrose, gelatin and agar, while liquid carriers include water, syrup, peanut oil and olive oil. Other suitable carriers are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulations. The combination of the derivative and the carrier may be fashioned into numerous acceptable forms, such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, emulsions and powders. The anti hypertensive properties of the imidazole derivatives of the present invention have been determined according to the following procedure.Sprague Dawley rats of normal weight were first anesthetized with urethane. After this, the femoral artery was connected by way of a polyethylene tube with a blood pressure transducer. The test substance was then injected into the femoral vein and the blood pressure and the pulse frequency were registered with a recorder. The antithrombotic activity was investigated in vitro. The inhibiting activity of the compounds against ADP and collagen induced aggregation of thrombocytes was measured. In the test thrombocytes from a cow were used. To 1.2 ml of plasma containing 250000 thrombocytes mm were added 50 41 of a solution of the compound to be tested. After 10 min incubation either ADP or collagen was added.
