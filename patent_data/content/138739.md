# Variable speed drive motor system with inverter control.

## Abstract
A variable speed drive motor system is disclosed. The motor system 10 is particularly suitable for use as a drive system for a centrifugal compressor 12 in a refrigeration system. The motor system 10 includes an AC auxiliary mo tor generator 11 with inverter control. The motor generator 11 is interconnected through a transmission system 48 to a main motor 10 to drive an output drive shaft 42 at varying speeds. Preferably, the interconnecting transmission sys tem 48 is an epicyclic gear system.
