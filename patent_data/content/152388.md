# A METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE FLOW RATE OF A FLOWABLE MATERIAL

## Abstract
The rate of flow of a flowable material. such as a liquid, pellets or cereal grains is measured by causing the flowing material to fall on an inclined surface of a member 7 and sensing the inertial force exerted by the material on the member 7. The force exerted may be measured by sensing the deflection of the member 7 by means of electrical sensors attached to the member 7 or to a support 12 carrying the member 7. The sensors preferably comprise piezoresis tive elements 13, 14 included in an electrical bridge circuit.
