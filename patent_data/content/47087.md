# Geothermal energy extraction apparatus.

## Abstract
Geothermal deep well energy extraction apparatus is provided of the general kind in which solute bearing hot water is pumped to the earth s surface from a subterranean location by utilising thermal energy extracted from the hot water for operating a primary turbine motor 30 for driving a primary electrical generator 31 at the earth s surface, the solute bearing water being returned by a reinjection well 59 . A surface located auxiliary turbine pump combination with both turbine 4 and brine pump 13 elements acting in series with down well counterparts 21 23 is provided to furnish inter alia the pressure necessary for reinjection of the brine.
