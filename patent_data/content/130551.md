# Control method and apparatus for rolling mill.

## Abstract
In a rolling mill having a pair of upper and lower work rolls 1, 2 , defining a pressure gap therebetween through which a material is passed to be rolled, method and apparatus for con trolling the rolling mill under the different peripheral speed roll ing operation in which one 2 of the rolls is driven at a prede termined peripheral speed by controlling the speed of a motor 11 for driving the one roll, and the other roll 1 is controlled to generate a torque corresponding to a difference, τ τ
