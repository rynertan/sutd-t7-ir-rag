# Series resonant converter.

## Abstract
A series resonant converter is disclosed, in which a series resonant circuit 26 consisting of a resonant capacitor 16 and a resonant inductor 17 is connected in series with AC input terminals of a rectifier 13 . Positive current and negative current are alternately caused to flow from a power supply 12, 19 through the series combination of the series resonant circuit 26 and rectifier 13 through on off control of a plurality of switch elements 11, 18 , thereby obtaining a DC voltage from the rectifier. A parallel resonant circuit 23 is provided in series with the series resonant circuit 26 . The resonant frequency of the parallel resonant circuit is suffi ciently lower than the resonant frequency of the series resonant circuit and higher than the audible frequency range.
