# Control apparatus for heating appliance.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for a heating appliance, such as a microwave oven, uses a microcomputer 100 as its control means. A power switch 24 for supplying power to heating means, such as a magnetron 18 , is controlled by two switching devices 30, 32 , which switching devices are controlled by the microcomputer. When the user actuates a start switch 42 , the first switching device 32 is actuated by a control signal from the microcomputer, and thereafter, the second switching device 30 is actuated to activate the power switch 24 if the heating appliance is in proper operating condition. The microcomputer 100 stops the entire heating operation whenever the heating means is not operating properly, by sensing an improper condition of the second switching device 30 .
