# Multiple wheel memory selection device for brake control system.

## Abstract
A memory control device for a multiple wheel brake control system includes a control bit C1 under computer control. This control bit C1 is coupled to one A₈ of a plurality of address terminals of a memory device 70 such that one address terminal A₈ can be controlled by the computer 40 , independent of normal addressing. In this way the computer 40 can configure the memory device 70 to access either of two distinct blocks of memory.
