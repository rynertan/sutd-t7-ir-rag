## Description
Optically active heterocyclic compounds, their synthesis, and pharmaceutical formulations containing them This invention relates to optically active heterocyclic compounds, their synthesis, separation of their optically active isomers and their use in medicine. In the complete specifications of our UK published specification No 2 032 419A,European Patent application numbers 78. 100823.0 and 78.101491.5, and Belgium Patent No 855 337 we describe certain hydantoin derivatives, including tliose defined hercinbelow in formula I , which have been found to have pharmacological properties related to those of natural prostaglandins, as demonstrated by their ability to mitnic or antagonise the physiological effects of the natural prostaglandins in various biological preparations. In particular, certain compounds of formula I have been found to be potent mimetics of the antiplatelet aggregatory properties of prostaglandin E1. In formula I EMI2.1 there are oiily t wo optically active centres Z is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms X is methylene, oxa 0 or thia S XÚ is phenylene, C C , cis or trans CH CHor CH2 CH2 X2 is a covalent bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms XÚ or Xê optionally has one of any methylene groups replaced by oxa or thia provided that at least one carbon atom separates the oxa or thia from any 5 tetrazolyl or carbonyl or C C or cis or trans CH CH group, further provided that X XÚ Xêcontains not more than one of either an oxa or thia X is selected from 5 tetrazolyl, carboxyl, carbamoyl alkoxycarbonyl and hydroxymethyl each R is the same and is selected from hydrogen and methyl R1 is hydrogen or alkyl Y is a covalent bond or straight or symmetrically branched alkylene having 1 to 7 carbon atoms optionally substituted at the carbon adjacentEMI3.1 by two groups each of which may be alkyl or a cyclic radical provided no optical centre is introduced YÚ is hydrogen, alkoxy of 1 to 7, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, a cyclic radical, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or benzyloxy, wYncrei.l each of phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy and benzyloxy may be substituted in the benzene ring by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, halo, nitro, amino, acylamino, alkenyl, alkoxy, phenyl, benzyloxy and alkyl which may itself be substituted by one or more halo groups or Y and YÚ together form an alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms having at least one hydrogen replaced by fluoro. In the definitions of Y and YÚ in formula CI , the term cyclic radical means the monovalent radical derived by loss of a ring hydrogen atom from a monocyclic or polycyclic compound having fi om 3 to 12 ring atoms selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which compound may be saturated or unsaturated and may be further substituted by one or more alkyl groups, but excluding phenyl.Such cyclic radicals include cycloalkyl having 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl bicycloalkyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms such as norbornyl bicyclo 2,2,1 heptyl and adamantyl, spiroalkanyl having 5 to 12 carbon atoms such as 2 spiro 3,3 heptyl, l spiro , nonane and S spiro 4,5 docane cycloalkenyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms such as 4 cyclopentene heterocyclic radicals such as tetrahydrofuranyl and tetrahydropyranyl and heteroaryl radicals such as thicnyl, furyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl and diazepinyl. Included in the term cyclic radical are those wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluoro. Unless otherwise stated, in formula I and other formulae in this specification, alkyl moieties are selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl, including all isomers thereof and alkenyl groups have 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example vinyl. In a compound of formula I the bonding of the divalent phenylene group may be otbo, meta or para,and in these variants any oxa or thia group is preferably adjacent the phenylene. When XÚ is other than phenylene, then N2 may be CH2 O CH2 or CH2 S CH2 Included in the scope of compounds of formula I are the salts corresponding to the carboxylic acids and tetrazoles when X3 is carboxyl or tetrazolyl respectively, and the salts which may also be formed when Z is hydrogen.Particularly valuable salts for medical purposes are those having a pharmaceutically acceptable cation such as ammonium or an alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium, an alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium and magnesium, or an organic base, particularly an amine such as ethanolamine. Salts having non pharmaceutically acceptable cations are included within the ambit of this invention as useful intermediates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or the acids or esters of formula I . Compounds of formula I wherein Z is hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example methyl or butyl X is CH2 ,XÚ is CH2CH2 or Cll CIS ,X2 is alkylene of 1 to 5 in particular 3 carbon atoms, and X is alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl or a salt thereof R, RÚ and Y are as hereinbefore defined and is hydrogen, phenyl, benzyl, or cycloalkyl of 4 to 7 carbon atoms have particularly interesting prostaglandinlike properties. Within this definition are included the subclass wherein Z is hydrogen. The 5 carbon atom of the hydantoin ring of hydantoins of formula I is asymmetric, and a further asymmetric centre is present atEMI6.1 Compounds of formula I therefore exist as four isomers of formul IA , IB , IC and ID EMI7.1 Wherein Z, X,XÚ, Xê, X5 R, RÚ, Y and YÚ are as defined in formula I . Hydantoins f formula I are separable by thin layer chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography HPLC into two diastcreomers, each of which is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers namely, a mixture of an enantiomer of formula IA and an enantiomer of formula ID0, and a mixture of an enantiomer of formula IB and an enantiomer of formula JC . On separation of the diastereomers one dia stereomer may be converted to a mixture of the two diastereomers by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, and subsequently re separated to provide two diastercomers. Repeated use of this technique enables the effectual conversion of one diastereomer to the other. Specific examples of the separ ation of diastcreomers of compounds of formula I are given in our above named co pending applications. It is also desirable to resolve one or both of the individual diastereomers into their enantioulers, since it is known to persons skilled in the art that the larger part of the biological activity of any racemic mixture is often attributable to one of the pair of enantiomers comprising tlic acetic mixture.The applicants in attempting to effect such a resolution by using conventional resolving agents, found that the process proved difficult in view of the distance between the optically active centres and the carboxyl group. In order to solve the problems encountered during these experiments to reso ve the enantiomers, the applicants attempted to resolve a racemic ester of formula II EMI9.1 wherein X, XÚ and x 2 are as defined in formula l , X and G are the same or different and each is alkoxy carbonyl for example ethoxycarbonyl. At first, con ventional methods were used, for example tartaric acid or dibenzeyl tartaric acid were used as resolving agents but this, 100, proved unsucce Therefore, until the making of tie present invention, a successful method for the resolution of the two enantiomers of one or, optionally, both of the diastereomers of compounds of Formula I had not been found. Referring to Scheme A, it has no unexpectedly been found that a racemic diester of formula II undergoes selective hydrolysis on leaving an aqueous solution of a compound of formula TI to stand at room temperature for sevcral days, or by heating for several hours, in the presence of a carboxylic acid, for example acetic acid, t o afford a racemic mondester of formula 1I wherein X, 1 X2 and X3 are as defined in formula II und GÚ is carboxyl. Subsequent acyclation by a standard method known in the art, for example bv reaction with an acid halide such as acetyl chloride or, preferably, an acid anhydride such as accdic anhydride in an inert solvent, affords a racemic acylated mondester of formula IV wherein X, XÚ, Xê, X and GÚ are as defined in formula III , Rê is CH2 nQ wherein n is 1, 2 or 3 and Q is hydrogen or jialo, for example chloro. Selective deacylation, in particular deacetylat ion, using a suitable e agent such as all enzyme affords a compound of formula IIIA wherein X, XÚXê, X and GÚ are as defined in formula III , and a compound of formula IVB wherein x, XÚ, X , S3 GÚ and Rê are as defined in formula IV . In particular, it has been found hat selective deactylation using porcine renal acylase I in aqueous solution at neutral or slightly alkaline pH proceeds almost to completion. Separation of the specie so formed may be effected by extraction of the acylated species into, for example, chloroform, the amino acid remaining in the aqueous phase. re particularly, it has becn rprisingly found that the selective deacetylation of a compound of formula IV which is 2 acetamido nonanedioic acid 9 ethyl ester using porcine renal acylase I proceeds faster tban would have been cxpected from reaction rates given inJ P Greenstein and M Winitz, Chemistry or theAmino Acids Vol. 1, Wiley, Ne York, 1961 pages 744 ff. SCHEME AEMI12.1 The compound of formula IIIA is then optioiially esterified using a standard method known in the art, for example, reaction with an appropriate alcohol such as ethanol and thionyl chloride te afford mamino diester of formula IIA which is one of the enantiomers of the amino diester of formula II . The compound of formula IVB may be optionally deacylated and re esterified to afford an amino diester of formula IIB which is the other enantiomer of the amino diester of formula II . Preferred compounds of formula II for use in the present invention are those wherein Z is hydrogen or alkyl X is methylene X is CH CH or CH2 CH2 X is alkylene having 4 to 6 carbon atoms X3 is alkoxycarbonyl such as ethoxycarbonyl Y is a covalent bond YÚ is cycloalkyl of 4 to 7 carbon atoms Each R is hydrogen and R1 is hydrogen or methylEspecially preferred are those wherein Z and R1 are each hydrogen, for example, diethyl 2 aminononanedioate. A preferred enantiomer of a compound of formul a II is a compound of formula IIA , for example diethyl S 2 aminononanedioate. Where the selective deacylation of a compound of formula IV proceeds to completion of the reaction, the isomers of formula IIA or IIB finally produced would be 100 pure. Where the selective deacylation proceeds almost to completion, the isomer of formula IIA produced would be 100p pure while the isomer of formula 1113 may be mixed with a small amount of that of formula IIA . The compounds of formula IIIA may then be converted to the compounds of formula I b methods analogous to those described in our co pending applications, as shown in Scheme B. Initially, the compound of formula IIA is converted to a mixture of epimers of formulae VA and V 3 EMI14.1 which may then be separated, for example, by HPLC. oreover, it will be understood that the re esterification could have been effected at a later stage in the process, for example by esterifying the compound of formular VIIA or VA . Hence, in the formulae of these compounds and accordingly of the intermediates for the synthesis of these compunds, G could be replaced by G . In this case, the preferred monoester of formula IIIA is S 2 aminononanedioic acid 9 ethyl ester. SCHEME BEMI15.1 wherein G, X, X1, x2 and X3 arc as defined in formula IIA and R, R1 Y and Y1 and Y1 are as defined in formula I by reaction of a compound of formula IIA with a racemic mixture of compounds of formulae VIA and VIB EMI16.1 wherein R, R1, Y and Y1 are as defined in formulae VA and VB , and Q1is halo, preferably bromo. The reaction may be carried out by heating in the absence of a solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent such as ethanol. The mixture of compounds of formula VA with compounds of formula VB may also be prepared by reduction of a ketone of formula VIIA EMI17.1 wherein G, R, X, XÚ, X2 ,X3 , and YÚ are as defined in formulae VA and VB . The reduction may be effected by standard methods knon in the art, for example with a metal borohydride. The intermediates of formula VIIA may be prepared by reaction of an amine of formula IIA with an unsaturated ketone of formula VIII C R 2 CH.CO.Y.YÚ VIII wherein R, Y and YÚ have the same meaning as in formula VIIA the reaction being effected in the presence or absence of an inert solvent and at room temperature or optionally with cooling or heatlllg. A compound of formula VA or VB prepared as hereinbefore described may be used to prepare one of the optically active forms of a compound of formula IX EMI18.1 wherein G, Z, X, X1,X2 X3 R, RÚ, Y and YÚ are as previously defined, provided that G may also be nit rile by reaction with cyanic acid or an alkyl iso cyanate depcnding respectively on whether Z is hydrogen or alkyl. When cyanic acid is used, the cyanic acid is conveniently produced in situ by the use of an alkali metal cyanate, e.g potassium cyanate, and an acid which may be present as an acid addition salt of the compound of formula VA or VB or a free acid of formula VA or VB wherein G is carboxyl.Alternatively an equivalent amount of mineral acid or organic acid may be added to the reaction medium. An inert solvent is used which is preferably polar such as water or a mixture of water with acetone, domethylformamide, dimethylsulplhoxide, or a lower alkanol such as ethanol, an ether, or halogenated hdyrocarbon such as chloroform, Where desired, for example if no solvent is used, the reaction may be promoted by heating the reactants. Similar reaction conditions may be used when an alkyl iso cyanate is used except that it is unnecessary to provide an equivalent amount of acid, as an acid addition salt or otherwise, with the reactants. Instead of using a cyanate or isocyanate, a compound of formula VA or VB may be reacted ith urrea, nitrourea or an N alkylurea as appropriate.A solvent is not essential but if desired an iner solvent such as one mentioned abovc may he used, and the reaction is preferably effected at an elevated temperature, for example 1000 to 1250C but temperatures up to 150 C may be employed. Cyclisation of the compounds of formula IXA or IXB , comprises one of the methods for synthesising compounds of formula IA or IB , respectively, as may be found in the art for the synthesis of compounds of analogous structure and, in particular, one of the methods for synthesiting compounds of formula I as described in our abovementioned co pending patent applications. The reaction may be effected in the absence of a solvent, but iii desired an inert solvent may be used, for example a hydrocarbon such as petrol.Alternatively, where G has been converted to the ester Gt by standard methods as desoribed above, cyclisation may be effected in the presence of a suitable base, for example an alkoxide such as sodium etliox ide The compounds of formula IA or IB may then be optionally converted into the compounds of formula IC or ID , respectively, by treatment with aqueous sodium hydroxide and separation of the resulting mixture of epimers with HPLC. The present invention therefore provides the preparation of pure or substantially pure as hereinafter defined compounds of formula TA and IB .Thus, after optional mild hydrolysis of a compound of formula IA or TB for example, to convert a compound wherein X3 is alkoxycarbonyl to a compound the compound of formula IA or IB so produced may be mixed with a small amount of the epimer of formula IC or ID , respectively, in a ratio of not less than about 95 5 w w. Therefore, by substantially pure or in substantially pure form is meant not less than 95 by weight of the stated compound. Further methods for preparing compounds of formula TA , IB , IC or ID are set out below by referring to the preparatioii of the compounds of formula IA und IB . The analogous processes for preparing the compounds of formula IC and ID are to be implied hereinbelow. Hydantoins of formula CIA or IB may be prcp pared by cyclisation of a compound of formula XA or XB respectively EMI21.1 wherein Z, X, XÚ,Xê, X3 R, Rl, Y and yl are as defined in formula IA or IB , respectively, andG2 is carboxyl or a reactive derivative thereof such as alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl. Compounds of formula XA and XB may be cyclised under similar conditions as a compound of formula IXA or IXB and conveniently the method used to prepare a compound of formula XA or . XB is chosen such that the prevailing reaction conditions permit spontaneous cyclisation. Optional conversion into hydantoins of formula IC or ID as hereinbefore described may follow. The intermediates of formula XA or XB may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula VIA or VIB , respectively, with a compound of formula XIA EMI22.1 wherein G, Z, X,XÚ,ê and X3 have the same meaning as in formula XA or XB and in formula VIA or VIB Q1 is halogeno, preferably chloro or bromo. The reaction may be effected by admixture of the reactants or optionally an inert solvent is used and the mixture is heated. Suitable solvents include alkanols ethers, hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. The diastereomers so formed may be separated by HPLC. The compounds of formula XIA may themselves be made by reacting an appropriatc carbamic acid derivative, or example an alkyl ester with a compound of formula IIA ,using a technique known to those skilled in the art. In a method related to those described hereinbefore, the hydantoins of formula IA or IB may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XIIA or XIIB EMI23.1 wherein each of Z, R, RÚ, X, XÚ, Xê, X , Y and YÚ has the same meaning as in formula IA or IB , resp tively, with a carbonic cid derivative.Any carbonic acid derivative Known to those skilled ill the art as appropriate may be used, for example phosgene diphenylcarbonat or an alkyl h loformate such as ethyl chioroformate. The reaction is desirably effected in the presence of a base, for example an amine such as triethylamine or di iso propyl ethylamine, and using an inert aprotic solvent such as toluene, dimethylformamide or an ether such as diethyl ether. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature but if desired the reaction mixture may be heated. Optional conversion into hydantoins of formula IC or ID as hereinbefore described may follow. The intermediates of formula NIIA or XTTB may be made using methods analogous to those described above for the preparation of compounds of formula VA or VB , respectively. The four isomers of hydantoins of formula I wherein Z is alkyl may also be prepared by alkylation, using an alkylating agent which may be designated as a reactive ester derivative of an alcohol J3 OH of the corresponding isomer of a compound of formula XIII and separating the resulting Mixture of isomers for example by HPLC. EMI25.1 In formula XIII J has the same meaning as Z JÚ is X XÚ Xê X , J is hdyrogen and Jê is C R 2 CH2 C RÚ OH Y YÚ Suitable reactive ester derivatives include chloride, bromidc, iodide and sulphonates such as p toluenesulphonate, methanesulphonate and benzene sulphonate. The alkylation may be effected using reaction conditions which are known in the art to be suitable, for example in the presence of a base such an alkali metal hydride, alkali metal amidc, or alkali metal alkoxidc, typically sodium hydride or a sodium alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent which simply acts as a diluent for the reactants such as toluene, dioxan, ether, dimethylformamide, tetra hydrofuran, dimethylsuplphoxide or acetonitrile or when the base is an alkali metal alkoxide then the corresponding alkanol may be used. It will be appreciated ihat the intermediates of formula XI wherein J is hydrogen are also compounds of formula I and may be prepared by one of the foregoing methods. The compounds of formula XI may further be prepared by adaptation of methods already known in the art see for example Chemical Reviews 1950 46 p 403 425 The alcohols of any of tlie isomers of hydantoins of formula. I wherein X3 is hydroxv methyl may also be obtained by reduction with an appropriate reducing agent of the correspond acid, ester, acid halide, acid anliydride or aldehyde.The appropriate reducing agent will depend on the particular substrate, but a reactant which may be used is sodium in ethanol. In particular, a carboxylic acid may, for example, be converted to a corresponding mixed anhydride with ethyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as t riethyl amine, and subsequently reduced to the alcohol. using sodium borohydride. Similarly an ester nlay be reduced to the alcohol using di iso butyl aluminium Ilydride in an inert solvent sich ns ethyl or hydro carbon such as bexane or benzene.Such alcohols may also be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively the isomers of alcohols of formula I wherein X is hydroxymethyl may be prepared by hydrolysis of a corresponding X halide with an appropriate reagent For this purpose a hydroxide may be used for example an aqueous alkali or a suspension of silver oxide in water. In the synthesis of any of the isomers of hydantoins of formula I it may be desirable to protect the hydroxyl group iII he side chain during the course of the reaction. This may be readily effected in a known manner using a protecting group such as acyl, aroyl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, 1 ethox ethyl or aralkyl, for example benzyl. Removal of protecting groups may be carried out by appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art for example an acyl group may be removed by acid or base hydrolysis, and a benzyl group by reductive cleavage. Where the compounds of formula I have a C C orCH CH bond these may be converted by conventional hydrogenation techniques, for example using a Lindlar type or Adams catalyst, to the corresponding ethylenic or saturated compounds as appropriate In all of the foregoing chemical procedures it. is of course evident that the choice of rractant will be dietated in part by the functional groups present in the substrate, and where necessary reactants having an appropriate selectivity of action must be used. The hydantoins of formula I are of va uc in having pharmacological properties related to those of natural prostaglandins as described in our applications listed above. A group of compounds which are particularly valuable as inhibitors or platelet aggregation are those of formula I wherein Z is hydrogen, X is CH2 , XÚ CH2.CH2 or CH CH , Xê is alkylene optionally including an oxa or thia group, X is COOII and Y is a bond or branched alkylene having a tertiary carbon atom adjacent to C RÚ OH and gamma Ú is cycloalkyl.Within this group of compounds, are those wherein CH2 XÚ Xê COOH is carboxyhexyl, carboxymethoxybutyl, carboxymethylthiobutyl and the corresponding unsaturated radicals where , is CH CH , Y is a bond and Y1 is cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Particular compounds which may be mentioned for their anti platelet aggregatory properties are 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin, 5 4 carboxymethoxybutyl 1 3 cyclohexyl3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin, 5 4 carboxymethylthiobutyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin, 5 6 carboxyhex 22 enyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3hydroxypropyl hydantoin and 5 4 carboxymethoxybuty 2Z onyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydanttoin. The hereinbefore described methods of preparing the individual optical isomers of compounds of formula I , have maeRc possible the investigation of thein biological properties. It has been found, as might have been expected, that one of Iihe optical isomers in each diastereomer of one of the compounds of formula CI namcd above, namely, 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxy propyl hydantoin is a greater inhibitor of platelet aggregation than the other.That is, the corresponding compound of formula IN is more active than the corresponding compound of formula ID and the corresponding compound of. formula IB is more active than the corresponding compound of formula IC , However, it has unexpectedly been found that, in the case of 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin, the isomer corresponding to that of fornula IA , namely, 5S 5 6 carboxy hexyl 1 3R 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin has an anti platelet aggregation inhibitory effect which is at least twice that of the activity of the corresponding racemate while its mirror image, namely, 5R 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3S 3 cyclohexyl3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin is inactive.Specifically, the activity of the racernate a mixture of the 5S,3R and the 5R, 3S isomers is in the range of from 12 to 16 tines that of PGEl, while the activity of the 5S, 3R enantiomer is of the order of 40 times that of PGE1. The 5S, 3S and 5R, 3R isomersHave an activity of 0.06 and 0.05 times that of PGE1, respectively. The applicants bclieve that, provided that the configuration at the two optical centres remain constant a similar effect could be found for all compounds of formula I such that compounds of formula IA are always at least twice as active as a mixture of the corresponding compounds of formulac IA and ID while the isomers of formulae IB and IC are only slightly active. Other medicinal uses to which compounds of formula I may be put are more fully explained in our earlier applications, the disclosures of which are to be understood to be incorporated herein by reference together with modes of administration and pharmaceutical compositions therefor. In addition to the above described effects t least some of the compounds of formula CI , notably compounds of formula IA , also exhibit a vasodilatory action on blood vessels, as described in the complete specification of our co pending UK patent applicationNo. 20694 78. There are often occasions when it wound be desirable to be able to utilise the anti aggregatory effects and the other effects described in our carlier applications while at the same time suppressing or eliminating the vasodilatory effect of the isomers of compounds of formula I , for example in the treatment or prevention of myocardial infarcts and when used as an addition in extra corporeal circulation. The anti aggregatory effects, but not the vasodilatory effects, of the active compounds are potentiated by chemical compounds exhibiting a particular pharmacological activity. This provides a means to dissociate the anti aggregatory effects from the vasodilatory effects of the compounds of formula I and notably the compounds of formula IA . Accordingly, a pharmaceutical combination which comprises an optical isomer of a compound of formula CI , notably a. compound of formula IA and a phosphodi esterase inhibitor promotes an anti aggregatory action on blood platelets. The use, in combination, of an optical isomer of a compound of formula I , notably a compound of formula IA , and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor lowers the anti aggregatory threshold level the minimum amount of active compound required to exhibit a lti aogrcgatoxy effccts without substantially affecting the vasodilatory threshold level. Thus, by administering an active compound at a concentration below its vasodilatory threshold level, but above the new, lower, anti aggregatory threshold, together th a phosphodiesterase inhibitor antiaggregatory effects may be produced whilst vasodilatory effects are not. Suitable phosphodiesterase inhibitors for use in potentiating the an.i aggregator effects of the active compounds include Yanthine derivatives such as Theophylline 3,7 dihydro 1,3 dimethyl 1H purine2,6 dione , and salts thereof 3 Isobutyl 1 methyl xanthine Caffeine 3,7 dihydro 1,3,7 trimethyl 1H purine2,6 dione ,and salts thereof and Aminophylline adduct of Theophylline and 1,2 ethanediamine 2 1 .

A particularly preferred combination is one comprising 5S 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3R 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyg hydantoin as compound of formula IA and dipyridamole as phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In this combination the dipyridamole has produced a potentation of the anti aggregatory effect of the active compound in aggregation tests on rabbits and in human platelet rich plasma. The amount of a compound of formula I required to achieve the desired biological effect will of course depend on a number of factors including the use for which it is intended, the mode of a 1millns tration, the recipient and the specific compound chosen. Examples of such doses are also given in our earlier applications but having regard to the largely increased activity of SS S 6 carboxyhexyl l 3R 3 cyclo hexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin over that expected and, bcnce, over that envisaged to be within the scope of our earlier applications, the appropriate dose for such active isomers would be reduced by a corresponding factor. More specifically, when such a compound of formula IA is used to inhibit platelet aggregation it is considered desirable to achieve a conccntration in the appropriate liquid, whether it be the blood of a patient or a perfusion fluid, in the range of from 0.25 pg to 2,5mg for example in the range of from 2.5 g to 0.25 mg per litre. The amount of isomer of a compound of formula I in such a combination required for therapeutic effect will vary not only with the particular compound and the route of administration but also with the particular phosphodiesterase inhibitor used and its a rount, 5. c with the degree of potentiation that occurs. The amount of the isomer will, however, be below that required to produce a given therapeutic effect in the absence of the potentiator and thus also below the level which would produce a significant vasodilatory effect. Where a phosphodiesterase inhibitor is used a suitable dose of compound of formula I will in general be half or, say, up to about 75t of the dose in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor potentiator. In general the compound of formula I and phosphodiesterase inhibitor are administered in a weight ratio of 1 part of the compound to from 1 to 200, preferably from 10 to 150, especially 40 to 100, e.g.60 parts of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. While it is possible for an isomer of a compound of formula I , notably, a compound of formula IA , and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to be administered as raw chemicals, it is preferable to present them as one or more pharmaceutical formulations. More specifically, when such a combination contains a compound of formula IA and is presentedasa phar na ceutical formulation, a unit dose of such a formulation may contain, for example, 75 mg of phosphodiesterase inhibitor and 1.25 rng of the compound of formula IA . The abovementioned doses of the active compounds refer to the acids, amides, esters, alcohols and tetrazoles of formula I where a salt is used, the dose should be taken as referring to the corresponding anion. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that what we shall claim may comprise any novel feature described herein, but principally and not exclusively, or example a a method for preparing four individual isomers of formula I , namely compounds of formula IA , IB , IC or ID as hereinabove described b a compound of formula IA , IIA , IIIA or IXA as hereinbefore defined when pre pared by the method as hereinabove described c a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a com pound of formula IA in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, and methods for tbe preparation of such formulations d a method for inhibiting platelet aggregation in a manuTtal which comprises administration to said mammal of a non toxic, effective, inhibitory amount of a compound of formula IA e a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a com pound of formula IA and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, and methods for the preparation of such formulations f a mct iod for inhibiting platelet aggregation in a mammal which comprises administration to said mam,nal of a non toxic, effective inhibitory amount of a compound of formula IA and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor g A method of lowering blood pressure in a mammal which comprises administration to sad mammal of a non toxic, effective, hypotensive amount of a compound of formula IA h A method for inducing vasodilation in a mammal which comprises administration to sa id mammal of a non toxic, effective vasodilatory amount of a compound of formula IA and i A method for inducing bronchodilation in a mammal which comprises administration to said mammal of a non toxic effective bronchodilatory amound of a compound of formula IA .
