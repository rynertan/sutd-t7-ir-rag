# Preparation of organic polymers.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of a variety of engineering polymers and copolymers, in particular aromatic polymers and copolymers, which comprises reacting a stannylated intermediate containing a first monomeric or polymeric moiety with a second compound, usually a di acid chloride containing a second monomeric or polymeric moiety. The intermediate and second compound react by way of a condensation reaction to elimnate the tin and polymerise together the first and second moieties. Some novel polymers and copolymers can be prepared using this method.
