# PLATE

## Abstract
A base plate exhibits an upward projecting peripheral rim and slots 3 standing on edge arranged in said rim. The plate consists of a first, preferably flat unit 1 executed in wood and a second component arranged next to it and executed in solid wood in the form of a composite frame in three or more parts 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d . Each part of the frame exhibits a high degree of drying and has been heat treated in such a way that the pith fibres of the wood are sealed by resin released from the wood. The surface of each part of the frame has also been treated with varnish or a similar substance which seals the surface pores of the wood. Each part of the frame is so arranged that the longitudinal direction of the wood coincides essentially with the height direction of the plate. A reinforcing element 2b prevents the occurance of any warping of the wood caused by internal stresses which may be present in the wooden material.
