## Description
METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING DECORATED PLATES PARTICULARLY FOR LAMPSHADES OR LUMINOUS ORNAMENTS, AND THE PLATES PRODUCED BY THE METHODLampshades are known of which the exposed surface is defined by the face of a metal sheet on which a finely perforated design is formed by any suitable incision method, preferably by chemical etching through the entire thickness of the sheet. At least one sheet of diaphanous material is fixed intimately and uniformly, by adhesives or any other suitable method, on to that side of the metal sheet which faces the light source.This method is described for example in French patents 2,181,252 Evangelisti and 2,381,239 HPW Herberger and in German patentOS 2,505,183 Schneider .According to French patent 2,381,239, the diaphanous part of the composite material can be in the form of one or more layers of cellulose paper which is sulphurised, bleached and soaked in phenolic resins, while the metal layer can be of copper or aluminium.The exposed side of the incised metal surface can be protected by a varnish which can also extend over the diaphanous zones which have become exposed by the incisions in the metal surface. Likewise, a protective varnish providing a smooth surface can be applied to the inner face of the decorated plate, namely that facing the light source.In German patent OS 2,505,183, the diaphanous material part is an epoxy resin layer, and the metal layer can be of copper, tin or steel. An additional coloured layer can be provided between the said metal layer and resin layer or on that side of this latter layer which faces the light source. This patent also states that filling layers, for example of a translucent or transparent colour, can be applied to the exposed cavities obtained by incising the metal layer, they being applied to either all the cavities or selectively. This patent also states that the metal surface decorated by incision can be electroplated, for example gold plated.French patent 2,181,252 is equivalent to the other aforesaid French patent. The methods described in all of these patents do not enable decorated plates to be formed which are of pleasant appearance when viewed on both their faces, as normally happens in the case of a lampshade, or able to withstand the high temperatures deriving from lighting lamps, or able to withstand bending stresses if formed into curved plates. The colouring method described in the said German patent cannot be implemented by industrial procedures, for example by silk screen printing, and does not enable the aforesaid object of giving the decorated plate a pleasant appearance on both its faces to be attained.The aforesaid patents therefore do not go beyond teaching the technique of decoration by chemical etching, and also have deficiencies and limits deriving from the choice of the material for forming the diaphanous layer, and where they provide for selective colouring of the diaphanous zones they use methods of poor aesthetic value which cannot be implemented by industrial procedures.To attain the objects of the invention, the most suitable material is that indicated in French patent 2,531,011 Thomson which describes the formation of decorated plates for lampshades or the like composed of a layer of glass fibre mixed with epoxy resin, and a thin copper layer which is incised for decorating purposes by chemical removal.This material is of the same type as that which is currently used in different thicknesses for making electronic printed circuits. This patent however also does not go beyond sum nary instructions on the decorative incision of the copper layer by a chemical method, and states that the thickness of the diaphanous layer lies between 0.1 and 0.2 mm, this not being suitable for the objects of the invention.The object of the present invention is to create a decorative plate of the aforesaid type, particularly for constructing lampshades, which has both its sides in the form of a reticulated metal decoration, of which the voids are occupied by a variously decorated diaphanous sheet.The invention therefore proposes a method for forming decorated plates for lampshades or for luminous ornaments, characterised by not only being finely incised but also finely decorated by methods which can be implemented on an industrial scale and such that the plates are practically identical when viewed on both their sides.A further object of the invention is to form decorated plates resistant to heat and to mechanical bending stresses, and which do not degrade under the action of light or chemical agents. A further object of the invention is to enable each decorated plate to be reproduced in an unlimited number of copies, always with precision and reproductive accuracy and at low cost. These and further objects have been attained by the following method, which is described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Plates of material known by the international symbols G 10 or FR 4 are employed, as used in the construction of electronic printed circuits and composed of a diaphanous layer of glass fabric and epoxy resins, and a thin layer of electrolytic copper, these plates having a thickness of between 0.2 and 1 mm and preferably of the order of 0.7 0.8 mm.The glass reinforced plastic layer of this material has the necessary mechanical bending strength and transparency for attaining the objects of the invention.It will be assumed that a decoration such as that illustrated inFigure 1 is to be formed. After selecting the design which is to appear on the final product in the form of a copper reticulation, a positive of said design is made on film as shown in Figure 1, and this positive is used to form a first frame for silk screen printing, which is permeable to ink at the dark zones of the design of Figure 1. A layer of protective varnish of the type normally used in chemical etching processes is spread over the metal face of the plate with this frame, in such a manner as to protect the copper corresponding to the dark parts of the design of Figure 1 but to leave the copper corresponding to the light zones of said design uncovered. Further reference zones indicated in Figure 1 by A A and C C C are also protected at the design on the same metal face of the plate.When the protective varnish has dried, those parts of the copper surface which have not been protected by the varnish are removed chemically. The plate leaves this stage with its copper surface incised in accordance with the design of Figure 1. Preferably, at least two copper strips S S are connected to the perimeter of the design, they being also protected from chemical attack and are able to connect together several decorations which may have been formed on one and the same plate. The use of the strips S S is described hereinafter in the description. In Figure 1, CU indicates the dark copper part, and VR indicates the glass reinforced plastic support. At this point the protective varnish is removed, and the plate is cleaned in order to prepare it for the subsequent stages. These consist of applying coloured designs to the perfectly flat rear face of the plate in the diaphanous zones thereof. After establishing which colours are to be applied to the various diaphanous zones of the glass reinforced plastic support VR, in accordance with the designs incised on the front part, transparent masks are constructed as illustrated for example by M1, M2 and M3 in Figures 2, 3 and 4.In order to construct these masks, a for example transparent film is superposed on the positive used for forming the design of Figure 1, the positive is reversed, and an opaque ink is used to firstly mark the reference signs A A and C C C on said film, after which those clear zones of the underlying design which are to receive one and the same colour are darkened. These masks can be prepared by a photomechanical method using lithography techniques with the required silk screen modifications, or alternatively they can be prepared manually and with a certain rapidity, in that high accuracy is not required in darkening said zones because, for the reasons given hereinafter, the darkening can also partly extend on to the underlying dark zones of the positive.The darkened zones of the masks ofFigures 2, 3 and 4 are intended to receive, for example, the three basic colours according to trichromatic theory. Thus in constructing these masks, account will be taken of the fact that one and the same zone can receive more than one main colour in order to obtain a derived colour. Likewise, account will be taken of the fact that the colouring Ean tan be either line or reticular. The masks M1, M2 and M3 are used to construct three silk screen frames which are permeable to ink in the part corresponding to the dark zones of the masks. After correctly centering the silk screen frames on the plate to be decorated, using for this purpose the reference signsA A which exist both on the plate and on the frame, the different colours are applied in the correct succession to the plate, and will also be visible by transparency on the front face of the plate through the diaphanous zones which are not covered by the copper decorationCU. The colouring is done preferably using light, transparent dyes suitable for polychrome silk screen processes and which bond to the glass reinforced plastic on which they are deposited. This latter condition is satisfied by subjecting the plate to suitable heat treatment, for example in ventilated antidust ovens, after each colouring.During this treatment, temperatures of the order of 600C can be attained for times of the order of a few minutes. The inks used for colouring are resistant to light, chemical agents and heat, and resist cleaning both by alcohol and by conventional detergents.After the stage involving the rear colouring of the diaphanous spaces, as stated heretofore, a silk screen frame is constructed using the reversed positive employed for obtaining the design of Figure 1, so that said frame is permeable to ink at the dark zones of said positive. With this frame, conveniently centered by the signs A A , a metal pigmentation covering ink is applied to the rear face of the plate, this ink reproducing as closely as possible the colour which the incised metallic face CU of the product will have on termination of the cycle. If this face is to be of gold colour, the said covering ink will be of rich gold colour.The decoration formed from the said covering ink will mirror the front metallic decoration on the product and will be extremely accurate by virtue of the fact that the relative silk screen frame has been formed from an extremely accurate positive, it thus performing two functions, namely to reproduce on the glass reinforced plastic surface a design equal to the external metal design and of very similar colour, and to cover any perimetral irregularities of the zones of different colour formed in the previous stages, thus providing boundary regularity between said zones. After forming the said decoration, the plate is subjected to heat treatment necessary for fixing the decoration. In this stage, temperatures of the order of 600C can be reached for times of a few minutes.Not all the diaphanous zones need necessarily be completely covered, and some of these zones can completely or partly preserve their original appearance. ii7en the decoration of the rear face of the plate has been completed, the decoration is protected by a transparent varnish which is fixed by heat treatment. During this stage, temperatures of the order of 80 C can be reached for times of a few minutes.All the inks and varnishes used in the said method are non flammable, so as to increase the heat resistance of the final product.At this point, the plate is prepared for the subsequent stages. The incised metallic surface is firstly perfectly cleaned and made bright or satiny according to appearance requirements. The plate is then electroplated to coat the incised metal surface, usually by goldplating. This stage rakes use of the strips S S of Figure 1, to which the electrodes of the electroplating plant are connected, so that the entire incised metallic design is uniformly treated, by being protected from direct contact with said electrodes. This also means that the rear metallic pigmentation decorationtdescribed heretofore is perfectly isolated from the electric current circuit and thus remains in its original condition. If it were to be exposed to electrolytic action, this decoration could become damaged.In order to ensure that the electroplating is uniform, the design formed on the metal surface CU must be composed of sign like fragments which are all linked together so as to be able to be reached by the electric current. Again for this purpose, as shown in Figure 1, it is preferable for the design to be bounded by a continuous line of suitable width, which is useful as a collector for the electric current. The strips S S are preferably covered with a suitable varnish so as to be protected from gold plating.After the gold plating stage, the plate is cleaned and the gold plated metal surface is protected by a transparent varnish which also extends to the diaphanous zones of the plate and is fixed by suitable heat treatment. At this point, holes are formed through the plate at the circles C C C so as to be able to correctly position the decorated and coloured part of the plate on the centering pins provided on the shearing equipment which is used to remove the decorated and coloured piece from the plate. Other methods can be used instead of shearing, for example cutting by laser beam. During the shearing stage or afterwards, suitably distributed perimetral holes F are provided in the decorated and coloured piece in the correct number for fixing the piece to other equal pieces or to interposed structures for support and shaping purposes if said pieces are to be kept in a flexed state.Figures 5 and 6 show a piece different from that of Figures 1 to 4 but decorated and coloured by the aforesaid method, the figures showing the metal face and the glass reinforced mastic face respectively. In these figures, the reference letter R indicates the line formation made by the metallic pigientation covering ink. Certain modifications can be made to the described method. The electroplating of the incised metallic part can for example be effected during the initial stages of the method before the silk screen decoration stages, with all the modifications which this difference involves, including the matter of transparent masks. This and all modifications apparent to the expert of the art fall within the scope of the invention as heretofore described and illustrated, and claimed hereinafter.In the claims given hereinafter, the purpose of the references given in parentheses is only to facilitate their reading, and must in no way be interpreted as limitative of the scope of protection of said claims.
