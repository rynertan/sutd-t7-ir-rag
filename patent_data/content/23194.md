## Description
A process for manufacturing coating, panels, and panels obtained with such processThis invention relates to a process for manufacturing coating panels in which the surface designed to face outwardly presents at least one generally recessed area which for aesthetic reasons is characterized by a different shade and degree of surface finish with respect to the shade and surface finish of the remaining area of the aforemen tioned external surface said invention is also concerned with the panels obtained employing said process. Recent market research has shown that the clientele doesn t appreciate in any special way the aesthetic look of panels presenting the same shade on the entire surface designed to face outwardly.In order to overcome such drawback, the manufacturers have produced panels characterized as follows the surface designed to face outwardly is composed of an outside area comprising the arm rest and the handle coated with a waterproof synthetic resin sheet e.g.leatherette of an established colour, while the remaining portion of same is coated with a thin sheet of material erg, velvet .Hence the problem arises of having to attach the sheet of material to the underlying synthetic resin sheet through bonding agents or seams, but both solutions present a number of drawbacks both from the aesthetic and the functional points of view.The former solution, in fact, doesn t provide for a gap between the sheet of material and the underlying leatherette surface onto which the sheet of material is glued furthermore, the sheet of material tends to come off as it wears.The latter solution entails the employment of considerable labour and power consuming machines for the execution of the seams while this has a negative effect on the cost of the panel, it doesn t even gna rantee the achievement of the desired geometry in regard to the se paration line between the resin sheet and the material, also because the areas in which the seams are to be executed are generally concave.In order to overcome the above problems, the Applicant has devised a manufacturing process by which it is possible to obtain coating panels in which the surface designed to face outwardly presents at least two separate areas, a first area of which generally recessed with respect to the other is entirely contained in and circumscribed by the second area, said areas being produced in pre established shades and degrees of surface finish, being separated by a continuous line developing according to a predetermined geometry, and being defined by two sheets of any material whatsoever, or by a sheet and a rigid lamina, both made of any material whatever.The above is attained through this invention which relates to a process for manufacturing coating panels of the type presenting, on the surface designed to face outwardly, at least two distinct areas, a first area of which is entirely contained in and circumscribed by the second area, said process entailing the employment of a die counterdie unit for the moulding of a corresponding panel, in which the surface of the die defines the surface of the panel which is designed to face outwardly and is provided with a relief the perimetral top edge of which develops perfectly in accordance with the correspond ing closed line delimiting the aforementioned first area, and entail ing, furthermore, the preliminary execution of a practically flat con ponentt the perimetral development of which contains the perimetral development of the edge of the head of said relief, and the external front surface of which is designed to identify with the surface of said first area said process being characterized by the fact that it entails the following stages a laying of said component into a complementary seat produced in the head of said relief so as to match its external front surface with the surface of said seat and, furthermore, so as to allow the edge of said component to protrude with respect to the perimetral edge of the abovementioned head b laying of a sheet onto the internal front surface of said compo nent, onto the edge of the component itself and onto that portion of the surface of the die which defines the second area of the pa nel surface designed to face outwardly c closing of the die counterdie unit with the subsequent pressure injection of synthetic resin into the hollow space defined by said sheet and by the surface of the counterdie, and subsequent opening of said unit after a definite time, drawing the moulded panel from same.In a second en,bodiment, the aforementioned process which entails the employment of a die whose surface defines the surface of the panel which is designed to face outwardly, is endowed with said relief fulfilling the abovementioned conditions and ist furthermore, endowed with suction units is characterized by the fact that it comprises a laying of said component into a complementary seat produced in the head of said relief so as to match its external front surface with the surface of said seat and, furthermore, so as to allow the edge of said component to protrude with respect to the perimetral edge of the abovementioned head b laying of a thermoformable material Blab, which is made to rest on the die and on the internal front surface of said component c heating of said thermoformable slab at a definite temperature d actuation of the aforementioned suction units in order to achieve the permanent set of the above slab, by using said units to keep it adherent to the internal front surface of said component, to the edge of same and to the remaining surface of the die for such amount of time as is required by the slab to reach perma nent hardening.In order to point out some further characteristics and advantages of this invention, some illustration is supplied hereunder regarding five preferred embodiments of the coating panels obtained through the first embodiment of the process under discussion, and one further panel obtained through the second embodiment of said process, said panels being illustrated by way of example not as a restriction, in the enclosed drawings where figure 1 gives a cross sectional view of a portion of the die coun terdie unit with the interposed panel, executed according to the first embodiment of the process under discussion, at the level of the separation line between the two areas of the panel having dif ferent shades and different degrees of surface finish figure 2 supplies the same view of the portion of panel shown in figure 1, the panel having been drawn from the die counterdie u nit figures 3, 4, 5 6 illustrate Just as many variations of the panel shown in figure 2, all of which can be obtained with the first em bodiment of the process under discussion figure 7 is a perspective view of a coating panel obtained with the first embodiment of the process under discussion figure8 8a4 8b, 8c1 illustrate schematically the stages which are to be followed when manufacturing a panel a portion of which can be seen in figure 8b by means of the second embodiment of the pro cess under discussion.With reference to figure 7, 1 has been adopted to rark a panel obtained through the first embodiment of the process under discussion, desired to line a corresponding door in psrticulart the rear door of a motor vehicle . The coating of the surface of said panel designed to face outwardly is executed by means of a synthetic resin sheet 2 edges leatherette and a sheet of material 3 e.g. velvet , the latter covering for obvious aesthetic reasons the bottom of a recessed area 6 produced in said surface sheets 2 and 3 are separated by a line 7 which de velops according to a predetermined line in this particular case co inciding with the internal bottom edge of recessed area 6 . The amanufacture of panel 1 according to the first embodiment of the process under discussion, entails the employment of a unit 10 made up of a die 11 and its relative counterdie 12. Surface 21 of die 11 defines surface la of the panel, which is design ed to face outwardly in view of the above, said surface 21 presents a relief 14 defining the aforementioned recessed area 6, i.e. the first area of the panel surface 22 of counterdie 12 defines surface 1b of the panel, which is designed to face inwardly. The process under discussion entails the preliminary manufacture of a component 4 which, in the first embodiment figs. 1, 2 is made up of a metal lamina 5 which constitutes the carrying framework of the corn ponent a layer 8 made of elastic material yielding to the touch e. g. soft polyurethane and coating sheet 3 e.g. velvet . The abovementioned component is manufactured according to known tech niques, while edges 3a, sa of sheet 3 and lamina 5 respectively are compressed strongly and simultaneously bent e.g. through a drawing process as is kshown in figures 1 and 2, so as to achieve the inter locking of said edges. The perimetral development of component 4 is practically similar to the perimetral development of the head of relief 14 of die 11, but its area exceeds that of the above head the reason for this will be made clear later on moreover, the external surface of sheet 3 ex eluding edge 3a defines the outline of the bottom of the aforemen tioned recessed area 6. The process under discussion entails the following stages in order to manufacture panel 1 a laying of component 4 into a complementary seat 14a produced in the head of relief 14 so as to match the external surface of sheet 3 or the external front part of component 1 with the surface of seat 14a4 and furthermore, so as to allow the edge 4a of said com ponent to protrude with respect to the perimetral edge 14b of said head b laying of sheet 2 so as to make it adhere to the internal front part of component 4 i.e., touching metal lamina 5 , to the strip of said component circumscribing the abovementioned seat 14a, to the side surface of said relief and to the portion of surface 21 of die 11 defining the second area of surface la of the panel, which is designed to face outwardly.c Closing of the die counterdie unit and subsequent pressure inJec tion of synthetic resin e.g. polyurethane foam into hollow space 15 defined by sheet 2 and surface 22 of counterdie 12. The e ansion reaction of the polyurethane foam brings about an approxi mately even pressure all around sheet 2 this leads said sheet to adhere perfectly to the internal front part of component 4 i.e. lamina 5 , to edge 4a of said component 4 in portion 2a and to surface 21 of die 11 defining the aforementioned second area of the panel. The hardening of the foam, which follows its expansion phase, stabilizes the abovementioned situation and leads further more, to the formation of the carrying, framework of the panel coin ciding with said hollow space 15. After a certain time which is necessary in order to accomplish the abovementioned reactions said unit is opened, and panel 1 obtained through the above stages is drawn from the unit itself.The carrying framework of the panel thus obtained consists of the rigid polyurethane, the volune of which coincides with the volume of Mid haIlcw space 15 the mould ing operation produced an undercut seat or grooves 15a in the a bove framewsork, in which edge 4a of component 4 is stably embedded with portion 2a of sheet 2 in other words, the abovementioned ed ges 5a, 3a are tightly embedded in said groove this prevents sheet 3 from sliding with regard to sheet 2, the latter being in tegral with the corresponding portion of the carrying framework of the panel.The second embodiment of the process under discussion requires the employment of a die 111 the surface of which 121 defines the two abovementioned areas of the panel composing the surface of the panel which is designed to face outwardly hence die 111 is endowed with relief 14 fulfilling the conditions specified under the first embodiment of the process moreover, the portion of the die defining said second area presents holes 115, which are connected to currently known types of suction units, not shown in the figures.The second embodiment of said process entails stages a b f c , d listed hereunder, stage a of which is equal to the corresponding stage in the first embodiment.Stage b entails the laying of a slab 1162 made of thermoformable material, onto the die and onto the internal front surface of said com ponent 4. Stage c entails the heating of said slab 116 by means of a known type of heat source not illustrated , reaching a temperature capable of softening the slab itself.Stage d entails the operation of the abovementioned suction units this leads to the permanent set of slab 116 which is sucked fig. 8c so as to adhere to the internal front surface of component 4 to edge 4a of this same component and to the remaining surface of die 111 said suction units keep on orating for such an amount of time as is necessary for the slab to harden.The internal surface 116a of slab 116 may be coupled in accordance with known technology with a soft polyurethane layer 117 both components making up a panel 118 a portion of which can be seen in fi gtzre Sd. Slab 116 constitutes the carrying framework of panel 118, defines the external surface of the panel which is not connected to component 4 or second area , and furthermore forms an undercut groove 120 in which edge 4a of component 4 is stably F embedded.A considerable advantage of panele 1, 118 obtained through the two embodiments of the process under discussion respectively, is supplied by the fact that edge 4a of component 4 is embedded in a groove 15a, 120 res ctively which extends along a plane which is parallel to the surface of greatest development of said component in other words, the anchorage of edge 4a to the carrying framework 15 of panel 1 or to slab 116 of panel 118 respectively, is executed in a lateral direction with regard to component 4.The above makes it possible to reduce first embodiment the thickness S of the carrying framework touching metal lamina 5 this does not affect the mechanical resistance of panel 1 in such area since compe nent 4 is strengthened by lamina 5 such feature is of material importance in view of a reduction in depth of the panel, the bottom boundary of which in the portion enclosing recessed area 6 corresponds to the san of the depth of said recess Erd the thickness of component 4 the same applies to thickness S of layer 120 relative to panel 118. Cczponent 4 may also be manufactured without layer 8 figure 3 1 or may be made up of a small wooden board 25 or someother suuicient ly rigid material which is both a carrying structure and an ornamen tal device fig. 4 . In other two variations, component 4 s J structure is composed of a metal ring 35 figure 5 the perimetral development of which contains the perimetral development of said seat 14a similarly, the yield ing elastic layer 8 figure 6 may be eliminated. It is understood that the foregoing description, which has been supplied by way of example and is in no way restrictive upon the invention, may be changed, altered or combined, without however exceeding the boundaries protecting this invention as described above and claims ed hereunder.
