# Phosphinic acid derivatives and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a novel process for preparing 3 amino 3 carboxy propyl 1 phosphinic acid derivatives, comprising reacting an alkylalkylphosphonyl halide with a vinylmagne sium halide to form a vinylphosphinic acid derivative, and reacting the vinylphosphinic acid derivative with a Shiff s base to form the aimed product. Also disclosed is a novel intermediate compound formed during the course of the above process, which compound has the general formula
