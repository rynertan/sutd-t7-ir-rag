# Transmitter assembly for a telephone handset.

## Abstract
A transmitter assembly for a telephone set uses a commer ciaily available cartridge electret transmitter, by modifying the response curve. This is obtained by an adapter housing the transmitter with a first volume defined between the end of the transmitter and the end of the bore in which the transmitter fits. At the end of the bore there is an end wall with a hole therethrough, the hole covered with a layer of acoustic resistance material. A second volume is formed on the other side of the end wall, by a hollow formation on the wall of the transmitter housing of the handset. A slot is formed in the transmitter housing wall within the formation. The first volume provides damping, the hole and acoustic resistance material provides dB limitation at a particular frequency 1000Hz and the second volume and slot provide resonance at a second frequency 3000 Hz .
