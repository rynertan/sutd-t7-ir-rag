## Description
Field of the inventionThis invention relates to a novel polypropylene resin composition useful for thin wall injection moldingDescription of the prior artA polypropylene resin has been widely used for producing containers, as it is light in weight and has good stiffness, heat resistance and moldability.Recently, upon those good characteristics, thinwall containers by injection molding has been prevalent especially in the field of food packaging. A grade of resin called a high flow grade is usually used in said field in order to achieve high productivity.However, there have been such disadvantages among those known grades of polypropylene resin that 1 resulting moldings frequently do not have good flatness because of sink marks in the end part of the moldings, which is caused by molding polypropylene, which is essentially a crystalline resin, in high speed molding to obtain thin wall moldings, and 2 stringiness and cracks tend to occur around the gates because of inferior moldability in the gate part, which bring about bad finish. The finish of the flat part of the moldings is quite important for the fitting and sealing with caps in packaging containers.The finish around the gate is also practically quite important not only in appearance but also in strength during the practical use of the moldings.Though these drawbacks can be avoided by some changes of the molding conditions, such changes always cause a deterioration in the productivity.For instance, an elevation of the injection pressure so as to improve flatness causes an increase of flash or a bad release of the moldings according to the adhesion on the core of the mold. Further, a lowering of resin temperature so as to avoid stringiness causes microcracks.Thus, a resin having a totally good molding characteristics has long been expected in the field.It has been known that such finish concerning flatness as sink mark can be improved to some extent by blending a nucleating agent.However, it has not been a substantial improving method because a necessary injection pressure must be raised in order to compensate the lowering of resin flowability in the mold caused by the blending and it,also causes bad release.Summary of the inventionThe present invention relates to a polypropylene resin composition, which comprises containing a an amide of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and b an aromatic carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof.Brief description of the inventionIn the present invention, an amide of an aliphatic carboxylic acid can be an amide of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid amide, stearic acid amide, erucic acid amide, etc., which has a melting point ranging from 60 to 110 C. If the melting point is higher than 1100C, the amide does not sufficiently bleed on the surface of the resin because of a bad co solubility with polypropylene.If the melting point is lower than 60 C, too much amount of bleed comes out to cause smears on the surface of the mold.The amide of an aliphatic carboxylic acid is usually blended at a ratio ranging from 0.01 to l, preferably from 0.05 to 0.5 by weight to the polypropylene resin.Aromatic carboxylic acid can be an acid having the structure with carboxyl group bonding directly to aromatic nuclei such as benzoic acid, p toluic acid, o toluic acid, pisopropyl benzoic acid, p tert butyl benzoic acid, o tertbutyl benzoic acid chlorbenzoic acid, hydroxy benzoic acid, nitro benzoic acid, etc. or a carboxylic acid having a nuclei in the molecule such as monophenyl acetic acid, diphenyl acetic acid, etc.Further, polycarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and trimeritic acid, etc.can be used.The derivatives of aromatic carboxylic acid can be a metal salt and an anhydride. The metalic salt can be litium salt, sodium salt, magnesium salt, potassium salt, barium salt, aluminum salt, titanium salt or chromium salt. The anhydride can be phthalic anhydride, trimeritic anhydride, etc.The aromatic acid or the derivatives thereof is usually blended to the polypropylene resin by an amount ranging from 0.01 to 1, preferably from 0.05 to 0.58 by weight.These ingredients can be blended to polypropylene by a known method. For instance, they can be mixed with polypropylene by being added to the polypropylene powder or pellet and successively supplied to an extruder, a Banbury mixer, a Kneader, a mixing roll, etc. They can also be supplied as a master batch with a resin to a molding machine to be blended.A polypropylene used in this invention can be a homopolypropylene having a 89 or more, preferably 93 or more,Isotactic Index II the extract residue obtained by extracting resin with boiling n hexane by Soxhlet extractor for 6 hours, which is shown by by weight , ablock polypropylene or a random polypropylene co polymerized with up to 10 by weight of other a olefines, or mixtures thereof.The Melt Flow Index MFI of the polypropylene is preferably in the range of from 15 to 60. If it is lower than 15, handling is difficult because of lower flowability and if higher than 60, the impact strength of the moldings decreases. A homo polypropylene having an MFI of from 15 to 40 or a propylene copolymer having an MFI of from 20 to 60 are especially useful.The polypropylene composition of this invention can be optionally blended with usually used additives such as an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorbing agent, an antistatic agent, a lubricant, a pigment, etc.The polypropylene composition of this invention has an excellent flowability and moldability, and the moldings obtained has excellent appearance.Thus, the composition is industrially quite useful for thin wall injection molding.The thin wall moldings of this invention means a moldings which satisfy the following conditions, t 0.1 l t1.6 250 l t1.6 300, preferably wherein t is a wall thickness of the molding and above equations are those in the case that the distance between the gate and the end of the flow is 1 cm. The high speed molding of this invention means a condition in which light weight packages defined above are molded in a molding speed of more than 250 shots per hour, preferably 300 shots per hour. The present invention is further described by the following examples, but they are not shown for restricting the invention.The molding conditions and the methods for testing the moldings are shown below.A.
