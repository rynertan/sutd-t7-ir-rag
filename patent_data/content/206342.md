# Ceramics binder and production of ceramics articles.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a ceramics binder comprising an organic binding agent and adamantane and or trimethylene norbor nane as a binding auxiliary, and a method for producing a ceramics article comprising mixing a ceramics raw material powder with a ceramics binder comprising an organic bind ing agent and adamantane and or trimethylenenorbornane as a binding auxiliary, molding the resulting mixture by an injection molding method or an extrusion molding method to obtain a molded article, and sintering the molded article. When the ceramics binder is used in a dough for injection molding, the time required for eliminating the ceramics binder can be shortened and the content of the ceramics binder which remains in the molded articles after eliminat ing treatment can be reduced to a negligibly low level.
