# Fastener for channeled structural members.

## Abstract
A fastener 10 for attaching fixtures to channeled structural members 20 has an extended bolt engag ing section 330 which increases the load carrying capacity of the fastener 10 . The fastener 10 , with the extended section 340 , can be used in channeled structural members 20 of limited depth as well as the standard channeled structural members without sacrificing the load carrying capacity. The extended section 340 has an alignment feature which will align the flanges 70, 80 of the channeled structural member 20 with the grooved flange engaging means 280, 290 of the fastener 10 permitting the use of the fastener 10 in channeled structural members 20 having widths greater than standard members.
