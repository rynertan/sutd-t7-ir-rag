# Picture frame.

## Abstract
A picture frame 10 comprises a thin sheet of material having a first slot 11 for retaining a picture and a second slot 12 which defines a portion 17 which can be bent relative to the rest of the frame to constitute a support. The slot 11 extends along three edges of the frame alternatively two slots 31a, 31b extend along opposite edges of the frame. The sheet material is resilient so that inner and outer portions 16, 15 are resiliently biassed to a coplanar position.

## Description
PICTURE FRAMEThe present invention relates to a frame for mounting a picture or the like, e.g. a photograph or a card, which does not necessarily incorporate pictorial matter.From GB.416,150 there is known an arrangement for mounting photographs, postcards and the like in which a sheet of cardboard is provided with four corner slots to retain an inserted photograph and a further slot which can be bent relative to the rest of the sheet to provide a support for the mount. This disclosure corresponds to the introductory part of claim 1.The present invention seeks to provide an improved mounting arrangement for pictures, photographs and the like.According to the present invention there is provided a frame for mounting a picture or the like comprising a thin sheet of material having first slot means through the material of the sheet and arranged to receive and hold edges of an inserted picture or the like and second slot means arranged to define a portion of the sheet which can be bent relative to the rest of the sheet to provide a support for the frame, characterised in that the first slot means is defined by one or more slots extending substantially along the whole length of one or more edges of the frame. An advantage of this is that a picture frame complete with support member is formed from a single sheet of material. The slots may be formed by a simple stamping operation.Furthermore there is a range of sizes of the picture which can be accommodated by each frame. The dimensions of the picture are not strictly limited as with conventional mounting arrangements. Moreover, if trimming of the picture is necessary, any untidy trimmed edges may be concealed by the outer portion of the frame.In addition there is the possibility of moving around a picture within the frame to highlight a desired part.The frame also permits the provision of a decorative framing edge for the picture.The first slot preferably defines inner and outer parts of the frame and the material of the sheet may be resilient so that the inner and outer parts are resiliently biassed towards a coplanar position.An advantage of this is that no special catch or other means is needed to hold together the inner and outer parts and thus to retain a picture etc in position.Because the frame is of thin sheet material, the picture is not damaged by being caught between the edges of the inner and outer frame parts. When bending the support portion relative to the rest of the frame, the elastic limit of the material at the connection of the support is passed so that the support remains in its bent out position. The frame is preferably made of a sheet of metal, for example brass. An advantage of this is that material may be selectively removed from the outer frame part to give a decorative effect without impairing the rigidity of the frame.The first slot means may be defined by a single continuous slot or by two generally parallel slots.The second slot means preferably comprises a single generally U shaped slot which defines a tab portion which can be bent out of the plane of the rest of the sheet to define a support for the frame.Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 shows a front view of a frame in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 shows a schematic side view of the frame ofFig. 1 Fig. 3 shows a front view of a frame in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 shows a front view of a frame in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 5 shows a schematic side view of the frame ofFig. 4.Referring now to the drawings Figs. 1 and 2 show a frame 10 comprising a metal sheet. The sheet is cut or stamped to from a generally arch shaped first slot 11 and a generally U shaped second slot 12. This divides the sheet into an outer portion 15, an intermediate portion 16 and a portion 17 which , as shown in Fig. 2 is bent out of the plane of the rest of the sheet to form a rearwardly extending support for the frame.Selected parts of the outer portion 15 are removed to provide a pattern giving a decorative effect. The outer portion 15 serves as a frame around a picture not shown inserted into the gap 18 formed between portions 15 and 16. The shape of slot 11 determines which part of the picture is visible from the front and which parts are concealed behind portion 15. The size of gap 18 is exaggerated in Fig. 2 in practice portion 15 and 16 are substantially coplanar. In use the frame is positioned with the bottom of outer portion 15 and the bottom of support portion 17 resting on a generally flat surface.Fig. 3 shows a metal frame 20 in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention having a first slot 21 having sections which define substantially three sides of a rectangle. The slot 21 defines an outer frame portion 25 and an intermediate portion 26. A second slot 22 defines a support 27 for the frame. A side view of frame 20 would be substantially identical to Fig. 2.Fig. 4 shows a metal frame 30 in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. The first slot of the previous embodiments is replaced by two oppositely facing and generally parallel slots 31a, 31b. A generally U shaped slot 32 is also provided.The slots divide the sheet into an outer portion 35, an intermediate portion 36 and support portion 37. Selected parts of the outer portion 35 are removed to provide a pattern giving a decorative effect. The ends of slots 31a, 31b are also shaped to give a decorative effect. The outer portion 35 serves as a frame around a picture not shown inserted sideways into slots 31a, 31b. The separation of portions 35 and 36 is slightly exaggerated in Fig. 5 in practice the portions are substantially coplanar.Various modifications can be made to the above described embodiments. Although the frames are preferably made of metal, they may alternatively be made of plastics such as P.V.C., card or any other suitable material. In each case the material is preferably resilient so that the parts defining the first slot are resiliently biassed towards a coplanar position. When forming the slots it is optional whether material is removed from the frame. The shape of the slots may be selected as desired. Besides or as well as being patterned by removal of material, the outer portion may be coloured. Although in the above described embodiments the hinge or connection portion of the support 17,27,37 has been at the top, it can alternatively be provided at the bottom. In this case the support is bent substantially perpendicular to the rest of the frame. If desired portions 15,16 and 25,26 could be connected together at the top instead of at the bottom.
