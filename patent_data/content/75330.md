# A NAIL DRIVER

## Abstract
A nail driver of simple construction having a magnet in the interior of a housing and cover which constitutes the handle and a soft steel rod attached to said magnet and extending into a tubular bushing which is adapted to slide in a barrel like extension and projects beyond it, the bushing being urged into projected position by a spring, so that where a nail is inserted head first into the bushing and the free end of the latter is placed against the place where the nail is to be driven, the force on the handle will retract the bushing into said extension so that the nail will become exposed to be driven home.
