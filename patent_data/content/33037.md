# Heterojunction semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A thin electron accumulation layer is generated along a heterojunction between two different semiconductor layers 21,22 each of which has a different electron affinity from the other. This electron accumulation suffers a less ionized impurity scattering, because its thickness does not exceed the spread of an electron wave. A channel constituted by this electron accumulation enjoys an excellent magnitude of elec tron mobility particularly at cryogenic temperature. A layer configuration fabricated with two different semiconductors 21, 22 having different electron affinity from, and similar crystal lattice coefficient with, each other and interleaving a single heterojunction therein is effective to improve the elec tron mobility. Such a layer configuration can be employed for production of an active semiconductor device with high elec tron mobility, resulting in a high switching speed. Such semi conductor devices, including an FET, CCD et al, exhibit an excellent transfer conductance Gm, and may be constructed in a number of ways.
