# AUTOMATIC OPTICAL INSPECTION APPARATUS

## Abstract
An automatic optical inspection method apparatus wherein optical preprogramming means are utilized to designate the locations of reference features on a reference object, and to instruct the system regarding the reference feature characteristics, and of reference feature parameters, the automatic optical inspection apparatus is then utilizing information obtained from the optical pre programming means to analyze image data obtained from objects under inspection, the apparatus initially obtaining a larger amount of optical imaging data and systematically thereafter reduc ing the quantity of such data by appropriate signal proces sing and gating, so that an accept or reject decision is based upon a small portion of the originally obtained data.
