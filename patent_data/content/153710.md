# Novel toxoids of elastase of pseudomonas aeruginosa origin.

## Abstract
The subject matter of the invention are two novel toxoids of elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa origin, one of which is obtained by treating a purified elastase produced from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the synthetic peptide chloroacetyl N hydroxy L leucyl L alanylglycinamide. The other is obtained by treating purified elastase first with formalin and then with the synthetic peptide. The present invention also discloses a method for preparing the toxoids and the use of such toxoids for preventing and treating infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in human beings and mammalian animals.
