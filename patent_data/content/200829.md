# Hydraulic type starting clutch.

## Abstract
A hydraulic type starting clutch having an input rotating member 5 rotatable in unison with an input shaft 2 , an output rotating member 6 rotatable in unison with an out put shaft 4 , and friction plates 21, 27 interposed between the input and output rotating members and adapted to trans mit torque from the input rotating member to the output rotating member when engaged. An urging member 20 urges the friction plates to cause transmission of torque from the input rotating member to the output rotating mem ber, and a hydraulic pressure chamber 22 is defined be tween the urging member and the output rotating member and supplied with a hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic fluid source. A control device controls a pressure regulating valve 10 in a manner such that the pressure in the hydrau lic pressure chamber is regulated to values dependent upon the rotational speed of the input shaft.
