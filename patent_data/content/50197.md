## Description
DEVICE AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING PNEUMATIC TIRES HAVING PRESELECTED NOISE CHARACTERISTICS TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to pneumatic tires. More particularly, the present invention pertains to noise generated by pneumatic tires as they rotate and engage a road surface. Still more specifically, the present invention contemplates a device and method which produces a tread element design for pneumatic tires that generates a preselected audio frequency spectrum as it engages a road surface. BACKGROUND ART As a tire rotationally engages a roadway its individual tread design elements cause disturbances in surrounding air molecules, generating sounds in the audio frequency spectrum. The geometry of the individual tread design elements, coy only known as pitches or pitch elements, has been found to control those specific frequencies at which sounds are generated and the relative energy content i.e., amplitude of each such frequency. Where pitches of constant dimensions have been used to completely surround a pneumatic tire, the majority of the energy occurs at a single resonant frequency and harmonics of that frequency. This tonal concentration is highly disturbing to the occupants of the vehicle on which the tire is mounted. Efforts along two basic lines have been taken to ameliorate the objectionable noise generated by rotating pneumatic tires. Some have attempted to modulate deleterious noise producing frequencies by sequencing pitch elements randomly or in accordance with preselected algebraic or trigonometric relations. For example, in the publication Quieting Noise Mathematically Its Application to Snow Tires S.A.E. Paper No. 690520 a mathematical method is disclosed for modifying the location of particular tread elements to more uniformly distribute audio noise throughout the frequency spectrum. Others have varied the pitch lenyths on individual pitch elements again in a random or preselected algebraic or trigonometric manner.Most recently work has been done in simultaneously utilizing both techniques, as exemplified by Great BritainPatent Application No. 2,014,520A and U.S. Patent No.3,926,238. The principal deficiency of the prior art has been the necessity for design by trial and error. Heretofore a tread pattern had to be, built and tested before its exact noise characteristics were known. Indeed, in Åa very recent U.S. Patent, No. 4,178,199, the method used to reduce the amount of noise generated by a particular tread pattern required comparison to a tread pattern whose audio excitation freeluencies were previously ascertained. In short, there does not appear to exist any device or method for obtaining the tread pattern required to generate a preselected audio output spectrum. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is, therefore, an advantage of the invention to provide a device and method for obtaining a tread pattern for a pneumatic tire which minimizes acoustic noise in a preselected fashion. It is a further advantage of the invention to provide a device and method, as above, in which a tread pattern having preselected noise characteristics may be obtained without empirical testing and trial and error procedures. It is still a further advantage of the invention to provide a device and method, as above, in which specific lengths are ascertained for individual pitch elements to generate the preselected noise characteristics. These and other features and advantages of the present invention over existing prior art forms will become more apparent and fully understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In general, the present invention contemplates a device for producing a design element pattern of a preselected total length for a load supporting apparatus, the apparatus having a preselected, periodic audio frequency sLJectrulul signal, and tlle desiyii elullent pattern including a plurality of individual design elelllellts of varyiny lengths.The device includes a generator for generating the preselected audio frequency spectrum signal, an inverseFourier transformer receiving the preselected, periodic audio frequency spectrum signal and generating an inverseFourier transform signal thereof, and a processing circuit receiving the inverse Fourier transform signal and generating a periodic signal the period of which is proportional to the preselected total length for the design element pattern and the relative amplitude of which at various points in time throughout one period is proportional to the length of the individual design elements at similarly spaced locations over the preselected total length for the design element pattern. The present invention also contemplates a method for generating a design element pattern of a preselected total length for a load supporting apparatus, the apparatus having a preselected, periodic audio frequency spectrum signal, and the design element pattern including a plurality of individual design elements of varying lengths.The method includes the steps of generating the preselected audio frequency spectrum signal, generating an inverseFourier transform signal of the preselected, periodic audio frequency spectrum signal, and, proportionally adjusting the inverse Fourier transform signal such that its signal has a period proportional to the preselected total length for the design element pattern and has a relative amplitude at various points in time throughout one period that is proportional to the length of the individual design elements at similarly spaced locations over the preselected total length for the design element pattern.

Fig. 3 is a partial tread pattern showing individual design elements of varying lengths. Fig. 4 is a schematic representation of the actual audio frequency spectrum signal obtained by the disclosed exemplary device in the example set forth below. PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 1 illustrates a device generally indicated by the numeral 10, which also embodies a method for producing a tread pitch pattern for a pneumatic tire having a preselected, periodic audio frequency spectrum signal. Device 10 broadly includes output spectrum generator 11, fast Fourier transformer 12, and processing circuit 13. Output spectrum generator 11 may be any device or circuit which generates a periodic electrical signal having the desired preselected, periodic audio frequency spectrum.By way of example and not limitation, it is often found preferable for pneumatic tires to generate a so called white noise audio spectrum in which energy is present at all frequencies in equal magnitudes, as illustrated in Fig.2A. Such a spectrum is similar to the constant sounds hear through a seashell and has been found to be the least annoying to vehicle passengers. Where a white noise audio spectrum is desired, any of the well known circuits for generating that spectral distribution may be utilized as output spectrum generator 11. The ordinarily skilled artisan will appreciate the ease with which any desired audio spectrum signal may be generated, should one other than white noise be of interest. Fast Fourier transformer 12, which receives the output signal from output spectrum generator 11, may be any device or circuit which generates an inverse Fourier transform signal thereof. There exist several commercially available units which are acceptable for use herein such asModel 5451 manufactured by The Hewlett Packard Company ofPalo Alto, California which is capable of both forward and inverse Fourier transformations. Fig. 2B depicts a single period of the inverse Fourier transform signal of the white noise signal spectrum shown in Fig. 2A. Processing circuit 13 serves to proportionally adjust the inverse Fourier transform signal by four constants as explained below. Processing circuit 13 includes two conventional non inverting summing amplifiers 14 and 15, two scalers 16 and 17, and four constant voltage sources 20, 21, 22 and 23 respectively providing constantsK1, K2, K3 and K4. Exemplary circuitry for generating K1 is sliown to include negative peak llold circuit 25 and unity gain inverter 26 while exemplary circuitry for generatingK2 includes an integrator 30, a potentiometer 31 and a divide circuit 32. Non inverting summing amplifier 14, which may be a conventional operational amplifier receiving its inputs at its non inverting terminal, receives both the inverseFourier transform signal B and the constant voltage signalK1, and adds the same to obtain waveform C in Fig. 2.Negative peak hold circuit 25 also receives the inverseFourier transform signal B, and monitors for and holds the maximum negative voltage amplitude achieved by signal B.This maximum negative voltage amplitude is received and made positive by unity gain inverter 26, whose output in turn is received by non inverting summing amplifier 14 as the constant voltage signal K1. Scaler 16, which may be a conventional multiplier, receives both the output signal C from non inverting summing amplifier 14 and the constant voltage signal K2, and multiplies waveform C by the constant voltage signalK2 Integrator 30 also receives waveform C from noninverting summing amplifier 14 and integrates the same over its period. The output signal from integrator 30 is received by a conventional divide circuit 32, which also receives a preselected constant voltage output from potentiometer 31. Divide circuit 32 divides the output signal from integrator 30 into the preselected constant voltage output from potentiometer 31 and furnishes the resultant signal to scaler 16 as the constant voltage signal K2. In a similar manner to that described above, noninverting summing amplifier 15 receives and adds both the output signal from scaler 16, shown as waveform D in Fig.2, with another preselected constant voltage K3. The output signal from non inverting summing amplifier 15, illustrated as waveform E in Fig. 2, is received by scaler 17 which multiplies this signal by the constant voltage signal K4 to achieve the output waveform F in Fig. 2.Waveform F may, where desired, be displayed on a display 33 such as an oscilloscope or other hard copy signal recorder. Having described the construction of device 10, its operation may be delineated. However, in order to more fully appreciate the various facets to the operation of device 10, it is helpful to first consider the following. Since the work of the French mathematicianFourier, it has been well known that the response of a physical device or network to a single valued periodic function may be expressed as an infinite series in trigonometric form. Each component of the series represents the response at a particular frequency and has a unique amplitude. Fourier devised a technique for obtaining the amplitudes for each frequency component in this series.Conversely, if the amplitudes for each frequency are known the composite for all frequencies being called the spec tral response , it is possible to employ this technique in inverse fashion to find the periodic function which yields the desired spectral response. This is the principle upon which operation of device 10 is founded. In order to find the tread pattern which yields the desired noise characteristics which noise characteristics are a spectral response , device 10 first generates those noise characteristics in output spectrum generator 11. Fast Fourier transformer 12 generates the periodic function which yields the desired noise characteristics.Processing circuit 13 proportionally adjusts the magnitude of this periodic function such that its relative amplitude at various points in time throughout one period is directly proportional to the length of individual pitch elements at similarly spaced locations along the tire circumference.This having been done, one period of the periodic waveform displayed on display 33 may be divided into a plurality of equal segments equal in number to the number of individual pitch elements in the tread pattern. For example, if the tread pattern is to have 64 individual pitch elements, a single period of the waveform shown on display 33 is divided into 64 equal segments. The relative amplitude of the waveform at the point between each two segments is equal to the length of the pitch element at a similarly spaced location along the tire circumference. In order to suitably proportionally adjust the magnitude of the periodic function generated by fastFourier transformer 12, processing circuit 13 first insures that the magnitude of that signal is never negative. This is necessitated by the fact that all individual pitch elements must have a real positive finite length. Device 10 achieves this requirement by transposing waveform B by a value equal to its most negative value throughout one period. One exemplary manner of implementing this, de tailed above with constant voltage source 20 and noninverting amplifier 14, is by monitoring for and holding the greatest negative amplitude throughout one period, taking its absolute value and adding this constant voltage, referred to above as K1, to waveform B. If the individual pitch element lengths obtained from device 10 are to be of value, the sum of all such lengths must equal the desired tire circumference. Thus, processing circuit 13 must scull waveform C by some constant factor which will bring the sum of its relative amplitudes at the 64 points of interest to a value proportional and preferably equal to the magnitude of the desired tire circumference. This may be achieved by multiplying waveform C including the desired relative pitch length information by a ratio of numbers representing the desired tire circumference to the sum of the relative amplitudes of all points within a single period of waveform C which represents the total relative pitch length necessary to generate the desired spectral response . By integrating waveform C, integrator 30 obtains a voltage whose magnitude is proportional to the sum of the relative amplitudes of all points within a single period of waveform C. By adjusting potentiometer 31 to furnish a constant voltage whose magnitude is proportional to the desired tire circumference which for purposes of discussion we shall let be 88 inches , divider 32 will divide the total relative pitch length into the desired tire circumference and furnish this constant voltage, previously referred to as K2, to scaler 16. Scaler 16 multiplies waveform C by K2 to yield the proportionally compressed waveform D, the sum of whose relative amplitudes at the designated points of interest, referred to hereinafter as the sum of relative amplitudes , is equal to the desired tire circumference. Design limitations for tires generally require that individual pitch lengths have a minimum finite length somewhat greater than zero inches, typically in the neighborhood of one half inch. The transposition performed by constant voltage source 20 and non inverting summing amplifier 14 leaves at least one point along waveform D with a magnitude of zero. The purpose of the introduction of constant voltage K3 is to shift waveform D so that its minimum relative magnitude corresponds to the minimum desired pitch length which for illustration may be taken as 0.6 inch . Of course the introduction of a further shift in waveform D will disturb the proportional compression performed by constant voltage source K2 and scaler 16 utilized to obtain a sum of relative amplitudes equal to the desired tire circumference. For this reason processing circuit 13 must perform one further scaling operation with the introduction of constant voltage K4 similar to that described hereinbefore. A single constant voltage K3 must be selected such that after it is added to waveform D and the resulting waveform scaled by the sum of the relative amplitudes at the designated points of interest, the modified sum of relative amplitudes is equal to the desired tire circumference. Adding a constant voltage K3 to waveform D will result in a modified sum of relative amplitudes according to the relation SM SO P N x 3 Eq. 1 where SM equals the modified sum of relative amplitudes SO equals the original sum of relative amplitudes in waveformD PN equals the desired number of individual pitch elements and, K3 is the constant added to each individual pitch element.After scaling, the smallest desired pitch length may be expressed as the constant K3 times the ratio of the original sum of relative amplitudes in waveform D to the modified sum of relative amplitudes or PMIN K3 SO sM Eq. 2 where PMIN equals the desired minimum pitch length and SO, SM and K3 are as noted above. Since the only unknowns in equations 1 and 2 areK3 and S, equations 1 and 2 may be simultaneously solved to find their values. Substituting the values given above PIN 0.6 inch So 88 inches and, P 64 , X3 is found to equal 1.064 and SM is found to equal 156.096. A constant voltage proportional to 1.064 is added to waveform D by non inverting summing amplifier 15. The output signal from non inverting summing amplifier 15, depicted in Fig. 2 as waveform E, is multiplied by constant voltage K4 from constant voltage source 24, which constant is proportional to the ratio S sM here, 88 156.096 . The resultant output signal from scaler 17, shown in Fig. 2 as waveform F and displayed on display 33, possesses a relative amplitude at various points in time throughout one period that is proportional to the length of the individual pitch elements at similarly spaced locations over the preselected tire circumference. The manner for obtaining the length for each pitch element may be best elucidated by referring to Figs.3 and 2 G . Fig. 3 depicts a portion of a tread pattern having a plurality of individual design elements pitches of varying lengths. Each pitch has been arbitrarily numbered and assigned a designation P1 to P8. Fig. 2 G shows an enlarged view of that portion of waveform F near its origin. Initially one period of waveform F is marked off into 64 equal segments 64 pitches being desired in the example herein , the first eight segments being shown inFig. 2 G . A vertical line may be scribed from the point between each two segments and the length of each pitch found from the relative amplitude of waveform F where intersected by the respective vertical line. Absolute magnitudes may be established from the point of least magnitude in waveform F, previously set by device 10 to represent the desired, preselected minimum pitch length of 0.6 inch. Assuming for the sake of discussion that the point in Fig. 2 G associated with P is the point of least 5 maynitude in waveform F, the vertical distance from projection L5 to the origin represents a length of 0.6 inch.Using this distance as a reference, the length for all pitches may be obtained from the indicated projections on the vertical amplitude axis for waveform F. Where one is desirous of confirming that the overall configuration of the preselected audio frequency spectrum has been maintained notwithstanding processing by circuit 13, fast Courier traiisformer 12 may be utilized to take the forward Fourier transform of waveform F. In the present instance the resulting audio frequency spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 4 and can be seen to exhibit the whitenoise distribution that originally was set out to be obtained. Although specific circuitry for generating constants K3 and K4 have not been shown, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that suitable voltage sources could be readily constructed in a similar manner to constant voltage sources 20 and 21 within the above noted constraints. Those individuals should also recognize that numerous well known techniques and circuits exist for generating of these constants and are acceptable for use herewith. Inasmuch as the present invention is subject to many variations, modifications and changes in detail, a number of which have been expressly stated herein, it is intended that all matter described throughout this entire specification or shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.It should thus be evident that a device constructed, and a method operated according to the concept of the present invention, and reasonably equivalent thereto, will accomplish the objects of the present invention and otherwise substantially improve the art of producing pneumatic tires having preselected noise characteristics.
