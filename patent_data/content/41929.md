# Apparatus for regenerating the resin content of a water softener cartridge.

## Abstract
The resin content 2 of a water softener cartridge 3 is regenerated by attaching a collar 7 to the upper, perforated end 6 of the cartridge casing 4 , arranged vertically, and placing salt 9 in the container so formed and lowering the cartridge 3 into a receptacle 10 containing sufficient sort, still water 11 for the water to rise through the perforated bottom 5 of the cartridge 3 and immerse the entire resin content and part of the salt contained in the collar. The apparatus is left for the front of the saline solution formed in the collar to progress downwardly through the cartridge to regenerate the entire resin content thereof.

## Description
Method and apparatus for regenerating the resin content of a water softener cartridge The present invention,relates to a method and apparatus for regenerating the resin content of a cartridge of a water softener, particularly for an espresso coffee machine, by means of a saline solution. According to the known methods at present in use, exhausted cartridges of cartridge water softeners are regenerated by immersion of the cartridges in a receptacle containing an aqueous saline solution and keeping them there for a certain period of time. Such methods of regeneration, although generally satisfactory, have several recognised disadvantages.As well as being expensive, they do not result in the complete regeneration of the cartridges. In fact, from tests carried out, it has been found that a cartridge regenerated in this manner is again exhausted after the passage of a much smaller quantity of hard water than that which caused the exhaustion of the new cartridge.In addition, the water leaving a cartridge which has just been regenerated is considerably harder than the water leaving a new cartridge. Thus, cartridges regenerated by the conventional regeneration methods have a shorter working life between two successive regenerations and soften the water to a lesser extent. As a result of this, the practice of throwing away exhausted cartridges has become widespread. The problem which is at the root of the present invention is that of devising a regeneration method which 15 able to overcome the disadvantages cited with reference to the known art. This problem is resolved by a method of the type specified which is characterised in that it comprises the following steps arranging the cartridge in a vertical position, and immersing the resin content totally in soft water such that a free surface of the soft water is formed above the resin in the cartridge and forming a saline solution continuously in the region of the said free surface, the front of the saline solution progressing downwardly through the cartridge to regenerate the resin. The formation of the free surface of soft water above the resin is, to advantage, achieved by feeding water into the cartridge from its lower end, with a rising feed. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of one embodiment given by way of non limiting example, with reference to the appended drawing which is a partially sectioned, elevational view of apparatus for carrying out the method of the invention. Referring to the appended drawing, by 1 is indicated in its entirety, apparatus for carrying out a method according to the invention for regenerating the resin content 2 of a cartridge 3 of a cartridge water softener which is not shown since it is conventional. The cartridge 3 comprises a cylindrical casing 4 provided at one end with a perforated base wall 5 and at the other end with a perforated head 6. The cartridge 3 encloses within it the resin 2. The apparatus 1 includes a collar 7 releasably attached to the head end of the cartridge 3 so as to prolong the casing 4. A toroidal washer 7a is interposed between the collar 7 and the casing 4 to ensure a fluid tight seal between the collar 7 and the casing 4. Together with the head 6 the collar 7 defines a space 8 for receiving a predetermined quantity of salt 9. The apparatus 1 further includes a transparent cylindrical receptacle 10 containing a predetermined quantity of soft water 11. The receptacle 10 has a cross section such as to accommodate the cartridge 3 disposed vertically within it with the head end, to which the collar 7 is attached, uppermost and the base end bearing on the bottom 12 of the receptacle and in fluid communication therewith. The receptacle 10 has, to advantage, raised projections 13 on the bottom 12 for supporting the cartridge 3 above the bottom itself. The receptacle 10 has substantially the same height as the total height of the cartridge 3 and the collar 7. The receptacle 10 also contains a spherical body 14 which is visible from the exterior of the receptacle 101 and which has a density between that of soft water and that of a saline solution which is formed as described below. The use of the apparatus 1 in regenerating an exhausted cartridge 3 taken from a cartridge water softener will now be described. Firstly, the collar 7 is fitted to the cartridge 3, which is placed vertically, and a predetermined quantity of salt 9 is introduced into the space 8. The cartridge is then placed in the receptacle 10 which contains a predetermined quantity of soft, still water. The water in the receptacle 10 rises within the cartridge 3, with a rising feed, by passing through the perforated base wall 5, until it again becomes still. The quantity of soft water contained in the receptacle 10 is chosen so that when the cartridge 3 is resting firmly on the projections 13, it forms a free surface 15 of soft, still water with the resin 2 totally immersed in the water and consequently with immersion of at least part, of the salt9 in the space 8. As a result of the contact which is established at the said free surface between the soft water and the salt 9 contained in the space 8, a saline solution forms continuously, the front of which propagates downwardly, gradually saturating the mass of soft still water enclosed in the cartridge, and progressing as the ion exchange reaction with the resin is completed. The front of the saline solution, having passed through the entire cartridge, reaches the base wall 5 and passes into the receptacle 10. Here it encounters the spherical body 14 which, because of gravity is deposited on the bottom 12 of the receptacle 10, and thrusts it upwardly by fluid pressure. The rising of the spherical body 14 from the bottom 12 indicates the completion of the regeneration of the cartridge. By repeated comparative tests carried out on cartridges regenerated by the traditional method and on cartridges regenerated by the method according to the present invention, it is found that the quantity of water softened in the interval between two successive regenerations increases from 80 litres for the first tests to 180 litres for the second tests while the degree of hardness of the water leaving the cartridges which have just been regenerated decreases from 20 for the first tests to 10 for the second tests. The cartridges regenerated by the method according to the invention give results which are practically identical to those of new cartridges. The main advantage of the method of regeneration according to the present invention lies in the fact that the cartridges are given a longer working life between successive regenerations and a greater softening power. Moreover, with this method, the regenerating operation is continued only for the time strictly necessary.Finally, wastage of prime materials is avoided in that the water and salt are used only in the quantities strictly necessary for the regeneration.
