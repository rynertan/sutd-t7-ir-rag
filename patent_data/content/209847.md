# RESIN COMPOSITION FOR SEALING ELECTRONIC PARTS, AND HYDRATION RESISTANT MAGNESIA POWDER AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
Disclosed is a resin composition for sealing electronic parts, which comprises a thermosetting resin and, incorpo rated therein, high purity magnesium oxide. A hydration resistant magnesia powder having the particle surfaces co vered with a continuous and uniform coating of silica is advantageously used as the magnesium oxide. This hydra tion resistant magnesia powder is prepared by introducing a heated vapor of an organic silicate compound into a reactor of a fluidized bed of magnesia powder heated at 100 to 600 C so that the concentration of the organic silicate compound is 1 to 20 mole , and precipitating a coating of silica on the surfaces of magnesia particles by thermal decomposition and or hyd rolysis of the organic silicate compound on the surfaces of magnesia particles.
