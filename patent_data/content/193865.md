# MIXING APPARATUS WITH A ROTATING MIXING MEMBER

## Abstract
In a mixing apparatus with a mixing rotor 17 and a mixing chamber 20 with exit openings 29 , the rotor and chamber are relatively movable from a mixing position Fig. 5 , in which there is a clearance 43 between the rotor and the wall of the chamber, to a dispensing position Fig. 6 , in which there is no or substantially no clearance. In the mixing position the mate rial 40, 41 being mixed circulates 44 within the mixing cham ber, and in the dispensing position the rotor 17 , being adapted to urge the mixed material 45 towards the exit open ings 29 , pumps the mixed material out through the exit open ings 29 in the form of pasty strands 46 or the like. Any lumps or hard additives, such as nuts or sweets can dies that have not been sufficiently comminuted by the mixing member in cooperation with the wall of the mixing chamber, are comminuted by a set of knives 18 cooperating with an end wall 27 , in which the exit openings 29 are formed, in the same manner as the knives in a meat mincer cooperates with its perforated disc. Thus, blockage of the exit openings 29 is avoided. The invention is particularly applicable to the mixing of ice cream stock in the form of hard frozen ice cream with various additives, such as nuts, frozen fruit chunks or biscuits, the en suing mixture being dispensed through the exit openings 29 , e.g. into a cup not shown held by the operator.
