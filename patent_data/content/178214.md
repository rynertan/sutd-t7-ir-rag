# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A MATHEMATICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

## Abstract
Strategic points on an input waveform are selected and a continuous trace is then laid through the sequence of points by an interpolation method, known as the spine function, to reconstruct the original waveform with high fidelity. One ap plication of the present apparatus is in the reconstruction of an electrocardiographic trace.
