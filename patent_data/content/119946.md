# Improved mounting arrangement for fuel rack in fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
The fuel injection pump 10 comprises a pump housing 12 in which is disposed a plurality of unit pumps 14 having each a pump piston 18 angularly adjust able by means of a longitudinally reciprocable fuel rack 22 for altering the effective delivery stroke. Each of a pair of lever arms 32 and 34 is pivotally mounted for rotation relative to pump housing 12 about a respective primary axis defined by respective pivot pins 36 and 38 . The lever arms 32, 34 are each pivotally connected to the rack 22 at respective secondary pivot axes defined by pivot pins 40, 42 to allow relative pivotal motion therebetween. One lever arm 32 has a portion 32a extending from its primary pivot axis in a direction substantially opposite from that of the secondary pivot axis. Actuating force is applied to that por tion 32a of lever arms to reciprocate the rack 22 via pivotal motion of the lever arms 32, 34 rather than requiring linear sliding motion.
