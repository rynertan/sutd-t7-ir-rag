## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Sepiolite is a hydrous magnesium silicate having a fibrous morphology. It can occur in two forms c sepiolite or para sepiolite appearing as long bundles of crystalline fibers and ff sepiolite appearing as amorphous aggregates or tiny particles, the ends of which are flat and round. Magnesium sepiolite is the commonest, although there are aluminium sepiolites l of the octahedral positions occupied by Al , ferrous xylotile , nickel ferrous Falcondoite and sodium Isoughlinite . Sepiolite particles, seen under an electronic microscope, are associated in fibrous bundles similar to those of hay. These associations can be dissociated to obtain a product having gel forming properties. Sepiolite belongs to the PaligorskiteSepiolite group in which Attapulgite and Sepiolite are found. Both clays have a similar morphology. They can be used as thickening agents , as in the case of other clays, such as bentonites. Referring to these clays which gel upon swelling, those of the PaligorskiteSepiolite group have the advantage of forming stable gels in the presence of electrolytes. Many processes to obtain Paligorskite Sepiolites having gel forming properties in aqueous media have been described, for example U.S. patent 3,951,850 describes the preparation of colloidal Attapulgite by hydrodynamic attrition, U.S. patents No. 3,399,068 and 3,509,056 describe the manufacture of rheological grade Attapulgite using flocculating and dispersing agents.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVE ION The present invention refers to a rheological grade sepiolite product and to processes for manufacturing it. The product of this invention is a thickener, gellant, suspending agent having a Sepiolite content of at least 50 , essentially consisting of 62.0 SiO2, 25.2h MgO, 1.2 A1203, 0.5 Fe203, 0.4 CaO, 0.3 X20, 0.1 Wa20. The product of the invention is obtained from naturally occuring sepiolite by neans of special physical processes, to be described which permit the bundles to be dissociated and the individual particles thereof to be separated, without affecting its acicular structure. The product can easily be dispersed in water or polar solvents, giving rise to high viscosity suspensions. The rheological grade Sepiolite of this invention can have the form of a power or noodles or ver micillio. The noodle type product has a higher density, permitting a more economical transportation and a simpler handling. This product, when dispersed in water, proportions particles having a size of less than 10 Xm. Table I summarises the most important charac teristics of the product of the invention, in both presen tation forms thereof TABLE I Appearance Powder Noodles Moisture 4 7 10 12 Apparent Density g l 80 100 430 Absorption DOP w 340 350 340 350 Syneresis 0 0 pH 8.5 9.0 8.5 9.0 Colour Off white Off white BROOKFIELD viscosity at 5 rpm CPS 24,400 32,800 Wet Granulometry 37 0.0 0.0 20 p 0.5 0.5 10 5.0 5.0 5 6.0 6.0 88.5 88.5 xx 6 6 Suspension stirred at 2700 rmp in COZIES for 30 mins. x 3 Suspension stirred at 12,000 rmp in LOMI for 5 mins., measuring the syneresis after 72 hours. The special characteristics of sepiolite are due to the peculiar acicular form of its particles. These, due to their structure, do not swell but have an elevated anisometry, so that when dispersed in water they form a random network which traps the solvent, giving rise to high viscosity suspensions. The structure is maintained due to the existence of electrostatic forces at the surface edge, despite the fact that due to the low isomorphic substitution present in the sepiolite1 it is not as important as in laminar silicates, and to the formation of hydrogen bridges through the SiOR silanol groups of the sepiolite structure. The same anisometry of the particles also aids in maintaining the structure, preventing settling to a compact structure. Apart from structuring the solvent, giving rise to high viscosity suspensions, the product of the invention proportions the medium with a rheologic or a characteristic flowing behaviour. As indicated, the acicular particles of the sepiolite appear agglomerated. forming large bundles similar to piles of hay. These bundles can easily be dispersed in water and other solvents having an average or high polarity, forming a random network of fibers which trap the liquid. When a suspension of the product is subjected to a shearing stress, a certain shearing stress value must necessarily be exceeded so that the suspension can flow.This shearing stress value or flowing limit is that necessary to break the formed structure. Above this flowing limit, the viscosity of the suspensions do not remain constant, but it is reduced with the shearing stress. Due to the existence of said flowing limit, the rheological grade sepiolite product of the invention can act as a suspending agent, preventing sedimentation of charges or pigments and due to the reduction in viscosity under stirring, it can be used as a thixotropic agent. The viscosity of the solutions of the product of the invention increases rapidly with the concentration, and it is possible to obtain high viscosity suspensions at relatively low concentrations. The noodle shaped product gives rise to suspensions having a higher viscosity than the powdered product, since this has been subjected to a dry grinding process which can degrade thestructure of the particles. The viscosity of the suspensions is determined by the degree of dispersion or dissociation of the acicular fiber bundles in the solvent. The degree of dispersion is determined by the energy applied to the system to overcome the force maintaining the fibers joined in bundles. This energy is mainly supplied by stirring and can be increased by raising tbe stirring time and or speed. The viscosity of the suspensions of the powdered product increases as the stirring time and or speed increases. that is when the dispersion energy is increased. The noodle shaped product has a similar behaviour except at low speeds A1800 rpm and short times z35 minutes , since it requires a minimum energy to complete dispersion and to reach the maximum viscosity. A determined viscosity can be obtained by adjusting the stirring speed or time, wherefore relatively high viscosities can be obtained at low speeds by merely increasing the stirring time. The increase in temperature when preparing the suspension enhances the building up of the viscosity, wherefore a high viscosity can be obtained for the same stirring time and speed. However, the influence of this temperature factor in the preparation of the suspension is only slight, the maximum building up of the viscosity being obtained at a temperature of approximately 40 C, above which a reduction in the viscosity is observed. Furthermore, it has been observed that the maximum viscosity is obtained at a pR of 7.5 8.5, precisely at which the product of the invention is buffered.Abode a pH of 9, a reduction of the viscosity takes place until the total peptization is reached at a pH of 11.011.5. Likewise, below a pH of 4, a reduction in the viscosity takes place. The product of the invention, unlike other commercial thickening agents, such as bentonite, gives rise to stable suspensions in media having a high electrolyte concentration, although these electrolytes can give rise to variations in the viscosity. The product of the invention is a thickener, gellant for aqueous systems or organic solvents having a high or average polarity and polyfunctional solvents, such as glycols, polyalchols, alkanol amines, placticizers, etc. Nevertheless due to the essentially hydrophilic nature of the surface of its particles, it is impossible to obtain stable suspensions in low polarity solvents, espesall in aromatic media. The processes for manufacturing rheological grade sepiolite of the invention will now be described. Process I A mineral selectively extracted with a sepiolite purity of more than 80 is used as the starting product. The calcite, ddomite, feldspar, quartz and mica contamination does not affect the properties of the end product, since it is eliminated in the process but the smectite content must be less than 10 , since it negatively affects the properties of the sepiolite and the elimination yield thereof in the process is rather low. Once the mineral is selected, it is grinded with a moisture comprised between 30 and 40 , in successive steps, to a granulometry of less than 5 mm. The product thus treated is wetted with water, adding thereto the necessary amount of water so that the moisture is comprised between 50 to 6CPh. This wetting must preferably be conducted for a period of time of up to 24 hours, although it can last longer.The ground and wetted sepiolite is moist dissociated by applying various consecutive dissociations to increase the yield of the product with a granulometry of less than 10 jU. The wet dissociated product is granulometrically classified by means of various hydrocyclonated steps. The number of steps and hydrocyclone sizes will depend on the final granulometry and on the desired rheological grades. To conduct the hydrocyloned steps, it is necessary to work with solid concentrations of less than 10 . The use of higher concentrations would negatively affect the classification steps, since the rheological behaviour of the suspension to be classified reduces the effectiveness of the hydrocyclone. After classifica tion, products having different granulometries and viscosities can be obtained.Usually, the granulometry is of less than 10y, although products having elevated viscosities and granulometries of less than 74 X can be obtained.The viscosities of the end product will vary, depending on the granulometry and purification of the sepiolite from 10,000 cp to 34 000 cp Brookfield 5 rmp, 250C in 6 aqueous solutions . The concentration of the dissociated product can take place by centrifugation and in vacuo filtration. Once concentrated, a paste having a solids concentration of 45 55 can be obtained, which is cut and dried at a temperature below 1100 C. Process II A rheological degree sepiolite can also be obtained by using, as the starting product, sepiolite or a sepiolite mineral having a sepiolite concentration above 50 . The most frequent contaminations are calcite, dolomite, feldspar, mica and quartz. The properties and the process are not affected thereby, but the smectite contamination must never be more than 20 of the mineral since, although the process purifies the sepiolite, the smectite elimination yield is low, and smectite contents above 20 in the end product affect the rheological grades of the product. The mineral will be used with its moisture after extraction, which is usually of fron 30 to 40 . It is not recommendable to dry the mineral because it involves an unnecessary expense and because the product could be damaged during drying. The product is grinded in successive steps to a granulonetry of less than 2 mm. After grinding, water is added until the solids concentration of the suspension is of 5 25 . A dispersing product is added to the suspension ip an amount of from 0.5 to 3 based on the added sepiolite. The dispersing agents used can be inorganic, such as for example, alkali salts of hexametaphosphoric, tripolyphosphoric, pyrophosphoric acids and, in general, all the alkali salts of polyphosphoric acids. Polysilicates can also be used. Besides, mixtures of these dispersing agents with nagnesium oxides or hydroxides can be used to improve the flowing characteristics of the suspension. The clay suspension is stirred with the dispersing agent, using a stirrer having a high shearing stress, for 5 15 minutes. This stirring can take place in two steps in the first of which stirring is carried out with low revolutions for 2 to 7 minutes, and in the second with high revolutions for 2 to 8 minutes. Once the bundles of sepiolite fibers are dissociated, the highest density fraction is separated by decantation or centrifugation. In this ep, the mineral is purified until a product having a sepiolite content above 95 is obtained. The supernatant is separated in a decanter or in a centrifuge and is passed to a stirrer to which a flocclatine agent will be added. In this step the solids concentration will be in the range of fro 5 to 15C. The flocculating agent could be any magnesium salt or mixtures thereof. Calcium salts can also be used and, in general, any divalent cation soluble salt.Normally from 0.5 30X, of the flocculating agent will be added. For example in the event tetrasodium pyrophosphate and magnesium sulphate are used, the nolar ratio must be of 1 2. The dispersed clay with the flocculating agent added thereto is stirred under the same conditions as those described in the dispersing process. After stirring, a pumpable sepiolite gel is obtained. This gel is introduced in a filter which concentrates the clay to a solids content of 45 55 . The filtered cake is cut and dried at a temperature below 110 C. In the aforegoing processes, the moisture of the end product has no bearing on its properties, although it is always preferable to carry out dry grinding with a moisture of from8 to 12 , to protect the sepiolite fiber from degradation which it undergoes to a lesser or greater degree during grinding. The dry product is triturated and ground until the desired granulometry is reached, depending on the application.Although in aqueous dispersions. the wet granulometry of the product is independent of this grinding process and only depends on the wet grinding process. it can be of interest to obtain products having dry granulometries of less than 44gr or even 10 y. These products are suitable for dry mixing processes of sepiolite with other components having a given formula, or in processes in which the solvent is other than water. In these cases it is necessary to use a product having the dry granulometry required for each application. If rheological grade sepiolite is to be used as the thickening or suspending agent in aqueous media, it is not necessary to grind the dry paste. since the product dispersed in water will already have its granulometry. In this case. the wet paste is cut and extrusioned to obtain a product in the forn of churros which is dried under the previously mentioned conditions. This product furthermore has two advantages, a higher rheological yield and a higher apparent density apart from the fact that its dispersion in water poses no problems. The characteristics of the product obtained in both cases are the following Dry ground product Brookfield viscosity 5 rmp, 24 C, 6 solids concentration ......... 200000 24000 cp Apparent density ................... 80 100 g l Dispersibility 72 hours .......... 100 Extrusioned product Brookfield viscosity 5 rmp, 24 C, 6 solids concentration ......... 31000 33000 cp Apparent density ................... 430 450 g l Dispersibility 72 hours .......... 100 0 This range of products can form rather viscuous suspensions at relatively low concentrations if compared with other clays another important characteristic is the high dispers .lity of the sepiolite particles in aqueous media and its high stability.Thus if a 3 rheological grade sepiolite is dispersed in water at 12,000 rmp LOMI stirrer for 5 minutes, no freeing of water will be observed 72 hours after initiating the preparation.Process III A sepiolite mineral having a sepiolite content of at least 50 is used as the starting product. It is not advisable for the mineral to be used to have a smectite contamination greater than 35 , feldspar, mica, quartz, other fibrous clay and carbonate contazinations not influencing this process. The mineral is used with the moisture present after extraction which is normally not greater than 40 . The product is grinded in successive steps to a granulometry of less than 80 ASTM mesh. After grinding, water is added until the moisture of the mineral is of from 40 to 70Co. The mineral thus moistened is blended in a turbo mixer for more than 1 minute , the duration of blending not having an upper limit since better rheological grades are obtained, the longer the duration thereof. The properties of the end product can be improved, above all insofar as dispersibility, adding to the blending paste sodium bicarbonate in a percentage of up to 2 based on dry mineral. After blending, the product can be formed or extrasioned at a low pressure, so that drying can take place more homogenously. This step is not necessary but it improves the handling of the product and the drying speed. Drying can take place using any known system.The only condition for this process is that the mineral must not reach temperatures above 110 C. Once dried, the product as obtained can either be used or it can be grinded to the desired granulometric size. During grinding the moisture must necessarily be of from8 to 12 to protect the structure of the product from degradations which would give rise to a reduction or a loss in the rheological grades, or to aging processes in the long run. If grinding does not take place or is slight, this consideration is not important. In any case, the decision of carrying out grinding will depend on the application of the product. After grinding a granulometric classification can be carried out to obtain finer fractions. Classification becomes recommendable in those cases in which the application requires a small, dry granulometric size, either because the product must be dry dosed or because it must be dispersed in low polarity systems. The characteristics of the product obtained according to this process can vary considerably, depending on the mineralogy and on the nixing time and moisture. The invention will now be described with more detail making reference to specific examples, given merely by way of illustration and not limiting of the object of the invention.

To the spernatant there are added 20 g of magnesium sulphate and it is stirred at 500 rpn for 2 minutes and at 2,700 rpm for 8 minutes. A gel is formed from which the water is removed by in vacuo filtration on filter paper, until a cake having a solids concentration of 50 is obtained. The cake is dried at 1000C to a moisture of 10 , it is cut and ground in a blade mill.
