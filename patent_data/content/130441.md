# Pressure measuring system.

## Abstract
A pressure measuring system comprising a pressure sensitive element 8 and a container 1 provided with at least one inlet 2 , the container being intended to communi cate through this inlet 2 with the medium whose pressure is to be measured. The system is characterised in that a pressure trans mitting wall part 12 of the container 1 is adapted so that with the help of a negative pressure it is fastened on by suction to the pressure sensitive element 8 for measuring substantially the absolute pressure in the container. The system is particularly suitable for extracorporeal measurement of blood which is subjected to negative pres sure.
