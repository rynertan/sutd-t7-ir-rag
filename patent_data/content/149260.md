## Abstract
A ballasted non diffusing compound capable of dye or dye precursor release by a redox reaction in alkaline medium characterized in that said compound corresponds to the following general formula CAR L D wherein CAR represents a carrier moiety, L represents a chemical group cleavable or releasable from the carrier moiety by a redox reaction in alkaline aqueous medium, and D represents a dye or dye precursor part i containing several dye or dye precursor units, and ii incorporating groups that improve the diffusibility of the released dye part or dye precursor part in a hydrophilic colloid medium when permeated by an aqueous alkaline liquid.
