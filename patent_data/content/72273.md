## Description
LOW TENPERATURE DIE ATTACE PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVEEION Field of the Invention This invention relates to integrated circuits, and in particular, to a method for attaching an integrated circuit to an underlying substrate. Description of the Prior Art In the manufacture of integrated circuits, silicon wafers containing many separate integrated circuits are fabricated and then cut into individual circuits knows as die. The functional individual circuits are then packaged using z variety of known techniques. In one such prior art technique an individual integrated circuit die is attached to an underlying substrate using a metallurgical process. According to this technique gold is first deposited on the back of the silicon wafer.The substrate to which an individual die is to be attached is then coated with a desired material, typically gold, silver, platinum, palladium, or comsinations thereof. The coated wafer is cut into dice, and an individual gold backed die is placed in contact with the coating on the substrate and heated. The gold on the die and the coating on the substrate then form an alloy which serves to electrically and physically connect the back of the integrated circuit die to the substrate. Unfortunately such prior art processes must be very carefully controlled because if the gold silicon interface is unde ailoyeÅa it will not provide adhesion, and if over alloyed will produce a surface which will not wet to enable physical joining of the die and substrate. Additionally, in the manufacture of many integrated citcuits, for example,N Changel NOS devicas, the resulting devices are extremely sensitive to gold contamination. Finally. such prior art processes are difficult to use n the manofacture of heat sensitIve products such as charge coupled device image sensors or memories SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invontion a method for attaching an integrated circuit to 2 substrate includes the step of coating a surface of the integrated circuit with a composition which includes silver, coating 2 surface of substrate with a metal or alloy chosen from the group of gold, silver, platinum and palladium, and attaching the surface of the integrated circuit to the surface of the substrate with a melted composition of gold and tin. Gold, platinum, and pletinum palladium have been found particularly suitable for coating the substrate. Typically, the gold tin composition will be the eutectic composition, in other words, 8C percent gold and 20 percent tin by weight.Further, in the preferred embodiment in joining the die to the substrate the gold tin composition is held at or above its melting point for a relatively short period of time, typically on the order of 0.5 to o minutes. The process of this invention permits an integrated circuit die to be attached to an underlying substrate at a relatively low temperature with high reliability and thermal conductivity. For reasons not yet fully understood, once the die is attached to the substrate the remelt temperature to remove or displace the die is substantially higher than the original melt temperature. This phenomenon allows the use of subsequent high temperatare processing in conjunction with the assembled die and substrate without loosening the die sub strate ccrmection. BRIEF DE CRIPIDION OF mE DRÇ Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an integrated circuit die with backside coating. Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the die, preform and substrate prior to melting the preform. Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of the structure ofFig. 2 following melting of the preform. DESCRIPTION OF THE PXMSSKKLU EMBODIMENT In the preferred embodiment the backside of a silicon wafer containing a plurality of integrated circuits is prepared for the die attach process by being coated with chromium and silver. This is typically accomplished by a phased deposition process in which chromium is initially deposited on the silicon wafer backside and then silver phased into the deposition while chromium is phased out. The result is a graded concentration profile which extends from nearly pure chromium in contact with the silicon to substantially pure silver at the outer surface.Chromium serves to adhere the silver to the silicon. A die 12 with coating 15 from such a wafer is shown in cross section inFigure 1. As shown in Figure 2 a gold tin preform of substantially eutectic composition is placed between die 12 and substrate 20 a surface 25 of which has been coated with a metal comprising at least one of gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The term preform is intended to denote a piece of gold tin of suitable shape and size to result in a desired molten amount of material when the preform is heated above its melting temperature. In a preferred embodiment preform 18 comprises a eutectic composition of gold and tin, that is, substantially 80 percent gold and 20 percent tin by weight. The use of the eutectic composition is particularly advantageous because the low melting temperature 288 C enables the entire process to be carried out at relatively low temperatures. Next, substrate 20, preform 18, and the die 12 including chromium silver coating 15, are heated to at least the melting point of preform 18. This step is illustrated inFig. 3. In the preferred embodiment when preform 18 comprises 80 percent gold and 20 percent tin by weight, the melting .emDera.ure is approximately 2 Q C. Beating the structure to 300 C has been ound sufficient to relIably and completely melt the preform. Once the melting temperature is reached, the corn coined structure showy in Figure 3 Is held at that ten. erature for a time between one halt and four minutes. I have discovered that the optimal perIod of time or an integrated circuit die on the order of 200 mils by 200 mils is about 1.5 minutes, however, as presently understood, the optimum time period depends upon the geometry and size of the die 12.The relatively short time period is of critical importance. If the time is too short the preform will not melt completely.If too long over alloying will result. The alloy of coating 15 with preform 18 designated 15 18 which results from this procedure is not well under stood, but comprises at least an alloy of gold tin silver, and may include some chron wr,. It is presently belIeved that not all of coating 15 melts, and for this reason 2 thin layer of coating 15 is shown above alloy 15 58. Of substantial advantage, however, is the fact that the resulting alloy typically melts at approximately 0 C, rather than about 2880C, the temperature at which it was formed. This change in melting temperature permits the die attach process of this invention to be used with die which are subjected to subse cuent thermal processes, but cannot be subjected to high temperature. The process described above is particularly advantangeous in that no gold is required on the wafer. Instead, chromium and silver are used. Further, I have found that die attach wetting occurs easily at 300 C, and that by the use of gold coating on substrate 20 scrubbing of the die 12 against the substrate 20 to accomplish wetting is unnecessary. When other metals are used to coat the die attach region 25 of substrate 20, however, minimal scrubbing may be required. Scrubbing is the motion of the die 12 relative to the substrate 20 to permit complete wetting of the die surface to be attached to substrate 20. The process described above is particularly advantageous in the assembly of heat sensitive products such as charge coupled device image sensors and memories. A more general advantage is that by elimination of scrubbing, yields are increased and automated systems, for example, conveyor type heaters, may be utilized to attach the oie to the substrate. Although several embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that numerous variations may be employed without departing from the scope of the appended claims below.
