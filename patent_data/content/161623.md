# POLYMERIC BATTERY SEPARATORS

## Abstract
Configurations of cross linked or vulcanized amphophilic or quaternized block copolymer of haloalkyl epoxides and hy droxyl terminated alkadiene polymers are useful as battery se parators in both primary and secondary batteries, particularly nickel zinc batteries. The quaternized block copolymers are prepared by polymerizing a haloalkyl epoxide in the presence of a hydroxyl terminated 1,3 alkadiene to form a block copo lymer that is then reacted with an amine to form the quater nized or amphophilic block copolymer that is then cured or cross linked with sulfur, polyamines, metal oxides, organic peroxides and the like.
