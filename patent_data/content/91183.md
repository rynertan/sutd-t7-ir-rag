# FUNCTIONAL OXYGEN TRANSPORT SYSTEM

## Abstract
Functional oxygen transport systems OTS have been devised which may serve as temporary blood substitutes in the circulatory system. The OTS comprises pure crystalline hemoglobin dissolved in an aqueous solution and encapsu lated within a complex lipid and carbohydrate modified lipid phase. The hemoglobin encapsulated inner aqueous phase and the encapsulating lipid phase are dispensed in an outer isotonic aqueous phase to form a suspension of the multiple water in oil in water emulsion type. The emulsion is suitable to transfusion into the circulatory system to assist in oxygen transport. The carbohydrate modified lipids are included in the lipid phase to mask the OTS from the tissue binding and take up by the reticuloendothelial system. The OTS are also suitable for use as calibrating fluids in gas analysis apparatus.
