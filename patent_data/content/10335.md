# Emulsifier free latexes and photographic light sensitive elements containing them.

## Abstract
A latex is formed of a copolymer of 90 to 98 by weight of ethyl acrylate and 2 to 10 by weight of an ionogenic com onomer. The latter comprises in its structure a polymerisable ethylenically unsaturated bond, a hydrophobic chain com prising at least 8 carbon atoms, and a strong hydrophilic group taken from a sulpho group, a sulphato group or a phosphono group in acid or salt form. Photographic layers are described wherein the above latex is used as plasticizer for gelatin.
