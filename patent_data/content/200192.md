# Magnetic recording reproduction apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording reproduction apparatus of the invention has a magnetic head 10 for reading a vertical magnetically recorded signal, an inplane magnetic recorded signal or a magnetic recorded signal having both a vertical magnetic component and an inplane magnetic component and for supplying a reproduced signal, a first analog signal converting circuit 11 for converting the reproduced signal into an analog inplane reproduced signal when the repro duced signal is a vertical reproduced analog signal, a second analog signal converting circuit 12 for bypassing an inplane analog reproduced signal when the reproduced signal is the inplane reproduced analog signal, and a third analog signal converting circuit 13 for converting the reproduced signal into an inplane reproduced analog signal when the repro duced signal is the inplane reproduced analog signal. The circuits 11, 12, 13 are switched to operate selectively in accordance with the type of signals reproduced from a magnetic recording medium.
