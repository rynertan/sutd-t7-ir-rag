# MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium comprising a non magnetic support having provided thereon a magnetic layer mainly composed of needle like magnetic powder and a binder, the magnetic powder being ferromagnetic metal powder having a coercive force of 1,000 Oe or more and a specific surface area of 45 m² g BET method or more and the binder containing 50 wt or more resin having high dispersibility due to the presence of at least one polar group a selected from the group consisting of I , wherein M represents H, Li, Na or K, and M₁ and M₂ each represent H, Li, Na, K or an alkyl group to attain excellent magnetic properties required for short wave recording and improve durability.
