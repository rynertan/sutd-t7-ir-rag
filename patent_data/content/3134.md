# Magnetic brush development apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic brush development apparatus in which a developer containing magnetic powder therein is attracted to a non magnetic support member 10 having a magnet 11 therein, and said developer attracted to said non magnetic support member 10 is brought into contact with a latent electrostatic image bearing member in a development section for developing said latent electrostatic image, the improvement wherein said magnet 11 has substantially one magnetic pole portion capable of producing a magnetic field having a plurality of peaks 14 in the intensity of said magnetic field in said development section.
