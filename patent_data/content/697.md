# A lubricating composition in the form of a gel consisting of an oil and polymethylpentene.

## Abstract
Lubricating compositions and shaped articles composed thereof for use in bearings and the like are described which consist essentially of about 50 to about 90 by weight of an oil of lubricating viscosity and about 50 to about 10 by weight of polymethylpentene having an average molecular weight in the range from about 3 to about 5 million the oil being a mineral oil, a diester oil or preferably a synthetic hydrocarbon oil, and having a viscosity in the range from about 15 to about 300 millimetres² second mm² s at 38 C 100 F the shaped articles can be formed in situ in an article such as a bearing or a mold by heat curing a physical mixture of the oil and polymethylpentene at a temperature somewhat above the initial softening point of the latter for about 45 to 75 minutes and allowing the mixture to cool to form a firm, tough, solid gel having an oily surface provided by oil exuding from the gel to thus produce a lubricating mass operable for extended periods of time at temperature up to about 160 C 320 F . These shaped lubricating masses may be used as formed or may be shaped further by conventional physical means.
