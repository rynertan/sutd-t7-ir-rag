## Description
The invention relates to a process for preparing virtually spherical catalyst particles for polymerizing alkenes 1 and for copo lymerizing alkenes 1 with each other and or with ethylene which at least consist of a halogenated titanium compound, an electron donor and a magnesium halide, by means of a spray drying technique. Such a process is known from the British patent specification 1.434.543. According to this patent specification rounded or spherical catalyst particles are obtained by spray drying a magnesium halide, preferably MgCl₂.6 H₂O, melted or dissolved in water, with known devi ces and methods to form particles of 1 300 µm, preferably 30 180 µm, while these particles are subsequently subjected to controlled dehydration until less than 4 moles crystal water per mole magnesium halide is left and hydrolysis of the magnesium halide is avoided, upon which the partly dehydrated particles are converted, preferably above 100 C, in a liquid containing a halogenated titanium compound, preferably TiCl₄, and finally the non converted titanium compound is removed. When using MgCl₂.6 H₂O the melted chloride is sprayed into a current of hot air or hot nitrogen with sprayers having opening the chosen diameters of which are such that the rounded particles formed are between 10 and 300 µm in size. According to this British patent specification another process for preparing rounded or spherical cata lyst particles consists in the spraying of a solution of a non aqueous magnesium halide in an organic solvent by means of known methods in devices for obtaining spherical particles. The solvent may be, for instance, an alcohol, an ether, a ketone or an ester with a boiling point between 60 and 150 C. The spraying is then effected at a temperature and pressure at which the spherical par ticles formed are free of solvent not chemically bonded to the magne sium halide and have the desired particle size distribution, pre ferably between 1 and 300 µm. Subsequently the solvent bonded to the carrier is removed by heating at reduced pressure at a temperature higher than 150 C and finally at 200 350 C. The spherical particles thus obtained are then contacted with a halogenated titanium compound for the purpose of fixing the desired amount of titanium to the carrier. This can be done, for instance, by suspending the particles in an inert solvent in which the titanium compound is dissolved in the amount to be deposited and by subsequently evaporating the solvent. The known process shows the following disadvantages. The known process is very complicated. It comprises many steps. Thus the first thing to do is to prepare the magnesium halide, which is usually done by halogenating an organic magnesium compound dissolved in an apolar solvent, such as heptane, and subsequently filtering off the magnesium halide deposit formed. This deposit must then be melted with all problems involved or be dissolved in a polar solvent and sub sequently the melt or the solution must be spray dried. The particles resulting from the spray drying of the solution must then be laboriously cleared of the solvent still bonded to the magnesium halide after the spray drying, which cleaning cannot be complete enough without affecting the crystal structure of the magnesium halide in consequence of the extreme conditions for instance very high tem peratures required for this virtually complete cleaning. Further, if used as catalyst system for polymerizing alkenes 1 and for copoly merizing alkenes 1 with each other and or with ethylene as customary in combination with a cocatalyst, for instance an organoaluminium com ponent such as a trialkylaluminium compound or a dialkylaluminium halide, the catalyst particles prepared in this known manner show only a moderate activity, while the stereospecifity and the purity of the resulting polymer in relation to the catalyst residues particularly titanium and halogen are not quite satisfactory. The process according to the invention meets these disadvan tages, it is much simpler and catalyst system containing catalyst par ticles prepared by applying this process instead of catalyst particles prepared according to the known process shows a highly improved acti vity, stereospecificty and purity of the resulting polymer. According to the invention a process for preparing virtually spherical catalyst particles for polymerizing alkenes 1 and for copolymerizing alkenes 1 with each other and or with ethylene, which at least consist of a halogenated titanium compound, an electron donor and a magnesium halide, by means of a spray drying technique is characterized in that a suspension of an intimate mixture of magnesium halide and aluminium halide containing at least 1 part by weight of aluminium per 15 parts by weight of magnesium is subjected to spray drying, the spray dried material is subsequently treated with at least one electron donor and with at least one suitable solvent under such conditions that at least a part of the aluminium compound s present is washed out and the pro duct thus obtained is treated with liquid titanium IV halide. The object of the treatment with solvent is to remove at least a part of the aluminium compound s present so that cavities are formed in the catalyst particle, in which subsequently titanium IV halide can be incorporated. The treatment with electron donor and with solvent preferably takes place simultaneously, e.g. by using for this purpose a treating liquid which contains a solution of electron donor in solvent. Liquid titanium IV halide also means in this connection a solution of a titanium IV halide in a suitable solvent. In the treatment of the spray dried material with electron donor in the process according to the invention titanium IV halide may be present, for instance in the form of a complex with the electron donor. Electron donors suitable for the process according to the invention are, for instance, oxygen containing donors, such as alco hols, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, acid halides, carboxylic acids, esters, ethers and acid amides, or nitrogen containing electron donors, such as ammonia, amines, nitriles, isocyanates and nitro com pounds. Specific examples of electron donors than can be used are alcohols with 1 18 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance methanol, ethanol, propanol, hexanol, stearylalcohol, benzylalcohol, phenyl ethylalcohol or cumylalcohol phenols with 6 18 carbon atoms per mole cule, for instance phenol, cresol, xylenol, ethyl phenol, propyl phe nol, octyl phenol, dibutyl phenol, cumyl phenol or naphtol ketones with 3 15 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance acetone, methyl ethylketone, methylisobutylketone, acetophenone or benzophenone alde hydes with 2 15 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance ethanal, pro panal, heptanal, benzaldehyde, tolualdehyde or naphthaldehyde acid halides with 2 15 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance acetylch loride, benzoylchloride or toluylchloride acid amides with 2 15 car bon atoms, for instance formamide, acetamide, benzamide or toluamide amines with 2 18 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, piperidine, tribenzylamine, aniline, pyridine, picoline or ethylenediamine nitri les with 2 15 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance acetonitrile, benzonitrile or tolunitrile or nitro compounds, for instance, nitro benzene. Preference is given to ethers with 2 20 carbon atoms per molecule, for instance dimethylether, diethylether, di n butylether, di i amylether, tetrahydrofurane, anisole or diphenylether, and par ticularly organic esters with 2 40, particularly 2 18 carbon atoms per molecule. The acid component of the ester mostly contains 1 9 carbon atoms per molecule or is a natural fatty acid, while the alcohol com ponent of the ester mostly contains 1 6 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of suitable esters are methylformate, cyclohexylformate, ethylacetate, vinylacetate, amylacetate, 2 ethylhexylacetate, cyclo hexylacetate, ethylpropionate, amylpropionate, methylbutyrate, ethyl valerate, methylchloracetate, ethyldichloracetate, methylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, n butylacrylate, ethylcrotonate, dimethylmaleate, ethylcyclohexanecarboxylate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, i benzyl benzoate, octyl benzoate, cyclohexyl benzoate, phenyl benzoate, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl benzoate, methyl toluate, ethyl toluate, i amyl toluate, methyl anisate, ethyl anisate, γ butyrolactone, δ caprolactone, coumarin, phthalide and ethylene carbonate. Special preference is given to esters derived from aromatic acids, par ticularly esters of benzoic acid substituted or not substituted with alkyl groups or alkoxy groups. Alkyl esters having 1 4 carbon atoms per alkyl group, particularly methyl esters or ethyl esters of benzoic acid, o or p toluenecarboxylic acid, p methoxybenzoic acid or phtha lic acid should be given particular preference. Titanium IV halides suitable for the process according to the invention are TiBr₄, TiI₄, Ti isobutoxy ₂Cl₂, Ti phenoxy Cl₃, Ti o methylphenoxy Cl₃, titanium IV trichloridemonophenolate, titanium IV dichloridediphenolate, titanium IV trichloride mono p cresolate, titanium IV monochloride 1 naphtholate, titanium IV tri chloridemono p chlorophenolate , titanium IV tribromide mono p cresolate, titanium IV tribromide mono xylenolate isomer mixture , titanium IV monoiodidetrianisolate and notably TiCl₄. The intimate mixture of magnesium halide and aluminium halide to be applied must be at least virtually free of water and preferably also at least virtually free of magnesium oxide. The expressions at least virtually free of water and at least virtually free of magnesium oxide are understood in this connection to mean that the concentration of water, respectively magnesium oxide, in the carrier material is insignificant, as far as water is concerned in any case lower than 0.2 wt , preferably 0.1 wt at most, and as far as magnesium oxide is concerned in any case lower than 0.1, pre ferably 0.01 at most, calculated, per g carrier material, as mgeq of base titratable with dilute strong acid, for instance 0.1 N hydro chloric acid. This intimate mixture of magnesium halide and aluminium halide may further contain minor amounts of other metal ions, for instance sodium, tin, silicon or germanium. The magnesium aluminium weight ratio is preferably 1 1 to 10 1. The halogen is preferably chlorine, but may for instance also be bromine or iodine or a mixture of halogens. According to a preferred mode of realizing the process according to the invention an intimate mixture of magnesium halide and aluminium halide is used obtained by converting a combination of an organic aluminium compound and an organic magnesium compound with a halogenating agent having the formula RX The halogenating agent may also be a free halogen and an interhalogen compound, for instance Cl₂, Br₂, I₂, ICl, ICl₃ or BrCl. The organic aluminium compound preferably contains one or more hydrocarbon groups bonded direct to the metal. The hydrocarbon groups preferably contain 1 10 carbon atoms. Examples are trialkyl aluminium or trialkenylaluminium compounds, for instance triethylalu minium, tripropylaluminium, triisobutylaluminium, triisoprenylalumi nium, trihexylaluminium and trioctylaluminium dialkylaluminiumhydri des, for instance diethylaluminiumhydride or diisobutylaluminiumhydri de dialkylaluminium halides, particularly a chloride or bromide, diethylaluminiumchloride and diethylaluminiumbromide being par ticularly suitable, but for instance di n butyl aluminiumchloride or methyl n butylaluminiumchloride can be used also and mono alkyl aluminiumdihalides, for instance ethylaluminiumdichloride, n butyl aluminiumdichloride or n hexylaluminiumdibromide. If a halogen containing organic aluminium compound is used, the halogen is pre ferably the same as in the halogenating agent used. Trialkylaluminium compounds are preferred. The organic magnesiumcompound may be for instance a dialkyl magnesium or an alkylmagnesium halide. Again the hydrocarbon groups preferably contain 1 10 carbon atoms. Examples are ethylmagnesiumch loride, n butylmagnesiumchloride, i propylmagnesiumbromide, n decyl magnesiumiodide, ethyl n butylmagnesium, di n butylmagnesium, di i amylmagnesium and di n octylmagnesium. The conversion of the organic metal compounds in the intimate mixture of magnesium halide and aluminium halide is very conveniently effected by precipitating this mixture from a solution of the organic metal compounds in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and mixed aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons with 3 8 carbon atoms per molecule, which hydrocarbons are preferably inert under the reaction conditions, for instance butane, i butane, n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Further details regarding this preferred process are described in the British patent publication 2.047.255 A. In the pre ferred process a very important improvement of the activity of the catalyst at high stereospecificity can be reached. Examples of preferred solvents used for the solvent treatment of the spray dried material are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and mixed aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons with 4 12 carbon atoms per molecule, such as butane, isobutane, n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, tetralin, decalin, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Halogenated hydrocarbons can be used also, for instance CCl₄ or C₂Cl₆. If so desired, the solvent may contain harmless additives. For improving the activity of the catalyst particles in addition to one or more solvents and eventually one or more electron donors the treating liquid prefer ably also contains at least one alcohol, preferably an unsubstituted phenol or a phenol subsituted with one or more halogen groups and or with one or more alkyl groups and or alkoxy groups with, for instance, 1 6 carbon atoms per group. Examples of suitable phenols are the cresols, the methoxyphenols, the xylenols, the ethylphenols, the cumylphenols and the naphthols. Most preference is given to o cresol. When alcohol is used in addition to solvent preferably a solvent s alcohol s weight ratio in the treating liquid in the range of 1 1 to 2000 1, more preferably in the range of 2 1 to 200 1, is applied. The treatment s take s place at a temperature of, for instance, 250 425 K, preferably 330 380 K. The pressure is not critical and is, for instance, 10 1000 kPa. The amount of solvent is, for instance, 5 1000, preferably 10 100 grammes per gramme spray dried material. The product obtained after the electron donor and solvent treatment s is treated further with a liquid titanium IV halide. As stated earlier, the liquid titanium IV halide may be an undiluted titanium IV halide which is liquid of itself, or a liquid solution of a titanium IV halide in a suitable solvent. The solvent used for this titanium IV halide may be the same as mentioned above for the treat ment of the spray dried material. The treatment with the liquid titanium IV halide takes place at a temperature of, for instance, 250 425 K, preferably 320 370 K. The pressure is not critical and is, for instance, 10 1000 kPa. The amount of liquid titanium halide compound, expressed as mmole Ti per gramme product obtained after the electron donor and solvent treatment s , is, for instance, 1 1000 mmoles g, preferably 10 100 mmoles g. Amounts larger than 1 mole g can be used, but offer no advantage. After this treatment the virtually spherical catalyst par ticles formed are preferably re washed with an organic solvent. As such the same solvent are suitable as mentioned above for the washing out. In the finished polymerizion catalyst the virtually spherical catalyst particles are used in combination with an organo metallic component derived from a metal from one of the groups I III of the Periodic System with a hydrocarbon group bonded direct to the metal. Examples are trialkylaluminium compounds, alkylaluminiumalkoxides, alkylaluminiumhydrides, alkylaluminium halides, dialkylzinc compounds and dialkylmagnesium compounds. Of these the organoaluminium compounds are particularly suitable. Examples of the organoaluminium compounds are trialkylaluminium compounds or trialkenylaluminium compounds, for instance triethylaluminium, tripropylaluminium, triisobutylaluminium, triisoprenylaluminium, trihexylaluminium and trioctylaluminium alkyl aluminium siloxides alkylaluminium compounds, in which a number of the aluminium atoms are linked via an oxygen or nitrogen atom, for instance C₂H₅ ₂AlOAl C₂H₅ ₂, i C₄H₉ ₂AlOAl i C₄H₉ ₂ or C₂H₅ AlNHAl C₂H₅ ₂ dialkylaluminiumhydrides such as diethylalumi niumhydride or diisobutylaluminiumhydride dialkylaluminium halides, particularly a chloride or bromide, diethylaluminiumchloride and diethylaluminiumbromide being very suitable, but also other dialkyl aluminium halides with preferably 1 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, such as for instance di n butylaluminiumchloride and methyl n butylaluminiumchloride, can be used and dialkylaluminiumalkoxides or dialkylaluminiumphenoxides, for instance diethylethoxyaluminium or diethylphenoxyaluminium. Most preference should be given to the trialkylaluminium compounds. The organometallic compound may also contain a trialkylalumi nium compound as well as a dialkylaluminium halide or a mixture of a dialkylmagnesium compound and a monoalkylaluminium dihalide. The alkyl groups of the metalalkyl compounds preferably contain 1 10 carbon atoms each or are a palmityl group or stearyl group. The organometallic compound preferably comprises a complex of an organic metal compound, in particular a trialkylaluminium compound, with an ester of an oxygen containing organic acid. The ester may be the same as those that can be used also in the titanium component, particularly again the esters of aromatic carboxylic acids. Preferably a part, for instance 50 90 , of the organix metal compound is present in a non complexed state. The Al Ti atom ratio is generally between 50 and 1000 the molecule atom ratio of totally bonded Lewis base in the catalyst to Ti is generally between 1 and 200. The invention also comprises the process for polymerizing alkenes 1 and for copolymerizing alkenes 1 with each other and or with ethylene while applying a catalyst system comprising virtually spheri cal catalyst particles consisting at least of a halogenated titanium compound, an electron donor and a magnesium halide prepared by means of a spray drying technique and an organometallic component derived from a metal from one of the groups I III of the Periodic System of the Elements, the process being characterized in that the virtually spherical catalyst particles have been formed by subjecting a suspen sion of an intimate mixture of a magnesium halide and an aluminium halide containing at least 1 part by weight of aluminium per 15 parts by weight of magnesium to spray drying, subsequently treating the spray dried material with at least one electron donor and with at least one suitable solvent under such conditions that at least a part of the aluminium compound s present is washed out and treating the product thus obtained with liquid titanium IV halide. These virtually spherical catalyst particles have preferably also been re washed with an organic solvent. As such the same solvents are suitable in this process as mentioned above in the washing out. The polymerization process according to the invention is applied particularly in the stereospecific polymerization of alkenes 1 with 3 6 carbon atoms per molecule, such as propylene, butylene 1, 4 methylpentene 1 and hexene 1, and in the copolymerization of these alkenes 1 with each other and or with ethylene. Both copolymers with random distribution of the various monomer units and block copolymers can be prepared. If ethylene is used as comonomer, it is mostly incor porated by polymerization in minor amounts, for instance 30 wt at most, more specifically between 1 and 20 wt . The process according to the invention is particularly important for the preparation of iso tactic polypropylene, random copolymers of propylene with minor amounts of ethylene and block copolymers from propylene and ethylene. For the preparation of block copolymers any desired order of monomer addition can be applied. The polymers obtained by this process are virtually spherical and thus have e.g. much better flow properties than the non spherical and rough polymer particles obtained by using the normal non spherical catalyst particles. The circumstances in which the polymerization reaction in the polymerization process according to the invention is carried out do not differ from those known in the art. The reaction can be carried out in the gas phase or in the presence of a dispersant. The disper sant may be inert or be a monomer in a liquid form. Examples of suitable dispersants are aliphatic hydrocarbons with 3 8 carbon atoms per molecule, such as propylene, butylene 1, butane, isobutane, n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. In the polymerization in liquid phase the concentration of the titanium component should preferably be set at about 0.001 0.5 mmole, calculated as titanium atoms, and the concentration of the organometallic compound at about 0.1 50 mmoles, both per litre of liquid phase. The polymerization temperature is mostly between 190 and 475 K, preferably between 310 and 375 K. The pressure may be between for instance 100 and 3000 kPa. If so desired the molecular weight of the polymer can be adjusted during the polymerization, for instance by working in the presence of hydrogen or of another known molecular weight modifier. The polymerization reaction can be carried out batchwise as well as continuously. Into a nitrogen flushed three neck flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser 700 ml of a solution is introduced containing 0.26 mole ethyl butyl magnesium and 0.08 mole triethyl aluminium. A flow of dry HCl gas is introduced, resulting in the formation of a yellowish suspension. The suspension obtained is spray dried using a Büchi mini spraydryer 190 under nitrogen. The spray dried material obtained is virtually spherical. About 5 g of the spray dried material is suspended in 100 ml of a mixture of toluene and di isoamyl ether, the di isoamyl ether content of which is such that the suspension formed contains 1 molecu le di isoamyl ether per molecule aluminium. The temperature is raised to 353 K and maintained at this level for 2 hours. After this the suspension is filtered off and the solid substance is washed with water free gasoline at 333 K. The solid substance is subsequently suspended in 40 g TiCl₄. After the solid substance has been in contact with TiCl₄ for 2 hours at 353 K, the suspension is filtered off and washed with water free gasoline at 333 K. The titanium component thus obtained is finally dried. To a stainless steel reactor flushed with dry nitrogen and provided with a mechanical stirrer 2.3 l water free gasoline is supplied. Separately 2.00 mmoles triethyl aluminium, 0.5 mmole diethyl aluminium chloride, 0.5 mmole methyl p toluate and 121 mg of the tita nium component obtained according to I.A. are fed to the reactor. Sub sequently propylene is supplied up to a partial pressure of 200 KPa and the temperature of the reactor is brought to 293 K and maintained at this level for 10 minutes. After this prepolymerization the supply of hydrogen and propylene to the reactor is such that partial pressure of respectively 10 and 640 kPa are reached. The temperature of the reactor is brought to and maintained at 353 K. After 2 hours polymeri zation the polymer is separated off by centrifugation. The polymerization activity is 8340 g PP g titanium com ponent, the soluble polymer content is 9.2 and the bulk density is 0.31 g ml. The polymer particles obtained are virtually spherical. About 5 g of the spray dried material of the first part of I.A. is suspended in a mixture of 100 ml toluene, 8 ml o cresol and such a quantity of di isoamyl ether that the suspension formed con tains 133 molecules di isoamylether per 100 molecules aluminium. The temperature is raised to 353 K and maintained at this level for 2 20 hours. After this the suspension is filtered off and the solid substance is washed with water free gasoline at 333 K. The solid substance is subsequently suspended in 40 g TiCl₄. After the solid substance has been in contact with TiCl₄ for 2 hours at 353 K, the suspension is filtered off and washed with water free gasoline at 333 K. The titanium component thus obtained is finally dried. To a stainless steel reactor flushed with dry nitrogen and provided with a mechanical stirrer 2.3 l water free gasoline is supplied. Separately 2.00 mmoles triethyl aluminium, 0.5 mmole diethyl aluminium chloride, 0.5 mmole methyl p toluate and 97 mg of the tita nium component obtained according to II.A. are fed to the reactor. The polymerization takes place in the same way as in example I.B. The polymerization activity is 11240 gPP g titanium com ponent, the soluble polymer content is 11.4 and the bulk density is 0.30 g ml. The polymer particles obtained are virtually spherical. Into a nitrogen flushed three neck flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser 700 ml of a solution is introduced containing 0.26 mole ethyl butyl magnesium and 0.005 mol triethyl aluminium per litre. A flow of dry HCl gas is introduced, resulting in the formation of a yellowish suspension. The suspension obtained is spray dried using the same spray dryer as used in I.A. The spray dried material is not at all spherical and thus not suited for obtaining virtually spherical polymer particles.
