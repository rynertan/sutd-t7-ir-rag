# A mineral mining pick and holder assembly.

## Abstract
The combination of a mineral mining pick and a pick holder. The pick 1 has a shank 4 by which it is received in a socket 6 of a pick holder 2 . Extending within the socket 6 is a spigot 13 which mates with a coupling socket 14 in the shank 4 automatically as the shank is inserted into the pick holder. During insertion of the spigot 13 into the socket 14 , a frusto conical head 26 on the spigot passes through a resilient ring 25 mounted in an annular recess 24 of the coupling socket so that abutment of a shoulder 27 on the head 26 against the ring 25 retains the pick in the holder. The spigot 13 may be tubular to provide a water coupl ing from chamber 23 in the holder to passage 11 and ports 12 in the pick for flushing, cooling or dust suppression water supply. The resilient retaining ring 25 may provide a water seal between the spigot 13 and the socket 14 . In an alternative arrangement the spigot can be carried by the shank 4 to engage in a coupling socket in the holder 2 .
