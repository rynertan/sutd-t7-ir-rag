## Description
Calciferol derivatives The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of calciferol derivatives of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is hydrogen and the dotted line in the side chain is an optional additional C C bond, or R is methyl and the dotted line in the side chain is an additional C C bond.in the 25R or 25S epimeric form or as mixtures thereof. The invention also relates to novel compounds of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, in the 25R or 25S epimeric form or as mixtures thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of formulaI or IA, and to novel intermediates occurring in the preparation of these compounds. As used herein, the term 11lower alkyl denotes a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon group preferably containing from 1 to 6 C atoms, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl. butyl. t butyl, pentyl or hexyl. The term C3 6 alkylene denotes a straight or branched chain organic radical derived from an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, e.g. propylene or butylene. The term Iaaryitl denotes phenyl or phenyl bearing one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of C1 6 alkyl and C16 alkoxy. The process for preparing the compounds of formula I comprises reacting the corresponding specific epimer of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R and the dotted line in the side chain have the above significance and R1 and R are hydrogen, lower alkyl or aryl, or taken together are C3 6 alkylene.with a compound of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R3 is lower alkyl or aryl, and treating the obtained compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R3 and the dotted line in the side chain have the above significance, with a deprotecting agent. The reaction of a ketone II with a phosphine oxide III can be carried out in the presence of a base in a conventional ether solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran THF or dioxane, under an inert atmospher.e, e.g. of argon, at a temperature in the range of from about 80 to 500C. Exemplary of suitable bases are alkyl lithium compounds, e.g. n butyllithium, and alkali metal dialkyl or disilyl amides. The compound of formula IV can be purified, e.g. by elution chromatography on silica gel. The compound of formula IV can be converted to the corresponding compound of formula I by treatment with a deprotecting agent, such as an alkanol, e.g. ethanol, or water, in the presence of an acid. While any mineral acid or lower alkanoic or sulfonic acid may be used it is preferred to use a cationic ion exchange resin as a suspension in a lower alkanol. The corresponding compound of the formula I can be isolated by removal of the solid cationic exchange resin by filtration and evaporation of the volati les under reduced pressure. The starting ketones of formula II, wherein R is hydrogen, can be prepared as set forth in the following reaction sheme 1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as above, Reaction scheme 1EMI6.1 A compound of formula V can be reduced with lithium aluminum hydride LiAlH4 in an anhydrous conventional 0 ether solvent, e.g. THF, at 0 C, to give the corresponding diol VI. Conversion of the latter to the corresponding triolVII can be carried out by removal of the protecting group.e.g. the t butyl dimethylsilyl group, with a 48 aqueous hydrogen fluoride solution in a mixture of acetonitrile andTHF. Protection of the vicinal diol of the side chain in a compound of formula VII by conversion to the acetonide VIII can be accomplished by treatment, e.g. with 2,2 dimethoxypropane and catalyzed, e.g. with p toluenesulfonic acid.Conversion of the resulting compound of formula VIII to the dihydro analog of formula IX can be achieved by hydrogenation over a 10 palladium on carbon catalyst at atmospheric pressure in a solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate. Finally, the corresponding ketone II can be obtained by oxidation of a compound of formula VIII or IX, e.g. with 2,2 bipyridinium chlorochromate in a solvent, e.g. methylene chloride, and in the presence of anhydrous sodium acetate. The starting ketones of formula II, wherein R is methyl, can be prepared as set forth in the following reaction scheme 2 wherein R1 and R2 are as above and Ts is the p toluenesulfonyl group. Reaction scheme 2EMI8.1 The compound of formula X can be heated. e.g. with methyl mesaconate in an anhydrous conventional aromatic solvent. e.g. xylene, at 140 C, to give the isoxazolidine diester XI. Conversion of the latter to the corresponding diol XII can be carried out by reduction with LiAlH4 in an anhydrous conventional ether solvent, e.g. THF, at an ice bath temperature. Opening of the isoxazolidine ring to produce the compound of the formula XIII can be carried out by N methylation e.g. with methyliodide in toluene at 6O0C, followed by reduction, e.g. with zinc dust in acetic acid solution at room temperature. Alternatively, this reduction can be performed with LiAlH4 in THF.Protection of the vicinal diol of the side chain of the compound of formulaXIII by conversion to the acetonide XIV can be accomplished as described above for the compound of formula VII. Conversion of the compound of formula XIV to that of formula XV can be carried out by methylation with methyl iodide in dry toluene in the presence of potassium carbonate at 650C, followed by elimination effected e.g. with potassium t butylate at 550C and finally at 1000C. The compound of formulaXV is then converted to the tosylate XVI, e.g. with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in methylene chloride in the presence of triethylamine. Reduction of the compound of formula XVI to the compound of formula XVII can be carried out with LiAlH4 in THF at the reflux temperature.Finally, the ketone II can be obtained by oxidation of the compound of formula XVII, e.g. as described above for the compound of formula VIII or IX. The compounds of formula I have anti proliferative and differentiation inducing activity and are therefore useful as agents for the treatment of diffuse tumor, such as leukemias, e.g. monocytic and promyelocytic leukemias, as well as solid tumors, e.g. lung carcinomas, melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, and breast tumors, in warm blooded animals. The anti proliferative and differentiation inducing activity of the compounds of formula I can be demonstrated utilizing known procedures. e.g. as described in Progress inCancer Research and Therapy.
