# Package with a straw.

## Abstract
A package with a straw 2 comprises a rectangular paral lelepipedal package body 1 with a triangular flap 3 . The package body 1 is formed in such a manner that a single cylindrical paper material with its internal side being covered with a predetermined material is cut into a number of cylindri cal ones with a predetermined length, and at least one of the cross sections of the cut cylindrical one is press sealed and is formed into a rectangular cross section. A straw 2 is remov ably mounted along the diametrical line of the largest one of the six faces of the package. The package structure further comprises a straw insertion socket 5 in the package body covered by the triangular flap 3 .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A structure of a package with a straw, comprising a rectangular parallelepipedal package with a triangular flap 3 , formed in such a manner that a cylindrical paper material with the internal side thereof covered with a predetermined material is cut to a predetermined length, and at least one of the cut sections is press sealed and is formed into a rectangular section, and a straw 2 removably mounted along the diagonal line on the largest one of the six sides of the package, said structure further comprising a straw insertion socket 5 in the package portion covered by said triangular flap. 2. A rectangular parallelepipedal container for drinks having a straw 2 removably mounted along a diagonal line of one of the largest sides 1 and a straw insertion socket 5 , characterised in that the straw insertion socket is provided in a side that is not one of the smallest sides of the container.

## Description
PACKAGE WITH A STRAW The present invention relates to a paper pack structure, or more in particular to a structure of a rectangular parallelepipedal paper pack with a straw. A rectangular parallelepipedal package is fabricated by a well known method. First, a cylindrical member having an internal surface covered with a coating material such as plastics or a metal foil is cut at regular axial intervals in the direction perpendicular to the axis. One of the sectional sides is press sealed and this press sealed portion is formed into a rectangular section with a predetermined die, while triangular flap portions are formed and bent to a predetermined direction at the same time. Subsequently, a soft drink or alcohol beverage is filled in the package, after which the other sectional side is press sealed so that triangular flap portions are similarly formed and bent thereby to produce a rectangular parallelepiped package.At an appropriate time during the processes of fabrication of this package, a straw is removably mounted along a diametrical line on the front or back of the package. The rectangular parallelepipedal package with straw thus fabricated has a straw insertion socket in the upper or lower side thereof. This is inconvenient for drinking the content with the straw inserted into the socket. Specifically, the straw is only a little longer than the longitudinal length of the package as seen from the relation between hypotenuse and opposite sides of a triangle. In the typical case of a package 8.5 cm by 6.2 cm which is the size suitable for a commodity in Japan, the hypotenuse is 10.5 cm long. The longitudinal length of the package is different from the length of the straw only by about 2 Cm. This leads to the disadvantage that when the remaining content is small in amount, the straw is required to be inserted deeper into the package, thus making the package hard to handle especially for children and infants. The present invention has been developed in order to obviate this disadvantage, and the object thereof is to provide a package with straw comprising a straw socket formed in the left or right side of the package, especially, in the side portion coverted by the triangular flap. The above and other objects, features and advantages will be made apparent by the detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an assembly diagram showing a structure of a rectangular parallelepipedal package with straw according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is an expansion plan of the rectangularparallelepipedal package shown in Fig. 1. Now, explanation will be made with reference to the accompanying drawings. The diagram of Fig. 1 shows a rectangular parallelepipedal package with straw as fabricated according to the present invention. A development of the package of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2. Reference numeral 1 designates a rectangular parallelepipedal package paper pack of a cylindrical material like paper fabricated by a well known method. Numeral 2 designates a straw attached removably along the diagonal line on the front or back of the package by a well known method.Numeral 3 designates a triangular flap formed in the fabrication processes of the package 1, which flap is bent into close contact with the left or right side of the paper package 1. Numeral 4 designates a margin for presssealing the cylindrical material of the paper package 1 cut at predetermined lengths. Numeral 5 designates a straw socket provided in the left or right side of the package 1, which socket is formed in the left or right side portion covered by the triangular flap. Numeral 6 designates another margin for bonding a sheet of flat paper into a cylindrical construction. According to the present invention, a straw socket is formed in a side of the rectangular parallelepipedal package at a portion covered by the triangular flap, so that it is possible to secure the length of the straw portion exposed from the package twice that for the typical conventional package described above.As a result, various disadvantages such as drinking hardness, the content left untaken, the lip touching the package or the content easily slipping are eliminated.Further, the fact that the straw socket is formed under the cover of the triangular flap prevents dust or dirts from attaching to the package on the shelf, thus contributing to an improved sanitary situation. A paper package high in practical value is thus provided.
