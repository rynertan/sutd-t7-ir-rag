# Profile and feeding state detection apparatus for paper sheet.

## Abstract
The invention provides a profile and feeding state detec tion apparatus having a first counter 57 for counting widths of a first area, a second counter 59 for counting widths of a sec ond area, and a third counter 61 for counting widths of a third area. The first, second and third areas constitute a detection range and are perpendicular to the feeding direction of a paper sheet. A plurality of widths perpendicular to the feeding direc tion of the paper sheet are counted by the first, second and third counters 57, 59, 61 . Output signals from the first, sec ond and third counters 57, 59, 61 are stored in a RAM 75 . The values stored in the RAM 75 are read out by a CPU 63 which performs predetermined operations in accordance with a control program stored in a ROM 64 so as to determine the width of a sheet and the presence or absence of skew, mis alignment, a puncture or a dog ear.
