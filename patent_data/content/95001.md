# Production of whipping cream.

## Abstract
A method of making cream involves separating high and low melting point fractions from butter oil, and emulsifying one of the fractions with a low fat milk fraction enriched in membrane substances. Emulsification of the high melting point fraction can give whipping creams of low fat content and temperature sensitivity and good viscosity, especially if the cream is homogenised, pasteurised and then homoge nised again and if the cooled cream is tempered by warming and recooling. Emulsification of the low melting fat fraction yields cream churnable to butter which spreads at refriger ator temperatures. The low fat milk fraction may be the serum separated in the production of the butter oil, but there may be used instead or in addition buttermilk or butter serum from another source. The butter fat fraction may be emulsified together with a non milk fat.

## Description
DAIRY PROCESS This invention relates to the production and use of dairy emulsions, e.g. cream. Conventional whipping creams whip best at refrigerator temperatures, e.g. 4 to 60C, not perfornffng as well at higher temperatures. This temperature sensitivity is reduced somewhat with increase in the fat content of the cream, but increased fat content has the disadvantages of increased calorific content, reduced overrun volume increase on whipping , and that buttering off or churning of the cream on whipping becomes a problem. In general, winter milk produces better whipping creams than summer milk, and dairies frequently produce a higher fat content e.g. 38 whipping creem in summer to achieve comparability with their winter cream e.g. of 3G fat content . By the method of the present invention it is possible to produce whipping creams of reduced temperature sensitivity, even at low fat content, obviating the need for fat content variations over tie year and in general reducing the need for high fat content creams with their various dis,ddvantages. The invention also permits the product ion of butter and like water in oil emulsions which will spread at refrigerator temperatures. According to the present invention, a dairy emulsion is produced by separating from butter oil a high melting point fraction and a low melting point fraction, and emulsifying one of these fractions with an aqueous low fat milk fraction enriched in membrane substances. Such emulsification of the high melting point butter fat fraction can yield a satisfactory whipping cream of low fat content which whips well at relatively high temperatures near room temperature e.y. 10 12 C or even about 15 C or higher . If the low melting point fat fraction is emulsified, a cream can be obtained which can be churned to yield a butter which will spread at refrigerator temperatures e.g. 4.60C . By a low fat milk fraction enriched in membrane substances is meant an extract or mixture of extracts from milk or from liquid or solid emulsions derived from milk e.g. cream, butter and having a higher concentration of membrane substances than milk. Preferably, the low or high melting point butter fat fraction is emulsified with serum obtained by the separation of the initial unfractionated butter oil from milk or cream, but this serum may be wholly or partly replaced by other low fat milk fractions of enriched membrane substance content, e.g. acid or sweet butter milk or butter oil serunl from another source, in original liquid form or made up from powder. For the emulsification of the low molting point butter fat fraction1 it is also possible to use acid or sweet whey, natural or reconstituted from powder, from a conventional cheese making process. The butter oil fractions may be used in admixture with nonmilk fat s to give filled products, examples of suitable non milk fats being ground nut, coconut and palm kern ails. The butter fractionation conducted according to the invention can for example be at between 15 and 25 or 300C or even higher. At 200C to 240C, e.g. about 22 C, the fractionation often allows separation of about equal weights of the high and low melting point fractions. For some purposes it may be advantageous to fractionate twice at different temperatures, e.g. at about 150C and about 250C, and to combine the highest and lowest melting point fractions obtained this mixture can be suitable for forming by the above described method according to the invention a low fat cream which may whip well at relatively high temperatures, e.g. up to room temperature the middle fraction can be emulsified and made into readily spreadable butter by the method according to the invention. For the production according to the invention of a low fat e.g. as low as 10 whipping cream, however, it is generally preferred to employ the high melting point fraction of a relatively high temperature e.g. about 280C butter oil fractionation. The lower and or middle melting point butter fractions obtained in the fractionation step of the invention can be emulsified according to the invention and used in conventional manner in the manufacture of soft cheese or ice cream, and the high fat fraction can be so emulsified for use in hard cheese production. Low fat cream made according to the invention using the high melting point butter raction can be dried to a powder which is reconstitutable to cream e.g. with water , e.g. whipping cream. SuitableapparRtus for the separation of butter cil into different melting point fractions is commercially available, e.g. theAlfa Laval anhydrous milk fat fractionator. With such apparatus, the melting points of the fractions obtained can be varied at will, though in some cases adjustment of melting point and product properties may best be achieved, e.g. as indicated above, by mixing some of one fraction with another. Emulsification of the resulting selected butter oil fraction s with the aqueous fraction is conveniently conducted, preferably at about 50 to 600C, e.g. 5500, in an emulsion tank provided with a high speed mixer e.g. a circulatory pump such as a centrifugal milk pump.Additional emulsifier s and or stabiliser s may be incorporated for emulsion formation, but are not essential. Creams made according to the invention mainly when using a high melting point fat fraction are preferably subjected to a treatment which comprises homogenisation preferably at a relatively high pressure e.g. 100 to 600 Kg cmê , then pasteurisation or UI3T treatment, then if needed or wanted e.g. for viscosity reduction further homogenisation preferably at lower pressure e.g. 30 to 100 Kg cmê . This procedure permits good control to be maintained over the viscosity, whippability, stability and taste of the final product, and is particularly advantageous in the case of low fat emulsions. Lower fat emulsions generally need or allow higher temperature pasteurisation. However, the optimum homogenisation pressures especially the first and pasteurisation time and temperature may vary with the pH of the emulsion which can for example be adisted with dilute lactic acid suitable conditions can be ascertained, for each given emulsion, by trial. Conventional piston homogenisers are suitably used, and the pasteuriser or steriliser may also be of conventional e.g. plate heat exchanger or spiral trlbe steam cylinder heat exchanger type. In order to achieve optimum properties e.g. reliable whipping with improved whIpped product firmness, stability and taste in the case of creams, especially low fat creams , emulsions obtained according to the invention may need to be tempered this involves cooling the emulsion usually to about refrigerator temperature, i.e.about 4 or 60C, this being normal as the cream would usually be stored chilled , and then warming generally to 20 320C and cooling it again ususally to about refrigerator temperature . The tempering may for example extend over a total period of about 2 hours. The aximum emulsion temperature will usually be lower e.g. 24 C for low melting point butter oil fraction emulsions and higher e.g. 280C for high melting point butter oil fraction emulsions. All parts and percentages herein are by weight unless otherwise stated. The following are specific Examples of the production and further treatment of cream by the method of the invention, and are given by way of illustration only. A con entional 35t35t pasteurised cream was trade from milk. This cream was then subjected to a complete phase inversion using a clarifixator to separate off butter oil with a fat content of approximately 992. This was then fractionated by holding at 200C until partial crystallisation occurred, then separated in a centrifuge to give high and low melting point fat fractions. The high KP fat fraction was then emulsified with sufficient serum from the phase inversion process to produce a 35 fat content cream.After pasteurisation and packing and holding for 24 hours at chill temper ature, this cream gave a good and stable whip with a volume increase of approximately 1008 at 12 C. Example 2Cream of 55 fat content was produced from milk and subjected to complete phase inversion in a clarifixator to separate butter oil, fractionatior of the butter oil then being carried out as in Example 1 but at a temperature of 240C. Sufficient of the high MP fat fraction obtained was then emulsified with serum from the phase inversion process to produce a 22 fat content cream. This cream was then processed by subjecting it to 2 stage homogenisation 0 single stage homogenisation at llOkg cm , pasteurisation at 99 C for 15 2 seconds and a further single stage homogenisation at 40kg cm . After cooling and holding for 24 hours at chill temperatures 4 C this cream gave a firm and stable whip with a volume increase of 140 1608 at 100C.The whipped product was suitable for piping and decoration, Example 3Starting from a 558 fat content cream1 a 20 fat content cream containing the high MP fat fraction was made as in Example 2. is cream was then processed by subjecting it to single stage homogenisation at 130kg cm2, UHT sterilisation at 14 C for 5 seconds, and then cooling to 70 C before a further single stage homogenisation at 45kg cmê . rafter aseptic packing and holding for 4 days, this cream produced a very stable whip w a volute increase of 150 170 at 120C. The whipped product was suitable for decoration and piping. 1o4 A high molting point fat fraction cream was made as in Example 1. tie low MS fat fraction from the fractionation process was emulsified with serum from the phase inversion process to produce a 358 fat content cream.This cream was pasteurised, cooled and then conventionally churned at 100C 0 to give a butter which was spreadable at refrigeration temperatures 4 6 C . Example 5A high MP fat fraction produced as in Example 2 was mixed with coconut oil in a ratio of 1 1 prior to emulsifying with serum from the phase inversion process to produce a cream like emulsion having a 25 total fat content.After treatment as in Example 2, this cream like emulsion gave a firm and stable whip with a volume increase of 130 150 at 10 C.Example 6A low MP fat fraction produced as in Example 4 was mixed with ground nut oil in the ratio 3 2 prior to emulsifying with serum from the phase inversion process, to produce a cream like emulsion having a 35 total fat content.This cream like emulsion was pasteurised and cooled, then churned at 5 C to give a butter like product which was spreadable at refrigeration temperatures 4 6 C and which had improved nutritional characteristics compared wlth convetional butter.Example 7 Butter oil was obtained.and fractionated as in Example 2 but at a fractionation temperature of 250C. The high melting point fraction was emulsified with water and sweet cream buttermilk powder to give a cream containing about 20 fat and 7.8t non fat milk solids. The emulsion was formed at about 550C in an emulsion tank with a centrifugal milk pump, with the following proportions of ingredients Butter fat 39.87 parts by weight Sweet Cream Buttermilk Powder 17.41 parts by weight Water 142.72 parts by weightThe pH of the cream was adjusted from 6.64 to 6.46, and the cream was then homogenised at 300 Kg cmê, pasteurised at about 109 C, and then homogenised again at 40 Kg cmê.The resulting cream whilst slowly stirred in a vessel was cooled to 40C and then tempered by heating to 28 C and subsequently cooling again to 4 C.The pH adjustment in this Example, and in the practice of this invention in general, may be by the addition of dilute lactic acid, the addition of cultured buttermilk or skimmed milk, or by innoculation with lactic acid producing culture. On whipping for 107 seconds at a starting temperature of 9.40C and final temperature of 14.40C, the tempered cream showed a stable overrun of 121 and the whipped product was firm and of excellent taste.Example 8Butter oil was obtained and fractionated as in Example 2 but at a fractionation temperature of 280C. 5.15 Kg of the resulting high melting point fraction was emulsified as in Example 7 with 5.05 Kg of sweet buttermilk powder and 34.80 Kg of water to give a cream of pH 6.35 containing about 12 butter fat and about 10 non fat milk solids. This was homogenised at 60 Kg cmê , pasteurised at about 120 C, cooled to 4 C and then tempered as in Example 7. The tempered cream when whipped for 210 seconds gave a stable, Eirm product of good taste with iul overrun of 174 . Example 9Butter oil was obtained and fractionated as in Example 2 but at a fractionation temperature of 280C. 6.53 Kg of the resulting high melting point fraction was emulsified as in Example 7 with 470 Kg of sweet buttermilk powder and 34.22 Kg of water to give a cream containing about 15 wt. butter fat and about 9.3 wt. non fat milk solids, the cream pH being adjusted to 6.20 6.25 with lactic acid.
