## Description
Method, device and mould for the manufacture of concrete tubes. The invention relates to a method of manufacturing concrete tubes of angular cross section adapted to join one another by means of a sleeve wedge joint, the tube being manufactured in the following steps A assembling a mould comprising a core, a jacket and a bottom, said core, jacket and bottom bounding a mould cavity B filling the mould cavity with concrete mortar andC densifying the concrete mortar to a casting, the mould being subjected to vibrations. The tubes manufactured by said known method appear to be less strong on their top side than on their bottom side. Therefore, the concrete quality and hence the percentage of binder to be employed have to be chosen so that the top ends of the tubes are sufficiently strong, whereas the lower ends are stronger than is required. The invention has for its object to reduce the difference in tube strength between top and bottom. For this purpose in step C an upper mould part is pressed in the axial direction of the mould cavity into the position bounding the mould cavity, whilst the mould is subjected to vibrations. In this way the density obtained above and below in the mould cavity is more uniform because the lower static pressure prevailing below in the mould cavity is compensated by the pressing force of the top mould part, said pressing force having greater effect above in the mould cavity and gradually less further down in the mould cavity. Preferably the upper mould part, which is pressed home during step C is narrower than the wall thickness of the tube. Particularly, when the mould is filled with concrete mortar up to an upper rim and subsequently an upper mould part narrower than the wall thickness of the pipe is pressed into its position bounding the mould cavity, the degree of filling can be better adjusted to be desired value, whilst the final, predetermined, preferred pressure force can be more readilv obtained. The invention relates to a method of manufacturinq concrete tubes, each having a plurality of lonqitudinal channels in the tube wall, each tube being obtained in the following steps A assembling a mould comprising a core, a jacket, at least one upper mould part, a bottom and recessing elements extending between the bottom mould part and the bottom, said core, jacket and bottom bounding a mould cavity accomodating the recessing elements B filling the mould cavity with the concrete mortar andC densifying the concrete mortar. In the known method the recessing elements are formed by lost casing elements, for example, of synthetic resin.These elements are expensive and can be positioned only with difficulty. The invention provides an improvement of the method in this respect. Hereir during the consolidation of the concrete mortar the recessing elements are each resiliently supported between the bottom and the upper mould part. The invention furthermore provides an improved me thod of removing a casting out of the mould with S 282sk of damage. According to the invention the jacket is removed from the casting by moving it upwards with respect to the casting, which is urged downwards during the first part of said relative movement by means of a pressing rim matching the top edge of the casting. When during the curing period the casting is supported in a horizontal direction by means of a supporting rim covering the casting and having a side, preferably an inner and outer side supporting the casting in a horizontal sense, the supporting rim highly improves the deformation resistance of the casting. Preferably this supporting rim is arranged on the mould for transport to the curing space. The invention furthermore provides a device and mould defined in the claims for carrying out the method embodying the invention. The aforesaid and further features of the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to a drawing. The drawing schematically shows in Figures 1 to 6 vertical sectional views each of a fraction of a mould embodying the invention for the manufacture of concrete tubes in successive stages of the method in accordance with the invention, whilst a device embodying the invention is employed, Figure 7 a plan view of a tube to be manufactured in accordance with the invention, Figure 8 a vertical sectional view of the mould ofFigures 1 to 6 taken on the line A A in Figure 6 of the tube, Figures 9 and 10 a different device and a different mould embodying the invention in two consecutive stages of the method in accordance with the invention and Figure 11 on an enlarged scale detail XI of a casting of Figure 10 in a further stage of the method embodying the invention. Referring to Figure 1, a vibrating table 11 provided with vibrators 14 bears through springs 12 on a floor 13.On the vibratory table 11 first a mould 2 is assembled, a core 3 of which is fastened by means of a flange 15 and bolts VVOi 9LV 16 to the vibratory table 11. Around said core is put a bottom 5, which joins the core 3 by means of a sealing ring 17 and which has at the top the configuration of a tube sleeve.Previously the required reinforcing elements not shown and the jacket 4 are arranged on the bottom 5. At the top end the jacket 4 has a top ring rigidly secured thereto by means of bolts 19 and forming an outer mould part 18 and having a downwardly converging shape. The jacket 4 is secured by means of high bolts 20 and nuts 21 to the vibratory table 11, whilst a flange 22 of the bottom 5 is clamped between. In the method embodying the invention the mould 2 is assembled in this way in the first step A , the core 3, the bottom 5, the jacket 4 and the top ring 18 thus bounding a mould cavity 6 corresponding to the configuration of an angular tube 1 shown in Figure 7. In the next step B this mould 2 is filled with concrete mortar 7 up to the top edge 3, said mortar having a high degree of moisture. In the following step C the concrete mortar 7 is densified to form a casting 8, whilst the mould 2 is subjgc ted to vibrations by means of the vibrators 14 and an upper mould part 9 is urged by means of pressing means 25 in an axial direction of the mould cavity 6 in the direction of the arrow 10 into its position bounding the mould cavity 6 as is illustrated in Figure 2. The top ring 18 and the upper mould part 9 having a width g smaller than the wall thickness f of the tube 1 define in common the configuration of the wedge of the tube 1 so that identical tubes 1 having the conventional sleeve wedge joint can join one another with the interposition of an elastic sealing ring to form a continuous pipeline. The inner upper mould part 9 has a downwardly converging inner side 42 to form a bevelled top rim 43 of the casting 84. The device 24 for manufacturing tubes 1 by the method according to the invention is provided, apart from the mould 2, with pressing means 25 consisting, as shown in Figure 2, of a pressing frame 26 to which traction means formed by pivotable hooks 27 are suspended, said means gripping around the edges 28 of the jacket 4 and having fastened to them hydraulic rams 29, the feet 30 of which upon energization of the rams 29 press downwards the upper mould part 9 arranged around the core 3 until they come into contact with the top ring 18. Thus, in particular, the top zone of the concrete mortar 7 is densified so that the densification thereof corresponds more with the satisfactory densification below in the mould 2 enhanced by the higher hydrostatic pressure. The mould 2 may be vibrated already during step B . Figure 8 shows that the mould 2 may comprise a plurality of recessing elements 31 for the formation of tensioning channels 32 Figure 7 . These recessing elements 31 extend between an outer upper mould part formed by the top ring 18 and the bottom 5. Each of them bears by means of an annular lower rim 33 on a conical supporting element 34 of the bottom 5. Each recessing element 31 is supported by spring means 35 on the top ring 18 since at the top end each of them has a shoulder 36 and a screwthreaded end 37 surrounded by pressurized helical spring 38 bearing on a stop plate 39 fastened to the top ring 18. By means of a nut 40 the recessing element 31 formed by a downwardly converging pin is loosely suspended to the top ring 18. Above the shoulder 36 this pin is closed by means of sealing rings 41 and slidably arranged in a lubricant containing chamber 62.In a simple manner the tensioning channels 32 can thus be recessed without additional manipulations. Figure 3 to 5 illustrate the successive manipulations for removing the core 3 and the jacket 4 from the casting 8 Figure 6 during step D . Figure 3 shows the removal of the core 3. By lifting means 45 comprising a lifting frame 46 with pivotable hooks 47 and hydraulic rams 48 the casting 8 is lifted from the core 3 whilst the pivotable hooks 47, the bolts 20 being loosened, grip below the bottom 5 and the pressing rods 49 of the rams 48 exert heavy pressure on the upper mould part 9. The casting 8 free of the core 3 is put down, as shown in Figure 4, with its bottom 5 on a floor 50 of a steam chamber.Then the pivotable hooks 47 are hooked below a collar 51 ot the jacket 4 and the jacket 4 together with the outer upper mould part 18 is removed from the casting 8 by drawing it upwards with respect to the casting 8 with the aid of the hooks 47, whilst during the first part of this relative movement the casting 8 is subjected to downward pressure via a pressing ring matching the top edge 52 of the casting 8 and formed in this case preferably by the upper mould part 9. When the first part of this relative movement is performed and the jacket 4 smoothly slides along the casting 8, pressure need no longer be exerted so that the pressing rods 49 disengage the upper mould part 9. The casting 8 is left on the floor 50 of the steam chamber as is shown inFigure 6.The upper rim 43 remains satisfactorily supported in a radial direction by means of the upper mould part 9, which covers, like a supporting rim, the casting 8 and supports the upper rim 43 of the casting 8 by means of an inner side 42 and an outer side 54. In order to restrict the number of solid, expensive mould parts 9 in the case of series production of tubes 1 they are preferably replaced after the stage illustrated inFigure 5 by less expensive rings 55, an example of which is shown in Figure 11. The casting 8 thus supported is little susceptible of deforming during the subsequent step E of steam curing the casting 8, in which additional moisture from the steam chamber is imparted to the fairly dry concrete mortar 7. Figures 9 and 10 show how with the aid of a different lifting device 56 an integral upper mould part 57 is urged into its position bounding the mould cavity. Pivotable hooks 58 grip below the bottom 5 and whilst turning, each hook 58 engages an angle lever 59, which is energized by a hydraulic ram 60. The angle lever 59 and the pivotable hooks 58 are proportioned and the angle lever 59 is journalled on a pressure frame 61 so that upon energization of the ram 60 the upper mould part 57 rigidly connected with the pressure frame 61 is pressed into its position bounding the mould cavity.Then by means of lifting members not shown the pressure frame 61 together with the mould parts 4, 5 and 57 can be litted trom the core 3. Referring to Figure 11 the ring 55 has a configuration matching the casting 8 of Figures 9 and 10 i.e. the upper mould part 57.
