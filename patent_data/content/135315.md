## Description
AntiSerspir.snt rint crems This invention is directed to a creamy, heterogell eous, anhydrous antiperspirant product and a method f making it. Antiperspirant compositions in the form of creams have heretofore been primarily oil in water or waterin oil emulsions. Though these provide convenient vehicles for carrying and delivering the astringent, emulsions generally tend to produce undesirable sensations on the skin, such as a sticky, wet feeling. Anhydrous antiperspirant creams essentially comprising a liquid organic emollient material, an inorganic clay thickening suspending agent, a gel pvomoting agent and an astringent are also known. See SheltonUS A 4,083,956. These also tend to produce undesirable sensations on the skin, will tend to remain on the skin and will cause stains on fabrics which come into contact with the product. Antiperspirant stick products are also well known in the prior art. Davy et al. US A 4,126,679, for example, describes antiperspirant stick products made by suspending an astringent in a solid solution of volatile silicones and long chain alcohols. Prior art methods for preparing antiperspirant compositions tend to vary depending on whether the desired product is a stick or a cream. Shelton US A 4,083,956, for example, describes a method of preparing the thixotropic creams described there. In the described method of preparation, the emollient and optional ingredients soluble therein are mixed together. The clay suspending thickening agent is added and mixed with an agitator to provide a uniform composition. Gel promoting and anti syneresis agents then are added until gellation occurs. At that point, antiperspirant active ingredients are blended into the mixture and uniformly dispersed.Apparently, no heating of the ingredients is necessarv or desirable to prepare the Shelton products. Davy et al. US A 4,126,679 and Elsnau US A 4,049,792 describe methods for making the antiperspirant sticks described there. Briefly, the ingredients are mixed together and melted, the astringent is added and intermixed and the resulting uniform product is poured into the stick form, at a temperature which is above the normal solidification point, and is allowed to cool to the normal solidification point of the product, and further to room temperature, without further agitation or mixing. It has now been found, quite unexpectedly, that a more acceptable, efficacious, creamy antiperspirant product than those heretofore available or known may be made in accordance with the invention of the present application. The product of the invention provides a drier feeling than the prior art antiperspirant creams, imparts no sticky feeling whatever and does not cool the skin, as the prior art products do, after being applied thereto. Furthermore, it appears that the method employed in making the antiperspirant creams of the present invention is unexpectedly suitable to make the creams described herein.This invention is directed to a creamy, heterogeneous, anhydrous antiperspirant composition comprising the following essential ingredients about 30 to about 70 all percentages areby weight of total product of a volatile silicone product as a carrier, about 7 to about 30 of a suitable gelling agent or agents, and about 12 to about 30 of a physiologically acceptable antiperspirant agent. This invention is also directed to a method of making the product of the invention. The carrier, for example, can be any volatile, low viscosity silicone product, either cyclic or open chain, or combinations thereof. The gelling agent can be any of a number of compositions, including, for example, hydrogenated vegetable oil, hydrogenated castor oil, fatty acids, beeswax, paraffin wax, fatty alcohols, polyethylene and the like, or combinations thereof. The antiperspirant agent can be any of the usual types of astringents, such as aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium chlorohydrate, or the like. Apart from the above identified ingredients, i.e.the carrier, the gelling agent and the antiperspirant agent, it is desirable to include one or more optional ingredients in the creamy antiperspirant product of the invention. These optional ingredients together can comprise up to about 25 of the total product. Useful optional ingredients include surfactants, fillers, emollients, fragrances and coloring agents, for example. Surfactants can comprise up to about 5 of the total product and aid in preventing stains on clothing and in washing out any stains which do form. Fillers can comprise up to about 20 of the total product and are normally less costly than the essential components of the product, thus reducing the overall cost. Emollients can comprise up to aboutlS of the total product, and, though not essential ingredients, are useful particularly when hydrogenated castor oil also known as castor wax is used as the gelling agent. Fragrances can comprise up to about 1 of the total product. Coloring agents can be added as desired. The method of the invention comprises, very briefly, heating and thoroughly mixing all ingredients, then cooling the resultant mixture below the normal solidification point thereof, while subjecting the product to continuous shearing, agitation or mixing action. This process produces the creamy heterogeneous, anhydrous antiperspirant product of the invention. In practice, it has been found that a commercially available device called a VotatorScraped Surface Heat Exchanger, available from several sources, for example, Chemetron Corporation of Louisville,Kentucky, is useful, but not necessary, in practicing the method of the invention. As stated above, one essential ingredient of the invention is a carrier, which comprises a volatile silicone product. The preferred volatile silicone products according to the invention are in general polydimethylcyclosiloxanes having 3 to 6 silicon atoms and linear polydimethyl siloxanes having a viscosity of not more than 10 centistokes at 250C. Such products are commercially available from several manufacturers and include the tetrameric and pentameric dimethyl cyclosiloxanes also known as cyclomethicones having the structures EMI4.1 as well as linear compounds such as hexamethyl disiloxane H3C 3Si 0 Si CH3 3. The carrier comprises about 30 to about 70 of the total product, and preferably about 45 to about 65 . The carrier of choice is cyclomethicone, which is a polydimethylcyclosiloxane. The gelling agent is another essential ingredient of the invention, comprises about 7 to 30 of the total product, and preferably about 7 to about 20 . Useful gelling agents include fatty alcohols having from 14 to 24 carbon atoms, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, fatty acids having from 14 to 36 carbon atoms, fatty acid ethylene glycol esters, glyceryl tribehenate, beeswax, paraffin wax, polyethylene and the like. These gelling agents are available from many wellknown chemical companies, including Emery, Vaschem Inc.,Procter Gamble, Croda, Allied Chemical and the like. The gelling agent of preference is a combination of stearyl alcohol and hydrogenated castor oil, which is available as Castorwax MP 70 from Caschem. CastorwaxMP 80 is a useful substitute for the MP 70. The physiologically acceptable antiperspirant agent is the third essential ingredient of the invention, comprises about 12 to about 30 of the total product, and preferably about 18 to about 25 . Antiperspirant compositions of necessity contain an effective antiperspirant agent. The number and composition of these agents is controlled in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration and the number of proposed agents is currently rather limited. They are in general aluminum or aluminum zirconium salts or complexes. See 47 Federal Register 36504, 20 August 1982.They include aluminum chloride, aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chlorohydrex, aluminum chlorohydrex PEG, aluminum chlorohydrex PG, aluminum dichlorohydrate, aluminum dichlorohydrex PEG, aluminum dichlorohydrex PG, aluminum sesquichlorohydrate, aluminum sesquichlorohydrex PEG, aluminum sesquichlorohydrex PG, aluminum sulfate, aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex GLY, aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium pentachlorohydrex GLY, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrate, aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate GLY, aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrate GLY. See CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Third Edition, pp. 10 13, 279. The term physiologically acceptable is used to mean a material which may be used in cosmetic drug preparations for external use without violation of the appropriate regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration. The preferred physiologically acceptable antiperspirant agent is aluminum chlorohydrate. A suitable alternative for this is aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrexGLY hereafter Al Zr TC GLY . These agents are powders and have a preferred particle size of about 1 to about 100 microns. Useful optional ingredients include surfactants which, when present, can comprise up to 5 of total product, and preferably about 2 . Useful surfactants will have hydrophilic lipophilic balances HLB of about 10 to about 20. Nonionic surfactants with HLBs of 12 20 are preferred. The commercially available surfactant of choice is Arlacel 165, which is a mixture of glyceryl stearate and polyethylene glycol 100 stearate. Other useful surfactants are those of the Tween series ethoxylated sorbitol monoesters having different degrees of ethoxylation to provide different HLBs , the Myrj series, the Brij series and the Atlas series. All of these sur factants are commercially available from ICI United States and are well known. Other useful optional ingredients are fillers, which, wilen present, can comprise up co about 20 of the total product and preferably about iso . Useful fillers include talc, aluminum. stearate, aluminum tristearate, zinc stearate, calcium carbonate, calcium stearate and the like.Talc is preferred. Other useful optional ingredients are emollients, which, when present, can comprise up to about 15 of the total product and preferably about 8 . An emollient is particularly useful when hydrogenated castor oil is used as the gelling agent or one of the gelling agents.The preferred emollient is fluid AP, which is commercially available and comprises the condensation product of about fourteen moles of propylene oxide with one mole of butanol also known as polypropylene glycol 14 butyl ether . Other useful optional ingredients are fragrances, which, when present, can comprise up to about 1 of the total product, and preferably about 0.5 . Coloring agents are well known optional ingredients which may also be present in amounts of less than about 0.1 . The folicwirg formulations exemplify the creamy products of the invention, all percentdges being by weight of total product. Ingredient Formulation 1 2 3 Cyclomethicone 52.5 54.0 59.80 Stearyl alcohol 24.0 7.2 6.25 Castorwax MP 70 0.0 4.7 4.10 Aluminum Chlorohydrate 22.0 0.0 0.00 Al Zr TC GLY 0.0 22.0 19.15 Arlacel 165 1.0 1.0 1.00 Fluid AP 0.0 5.0 4.35 Talc 0.0 5.6 4.85 Fragrance 0.5 0.5 0.50 The method of the present invention comprises mixing and heating all ingredients except the fragrance, if any, to a temperature about the melting point of the gelling agent, cooling while the mixing is continued to approximately 55 650C., adding the fragrance, if any, while continuing to mix, then cooling further while still mixing or agitating the product, or subjecting it to shear to a temperature below the normal solidification point of the product, which is approximately in the range 44 520C., for the indicated composition ranges.The product preferably is then charged into the pushup type applicators described more fully below, and is allowed to come to room temperature. The above method can be performed by hand using suitable heaters, mixers and cooling baths, etc. The term normal solidification point as used herein means that temperature at which the product, when cooled without mixing or shearing, will ordinarily solidify to a block type product. In performing the method of the invention, it is preferred to use a commercial heat exchanger mixer known as a Votator Scraped Surface Heat Exchanger to perform the step of cooling the product below the normal solidification point. This device is described more fully in bulletins available from one of the manufacturers, Chemetron Corporation, such as Bulletin V300. This device provides a very simple means for continuous thorough mixing of the product while it is being cooled to the desired temperature. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, the normal solidification point of the products of the invention will vary depending upon the actual carriers and gelling agents employed, and the amounts used of each. It is believed that the method of the invention prevents the product from forming a solid matrix at its normal solidification point by continuous thorough mixing of the product as it cools to and below its normal solidification point. The product thus produced is a creamy heterogeneous, anhydrous antiperspirant suitable for packaging in jars or tubes. Another suitable package, and that preferred for the products of the invention, is a push up type applicator, i.e. a tubular container having a piston advanced by a screw mechanism operated at the base thereof. The top of the tube may be closed by a perforated cap, with a cover being provided to seal the cap when not in use. Advance of the piston squeezes some of the product through the perforations onto the cap, whence it can be applied to the underarm. It has also now been found that when the products of the invention are produced using the method of the invention, the products are creamy and do not readily separate. When the Standard Test Method for Cone Penetration of Petrolatum ASTM D937 77 is performed on the products of the invention, the products exhibit a penetration value of about 10 to about 36 mm. That standard method is hereby incorporated by reference. Preferably, the products will exhibit a value of about 12 to about 20 mm. When the same combinations of ingredients as those of the invention are prepared but are allowed to cool to below the normal solidification points without continuous agitation or mixing, the cone penetration values are much lower, namely, in the range of about 2 to about 8 mm.
