# HOLLOW WAVEGUIDE HAVING PLURAL LAYER DIELECTRIC

## Abstract
A hollow waveguide has an inner reflective layer such as silver, overcoated with plural layers of dielectric. Preferably three dielectric layers are used, with the inner two having quarter wave thickness, and the outer one having one half on one and one half the quarter wave thickness. Compositions for the dielectric include ThF₄ Ge ThF₄, ZnSe Ge ZnSe, Ge ThF₄ Ge, and ThF₄ ZnSe ThF₄.
