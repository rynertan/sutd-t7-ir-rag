# GRAY SCALE IMAGE THRESHOLDING METHOD

## Abstract
A method is described for reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted over a telecommunications link in order to generate an acceptable video image of a bilevel document at a remote monitor. Document data is captured at 8 bits pel with a conventional video freeze frame system. The captured data is normalized to eliminate variations due to camera settings, room lighting levels and the like. A table lookup process is used to threshold the data to 4 bits pel with different single pel values being assigned to pels having normalized normalized values above or below set threshold values. The number of intermediate gray scale ranges is reduced. The thresholding process provides log strings of constant pel values while suppressing small nonuniformities in the document s background. The resultant data is opti mized for run length compression and the image quality is improved. At the receiver, a second table lookup process is used to define playback values. To provide optimum contrast between characters and background, the table lookup values at the receiver may be different from those used in the compression process.
