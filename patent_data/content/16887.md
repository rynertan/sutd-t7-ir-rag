# Gas sterilization method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Goods are heated and moistened prior to addition of the sterilizing gas utilizing repressurization after initial evacuation to provide drive power for the conditioning vapour and improve conditioning efficiency. After initial evacuation to a selected subatmospheric pressure of 8 10³ Pa level, the sterilizing chamber is repressurized with a conditioning vapour steam to a subatmospheric pressure level of 12 10³ Pa correspond ing approximately to desired sterilizing temperature, then the chamber is held with evacuating and vapour injecting interrupt ed for a predetermined interval this sequence of steps is re peated a selected number of times and conditioning to vari ous sterilizing temperatures is available. Initial evacuation can be accompanied by intermittent injection of conditioning va pour. No chamber measurement of temperature or relative hu midity is required for conditioning control and conditioning va pour injection is free of flow rate control requirements.
