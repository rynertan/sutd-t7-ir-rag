# Power transmitting device in a copying machine.

## Abstract
A power transmitting device especially suitable for use in photocopying machines includes a driving shaft 38 and a driven shaft 29 . When locking members 37, 32 on the respective shafts are axially disengaged from each other, the driven shaft 29 and the driving shaft 38 are rotatively displaced with respect to each other by a predetermined angle so that the locking members may be freely and positively locked when the driving shaft and driven shaft are axially reengaged.
