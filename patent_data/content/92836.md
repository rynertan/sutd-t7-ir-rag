DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The line adapter read control operations system of the present disclosure is designed to be used as part of a line support processor also often called a frame recognition data link processor operating as part of a data comm I O subsystem. FIG. 1 shows such a data comm I O subsystem wherein a state machine processor card 600 works in coordination with various types of line adapters. A single line adapter card 700 may be used as well as Quad line adapters such as that shown in cards 400 and 500. These Quad line adapters constitute units of four addressable line adapters, and each line adapter can handle a single data communications line terminal through an electrical interface. FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a Single byte oriented line adapter system. A remote data set or data terminal may be connected to input output circuit means which includes timer 507 and USART 508. This input output circuit connects to a transceiver bus controller 503 which can route the data to a multiplexor 504 for conveyance along I O bus 10 to the state machine processor 600 or into a RAM buffer 550m Data in the state machine processor can be routed from the state machine s output control register along bus 172 into the transceiver bus controller 503 for transmission to the input output circuit means. The multiplexor 504 receives control signals from the data link interface unit 700 of FIG.1 in addition to other control signals which identify units within the line adapter system. Also provided is an automatic calling unit output register 505 which can receive signals useful for dialing remote terminals on telephone lines. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a Quad Line Adapter used for byte oriented protocol operations. The input output circuit means which connect to remote terminals is composed of four basic units such as 507, 508 timer 0 andUSART 0 . Likewise, input output service to a remote terminal is provided by timer 509 and USART 1 designated 501.Likewise, units 511, 512 constitute an operating unit for another remote terminal as do units 513 and 514 for yet another remote terminal. As discussed under FIG. 4, the Line Adapter uses a transceiver bus controller 503 and a set of multiplexors 506.It should be noted that the multiplexors such as 504 and 506 are in essence dual operating multiplexor sets in that they receive control signals from two different input output units. Corresponding to the Automatic Calling Unit OutputRegister of FIG. 4, the Quad Line Adapter of FIG. 2 uses four such ACU output registers. Also in the Quad Line Adapter there is provided an extra set of RAM buffer memories designated 550my and 55 m2. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the State MachineMicroprocessor which is used to control the single line adapter or multiple configurations of line adapters. TheState Machine Processor sometimes designated as UIO StateMachine resides on a circuit board of chips which can be inserted as a slide in card into the base module FIG. 1 where it connects to the backplane. The State Machine connects to the application dependent logic through the frontplane connectors as seen in FIG. 1. A detailed description of the elements and use of the UIO State Machine has been the subject of several prior patents which are included herein by reference. These patents. are U.S. Patent 4,293,909 entitled Digital System ForData Transfer Using Universal Input Output Microprocessor , inventors Robert D. Catiller and Brian K. Forbes. U.S. Patent 4,291,372 entitled MicroprocessorSystem With Specialized Instruction Format , inventorsBrian K. Forbes and Robert D. Catiller. U.S. Patent 4,292,667 entitled MicroprocessorSystem Facilitating Repetition of Instructions , inventorsRobert D. Cm tiller and Brian K. Forbes. The use of a host computer working in conjunction with an I O subsystem which uses peculiar commands called I o descriptors, data link descriptors, and result descriptors is shown in U.S. Patent 4,189,769, February 19, 1980, toDarwen 3. Cook and Donald A. Millers, II, and entitled Input Output Subsystem For Digital Data Processing System and this patent is also included herein by reference. FIG. S is a diagram of certain logic on the DLI LA Data Link Interface Line Adapter card 700 which is used to select or designate the RAM buffer memory of the singleLine Adapter card or a selected memory of a specific one of the four line adapter memories on the Quad line adapter card.Shown as RAM storage means 550m in FIG. 5 is the particular memory used for the single Line Adapter. However, in the multiple Line Adapter situation, each Line Adapter has a similar selection system for selecting the particular memory associated with that Line Adapter. Address lines from the State Machine Processor MADDRnn connect to a comparator 100C and also to the RAM buffer 550my A chip select signal CS is activated to the buffer memory 550m by means of logic signals from theComparator 100C and the Designate Flip Flop DESF . A unique jumper bit provides input to the Designate Flip Flop from theI O bus 10 in order to particularly identify any given selected buffer memory in the system. The particular bit line of the I O bus 10, which is to be chosen, is set by theState Machine Microprocessor. BYTE ORIENTED LINE ADAPTER A functional section of the Line Support Processor also called the Frame Recognition Data Link Processor and orLine Support Processor DLP is the Line Adapter called the Byte Oriented Line Adapter . This is sometimes also called a Character Oriented Line Adapter. The data comm Line Adapter is basically a device which interfaces on one end to a data communication line electrical interface , and on the other end interfaces to a processor which has been designated as the UIO State Machine 600 UIOSM . The primary function of the Line Adapter is to serialize bit information to from byte information, to provide timing, to generate service requests, to supply a RAM memory, to provide automatic calling interfacing and to provide connection to level changers which will match the data communication lines. The Byteoriented Line Adapter is also built in two basic configurations designated as i Quad Line Adapter and ii the Single Line Adapter.The Single Line Adapter is part of the Line Support Processor and the Single Line Adapter shares the same board with theData Link Interface DLI circuitry. The Line Adapter is required regardless of the quantity of lines controlled by the Line Support Processor. The Quad Line Adapter contains essentially four 4 Line Adapters on one board. These boards are typical 10 inch by 13 inch boards which plug into the backplane of the Base Connection Module. Also a smaller version of the Line Adapter may be configured as a Dual Line Adapter which consists of two Line Adapters on one board rather than four Line Adapters. As seen in FIG. 1 each of the Line Adapter cards 40R,500 connect both to the State Machine Processor 600 and to the DLI LA 700 Data Link Interface Single Line Adapter . As seen in FIGS. 2 and 4, connection to the data communications line is through an electrical interface El which connects to the Line Adapter. There are various types of electrical interface boards which exist and which may be mounted in different combinations on the Quad LineAdapters. Thus, depending on the electrical characteristics of the data comm line, the only change required is that of the electrical interface, while the Line Adapter remains as is. From one to eight Line Adapters may variously be addressed by the State Machine Processor 600 thus, eachLine Adapter is jumpered uniquely in order to identify its address. The Line Adapter must be designated for theState Machine Processor to communicate with it. Several addressable components are contained on a Line Adapter which the State Machine Processor may communicate with, in the form of Write Read data or Status or Control signals. The addressable components of the Byte OrientedLine Adapter are i USART 508, 510, 512, 514, FIG. 2 ii Timer 507, 509, 511, 513, FIG. 2 iii Auto Call Output iv Auto Call Status v Component Requestors vi Memory RAM The USART Universal Synchronous AsynchronousReceiver Transmitter accepts data bytes from the StateMachine Processor 600 and converts them into serial bits for transmission it also receives serial bit data and converts this to parallel data bytes. The USART device is initialized by writhing into its two internal control registers which specify the manner in which it operates. A typical USART preferred for this purpose is manufactured by Western Digital Corporation, 312A Redhill Avenue, Newport Beach, California 92663, and is designated as UCl67l and described in a Technical Manual dated August 1978 as UCl67l Asynchronous Synchronous Receiver Transmitter. Various bits of the internal control registers of this USART unit specify such things as synchronous asynchronous mode bits per character parity transparent mode Echo mode. The Timer used on the Byte Oriented Line Adapter serves two basic functions i as program timers and ii as baud rate generators for asynchronous operation. Three independent internal timers are contained in each chip, two of which are used by the software for timing purposes relative to the line operations for transmit and for receive operation. The third timer is used to generate a square wave clock which is used by the USART for asynchronous operation. Each timer is initialized independently, which indicates the mode in which it is to operate. The two program timers are capable of activating a Flag signal to the State Machine Processor 600 when a pre determined timing value has been reached. The Auto Call Output ACUOR 505 is a register which is loaded by the State Machine Processor with dial digits and control information. The output of this register drives level changer chips which convert the logic signals to EIA R5rn232 voltages. These signals drive an automatic calling unit ACU such as a Bell 801, which provides dial out capabilities. Auto Call Status is a means of providing the condition or state of input lines from the automatic calling unit ACU to the State Machine Processor 600. Lines from the ACU are received by level changer chips which convert the EIA voltages to TTL logic levels. These logic levels may be read by the State Machine Processor to determine the present status. The Component Requestors from a Line Adapter are as follows i USART ii Program Timer 1 iii ProgramTimer 2. These three components are capable of generating service requests independently of each other at unique times relative to its initialization. The service requests activate a flag signal to the State MachineProcessor which indicates that Line Adapters require servicing. After the State Machine determines which LineAdapters are requesting service, it must then determine which component on a particular Line Adapter is requesting service. Memory on the Line Adapter consists of 2,048 x 17bit words of RAM for each line. Therefore, each Quad LineAdapter card actually contains 8,192 X 17 bit words of RAM.The Single Line Adapter card FIGS. 9, 10 contains 4,n96 words of RAM 550 , one half for the data comm line and the remainder for DLI. The RAM is used by the software for transmit receive message buffering, for tables and for statements associated with the line operation.BYTE ORIENTED LINE ADAPTER OPERATIONDesignate When the State Machine Processor 600 executes code relative to an addressable component on a Line Adapter, the LA must be designated . Each Line Adapter contains a Flip Plop, whose input is jumpered to a specific bit of the i o bus. In order to designate a Line Adapter, the StateMachine Processor must execute Åa PUT OP with Strobe NO. 1 and the corresponding bit of the I O bus must be equal to 1. Executing the same OP with the I O bus bit equal to 9 will reset the Designate Flip Flop shown typically as DESK onFIG. 5.Flag Operation The various components of a Line Adapter are capable of producing service requests . These service requests are basically ORed together in order to drive a common FLAG line for all Line Adapters. A signal line,FLAG 2 , when being low active, notifies the State MachineProcessor that some Line Adapters are requesting service.The State Machine Processor can determine which Line Adapters are requesting service by executing a GET OP with the variant field V FLD 4 5 equal to 00001. The Line Adapter does not need to be designated for execution of this OP. Register address REGADRn signals in the LineAdapters are the five V FLD signals from the State MachineProcessor. Flag operation, with reference to FIG. 6, is accomplished by the FLAG t line which when low active notifies the State Machine Processor that a Line Adapter is requesting service. For example in FIG. 6, if Line Adapter 0 requests service then NOR Gate Go is activated to provide a signal low on the FLAG 2 line. Upon receiving this signal the State Machine Processor will initiate a GET OP on the GET FLAG ID line. This will send the output signal of Gate Go to a particular line ofI O bus which is dedicated to a particular one of the LineAdapters which, when read by the State Machine will identify the particular Line Adapter involved, in this case, theLine Adapter 0. Similarly each Line Adapter as 1, 2, 3, etc. will have a Gate G1, G2 or G3 to activate the FLAG 2 line and cause the State Machine to read the particular jumper connection to the line on the I O bus associated with thatLine Adapter. Data Bus Structures With the exception of the RAM FIG. 5 , memory 550my m2 all data sent to addressable components on the Line Adapter originate from the Second OutputControl Register 38 FIG. 3 in the State Machine Processor.With the exception of RAM, all data tread by the StateMachine Processor from addressable components on the LineAdapter will go to the State Machine Processor via theI O bus 10. With reference to FIG. 4 DLI LA data bus structure , the Single Line Adapter data bus structure is shown. As seen in FIG. 4, the Second Output ControlRegister 38 FIG. 3 lines OCREG 20n connect directly to the inputs of the Auto Call Unit Output Register 505 ACTOR and they also connect directly to the Transceiver BusController chip 503 which provides bidirectional bus drivers. The Auto Call Unit Output Register 505 is a six bit D type flip flop register DR6n . When the clock input is enabled, data from the Second Output Register 38 will be strobed into ACUOR 505. Data sent to both the Timer 507 and to the USART 508,FIG. 4, originate from the Second Output Register 38 in theState Machine Processor FIG. 3 and is sent through theTransceiver bus controller 503 then is sent to the addressed component. The data lines for the Timer component are HI active and for the USART component they are tO active. Being as both components share the same data bus, data to one of the components must be inverted. The Timer 507 is used to receive the inverted data, that is, 1 0 and 0 1, while the USART 508 receives the conventional format. Thus, a one bit from the Second Output Register 38 in the State Machine Processor FIG. 3 will appear as a one bit to the USART active low and as a zero bit to the Timer.The Transceiver bus controller 503, although being a three state device, is not used in its third or high impedance state. It is used for driving either DIN data in to DOUT data out or DOUT to ROUT depending on the state of the RE signal which originates from bit 4 of the First Output Control Register 37 in the State MachineProcessor. When bit 4 of Register 37 is ON, the signal RE is positive and enables the DIN to flOUT direction through the Transceiver bus controller 503. Reading of information except RAM read from Line Adapter is performed by decoded GET Ops, and the read information is available on the least significant 8 bits of the i O bus 10. The 8 1 multiplexor 504 is the source of the read information. On the Single Line Adapter FIG. 4 four of the eight inputs to MUX 504 are used by the Line Adapter and the remainder are used by the Data Link Interface DLI . The multiplexors MUX s are chip selected low level during aGET OP when the V FLD 3 2 is equal to 11 and eitherV FLD 4 1 equals 0 nLI GET or the Designate Flip Flop DESF is ON LA GET . On the Quad Line Adapter cards there are 16 multiplexors, each having an eight one ratio. There are 8 multiplexors for each pair of Line Adapters. As seen in FIG. 4, the eight input lines to MUX 504 are divided in half such that four lines connect to theDLI Data Link Interface , and four lines connect to theLine Adapter. Similarly in FIG. 2, in the Quad LineAdapter, the eight input lines of each group of eight multiplexors is divided in half, similar to the SingleLine Adapter, thereby making four groups. Any group of four input lines is selected by its Designate Flip Flopt DESF, FIG. 5 being ON. The selection of any one of four lines of any such group is performed by the two least significant bits of the V FLD of a GET OP. Data to be written into RAM memory in a LineAdapter is sent via the I O bus in 16 bits plus parity format. The data read from RAM memory in a Line Adapter is placed on the MEMOUT bus 12 with 16 bits plus parity.Component Addressing As seen in FIG. 4, the outputs of components to be read are routed to the inputs of the 8 1 multiplexor which then drive the I O bus ln. There are five components on a Line Adapter which may, be read by theState Machine Processor, these are Component Requestor ID CRID USART 508 Timer 507 Automatic Calling Unit Status ACUST Adapter Type ID ADPT.ID Although these five components on a Line Adapter may be read, the USART 508 and the Timer 507 share the same input line ROUT to the multiplexors. Selection of one of the four inputs in either group of inputs to the 8 1 multiplexors is performed by the two least significant bits of the V FLD of the GET OP.V FLD 3 4 equals llXX and selection of one of the four inputs is determined as shown in Table Y 1. TABLE Y 1 Vl x VO x O O 0 1 1 0 1 1 In FIG. 4 the Single Line Adapter multiplexor 504 allows three components on a Line Adapter to be written into not including RAM . These are Automatic CallingUnit Output Register 505 ACUOR , the USART 508 and theTimer 507. The addressing of these three components occurs in two distinct fashions decode of the V FLD of PUT Ops and the decode of bits from the First Output ControlRegister 37 in the State Machine Processor FIG. 3 . The ACUOR 505 is addressed when a one of eight decoder chip decodes the PUT Op V FLD 4 5 equal 01111 and the Strobe No. 2 is sent from the State Machine Processor.This decoding is performed only on the Single Line Adapter card and is sent to other Line Adapter cards via the frontplane connector. This decoded signal is received by a three input NOR gate not shown in each Line Adapter whose other inputs are Clock and Designate FF . The output of this gate drives the clock input of the six bitACU output register. Data from the Second Output Control Register 38 FIG. 3 will then be strobed into the ACTOR 505. Addressing a USART or Timer on a designated LineAdapter is the same as chip selecting the component. This is accomplished with bits n and 1 of the First OutputControl Register 37 in the State Machine Processor along with the Designate Flip Flop in a Line Adapter. Each Line Adapter will AND its Designate FF with bits 0 and 1 in order to provide a UCS tUSART Chip Select or a TCS Timer Chip Select for its USART or Timer. The use of bits 0 and 1 in the First Output ControlRegister 37 is as follows TABLE Y 2 Register Bit and Value Signal Designation Bit 0 1 USARTCS USART Chip Select UCS Bit 1 1 TMRCS Timer Chip Select TCS The remaining bits of Register 37 are used for control signals, primarily for the USART and Timer. Random Access Memory 550m, FIG. 5 Each data comm line has 2,048 words of RAM available for its use. A word is equal to 16 data bits plus one parity bit. In FIG. 5 the RAM chip 550m is a 4,096 X 1 bit static RAM with a m Read Access time of 180 nanoseconds and is arranged with 17 chips making 4,096 words. On the flLI LA card 2,048 words are for the Single Line Adapter and 2,048 words are for the Data Link Interface. The Quad Line Adapter card provides 34 memory chips or 8,192 words of which 2,048 words are available for each line. The data comm Line Adapter memory for any line is pointed at by the memory address lines, MADDR 15 5 equal 01110. This can be seen in FIG. 5 which shows theData Link Inter face Line Adapter RAM. A five bit Comparator 100 on the DLI LA card compares for an equal c condition for i DLI memory selection or for a greater than condition MADDRnn 01110 provides for ii Line AdapterRAM selection. The signal LARAMSEL Line Adapter RAMSelect will go to all Line Adapter cards via the frontplane cable to select the designated Line AdapterRAM memory. If memory address lines MADDR 15 5 equals Ollix DLI or LA Select then a slow memory flip flop SLMF 100 f will be set equal to 1.The Flip Flop 100of output drives an open collector NAND gate whose output connects to the WAIT frontplane signal line to the State MachineProcessor. This signal WAIT , when low, will force theState Machine Processor to wait until the signal goes high . Using a RAM chip whose Read Access time is 180 nanoseconds requires the State Machine Processor to wait for one clock time, thereby when the DLI memory 550m, FIG. 5 or any Line Adapter memory is selected, the SLMF slow memory flip flop will be on for one clock and then toggle off. Selection of the RAM memory 550 on the DLI LA m card is done via MADflR 15 5 equal to 01110 or else MANOR 15 5 equal 01111 and the Designate Flip Flop beingON. This logic controls the chip select input on the RAM chips. The division of RAM for DLI or for Line Adapter memory is handled by controlling the A FIG. 5 address pin on the RAM 550 chip. if MADDR 15 5 is equal m to 01111 and the Line Adapter Designate Flip Flop DESF isON, the RAM is chip selected and the A ll address input isTRUE. The Quad Line Adapter card FIG. 2 contains two groups of memory chips 550 1 550 2 wherein Data Comm D.C. lines 0 and 1 on the card share the same group ofRAM chips and Data Comm lines 2 and 3 share the other group of RAM chips. The signal LARAMSEL Line Adapter RAM Select,FIG. 5 goes to all Line Adapters and is then essentiallyANDED with appropriate Designate conditions to allow the desired RAM group to be chip selected.A division of RAM for the first or second data comm line on a Quad LineAdapter is handled by controlling the A ll address pin FIG. 5 on the RAM chip signal DESn where n 1 and for the third and fourth line the A ll pin on the second group of RAM chips is controlled by DESn FIG. 5 where n 3. A Dual Line Adapter will only contain one group of memory chips 17 and will operate the same as line 0 and line 1 on the Quad Line Adapter. Data to be written into RAM must be placed on the i o bus 10 by the StateMachine Processor and read data will be sent to the StateMachine Processor on the MEMOUTnn bus 12 nn equals OO 316 . Clear There are two methods of clearing used to clear the Line Adapters these are Power Up Clear and Designate Clear. The Power Up Clear is a signal which occurs during the power up sequence for the cabinet housing the LineAdapters. The signal comes from the backplane of the BaseModule cabinet and is active Low. The Designate Clear is a function controlled by theState Machine Processor, and only the Line Adapters which are designated are the ones that get cleared. The Clear signal originates from bit 7 of the First Output ControlRegister 37 of the State Machine Processor FIG. 3 . The Power up Clear operates to clear three components on theLine Adapter. These are the nesignate Flip Flop the AutoCall Output Register and the USART. The Designate Clear signal clears two components on the Line Adapter. These are Auto Call Unit OutputRegister ACUOR and the USART.USART Organization and Operation The USART is a MOS LSI device housed in a 40 pin Dual in line package and is TTL compatible on all inputs and outputs. The USART performs the functions of interfacing a serial data communications channel to a parallel digital system and is capable of full duplex communications with synchronous or asynchronous systems. One preferred embodiment of the USART is that manufactured by Western Digital Corporation, 3128 Red hillAvenue, Newport Beach, California 92663 and is designated asModel Us1671 Asynchronous SynchrOnous Receiver Transmitter and described in their Technical Data Publication ofAugust 1978 which includes a block diagram showing the various registers, controls and components which are briefly described herein below. i Receiver Register RR this is an eight bit shift register which inputs the received data at a clock rate determined by an internal control register. The incoming data is assembled to the selected character in length and then transferred to the Receiver Holding Register with logic zeroes filling out any unused high order bit positions. At this time the INTR Interrupt output is made active for informing the State Machine of the LSP that the Receiver Holding Register contains valid data. ii Receiver Holding Register RHR this is an 8 bit parallel buffer register which presents assembled receiver characters to the DAL Data Access Line bus lines FIG. 2 when requested through a Read operation. iii Comparator the 8 bit comparator is used in the Synchronous Mode to compare the assembled contents of the Receiver Register and the SYN register or the DLE register. A match between the registers sets up the stripping of the received character when programmed by preventing the data from being loaded into the Receiver Holding Register. A bit in an internal Status Register is set when stripping is performed. The comparator output also enables character synchronization of the Receiver on two successive matches with the SYN register. iv SYN Register this is an 8 bit register which is loaded from the DAL Data Access Line lines FIG. 2 by a Write operation and it holds the synchronization code used to establish receiver character synchronization. It serves as a fill character when no new data is available in the Transmitter Holding Register during transmission. This register cannot be read onto the DAL lines. it must be loaded with logic zeroes in all unused high order bits. v DLE Register this is an eight bit register which is loaded from the DAL lines by a Write operation and holds the IDLE nelimiter character used in the Transparent Mode of operation, in which an idle transmit period is filled with the combination DLE SYN pair of characters rather than a single SYN character. In addition, the USART may be programmed to force a single DLE character prior to any data character transmission while in the transmitter transparent mode . vi Transmitter Holding Register THR this is an eight bit parallel buffer register which holds parallel transmitted data transferred from the DAt lines by a Write operation. This data is transferred to the Transmitter Register TR when the transmitter section is enabled and the Transmitter Register is ready to send new data. During this transfer, the signal interrupt INTR is made active for informing the Line Support Processor that the Transmitter Holding Register is empty. vii Transmitter Register this is an eight bit shift register which is loaded from the THR Transmitter Holding Register , the SYN register, or the DLE register. The purpose of this register is to serialize data and present it to the transmitted Data Output lines. viii Control Register there are two eight bit control registers in the USART which hold device programming signals such as mode selection, clock selection, interface signal control, and data format. Each of the control registers can be loaded from the data access lines DAL by a Write operation, or else read into the DAL lines by a Read operation.Operation of USART of Byte Oriented Line Adapter ASYNCHRONOUS MODE The framing of asynchronous characters is provided by a Start Bit logic low at the beginning of a character, and by one or more Stop Bits logic high at the end of a character. Reception of a character is initiated on recognition of the first Start Bit by a positive transition of the receiver clock, right after a proceeding Stop Bit. The Start and Stop bits are stripped off while assembling the serial bit input into a parallel character. The character assembly is completed by the reception of the Stop Bit after the reception of the last character bit. If this bit is a logic high , the character is determined to have correct framing and the USART is prepared to receive the next character. if the Stop Bit is logic low , the Framing Error Status flag is set and theReceiver assumes this bit to be the Start Bit of the next character. Character assembly continues from this point if the input is still a logic low when sampled at the theoretical center of the assumed Start Bit. As long as theReceiver input is spacing i.e. receiving a space rather than a Mark , then all zero characters are assembled, and error flags and data received interrupts are generated so that line breaks can be determined.After a character of all zeroes is assembled along with a zero in the Stop Bit location, the first received logic high is determined as a Stop Bit and this resets the receiver circuit to a Ready state for assembly of the next character. In the Asynchronous Mode the character transmission occurs when information contained in the THR TransmitterHolding Register is transferred to the TR TransmitterRegister Transmission is initiated by the insertion of aStart Bit, followed by the serial output of the character least significant bit first with parity, if enabled, following the most significant bit then there is the insertion of the 1 , 1.5 , or 2 bit length Stop condition.if the THR Transmitter Holding Register is full, the next character transmission starts after the transmission of the Stop Bit of the present character in the TR transmitter register . Otherwise, the Mark logic high condition is continually transmitted until the THR Transmitter Holding Register is loaded. SYNCHRONOUS MODE The synchronization of messages is carried out by a special Synchronization Character Code SYN transmitted at the beginning of a block of characters.The Receiver, when enabled, searches for two contiguous characters matching the bit pattern contained in the SYN register. During the time that the Receiver is searching, data is not transferred to the THR Transmitter HoldingRegister and status bits are not updated and the Receiver interrupt is not activated. After the detection of the first SYN character, the Receiver assembles subsequent bits into characters whose length is determined by the contents of the USART internal control register. If, after the firstSYN character detection a second SYN character is present, the Receiver enters the Synchronization Mode until theReceiver Enable Bit is turned off . if a second successiveSYN character is not found, then the Receiver reverts back to the Search Mode. In the Synchronous Mode, a continuous stream of characters are transmitted once the Transmitter is enabled.if the THR Transmitter Holding Register is not loaded at the time the Transmitter Register has completed the transmission of a character, this idle time will be filled by a transmission of a character contained in the SYN register in the Non Transparent Mode, or filled by the characters contained in the DLE and the SYN registers respectively while in the Transparent Mode of operation .RECEIVER OPERATION The Receiver data input is clocked into the Receiver Register by a lX Receiver clock from a modem Data Set, or by a local 32X bit rate clock asynchronous selected from one of four input pins. When using the lX Receiver Clock, the Receiver data is sampled on the positive transition of the clock in the SynchronousModes. When using a 32X clock in the Asynchronous Mode, the Receive Sampling Clock is phased to the Mark To Space transition of the Received Data Start Bit and defines through clock counts the center of each received DataBit at the positive transition 16 clock periods later.When the complete character has been shifted into theReceiver Register, it is transferred to the RHR ReceiverHolding Register the unused, higher number bits are filled with zeros. At this time the Receiver Status bits Framing Error Sync Detect, Parity Error DLE Detect,Overrun Error, and Data Received are updated in theStatus Register and the Data Received interrupt is activated. Parity Error is set if encountered while theReceiver Parity Check is enabled in the internal control register. Overrun Error is set if the Data ReceivedStatus Bit is not cleared through a Read Operation by an external device when a new character is ready to be transferred to the RHR Received Holding Register . This error flag indicates that a character has been lost, that is new data is lost, and the old data and its status flags are saved. The characters assembled in the Receiver Register that match the contents of the SYN or the DLE register are not loaded into the RHR Receiver Holding Register , and the DR Data Received interrupt is not generated if bit 3 of USART control register 2 CR23 SYN Strip or Bit 4 ofUSART control register 1 CR14 DLE Strip are set respectively, The SYN DET and the DLE DET status bits are set with the next non SyN or DLE character. When both control register bits CR23 and CR14 are set TransparentMode , the DLE SYN combination is stripped. The SYN comparison occurs only with the character received after the DLE character. if two successive DLE characters are received, only the first DLE character is stripped. No parity check is made in this mode.TRANSMITTER OPERATIONS Information is transferred to theTHR Transmitter Holding Register by a Write operation.Information can be loaded into this THR at any time, even when the Transmitter is not enabled. Transmission of data is initiated only when the Request to Send Bit is set to a logic one in the USART control register and the Clear to Send input is at a logic low . Information is normally transferred from a THR to the Transmitter Register when the latter has completed transmission of a character. However, information in the DLE register may be transferred prior to the information contained in the THR if the Force DLE signal condition is enabled CR15 Force, DLE and CR16 TXTransparent and set to a logic one . The control bit CR15 must be set prior to loading of a new character in theTHR to insure forcing the DLE character prior to transmission of the data character.The Transmitter Register output passes through a Flip Flop which delays the output by one clock period. When using the 1X clock generated by the modem Data Set, the output data changes state on the negative clock transition and the delay is one bit period. When the Transmitter is enabled, a Transmitter interrupt is generated each time the THR is empty. If theTHR is empty when the Transmitter Register is ready for a new character, the Transmitter enters an idle state.During this idle time, a logic high will be presented to the Transmitted Data Output in the Asynchronous Mode or the contents of the SYN register will be presented in theSynchronous Non Transparent Mode CR16 0 . In theSynchronous Transmit Transparent Mode enabled by bit 6 ofUSART control register 1 Logic 1 , the idle state will be filled by a DLE SYN character transmission in that order.When entering the Transparent Mode, the DLE SYN fill in will not occur until the first forced DLE. if the Transmitter section is disabled by a reset of the Request to Send signal RTS , any partially transmitted character is completed before the Transmitter section of the USART is disabled. As soon as the CTS signal Clear to Send goes high, the transmitted data output will go high. When the Transmit Parity is enabled, the selectedOdd or Even parity bit is inserted into the last bit of the character in place of the last bit of the TransmitterRegister. This limits transfer of character information to a maximum of 7 bits plus parity or 8 bits without parity. Parity cannot be enabled in the Synchronous TransparencyMode.INPUT OUTPUT OPERATION OF USART All Data, Control andStatus words are transferred over the Data Access Lines DALO 7 as seen in FIG. 2, DAL. Additional input lines provide controls for addressing a particular unit and regulating all input and output operations. Other lines provide interrupt capability to indicate to a controller that an input operation is requested by the USART.All input output terminology is referenced to the Bus ControllerTransceiver 503, FIG. 2, so that a Read or Input takes data from the USART and places it on the DAL lines to theTransceiver 503, while a Write or an Output places data from the Transceiver 503 onto the DAL lines and into the TABLE Y 4 Bits 2 0 Selected Register of USART 000 Control Register 1 010 Control Register 2 100 SYN and DLE Register 110 Transmitter Holding Register When the Write Enable WE line is set to a logic low condition by the State Machine, the USART gates the data from Transceiver 503 onto the DAL bus and into the addressed register. If data is written into the TransmitterHolding Register THR , the THRE THR empty Status Bit is cleared to a logic zero. The 100 address loads both the SYN and PLE registers. After writing into the SYN register, the device is conditioned to write into the DLE register if followed by another Write pulse which has the 100 address. Any intervening Read or Write operation with another address resets this condition such that the next 100 will address the SYN register. iii INTERRUPTS The following conditions will generate interrupts 1. Data Received DR indicates transfer of a new character to the Receiver Holding Register RHR while the Receiver is enabled. 2. Transmitter Holding Register Empty THRE indicates that the THR register is empty while the Transmitter is enabled. The first interrupt occurs when the Transmitter becomes enabled if there is an empty THR, or after the character is transferred to the Transmitter Register, thus making the THR empty. USART. The following input output terminology discussed below is referenced to the Bus Controller Transceiver 503. i READ A Read operation is initiated by the placement of an 8 bit address from State Machine 600 on theDAL FIG. 5 by the Bus Controller 503, FIG. 2. When theChip Select signal goes to a logic low state, the USART as 5n8 compares bits 7 3 of the DAL with its hard wiredIn code on Pins 17, 22, 24, 25, 26 and becomes selected on a Match condition. Bits 2 0 of the address are used to select the USART registers to read from as follows TABLE Y 3 Bits 2 0 Selected Register of USART 000 Control Register 1 010 Control Register 2 100 Status Register 110 Receiver Holding Register When the Read Enable RE line is set to a logic low condition by the State Machine 600, the USART gates the contents of the address register onto the DAL bus.The Read operation terminates, and the devices become unselected, and both the Chip Select and Read Enable return to the logic high condition. Reading of the Receiver Holding Register clears the DR status bit. Bit zero must be a logic low in Read or in Write operations. ii WRITE A Write operation is initiated by making a Chip Select input go to the logic low state.Bits 2 0 of the address are used to select USART registers which are written into as follows 3. Carrier On this indicates the Carrier Detector input has gone low when DTR is on . DTR Data Terminal Ready . 4. Carrier Off indicates that the Carrier ,Detector input has gone high when DTR is on 5. DSR On indicates the Data Set Ready input has gone low when DTR is on 6. DSR Off indicates the Data Set Ready input has gone high when DTR is on 7. Ring On indicates the Ring Indicator input has gone low when DTR is off. Each time an Interrupt Condition exists, the INTER output from the USART is made a logic low . The StateMachine then acknowledges the Interrupt Request by setting the CS Chip Select and Interrupt Acknowledge Input lACK to the USART to a low state, otherwise the InterruptCondition INTR would never get reset.Auto Call Operation For Operations Using an 801 Auto Call Unit The 801 ACU has a 4 bit interface for receiving digits of the call number to be dialed. This interface is defined by the EIA Standard RS 366 and involves the following signals TABLE Y 5 Call Request CRQ Data Line Occupied DLO Present Next Digit PND Digit Present DPR Data Set Status DSS Abandon Call and Retry ACR NB 8 Digit NB 4 Digit NB 2 Digit NB 1 Digit The dialing sequence operates as follows The Line Adapter turns CRQ on provided that theDLO is off . After detection of the dial tone, which is done by the 801, the digits are transferred one at a time to the 801. The 801 converts the digits to signals which duplicate the function of a rotating dial pulse or a touch tone frequency compatible signal.These signals are transmitted to the phone line. At call completion, DSS comes on to signify receipt of answer tone from the calledData Set. Receipt of DSS allows the line to be transferred to the ACU associated data set. If DSS fails to come on the Abandon Call and Retry ACR timer begins timing out. With pulse dialing, a typical 10 digit number takes 15 seconds to dial for touch tone dialing the same number requires approximately one second. The answer sequence begins sometime after the last digit has been sent by the 801.Interface Operation Data Comm Line Adapter S tate Machine The UIO Data Communication Line Adapter is an application dependent device which is controlled by the UlO State Machine Processor 600. The basic types of Line Adapters are available these are the Character Oriented Line Adapter and the Bit Oriented Line Adapter, each of which may have a variety of electrical interfaces to the data communication lines. One to eight Line Adapters may be serviced by oneState Machine Processor on an individual basis. Each LineAdapter contains components which are addressable and are serviced by the State Machine Processor with PUT or GET instructions. The components on the Line Adapter are serviced with one or a series of instructions which, in some cases, provide sequential control of the component. The communication between the State Machine Processor and the Line Adapter can be separated into two basic groups i Undesignated ii Designated The Undesignated operations do not require theLine Adapter to be designated to execute those instructions, Designated type operations require the Line Adapter to be designated or identified to execute those instructions or series of instructions. The following operations except for ACUOR in addition to requiring the Line Adapter to be Designated will use the First Control Register 37 in the State MachineProcessor 600 for control purposes to components on a LineAdapter. With the exception of the Clear OP, all other operations will be a series of PUT GET OPs to provide the necessary sequential control. Data outputted to the Line Adapter for these operations will originate from the Second Output ControlRegister 38 of the State Machine in FIG. 3. The bits of the First Output Control Register 37 of the State Machine FIG. 6 are organized for control functions as follows TABLE Y 6 Bit Signal 0 UCS USART Chip Select This bit must be a 1 when the USART requires a chip select. 1 TCS Timer Chip Select This bit must be a 1 when the Program Timer Baud Rate Generator requires a chip select. 2 IACKI Interrupt Acknowledge in This bit must be a On to acknowledge an interrupt from a designated and chip selected USART. 3 WE Write Enable This bit must be 0 to enable writing to the USART or Timer. 4 RE Read Enable This bit must be 0 to enable reading from the USART or Timer. 5,6 A0,A1 Address Bit o or 1 These two bits select a register within the Timer. 7 CLR Clear This bit must be 1 to provide a clear to the Line Adapter.USART Interfacing Three procedures are used when communicating with a tJSART on a Line Adapter these are i Interrupt Acknowledge Procedure ii Read Procedure iii Write ProcedureTimer Baud Rate Generator Interfacing Two basic procedures are used when communicating with the timer components these are i Write Procedure and ii Read Procedure. Five control signals originating from unique bits of the First Output Control Register 37 are used for theTimer. These are TCS Timer Chip Select AO, Al Register Addressing Lines WE Write Enable RE Read EnableBaud Rate Generator The character oriented UIO DataComm Line Adapters will use a USART which requires an input clock that is 32 times faster than the bit time of theAsynchronous line it is communicating with. To obtain thisX32 clock it is preferred to use an lintel 8253 programmable timer chip, whose squarewave output is connected to theUSART. This timer is driven by a crystal controlled clock whose frequency is 1.2288 megahertz. After initializing theTimer, a divisor value must be loaded which will produce the necessary X32 clock.
