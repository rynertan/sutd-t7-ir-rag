## Description
SELF DRILLING AND SELF EXTRUDING SCREW FASTENER This application is a Continuation In Part of my earlier filed application entitled SELF DRILLING AND SELF EXTRUDINGSCREW, Serial Number 443,339, filed November 22, 1982. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to Driven, evaded, andScrew Threaded Fastenings, and more particularly to screws with roll formed threads. Still more specifically, the screws herein are of the self threading type capable of partially drilling and penetrating a workpiece to form their own opening and thereafter enlarging and threading that opening to make a firm engagement therewith. The types of screws described herein may be useful in the field of dry wall construction, but even more useful in joining together two sheets of metal or other material.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART There are currently available on the market multi threaded screws of the self extruding type, which are reasonably satisfactory in joining together sheets of relatively thin gauge metal e.g. 20 gauge . Such screws have been found to be deficient or to break down when used with heavier gauge metal such as 18 or 16 gauge. The problems associated withzsuch screws and with the penetration of heavier gauge workpieces generally were addressed in my earlier patent no. 4,027,573 Screw fasteners capable of penetratir.g and astgir heavy gauge metal are also commercially available and are cxen.plifed by the screw shown in the patent to Skierski, no. 3,517,542. Such screw is in fact a composite construction of a drill bit formed with screw threads on its shank portion. This fastener completely drills an opening in a workpiece and relies on the screw threads for fastening. Screws of this type cannot be formed completely by roll forming, are relatively slow to install, and are much more expensive than the screw fastener of the present invention. Roll formed, self extruding fasteners purported to be capable of penetrating and fastening thin gauge metal are exemplified by the screws shown in the patents to Shimizu no. 4,241,638 and no. 4,329,099, and in the patent to Okada no. 4,323,326.The screws illustrated and described in the patents to Shimizu have two threads which extend from the shank part way down the tapered point. Shimizu also has a third thread in a position midway between the two screw threads, which begins at the pointed tip in a very steep lead angle which purportedly functions as a drilling portion. This third thread ends where the shank begins and the tapering portion ends. The juncture between the shank and tapered point is where greatest resistance is encountered in penetrating a workpiece. This third thread effectively causes binding as it approaches near the shank and inhibits rather than enhances such penetration. In one modification of the Shimizu screw, two threads are shown on the tapered point, one of which fades away on the tapered point near the juncture of the shank.A third thread begins near this region but does not follow in the groove made by fading thread. The fact that it does not follow in same groove causes binding at this location. The patent to Okada shows a self drilling screw formed with one or more threads with at least one cutting edge of a drill shape at the tip end. In practice, it is very difficult to fill out the threads at the tip of the point by roll forming. In addition, the tip is the most narrow and thus the weakest part of the screw. If the threads are too high at the tip, these threads are put under too much stress in use, and the tip will break or the threads will wear out. SUNMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present ilivention to provide an improved screw fastener construction, formed completely by a roll forming process, and adapted to be self 4rilling and selftapping in heavy gauge sheet metals, e.g, sheet steel of 18 gauge and heavier. The screw fastener has one thread which extends uninterruptedly from the pointed tip in a helical path over the outer surface of the tapered point. This thread may extend continuously over the juncture of the tapered portion and the shank, or it may diminish in height relative to the tapered point so as to relieve resistance to penetration into a workpiece at this juncture, as described in my earlier patent no. 4,027,573.The second thread lies within and is parallel with said first thread and has a leading edge which commences at a location axially rearward from the tip. This second thread is characterize by a leading edge having a more abrupt rise and preferably greater height than said first thread. This leading edge serves as a cutting edge for drilling and enlarging the hole being formed in a workpiece. This thread may also diminish in height with respect to the tapered point, or increase in height at a decreasing rate as it approaches the juncture with the shank It is a more specific object to provide a screw construction of the type described in which the axial location of the starting point for the leading edge of the second thread may be yaried slightly for specific types of metals to be joined.In other words, the screws may be specifically designed according to the principles of this invention for particular applications. Other features and advantages of tke invention will. be apparent from the following description and 6aim and are illustrated in the accompanying drawings which show structure embodying preferred features of the present invention and the principles thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The improved screw fastener of the present iflvaflti9n,is shown in fragmentary form in FIGS. 1 and 2 and is designated generally by the number 10. The screw 10 comprises an elongated cylindrical shank portion 11, a tapered or generally conical point portion 12, a first raised screw thread 13, a second raised screw thread 14, and an integral head 15. The head 15 may be any desired conventional form, such as the slotted hex head shown, or other head adapted to receive a rotary driving tool. The first thread 13 may be regarded as a conventional tapping or self extruding screw thread in most of the embodiments shown and described herein. The second thread 14 is identified as a drilling thread and differs substantially from conventional threads. Roll form screws generally are formed from soft steel wire that is cut to a desired length, the head is formed by compression of one end of the wire blank in a forming die, and the desired threads and point roll formed on the exterior of the blank. The completely formed screw is then heat treated to a suitable hardness, and then coated or plated as desired. The roll forming dies are generally in the shape of flat parallel plates having opposing faces onto which parallel angular grooves have been cut to define the desired thread pitch, spacing, and height. The depth of the groove cut defines the height of the thread on the finished screw. The forming dies are generally parallel except for raised portions which merge closely together to form the tapered point. The dies move parallel to each other in the forming process with a screw blank rolled between the opposing faces. The groove defining the thread angle conventionally has an included angle of perhaps 60 degrees. The groove defining the drilling thread 14 of the present invention may have a different included angle. Referring now to FIG. 2, the principles of the invention are illustrated in greater detail. The fitst chzead 13, or tapping thread, has a leading edge 16 which commences at a location immediately adjacent the tip 17 of the conical point 12. The thread 13 extends in a helical path around the outer surface of the point 12 and onto the shank 11. The drilling thread 14 has a leading or cutting edge 20 commencing at a location 21 which is axially rearward from the tip 17, or to the left as shown. The leading edge 20 is characterized by a more abrupt rise than the leading edge 16 of the thread 13. This abrupt rise, or angle of elevation of the thread 14, is obtained from the configuration of the forming dies. Normally, a grinding wheel having a diameter of approximately 2 3 4 is used to cut the groove defining the thread formation.To obtain the more abrupt rise, a grinding wheel of much smaller diameter, e.g. about 111, is utilized to initiate the cutting of the groove at the desired location. The consequent abrupt rise of the leading edge 20 enables the thread 14 to attain full height much faster and causes the leading edge 20 to contact a workpiece at a better angle for cutting. The abrupt rise in thread height may also be produced by modifying the grooves in the dies by means of an EDM process or by other means. The drilling thread 14 may rise to a height equal to or preferably greater than the height of thread 13 at the same axial position. The height of thread 14 may also diminish with respect to the corresponding height of thread 13 thereafter as it approaches the juncture of the point 12 with the shank 11. This design feature should reduce resistance to penetration into a workpiece, as described in my earlier patent no. 4,027,573. Referring now to FIG. 3, there is illustrated a modification to the construction of FIG. 2, wherein one or both of the threads 13 and 14 diminish in height with respect to the surface of the point 12 as these threads approach the juncture between the point 12 and shank 11, and only one thread 18 extends in a helical path along the outer surface of the shank 11. This thread 18 may have different pitch or thread spacing on the shank 11, from either of the threads 13 and 14 . Referring now to FIG. 4, there is illustrated in schematic form the envelope of revolution of the screw 10 of FIG. 2.This figure shows the envelope 23 for the thread 13 in dotted line, and the envelope 24 for the thread 14 in solid line.This figure also shows the height of the thread 14 as rising above that of the thread 13. It should be understood, however, that the thread height of 14 need rise only to equal the height of thread 13, as shown in FIG. 6. The actual desired height of the thread 14 may be a design parameter to be determines by the intended use for the particular screw, i.e. for the types of sheet material to be penetrated or joined together. Referring to FIG. 5, there is illustrated the envelope of revolution for the screw configuration shown inFIG. 3. This figure shows that both threads 13 and 14 diminish in height relative to the tapered point 12 and may fade away completely on the shank 11. There may be a slight overlap of the termination of threads 13 and 14 nnd the commencement of thread 18. This thread 18 may originate on the tapered point portion and extend onto the shank as a single thread of different pitch than the threads 13 and 14 . For example, the threads 13 and 14 may have a pitch of 7 15 threads per inch, double lead, and the thread 18 may have a pitch of 7 18 threads per inch, single lead on the shank 11.If the thread 13 is maintained with the same helix angle and height onto the shank 11, only thread 14 need diminish in height near the juncture. Since thread 14 commences and ends on the tapered point, this thread may also have a different pitch than thread 13 for certain applications. Since thread 14 is slightly higher than thread 13 , this thread can in effect act as a reamer to enlarge the opening for thread 13 , regardless of the actual pitch of thread 14 . In the modification shown in FIG. 7, the tapping thread 13 is shown as being formed with an abrupt rise 33 which can serve as an additional cutting edge for a portion of the distance that may be required in penetrating a workpiece. Tn n this embodi ment, both threads drill together for some desired interval to augment penetration. This design is particularly useful in joining together two sheets of material, because the abrupt rise on both threads force the two sheets 40 and 41 closely together during penetration. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8, the tapping thread 53 is shown as commencing at the tip of the point, and the cutting thread 54 commencing at a location only slightly removed from the tip. The cutting thread 54 rises in height above the thread 53 and then diminishes in height below the thread 53 as both threads advance up the tapered point and onto the shank. This diminished height provides some relief to penetrating into a workpiece but still retains thread engagement during entry In all of the embodiments shown and described above, the operational performance is common in that all provide what may be described as a three stage entry into a workpiece. In the first stage, the screw 10 penetrates in a conventional manner to a depth defined from the tip 17 to the leading ede1 2 thread 14. At this depth, the diameter of the opening being formed has increased significantly, and the resistance to further penetration has increased correspondingly. At this second stage, the leading edge 22 of thread 14 begins ts serve as a drill or cutting edge for further enloarging and opening.After the cutting edge 22 has enlarged the opening, the screw 10 can advance into the third stage in a conventional manner, or with relief to further penetration by diminishing the relative height of one or both of the threads with respect to the surface of the point 12. In other words, the drill thread 14 enlarges the opening in the workpiece to the point where the screw becomes stronger than the workpiece. The threads 13 and or 14 then engage the workpiece to pull up. This can be performed rapidly and ensure 100 thread engagement. It has been found that screw fasteners constructed according to the principles of this invention are capable of penetrating and fastening 18 and 16 gauge steel with more than 90 reliability, and 14 gauge steel with more than 50 reliability.In addition, this screw can do so in a shorter time span than the composite drill screws. No screw other than this one that has its threads made completely by a roll forming process is known to perform with such capability. The invention is not to be considered as limited to the embodiments shown and described, except insofar as the claims may be so limited.
