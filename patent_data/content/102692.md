# Non aqueous electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a nonaqueous cell employing a FeS₂ containing or MnO₂ containing cathode and an organic electrolyte having a lithium halide, such as LiCl, added to the cell to improve the voltage level on pulse discharge of the cell particularly at low temperatures and or to stabilize the open circuit voltage.
