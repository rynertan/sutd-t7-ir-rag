# Stable sulpho adenosyl l methionine same salts, particularly suitable for parenteral use.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to new stable sulpho ad enosyl L methionine SAMe salts particularly suitable for parenteral use, their production process, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active principles. Said salts correspond to the general formula SAMe.n CHâ‚‚ The process for producing said salts consists of the fol lowing stages a enriching the starting yeast with SAMe b lysing the cells and recovering a solution rich in SAMe cell lysate c prepurifying the cell lysate by ultrafiltration d passing the prepurified lysate through a column of weak acid ion exchange resin and eluting with the required disulphonic acid e passing the eluate of said column through a column of absorption resin and washing with the required disul phonic acid f concentrating the eluate of the latter column by reverse osmosis g drying the concentrated solution.
