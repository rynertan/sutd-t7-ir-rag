# TALL OIL FATTY ACIDS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

## Abstract
Distilled tall oil fatty acids are improved by irradiation which isomerizes trans dimethoxystilbene trans DMS im purity to cis dimethoxystilbene which is easily removed by fractional distillation. Thus, the trans DMS is removed without loss of fatty acid components from the distilled tall oil fatty acid.
