# High temperature solid electrolyte electrochemical cells.

## Abstract
A high temperature, solid electrolyte electro chemical cell, subject to thermal cycling temperatures of between about 25 C and about 1200 C, capable of electronic intercon nection to at least one other electrochemical cell and capable of operating in an environment containing oxygen and a fuel, is made where the cell has a first and second electrode with solid electrolyte between them, where an improved intercon nect material is applied along a portion of a supporting electrode where the interconnect is made of a chemically modified lanthanum chromite, containing cobalt as the important additive, which interconnect allows for adjustment of the thermal expansion of the interconnect material to more nearly match that of other cell components, such as zirconia electrolyte, and is stable in oxygen containing atmospheres such as air and in fuel environments.
