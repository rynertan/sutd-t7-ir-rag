# Bicyclic amide acetal polyol polyisocyanate polymers.

## Abstract
A process is described for preparing novel polyurethane polymers which have good impact resistance and other desirable physical properties, said process comprising inter polymerizing a mixture of a bicyclic amide acetal, a polyol and a polyisocyanate.
