# VARIABLE CHARACTERISTIC TRANSVERSE SUSPENSION FOR RAILWAY VEHICLES

## Abstract
A railway vehicle has a body 10 , bogies 20 articulated to the body 10 and vertical and transverse suspension means between the bogies 20 and the body, the transverse suspension means including pneumatic or hydro pneumatic springs 24 located substantially horizontally and reacting between the body and the opposite sides of each bogie. The fluid pressure supply to the springs 24 and hence the forces exerted thereby are adjusted automatically so as to contain transverse movements of the body 10 relative to the bogies 20 within predetermined limits while maintaining the flexibility of the connection practically invariant.
