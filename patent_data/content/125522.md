# Color photographic materials.

## Abstract
A color photographic material containing, as a color stain preventing agent, a substantially colorless phenol and or naphthol derivative having a group which is not released by displacement of the oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine color developing agent at the 4 position thereof and at least one sulfonamido group and at least one sulfonamido group, acylamino group or sulfonyl group at other positions of the ring. The color stain preventing agent very effectively removes the oxidation product of a color developing agent at color development and maintain the effect for a long period of time.
