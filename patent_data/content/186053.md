# Torque detecting apparatus for electrical power steering system.

## Abstract
A torque detecting apparatus for an electrical power steering system, having a steering wheel 2 , a first steering shaft 1 connected to the steering wheel 2 , a second steering shaft 3 connected to a vehicle wheel 9 to be steered, an electric motor 12 connected to the second steering shaft 3 , and a controller 14 for operating the motor 12 to produce a driving force corresponding to a torque detected by the torque detecting apparatus. The apparatus comprises an elastic coupling 4 104 128 having an elastic member 4a 126 , and coupling the steering shafts 1,3 while permitting relative rotation of the steering shafts 1, 3 through elastic deformation of the elastic member 4a 126 a first and a second detector shaft 116, 120 supported rotatably relative to each other a first and a second speed up device 15, 19 17, 21 for increasing angular velocities of rotary movements of the first and the second steering shafts 1, 3 and transmitting the rotary movements to the first and second detector shafts 16, 20 , respectively and a detector 24, 25, 26, 28 34 42 16, 31, 32, 28 34 42 associated with the detector shafts 16, 20 to detect an angle of relative rotation of the detector shafts 16, 20 and thereby detect the steering torque, and producing an electric signal representative of the torque, said signal being applied to the controller 14 .
