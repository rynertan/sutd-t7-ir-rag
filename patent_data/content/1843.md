# Acrylate ester copolymer elastomers.

## Abstract
Acrylic ester elastomers are prepared by polymerizing together a major amount of an acrylic ester monomer and a minor amount of 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate monomer optionally with another vinylidene monomer. When admixed with vulcanizing agents, the elastomers exhibit improved scorch resistance even during extended processing, and when vulcanized, provide improved oil resistance and low temperature properties.

## Description
ACRYLATE ESTER COPOLYMER ELASTOMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyacrylic ester elastomers having a reactive halide cure site are known. Such polymers are vulcanized through the halide cure site using various polyamines and sulfur fatty acid soap systems. Although these vulcanizates are useful, the elastomer curative combinations often undergo premature cure, or scorch, during processing and forming operations. This causes the elastomer to stiffen or toughen, making it difficult to process and resulting in incomplete mold filling, vulcanizates having poor appearance and poor physical properties, and generally in waste of elastomer, curatives, and other compounding ingredients. Lower temperatures may be employed to increase processing safety but this results in increased handling time per article and decreased output.A more favorable solution would be to obtain increase processing safety without increasing processing or cure times. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Elastomeric acrylate ester polymers, comprised of at least 50 percent by weight of any acrylic ester, from about 0.5 percent to about 20 percent by weight of 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate, and up to 30 percent by weight of other copolymerizable vinyl monomer containing a terminal vinylidene group, exhibit improved processing safety when admixed with curatives and when vulcanized exhibit improved oil resistance and low temperature properties.These novel copolymers can also be vulcanized with cure systems that are not effective with some chlorine containing copolymers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The novel elastomers are obtained by copolymerizing together a major amount of acrylate ester monomer with the 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate monomer. The acrylate ester monomers having the formulaEMI1.1 where R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl radical containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl radical containing a total of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and a cyanoalkyl radical containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The alkyl structure can contain primary, secondary, or tertiary carbon configurations.Examples of such acrylic esters are ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, n pentyl acrylate, isoamyl acrylate, n hexyl acrylate, 2 methylpentyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate, 2 ethyl liexyl acrylate, n decyl acrylate, n dodecyl acrylate, noctadecyl acrylate, and the like methoxymethyl acrylate, methoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxyethyl acrylate, butoxy ethyl acrylate, ethoxypropyl acrylate, and the like a and ss cyanoethyl acrylate, a,ss and Y cyanopropyl acrylate, cyanobutyl acrylate, cyanohexyl acrylate, cyanooctyl acrylate, and the like or mixtures thereof. More preferred are the acrylic esters wherein R is an alkyl radical containing 2 to about 10 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalkyl radical containing a total of 2 to about 6 carbon atoms. Examples of such more preferred monomers are ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, n pentyl acrylate, n hexyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, and the like methoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxyethyl acrylate, and the like and mixtures thereof. The acrylic ester monomers are used in amounts of at least 50 percent by weight of the total weight of monomer charged. More preferably, they are used in the range from about 70 percent to about 99 percent by weight of the monomers charged. The 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate monomer is used in the range from about 0.5 percent to about 20 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the monomers charged, and more preferably from about 1 percent to about 5 percent by weight. Other vinyl monomers containing a terminal vinylidene group CH2 C can be polymerized with the acrylate esters as long as an elastomeric polymer is obtained. These monomers are normally used in amount up to about 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of monomers charged.Examples of such monomers are vinyl and allyl ethers such as vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, allyl methyl ether, and the like vinyl and allyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, allyl acetate, allyl laurate, and the like vinyl ketones such as methyl vinyl ketone, ethyl vinyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone, hydroxymethyl vinyl ketone, and the like methyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, phenyl acrylate, and the like methacrylates such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, and the like vinyl aromatics such as styrene and its alkyl and halo substituents, vinyl toluene, and the like vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, and the like vinyl nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid 8 cyanoalkyl acrylates as ethyl, and the like and also dienes and divinyls such as butadiene, isoprene, 1,4 hexadiene, and the likes and divinyl ether, diallyl ether, divinyl benzene, diethylene glycol diacrylate, and the like divinyl benzene and mixtures thereof. The more preferred copolymerizable monomers are vinyl acetate, methyl and ethyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylic and methacrylic acid. The use of these monomers contributes favorably to specific properties of the novel acrylic ester elastomers such as solvent and oil resistance, flame retardancy, and the like. A useful combination of acrylic esters is at least 35 percent of an alkyl acrylate s and up to 64 percent by weight of an alkoxy acrylate s based on the weight of monomer charged. The acrylate ester elastomers can be prepared using emulsion, suspension, solution, and the bulk techniques, all known to those skilled in the art. The monomers are usually polymerized to 90 percent conversion or over. Emulsion and suspension techniques are usually employed. The polymer ization can be performed as batch reactions, or one or more ingredients can be proportioned during the run, or continually. Temperatures of polymerization normally range from about 100C. to about 950C., whereas a more preferred range is from about 50C. to about 500C. The polymerizations are preferably conducted in the absence of air or oxygen. The polymerization may be initiated by freeradical generating agents. Examples of such agents are organic peroxides and hydroperoxides such as benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, paramethane hydroperoxide, and the like used alone or with redox systems azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile, and the like persulfate salts such as sodium, potassium, and ammonium persulfate, used alone or with redox systems and the use of ultraviolet light with photosensitive agents such as benzophenone, triphenylphosphine, organic azos, and the like. The monomers also copolymerize rapidly on heating alone. Typical emulsion polymerization ingredients would include a persulfate salt or an organic peroxide, including redox systems, water adjusted to a desired pH with acids or bases, and usually buffered with inorganic salts, and either anionic, cationic, or nonionic surface active agents. Examples of such surface active agents are sodium, potassium, sulfonate, and phosphate esters of fatty acids, and alkyl and alkaryl salts, quaternary ammonium salts, polyglycol fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylated alkylated phenols, and the like, and may even be substantially emulsifier free. The resulting latices are stable emulsions, and may be handled and used as such. For example, they may be used to impregnate papers and other nonwoven materials to impart water resistance or increased wet and solvent tensile strength to the nonwoven. The latices can be coagulated to isolate the elastomer. Typical coagulation procedures are salt acid coagulations the use of polyvalent metal salts such as CaC12, MgSO4, A12 S04 3, and A1C13 use of alcohols such as methanol freeze agglomeration, and the like. The elastomer obtained is usually washed with water and dried. The polymers are solid elastomers having a dilute solution viscosity DSV of over 0.5 as measured on a 0.4 percent by weight of polymer solution in methylethyl ketone.The DSV is measured on the soluble portion of the polymer.Percent gel, or insolubles, of the polymers range from about 0 to over 60 by weight of the polymer. Raw polymerMooney values range preferably from about 20 to about 150 as measured at 2120F. using a large rotor ML 4, 2120F. . The polymers contain from about 0.2 percent to about 12.0 percent by weight of bromine as provided by 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate, and more preferably from about 0.5 percent to about 3.0 percent by weight of bromine. The polymers are readily admixed with vulcanizing agents, and other compounding ingredients using two roll mills, internal mixers such as Banburys and extruders, and like equipment. Examples of vulcanizing agents are primary and secondary. polyamines such as hexamethylenediamine carbamate, triethylenediamine, triethylenetetraamine, N ,N dicinnamyl idene 1,6 hexanediamine, and the like lead peroxide, lead tetraoxide, sulfur donors such as dipentamethylenethiuram hexasulfide, triethylthiuram disulfide, 2 mercaptoimidazoline, and the like, dithiocarbamates used with trithiocyanuric acid and ammonium salts of acids such as ammonium benzoate, ammonium adipate, ammonium stearate, other compounding ingredients usually mixed with the polymers are stabilizers and antioxidants such as hindered phenols, phosphated phenols, and amines like phenyl B naphthylamine, and the like fillers such as carbon blacks, clays, silicas, asbestos, fiberglass, and the like plasticizers, waxes, and oils processing aids and other ingredients known to those skilled in the art. The elastomers are cured at a temperature from about 2500F. to about 4500F., whereas a temperature range from about 2750F. to about 4000F. is more preferred. Cure time varies with cure temperature, ranging from about 2 minutes at 4000F. to over 20 minutes at 2700F. The polymers are typically tempered for about 1 hour to about 24 hours at a temperature from about 3000F. to about 4000F. The previously known acrylic ester elastomer compositions having halogen cure sites have a tendency to precure after the vulcanizing agents have been admixed. The phenomenon is called scorching, and it is evidenced by the polymer becomming tough and hard to process. Lower processing temperatures and the use of slow curing vulcanizing agents can increase processing safety but this also results in increased operating time per unit and lower productivity.The elastomers of this invention provide increased process safety without increasing total processing or cure time.The use of the novel elastomers is particularly advantageous in injection molding and extrusion processes, as higher temperatures can be employed without fear of scorching the polymer. The scorch time can be determined by following ASTMProcedure D 1646. This method covers the use of a shearing disk viscometer, commonly called Mooney viscometer, when applied to rubber or other elastomeric materials. The onset of vulcanization can be detected by an increase in viscosity.The scorch or maximum processing time at a given temperature is determined by the time required for a given increase above the minimum. When a large rotor is used the increment is 5 units t5 . The cured vulcanizates of these elastomers have the heat resistance, oil resistance, and oxygen and ozone resistance characteristic of polyacrylic ester elastomers, and are useful to prepare gaskets, seals, packings, coatings, and the like. The following examples further illustrate the invention. Ingredients are given in parts by weight unless otherwise indicated. Testing was conducted according to ASTM procedures. Tensile and elongation followed ASTM D412 hardness, ASTM D676 Durometer A oil aging and swell, ASTMD471 and raw polymer Mooney following ASTM D1646, run as ML 4 2l20F. The test for scorch time determination was previously defined. EXAMPLE I Two different copolymers of ethyl acrylate and 2,3dibromopropyl acrylate were prepared using the following recipe 1 2 Ethyl Acrylate 96.0 98.0 2,3 dibromopiopyl acrylate 4.0 2.0 Gafac PE 510 2.0 2.0 NaOH 0.1 0.1 Na2SO4 2 9.3 0.3 Daxad 172 3 0.5 0.5 Hampene 100 4 0.024 0.024 Hampshire NaFe4 0.01 0.01 Na2S204 0.02 0.02 Sodium formaldehyde 0.04 0.04 sulfoxalate Paramethane hydroperoxide 0.07 0.07 Water 100.0 100.0 Temperature, OC. 19.5 19.5 Percent conversion 98.8 99.0 Raw Polymer Mooney, ML 4 212 F. 70 64 DSV 1.59 1.74 Percent gel MEK 58 54 1 alkylphenoxypolyethyleneoxyethyl ester of phosphoric acid 2 sodium salt of polymerized naphthalene sulfonic acid 3 tetrasodium ethylenediamine tetracetate 4 sodium ferric salt of ethylene diamine tetracetic acid The acrylic ester monomer s , the vinyl benzyl chloride, Gafac PE510, NaOH, Daxad 17, Hampshire NaFe, and one half of the water were charged to a premix tank and agitated. The remainder of the water and the Hampene 100 and the Na2SO4 were charged to a reactor vessel equipped for agitation. About 5 percent by weight of the premix solution was then charged to the reactor followed by the Na2S204, the sodium formaldehyde sulfoxalate, and the paramethane hydroxide. The reactor was evacuated of air, closed and the emulsion agitated. The remainder of the premix solution was proportioned into the reactor over two hours time. Portions of the dried polymers were compounded with 100 weight parts of polymer, 2 weight parts of N,N ethylenebisstearamide, 65 weight parts of FEF carbon black, 5 weight parts lead tetroxide, 3 weight parts of 2 mercaptoimidazoline.Rheometer test values at 1700C., 900 cpm, 30 arc. square die 20 minutes were ML, lbf in. 1 25.5, 2 24.5 ts2 min. 1 5.5, 2 6.0 M H lbf in. 1 45.5, 2 36.0 MA EMI8.1 lbf in. 1 20.0, 2 11.5. Portions of these compounds were cured for 10 minutes at 3380F. The resulting vulcanizates had 100 moduli of 1 600 psi and 2 320 psi, tensile strengths of 1 1620 psi and 2 1330 psi and elongations of 1 300 and 2 510 . Vulcanized samples were first heated tempered for 3 hours at 3470F. and then heated air aged in open tubes for 70 hours at 3750F. The tensile strengths after this aging were 1 1590 psi and 2 1460 psi and both samples passed a 1800 bend.These two polymers were also readily cured with hexamethylene diamine carbamate used in place of the lead tetroxide and 2 mercaptoimidazoline.These vulcanizates had tensile strengths of 1 1300 psi and 2 1100 psi, elongations of 1 400 and 2 500 and 100 moduli of 1 380 psi and 2 290 psi. After air aging as above, the tensile strength of the samples were 1830 psi and 1600 psi and both samples passed a 180 bend test. That these copolymers can be cured with red lead is a surprising and valuable property. This system provides a more stable stock with improved scorch resistance and safer processing time. These vulcanizates have better oil resistance than comparable acrylate polymers. This is observed in the low volume change in ASTM 3 oil. For polymer 1 above after aging 70 hrs. at 3020F. in ASTM 3 oil, the volume change was 12.5 vs. more typical 15 for previous polyacrylates. When these examples are repeated with 5 to 10 parts of the ethyl acrylate replaced with butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile or styrene, copolymers vulcan ized having similar excellent cured physical properties are obtained. EXAMPLE II Another series of copolymers were prepared following the general procedure of Example I, in this case prepared with 1 96 weight parts of ethyl acrylate and 4 weight parts of 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate and 2 95 weight parts ethyl acrylate and 4 weight parts 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate and 1 weight part methacrylic acid. The resulting polymers hadMooney viscosity values of 1 70 and 2 82. 100 weight parts of samples of these two copolymers were compounded with 2 weight parts of N,N ethylenebie stearamide, 65 weight parts of FEF carbon black, 5 weight parts of lead tetroxide and 4 weight parts of 2 mercaptoimidazoline. The compounds hadMooney viscosities of 1 83 and 2 84 minutes at 1310C. with a large rotor. Rheometer data obtained on these compounds were ML, lbfein. 1 25.5, 2 26.0 ts2 min. 1 2 6.5 M H , lbf.in. 1 45.5, 2 39.5 Md lbf.in. 1 EMI9.1 20.0, 2 13.0. After curing for 10 minutes and 3380F. in press, the vulcanizates had 100 moduli of 1 600 psi and 2 400 psi, tensile strengths of 1 1620 psi and 2 1470 psi, elongations of 1 300 and 2 400 and hardness values of 1 70A and 2 68A. Samples tempered 3 hrs. at 3470F.and aged for 70 hrs. at 3750F. had tensile strengths of 1 1590 psi and 2 1560 p8i, hardness values of 1 86A and 2 84A and passed a 1800 bend test. After exposure to ASTM 3 oil for 70 hours at 1500C. 100 moduli were 1 1430 psi and 2 980 psi, tensile strengths 1 1670 psi and 2 1990 psi elongations of 1 120 and 2 170 , and hardness of 1 69A and 2 63A, and both samples passed a 1800 bend test. Quite surprisingly, copolymers of ethyl acrylate containing 1 5 weight percent of 1 vinyl benzyl chloride, or 2 vinyl chloroacetate have very poor scorch safety when using the lead tetroxide and 2 mercaptoimidazoline cure system, and copolymers of ethyl acrylate containing 1 5 weight percent of cyclolchloroacetate or epoxy types e.g., glycidyl acrylate exhibit very poor cures using this cure system.EMI9.2 EXAMPLE III Another series of copolymers were prepared following the procedure and using the recipe of Exampie I with 1 96 weight parts ethyl acrylate, 3.2 weight parts 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate and 0.8 methacrylic acid, and 2 95.6 weight parts ethyl acrylate, 3.2 weight parts 2,3 dibromopropyl acrylate and 1.2 weight parts cyanoethyl acrylate. The resulting copolymers obtained in good yield after drying hadMooney values of 69 ML. Portions of the dried copolymers were compounded based on 100 weight parts of copolymer of 2 weight parts of N,N ethylenebis stearamide, 1 weight part stearic acid, 65 weight parts FEF carbon black, 5 weight parts of I lead tetroxide and 3 weight parts of 2 mercaptoimidazoline.The resulting compound had Mooney viscosities of 1 76 and 2 68 at 2500F. and vulcanizates cured at l0 minutes and 3380F., 100 moduli 500 psi and 360 psi, tensile strengths of 1760 psi and 1400 psi, elongations of 350 and 450 . Samples after aging tempering for 3 hours at 3470F.and in air aging for 70 hours at 3750F. had tensile strengths of 1550 psi and 1600 psi, hardness of 89A and 86A and passed 1800 bend. When these compounds were compounded with 1.5 weight parts II tetraethylene tetramine and mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide instead of the lead tetroxide and 2mercaptoimidazoline moduli at 100 of 1 520 and 2 410 psi, tensile strengths of 1 1740 and 2 1460 psi, elongations of 1 320 and 2 380 and hardness values of 1 68A and 2 67A were obtained. Rheometer data obtained on the compounds were Copolymer 1 1 2 2 Cure System I II I II ML, lbf in. 25.5 25.5 23.0 23.5 ts2, min. 4.2 3.4 4.5 4.2 M H , lbf in. 44.5 40.0 41.5 34.0 M , lbf in. 19.0 14.5 18.5 10.5The rheometer data shows that a reasonable state of cure and processing safety can be obtained with both polymers in both cured systems. These copolymers find applications where the normal acrylic ester polymers are used, and because of the good heat aging and oil resistance, and adaptability to a useful cure system, find particular utility in automotive oil seals, oil resistant hoses, oil resistant rolls, wire covering and jacketing, and the like.
