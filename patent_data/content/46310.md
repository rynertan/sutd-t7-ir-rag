# Axial air gap motor.

## Abstract
An inductive electric machine such as an induction motor or a transformer having field and rotor cores, or, respectively, primary and secondary cores, each such core being formed of metal strip 204 punched to have a plurality of holes spaced and located at predetermined positions along the strip 204 so that, when the strip is wound about a central axis, the holes 205, 208, 209 are located so as to form radially extending slots 205, 208, 209 on a face of each such core. Windings 213 can be placed in the slots of the field core and in the slots of transformer cores. A conductor 206 can be placed in the slots of the rotor core.
