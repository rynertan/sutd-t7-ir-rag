# A dry cement composition.

## Abstract
A dry cement composition packed for shipment to the final user contains an amount of ferrous sulphate FS for eliminating or substantially reducing the content of water soluble chromate. The cement composition may be pro duced by grinding a starting material C, G in a cement mill, and passing the ground cement material from the mill to a storage container 33 . The ferrous sulphate in an amount of 0.01 10 and preferably 0.4 percent by weight is added to and mixed with the starting material in a dry or non dissolved condition at a location or at locations upstreams of the storage container 33 . The ferrous sulphate is preferably added to the starting material upstream of the cement mill.
