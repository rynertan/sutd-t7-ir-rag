## Description
DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING IRON AND ENTERICALLY COATED CALCIUM TECHNICAL FIELD This application relates to dietary supplements useful In simultaneously delivering Iron and calcium. Calcium and iron are Important minerals in the human diet.Calcium is the primary mineral In bone building. Iron is a key metal for a number of biologically important compounds, especially hemoglobin in blood. Chronic calclum deficiency can eventually result In the serious bone loss disease known as osteoporosis.Failure to include enough iron in the diet can lead to a number of disorders, in particular Iron deficiency anemia. Those individuals who are at significant risk to calcium orIron deficiencies need to increase thelr dietary intake of these minerals. This can be accomplished by including In the diet foods rich In calcium and iron. However, compliance with such diets Is often difficult, especially in today s world of eating on the go. ready to serve meals and diet fads. Frequently, supplement tablets containing these minerals are used to insure an adequate dietary intake of calcium and Iron. Certain population groups, in particular pre menopausal women, are prone to both calcium and Iron deficiencies. However, taking calcium and iron at the same time can lead to adverse interactions between these minerals. It Is known that calcium supplementation can adversely affect Iron absorption In animals. See Barton et al., Calcium Inhibition of Inorganic IronAbsorption In Rats, Gastroenterology, Vol. 84, t983 , pp. 90 101 rats consuming high calcium diets of marginal iron content developed mild Iron deficiency anemia Chapman et al., Effect of Calcium and Phosphorous Salts on the Utilization of Iron byAnemic Rats, Brit. J. Nutr., Vol. 11, 1957 , pp. 127 33 addition of relatively large amounts of calcium salts to bread diets adversely affects utilization of iron by anemic rats . It has also been found in clinical studies Involving women conducted forThe Procter s Gamble Company the assignee of this application , that simultaneous administration of calcium and iron decreases the absorption of iron. The U.S. recommended dally altowance USRDA of calcium is 1000 mg day. By contrast, the USRDA for iron is 18 mglday. Accordingly, a high calcium to Iron weight ratio is required to meet human nutritional needs. However, It Is believed that a high calcium to Iron ratio causes the adverse interaction between these minerals. By being in large excess, calcium interferes with iron absorption in the small intestine. The result is a substantial decrease in the amount of iron absorbed. There are several ways to avoid this calcium iron interaction. One is the time separated dose method where calcium and iron supplements are taken at different times. It has been found that taking a calcium supplement at least two hours after the iron supplement avoids adverse mineral interactions.However, this time separated dose method is burdensome because the individual must remember when to take the calcium supplement. This burden can be especially great since the time between taking the iron and calcium supplements is relatively long two hours . Another method is to minimize the level of calcium in the supplement. See U.S. Patent 4,431,634 to Ellenbogen, filedDecember 21, 1981, issued February 14, 19811 bioavallability of iron enhanced by minimizing the level of calcium and magnesium carbonates and oxides to no more than 300 mg and 75 mg, respectively . This method appears to operate by reducing the amount of calcium which can interfere with iron absorption in the intestine. However, minimizing the level of calcium in the supplement would require multiple, time spaced doses to achieve the rather high USRDA requirements for calcium. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide a supplement which can simultaneously deliver iron and high levels of calcium without adverse mineral Interactions. BACKGROUND ARTA. Calcium interactions with ironBarton et al., Calcium Inhibition of Inorganic Iron Absorption InRats, Gastroenteroiogy, Vol. 84, 1983 , pp. 90 101, descrlbe a study on the relationship between dietary calcium content andIron absorption In experiments involving rats. In these experiments, the rats were fed diets containing low to high levels of calcium in conjunction with normal to severely low levels of iron.Animals fed the high calcium, normal iron diet developed iron depletion while rats consuming the high calcium diets of marginalIron content developed mild iron deficiency anemia. From this,Barton et al. concluded that calcium significantly diminished the absorption of ferrous and ferric iron in a dose related manner.Barton et al. further suggest that individuals consuming a high calcium diet containing marginal amounts of iron could develop iron deficiency anemia and that this may explain why infants fed cow s milk have a greater incidence of iron deficiency anemia than those fed human milk. Cow s milk has 3 to 4 times the concentration of calcium compared to human milk . See also Chapman et al., Effect of Calcium and Phosphorous Salts on the Utilization ofIron by Anaemic Rats, Brat. J. Nutr., Vol. II, 1957 , pp.127 33 addition of relatively larger amounts of calcium salts to bread diets adversely affects utilization of iron by anemic rat .Monsen et al., Food Iron Absorption in Human Subjects TheEffects of Calcium and Phosphate Salts on the Absorption ofNonheme Iron, Am. J. Clin. Nutr., Vol. 29, 1976 , pp. 1142 48, describes a clinical study where test meals containing varying levels of calcium and phosphorous were fed to 34 male and female volunteers ranging from 17 34 years in age. From these studies,Monsen et al. concluded that a significant reduction In nonheme iron absorption was observed In the presence of calcium and phosphate salts as compared to absorption in their absence. U.S. Patent 4,431,634 to Ellenbogen, filed December 21, 1981, issued February 14, 1984, discloses a prenatal multi mineral supplement composition having enhanced Iron bloavallability. The bioavallability of iron Is enhanced by minimizing the level of calcium and magnesium carbonates and oxides present to no more than 300 mg and 75 mg, respectively. Indeed, the level of calcium and magnesium In these supplements can be reduced to 0.See column 2, line 20 22. See also, Seligman et al., Measurements of Iron Absorption from Prenatal Multivftamin Supplements, Obstetrics 6 Gyn., Vol. 61, 1983 , pp. 356 62, where the adverse effect of calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide on the absorption of prenatal Iron supplements is also noted.B. Separating components in calcium supplementU.S. Patent 3,345,265 to Grodberg et al., issued October 3, 1967, discloses a multl layer vitamin and mineral tablet containing sodium fluoride and calcium carbonate. As described in this patent, sodium fluoride reacts with calcium carbonate to form undesired, Insoluble calcium fluoride. This problem is solved by physically separating the sodium fluoride and calcium carbonate In the tablet. Physical separation is accomplished by forming calcium carbonate, vitamins and other minerals e.g. ferrous sulfate into a core which is separated from the sodium fluoride by at least one layer of a soluble sugar coating. By the time the calcium carbonate goes into solution, the sodium fluoride from the tablet has been dissolved and absorbed. U.S. Patent 2,410,417 to Anderson, issued November 5, 1946, discloses a vitamin and mineral supplement which contains calcium, preferably as the phosphate salt. The vitamins, as well as certain of the minerals, are separated or isolated through the use of protective coatings to prevent adverse interactions. In particular, iron is isolated from the vitamins through the use of a protective coating. See also U.S. Patent 2,887,436 to Klioze et al., Issued May 19, 1959, which discloses dietary supplements containing calcium and iron where the incompatible vitamins and minerals are incorporated Into separate granules. C. Enteric coatings for aspirinIt Is well known that analgesics such as aspirin cause Irritation of the stomach. To prevent this IrrItation, the aspirin particles can be entericaily coated to permit passage through the stomach andInto the intestlnes where the coating Is dissolved so that the aspirin is released and absorbed. Representattve of such enterlcally coated asplrin products are those disclosed In EuropeanPatent Application 94,123 to Dahl, published November 16, 1983 European Patent Application 94,116 to Close et al., publishedNovember 16, 1983 and European Patent Application 94,117 to Leis et at. published November 16, 1983. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present Invention relates to dietary calcium and iron supplements. The supplement comprises nutritionally effective amounts of both a source of absorbable and bloavailable calcium and source of absorbable and bloavailable Iron. The supplement further includes a delayed release coating which surrounds the calcium source. The Iron source is positioned In the supplement so that the delayed release coating substantially prevents the calcium source from inhibiting the biological absorption of Iron In the iron source. The dietary calcium and Iron supplements of the present invention permit the sfmultaneous delivery of these minerals particularly a desirable high weight ratio of calcium to iron without adverse interactions. It is believed that the delayed release coating surrounding the calcium source substantially prevents the release of this mineral until after the supplement reaches the small intestine. It is also believed that the iron in the supplement ts substantially absorbed prior to the release of the calcium. Accordingly, the mechanism which causes interaction between these two minerals is avoided.A. General Definitions As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable or pharmacolcsgically acceptable means the ingredients used in the supplements of the present invention are suitable for use by humans or other mammals, without undue toxicity, Irritation, allergic response, or the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. As used herein, the term comprising means various other compatible components, Including both active and inert ingredients, can be conjointly employed in the supplements of the present Invention. The term comprising encompasses the more restrictive terms consisting essentially of and consisting of .B. Dietary Calcium and Iron Supplement The dietary supplement of the present invention basically comprises 1 a source of calcium 2 a delayed release coating and 3 a source of iron. Suitable sources of calcium are those calcium salts which are phdrmaceutlcally acceptable, biologically absorbable and provide bloavailable calcium. Generally, preferred calcium salts are those which are the most absorbable and bloavailable and which have the densest crystalline forms. Suitable calcium salts include calcium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, calcium citrate, calcium malate, calcium phosphate, calcium oxide, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium lactate, calcium orotate, calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium sulfate, calcium gluconate, calcium levulinate, calcium hydroxyapatite, calcium caseinate, calcium glubionate, and mixtures thereof.These calcium salts can be obtained synthetically, from mineral sources or from animal sources, e.g. oyster shells, bone meal, egg shells. Particularly preferred calcium salts are calcium carbonate, and mixtures of calcium citrate and calcium ma late. With regard to calcium carbonate, the crystalline forms known as calcite, or the more dense form known as aragonite, can be used. With regard to mixtures of calcium citrate and calcium malate, citric and malic acid 1 1 mole ratio are dissolved in water and then calcium carbonate is added to this solution such that the mole ratio of calcium carbonate to citric acid to malic acid is from about 1.0 2.0 2.0 to about 1.0 0.1 0.1, preferably 1.0 0.5 0.5. After the evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased, the solution is dried freeze dried or oven dried to obtain the mixture of calcium citrate and calcium malate. The calcium source ts included in the supplement in a nutri tionally effective amount. As used herein, the term nutritionally effective amount with regard to the calcium source refers to an amount of calcium sufficient to provide a nutrltional benefit to the individual taking the supplement. The particular amount of calcium included in the supplement typically depends upon the calcium source used and its density usually determined by Its crystalline form , as well as the nutritional benefits desired.Usually, the calcium source is included In the supplement at from about 100 to about 1500 mg. based on the weight of the calcium present In the source. Preferably, the calcium source is includedIn an amount from about 100 to about 1000 mg. by weight calcium.The amount of calcium Included in the supplement can be a por tion or all of the U.S. recommended dally allowance IUSRDA for calcium. A key component in the supplements of the present invention is the delayed release coating. As used herein, the term delayed release coating refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable coating which at least substantially prevents the release of the calcium source for absorption until It reaches the small intestine.As used herein, substantially prevents typically means that greater than about 908 of the calcium source has not been dissolved by the time the supplement reaches the small intestine. It is to be understood that the term substantially prevents can include situations where more than 10 of the calcium source is dissolved a so long as the undesirable Interactions between calcium and iron are avoided. These delayed release coatings generally fall into four categories 1 pH sensitive 2 enzyme sensitive 3 Infusive and 4 slowly soluble. The pil sensitive coatings are referred to In the present application as enteric coatings. As used herein, the term enteric coating includes any pharmaceutically acceptable coatingInsoluble at pHs of from about 1 to about 3 while being soluble at pHs in the range of from about 4.5 to about 8.0. Suitable enteric materials include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate succinate, acrylic and methacrylic anlÏnic polymers such as Eudraglt L and S sold byRohm Pharma, and polyvinyl acetyl phthalate, as well as mixtures of these materials.The particularly preferred enteric material is cellulose acetate phthalate. Optlonal components suitable forInclusion in the enteric coating are surface active agents, inert solids such as talc, and plasticizers such as triethyl citrate a triacetin, triglycerides and acetylated monoglycerides. The enzyme sensitive coatings are referred to in the present application as enteral enzyme degradable coating. As used herein1 the term enteral enzyme degradable coating refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable coating which remains substantially intact in the stomach but which is degradable by enzymes in the small intestine. Sultable enteral enzyme degradable materials include the lipids, such as naturally occurring fat and oils, as well as protein materials such as zein and albumin.Other suitable lipids include glyceryl tristearate, glyceryl tripalmitate, monopalmityl distearyl trlglycerlde, dipalmityl monostearyl trigylceride, sorbitan tristearate, hexaglycerol hexapalmitate, hexag lycerol hexastearate, decag lycerol decapalmitate, decag lycerol decastearate, and mixtures thereof.As with the enteric coatings1 optional components such as plasticizers and binders can be included In the enzyme degradable coatings. The next category of delayed release coatings are the infusive ones. As used herein, the term infusion coating refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable coating which remains intact in the gastrointestinal tract, but permits the infusion of digestive fluids to dissolve the calcium source. Suitable infusive coating materials include ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, and quaternary ammonium substituted acrylic resins such as Eudragit RL and RS sold by Röhm Pharma. As with the enterk and enzyme degradable coatings, optional components such as plasticizers and soluble materials to enhance diffusion can be included in the infusive coatings. The last category of delayed release coatings are the slowly soluble type. As used herein, the term slowly soluble coating refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable coating whose dissolution rate In digestive flulds Is such that the calcium sourceIs not substantially released until the supplement reaches the small intestine. The slowly soluble coating composition and thickness are usually adjusted so that the calcium source is released about 2 hours or more after ingestion of the supplement. Suitable materials for slowly soluble coatings include the polyethylene glycols, glycerol monostearate and beeswax. The delayed release coating material is used in an amount sufficient to provide an adequate coating to surround the calcium source to prevent it from inhibiting the biological absorption of the iron in the iron source. The amount of delayed release material necessary to provide an adequate coating is highly dependent on the coating used and the surface area of the calcium source which needs to be surrounded. The surface area of the calcium source Is highly dependent on the amount used as well asIts form. For tablet products to be hereafter defined, the amount of delayed release coating material necessary Is typically from about 1 to about 20 by weight of the calcium source and preferably from about 2 to about 10 by weight of the calcium source.For capsule products to be hereafter defined, the amount of delayed release coating material necessary is typically from about 2 to about 258 by weight of the calcium source, and preferably from about 5 to about 158 by weight of the calcium source. Iron sources which can be used in the supplement of the present invention are those which are pharmaceutically acceptable, biologically absorbable and provide bloavallable iron.Accordingly, both heme and nonheme iron sources can be used.Generally, suitable Iron sources are those iron salts which are water soluble, especially the ferrous salts. Suitable iron saltsInclude ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous ascorbate, ferrous succinate, ferrous lactate, ferric ammonium citrate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferroglycine sulfate, and mixtures thereof. The preferred Iron salts are ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate. The iron source is Included in the supplement In a nutritionally effective amount. As used herein, the term nutritionally effective amount with regard to the iron source refers to an amount of Iron sufficient to provide nutritional benefits to theIndividual taking the supplement. The amount of iron Included in the supplement will typically depend upon the nutritional needs of the individual. Suitable amounts of the iron source range from about 1 to about 50 mg. based on the weight of iron present in the iron source. Preferred levels of the iron source range from about 6 to about 25 mg. by weight Iron. The amount of iron included in the supplement can be a portion or all of the USRDA for iron. Within the weight ranges of calcium and iron specified, the weight ratio of calcium relative to Iron is especially important.As previously discussed, it Is believed that the reason for the adverse interaction between these minerals is due to the large amount of dietary calcium required relative to the small amount of dietary Iron. Accordingly, the supplements of the present invention are particularly suitable for simultaneously delivering this high weight ratio of calcium to Iron. In terms of defining these weight ratios, the amount of calcium in the calcium source Is measured relative to the amount of Iron in the iron source. Typically, the weight ratio of calcium to iron is from about 10 1 to about 150 1. Preferably, the weight ratio of calcium to iron is from about 20 1 to about 90 1. The iron source is positioned In the supplement so that the delayed release coating can substantially prevent the calcium source from inhibiting the biological absorption of Iron from the iron source. This usually means placing the iron source so that it Is out of contact with the calcium source. For example, the iron source can be formulated as a discrete component from the coated calcium source. Typically, the iron source is adhered to the exterior surface of the delayed release coating Other optional Ingredients typically included In dietary supplements or other pharmaceutical compositions can be used.For example, vitamins and other minerals can be used In dietary supplements of the present Inventlon. Suitable vitamins includeA, D, E, C, 61, B2, B6, 612, nlacin, folic acid, thlamine, biotin and rlboflavin. Other minerals which can be Included In the supplement Include zinc, potassium, magnesium, manganese and copper. Those vitamins and minerals which adversely Interact with calcium should be positioned in the supplement so that the delayed release coating can substantially prevent the calcium source from interacting with them.B. Method for making dietary supplements in tablet and capsule form The dietary calcium and iron supplements of the present invention can be made in capsule or tablet form. See Lieberman et al, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Tablets, Volume 3, 1982 , pp. 108 110 incorporated by reference , for a general description of methods for making tablets with delayed release coatings. For the capsule form, the supplement comprises a suitable calcium source in the form of a multiplicity of granules. These granules typically have a particle size of about 250 microns to about 2000 microns. Preferably, these granules have a particle size of from about S00 to about 1200 mkrons. The coating of delayed release material surrounds each of the granules. A suitable Iron source Is included as either discrete granules or is preferably adhered to the exterior surface of the delayed release coating of each of the calcium granules. The granules are contained within an edible casing typically made from gelatin or other suitable edible material. In making the capsule form of the supplement, the calcium source can be formed into granules by several methods.Examples of these methods include coating of inert substrates using fluidized beds, CF granulators or similar devices, roller compaction or slugging and then milling, direct spheronization using fluidized beds, and extruslonispheronizatlon, The calcium granules formed by these methods are sieved to the desired particle size. The calcium granules are then coated with the delayed release material from a solvent solution, a latex suspension or a hot melt. The iron source Is then adhered to each of the coated calcium granules using a fluidized bed, CF granulator or sImilar device. Alternatively, separate granules of the iron source can be prepared as above, and optionally coated with a soluble protective coating and admixed with the calcium granules coated with the delayed release material.Finally, hard gelatin capsules are filled with the coated granules. For the tablet form, a core of the calcium source, plus any optional ingredients, is formed. This core is then surrounded by the coating of delayed release material. The Iron source is then adhered to this coated core. To prevent the oxidation of the iron source, a protective layer of a suitable water soluble or acidsoluble material such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose orEudragit E sold by Rohm Pharma can be coated onto the iron source. In making the tablet form of the supplement, the calcium source, plus any optional ingredients such as binders e.g. gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone , lubricants e.g. stearates , and disintegrants e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, cellulosics are elther directly compacted to form a core or else granulated to form a free flowing powder which Is then compacted to form the core. The coating of delayed release material is then applied to the core using a fluidized bed, pan coater, or compression coating methods. Optionally, granules of the calcium source can be made, coated with the delayed release material, and then the coated granules compressed to form the coated core. The iron source is then applied by spraying, dipping or coating It onto the coated core. Finally, the iron source can be optionally surrounded with the protective coating layer by spraying, dipping or coating.C. Concurrent Administration of Dietary Calcium and Iron. The present invention also relates to a method for supplying both dietary calcium and iron to mammals and particularly humans. This method comprises the steps of orally administeri g to the mammal, In a concurrent fashion a a calcium supplement comprising a nutritionally effective amount of a source óf absorbable and bloavailable calcium surrounded by a delayed release coating as previously denned and b an iron supplement comprising a nutrltionally effective amount of a source of absorbable and bioavallable Iron. The Iron source Is positioned so that the delayed release coating substantially prevents the calcium source from inhibiting the biological adsorption of the iron in theIron source. In practicing this method, the individual can take one of the previously defined dietary calcium and iron supplements. However, the method of the present Invention can also be practiced by concurrently taking a calcium supplement comprising a source of absorbable and bloavallable calcium which Is surrounded by a delayed release coating and a separate iron supplement containing a source of absorbable and bioavailable Iron. As used herein, the term concurrent administration refers to the taking of the calcium source and Iron source simultaneously or substantially simultaneously, e.g., within 15 minutes of each other.

The results were as follows Treatment iron Retention Index Water 33.2 3.7 100 CaCO3 solid 21.6 1.9 65 CaCO3 suspension 20.1 3.3 61 CaCO3 enterically 42.1 3.4 3. L 127 coated As can be seen , the uncoated calcium carbonate solid or suspension significantly decreased iron absorption. By contrast, the entericaily coated calcium carbonate did not decrease iron absorption.
