# Method of controlling the operation of a furnace and an air conditioner.

## Abstract
A duty cycling switch for use with a furnace which mounts onto the exterior wall of the furnace plenum and opens and closes in response to the temperature of the plenum wall. The switch is adjusted to deactivate the burner when the plenum wall heats up to a temperature caused by the continuous operation of the burner for a predetermined period of time. The duty cycling switch acts to reactivate the burner when the plenum cools down below this temperature. A duty cycling switch for use with an air conditioner is also disclosed which mounts onto the plenum wall and opens and closes in response to the temperature of the plenum wall. It is adjusted to de activate the compressor of an air conditioner unit when the plenum wall cools down to a temperature caused by con tinuous operation of the compressor for a first predetermined period of time and reactivates the compressor after the plenum wall exceeds this temperature. The furnace duty cycling switch is preferably an adjustable bimetal which opens on rise. The air conditioner duty cycling switch is a bimetal switch which closes on rise.
