## Description
FLEXOGRAPHIC BELT PRINTING PRESS The present invention is useful in the printing of a continuous web composed of any suitable material, e.g. paper, plastics, or metal. An important application of the invention is in the multi colour flexographic printing of packaging material. It is a known disadvantage to use flexographic printing of a continuous web of packaging material, when the printing pattern on the plate cylinder contains large blank areas which produce corresponding blank areas and hence considerable waste of the web between the repetitive patterns of printed matter. Another disadvantage of using a conventional, flexographic printing press is that the plate cylinder must be changed to accommodate different size printing patterns and printing messages.Further, it is necessary to adjust the positions of the plate cylinder and the transfer and fountain rollers to adapt the press to plate cylinders of varying diameters. In practice, this adjustment is difficult and time consuming. The invention in particular aims to provide a flexographic type printing press in which the aforementioned disadvantages are largely or wholly overcome. Briefly stated, the invention particularly disclosed herein resides in a press which employs certain essential components of a flexographic printing press. The press is provided with a plate cylinder which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis. A continuous belt, carrying printing plates similar to those used in normal flexographic printing, is reeved at least partially around the plate cylinder and properly tensioned to print on a continuous web of any suitable material, e.g. packaging material. An engraved ink transfer roller, rotatable about its longitudinal axis, is disposed adjacent and parallel with the plate cylinder and is movable to and from the plate cylinder for contacting the printing plates carried by the belt. A fountain roller, also rotatable about its longitudinal axis, is positioned adjacent and parallel with the transfer roller.Moreover, the fountain roller is movable to and from the transfer roller for contacting it and coating it with ink carried by the fountain roller. Thus, means are provided for mounting the fountain and transfer rollers for relative movement to and from each other and for movement in unison towards and away from the plate cylinder. A big advantage of using a belt type printing press is that the size and location of the plate cylinder, transfer and fountain rollers need not be changed when the length of the printing pattern is changed. It is only necessary to change the belt to produce different printing patterns or to alter the size of the printed matter on the continuous web. The l arrangement disclosed herein allows for easy belt changing. The following description of an illustrative and non limiting invention will be better understood by having reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a plan view of one example of a belt type printing press in accordance with the invention as seen from the line 1 1 of Figure 2 Figure 2 is a side elevation of the press, as viewed from the line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a side elevation of the press, as viewed from the line 3 3 of Figure 1 and Figure 4 is an end elevation of the press, as viewed from the line 4 4 of Figure 2. With reference to the etaawings, there is shown a belt type printing press 5 which is designed for printing on a continuous web 6 of any suitable material such as paper, plastics, or metal. The printing press 5 comprises an impression cylinder assembly 7 which is in juxtaposed relation vertically above a plate cylinder assembly 8 when the press 5 is in a normal vertical position and rests on a horizontal surface.Impression Cylinder Assembly The impression cylinder assembly 7 comprises an impression cylinder 9 which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis that is normal to the direction in which the continuous web 6 travels as it moves to and from the impression cylinder 9. The impression cylinder 9 is rotatably mounted between a pair of parallel pivot arms 10, 11, each of which have a pair of opposing ends 12, 13. The pivot arms 10, 11 are mounted on the upper framework 14 of the printing press 5 for unitary rotation about an axis which is parallel to the rotational axis of the impression cylinder 9 and located intermediate the opposing ends 12, 13 of the pivot arms 10, 11. A pair of air cylinders 15, 16, designed to function in unison, are operatively connected between the upper framework 14 of the printing press 5 and adjacent ends 13 of the pivot arms 10, 11, to rotate the impression cylinder 9 about the rotational axis of the pivot arms 10, 11, between operating and non operating positions, 1. e. into and out of printing relation with the plate cylinder assembly 8. The free ends 12 of the pivot arms 10, 11 each carry a plurality of adjustable stops 17 19 which are strategically located for engaging a set of correspondingly positioned abutments or stops 17 19 adjacent each of the free ends 12 of the pivot arms 10, 11 to control the positioning of the impression cylinder 9.The vertically uppermost set of stops 17, 17 are used in the positioning of the impression cylinder 9 in its vertically lowermost operatSzgposition relative to the plate cylinder assembly 8. The first to encounter vertically lowermost set of stops 18, 18 are designed to regulate the normal non operating position of the impression cylinder 9, out of printing engagement with the plate cylinder assembly 8. The second to encounter lowermost set of stops 19, 19 are used to regulate the fully retracted position of the impression cylinder 9 away from the plate cylinder assembly 8, to permit the continuous web 6 to be more conveniently threaded through the impression cylinder assembly 7. Similar conventional air cylinders 20 are provided to reposition the first to encounter set of stops 18, 18 to permit engagement of the second to encounter set of stops 19, 19 . A hand operated wheel 21, in conjunction with a p o digital readout devices 22, 23 correlated to the turning of the wheel 21 is provided to help an operator locate the set of operating stops 17, 17 to properly position the impression cylinder 9 for printing relation with the plate cylinder assembly 8. A compensator roller mechanism 24 is used to adjust the length of the pathway which the continuous web 6 travels between a pair of similar adjacent printing presses 5 normally employed in a multi colour printing operation to control the registration of colour to colour. The mechanism 24 comprises a spring biased compensator roller 25 whose vertical position is automatically controlled by operation of a motor, or manually adjusted by a hand operated wheel 26 in conjunction with a pair of digital readout devices 27, 28, similar to that used in adjusting the position of the operating stops 17. The spring biased compensator roller 25 is designed to rotate freely about its longitudinal axis which is parallel to the rotational axis of the impression cylinder 9. Any other suitable means can be used, to bring about registration of colour to colour, if desired. Plate Cylinder Assembly The plate cylinder assembly 8 comprises a plate cylinder 30 which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis that is parallel to the rotational axis of the impression cylinder 9. A continuous flexible belt 31 is at least partially reeved around the plate cylinder 30 and carries a plurality of printing pites similar to those used in a conventional flexographic printing process. The printing plates are bonded in position on the flexible belt 31 which is composed of any suitable material, as is well known in the trade. The belt 31 is also reeved at least partially around a smaller roller 32 which is provided to tension the belt 31 on the plate cylinder 30. The belt tensioning roller 32 is mounted for rotatingfreely about its longitudinal axis which is parallel to the rotational axis of the plate cylinder 30.Any suitable mechanism 33 may be used to adjust the position of the belt tensioning roller 32 relative to the plate cylinder 30, to accommodate belts of different lengths used in the multicolour printing process. For example, the mechanism 33, as best seen inFigure 4, comprises a pair of vertically disposed parallel drive screws 34, 35 which are operatively connected to any suitable drive mechanism 36 for rotating the drive screws 34, 35, in unison. A pair of parallel guide rods 37, 38 are disposed in parallel relation within the drive screws 34, 35, and a pair of carriages 39, 40, are slidably mounted on the guide rods 37, 38, and coupled to the drive screws 34, 35 which, when rotated, cause the carriages 39, 40 to move along the guide rods 37, 38. The belt tensioning roller 32 is rotatably mounted between the carriages 39, 40. The pair of drive screws 34, 35 are allowed to float, i.e. they are mounted for limited axial movement relative to the adjacent guide rods 37, 38 which are fixedly mounted on the lower framework 41 of the printing press 5. A pair of similar, double acting air cylinders 42, 43 are coupled by any suitable means 44 to the drive screws 34, 35 and carriages 39, 40 to counterbalance the weight of the belt tensioning roller 32 and to place a desired, downwardly directed force or load on the carriages 39, 40 to correspondingly move the belt tensioning roller 32 to a position where the belt 31 is placed under a predetermined tension on the plate cylinder 30 for printing engagement with the continuous web 6 passing between the nip of the impression cylinder 9 and plate cylinder 30. A conventional, engraved ink transfer roller 45 and fountain roller 46, as best seen in Figures 2 and 3, are associated with the plate cylinder 30 and employed to transfer ink 47 from a fountain 48 to the printing plates carried by the belt 31. Any suitable mechanism such as an air loaded doctor or scraper blade SB can be used, if desired, to remove excess printing ink from the transfer roller 45. The scraper blade SB can be mounted in a positive angle position, as shown in Figure 2, or a reverse angle position as shown in Figure 3. The fountain 48 is mounted by any appropriate means for movement to and from the fountain roller 46. The transfer roller 45 and fountain roller 46 are, like the belt tensioning roller 32, mounted for rotation about their own particular longitudinal axes which are parallel to the rotational axis of the plate cylinder 30. The transfer roller 45 is rotatably mounted between adjacent ends 49, 50 of a pair of parallel arms 51, 52 which are provided to support both the transfer roller 45 and the fountain roller 46 on the plate cylinder assembly 8.The support arms 51, 52 are mounted for rotation about an axis 53 which is parallel to the rotational axis of the plate cylinder 30 and which is located intermediate the rotational axis of the transfer roller 45 and opposing free ends 54, 55 of the support arms 51, 52. A pair of air cylinders 56, 57 are coupled between the lower framework 41 of the printing press 5 and the adjacent free ends 54, 55 of the support arms 51, 52 to rotate the support arms 51, 52 and nove the transfer roller 45, carried thereby, to and from the plate cylinder 30. The fountain roller 46 is rotatably mounted between a pair of parallel pivot arms 58, 59 intermediate opposing ends 60, 61 and 62, 63 thereof. The ends 60, 61 of the pivot arms 58, 59, closest the transfer roller 45, are pivotally mounted by similar pivot pins 64 to a pair of brackets 65, 66 which project from the support arms 51, 52 in parallel relation adjacent the transfer roller 45. A pair of air cylinders 67, 68 are coupled between the opposing free ends 62, 63 of the pivot arms 58, 59 and the adjacent free ends 54, 55 of the support arms 51, 52 to rotate the fountain roller 46 to and from the transfer roller 45. Thus, the transfer roller 45 and fountain roller 46 are mounted for relative rotational movement to and from each other and for unitary rotational movement i.e. movement in unison towards and away from the plate cylinder 30. A plurality of sets of stops 70, 71 and 72, 73 and 74, 75 similar to those used in conjunction with the support arms 10, 11 of the impression cylinder 9, are provided for coaction with the free ends 54, 55 of the support arms 51, 52 of the transfer roller 45, to position the transfer roller 45 for engagement with, and disengagement from, the printing plates carried by the belt 31 and passing around the plate cylinder 30.The first set of stops 70, 71, closest the free ends 54, 55 of the support arms 51, 52, are utilized to position the transfer roller 45 adjacent the plate cylinder 30 for transferring ink to the printing plates carried by the belt 31. The second set of stops 72, 73 are used to regulate the normal position of the transfer roller 45 out of engagement with the printing plate carried by the flexible belt 31. Conventional air cylinders 76 are also prcrded to retract the stops 73 of the second set of stops 72, 73 out of interference with the coaction of the third set of stops 74, 75, at which point the transfer roller 45 is in farthest spaced relation from the plate cylinder 30.A hand operated wheel 77 arid digital readout devices 78, 79 are likewise employed to position the first set of stops 70, 71 for controlling the ink transferring position of the transfer roller 45 relative to the plate cylinder 30. The plate cylinder 30 and transfer roller 45, as best seen in Figures 1 and 3, are conventionally geared together for synchronized rotation relative to the linear speed at which the web 6 travels between the nip of the impression and plate cylinders 9, 30 and are operated by any appropriate drive mechanism which is coupled to the projecting end 80 of a power input shaft 81 that is geared to the plate cylinder 30 and transfer roller 45. The fountain roller 46 is operated or rotated independently of the transfer roller 45 by any suitable motor means M and at a speed and distance from the transfer roller 45 sufficient to meter a uniform and constant desired flow of ink to the printing plates carried by the belt. 9 A motor driven or hand operated wheel 82 and locking mechanism 83 are provided for use by an operator in axially adjusting the position of the plate cylinder 30 relative to the impression cylinder 9. Thus, there has been described a novel, compact printing press which is especially suitable for use in multi colour printing of a continuous web of any appropriate packaging material. In a specially advantageous arrangement, a number of these compact printing presses are disposed one after the other to successively print upon the moving web, the different colours used in the multi colour printing process.
