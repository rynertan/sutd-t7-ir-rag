# Apparatus for compensation of overshoot, undershoot and delay in response to step signals in a system comprising a reactive filter network.

## Abstract
A compensation circuit for overshoot, undershoot and delay occurring in response to sudden D. C. level changes in signals received by reactive filters. A D. C. level change, represented by an input signal step applied to the reactive filter is detected by the compensation circuit. The compen sation circuit responsively provides a compensation D. C. signal step of a predetermined magnitude and polarity with respect to the input signal step. The compensation step is applied by the circuit to the signal return line of the reac tive filter simultaneously with the input signal step received by the filter to maintain a substantially constant D. C. signal level with respect to the reactive filter elements. The reactive filter elements are thus prevented from charg ing and discharging in response to the input signal step and filter delay is eliminated.
