# Automatic control system for acoustic logging.

## Abstract
An acoustic receiver control circuit for use with an acoustic logging tool having a pulse generating acoustic transmitter and an acoustic receiver for receiving a pulse having traveled along a propagation path, the control circuit comprising an amplifier means connected to the output of a receiver of acoustic pulses for amplifying the received acoustic output pulse signal, said amplifier means having a feedback loop for controlling gain of said amplifier means, said amplifier means further forming an output of the amplified signal wherein the output signal is a function of the gain of said amplifier means and the amplitude of the signal input to said amplifier means, said feedback loop including timing means for rendering said loop operative for a specified interval, and also having means responsive to a specified peak in the received signal amplified thereby to control the gain of said amplifier means.
