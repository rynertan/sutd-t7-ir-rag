# Single step formation of PN junction in silicon cell and coating thereon.

## Abstract
The PN juncture in a silicon chip and an oxide coating on its surface are simultaneously formed from clear solution derived from titanium alkoxides, water, alcohol, a suitable acid, and a P or N dopant by partial hydrolysis and polymeriza tion. The solution is applied to the surface of a silicon chip. The chip is then heated which converts the solution to a solid oxide coating which meets the antireflective optical film requirements and induces the migration of the dopants into the chip, forming a PN junction in the chip. The method also provides deep and uniform junction formation or diffusion without resulting in excessive carrier concentration.
