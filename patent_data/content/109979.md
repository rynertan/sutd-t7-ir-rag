## Description
ROOM TEMPERATURE CURING COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a room temperature curing composition, and more particularly to a one component room temperature curing composition which contains a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a siliconcontaining hydrolyzable group and is curable by absorption of moisture in the atmosphere. Polyoxyalkylene polymers having a siliconcontaining hydrolyzable group which are curable to change into rubber like materials by exposure to moisture in the atmosphere are known. Compositions containing such polyoxyalkylene polymers are for instance usable as sealants for building. As sealants, there are known a two component type that a main component is admixed just before use with a hardener, and a one component type that a main component is previously admixed with a hardener under anhydrous condition and the mixture is stable in a closed state, while hardens by absorbing moisture upon exposure to the atmosphere. Two component compositions have the disadvantages that mixing of two components is troublesome and the mixture must be used up in a certain period. One component compositions are convenient for use in that a mixing procedure is not necessary and the remnant can be stored in a closed container and reused, but the storage stability is in a question. It is an object of the present invention to provide a room temperature curing composition having an excellent storage stability. A further object of the invention is to provide a room temperature curing composition of a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a silicon containing hydrolyzable group which is curable with moisture and can be stably stored in a closed state for a long term. Another object of the invention is to provide a one component room temperature curing composition which is curable with moisture and can be stably stored in a closed state for a long term. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a room temperature curing composition comprising A a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a silicon containing hydrolyzable group and B a hydrolyzable silicon compound. The composition of the invention has an excellent storage stability, and additives such as a filler can be incorporated into the composition without previously drying them. A hydrolyzable silicon compound is employed as a stabilizer in the present invention. The hydrolyzable silicon compound can decrease water in the system, e.g.water included naturally in additives such as a filler and a plasticizer, in a short period of time by causing a condensation reaction with water in the presence of a silanol condensation catalyst as a hardener. That is to say, the hydrolyzable silicon compound has in general a higher hydrolysis reactivity than the silicon containing hydrolyzable group of a polyoxyalkylene polymer having a silicon containing hydrolyzable group, and reacts with water included in the system in preference to the polyoxyalkylene polymer to serve as a dehydrating agent.Also, the hydrolyzable silicon compound and the partial hydrolysis product thereof which remain in the system, function to stabilize the storability of the composition for a long term. The hydrolyzable silicon compounds used in the present invention as a component B are low molecular silicon compounds having a hydrolyzable functional group which reacts in the presence of water. The hydrolyzable silicon compounds having a molecular weight of not more than 300 are preferable. The hydrolyzable silicon compound is employed in such an amount that the total number of moles of the hydrolyzable functional group is at least 2 times the number of moles of water present in the system. Since, if the hydrolyzable silicon compound is too much, it tends to lower the physical properties of the cured product as a sealant and also to lower the curing rate, the upper limit of the amount of the hydrolyzable silicon compound is determined in the light of the desired physical properties of cured products and curing rate. Preferably, the hydrolyzable silicon compound is employed in such an amount that the total number of moles of the hydrolyzable functional group thereof is 2 to 8 times, especially 2.5 to 5 times, the number of moles of water present in the system.In general, the hydrolyzable silicon compound is employed in an amount of 0.01 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight the polyoxyalkylene polymer A . The hydrolyzable functional groups of the hydrolyzable silicon compounds B include, for instance, a halogen, an alkoxyl group, an acyloxy group, a ketoxymate group, an amino group, an aminoxy group, an amide group, a mercapto group, an alkenyloxy group, and the like.Other groups than the hydrolyzable functional groups, e.g.an epoxy containing group, an amino containing group, an acryloyloxy containing group, an methacryloyloxy containing group and a mercapto containing group, may be attached to silicon atom. The hydrolyzable silicon compounds B used in the present invention are compounds of the general formula R Si X n t wherein R is a monovalent organic group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, X is a halogen or a group selected from an alkoxyl group, an acyloxy group, a ketoxymate group, an amino group, an aminoxy group, an amide group, a mercapto group and an alkenyloxy group, and n is 0 or an integer of 1 to 3, and condensed partial hydrolysis products of the compounds of the above general formula. These hydrolyzable silicon compounds and the condensed partial hydrolysis products may be employed alone or in admixture thereof.Representative examples of the hydrolyzable silicon compound B used in the present invention are, for instance, CH3SiCt3, Si OCH3 4, CH3Si OCH3 3,Si OC2H5 4, CH2 CHSi OOCCH3 3,EMI4.1 and condensed partial hydrolysis products of these compounds. The polyoxyalkylene polymer used as a component A in the present invention is a polymer having substantially a structural unit of the formula R10 wherein R1is an alkylene group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and having a silicon containing hydrolyzable end or pendant groups and a molecular weight of 300 to 15,000.The term substantially as used above means that the polymer may contain structural units other than the R10 unit in the main chain. Usually, the polyoxyalkylene polymer A contains at least 50 by weight, especially 80 f by weight, of the R1O units.Representative examples of the silicon containing hydrolyzable group of the polyoxyalkylene polymer A are, for instance, groups of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein R3 is a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent organic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an 4 organosiloxy group, R4 is a saturated or unsaturated monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, b is 0, 1 or 2, c is 0, 1 or 2, and m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 18, preferably groups of the general formula EMI5.2 wherein Z isEMI5.3 which R and R are the same or different and each is a bivalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms,R2 is hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent organic group, especially hydrocarbon group, having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a triorganosiloxy group, R3 is a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent organic group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an organosiloxy group, R4 is a saturated or unsaturated monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a is 0 or 1, b is 0, 1 or 2, c is 0, 1 or 2, and m is 0 or an integer of 1 to 18. Processes for the preparation of the polyoxyalkylene polymer having such an end group are disclosed, for instance, in JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication Tokkyo Kokai No. 156599 1975 and No. 123620 1980. The polyoxyalkylene polymer having such a pendant group is prepared, for instance, by copolymerizing an alkylene glycol with allyl glycidyl ether and subjecting the product to hydrosylylation. A silanol condensation catalyst may be incorporated in the composition of the present invention as a hardener to provide a one component room temperature curing composition. Examples of the silanol condensation catalyst are, for instance, a metal salt of a carboxylic acid such as tin octylate, tin stearate, iron naphthenate or lead octylate, a tetravalent organotin such as di nbutyl tin dilaurate or di n butyl tin diphthalate, an amine such as laurylamine or ethanolamine, and alkyltitanates. These catalysts may be employed alone or in admixture thereof. In the present invention, the silanol condensation catalyst not only serves as a catalyst for a crosslinking reaction of the polyoxyalkylene polymer A , but also accelerates a reaction of the hydrolyzable silicon compound B with water in the stage prior to the crosslinking reaction to remove water present in the composition. Usual fillers and usual plasticizers may be incorporated in the composition of the present invention.Examples of the filler used in the present invention are, for instance, calcium carbonate, kaoline, talc, titanium dioxide, aluminum silicate, carbon black, and the like.The filler is employed in an amount of 0 to 300 parts by weight, especially 0.1 to 300 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer A .Examples of the plasticizer used in the present invention are, for instance, dioctyl phthalate, butylbenzyl phthalate, chlorinated paraffin, epoxidized soybean oil, and the like. The plasticizer is employed in an amount of 0 to 200 parts by weight, especially 0.1 to 200 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyoxyalkylene polymer A . In the present invention, fillers and plasticizers can be employed without previously dehydrating them. If it is possible to decrease the water content by a simple procedure, fillers and plasticizers dehydrated by a procedure such as heat drying may be of course employed. In that case, it is possible to decrease the amount of the hydrolyzable silicon compound B to be used. The composition of the present invention may contain various other additives, e.g. antisagging agent such as hydrogenated castor oil or silicic acid anhydride, antioxidant, ultraviolet absorbent, radical inhibitor, and a peroxide decomposer. For the purpose of adjusting the physical properties of the cured product, the composition of the invention may also contain reactive silicon compounds disclosed in Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication No. 129247 1978, polysiloxanes disclosed inJapanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 21453 1980 and ultraviolet radiation curing resins disclosed inJapanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 36241 1980. The composition of the present invention is prepared usually by admixing the polyoxyalkylene polymer A with additives, and then adding the hydrolyzable silicon compound B to the mixture with agitation in a closed system, thereby causing the hydrolyzable silicon compound B to react with water present in the system to remove it. In case of incorporating a hardener into the composition, the hardener is added to the mixture after adding the hydrolyzable silicon compound B to the mixture of the polyoxyalkylene polymer and additives. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the following Examples in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise noted. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples, and various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.Example 1To an oxypropylene polymer havingEMI7.1 group in 80 ffi of the whole ends and having an average molecular weight of 8,000 were added 34 parts of dioctyl phthalate, 140 parts of calcium carbonate, 20 parts of titanium dioxide, 4 parts of hydrogenated castor oil as an antisagging agent, 1 part of 2,2 methylene bis 4 methyl 6 t butylphenol as an antioxidant commercially available under the commercial name Nocrac NS 6 made by Ouchi Shinko Kabushiki Kaisha and 1 part of bis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidine sebacate as an antioxidant commercially available under the commercial name Sanol LS 770 made by Sankyo Kabushiki Kaisha , per 100 parts of the oxypropylene polymer.
