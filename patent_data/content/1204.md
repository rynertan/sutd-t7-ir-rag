# Binocular system with gyro stabilized image.

## Abstract
An image stabilized optical system in which a pair of telescopic optical systems 10a,10b are arranged in parallel with each other to constitute binoculars. The telescopic optical system is composed of an objective 1a,1b , an eyepiece 2a,2b and an erect prism 3a,3b located between the objective and the eyepiece. The erect prism is capable of having its incident light optical axis and its emanating light optical axis aligned with each other. The objectives 116a,116b and the eyepieces 118a,118b of the pair of telescopic optical systems are fixed to a casing 101,102,103 of the image stabilized optical system, and the erect prisms 105a,105b are mounted on gimbals provided with a gyro and having two axes of rotation intersecting at right angle with each other. The two axes of rotation of the gimbals are included in a plane perpendicular to the main optical axes 4a,4b of the telescopic optical systems.
