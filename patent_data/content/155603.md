# Cladding tube for nuclear fuel and nuclear fuel element having this cladding tube.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a cladding tube for a nuclear fuel and a nuclear fuel element incorporating the cladding tube. The cladding tube consists of an inner zirconium liner layer 6 34 and an outer zirconium alloy layer 1 . The cladding tube has at least one of the following features. I the ratio a b of the oxygen content a to iron content b in the zirconium liner layer 6 34 is greater than 1.0, II the zirconium liner layer 34 is made of a zirconium into the matrix of which impurities are dissolved, and III the second phase particles having microscopic sizes and dispersed in the inner surface of the zirconium liner layer 6 and or the outer surface of the zirconium alloy layer 1 have been removed substantially. Owing to these features, undesirable stress corrosion crack ing and local corrosion are remarkably suppressed in the cladding tube 6, 1 34, 1 and the nuclear fuel element of the invention.
