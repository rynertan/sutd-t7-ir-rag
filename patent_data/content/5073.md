# Continuous process for producing a vinyl acetate ethylene copolymer emulsion emulsion obtained.

## Abstract
A continuous process for producing a vinyl acetate ethylene copolymer emulsion comprises continously charging a reaction mixture containing inter alia vinyl acetate and ethylene into an initial polymerization zone, conducting an initial polymerization of the vinyl acetate and ethylene in the presence of a seed latex under ethylene pressure, continuously removing the thus formed emulsion from the initial polymerization zone at an unreacted vinyl acetate monomer content of from 5 to 20 by weight of the emulsion and a glass transition temperature of from minus 20 C to plus 10 C and then effecting a post polymerization of the unreacted vinyl acetate at an ethylene pressure of not more than 300 psia until the unreacted vinyl acetate in the emulsion is less than 1 by weight.
