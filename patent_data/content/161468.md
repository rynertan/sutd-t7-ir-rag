## Abstract
Peptides and Peptide amides such as chlolecystokinin CCK 8 are synthesized in improved yields and purity by a solid phase process. The requisite protected peptide is elaborated and sulfated on a solid support, deprotected, and cleaved from the solid support to give the total synthesis of CCK 8 on a solid support. Thereafter, the peptide is purified in a single step by ion exchange chromatography to provide analytically pure CCK 8.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to a process for the preparation of pep tides and pep tide amides which contain sulfated tyrosine and more specifically to the solid phase synthesis of cholecystokinin 26 33 , herein referred to asCCK 8, which has the following structure L Asp L Tyr SO3H L Met Gly L Trp L Met L Asp L Phe NH2 I Ondetti and Pluscec J. Am. Chem. Soc., 92, 195, 1970 J. Med. Chem., 13, 349 1970 see also U.S. Patent Nos.3,723,406 3,778,429 3,835,315 and 3,892,726 synthesizedCCR 8 and a series of analogs by the methods of solution phase peptide chemistry, and found that CCK 8 as well as some analogs have a considerably higher potency than the parent molecule, CCK 33. When administered in doses of ca. 10 6 mg kg, CCK 8 is a useful diagnostic agent for the examination of the contraction of the gall bladder and of pancreatic secretion cf. U.S. Patent No. 3,892,726 . Investigations have also revealed that CCK 8 exerts a strong releasing action on the muscle sphincter Oddii and thus, can be used with good results to alleviate the spasms occurring after gall bladder operations Ondetti, Rubin, and Engel, J. AmDigestive Diseases, 15, 149 1970 .More recent investigations have shown that CCK 8 exerts a strong anorectic effect Crawley, Rajas Ramirez, and Mendelson, Peptides, 3, 535 1982 and references therein . Ondetti and Pluscec see references above described a process for the preparation of CCK 8 from the protected octapeptide amide which was obtained from intermediate compounds prepared by the known methods of solution phase peptide chemistry. Overall yields reported for CCK 8 by these authors were in the tange of 1 2 based on the starting phenylalanine amide. By a somewhat modified procedure, Penke, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,102,878 described a process whereby CCK 8 was produced in 6.5 overall yield from phenylalanine amide by the known methods of solution phase peptide chemistry through an improved sulfation procedure.Sipos, U.S. Patent No, 3,714,140 discloses the solid phase synthesis of pep tides and gives as an example the synthesis of CCK 8. However, it is believed that CCK 8 cannot be synthesized by the Sipos method. For example, the cleavage reagent employed Example IB, HBr in trifluoroacetic acid dichloromethane generates C terminal pep tide acids notC terminal peptide amides as is CCK 8. In addition, no mention was made as to how the peptide was sulfated or when.A method for the solid phase synthesis of the C tetrminal fragments Asp Phe NH2 and Trp Met Asp Phe NH2 of CCK 8 has appeared Gaudreau, et al., In Peptides Synthesis Structure Function Rich and Gross, eds. , pp . 193 195,Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois, 1981 . Although the Gaudreau, et al., method does not describe the synthesis of CCK 8, it does point out some of the inherent problems associated with a synthesis of CCK 8 by the solid phase method.For example, when Boc Trp For Met Asp OPa Phe OCH2Resin, where Boc is tert butyloxycarbony1, For is formyl, andOPa is phenacyl ester, was treated successively with 0.1M hydrochloric acid in formic acid for Boc removal, 1M sodium thiophenoxide in DMF for OPa removal and 30 ammonia in methanol for For removal and ammonolysis of the peptide from the resin, the major product isolated 60 was not the desired product but Trp Met Asp Phe NH2 NH2 in which Phe NH2 had been transferred to the beta carboxyl of Asp while the alpha carboxyl of Asp had been amidated. The inventors, in an earlier attempt to develop a solid phase synthesis of unsulfated CCK 8, synthesized the peptide resin Boc Asp OtBu Tyr Met Gly Trp For Met Asp OCH2 PAM Resin Phe NH2 where OtBu is tert butyloxy and OCH2 P.EM is 4 oxymethyl phenylacetamidomethyl. The peptide was attached to the resin through the beta carboxyl of Asp. Treatment of the peptide resin with 50 trifluoroacetic acid in dichioromethane for Boc and OtBu removal and then with 10 equivalents of sodium hydroxide in 70 isopropanol for For removal and cleavage of the pep tide from the resin resulted in the generation of Asp Tyr Met Gly Trp Met Asp Phe NH2 OH while none of the desired product, Asp Tyr Met Gly Trp Met Asp Phe , was detected. Accordingly, heretoforer no definitive solid phase peptide synthesis of CCK 8 has been described. We have discovered process for the synthesis of pep tides and pep tide amides which provides higher overall yields, for example, 29 CCK 8 after purification to analytical purity in a single chromatographic step. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with this invention there is provided a process for the solid phase synthesis of pep tides which contain sulfated tyrosine comprising the steps of a preparing a peptidyl derivative of a resin selected from the group consisting of 4 X CH2 phenylacylamidomethyl polystyrenes and N,4 X CH2 phenylacylamidoalkylenepolyacrylamide, where X is halogen or hydroxyl, by the sequential addition of active esters of protected amino acids including tyrosine to an amino acid derivative of said resin, b reacting the hydroxyl group of tyrosine with a sulfating agent to provide a sulfate ester, and c separating the peptide from the resin by treating the peptidyl derivative with a nucleophile selected from the group consisting of alkalies, ammonia, amines, hydrazines and alkoxides. The peptide can be purified by ion exchange chromatography. DETAILED DESCRIPTION This invention provides a general process for the solidphase synthesis and purification of peptides and peptide amides containing sulfated tyrosine of which CCK 8 is one example. Other exampleS,include the gastrins G 14 II,G 17 II, and G 34 II , caerulein, phyllocaerulein and the cholecystokinins CCR 7, CCK 10, CCK 12, and CCK 33 . The choice of temporary protecting groups useful in the.solid phase synthesis of sulfated tyrosine containing peptides is dictated by the stability of the sulfate group to the various reagents required for removal of the temporary protecting groups during the synthesis. In this regard, peptides containing sulfated tyrosine are stable at pH 4, and as expected, exhibit poor stability in liquid HF. It is known, however, that CCK 8 is stable to brief treatment with trifluoroacetic acid TFA . The following structure depicts the protecting groups A,B, C, D, and E, to be used in the synthesis of CCR 8 EMI6.1 The properties of protecting group E must be such that a terminal anide linkage is generated upon its removal. In addition, group E must also serve as the solid support and be stable to the conditions required for the removal of groupsA, B, C, and D as well as conditions for the introduction of the sulfate ester moiety since it will be the last protecting group cleaved to release the product peptide amides. Peptide elides, of which CCK 8 is an example, are usually synthesized on a diarylmethylamine benzhydrylamine support.However, since these supports require liquid HF or similar strong acid treatment for cleavage of the pep tide amide from the support, the diarylmethylamine supports are not suitable for the synthesis due to the instability of sulfated pep tides to liquid HF. We have found that certain solid supports which allow nucleophilic cleavage of the peptide solid support anchor bond can be used. Of this type, the X CH2polystyrenes or N X alkylene polyacryl amides are preferred were X is halo or hydroxy. The polyacrylamide supports are less desirable due to their high cost and limited availability.Because Phe OCH2 polystyrene derived from or or EKK3f3 polystyrene due to steric and electronic factors is known to undergo ammonolytic cleavage only slowly and in low yield to produce Phe NH2, the X CH2 polystyrene S is halo or hydroxy supports require further alterations to be useful. The so called handle strategy is particularly useful for altering X CH2 polystyrene by the attachment of a handle or spacer linkage to produce a new solid support whose selective cleavage with nucleophiles, such as ammonia, provides a useful and high yield synthetic process for CCK 8.A number of handles are known in the art, however, we have found that 4 oxymethyl phenylacyl handles and more particularly the 4 oxymethyl phenylacetyl handle, are best suited for the solid phase synthesis of CCK 8. The term phenyl acryl also includes groups such as C6H4 CH2 2CO and C6H4 CO . The phenyl group can be further substituted with a nitro group. The 4 oxymethyl phenylacetyl handle when attached to Y CH2 polystyrene Y NH2 provides 4 oxymethyl phenylacetamidomethylpolystyrene herein referred to as OCH2 PAM Resin . The term polystyrene includes copolymers with minor amounts of other unsaturated monomers such as divinylbenzene. Peptidyl derivatives of the OCH2 PAM Resin, peptidyl OCH2 PAM Resin, can be cleaved by alkalies, ammonia or other amines, hydrazines, or alkoxides to yield respectively the peptide acid, amides, hydrazides, or esters.In addition, the peptidyl OCH2 PAM Resin is stable to trifluoroacetic acid TFA which is the preferred reagent for tert butyloxycarbonyl Boc and tert butyloxy OtBu protecting group removal and piperidine PIP which is the preferred reagent for 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl Fmoc protecting group removal.Thus, the CrCH2 PAH Resin group has the appropriate selectivity to be useful in a total solid phase synthesis of CCK 8 because it is also stable to the reagents required for the sulfation of tyrosine. Because CCK 8 contains theamino acids aspartic Asp , tyrosine Tyr , methionine Met , and tryptophan Trp , temporary protecting groups must be selected which minimize potential side reactions known to occur with these amino acids and which are removable under conditions whereby sulfated tyrosine and peptidyl OCH2 PAM Resin are stable.Accordingly, the Asp side chain carboxyl protecting groups B and D in structure II may be OtBu because this ester is removable, preferably with TFA, without side reactions. The selection of protecting group C in II depends on the choice for the temporary amino protecting group A. The Fmoc protecting group is best suited for group A since it is cleavable preferably with piperidine or other bases under conditions whereby the OtBu and OCH2 PAM Resin groups are stable. In addition, the selection of Fmoc for group A does not require the use of a Trp side chain protecting group group C , because Trp is stable under Fmoc removal conditions. Under certain conditions, temporary amino protection may be accomplished with the Boc group. However, due to the requirements of orthogonal protection, the Boc group can only be used in the terminal positions of CCK 8 since it cannot be selectively removed in the presence of theOtBu group. Otherwise, the Fmoc group is required for amino protection. Because the phenolic OH of tyrosine is to be sulfated after the incorporation of tyrosine into the peptide chain, temporary protection of the side chain of tyrosine is not required. However, the use of Tyr with an unprotected phenolic OH in peptide synthesis places special requirements on the coupling methods which may be used. The coupling method of choice in the synthesis of CCK 8 is the active ester method using active esters derived from 2 nitrophenol, 4 nitrophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide HOSu , l hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt , or others known in the art. Alternatively, the phenolic OH of tyrosine may be temporarily protected with the tBu group with Fmoc protection of the N terminal amino group and OtBu protection of the side chain of aspartic acid. Of the starting materials, namely, Boc Phe 4 oxymethyl phenylacetic acid, aminomethyl Resin, Fmoc Asp OtBu OH,Fmoc Met OH, Fmoc Trp OH, Fmoc Tyr tBu OH, Fmoc Gly OH, andBoc Asp OtBu OH are well known in the art. The starting material Fmoc Tyr OH may be prepared by reacting 9 fluorenylmethyl succinimidyl carbonate Fmoc OSu with tyrosine. The peptides of this invention may be prepared by the sequential addition of the appropriate amino acids one at a time to Boc Phe OCH PAM Resin following Boc removal.Such additions are accomplished for example, by activating the carboxylic acid group in the amino acid to be added after protecting the amino group in such amino acid, for example, by converting it to its Fmoc or Boc derivative, converting this deriviative into, for example, an HOBt ester prepared in situ and then reacting this active ester with the Phe OCH P Resin or peptidyl OCH2 PAM Resin. Various methods of removing the protecting groups Boc,Fmoc, OtBu, and OCH2 PAn Resin from the peptide are known in the art. The Boc group may be removed by acid treatment, as by TFA. The Fioc group may be removed by base treatment, as by piperidine. However, the base selected to remove the Fmoc group mist be sufficiently mild as to not cause premature cleavage of the OCH2 PAM Resin group. The OtBu group may be removed by acid treatment, as by TFA, but not before the sulfation step since acid treatment also removes theN terminal Boc group which must be present during the sulfation of the tyrosine hydroxyl group. Preferably, theN terminal amino group may be protected with the Fmoc group which allows removal of the OtBu group prior to sulfation resulting in a process which does not require any acid treatment steps after sulfation which steps can reduce yields due to the instability of the sulfate ester in the acids used for protective group removal. The sulfation of tyrosine in the protected peptidyl OCH2PAM Resin of this invention may be achieved by the reaction of the protected peptidyl OCH2 PAM Resin with sulfur trioxide pyridine complexes and other sulfur trioxide tertiary amine complexes, or similar sulfating agents such as pyridinium acetylsulfate, f or from 4 to 21 hours at room temperature with excess reagent being filtered off. Finally, after removal of the Fmoc or Boc and OtBu groups, the Terminal protecting group OCH2 PAM Resin may be removed by treatment of the peptide Resin with an ammoniacal solution, as by ammonia in methanol, to produce the peptide amide. The peptides of this invention may be purified to analytical purity by a single pass down a column containing an ion exchange resin such as DEAE Trisacryl M LKBInstruments. Inc. or a similar ion exchange resin. The DEAE Trisacryl ion exchange gel i s an acrylamide copolymer of N Tris hydroxymethyl methyl acrylamide and N 2 diethylamino ethyl acrylamide. Examples of other ion exchange resins are polysaccharide copolymers such as diethylaminoethyl cellulose and diethylaminoethyl dextran. The invention will be further illustrated in the following examples. All temperatures are in degrees centigrade unless otherwise stated.
