# Method of manufacturing compound semiconductor apparatus.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a compound semiconductor device has the steps of mirror polishing a surface of each of two compound semiconductor substrates 11, 12 , bringing the mirror polished surfaces of the two compound semicon ductor substrates 11, 12 in contact with each other in a clean atmosphere and in a state wherein substantially no foreign substances are present therebetween, and annealing the compound semiconductor substrates 11, 12 which are in contact with each other so as to provide a bonded structure having a junction with excellent electrical charac teristics at the interface.
