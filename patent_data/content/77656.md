# Plate type heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger comprises plates 10 of identical configuration formed of relatively thin material and assem bled in stacked construction pairs 60, with alternating patterns of different corrugations 36,38 being provided between spaced openings 20,22 in each plate 10. Alternate plates in each stack provide corrugation patterns with transverse relationship assure turbulence inducing structure in both primary 16 and secondary 18 flow passages. Pairs of plates 60 are formed by assembling the identical plates 10 in back to back relationship to form a construction pair 60, with the pairs 60 of plates 10 being secured together by sealing only two surfaces 50,52 of substantially uniform thickness of plate. The construction of the stack 12 of plates is accom plished without necessity for provision of tubular inlet and outlet channels extending through the stack structure. The plates 10 being of identical configuration and construction, reduce the number of hydroform punch and dies required, facilitate continuous flow production, minimize tooling die upkeep, and minimize production halts due to die tempera ture dimension changes. The heat exchanger finds particular application in the regenerator of a gas turbine engine.
