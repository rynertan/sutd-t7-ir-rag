# Bio compatible and blood compatible materials and methods.

## Abstract
Bio and blood compatible materials are prepared by treating the surface of a substrate to provide reactive primary or secondary amine group sites which are activated by treatment with a dialdehyde or arylchloride for coupling to a biological in an amount sufficient to provide compatibility. The use of specific substrates, such as a compliant, and elastic material, such as a fabric elastomer membrane matrix, results in a product having advantageous qualities as breast prostheses and implants. Detailed procedures and various products are described.
