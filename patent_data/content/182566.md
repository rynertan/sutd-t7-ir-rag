# Method for processing lightsensitive silver halide color photographic material.

## Abstract
In a method of processing a lightsensitive silver halide col or photographic material comprising subjecting a lightsensitive silver halide color photographic material comprising a blue sen sitive silver halide emulsion layer, a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and a red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer provided on a base, the blue sensitive silver halide emul sion layer containing a high speed reactive yellow coupler hav ing a relative coupling reaction rate of not less than 0.3, to color development, followed by processing with a processing solu tion having a fixing ability and then processing with a stabiliz ing solution without involving any substantial washing step, the improvement wherein the stabilizing solution contains a sulfite with at least 1 x 10 Â³ mole per 1 liter of the stabilizing solution. According to the processing method, a dye image having a superior stability with a lapse of time can be obtained.
