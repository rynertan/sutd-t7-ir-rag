# Multiprocessor multisystem communications network.

## Abstract
A plurality of multiprocessor systems a, b. . .n is ar ranged in a high speed network to allow any processor 10 in one system to communicate with any processor 10 in another system. The network may be configured as a multi node dual bidirectional ring having a multiprocessor sys tem at each node 18, 20 . Packets of information can be passed around the ring in either of two directions and are temporarily stored in buffer memory locations dedicated to a selected destination processor 10 in a selected direction between each successive transfer between neighbouring nodes 18, 20 . The buffer locations are managed so that a node 18, 20 can request an adjacent node 18, 20 to stop transmitting packets if the buffer is becoming full from that direction and request resumption of transmission of packets as the buffer empties.
