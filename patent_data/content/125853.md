# Solar radiation collector.

## Abstract
A solar radiation collector comprises a receiver 2 5 through which passes a medium to be heated by solar radia tion, and a concentrator 2 1, 2 4 for concentrating solar radi ation onto the receiver 2 5 . The receiver 2 5 is an elongate structure of polygonal or approximately polygonal section, and the concentrator may be a Fresnel lens system 2 1 and cycloidal mirrors 214 . Between the concentrator 2 1, 2 4 and the receiver 2 5 is an intermediate device 2 6 surround ing the receiver 2 5 for reducing energy losses due to radia tion emitted by the receiver 2 5 . The intermediate device 2 6 has a reflective, internal surface 1 3, 1 5, 1 6 for reflect ing back onto the receiver 2 5 radiation emitted therefrom, and at least one window 1 4, 1 7 in its perimeter through which radiation is focussed onto the receiver 2 5 by the concentrator 2 1, 2 4 . The internal surface of the intermedi ate device 2 6 , when viewed in section is constituted by curved arcs such as to concentrate onto the receiver 2 5 radiation emitted therefrom. Preferably the arcs of the inter mediate device 2 6 are elliptical. Also preferably the external surface of the receiver 1 9 , when viewed in section, has at least one of its faces 16 1 constituted by a curved surface. In some forms, the concentrator has instead of a Fresnel lens 2 1 a parabolic mirror 32 1 and a plane mirror 32 2 which is automatically moveable to focus the solar radiation from the parabolic mirror 32 1 onto the receiver 31 3 .
