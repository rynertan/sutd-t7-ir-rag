# Microprocessor controlled multiple servo system for a recording and or reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
The system controls all servo systems for a magnetic tape recording and reproducing apparatus, including a capstan servo 34 , a reel servo 32 , a scanning drum servo 36 and an automatic scan tracking servo 44 which controls the position of reproduce heads carried by the scanning drum which are of the type which can be transversely moved relative to the longitudinal direction of recorded tracks so as to accurately follow the tracks during special effect reproduc ing modes, such as slow motion, stop motion and fast motion reproducing. The microprocessor 30 controls all of the servos in a way which permits interaction between the various servo systems and enables more accurate and powerful functional operation of the entire apparatus.
