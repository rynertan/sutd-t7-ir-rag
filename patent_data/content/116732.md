## Description
SHAPE SELECTIVE METALLIC CATALYSIS This invention relates to a novel shape selective metal catalyst, a method of preparing same and its employment in various catalytic processes. Shape selective catalysis utilizing molecular sieves was first demonstrated by P. B. Weisz and V. J. Frilette in J. Phys. Chem.64, p. 302 to960 . Since then, the shape selective catalytic properties of various zeolites have been extensively demonstrated.For example, N.Y. Chen and W. E. Garwood in Some Catalytic Properties of ZSM 5, a New Shape Selective Zeolite , Journal of Catalysis, 52, p.453 458 1978 described the shape selectivity of ZSM 5. On the other hand, the use of zeolites as shape selective supports for catalytic functions has received much less attention. P. B. Weisz, V. J. Frilette, R. W. Maatman and F. B.

An excellent summary of the art of metal loaded zeolite catalysts and shape selective catalysis is given in Zeolite Chemistry and Catalysts, J. A. Rabo, ed., ACS Monograph 171 1976 . Of particular interest is Chapter 10, Catalytic Properties ofMetal Containing Zeolites by K. M. Minachev and Y. I. Isakov andChapter 12, Shape Selective Catalysis by S. M. Csicsery. Heretofore, a shape selective metallic catalyst has not been prepared in which one metal function is incorporated into a zeolite characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and aConstraint Index C. I. , as hereinafter defined, in the approximate range of 1 to 12, e.g., ZSM 5 zeolite. In accordance with the present invention, there is now provided a novel shape selective metal catalyst and a method to prepare same. Shape selectivity is imparted to such metal catalyst components as platinum, palladium and nickel, etc. via utilization of members of a particular class of zeolites and by novel reduction techniques. Said class of zeolites is characterized by a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a Constraint Index in the approximate range of 1 to 12. The preparation of the novel shape selective metal catalyst is accomplished by incorporating the metal catalyst component into a member of the aforesaid particular class of zeolites C.I. 1 12 SiO2 A1203 at least 12 and by then reducing the metal loaded zeolite at elevated temperatures 1000C 5000C in the presence of one or more unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds and with or without hydrogen. It will be appreciated that reduction of such metal catalysts is required to activate them. The prior art taught such reduction only in a hydrogen atmosphere or reduction using oxygen followed by hydrogen. Reduction in hydrogen alone, without added unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins, will result in an active, but non shape selective catalyst.The preferred metal catalyst components useful herein are selected from the Group VIII metals in the Periodic Table including platinum, palladium and nickel, with platinum particularly preferred. The shape selective metal containing catalysts prepared in accordance with the present invention have selectivity values greater than 2.0 for the selective hydrogenation of hexene l over 4,4 dimethylhexene l. The present invention. also relates to a process for conversion of a feedstock comprising organic compounds by contacting the feedsock under conversion conditions with the novel shape.selective catalysts described hereinbefore. Organic compounds in such feedstocks can comprise alkenes, dienes, polyenes, alkynes, cycles, aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, alkylaromatic hydrocarbon compounds or paraffins. The crystalline zeolites utilized in the particular embodiment members of a specific class of zeolite materials which exhibit unusual properties. Although these zeolites have unusually low alumina contents, i.e. high silica to alumina. mole ratios, they are very active for many reactions, e.g. cracking, even when the silica to alumina mole ratio exceeds 30. The activity is surprising since catalytic activity is generally attributed to framework aluminum atoms and or cations associated with these aluminum atoms. These zeolites retain their crystallinity for long periods in spite of the presence of steam at high temperature which induces irreversible collapse of the framework of other zeolites, e.g. of the X and A type. Furthermore, carbonaceous deposits, when formed, maybe removed by burning at higher than usual temperatures to restore activity.These zeolites, used as catalysts, generally have low coke forming activity and therefore are conducive to long times on stream between regenerations by burning carbonaceous deposits with oxygen containing gas such as air. An important characteristic of the crystal structure of this particular class of zeolites is that it provides a selective constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small pore Linde A and the large pore Linde X, i.e. the pore windows of the structure are of about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of silicon atoms interconnected by oxygen atoms.It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum, or possibly other elements atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra. It should be understood that the zeolites of the present invention are not limited to those which contain both silicon and aluminum. For the purpose of this invention, the term zeolite is meant to represent the class of porotectosilicates, i.e., porous crystalline silicates that contain silicon and oxygen atoms as the major components. Other components may be present in minor amounts, usually less than 14 mole and preferably less than 4 mole . These components include aluminum, gallium, iron, boron and the iike with aluminum being preferred and used herein for illustration purposes.The minor components may be present separately or in mixtures. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolite with a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred in some instances to use zeolites having much higher silica to alumina mole ratios. Thus zeolites useful in the present invention can have silica to alumina molar ratios of at least 70, or in some instances at least 300 or even at least 500. In addition, zeolites as otherwise characterized herein but which are substantially free of aluminum, i.e. having silica to alumina mole ratios up to and including infinity, are found to be useful and even preferable in some instances. Such high silica zeolites are intended to be included within this description. The particular class of zeolites, after activation, acquire an intra crystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e. they exhibit hydrophobic properties. The particular class of zeolites useful herein have an effective pore size such as to freely sorb normal hexane. In addition, the structure must provide constrained access to larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of silicon and aluminum atoms, then access by molecules of larger cross section than normal hexane is excluded and the zeolite is not of the desired type. Windows of l0 membered rings are preferred, although in some instances excessive puckering of the rings or pore blockage may render these zeolites ineffective. Although 12 membered rings in theory would not offer sufficient constraint to produce advantageous conversions, it is noted that the puckered 12 ring structure of TMA offretite does show some constrained access. Other 12 ring structures may exist which may be operative for other reasons, and therefore, it is not the present intention to entirely judge the usefulness of a particular zeolite solely from theoretical structural considerations. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules of larger cross section than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index as herein defined may be made by passing continuously a mixture of an equal weight of normal hexane and 3 methylpentane over a sample of zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedure. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube. Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at 5400C lOOs0F for at least 15 minutes.The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature is adjusted between 2900C 5550F and 5100C 9500F to give an overall conversion of between 10 and 60 . The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at 1 liquid hourly space velocity i.e. 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of zeolite per hour over the the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to total hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4 1. After 20 minutes on stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons. While the above experimental procedure will enable one to achieve the desires overall conversion of 10 to 60 for most zeolite samples and represents preferred conditions, it may occasionally be necessary to use somewhat more severe conditions for samples of vey low activity, such as those having an exceptionally high silica to alumina mole ratio. In those instances, a temperature of up to about 540 C 1005 F and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of less than one, such as 0.1 or less, can be employed In order to achieve a minimum total conversion of bout 10 . There also may be instances where the activity is so low i.e. silica to alumina mole ratio approaching infinity that theConstraint Index cannot be adequately measured, if at all. In such situations, Constraint Index is meant to mean the Constaint Index of the exact same substance i. e. same crystal structure as determined by such means as X ray diffraction pattern but in a measureable form i.e. aluminum containing form . The Constraint index is calculated as follows Constraint Index loo 10 fraction of hexane remainina log l0 fraction of 3 methylpentane remaining The Constraint index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constants for the two hydfocarbons. Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a Constraint index in the appropriate range of 1 to i2. Constraint Index CI values for some typcial materials are C.I. ZSM 4 0.5 ZSM 5 8.3 ZSM ll 8.7 ZSM 12 2 ZSM 23 9.1 ZSM 35 4.5 ZSM 38 2 TMA Offretite 3.7 Clinoptilolite 3.4 Beta 1.5 H Zeolon mordenite 0.4 REY 0.4 Amorphous Silica Alumina 0.6 Erionite 38 The above described Constraint Index is an important and even critical deflnition of those zeolites which are useful in the instant invention. The very nature of this parameter and the recited technique by which it is determined, however, admit of the possibility that a given zeolite can be tested under somewhat different conditions and thereby exhibit different Constraint Indices. Constraint Index seems to vary somewhat with severity of operation conversion and the presence or absence of binders. Likewise, other variables such as crystal size of the zeolite, the presence of occluded contaminants, etc., may affect the Constraint Index.Therefore, it will be appreciated that it may be possible to so select test conditions as to establish more than one value in the approximate range of 1 to 12 for the Constraint Index of a particular zeolite. Such a zeolite exhibits the constrained access as herein defined and is to be regarded as having a Constraint Index in the approximate range of 1 to 12. Also contemplated herein as having a Constraint Index in the approximate range of 1 to 12 therefore within the scope of the defined novel class of highly siliceous zeolites are those zeolites which, when tested under two or more sets of conditions within the above specified ranges of temperature and conversion, produce a value of the Constraint Index slightly less than 1, e.g. 0.9, or somewhat greater than 12, e.g. 14 or 15, with at least one other value within the range of 1 to 12.Thus, it should be understood that the Constraint Index value as used herein is an inclusive rather than an exclusive value. That is, a crystalline zeolite when identified by any combination of conditions within the testing definition set forth herein as having a ConstraintIndex in the approximate range of 1 to 12 is intended to be included in the instant zeolite definition whether or not the same identical zeolite, when tested under other of the find conditions, may give aConstraint Index value outside of the approximate range of 1 to 12. The particular class of zeolites defined herein is exemplified by ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 5 ZSM 11 intermediate, ZSM 12,ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48, zeolite beta and other similar materials. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patents No. 3,702,886 and Re. No. 29.949. Such descriptions include the X ray diffraction pattern of the therein disclosed ZSM 5. ZSM 11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979. That description also includes the partIcular the X ray diffraction pattern of said ZSM 11. ZSM 5 ZSM 11 intermediate is described In U.S. Patent No.4,229,424. ZSM 12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449. That description also Includes the particular the X ray diffraction pattern of said ZSM 12. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842 which includes the specification of the X ray diffraction pattern of the disclosed zeolite. ZSM 35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245 which includes the X ray diffraction pattern thereof. ZSM 38 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,859 which includes the X ray diffraction pattern of said ZSM 38. ZSM 48 is described in U. S. Patent Application Serial No.343,131, filed January 27, 1982 which includes the X ray diffraction pattern of said ZSM 48. It is to be understood that by citing the foregoing patents as describing examples of specific members of the zeolite class with greater particularity, it is intended that identification of the therein disclosed crystalline zeolites be resolved on the basis of their respective X ray diffraction patterns. As discussed above, the present invention contemplates utilization of such catalyts wherein the mole ratio of silica to alumina is essentially unbounded. The citation of the identified patents should therefore not be construed as limiting the disclosed crystalline zeolites to those having the specific silica alumina mole ratios discussed therein, it now being known that such zeolites may be substantially aluminum free and yet, having the same crystal structure as the disclosed materials, may be useful or even preferred in some applications.It is the crystal structure, as identified by the X ray diffraction fingerprint , which establishes the identity of the specific crystalline zeolite material. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are unsuitable for use herein, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be made suitable by heating in an inert atmosphere at 5400C 10050F for one hour. If desired, these zeolites may then be ion exchanged with suitable compounds, e.g.salts, to get desired cationic form, e.g. sodium, hydrogen, ammonium, etc. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolite structures of the class herein identified by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandlte, and clinoptilolite. The preferred crystalline zeolites for utilization herein include ZSM 5, ZSM ll, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48, and zeolite beta with ZSM 5, ZSM ll, and zeolite beta being particularly preferred. The crystalline zeolites of the present invention generally have a minimum crystal dimension of about 0.01 micron. Preferably, however, zeolites with a crystal dimension of greater than about 0.1 micron are employed. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites hereof are selected as those providing, among other things, a crystal framework density in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. It has been found that zeolites which satisfy all three of the discussed criteria are most desired for several reasons. Therefore, the preferred zeolites useful with respect to this invention are those having a Constraint Index as defined above of about 1 to about 12, a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a dried crystal density of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubic Angstoms, as given, e.g., on Page 19 of the article ZEOLITE STRUCTURE by W.M. Meier.This paper is included in PROCEEOINGS OF THE CONFERENCE ON MOLECULAR SIEVES, London, April 1967 published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968. When the crystal structure is unknown, the crystal framework density may be determined by classical pyknometer techiques. For example, it may be determined by immersing the dry hydrogen form of the zeolite in an organic solvent which is not sorbed by the crystal.Or, the crystal density may be determined by mercury porosimetry, since mercury will fill the interstices between crystals but will not penetrate the intracrystalline free space. It is possible that the unusual sustained activity and stability of this special class of zeolites is associated with its high crystal anionic framework density of not less than about 1 .6 grams per cubic centimeter. This high density must necessarily be associated with a relatively small amount of free space within the crystal, which might be expected to result in more stable structures.This free space, however, is important as the focus of catalytic activity. Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites, including some which are not within the purview of this invention are Void Framework Volume DensityFerrierite 0.28 cc cc 1.76 g cc Mordenite .28 1.7 ZSM 5, 11 .29 1.79ZSM 12 1.8ZSM 23 2.0Dachiardite .32 1.72L .32 1.61Clinoptilolite .34 1.71Laumontite .34 1.77ZSM 4 Omega .38 1.65Heulandite .39 1.69P .41 1.57Offretite .40 1.55Levynite .40 1.54Erionite .35 1.51Gmelinite .44 1.46Chabazite .4i 1.45A .5 1.3Y .48 1.27 When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite can be conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form.In addition to the hydrogen form, other forms of the zeolite can be employed so long as the original alkali metal has been reduced to less than about 50 percent by weight of the original alkali metal contained in the zeolite as synthesized, usually 0.5 percent by weight or less.Thus, the original alkali metal of the zeolite may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable metal cations of Groups I through VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, calcium or rare earth metals. The incorporation of the metallic catalyst component into the particular type of zeolite of this invention can be accomplished by any suitable means such as ion exchange. In some instances this ion exchange may prove difficult, in which case it may be desirable to form a complex of the metal before attempting the exchange. A particularly preferred method to ion exchange platinum and palladium metals into the zeolites of this invention is to employ an ammine complex of such metals. Such complex can be formed by first dissolving the metal in an acid, e.g. aqua regia, and then adding an amine such as ammonium hydroxide, i.e. ammonia solution, until the entire solution becomes basic. Alternatively, a salt of the metal, e.g. platinum chloride, can be contacted with amine solution, e.g. ammonia solution, until basic. The weight ratio of metallic catalyst component to zeolite is not critical, however, it is desirable to have a weight ratio in the range of between about 0.01 and about 10 and preferably between about 0.256 and about 5 . Alternatively, the metallic catalyst component can be incorporated into the zeolite by impregnating the zeolite with a solution of the metal or metal compounds or complexes, followed by stripping of the solvent employed. Metallic component incorporation can also be accomplished by sorbing metal compounds or complexes into the zeolite. Thus, such materials as nickel carbonyl or rhodium carbonyl chloride can be sorbed from solution or from the gas phase into the zeolite structure. Once the metal loaded zeolite catalyst is prepared , the catalyst is activated by reduction with unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds at a temperature of between about 1000C 2100F and about 5000C 9300F and preferably between about 150 C 3000F and about 4500C 8400F .. The unsaturated hydrocarbons must be maintained throughout the reduction at a concentration of between about 1 and about 100 and more preferably between about 10 and about 50 . Once reduction is complete, there is no longer a need for the presence of the unsaturated hydrocarbons.It is preferred that such reduction be conducted in e hydrogen atmosphere, however, the reduction can occur in the absence of hydrogen, e.g. olefin only, or olefin and inert gas e.g., nitrogen . In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a very stable catalyst can be achieved by back exchanging a bulky ion onto said catalyst prior to the aforementioned reduction. Non limiting examples of such bulky ions include cesium and potassium. The resultant catalyst of the method of this ivention can be utilized in any process or combination of processes which employs metal catalyst components such as platinum, palladium, nickel and combinations thereof. Examples of such processes include hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, isomerization, cracking, dewaxing, reforming, conversion of alkylaromatics, oxidation, etc. It is noted that the particular advantage of the novel catalyst prepared by the method of this invention is its ability to catalyze specific reactions shape selectively. For example, by utilizing a platinum or palladium version of the catalyst of the instant invention straight chain olefins will be sel ectively hydrogenated over branched chain olefins. The resultant catalyst also exhibits very good stability in the presence of poisons, e.g. sulfur, phosphorus, as well as having enhanced high temperature activity seeTable 3 hereinbelow . It is also postulated that the catalyst produced by the novel method of this invention would be less susceptible to coking.Thus the resultant catalyst would also be applicable in metal catalyzed reactions in which shape selectivity is not per se crucial, e.g., oxidation, reforming, synthesis gas conversion, hydroformylation, dimerization, polymerization, alcohol conversion, etc. Catalytic conversion conditions for hydrogenation of such feedstocks as alkenes, dienes, polyenes, alkynes, cyclenes, aromatics, oxygenates, etc. include a temperature of between about 2Q 40F and about 5400C 10050F , preferably between about 250C 770F and 3100C 5900F , a pressure of between about 100 kPa 0 psig and about 7800 kPa 1000 psig , preferably between about 100 kPa 0 psig and 1480 kPa 200 psig , a hydrogen feed mole ratio of between about 0.1 and 20, preferably between about 4 and 12 and a LHSV of between about 0.1 and 100, preferably between about 0.5 and 4. Dehydrogenation conditions, for example for conversion of paraffins to the corresponding olefins or ethyl benzene to styrene, optionally in the presence of steam or inert gases such as nitrogen, include temperatures of from about 2000C 3920F to 10000C 18320F , preferably from about 3500C 6620F to 6000C 11120F feedstock partial pressures of from about 10 kPa 1.5 psia to 10,000 kPa 1470 psia , preferably from about 10 kPa 1.5 psia to 100 kPa 14.7 psia and a LHSV of from about 0.1 to 100, preferably between about 0.5 and 4. Dehydrocyclization conditions, for example for conversion of paraffins to aromatics e.g. octane to ethylbenzene or xylene , also include temperatures of from about 2000C 3920F to 10000C 18320F , preferably from about 3500C 6620F to 6000C 11120F feedstock partial pressures of from about 10 kPa 1.5 psia to 10,000 kPa 1470 psia , preferably from about 10 kPa 1.5 psia to 100 kPa 14.7 psia and a LHSV of from about 0.1 to 100, preferably between about 0.5 and 4. Isomerization, with or without hydrogen, such as isomerization of normal paraffins, is conducted at a temperature of between about 1000C 2120F and 5000C 932 F , preferably between about 1500C 3000F and 2900C 55O0F , a LHSV of between about 0.01 and 50, preferably between about 0.25 and 5 and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of between 0 and 5 1. Catalytic conversion conditions for cracking, with or without hydrogen, include a temperature of between about 2000C 4000F and about 5000C 9320F , a pressure of between about 170 kPa 10 psig and about 17,600 kPa 2500 psig , a hydrogen feed mole ratio of between about 0 and about 80 and a LHSV of between about 0.1 and about 10. The shape selective catalysts of. the present invention are also useful in dewaxing operations and can likewise be employed as reforming catalysts or as part of a reforming catalyst. Dewaxing and reforming can be carried out in the presence or absence of hydrogen under conditions which include a.temperature of from abou t 2500C 4820F to 6000C 11120F , preferably from about 4000C 7520F to 5000C 9320F a pressure of from about lOkPa 1.5 psia to 10,000 kPa 1470 psia and a WHSV of from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably from about 0.1 to 10. Catalytic conversion conditions for conversion of alkylaromatics including dealkylation or hydroisomerization, particularly xylene isomerization and hydroisomerization of ethylbenzene to xylene, include a temperature of between about 2600C 500 F and about 6000C 11120F , preferably between about 3200C 6000F and 5000C 9320F , a pressure of between about 240 kPa 20 psig and about 7000 kPa 1000 psig , preferably between about 275 kPa 25 psig and about 2860 kPa 400 psig , a hydrogen feed mole ratio of between about 1 and 20, preferably between about 2 and about 8 and aWHSV of between about 1 and 50, preferably between about 5 and 15. The metal containing catalysts of the present invention can also be advantageously employed under oxidation reaction conditions as oxidation or combustion catalysts. Thus, the novel catalysts of the present invention can be employed for oxidation reactions such as oxidation or combustion of paraffins, olefins and alkylaromatics and in processes involving reaction of CO and H2 methanol synthesis, Fiscer Tropsch process, etc. wherein shape selectivity is not necessarily essential. Such catalysts can also shape selectively catalyze oxidation reactions such as, for example, the selective oxidation of p xylene relative to o xylene. The metal containing catalyst produced according to the method of the instant invention represents a novel catalyst composite. The catalyst of this invention differs from prior art catalysts in that the instant catalyst is shape selective. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operability, it is believed that the shape selectivity of the present catalyst is due to the position of the metal function 1inside rather than outside the zeolite with the metal function having a valence of zero rather than having a positive valence .In the case of a Pt ZSM 5 catalyst composite, prior art techniques involving ion exchange would result inPt 2 being inside the zeolite, not Pto. Upon reduction, the pt 2 would migrate to the surface and form PtO. Thus prior art techniques would result in either Pt 2 inside the zeolite or Pto on the surface of the zeolite, but not PtO inside, i.e. in the interstices of the zeolite. The shape selective metal catalyst of the present invention is characterized as having a selectivity of greater than 2.0 for the selective hydrogenation of a linear olefin, e.g. hexene l, over a dimethyl branched olefin, e.g., 4,4 dimethylhexene l. Such selectivity can be determined in a standard competitive olefin hydrogenation test. In such a test, a 1 1 molar mixture of the straight and branched chain olefins and hydrogen are passed through a down flow fixed bed glass reactor containing from about 5 mg to 30 mg, e.g. 15 mg, of the catalyst being tested after ammonia injection to supress acidity. Using a 5 fold excess of hydrogen over olefin, hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature of from about 2000C 3920F to 4800C 8950F , e.g. about 30O0C 5750F , using a WHSV of from about 5 to 100, e.g. 25.Percent hydrogenation of each of the two olefins is measured and selectivity is calculated according to the following equation based on the percentage of each olefin left unconverted to the hydrogenation product. Selectivity ln Branched Olefin Unconverted in Linear Olefin Unconverted As noted hereinbefore, shape selective characteristics can be imparted to the metal containing catalysts of the present invention by reducing a metal containing zeolite in the presence of one or more unsaturated compounds. The shape selectivity of such catalysts metals can be increased even further by means of several additional zeolite treatment operations. Selectivity can be increased, for example, by increasing the temperature of the shape selective conversion reactions, e.g. hydrogenation, being carried out.Shape selectivity of the catalysts of the present invention can also be increased by selectively poisoning the catalyst with a bulky poison such as trip tolylphosphine. Such bulky poisons deactivate the metallic catalyst component on the outside of catalyst composite to a greater extent than they poison the metal function in the interstices of the composite. The following examples will serve to illustrate the invention without limiting same. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of NH4 ZSM 5 4 zeolite with a crystal size of about 1 to 2 microns. A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 16 parts water and 27.7 parts sodium silicate 28.7 wt Si02, 8.9 wt Na20, 62.4 H20 followed by addition of 0.08 parts Daxad 27 W.R. GraceChem. Co. The solution was cooled to approximately 150C. An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminum sulfate 17.2 wt A1203 to 16.4 parts water followed by 2.4 parts sulfuric acid 93 wt H2S04 and 1.2 parts NaCl. These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel while 3.9 parts of NaCl were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following SiO2 A12O3 78.4 2 0 49.9 23 An organic solution was prepared by adding 1.6 parts n propyl bromide and 3.1 parts methyl ethyl ketone to 1.9 parts tri n propylamine and added to the gel. The mixture was reacted at 650 700C 150 1600F with severe agitation for 29 hours. The zeolite slurry product was diluted with 4 5 parts water per part slurry and 0.002 parts of flocculent Rohm Haas PrimaflocC 7 per part slurry, allowed to settle and supernatant liquid was drawn off. The settled solids were reslurried to the original volume of the preceding step with water and 0.00005 parts of flocculent per part slurry After settling, the aqueous phase was decanted. This procedure was repeated until the decant supernatant liquid was Cl free. The washed zeolite was then filtered, dried and identified asZSM 5 having a silica alumina mole ratio of about 70, and a ConstraintIndex of about 8.3. The ammonium form of the zeolite was obtained by calcination and NH4NO3 exchange. EXAMPLE 2 A sample of Pt ZSM 5 catalyst was prepared by exchanging N.H4 ZSM 5, prepared according to Example 1, containing 0.354 meqN gram zeolite, with CsCl. The resultant Cs ZSM 5 analyzed for only 0.013 residual meq N g. 4 grams of this Cs ZSM 5 was mixed with 1.25 g Pt NH3 4C12H20 dissolved in 50 ml water and stirred for four hours at room temperature. Titration of the effluent gases produced in the thermal gravimetric analysis of this material in hydrogen indicated the presence of 0.618 meq N g, which is equivalent to 88X exchange with Pt NH3 4 ions. EXAMPLE 3 1 g of the catalyst material from Example 2 was back exchanged with an equal weight of CsCl dissolved in 20 ml of water. The resultant material analyzed for only 0.216 meq N g. The resultant catalyst was Cs Pt ZSM 5 with the platinum content reduced to one third of the original amount. The percentage of platinum in the catalyst was 1.0 wt. . EXAMPLES 4 7 The Cs Pt ZSM 5 catalyst prepared according to Example 3 was used in conjunction with a down flow fixed bed glass reactor to conduct competitive hydrogenation reactions. The reactor was connected to an on line gas chromatograph, containing a 12 foot n octane Durapak column. To reduce the amount of cracking observed, a few cc of ammonia gas was injected prior to actual sampling. The amount of catalyst used ranged from between about 5 and 30 mg dispersed in 2 cc of vycor. The catalyst was activated in the reactor itself prior to use by reduction in a hydrogen stream, either in the presence or absence of added olefin at a temperature in the range of between about 3000C 570oF and 4800C 8950F . The olefins were fed into the reactor by means of a syringe pump and diluted with a flow of hydrogen. Typical operating conditions included a hydrogen flow of 14cc min. and a liquid feed olefin rate of l.Occ hr., which represented a 5 fold excess of hydrogen over olefin. When an olefin was used during reduction, an equimolar solution bf two olefins were fed into the reactor. Examples 4 7 illustrate the effects of catalyst pretreatment on hydrogenation selectivity. The results for Examples 4 7 are given in Table 1. In Example 4, the catalyst was pretreated with only hydrogen at 3000C 5700F for 1 hour. The resultant catalyst was not selective in that only a 29 hydrogenation of the linear olefin hexene 1 was obtained with a 39 hydrogenation of the branched olefin 4,4 dimethyl hexene 1 . The catalyst in Example 5 pretreated with both hydrogen and olefin at 2750C 5250F for one hour. This catalyst exhibited very good shape selectivity with a 9aS hydrogenation of the linear olefin and less than a 1 hydrogenation of the branched olefin. In Example 6, catalyst pretreatment involved contact with only olefins, no hydrogen, at 3000C 5700F , for 1 hour. The resultant catalyst exhibited some shape selectivity, but not as much as with the dual hydrogen olefin pretreatment of Example 5. The catalyst of Example 6 was further treated in Example 7 with both olefins and hydrogen at 4ûO C 75O0F for 17 hours. The result of pretreatment at this elevated temperature was that a very shape selective catalyst was produced, i.e. 100 hydrogenation of the linear olefin as compared to a 1.3 hydrogenation of the branched olefin.

Hydrogenation reactions were run in Examples 8 to 14 using the same equipment and experimental procedure of Examples 4 5. The results for these examples is given in Table 2.As shown by Table 2, the cesium containing catalyst was more stable than the catalyst which did not contain cesium.

The non selective catalyst was prepared with pretreatment with hydrogen only at 300 C 5700F , while the shape selective catalyst was pretreated in the presence of an added olefin. Hydrogenation reactions were run in Examples 15 and 16 using the same equipment and experimental procedure of Examples 4 and 5. As shown in Table 3, the non selective catalyst of Example 15 exhibited decreasing conversions of the linear olefin hexene at higher temperatures. In contrast, the activity and selectivity of the shape selective catalyst of Example 16 increased with increasing temperature as shown by the increase in conversion of the linear olefin hexene .

The catalyst was pretreated at 4000C 7500F in the presence of this olefin mixture and hydrogen. The results of this example were that selective conversion of pentene l 97 hydrogenated relative to 4,4 dimethylpentene 1 1.7 hydrogenation was observed. EXAMPLES 18 19 Examples 18 19 illustrate the hydrogenation of styrenes. InExample 18, a 0.5 platinum on alumina catalyst obtained fromEngelhard Co. was utilized.. This catalyst exhibited no shape selectivity in that the precent hydrogenation of styrene and 2 methyl styrene were almost equal. In Example 19, the catalyst utilized was the same catalyst as used previously in Example 17. The pretreatment for both the catalysts in Examples 18 and 19 were exactly the same olefins and hydrogen with heating to 4000C 750 F . The results ofExample 19, as shown in Table 4, show that this catalyst is selective in that the linear styrene was 50 hydrogenated, while the non linear, 2 methylstyrene was only 1.8 hydrogenated.

An organics salt solution was prepared by mixing 1.6 parts of n propyl bromide, 1.9 parts of tri n propylamine, 3.1 parts of methyl ethyl ketone and 10.4 parts of water. The mixture was reacted at about 1000C 2120F for about 14 hours. The aqueous phase of the reacted mixture is designated Solution A. A sodium silicate solution was prepared by mixing 16 parts water and 27.7 parts sodium silicate 28.7 wt. Si02, 8.9 wt. Na2O, 62.4 H20 followed by addition of 0.08 parts Daxad 27 W. 2 R. Grace Chem. Div. . The solution was cooled to approximately 150C. An acid solution was prepared by adding 1 part aluminum sulfate 17.2 wt. A1203 to 16.4 parts water followed by 2.4 parts NaCI and 2.9 parts of Solution A. These solutions were mixed in an agitated vessel while 3.9 parts of NaCl were added. The gel molar ratios expressed as oxides are the following SiO2 A1203 78.4 Na,O A120, 49.9 The gel was agitated for 4 hours at ambient temperature then heated to 95 1100C 200 2300F and held for 40 hours with severe agitation. When approximately 65 of the gel was crystallized, the temperature was increased to 150 1600C 300 3200F and held there until crystallization was complete. The zeolite slurry product was diluted with 4 5 parts water per part slurry and 0.0002 parts of flocculent Rohm Haas PrimaflocC 7 per part slurry, allowed to settle and supernatant liquid was drawn off. The settled solids were reslurried to the original volume of the preceding step with water and 0.00005 parts of flocculent per part slurry. After settling, the aqueous phase was decanted. This procedure was repeated until the sodium level of the zeolite was less than 1.0 wt. . The washed zeolite was then filtered, dried and identified as ZSM 5 having a silica alumina mole ratio of about 70, and a Constraint Index of about a.3. The dried zeolite product was calcined in flowing N2 for 3 hours at 5400C 10050F then ion exchanged twice with 1 N NH4N03 solution 5 parts NH4NO3 solution l part zeolite for 1 hour at ambient temperature and dried at about 1200C 2500F . EXAMPLES 21 24 The catalyst for Examples 21 24 was prepared using the zeolite prepared according to Example 20 and using the general procedures of Examples 2 and 3 to arrive at a small crystal sizeCs Pt ZSM 5 with 1.6 weight percent platinum. The catalyst pretreatments and hydrogenation reactions were conducted according to the general experimental procedures given in Examples 4 7. The results for Examples 21 24 are shown in Table 5. Pretreatment of this catalyst in the presence of olefins and hydrogen did indeed result in a shape selective hydrogenation catalyst, as shown in Table 5. Furthermore, extended thermal treatment in hydrogen at 4500C 8400F enhanced the selectivity, indicating that platinum once formed inside the zeolite does not migrate rapidly to the external surface, even in the case of a small crystal ZSM 5. In a competitive experiment, styrene was completely hydrogenated whereas less than 10 of the 2methyl styrene was converted. Examples 23 24 illustrate the resistence of the shape selective catalyst of the present invention to poisoning by phosphorous compounds such as phosphine compounds.

The catalyst was employed in hydrogenation reactions at 300 C 570 F 30 WHSV with H2 HC 20. Example 25 shows the results for the employement of the aforementioned catalyst with Examples 26 27 representing further treatment of the catalyst with hydrogen present. Example 28 shows a pretreatment with a paraffin hexane which gives a non shape selective catalyst and S shown for comparison purposes. Results for Examples 25 28 are given hereinbelow in Table 6.

EXAMPLE 29 A catalyst composite is prepared by reducing a ZSM 5 catalyst having an SiO2 A1203 ratio of about 7000 and containing about 0 54 platinum. Reduction is carried out in a stream of nitrogen and hexene 1 while the temperature is raised from room temperature to 4500C at the rate of 20C minute. EXAMPLE 30 Passing n dodecane in hydrogen over the catalyst of Example 29 at 4Q0 C and 0.4 WHSV results in 50t0 conversion to a mixture of products which include 1 normal paraffins, including n undecane and n decane, as well as methane and ethane all products characteristic of metal induced cracking 2 one major cycloparaffin, believed to be n heptyl cyclopentane 3 some skeletal isomers of dodecane, mainly 2 methyl and 3 methyl undecane and 4 aromatics, predominantly n hexylbenzene. Conversion of n nonane under similar conditions produces mainly iso nonanes, noctane, n butylcyclopentane, n propylbenzene, inane, and several C8 and Cg aromatics. Replacement of hydrogen with nitrogen results in an increase in dehydrocycllzation and a decrease in hydrocracking. In addition, hydrogen is a major product obtained. Thus, using n octane as the feed at 4650C, the following conversion results are realized.

The normal paraffin is 65 converted, whereas only 8 conversion of the branched hydrocarbon is observed. EXAMPLE 32 An equimolar mixture of 1,2 dimethylcyclohexane and 1,4 dimethylcyclohexane mixture of isomers is passed over the catalyst of Example 29 in hydrogen at 4000C. The effluent contains 29.7 para xylene and only 12.5 ortho xylene, reflecting a 3 fold selectivity factor in favor of the paraisomer. EXAMPLE 33 When 20 mg tri p tolylphosphine is added to the reaction ofExample 32, the concentration of both xylenes in the effluent decreases to 9.8 para and 0.7 ortho, corresponding to a selectivity factor of 15. Further addition of tri p tolylphosphine has no effect on conversions or selectivity. EXAMPLE 34 To illustrate shape selective dewaxing and reforming, an ArabLight distillate, 400 to 6500F, containing mainly C12 C18 hydrocarbons, is passed over the catalyst of Example 29 at 4650C and 0.4 WHSV Analysis of the product reveals extensive decrease in the normal paraffins and an increase in aromatic content. The pour point of the product is reduced to 420C from the original 200C.
