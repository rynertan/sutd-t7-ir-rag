## Description
This invention relates to disposable diapers. A disposable diaper generally comprises a first sheet of liquid pervious non woven textile material, a second sheet of liquid impervious polyethylene film superimposed on the first sheet and an absorbent pad of paper tissue about 8mm deep between the two sheets. Such diapers are manufactured by depositing parallel tracks of hot melt adhesive about 10mm apart onto one face of a continuously fed web of polyethylene film about 300mm wide. Separate absorbent paper tissue pads of slightly smaller transverse dimension than the web are deposited successively in spaced relation on the web leaving a continuous border about 15mm wide around each pad. A second web of non woven textile material then is superimposed on the pads and the polyethylene web such that the web of non woven textile material adheres to the polyethylene web in the border by contact with the exposed tracks of hot melt adhesive. The combination is then severed to provide a plurality of diapers. A disadvantage of such diapers is that the first and second sheets are secured one to another only where there is hot melt adhesive. In consequence, there are gaps between the tracks of adhesive and, in use, liquid contained in the pads tends to leak through these gaps. Furthermore, the use of hot melt adhesive is unsatisfactory because it requires the provision of a bath of adhesive, a special applicator and a special conformation of feed rolls and heaters. A more satisfactory method of manufacture would be to dispense with parallel tracks of hot melt adhesive and, instead, make use of a film of plastics material having two faces one of which is capable of being rendered adhesive by thermal activation whereby a surface of a liquid absorbent pad located between the film and a sheet of liquid pervious non woven textile material contacts the adherent face of the film and adheres thereto by thermal activation of the film. In FR A 1 165 506 reference is made to activation by heating of a copolymer and the connection of two polymers without using any adhesive. However, the problem with substituting existing materials with such polymers in the manufacture of diapers is the necessity of providing pressure in addition to heat and the fact that the liquid absorbent pads are of significant thickness. The invention is characterised in that the film and the sheet of liquid pervious non woven textile material are nipped together in the border while the film is adherent. In consequence, heat and pressure is applied to unite the film and sheet in the border without crushing the absorbent pad. One embodiment of the invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring firstly to figure 1, the diaper is of common three ply construction, the film ply 2, the pad 4 and the liner ply 6. The liner ply 6 a non woven web of polyester fibres. The pad 4 of the paper tissue is standard inclusion of diapers but the film 2 is a triple layer HAC film 25 microns thick having a matt face 8 and a heat activated face 10. The heat activated face contacts the pad while the matt face lies outermost. The film 2 and liner ply define a continuous mutually adhered border 12 around the pad. The film is layered as shown In FIG 4 and the layers vary in the quantity of adhesion they develop when heated, depending on the vinyl acetate content. Those at the 30 end of the range are better for this purpose than those at the 10 end. The use of triple layer film allows one face to be rendered adherent leaving the opposite face non adherent. The appearance and feel of the opposite face can be modified by the use of fillers while the centre layer supplements the film strength. A double layer film is therefore acceptable but not so suited to requirements. Securing tapes not shown are affixed in the usual way. Referring now to figure 2, an endless conveyor 14 feeds a continuous band of non woven ply toward a pair of nip rolls 16, 18 both of which are induction heated rolls. Pads 4 are placed in correct alignment on the non woven ply leaving a border of about 12mm at the parallel edges of the band. A like conveyor 20 conducts the product away from the nip rolls. A band of film 22 unwinds from roll 24. A pair of driven feed rolls 26 feed the film toward nip roll 16, 18. The lower nip roll 16 is cylindrical whereas the upper roll has a pair of cavities 28, 30 about 4mm deep each equal in circumferential length to the length of a pad. The cavities are separated by a pair of bars 32, 34 which nip the longitudinal border areas leaving the transverse borders to be nipped by rims 36. Both rolls are heated to 100 120 At speeds up to 200 units a minute these heat the film to about 100 Referring now to FIG 4 the heat activatable layer 44 is made of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer made of stock obtainable Du Pont under the Registered Trade Mark ELVAX. The opposite layer 46 is made of low density or linear polyethylene containing fillers to render it matt and soft to the touch. The central layer 48 is made of unmodified low density or linear low density polyethylene to supplement the strength of the three layers. In another version the cavities are divided into sections by ribs creating a striated nip roll. This produces lines of adhesion about 10mm apart and 2mm across. In another embodiment the liner ply is rayon.
