## Description
COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR INHIBITING CORROSION IN STEAM CONDENSATE SYSTEMS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to corrosion control in steam condensate systems and other aqueous systems in which the mineral content is relatively low. More particularly, this invention relates to the ust of methoxypropylamine in combination with hydrazine to control corrosion in steam condensate systems or in other low solids aqueous systems. Condensate corrosion protection is becouiing an in. creasingly important aspect of plant operation. m these energy concious times, an increase in the quantity and quality of condensate will result in water and heat savings for the total boiler system. Historically, the action of dissolved gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide have been two of the nain factors that lead to condensate corrosion.In order to understand the role of oxygen and carbon dioxide in corrosion, one itist understand the electro chaical nature of corrosion. Pure water has very little effect on pure iron, but this situation is seldom encountered. Under most conditions, there is a tendency for iron to dissolve in water, and two electrons are released for each atom that dis solves These electrons are transferred to hydrogen ions present in water, and the ions are reduced to elemental gaseous hydrogen. All action ceases at this point if the hydrogen remains on the surface of the natal since a protective coating is formed that interfers with the passage of electrons.However, any agent which increases the number of hydrogen ions present in the water, or which will cause the removal of the protective fill, serves to increase the rate of corrosion. When carbon dioxide dissolves, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which supplies addi tional active hydrogen to the systems. Iron displaces the hydrogen from this acid. When oxygen is also present in the water, z two fold reaction takes place. Some molecules of oxygen combine with the displaced hydrogen and thus exposes the natal to fresh attack. Other oxygen molecules combine with iron ion to for insoluble rust compounds A greater corroding influence then the mere dissolving tendency of iron is the existence of a heterogeneous surface in commercial iron and steel due to the presence of surface imperfections which tad to for couples with the adjacent base natal. Electrons are released from the anodes of these couples to the hydrogen ions at the adjacent cathodic surface, thus increasing the corroding area and accelerating the rate of corrosion. The first product of corrosion may be converted to ferric oxide, which is only loosely a adherent and aggravates corrosion by blocking off areas to oxygen access. These areas become anodic and iron oxide couples are set up. The iron under the oxide deposit then dissolves, and pitting develops. Carbon dioxide attack results in thinning or grooving of the metal. For those systems that will permit it, filming amines will give condensate corrosion protection against bo oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, many idust 1 systems cannot tolerate filming amines and t t use neutralizing amines. t The i 1 neutralizing amine should have the following racteristics 1. T distribution ratio should be high enough so . at a considerable amount of the neutralizing ami fed to the boiler will end up in the condensate This will reduce the loss of neutralizing amine via blowdown. 2. The distribution ratio should not be too high in orier to keep losses due to aeration and venting to a minimum. The distribution ratio is the ratio of the amount of amine in the vapor phase to that in the liquid phase. 3. The basicity value should be moderately high or very high so that the amine will efficiently neutralize all carbon dioxide that it encounters. 4. The neutralizing amine should have sufficient hydrolytic thermal stability so that it will not break down to ammonia and other compounds in the boiler or in superheated or saturated steam. 5. The neutralizing amine should be a watersoluble liquid for feeding convenience. Neutralizing amines such as cyclohexylazine and morpholine have been used but they have several disadvantages. For example, cyclohexylamine has a high distribution ratio and accordingly, substantial cyclohexylamine escapes the system through the deaerator vent. Morpholine, on the other hand, has a low basicity value which means that more morpholine is required to attain high pH s in the condensate system and it also has a very low distribution ratio which means that substantial amounts are lost via blowdowi. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The neutralizing amine of this invention over cowes the above mentioned disadvantages of cyclo hexylamine and morpholine. Methoxypropylamine has a very desirable distribution ratio and a fairly high basicity value. Methoxypropylamine may be used alone or in combination with an oxygen corrosion inhibitor such as hydrUine. In use, concentrations of 0.1 to 1000 mg l, and preferably 1 to 100 mg l, should be maintained in the steam condensate system. When used in combination with hydrazine or another oxygen corrosion inhibitor, the compositions should contain on an active basis from about 1 to about 995 methoxypropylamine and from about 0.1Z to about 50Z, preferably about 1X to about 157., of the oxygen corrosion inhibitor. The compositions of this invention may be fed to the steam condensate system being treated by conventional liquid feeding means or may be fed to the boiler feedwater or directly to the steam supply lines. The following examples will illustrate the use of methoxypropylamine, alone and in combination with hydrazine, as a steam condensate corrosion inhibitor in accordance with the teachings of this invention EXAMPLE 1 Distribution ratios of a number of neutralizing amines were calculated by preparing solutions of each amine having a concentration of 100 mg l and adding 500 ml of this solution to a brine pot which is slowly and uniformly heated so that 100 ml of distillate is produced every 40 minutes. Additional solution is manually introduced to the brine pot every 5 to 10 minutes to maintain the brine pot solution at the 500 ml mark. Each 100 ml aliquot of distillate is collected and pH determined until constant pH is attained for three successive aliquots. This is taken to represent the establishment of equilibrium conditions. At equilibrium, the brine and the final 100 mls are analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the amount of amine in each and theDistribution Ratio D.R. calculated by the following formula D.R. I Amine Concentration in Final 100 mls Amine Concentration in Brine Similarly, the basicity value Kb or measure of the amine s ability to react with carbon dioxide is calculated in accordance with the formula wherein BH , OH and B are defined as BH concentration of dissociated amine OH s hydroxide concentration B concentration of free, undissociated amine The results of these tests and calculations are set forth in Table I.
