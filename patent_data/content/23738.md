# A method and an arrangement for the manufacture of cylindrical tubes.

## Abstract
For the purpose of producing a packing container a web of laminated material 10 is used, which material includes a base layer of foamed polystyrene 30 , and two outer layers of homogeneous polystyrene. In order to seal the edge zones 21, 22 of the mate rial web into a tube a part of the base layer of one of the edge zones is removed and the other edge zone 21 is inserted into thus cut off part between the remaining end parts 31 of the outer layers and is heat sealed to said outer layers. The so achieved sealing is tight and durable and superior to the known overlap sealing also from the aes thetic point of view. The method and the arrangement in accordance with the invention is advantageous for the production of liquid tight packing containers.
