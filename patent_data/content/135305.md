# A method and apparatus for the low pressure die casting of metals.

## Abstract
A low pressure die casting process in which gaseous pressure is applied to molten metal in a bath C in three stages from three pressure applying circuits. The first circuit applies pressure to lift molten metal to the charging aperture of the die. When the presence of the metal at that die is detected by a sensor 8 , a datum pressure is established and the further application of gaseous pressure to the molten metal is taken over by a second circuit. When the pressure applied to the molten metal differs from the datum pressure by a predetermined amount, an after pressure is applied to the molten metal by the third circuit.
