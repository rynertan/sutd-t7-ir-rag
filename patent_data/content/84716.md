# Method for feeding the growing substrate into the cells in a set of growing cells.

## Abstract
A method for feeding the growing substrate, such as peat, soil, compost, crushed mineral wool, perlite, ver miculite, or bark, by means of a feeding equipment into the cells 6 of the set 4 of growing cells placed underneath the said equipment. The feeding equipment consists of two horizontal feeding rolls 2 , which are placed side by side and which are parallel to each other, pins 3 of a resilient material, e.g. rubber or plastic, preferably polyurethane, being arranged as projecting from the roll faces 7 , the said pins 3 projecting radially. The pins 3 are placed in the normal planes of the axes of the feeding rolls 2 alternating ly in each feeding roll 2 so that, in the space between the feeding rolls 2 , the pins 3 on the feeding rolls 2 are placed as interlocking each other. The feeding rolls 2 are rotated in opposite directions so that the roll faces 7 of the rolls 2 directed towards each other have a downwardly oriented direction of rotation. The filling material of the cells 6 , i.e. the growing substrate, is fed preferably as moist at a high speed into the cells 6 by rotating the feeding rolls 2 at a rotation speed of 500 to 1000 r.p.m. the lower the specific weight of the filling material, the higher the speed of rotation. Thereby the filling material is, by the effect of the circumferential velocity of the feeding rolls 2 of about 3 to 10 m s, rushed in the vertical direction into the cells of the growing cell system 4 so that any filling material in troduced into the cells 6 earlier is compacted by means of the kinetic energy of the filling material, beginning from the bottom.
