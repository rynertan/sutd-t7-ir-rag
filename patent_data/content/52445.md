# Apparatus for detecting and measuring nuclear flux density within a nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
An incore neutron flux detector 12 comprises a plural ity of juxtapositioned pairs of prompt responding detectors 20 and delayed response neutron detectors 20 spaced axially along the active fuel height of a nuclear reactor core. The more accurate delayed response detectors 20 are utilised to provide a generally continuous calibration of the less accurate prompt responding detectors 20 for the flux distribution at the axial position.
