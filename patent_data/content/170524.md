The present invention provides mixtures of the isomeric forms as well as the individual isomers. Thus the compounds of the present invention may exist in either the Suitably the compounds of the formula III to XII are present in the form of the free base or an acid addition salt thereof. Suitable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formulae III to XII include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Solvates, and particularly hydrates, are also within the scope of the present invention. Thus, suitable salts include those formed from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, perchloric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, phosphoric, lactic, benzoic, glutamic, oxalic, aspartic, pyruvic, acetic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, oxaloacetic, isethionic, stearic, phthalic, methanesulphonic, p toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic, lactobionic and glucuronic acids. Most preferably, the acid addition salts will be pharmaceutically acceptable. When the compounds of the formulae III to XII are substituted by hydroxy groups, alkali metal salts of these compounds may be formed and these salts also comprise part of the present invention. Particularly suitable alkali metal salts are those formed with sodium and potassium. Whilst it is possible for a compound of the formula III to be administered alone as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the compound of formula III as a pharmaceutical formulation. The exact method of administration to be used ultimately will be at the discretion of the physician treating the condition and will depend upon the particular nature of the infection being treated. However, it has been found most convenient to administer the compounds of the formulae III or IIIA topically. Accordingly in another aspect, the present invention provides a topical formulation, comprising a compound of the formula III or a salt or acyl derivative thereof in admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The formulation may take the form of an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, paste, gel, spray, aerosol or oil. Formulations particularly suitable for rectal and vaginal administration suitably are presented as unit dose suppositories or pessaries. These may be prepared by admixture of the active ingredient with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example coca butter, and shaping the resulting mixture. Alternatively, in the case of vaginal administration, the formulation may be presented as a tampon impregnated with the active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Other formulation suitable for rectal and vaginal administration include creams, gels, foams, pastes and sprays. The frequency of administration of the composition, the amount of compound administered and the duration of the treatment will of course all vary according to the severity of the infection or condition. Ultimately the treatment regimen will be at the discretion of the physician. Typically, pessaries will be inserted into the vagina singly or in twos or threes, generally once or twice daily. It is often convenient to administer pessaries nightly. Vaginal creams, gels, foams or ointments will generally be administered one to four times daily and, similarly, it may be found convenient to apply the medicament at night. Application of a cream is often assisted by means of an applicator. Often, a cream will be administered in conjunction with another form of the medicament, for example, a tampon or pessary. Combinations such as these are within the scope of the present invention. Tampons will usually be administered once daily although in certain cases it may prove necessary to increase the frequency of administration. The duration of treatment generally will be between one and fourteen days although longer periods may be required in some instances. As mentioned above, the quantity of active compound administered daily will depend upon the severity of the infection but typically it will vary between 10mg and 1g. Most conveniently the quantity of active compound administered will vary between 20mg and 500mg daily. Although topical formulations are preferred, compounds of the present invention may also be administered by other routes eg. orally or parenterally. Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula III in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are meant those compositions and carriers suitable for use in human and or veterinary medicine.The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers present in the compositions of the present invention are materials recommended for the purpose of administering the medicament. These may be liquid, solid or gaseous materials, which are otherwise inert or medically acceptable and are compatible with the active ingredients. These pharmaceutical compositions may be given parenterally, used as a suppository or pessary or applied topically as an ointment, cream or powder. For oral administration, fine powders or granules will contain diluting, dispersing and or surface active agents, and may be presented in a draught, in water or in a syrup, in capsules, cachets or tablets in the dry state or in a non aqueous suspension in water or syrup. Where desirable or necessary, flavouring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying agents can be included. For parenteral administration, the compounds may be presented in sterile aqueous injection solutions which may contain antioxidants, buffers and other pharmaceutically acceptable additives where necessary. Other ingredients which may be included in compositions comprising compounds of the formula III include medically inert ingredients such a solid or liquid diluents eg. lactose, glucose, starch or calcium phosphate for tablets or capsules olive oil or ethyl oleate for soft capsules and water or vegetable oil for suspensions or emulsions lubricating agents such as talc or magnesium stearate gelling agents such as colloidal clays thickening agents such a gum tragacanth or sodium alginate and other therapeutically acceptable accessory ingredients such a humectants, preservatives, buffers and antioxidants which are useful as carriers in such formulations. For application to plants, or plant products such as timber, compounds of the formula IIIa typically are formulated as dusts or powders or as solutions or suspensions for spraying, dipping or painting on to the plant or plant product, the formulations being prepared according to methods well known in the art of plant and plant product protection. Where desired the formulations can be presented as concentrates, eg.powders and liquid concentrates, for dilution to the appropriate strength. The formulations optionally may contain other fungicides and or preservatives, insecticides, dyes, solvents and diluents. For the treatment of timber, particularly suitable methods of administering the compounds of the formula IIIa include dipping, painting or vacuum impregnation of the timber. The antifungal activity of the compounds of the present invention may be evaluated by determining the minimum fungistatic inhibition concentration m.i.c. . This test is usually performed by preparing a series of plates or tubes containing a suitable nutrient medium, each plate or tube also containing a different concentration of the test compound and then inoculating the medium with the fungal species. After an incubation period the plates are examined visually for the presence or absence of fungal growth. The m.i.c. is the minimum concentration required to prevent fungal growth. The antiprotozoal eg. antitrichomonal, activity of the compounds of the present invention may be assessed by conventional methods, for example by determining the minimum inhibition concentration m.i.c. or 50 inhibition level IC₅₀ . It follows from the above that many of the compounds of the present invention are active against both trichomonads and fungi and, indeed, those compounds exhibiting such dual activity represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
