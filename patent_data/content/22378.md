## Abstract
A handle assembly 14 for a luggage case 10 includes an elongated compliant grip 15 having a longitudinally extending opening 24 passing completely therethrough and a pair of parallel grooves 22, 23 on an upper surface, one adjacent each side. First and second hard rigid end members 16, 17 are respectively received in the end openings 24 of the compliant grip 15 and extend angularly away from the same side of the grip. A metal half shell frame 18 which is generally U shaped in cross section, has its side edges 33, 34 received in the grooves 22, 23 on the grip 15 and in similarly dimensioned grooves 27, 28 in the first and second rigid end members 16, 17 . The frame 18 otherwise fits about and covers both the grip 15 and end members 16, 17 to secure them together as a unit. Each end of the metal frame 18 has a keyed opening 38 within which is rotatably received a stub shaft 21 extending from a mounting stanchion 19, 20 . The stanchions 19, 20 are affixed to the top surface of the luggage case cover 12 .
