## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to educational kits which are used to illustrate relatively sophisticated biochemical processes to high school and college students without the use of radioactive materials which are normally used as indicators in such processes. The invention further relates to methods for performing certain structured biochemical processes on a laboratory scale in a manner which assists students of biochemistry, on both a high school and university level, in understanding and visually observing certain fundamental biochemical principles.2. Description of Prior Art and Background The past several years have seen an intense interest on both a high school and university level in the biological sciences. Bio engineering in particular is becoming one of the fastest growing scientific and technological fields. While molecular biology may be taught from textbooks and with the use of relatively crude laboratory experimentation on a high school and college level, efforts at providing more sophisticated laboratory teaching techniques have suffered by virtue of the common use of radionuclides as the standard labelling or tagging agents which are used to follow the progress of various biochemical reactions. Thus, traditionally, protein synthesis is demonstrated by the use of artificial polynucleotides.In such systems, a cell free system such as, for example, Micrococcustreated reticulocyte lysate is incubated together with a source of polynucleotide to synthesize a given polypeptide. Thus, for example, incubation of polyuridilic acid with the lysate results in the synthetic formation of polyphenylalanine. Using presently available techniques, the demonstration of this synthesis to the student is achieved through the use of a radioactive precursor monomeric nucleotide such as H3 phenylalanine. Using further precipitation by means of a trichloracetic treatment, the radioactive product made by the synthesis is identified by its radioactivity in a scintillation counter. However, by virtue of the fact that radioactive materials are used, such techniques and demonstrations are generally not available for general use by students until they have reached an advanced stage in their studies and are well familiar with laboratory procedures, and particularly procedures for safely handling radioactive materials. Likewise, high schools and universities are understandably reluctant to introduce the use of radioactive tracers in their laboratories, as well as to expend the funds to obtain the large and expensive equipment which is necessary for the analysis of such products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide an experimental kit for use in laboratories as well as experimental techniques which simply and clearly illustrate basic biochemical processes without the use of radioactive materials, as well as the heavy and costly equipment associated with the handling and use of radioactive materials. The above objects are achieved according to the invention by providing an educational kit for illustrating the process of protein synthesis which is not radioactive based. The kit includes means for forming a homopolypeptide from a nucleotide source and means for complexing the homqpolypeptide with an antihomopolypeptide antibody provided from an antibody source. The anti homopolypeptides used in this kit may be polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The use of monoclonal antibodies eliminates intermediate washing steps. Means are additionally provided for complexing the homopolypeptide with an enzyme capable of inducing a color reaction. This complexing may be performed by means of an intermediate antibody.The enzyme reaction may be either directly with the antibody, or, by means of a number of known enzyme techniques in which one or a series of intermediate antibodies are used with the enzyme itself automatically ultimately being complexed with one of the antibodies. The enzyme is then used in a conventional manner to produce a color change of a dye. An enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase may be used. In a like manner, the inventive method of illustrating the process of protein synthesis without using radioactive materials includes the steps of forming a homopolypeptide from a nucleotide source and complexing the homopolypeptide with an antihomopolypeptide antibody from an antibody source.Subsequently, the homopolypeptide is reacted with an enzyme capable of inducing a color reaction. Once again, the enzyme itself may be coupled directly to the antibody or may be coupled by means of intermediate antibodies to the product. By means of the enzyme, color changes in associated dyes can be observed. According to another aspect of the invention, an educational kit is also provided which demonstrates the particular codons which are used to produce a product poly peptide containing a particular amino acid sequence. The kit includes a source of mRNA free reticulocyte lysate and a.source of codon containing polynucleotide which comprises at least one, and preferably at least three, codon s which code for the particular amino acid sequence. Means are provided for incubating a mixture of the source materials to form a product poly peptide of the particular amino acid sequence. A source of indicator material is provided and is used to visually indicate that the particular am inc acid sequence has been formed.Where less than three codons are used a single or di peptide is formed while where at least three codons are used, a polypeptide amino acid sequence is formed. In a like manner, according to yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for demonstrating the particular codon s which code for a particular amino acid sequence. Thus, using the method of the invention, mRNA free reticulocyte lysate is incubated together with codon containing polynucleotide which comprises at least one, and preferably, at least three codons, which code for the particular amino acid sequence. As a result of incubation, the particular amino acid is formed which is then visually indicated by means of an indicator material. Obviously, a preferred indicator material is one which is nonradioactive, and, is most preferably, an enzyme capable of inducing a color change in a dye. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 illustrates schematically an educational kit for illustrating the process of protein synthesis and Fig. 2 illustrates an educational kit for demonstrating the particular codons used to produce a particular amino acid sequence. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1. Educational Kit for Illustrating Process ofProtein Synthesis As may be seen with reference to Fig. 1, protein synthesis in a Micrococcus treated reticulocyte lysate is performed in the presence of 5 micrograms ml of polyuridilic acid. The synthesis is performed, preferably, using variable added quantities of Mg , in concentrations from 0 15mM final concentration , in test tubes which contain a final volume of 100 microliters at a pH of about 7.4 and substrate conditions as in Pelham, R.B. and Jackson, R.J., Eur.J. Biochem, 67 247 256, 1976 step 1 . After incubation at about 30 deg. C for about 30 minutes, the solution is added to a microtiter plate in the presence of 15mM EDTA to block further Mg ions step 3 . The wells are coated with goat antipolyphenylalanine step 2 . After an additional 30 60 minutes of incubation at 37 deg. C in the wells of the microtiter plate, the wells are emptied. The product polyphenylalanine adheres to the well walls and is washed twice with saline buffer solution containing detergent step 4 so as to eliminate traces of the lysate. The washed product is then reacted with goat antipolyphenylalanine which is complexed with a colorinducing enzyme step 5 , e.g., horseradish peroxidase.If the two sets of antibodies used in steps 2 and 5 were both monoclonal antibodies, washing step 4 may be eliminated. The extent to which the antipolyphenylalanine has complexed with polyphenylalanine is indicative of the extent of polyphenylalanine which has been formed and can be readily observed by known enzyme dye colorimetric techniques step 6 . The reaction may be further enhanced by the use of enzyme labeled rabbit, donkey, or goat antibodies as a secondary reaction. Results are read either by visual evaluation of the staining reaction or by the use of a spectrophotometer. 2. Educational Kit for Demonstrating ParticularCodons Used to Produce a Particular Amino Acid Sequence Four lines of wells of a microtiter plate are each coated as follows a one line of wells is coated with antipolyphenylalanine b one line of wells is coated with antipolyprol ine c one line of wells is coated with antipolyleucine d one line of wells is coated with antipolyserine. Protein synthesis in endogenous mRNA free reticulocyte lysate is performed step 1 in the presence of each of the four following starting materials a 5 micrograms of polyuridylic acid poly U b 5 micrograms of polycytidylic acid poly C c 2.5 micrograms of poly U and 2.5 micrograms poly C d Poly C, U, containing equal quantities of C and U. Each of the starting materials is incubated as in example 1 for protein synthesis to occur, but in the presence of 5mM Mg . Protein synthesis is then interrupted and the lysates are inactivated by adding 15mM EDTA. The proteins are then reacted with the rows of microtiter coated wells in the same manner as inExample 1 steps 2 and 3 . After amplifying by reaction with a second antibody, as was discussed in connection with Example 1 steps 4 6 , the following observations are made in connection with each of the syntheses Only antipolyphenylalanine coated wells develop a staining reaction in connection with possibility 1 , thus establishing that one of the codons for polyphenylalanine is UUU. Antipolyproline coded wells develop a staining reaction with possibility 2 , thus establishing that one of the codons for proline is CCC. With the mixture of possibility 3 , the anttpolyphenylalanine and antipolyproline coated wells react, while neither antipolyserine nor antipolyleucine wells react. This again confirms that one of the codons for phenylalanine is UUU and that one of the codons for proline is CCC. Using possibility 4 , all of the coated wells develop a reaction, thus confirming the hybrid nature of the codons which cause the translation of phenylalanine, serine, leucine and proline. However, the antipolyserine and antipolyleucine coated wells developed the strongest stained reaction confirming the alternating nature of the bases within the codons for each of these peptides. The preceding results indicate the following requirements a to produce polyphenylalanine the polynucleotide must be either pgolyuridylic acid homopolymer UUU or polyuridylicytidylic acid copolymer UUC b to produce polyserine the polynucleotide must be polyuridylicytidylic acid copolymer UCU orUCC c to produce polyleucine the polynucleotide must be polyuridylicytidylic acid copolymer CUU or CUC and d to produce polyproline the polynucleotide must be either polycytidylic acid homopolymer CCC or polyuridylicytidylic acid copolymer CCU . The above kits are merely examples of ways in which the principles of the invention may be achieved, i.e., laboratory kits which do not use radioactivebased ir.dicators. Therefore, it is clear that the kits and method of the invention may undergo numerous variations without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the claims.
