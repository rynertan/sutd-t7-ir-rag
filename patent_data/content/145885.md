# Filter element.

## Abstract
A filter element has a generally ring like structure which basically comprises a plurality of generally radial sections circumferentially arranged to define a central space. Each radial section has a plurality of circumferenti ally zigzag pleats formed from a ribbon of a filtering sheet material. The radial sections are circumferentially connect ed such that radially inwardly open generally radial spaces and radially outwardly open generally radial spaces are defined. The radially inwardly open radial spaces are closed at the axially opposite ends by end walls. Fluid to be filtrated can enter the radially outwardly open radial spaces and then passes through the zigzag pleats into the radially inwardly open radial spaces and thus into the central space. The ring like structure has many modifications.
