# A zero if demodulator and method of demodulation.

## Abstract
A demodulator which enables the sampling of the phase angle of a modulated signal and manipulates the sample signals to demodulate the signal. The apparatus is particularly adaptable for use in demoduiating the I and Q channel signals of a zero IF receiver. The system contains an angle sensing circuit 20 which combines the I and Q channel signals in differential form to produce a series of output signals of an angular range indicative of the present value of the instantaneous phase. The signals from the angle sensor 20 are coupled to a segment decoder 21 which operates to determine the particular segment that the angle is to be included in In the embodiments described eight segments or octants are used, each comprising 45 DEG . The octant decoder 21 determines which octant the angle belongs in and assigns a predetermined angle value to that angle. In one embodiment, the assigned angle values are 0 DEG , 45 DEG , 90 DEG , 135 DEG , 180 DEG , 225 DEG , 270 DEG or 315 DEG . The value of the assigned angles are then samples by means of a clock at a high frequency rate whereby the resultant pulses indicative of the angles are then processed as differentiated to produce an output signal indicative of the information content on the original signal.
