# A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A window is opened in an insulating film 12 on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 11 to expose a surface region A of the substrate. The exposed surface region A at least is covered with a light transmitting film 14 of a thickness ta mλ 4n, where λ is the wavelength of a laser beam to be employed for irradiating for selective heating and annealing in a region 13 of substrate 11 corresponding to the exposed surface region A , n is the index of refraction of film 14 and m is an odd integer including unity . Such a film thickness ensures effective heating of region 13 without damage to other parts of the substrate 11.
