# Synchronization apparatus.

## Abstract
Two controller units 11, 12 controlling a single input output device such as a cathode ray tube CRT are syn chronized by a command signal. Upon appearance of the command signal, the slave controller unit 12 , which may have been running unsynchronized with the master control ler 11 , is stopped at the time for vertical retrace and remains stopped until vertical retrace time for the master controller. At this point, the slave controller is restarted in synchronism with the master controller and remains syn chronized so long as both master and slave receive the same clock and the same screen refresh parameters.
