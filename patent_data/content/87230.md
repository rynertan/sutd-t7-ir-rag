# Sheet corner registration apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for driving a sheet 14 into a corner registra tion with registration members defining two orthogonal registration lines 44, 46 , including a sphere 11 mounted to overly and drivingly engage a sheet 14 being so registered, said sphere 11 being rotatable on variable axes and vertically and laterally movable relative to the sheet, includ ing a drive 12 engaging the sphere for rotatably driving said sphere 11 and a sheet 14 in an initial direction of rotation towards both orthogonal registration lines 44, 46 , but allowing changes in the direction of rotation of the sphere 11 and lateral movement of the sphere relative to its retainer 13 and different positions of engagement there against in response to the different reaction forces on the sphere from a sheet being driven by said sphere, and including a normal force control system associated with the retainer 13 for automatically varying the normal force between the sphere and the sheet being driven in response to the lateral movement of the sphere and the reaction force, this normal force control preferably being provided by selected non uniform higher frictional rolling resistance or differently sloped sectors of the sphere retainer 13 interior surface.
