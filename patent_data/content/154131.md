# Radiation image read out and gradation processing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a system for reading out a radiation image stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet and processing the gradation of the image, final read out is conducted by use of a read out condition GP determined on the basis of image information obtained by preliminary read out. On the basis of the image recording portion and or image recording conditions, the system selects whether to directly subject the output of the final read out conducted by use of a read out condition GP to a gradation processing under a gradation processing condi tion GH predetermined in accordance with the image recording portion and or image recording conditons or to subject the output to a gradation processing effected by use of a gradation processing condition A GP xGH where A GP denotes the function determined by the image recording portion and or image recording conditions.
