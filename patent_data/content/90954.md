# Increment charge for a finned projectile.

## Abstract
Increment charge 6 for a finned projectile 1 designed to surround a cartridge tube 2 on the projectile and to be ignited by the ignition gases from a propellant and ignition cartridge 4 included in the cartridge tube 2 . The surface of the increment charge 6 which faces the cartridge tube 2 is enlarged in that it is provided with a number of recesses 11 which provide access for the said ignition gases. The increment charge 6 consists appropriately of a number of powder discs 7 of horseshoe shape, provided with holes, the inner edge 8 of which is asymmetric relative to the aperture 10 of the horseshoe shape. Each alternate disc 7 is inverted so that the shape of the hole edge 8 is inverted in mirror fashion for each alternate disc 7 .
