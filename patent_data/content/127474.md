The flexible container comprises two outer walls 2 joined together in a surrounding seam 6 , an inlet 54 and, if desired, an outlet 58 . The inlet is provided with a non return valve formed by enveloping a tube end 76 in two intermedi ate layers having the same lateral extent as the outer walls 2 of the container, the intermediate layers having free edges 80 spaced from the mouth 78 of the tube. The intermediate layers lie closely against each other in an area 56 situated between the edges 80 and the mouth 78 and delimited laterally by seams 72,74 joining the intermediate layers. The intermediate layers extend longitudinally of the container to a greater distance from the mouth 78 that the distance from the mouth 78 to the free edges 80 , the free edges 80 bordering on an opening 66 in each of the intermediate layers, and said openings 66 delimiting the non return valve.
