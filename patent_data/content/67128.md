## Description
Heavy duty electrical outlet with mechanical interlock switchThe object of the present invention is a heavy duty electrical outlet with mechanical interlock switch.Heavy duty electrical outles with mechanical interlock switches are hnown technology. These consist of a box made of an insulating material, closed by a cover, containing a multi pole outlet facing an opening through which the plug is inserted or removed. The outlet is controlled by a multi pole switch which can be used to apply or remove current from the outlet. This switch is housed inside the aforementioned box, and is maneuvered from the exterior by a sealed knob that extends out from the cover.A mechanical interlock mechanism is provided for safety reasons, preventing insertion or removal of the electrical plug from the outlet with the switch closed with, therefore, current present , and stopping the switch from being closed when the plug is absent. The switches used in these heavy duty outlets are of rotary type, known as pack switches , and consist of an axial shaft, placed perpendicular to the bottom of the box. At its top end this shaft is engaged with the control knob that extends out from the cover, and at its bottom end it carries a disk, or cam, that revolves together with the shaft. A hole is made on the face of this disk which takes on a specific angle when the switch is open.The hole, placed in this position, permits the rear end of a bar to be inserted into it. When the bar is in this position it removes the restraint from a lever, which becomes free to swing as it is pushed by plugging in or pulling out the plug. When the plug is removed this bar remains fixed in the hole, due to an elastic mechanism, so that it stops the switsh from closing.These electrical outlets present several problems, due to use of a rotary pack switch .One first problem is due to the fact that the pack switch is often heavy and bulky, so that its box is out of proportion to the size of the outlet, and, above all, to the nominal current levels forecast for the outlet itslef.Another problem is that, because of their structure, pack switches cannot be put together at the job site, and thus the installar cannot adapt them to meet unforeseen requirements, arising both during installation and during normal maintenance. Another problem is that if one of the components of the switch breaks down the entire switch must be removed and replaced, since on site repair would be e extremely costly. Another very important problem is that these pack switches are only manually controlled switches, so that each heavy duty outlet also requires installation of separate multipole protection devices that intervene in case of overload, short circuits and, often, leakage of current to ground.All this leads to increased installation and appliance costs and to substantial bulk.The heavy duty electrical outlet object of the present invention has as its goal elimination of all the aforemen tioned problems.This outlet is characterized by the fact that it uses, as a multi pole switch controlling the outlet itself, a number of single pole circuit breakers placed side by side equal to the number of outlet poles. These switches are maneuvered by swinging levers which are rigidly connected together to provide simultaneous manual control, said switches are mounted on a rail installed on the bottom of the container box, a device is provided for simultaneous maneuver of these levers using a swivelling knob that extends out from the box cover, the lever assembly is connected to the disk of the interlock mechanism so that the swinging movement of these levers is transformed into the rotaty motion of said disk, for normal operation of the interlock device. The use of single pole circuit breakers gives heavy duty electrical outlets all the tecnical and practical advantages these switches can offer.Their limited bulk, even for very high nominal current levels, permits a reduction in both the weight and the bulk of heavy duty outlets. Their assembly line manufacture and relatively low cost make it advantageous for them to replace a pack switch, giving a cost savings.They also permit, at the installation site, individual replacement of each circuit breaker, changes in their polarity, and changes in their number, as installation and maintenance needs dictate.Another big advantage is that single pole circuit breakers themselves constitute protective appliances that shield against current problems, leading to a drastic reduction in materials and installation costs and in bulk.These and other characteristics will be seen in the description that follows of a non iting embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the enclosed drawings, where Figure 1 shows a partially sectioned side view of a box containing a heavy duty electrical outlet and housing the single pole circuit breaker assembly and the control device for these Figures 2 and 3 are exploded views illustrating the parts that compose, respectively, the control knob and device installed for simultaneous maneuvering of the switch levers Figure 4 is a view from below of the assembled items in figures 2 and 3 Figure 5 shows a plan of the bottom of the box, with the layout of the interlock disk Figure 6 is an isometric view of the lever connecting the switch control levers to the aforesaid disk, to make it rotate.With reference to these figures, number 1 indicates part of a casing containing a heavy duty outlet with mechanical interlock switch.Casing 1 consists of box 2 and cover 2, which seals the box.Housings are made on the bottom 4 of box 2, to hold an outlet appliance not illustrated in the figures , a multi pole switch 5, electrically connected to the outlet and to the electric mains by cables which are also not il3iistrated, and mechanical interlock mechanism of mechanism of which we can see, in figures 1 and 5, a disk 6 and a safety bar 7, sliding but restrained within guide 8. Safety bar 7 is designed to engage one end 7a, within a slot 9 made radially in disk 6. It is also, in a known and standard manner, coupled approximately at its other end, not represented in the figure, to a lever that is pinned to the base and that can be moved, when the switch is open, by a plug as it is inserted or removed from the outlet.This outlet has also not been illustrated in the figure, because it is a known and standard device.In accordance with the present invention multi pole switch 5 consists of a number of normally modular single pole circuit breakers placed side by side, with control lever 10 in front. The levers of all the switches placed side by side are rigidly connected together to permit simultaneous control.The single pole switches figure 1 shows only one from the side, since the others are hidden by the first are mounted on a rail, schematized by 11, attached to bottom 4 of box 2 by known fastening components which make up part of the single pole switches themselves. With reference to figures from 1 to 4, lever assembly 10 is maneuvered by knob 12, housed in its own seat 13 and opening on the outer surface of cover 3. Seat 13 carries ring groove 14 which houses seal 15 that stops water or other undesirable elements from entering box 2. Knob 12 is connected to lever 10 by a coupling device that transforms the rotary movement of knob 12 into the swinging movement of lever 10.This device includes flange 16, equipped with toothed segment 17, and which carries, at its top, a polygonal preferably square section head 18, which functions to axially engage itself in corresponding cavity 19 made in the base of knob 12. Head 18 is hollow, and contains tubular device 20, which in turn contains self threading screw 21. This, engaged in hole 22 machined coaxially in the base of knob 12, permits flange 16 to be secured to the knob itself.This device also calls for a basically rectangular shaped frame 23 which carries, on two opposed sides 23a and 23b, two by two parallel and coaxial slots 24. Slots 24 engage with support and guide pins 25 made on the inner face of cover 2, in correspondence with seat 13 of knob 12 fig.3 . The bottom section of pins 25 has a smaller cross section than the top section, and contain a threaded hole.Fastening screws 27 and spacer washers 26 are secured in these holes.Frame 23 is installed with slots 24 facing pins 25, but fastening screws 27. In this way pins 25 furnish an axial slide guide for the entire frame 23. This frame is also equipped with short rack 28, whose teeth mesh with teeth 17 of flange 16 so that, when knob 12 is rotated, a traverse movement of frame 23 will correspond to a rotary movement of flange 16.Frame 23 is also equipped with a pair of raised elements 29. A cross member 30 fig. 4 fits on these, and connects sides 23a and 23b of frame 23 together.Cross member 30 has, on its bottom, at least one pair of nibs 31, placed facing each other, and designed to couple with control lever 10 of switch 5 below.With reference to figures 1 and 5, and in accordance with the present invention, connection means are provided to transform the swinging motion of lever 10 into the rotary motion of disk 6 of the mechanical interlock device.In this regard note that disk 6 is installed revolving on pin 32, which is attached in an opportune position to bottom 4.The aforementioned connection means consist of lever 33, swinging in a predetermined point on pin 34, which is housed in seat 35 machined in side wall 2a of the box.The top end 33a of lever 33 is shaped like a yoke, folding above the switches to couple with lever 10. The bottom end 33b of lever 33 is sligntly sloped towards the inside so it can engage in corresponding slot 36 machined, in a radial direction, in disk 6 of the mechanical interlock deviceAs far as operation is concerned, xe shall limit ourselves at this time to describing opening and closing operations of the switch assembly, operations which interact with the mechanical interlock mechanism and cause the rotation of disk 6. But we shall not go into the subject of inserting or removing a plug from the outlet,which causes the mechanical interlock mechanism to intervene, since this operation is standard and known, and is therefore not part of the present invention.By rotating knob 12 polygonal lead 18 transmits a similar movement to flange 16. During rotation toothed segment 17, meshing with rack 28 on frame 23, causes movement by translation of this last, which is also imparted to cress member 30. Thanks to the presence of teeth 31, which mesh with lever 10, a swinging movement of lever 10 will correspond to the movement by translation of cross member 30. Depending on the direction of rotation given to knob 12, lever 10 shall be moved in one direction or in the other, causing the switch to open or close. Lever 33 shall simultaneously swing in one direction or the other, so that, with the switch open, cavity 9 in disk 6 will be brought to the position indicated by the full lines in figure 5, permitting insertion of the rear end of bar 7.With the plug inserted, and the switch closed, the disk will be turned to an angle where cavity 9 is in the position indicated by the dashed lines, preventing the plug from being plugged into the outlet.It has been seen that the use of single pole circuit breakers, installed side by side, in place of a pack type rotary switch, presents the advantages already indicated in the introduction to this description.Naturally many structural variants and modifications can be brought to the putlet in achieving the present invention without, because of this, going beyond the limits of patent protection.
