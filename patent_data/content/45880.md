# Improved cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
Cutting apparatus 20 for severing slices from a comesti ble product, especially meat bodies, having a rotary knife blade 28 and a rotary magazine 26 for moving comestible products in an endless path across the blade. The magazine has product receptacles 76, 77 constructed for convenient removal from a one piece molded plastic supporting base 40, all of which facilitates cleaning the machine. The base 40 is received on the end of a drive shaft 30 and is adjustable in height relative to the shaft. A plate 71 secured to the shaft and clamped against the base secures the receptacles and eliminates wobble from clearance between the base and shaft. Projections 122, 123 from the plate 71 transmit rotary force between the drive shaft and base. Pusher plate assemblies 94, 96 slide along the receptacles to urge products through the magazine 26.
