# Ionization gauge.

## Abstract
An ionization gauge of the type including a source of electrons, an accelerating electrode for accelerating said electrons through a volume generally defined by said accelerating electrode and a collector electrode, disposed in the volume. Ions are collected by the collector electrode. The accelerating electrode comprises a substantially closed anode having an internal cavity to precisely define the volume. An aperture is disposed to admit said electrons from the source into the closed volume.
