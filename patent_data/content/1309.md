# Meat aroma precursor composition.

## Abstract
An aroma precursor composition comprising a hydrogen sulfide precursor, preferably cysteine a dimethyl sulfide precursor, preferably S methyl methionine and an edible proteinaceous material, preferanly soy protein. Upon heating or cooking in the presence of water, the precursor composition generates an aroma surprisingly reminiscent of cooked beef. Preferably, the precursor composition is substantially dry until ready to cook, then an effective amount of water is added thereto, whereby, upon cooking the aroma is generated in situ.
