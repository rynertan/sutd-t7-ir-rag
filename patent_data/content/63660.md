The mechanical joint is comprised of a split locking ring 8 preferably consisting of two separate segments, fitting into an annular outwardly opening channel 10 in the wear resistant insert 2 . The split locking ring 8 is fastened to the retaining ring 11 to lock the wear resistant insert 2 into place.
