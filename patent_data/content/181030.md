# Arrangement for supervising a CMI code converter.

## Abstract
Arrangement for supervising a CMI code converter in a PCM multiplex transmission system, in which a binary signal is converted into a CMI signal or vice versa, the code converter having a first teminal for the CMI signal and a second terminal for the binary signal, characterized in that the first input of the code converter is connected to a first input of a modulo 2 divider 4 and also via a delay element 3 to a second input of the modulo 2 divider 4 that the output of the modulo 2 divider is connected to a first input of a summing device 7 , that the second terminal of the decoder unit is connected to a second input of the summing device 7 and that the supervising signal 10 is produced at the output of the summing device 7 .
