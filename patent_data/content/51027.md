## Description
MOLDED TORXC CONTACT LENSES This invention relates to the manufacture of plastic contact lenses having optical surfaces, at leastone surface being a toric surface, and having prism ballast and cylinder. Apparatus and procedure for making such lenses are also discloses. Toric contact lens were first introduced byStimpson in 1950 while the toric base contact lens was described in 1952 and 1953 by Schapero and Baglien.Prior art procedures for the manufacture of toric contact lens are time consuming and fairly expensive and involve a considerable amount of hand finishing.Moreover, the apparatus used to fabricate such lenses are often elaborate and difficulty is encountered to achieve reproducible results. Illustrative patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,079,737 3,344,692 3,482,906 3,535,825 3,623,800 and 3,950,082. Contact lenses may be prepared by a casting method in order to reduce or eliminate costly machining and polishing of the lens as described in U.S. PatentNo. 4,121,896, issued October 24, 1978 in the name ofT. H. Shepherd. According to the process described in this United States patent, complementing replica male and female mold members each having an optical molding surface are prepared by injection molding of a plastic composition in the master mold pairs.The plastic mold members are then used to mold contact lenses, one of the molding surfaces being provided with a flexible circumferential rim which defines the periphery of the resulting lens. The lens forming material which will constitute the lens is charged into the female mold member or portion. The complementing male member or portion is brought into contact with the female mold member so that the flexible rim portion is seated on the opposite molding surface. During molding the lens forming material contracts causing the flexible rim to flex whereby the two mold members move towards each other.Once the molding cycle is completed the mold members are separated and the resulting contact lens is removed in a condition ready for use, except for cleaning and perhaps a buffering of the lens edge. A toric lens comprises two basic parts namely, a cylinder to correct astigmatism of the eye and prism ballast for ensuring positional stability when placed on the cornea. Non astigmatic lenses do not have such a requirement and the lens is allowed to rotate freely upon the layer of tears carrying it. Toric lenses, on the other hand, require proper, rather precise, positioning in the eye. One procedure to achieve lens stability is to remove a small portion, e.g., 1 to 1.5 inirt, of an outer chord of the contact lens generally about 14 mm in diameter . This is called truncation. Opposed parallel clippings are called double truncations.Another means of achieving positional stability to a toric contact lens is to provide a somewhat larger mass of plastic material at or proximate an edge of the lens so that, in use, when the lens rotates this heavier edge will gravitate towards the bottom of the axis of rotation, i.e., the lower eyelid, and serve to stabilize the lens on the eye.This is known in the art as prism ballast. A method for molding toric contact lenses is described in United States Patent 4,208,365, issuedJune 17, 1980 in the name of Robert J. LeFevre in which, like the Shepherd patent mentioned above, a mold system comprised of a pair of mold members is used to cast the lens, the desired toric optical surface being achieved by distorting the optical molding surface of one of the flexible mold members used to mold the lens. Distortion of the member is incuded by tensioning means such as a torque ring surrounding the mold part to achieve the desired configuration. The mold system containing lensforming material is then closed by positioning the mold members in lens forming relationship with each other, the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of each mold member being in alignment.The patentee s casting technique produces the cylinder feature of the cast toric contact lens however, there is no significant accommodation for positionable stability. Lack of significant prism ballast limits the commercial applicability of a toric contact lens. Heretofore, plastic contact lenses having prism ballast were prepared by mechanical operations, for instance, on an optical type special purpose lathe in which the plastic part is manually polished and finished by hand, a costly and time consuming procedure. Accordingly, one or more of the following objects will be achieved by the practice of the invention. One object of the invention is to provide a method for molding a plastic toric contact lens having prism ballast and cylinder. Another object of the invention is to provide molding apparatus and methods using such apparatus for fabricating toric contact lenses having predetermined prism ballast and cylinder at relatively low cost without the need for extensive and expensive manual finishing operations. Another object of the invention is to provide a mold assembly comprised of lens forming mold members, a first mold member having an optical concave toric molding surface, a second mold member having an optical convex molding surface, and the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of each of said molding surfaces forming an angle e when said mold members are in lensforming relationship with each other. Another object of the present invention is to produce a prism ballast toric shaped contact lens, hard or flexible, by a castìng method in a closed mold system which compensates for shrinkage that occurs during polymerization or vulcanization of the lensforming material used to make the lens. It is also an object of this invention to provide method for producing cast toric lenses in a closed mold system, such lenses having positionable stability and power as well as the desirable optical and fitting characteristics of machined and polished toric lenses. These and other objects will be apparent from the following description. The present invention is concerned with apparatus useful in the manufacture of toric contact lenses and to methods utilizing such apparatus in the production of such lenses. The resulting toric contact lenses are characterized by cylinder and prism ballast which exhibit significant positional stability in the eye of the wearer. In one aspect of the invention there is provided a mold assembly comprised of lens forming mold members, one such mold member having an optical concave toric molding surface and a principal longitudinal axis of curvature, a second such mold member having an optical convex molding surface and a principal longitudinal axis of curvature, the aforesaid two longitudinal axes of curvature forming an angle e , hereinafter discussed and shown in the appended drawings, when the said mold members are in lens forming relationship with each other. In another aspect the invention is directed to a process of casting a prism ballasted toric lens from a mold assembly comprised of a first mold portion having an optical concave toric molding surface and a second mold portion having an optical convex molding surface which comprises a charging a contact lens forming material on to the molding surface of said first mold portion b closing the mold assembly by positioning said second mold portion in lens forming relationship with said first mold portion at an angle e with respect to the principal longitudinal axes of curvature of each of said molding surfaces, said angle o not exceeding 200 and c subjecting the lens forming material to activating conditions for a period of time sufficient to produce a contact lens characterized by a front optical convex toric surface, a back optical concave surface, and significant positional stability when in use as a contact lens. In one embodiment the present invention features the use of a multi component molding system especially male and female mold portions, either the male portion or the female portion or both being fabricated of flexible material, e.g., thermoplastic material. Both the male portion and female portion are provided with an optical molding surface, e.g., spherical, which have a predetermined curvature. Means are provided to place a predetermined measured stress or force on one flexible mold portion, preferably the female mold portion, at or in the proximity of the periphery of its optical molding surface. This force causes a distortion of its normal molding surface whereby it assumes the configuration of a toric surface. Lens forming material is charged into the deformed female mold portion.The male mold portion is inserted into the female mold portion in a manner such that 1 the lens forming material is bound by the optical molding surfaces of the two mold portions and 2 the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of each molding surface not being coincidental or in alignment but rather forming an angle termed 6. For convenience, the principal longitudinal axis of curvature with respect to the female molding surface a principal longitudinal axis which can be considered, for convenience and ready reference, to be the ordinate or y axis is maintained fully perpendicular to two axes which are tangent to the base or apex of the female molding surface, each of the said two axes being perpendicular to each other and in the same plane. The said two axes can be considered to be the x axis abscissa and the z axis.The principal longitudinal axis of curvature of the male molding surface would involve the corresponding axes which, for convenience, can be designated as the y, x and z axes . Thus, in our illustration, the angle o represents the deviation from alignment of these two principal lonqitudinal axes y and y , one of which is maintained fully perpendicular as noted above, and the other being oblique. The angle 0, in effect, defines the amount of prism ballast which is traditionally measured in diopters and which is imparted to the toric lens produced by the practice of the invention. Broadly, this angle e can range up to about 15 to 20 degrees, generally up to about 100.From a commercial standpoint it is desirable to maintain angle e within the range of about 2 to about 8 , preferably about 3 to about 6 . The working examples herein give a comparison of the angle o variation from 30 to 60 , power and prism for toric 0 lenses 180 10 axis. In various other embodiments the male mold portion is provided with a substantially cylindrical support segment having the optical molding surface attached circumferentially around the lower portion of the support segment. The female portion, in preferred embodiments, is provided with a hollow cylindrical support segment having the optical molding surface attached circumferentially around its base. The optical molding surfaces can be spherical or aspherical.The inner diameter of said cylindrical support segment of the female mold member is somewhat larger than the external diameter of said hollow cylindrical support segment of the male mold member so that there is sufficient clearance for the male support segment to be insertable into the female cylindrical support segment to obtain the desired angle e and to permit lens forming material to flow out between the two segments and or otherwise be removed. The clearance, however, should not be so great as to permit the two principal axes to be non aligned to a significant degree which would adversely affect the optical characteristics of the lens to be produced.In another embodiment the receiving mold component has a hollow cylindrical support segment or wall that is present at a selected angle so that the lens forming material between the male and female mold portions is compressed and positioned at a predetermined angle i. In preferred embodiments one of the molding surfaces is provided with a flexible circumferential rim preferably integral with one of the optical molding surfaces which in the practice of the invention will define the periphery or edge of the resulting toric contact lens. As indicated in the background section above, during the molding operation, the lensforming material contracts especially during addition or condensation reactions causing the flexible rim to flex whereby the two mold members move toward each other. For further details of flexible rim construction, materials, etc., one is referred to U.S. Patent No.4,212,896 and 4,208,365, the disclosures of which are fully incorporated by reference as if set out in full text. Means can be provided to effect a predetermined or measured stress or force on a flexible mold portion, be it the female portion or the male portion, preferably on the female portion. Such means can be illustrated by various tension creating devices, e.g., spring loader plunger in which the plunger creates a predetermined force on the wall of a flexible mold member thereby causing its optical surface to assume the desired toric configuration flexible closed spring which preforms the same function a circumferential torque ring which applies pressure to a flexible mold portion, the torque ring having adjustable impingement means such as screws or the like for deforming the flexible mold portion into the desired toric configuration.Desirably there are at least two impingement means but there can be more, e.g., 3 or 4. Any other adjustment means can be employed to place a stress on the flexible mold whereby its molding surface is deformed to a predetermined toric configuration. Information regarding the fabrication and composition of the mold components as well as method of flexing one of them and achieving a toric surface on the contact lens are described in United States Patent 4,208,365, issued June 17, 1980, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated by reference as if set out in full text. Figure 1 is an elevated perspective view of the lens mold system and torque ring in position about the lower female portion of said system. Figure 2 is a plan cross sectional view of a lens mold system in a closed position, the male mold member being provided with a cylindrical support segment having an optical molding surface attached circumferentially around the lower portion of said support segment and a circumferential flexible rim around said optical molding surface as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,208,365, issued June 17, 1980, a circumferential torque ring in position applying a shaping force to the female mold member, and the male mold member and female mold member forming an angle 0. Figure 3 is a plan cross sectional view of still another lens mold system in the closed position in which the side walls of the female mold member are set a predetermined angle to receive the inserted male mold member, the two members forming the angle e. Figure 4 is an elevated perspective view of a molded toric contact lens, partially broken away, having a prism ballast at the lower portion thereof. Figure 5 is a plan cross sectional view of another lens mold system in the closed position the circumferential torque ring in position applying a shaping force to the female mold part the support segment of the male mold member inserted into the hollow cylindrical support segment of the female mold member at an angle i and means to maintain as well as to adjust angle 9 at a preset value. Figure 6 is a plan cross sectional view of a lens mold system in the closed position the circumferential torque ring positioned and applying a shaping force to the flexible male mold member. Figures 7 8 are vertical cross sectional views of the mold members forming the mold assembly used in U.S. 4,208,365 for producing contact lenses and with modification can be used in certain embodiments of the present invention. Figure 9 is a top planar view of the circumferential torque ring. The present invention, in its preferred aspect, employs a flexible female mold portion to provide the finished lens with a toric configuration on the front or anterior optical surface. The desired amount of prism ballast, customarily measured in diopters, is iRpatted to the finished molded lens by inserting one of the mold parts into the other mold part so that the desired angle e is subtended by the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of each molding surface.This constitutes one adjustment of the novel molding process. The angle e, in effect, governs the amount of prism ballast. Thus, a value of about three degrees 30 for the angle o in the working examples resulted in toric lenses having a prism of about 0.5 diopter while an angle o of 6 resulted in a prism of about 1.5 diopters. Prism ballast indicates a weighted portion of the produced lens allowing for rotation on the eye of the wearer. Gravity correctly positions the lens.While prism or prism ballast is an indication of weight or mass, the thickening of the lens causes diffraction of light rays passing through the thickening area. This diffraction is measured on aVertexometer which gives a reading in diopters. Thus, measurement of prism in diopters is an indirect measurement of the weight of the prism. A second adjustment in the novel molding process provides for the required configuration of the optical molding surface of the flexible female mold member, for example, by impinging two opposed set screws into contact with the lower portion of this mold member, thus distorting the female optical molding surface and achieving the required toricity for the molded lens.While there are numerous variations possible as to this second adjustment relative to the first, for purposes of the following description it will be assumed that the impingement or flexing of the lower mold portion and the angle 9 achieved by tilting one of the mold parts with respect to the other are both in the same plane. As shown in Figuresl and 2, the mold comprises a male mold member 2 which may be of a flexible or rigid material, a flexible female mold member 4 and a circumferential torque ring 6. Male mold member 2 includes a substantially cylindrical support segment 7 having, optionally, attached to the upper end thereof a flexible rim 8. In one embodiment, cylindrical support segment 7 is hollow as shown. Support segment 7 is closed by optical molding surface 10 circumferentially attached to the bottom of support segment 7. The curvature of molding surface 10 is selected in order to correspond with the optical requirements of the lens to be produced. The curvature may be entirely spherical, aspherical or combinations of both. Materials for constructing the mold parts are well documented in the literature, e.g., U.S.Patent No. 4,121,896, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as ifSsetAout in full text .Flexible female mold member 4 include a cylindrical support segment or wall 12 set in a base 14 set circumferentially thereto and an optical molding surface 16 set internally in cylindrical support segment 12. The internal diameter of female support segment 12 is somewhat larger than the external diameter of male support segment to properly accommodate the desired angle e which, for example, in a desirable embodiment can be in the range of from about 20 to about 80. As with the male molding surface 10, the curvature of female molding surface 16 is initially predetermined, and in operation can be varied in order to provide female molding surface 16 with the desired toric configuration.The principal longitudinal. axis of curvature of female mold member 4 is the y axis and the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of male mold member 7 is the y axis.The angle formed by these two axes, as illustrated previously, is i. The circumferential torque ring 6 is provided with two opposing set screws 18, in the embodiment illustrated, which when rotated inwardly, impinge on and deflect flexible female mold member 4. The torque ring 6 has an internal diameter which is slightly larger than the external diameter of cylindrical support segment 12 so that ring 6 may be conveniently removed and attached to female mold member 4 or removed from one mold member to another. The ring is preferably fabricated from rigid material such as metal, brass or the like. During the operation of the novel process in a first adjustment the configuration of the lower portion of the female mold portion is adjusted by impinging the set screws on the mold, then the lens forming material 20 which will eventually constitute the contact lens per se is placed into the female mold portion. Support segment 7 of male mold portion 2 is inserted into support segment 12 of female mold portion 4 and any excess lens forming material 20 is squeezed out between the annular like space between the two mold portions. It will be understood that in the embodiment shown in the Figures no runoff channels in the mold portions are shown or provided. Providing molds with such channels or other means for permitting excess lens forming material to be removed is within the scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment shown in Figures 2 and 3, the male mold portion 2 is provided with a circumferential flexible rim 22 around male molding surface 10. When the male mold portion 2 is urged against molding surface 16 of the female mold portion 4 the flexible rim 22 moves inwardly towards its principal longitudinal axis thus defining the edge of the lens thus molded. In a further embodiment not shown, female molding surface 16 rather than male molding surface 10 is provided with the circumferential flexible rim 22.In a broad aspect of the invention neither the female molding surface nor the male molding surface is provided with a circumferential flexible rim. Toric lenses thus prepared may have undesirable flashing or excess molded material at their periphery which can be removed by conventional means, e.g., machining and or polishing operations. It is further understood that various means, not shown in Figures 2 3, can be employed to retain the mold members in a fixed closed position thus preventing angle e from varying from its preset value, e.g., retaining the mold system in a press or vise so as to prevent movement of the mold members during the lens forming operation. Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment of the invention in which the male mold member 2 is inserted at a predetermined angle into the female mold portion.It will be understood that adjustment means not shown may be provided to further vary the angle e of insertion. In a further embodiment the angle G is predetermined and complementing mold pair portions are employed in which male mold portion 2 slidably fits into female mold portion 4. The process of molding is described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,208,365, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated by reference as if set out in full text. During the molding operation, the lensforming material may contract and the contraction may be as much as 20 of its volume originally present between the molding surfaces. If desired, slight external pressure can be applied, desirably on the male mold portion, to ensure that the molding surfaces do remain in contact with the lens forming material during contraction. However, the application of such external pressure is optional and, while in certain cases may give rise to improved results, the operation of the processes generally will proceed without added external pressure.After the molding step is completed, the molds are separated and the lens 24 shown in Figure 4 so produced is removed from the mold in a condition ready to use except for cleaning and perhaps a buffering of the edges. The optical surfaces of the lens are in their desired state. As shown in Figure 4 the lower portion of the lens 24 is thicker than the upper portion of the lens thus showing the prism ballast obtained by the practice of the invention. Included within the invention is the provision of single truncation lens 28 although a double truncation is also contemplated. Truncation is accomplished by mechanically removing a small portion of the lens defined by a portion of the outside radius of the lens and a chord between two points. The radius of the female mold portion 4 is adjusted by placing it into the circumferential torque ring 6 and adjusting the opposing set screws. The female mold member provides an optical surface to the resulting lens and a mold is selected or fabricated having the desired radius. The female mold portion 4 and attached circumferential torque ring assembly 6 are placed into a Keratometer and the set screws 18 are adjusted, optionally using a micrometer or other means, to vary the radius of the female mold portion 4 in both the horizontal and vertical plane with respect to the finished lens.As an example, starting with a spherical radius of 8.00 mm for the female mold surface 16, the mold portion 4 plus torque ring assembly 6 are placed in a Keratometer, the set screws 18 may be tightened to impinge on the female mold portion 4 to flatten the horizontal radius, to say 8.10 mm Åand steepen the vertical radius, to say 7.90 mm.Thus using predetermined radii in conjunction with a known base curve radius will result in known horizontal and vertical powers. The greater the radii differential the greater the difference between horizontal and vertical powers, hence the greater the cylinder. Another embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 5 which is similar to Figure 2. In Figure 5, adjustable screw means 23 are employed to secure male mold portion 2 in a fixed position once the desired angle e is attained. In another embodiment of the invention as shown in Figure 6 the male mold portion 2 is flexible and produces a toric configuration on the base or posterior surface 10 of the contact lens. The mold and molding procedure operates in substantially the same manner, subject to some minor variations, as will be apparent from the above description with respect to Figures 2 and 3. It will be understood that the number and placement of adjusting screws about the circumference of torque ring 6 may be varied depending upon the desires of equipment design and the exact shape of the lens to be fabricated. For convenience, two screws 18 are illustrated, one positioned directly across from the other. The molds are themselves preferably manufactured from thermoplastic materials, for example, low density polyethylene or polypropylene. These and other suitable materials are described in U.S. Patents 4,208,365 and 4,121,896, the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference as if set out in full text. The process of the invention is not limited to soft plastic contact lenses, i.e., hydrogels in their hydrated state, although these are preferred articles.Also included are the hard or rigid contact lenses as well as flexible, hydrophobic contact lenses. The novel process results in advantages over prior art methods in that a toric lens is cast directly from the desired lens forming material polishing of the optical surfaces is not required only minimum finishing of lens edges may be required and the overall manufacturing is far less labor intensive than with prior procedures, e.g., lathe procedure. More importantly, by the practice of the invention there is obtained, in an economic manner, a wide variety of toric contact lenses which exhibit a wide range of cylinder powers and significant positional stability in the eye of the wearer, i.e., prism ballast, previously available if at all by costly and timeconsuming machining and polishing techniques. The invention also includes as a novel article of manufacture a molded, toric shaped contact lens having a continuous smooth circumference, prism ballast, and cylinder. Preferably said novel article is a hydrogel, especially a hydrophilic polymer containing a major amount of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HE MA . The design of the lenses produced by the invention is not restricted to any particular set of parameters. Both anterior and posterior optical surfaces of the lenses may consist of aspherical curves. The central portion of the lens may consist of spherical curves on either or both the anterior and posterior surface, and the periphery of the anterior surface may consist of a steeper or flatter spherical curve, and the periphery of the posterior surface may be aspheric to achieve a combination of improved fitting characteristics. Any lens forming material can be employed in the novel process to fabricate contact lenses which have at least one surface which is toric in configuration.Such materials may be hydrophilic, or hydrophobic, or mixtures of both. The resulting contact lenses may be hard lenses as exemplified by the rigid acrylic plastics, most notably poly methyl methacrylate or such contact lenses may be flexible, hydrophobic lenses as exemplified by the unsubstituted and fluoro substituted polyethylenes, the silicone elastomers, etc. or such contact lenses may be the so called hydrophilic lenses desirably having a three dimensional structure such as polymers of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate the various hydrolyzed hydrophilic colla gen products, etc. The hydrophilic lenses are water insoluble, water swellable, and when immersed in water or saline solution swell to attain their final dimensions.The resulting water swollen lenses may be properly terrned hydrogel lenses. The following examples are further illustrative, but not limiting, of the present invention using the molding apparatus as illustrated in Figure 2. It will be appreciated that various polymerizable mixtures suitable for fabricating contact lenses and adjustment procedures, either to the female mold portion, as below, the male mold portion, or both, may be used.Unless otherwise indicated all parts and percentages are by weights EXAMPLE 1 A. A hydrophilic contact lens having a toric front surface was prepared using a a lens mold of poly propylene of the type described and illustrated in U . S . Patent No. 4,121,896, issued October 24, 1978 except that the internal diameter of cylindrical support segment 12 of female mold member 4 is somewhat larger than the external diameter of support segment 7 of male mold member 2 to properly accommodate the angle o as desires see Figure 2. The material used was composed substantially of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA , and due to the fact that the resulting polymer of HEMA swells in water or a physiologic solution by a factor of say 1.2, the wet lens that results is lesser in power by a factor of approximately 69 . The female mold selected had an optical curve spherical radius of 7.56 Ma, and a base curve radius of 7.08 mm, and a diameter of 10.8 mm. After selecting the proper mold sizes the torque ring was placed over the flexible female optical curve mold member and the adjustment screws tightened only to the point of contact with the mold. Next the assembly was placed in a Keratometer and the screws adjusted to flex the mold to have the desired radii, which in the present instance was a horizontal radius major of 7.63 mm and a vertical radius minor of 7.48 mm. The two torque screws were tightened evenly until the desired radii were observed. Having thus adjusted the flexible female mold member1 the assembly was removed from the Keratometer and charged with 1 ml. of a lens forming mixture having the following ingredients Component Parts by Weight 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate t 98.3 diethylene glycol monomethacrylate 0.8 ethylene glycol dimethacrylate 0.4 methacrylic acid in trace amounts plus other impurities 0.5Percadox 16 a 1.0 a Bis 4 tert.butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate Next the male base curve mold member with a radius of 7.08 mm was inserted into the adjusted, charged female optical curve mold member at an angle e of 30.That is tQ say, the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of the male member, inserted so as to be perpendicular to the major axis meridian on the resulting female toric molding surface, formed with the principal longitudinal axis of curvature of the female member an angle e equal to 30. The flexible rim portion of the male member and the optical surfaces of both the male and female member enclose and bound the lensforming mixture. The male mold member was maintained in a fixed position of tilt , i.e., angle e of 30, by means not shown in Figure 2. The inserted male mold member forced out a small amount of the lens forming mixture as well as any bubbles from the mold system.The mold system was placed in a circulating air oven at 1050 for approximately 30 minutes to polymerize the monomer. After polymerization and cooling,the mold members were separated and a hard, dry lens removed. The lens edge was buffered to remove any slight roughness. The finished contact lens was placed in a physiological solution. As measured on a Nikon Vertexometer, the lens had a major power wet of 4.50, a minor power wet of 3.50, a cylinder of 1.00, a toric front surface, and prism ballast of 0.5 diopter which insures significant positional stability when placed in the eye of the wearer. B. Example 1A is repeat except that the female mold selected had an optical curve spherical radius of 7.35 mm. The finished contact lens was placed in a physiological solution. As measured on a NikonVertexometer, the lens had a major power wet of 1.50, a minor power wet of G.50, a cylinder of 1.00, a toric front surface, and prism ballast of 0.5 diopter which insure5 significant positional stability when placed in the eye of the wearer.

EXAMPLE 10 Examples 2 5 are repeated except the following polymerizable mixture is used Component Parts by weight 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 65 N, dimethylacrylamide 35Water, distilled 30 diethylene glycol dimethyl ether 20 methylene bis acrylamide 0.3 diisopropyl percarbonate 0.3 After equilibration, the resulting toric lenses are substantially similar to those obtained in Examples 2 5 with respect to power and prism ballast. These lenses are characterized by significant positional stability when worn for customary periods of time. EXAMPLE 11 The general procedure of Example 6 is repeated using a two part room temperature vulcanizable transparent methyl silicone liquid which is mixed prior to adding 0,5cue of the resulting mixture into the receiving mold member. The male support segment is inserted displacing excess vulcanizable liquid. The two mold members are lightly pressed together to insure seating and perhaps some flexing of the flexible rim on the opposite molding surface. The mold system is placed in a circulating air oven at 1400C for 2.5 hours. After cooling, the mold is opened. There is obtained a lens with a toric front surface exhibiting cylinder and prism ballast as indicated in the previous Examples. Monomer,prepolymer or vulcanizable mixtures particularly useful in the practice of this invention include hydrophobic acrylic esters, suitably lower alkyl acrylic esters, the alkyl moiety containing 1 5 carbon atoms, such as methyl acrylate or methacrylate, ethyl acrylate or methacrylate, n propyl acrylate or methacrylate, isopropyl acrylate or methacrylate, isobutyl acrylate or methacrylate, n butyl acrylate or methacrylate, or various mixtures of these monomers.For increased dimensional stability and resistance to warpage the above monomers or monomer mixtures may be further admixed with a minor proportion of di or polyfunctional polymerizable species to cause cross linking of the polymeric matrix as polymerization proceeds. Examples of such di or polyfunctional species include divinylbenzene, ethylene glycol diacrylate or methacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate or methacrylate, and the acrylate or methacrylate esters of the following polyols triethanol amine, glycerol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Other cross linking monomers may include N,N methylene bis acrylamide or methacrylamide, sulfonated divinylbenzene, and divinyl sulfone. Further, the above monomers or mixtures thereof may be further mixed with linear polymeric species which are soluble therein as long as the viscosity of the solution or casting syrup formed thereby does not become sufficiently great that difficulty in removing bubbles therefrom is encountered. Other monomeric materials suitable for producing lenses via this invention are hydrophilic monomer mixtures forming three dimensional cross linked networks such as those disclosed in U.S. 3,822,089.Illustrative hydrophilic monomers include water soluble monoesters of an acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with an alcohol having an esterifiable hydroxyl group and at least one additional hydroxyl group such as the mono and polyalkylene glycol monoesters of methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, e.g., ethylene glycol monomethacrylate, ethylene glycol monoacrylate, diethylene glycol monomethacrylate, diethylene glycol monoacrylate, propylene glycol monomethylate, dipropylene glycol monoacrylate, and the like theN alkyl and N,N dialkyl substituted acrylamides and methacrylamides such as N methylacrylamide, N, N dimethylacrylamide, N methylmethacrylamide, N, N dimethylmethacrylamide, and the like N vinylpyrrolidone the alkyl substituted N vinyl pyrrolidones, e.g., methyltsubstituted N vinylpyrrolidone glycidyl methacrylate glycidyl acrylate and others known to the art. Also useful are the alkyl ether acrylates and methacrylates and the vulcanizable silicone fluids or elastomers. The alkyl moieties which are especially suitable in the aforementioned compounds are those which contain from 1 to 5 carbon atoms therein. With the hydrophilic monomer or mixtures thereof, it is preferred that a 3 dimensional cross linked network be formed. For this purpose it is desirable to employ small amounts of crosslinking monomers such as those illustrated above with respect to the discussion on hydrophobic acrylic esters or other cross linking technique, e.g., radiation. Preferred monomeric mixtures contain at least one alkylene glycol monoester of methacrylic acid, especially ethylene glycol monomethacrylate, and at least one crosslinking monomer such as the alkylene glycol diester of methacrylic acid, especially ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Such mixtures may contain other polymerizable monomers, desirably in minor amounts such as N vinylpyrrolidone, methyl methacrylate, acrylamide, N methacrylamide, diethylene glycol monomethacrylate, and others illustrated above. The polymerization reaction can be carried out in bulk or with an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include water organic solvents such as water soluble lower aliphatic monohydric alcohols as well as polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycol, glycerol, dioxane, etc. and mixtures thereof. In general, the solvent, if employed, can comprise a minor amount of the reaction medium, i.e., less than about 50 weight percent. Polymerization of monomer mixtures is usually carried out with free radical catalysts of the type in common use in vinyl polymerization. Such catalyst species include organic peroxides, percarbonates, hydrogen peroxides,and inorganic materials such as ammonium, sodium, or potassium persulfate. Polymerization using such catalysts may occur at temperatures between ambient temperature i.e., ca 200C and about 1200C depending on the speed of polymerization desired. Polymerization may also occur between monomer or prepolymer mixtures under the influence of elevated temperatures or radiation U.V., X ray, or other wellknown forms of radioactivity . With silicone elastomers, vulcanization may take place via a free radical curing mechanism, or, in the case of two part so called RTV compounds vulcanization may occur through displacement or condensation reactions.
