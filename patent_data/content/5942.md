## Abstract
A conveyor system of a type including a tube 53,54 , a cable 30 having discs 31 rigidly attached to and equally spaced along the cable 30 for conveying granular or powdery materials within the tube 53,54 has an improved drive unit 10 for causing and controlling the movement of the cable 30 and discs 31 through the tube 53,54 . It is characterised by having a driving wheel 13 with specially formed projections 20 to prevent the cable 30 from jumping off and means 36, 37, 39 46 for shutting off the power to the drive unit 10 when the cable 30 becomes too loose.
