# FOLDING FILM SHEETS

## Abstract
A fold line is formed in a semi rigid PVC or PVA sheet 1 by cutting a groove 17 approximately half way through the sheet. The cutter comprises a blade or a rotary sawblade or end milling cutter 7 positioned between a pair of idler rollers 13 and projecting beyond the peripheries of the idler rollers by a distance d which is half the sheet thickness. The cutter 7 removes PVC or PVA from the sheet 1 and thereby rapidly and efficiently forms a fold line that has no significant elastic memory sufficient to cause unfolding of, for example, a folding carton formed by folding the sheet.
