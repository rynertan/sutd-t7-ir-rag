# Gravel packing a well.

## Abstract
A system for gravel packing a zone of a well comprises an operating string 32 including a liner hanger setting tool 36 . A liner string 30 is concentrically disposed about the operating string and has its upper end detachably connected to a lower end of the liner hanger setting tool. The liner hanger setting tool includes a rotatable ball valve 272 disposed in a housing bore 202 thereof. The liner string and operating string are lowered together on an outer drill pipe string into the well until a liner hanger of the liner string is located at a desired location. Then the liner hanger is set 448, 482 within the well at a desired location in response to an increase in pressure within the outer tubing string. Then the ball valve of the liner hanger setting tool is opened in response to an increase in pressure within the well annulus. A concentric inner tubing string 760 is lowered through the outer pipe string, then through a ball valve bore 912 of the open ball valve and into operable engagement with an isolation gravel packer 70 of the operating string. Gravel laden slurry is directed down the concentric inner tubing string to a zone to be gravel packed, and return fluid returns through a tubing annulus between the concentric inner tubing string and the outer tubing string.
