# Adjustment assembly for a disc brake.

## Abstract
An adjustment assembly for a disc brake includes a nut 26 and a threaded stem 28 . The threaded stem 28 defines a first diameter portion 72 and a second diameter portion 76 which cooperate to form a differential area sealingly engaging an inwardly extending partition. The partition also forms a passage 88 to communicate fluid pressure to both portions 72, 76 so that the differential area and pressure communi cating passage are compactly arranged at the partition.
