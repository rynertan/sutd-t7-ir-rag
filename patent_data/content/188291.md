## Description
The present invention relates to an improvement in a bipolar semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the same. A selective epitaxial technique, which provides a high speed bipolar semiconductor device, has recently been attracting attention. The selective epitaxial technique is described in, e.g., N. Ohuchi et al., A New Self Aligned Transistor Structure for High Speed and Low Power Bipolar LSIs , IEDM Tech. Dig.,pp. 55 58, 1983. A method of manufacturing a bipolar transistor using the selective epitaxial technique will be described with reference to Fig. 1. N type buried layer 2 is formed in the surface of p type silicon substrate 1. CVD oxide film 3 is formed on the entire surface of the resultant structure. Film 3 is selectively etched to form openings 13 and 14. N type monocrystalline silicon layers are formed in openings 13 and 14 by selective epitaxy. The upper surfaces of the n type monocrystalline silicon layers are recessed to correspond to the forms of openings 13 and 14. During formation of the n type monocrystalline silicon layers, a polycrystalline silicon layer is formed on film 3. An n type impurity is selectively ion implanted in the monocrystalline silicon layer formed in opening 13 to form n type collector connection region 5. A thermal oxide film is formed on the surfaces of the monocrystalline silicon layers and the polycrystalline silicon layer on film 3. A silicon nitride film is then formed on the thermal oxide film. Photoresist is applied to the entire surface of the resultant structure, which is then etched by reactive ion etching. Thus, the thermal oxide film, the silicon nitride film and the photoresist are left only on the recessed portion of layer 4. Etching back of this type is described in S. Shibata et al., A Simplified BOX Buried Oxide Isolation Technology for Megabit Dynamic Memories , IEDM Tech. Dig., pp. 27 30, 1983. Boron is ion implanted in the n type epitaxial layer in opening 14 and in the polycrystalline silicon layer on film 3 in the vicinity of the n type epitaxial layer to form p type graft base 6. The polycrystalline silicon layer on film 3 is etched so that a prospective base emitter region near the second opening and a prospective collector connection region near the first opening are electrically isolated. Annealing is performed to activate impurities in regions 5 and 6. Selective oxidation is then performed by using as a mask the remaining silicon nitride film, thus forming thermal oxide film 7. The silicon nitride film and the underlying thermal oxide film are removed. Emitter, base, and collector electrodes 10, 11, and 12 are thus formed. When the above selective epitaxial technique is used to manufacture a bipolar transistor, the base region of the transistor can be made small, thereby decreasing base resistance. As a result, transistors manufactured with the above method are capable of high speed and high frequency operation. In transistors capable of high speed operation, an impurity must be doped at a high concentration in region 5. This is to decrease the resistance of region 5, thereby reducing the overall collector series resistance of the transistor. In the above method, it is preferable that annealing for forming region 5 be performed at as low a temperature as possible to maintain a high emitter collector breakdown voltage. To form region 5 having a high impurity concentration and reaching layer 2, annealing must be performed at a temperature of about 1,000 to 1,100 C for several to tens of minutes. When such high temperature annealing is performed, however, the impurity is diffused from layer 2 and redistributed, thereby decreasing the emitter collector breakdown voltage of the transistor. Region 5 as mentioned above is formed with the following steps 1 a monocrystalline silicon layer is formed by selective epitaxy 2 an n type impurity is selectively ion implanted in the monocrystalline silicon layer 3 part of the polycrystalline silicon layer on film 3 is removed 4 the monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon layers are patterened to be isolated and 5 the resultant structure is annealed. These steps are necessary because an impurity is diffused at a considerably high rate in the polycrystalline silicon layer formed on film 3 Therefore, when annealing is performed, n type impurity may be diffused in the base region. The polycrystalline silicon layer is removed to prevent this. However, the above mentioned steps 1 to 5 are complex in procedures, and productivity suffers. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device having a high emitter collector breakdown voltage and capable of high speed operation, and a method of manufacturing the same. In order to achieve the above object, a bipolar transistor silicon conductor according to the present invention comprises a semi conductor substrate 21 of a first conductivity type, a buried layer 22 of a second conductivity type selectively formed in a surface region of the semiconductor substrate 21 , at least one insulating film 23, 25 formed on the semiconductor substrate 21 and having at least two openings 27, 30 on the buried layer 22 , a conductive layer 29 formed in at least one opening 27 of the at least two openings 27, 30 of the insulating film 23, 25, 26 , directly connected to the buried layer 22 and consisting of one or polycrystalline silicon in which an impurity of the second conductivity type is diffused, a high melting point metal, and a silicide of a high melting point metal, a monocrystalline silicon layer 31 of the second conductivity type formed in at least one the other opening 30 of the at least two openings 28, 30 of the insulating film 23, 25, 26 and connected directly to the buried layer 22 , a region 36, 37 of the first conductivity type selectively formed in the monocrystalline silicon layer 31 , and a region 38 of the second conductivity type selectively formed in the region 36, 37 of the first conductivity type. A method of manufacturing a bipolar transistor according to the present invention comprises the steps of According to the semiconductor device and method of manufacturing the same according to the present invention, the impurity cannot be diffused from the buried layer 22 into the monocrystalline silicion layer 31 . Therefore, the emitter collector breakdown voltage of the obtained semiconductor device is not decreased, and the emitter collector series resistance of th semiconductor device can be decreased, enabling high speed operation. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 2 to 13. In Figs. 2 to 12, polycrystalline silicion portions are dotted to distinguish them from monocrystalline silicon portions. By the above mentioned steps, a semiconductor device is obtained which has p type semiconductor substrate 21 n type buried layer 22 formed in a surface region of substrate 21 insulating films 23, 25, and 26 formed on substrate 21 and having openings 27 and 30 n type polycrystalline silicon layer 29 buried in opening 27 and directly connected to buried layer 22 n type monocrystalline silicon layer 31 buried in opening 30 and directly connected to buried layer 22 p type layers 36 and 37 selectively formed in layer 31 and serving as a base and n type layer 38 selectively formed in layers 36 and 37 and serving as an emitter. The bipolar transistor manufactured in the above steps has polycrystalline silicon collector connection region 29. Polycrystalline silicon has a high rate of impurity diffusion. Therefore, phosphorus can be doped in layer 29 in a short diffusion time at temperatures below 900 to 950 C, thereby keeping the collector resistance low. After formation of region 29, all that remains is the annealing process, which can be performed under the moderate conditions required for low temperature selective oxidation for forming film 35 and impurity diffusion for forming the base and emitter . Impurity redistribution from layer 22 to layer 31 rarely occurs. As a result, even if layer 31 has a thickness as small as 1 to 2 µm, a high emitter collector breakdown voltage can be maintained. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the present invention, characteristics of semiconductor devices 1 and 2, obtained by conventional methods, and semiconductor device 3, obtained by a method according to the present embodiment, were compared. Semiconductor device 1 was manufactured under the following conditions and its impurity concentration was measured. A p type silicon substrate having a surface crystal orientation of 100 was prepared. A buried layer in which Sb was diffused at a concentration of about 10¹⁹ cm³ and has a resistivity of 20 Ω cm and a depth of 3 to 4 µm was formed in the surface of the p type silicon substrate. N type epitaxial layers monocrystalline silicon layers having an impurity concentration of about 3 x 10¹⁵ cm³, a resistivity of 1.5 to 2.0 Ω cm, and a thickness of 1 µm were formed on the buried layer for connection with a collector and forming a transistor. An n type impurity was diffused in the monocrystalline silicon layer for connection with the collector. For this purpose, POCℓ₃ was reacted with oxygen at a temperature of 1,000 C in a gas phase and decomposed so that phosporus was doped in the monocrystalline silicon layer. Annealing was then performed to diffuse the phosphorus. Distances from the surface of the monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor and impurity concentrations thereof after epitaxy and annealing were measured to obtain a relationship therebetween. The results are shown in Fig. 14. In Fig. 14, the solid line represents Sb concentration profile after epitaxy immediately after formation of monocrystalline silicon layer for deriving a transistor and the broken line represents impurity concentration after doping the n type impurity in the collector connection layer. As shown in Fig. 14, the impurity concentration profiles observed after the two processes are different. More specifically, when the impurity is diffused into the monocrystalline silicon layer for connection with the collector, the impurity in the buried layer is rediffused into the monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor. Note that the same result was obtained when an impurity was ion implanted into the monocrystalline silicon layer for connection with the collector and then diffused at a temperature of 1,000 C. A silicon substrate was prepared under the same conditions as semiconductor device 1. Monocrystalline silicon layers identical to those for device 1 were formed on the semiconductor substrate. An impurity was diffused from a PSG or P AsSG film at a temperature of 1,100 C into the monocrystalline silicon layer for connection with a collector, so that diffusion could be performed without distortion. Distances from the surface of the monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor and impurity concentrations thereof after the impurity diffusion for forming collector leads were measured to obtain a relationship therebetween. The results are shown in Fig 15. In Fig. 15, the solid line represents impurity concentration after epitaxy and the broken line represents impurity concentration after doping the n type impurity in the collector connection layer. As shown in Fig. 15, the impurity concentrations after the two processes are different. More specifically, when the impurity is diffused into the monocrystalline silicon layer for connection with the collector, the impurity in the buried layer is rediffused into the monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor. In a bipolar transistor according to this embodiment, a collector connection layer is formed before a monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor. The impurity is thus not rediffused from the buried layer into the monocrystalline silicon layer. Emitter collector breakdown voltages of semiconductor devices 1 to 3 were compared to obtain the results shown in the Table below. As apparent from the Table above, it is difficult to guarantee operation at 5 V of Emitter Coupled Logic ECL comprising a bipolar transistor obtained with conventional methods. However, with the present invention, even if the epitaxial layer monocrystalline silicon layer has a thickness as thin as 1 µm, operation at 5 V of ECL is guaranteed. Hence, even if the monocrystalline silicon layer has a thickness of only 1 µm, a transistor capable of operating at the so called TTL level can be obtained. If the impurity is even slightly diffused from layer 22 into layer 31, the collector breakdown voltage of the semiconductor device is greatly influenced. In a conventional semiconductor device, impurity rediffusion into the monocrystalline silicon layer occurs when a transistor is formed therein. In contrast to this, in the method according to the embodiment of the present invention, a collector connection layer is formed before the monocrystalline silicon layer for forming a transistor. Only moderate annealing must be performed thereafter. With the semiconductor device and the method of manufacturing the same according to the embodiment of the present invention, the collector series resistance can be reduced without decreasing the collector breakdown voltage. Note that in the above embodiment polycrystalline silicon is used to constitute a collector connection region. However, the present invention is not limited to this. If desired, high melting metals such as Mo, Ti, and W resistant to high temperature annealing under about 1,200 C or silicides thereof can be used. When these alternative materials are used, it may be difficult with RIE to guarantee the same etching speed as for the resist in the process for etching photoresist R2 and the material, shown in Fig. 5 . In this case, a selective CVD technique can be used. The selective CVD technique is described in, e.g., T. Moriya et al., A Planar Metallization Process Its Application to Tri level Aluminum Interconnection , IEDM Tech. Dig., pp. 550 553, 1983. With the selective CVD technique, an alternative material can be selectively buried in opening 27. In the above embodiment, CVD oxide film 26 is formed on polycrystalline silicon film pattern 24, and polycrystalline silicon film 28 is formed thereon. However, film 26 may be replaced by a thermal oxide film. The conductivity types of respective portions of the semiconductor are not limited to those employed in this embodiment. P and n type conductivities can be exchanged to obtain the same effect. In the embodiment, single emitter and single collector type transistor is disclesed. Not limited to this, this invention can apply to multi emitter and multi collector type transistor.
