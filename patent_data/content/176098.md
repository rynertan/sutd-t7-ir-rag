## Description
DIGITAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a digital transmission system. More particularly, it relates to a digital transmission system employed, for example, in an integrated service digital network ISDN for transmitting data via a single transmission line under a full duplex communication mode. 2. Description of the Related Art In a known digital transmission system operated under the full duplex communication mode, a highly accurate timing recovery operation must be achieved to maintain a good quality transmission data, and echo must be completely suppressed for the same reason. The abovementioned second requirement is especially pertinent to a digital transmission system operated under an echo suppression method or echo cancellation method , but is not so important in a digital transmission system operated under a time compression method, i.e., the so called ping pong method. This is because, in the ping pong method, a send signal from a transmitter unit in a transmitting receiving unit cannot inherently leak into a receiver unit in the same, as it can in the echo suppression method. Namely, in the above digital transmission system, interference in the timing recovery operation is usually caused by an echo signal originating from a send signal output by that system, and interference in the echo suppression operation is usually caused by a signal received from a remote transmitting receiving unit. In the prior art transmitting receiving unit, a measure for maintaining the high quality of transmission data is directed only to a reduction of the echo signal to a level as low as possible, to attain a more accurate timing recovery. For example, the related echo suppression circuit often called an echo cancellation circuit, but hereinafter referred to as an echo suppression circuit works under a certain algorithm to bring the echo signal to a level of almost zero at each sampling point. In this case, even though each sampled echo signal level is reduced to nearly zero, the remaining echo signals, which have not been sampled, are left as they are, i.e., at a relatively high level. The thus non sampled echo signals often reach a level as high as the levels of the received signals.Under such circumstances, it is very difficult for the related timing recovery circuit to achieve a really accurate timing recovery operation, since the received signals used for that operation contain undesired non sampled echo signal components. Consequently, the problems occurring in the prior art are, first, a large number of the sampling points must be used, and second, the timing recovery circuit must be operated in accordance with a complicated algorithm. These above mentioned first and second measures are not suitable for practical and commercial use from an economical viewpoint. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a digital transmission system, operated under a full duplex communication mode and an echo suppression method, in which a highly accurate timing recovery operation can be performed without employing special hardware or using a special algorithm. A further object of the present invention is to achieve a complete echo suppress ion operation in the system without employing special hardware or using a special algorithm. To attain the above objects, the digital transmission system according to the present invention incorporates at least a timing control means and a transmission control means the timing control means being operative to synchronize an internal clock of a trans mitting receiving unit with a received signal applied thereto during every predetermined term and the transmission control means being operative to inhibit the issue of a send signal from the transmitting receiving unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Before describing the embodiments of the present invention, the technical background thereof and problems therein will be first described with reference to the related figures. Further, for ease of comprehension, the following explanations will be primarily made on the basis of an integrated service digital network ISDN . Figure 1 is a general block diagram of a conventional digital transmission system to which the present invention pertains. In Fig. 1, the basic construction of the system includes a master side transmittingreceiving T R unit 10 and a slave side T R unit 20 connected thereto by a single two wire transmission line 30. The master side T R unit 10 is mounted in an exchange office and includes therein a master clock source 18. The master clock is given to respective circuits via a clock distributor 19. The slave side T R unit 20 is mounted at a subscriber side and includes therein a slave clock source 28. The slave clock is given to respective circuits via a clock distributor 29.In this case the slave clock is subordinate to the master clock. When a send data SD1 is to be supplied by the T R unit 10 to the T R unit 20, the send data SDl in the T R unit 10 is applied to a hybrid transformer 12 via a drive circuit 11, where a four wire to two wire conversion is established to form a connection with the transmission line 30 and the send data SD1 is then transmitted, as a send signal, to the slave side T R unit 20. It should be understood here that there are many separate T R unit pairs linked between the exchange office and the subscribers via individual transmission lines. Conversely, when a send data SD2 from the slave side T R unit 20 is to be transmitted via the transmission line 30 and applied to the master side T R unit 10, the thus received signal at the master side T R unit 10 is input, via the hybrid transformer 12, to a subtractor 14. The subtractor 14 cooperates with an echo suppression circuit 13 to suppress any echo signal superimposed on the received signal. As is well known, the echo signal is a part of the send signal leaked via the hybrid transformer 12, along the path shown by a broken line arrow in Fig. 1, due to a mismatching in impedance at the hybrid transformer 12 with respect to the transmission line 30.Therefore, the echo signal can be suppressed in a receiver part of the T R unit 10 by applying, from a transmitter part thereof, the send signal SD1 to the subtractor 14 by way of the echo suppression circuit 13, which matches the send signal level with the leakage send signal level via the hybrid transformer 12. Therefore, theoretically, the received signal given from the subtractor 4 contains no echo signal. The received signal is then applied to an equalizer 15 to compensate for various distortions given to the received signal transmission along the line 30.The thus equalized signal is applied to a discriminator 16 to obtain logic 1 and 0 signals. The 1 and 0 signals are supplied to a timing recovery circuit 17 to extract therefrom a clock component and then reproduce the send data SD2 as the received date RD1, by sampling the 1 and 0 signals with the use of the extracted clock component. The above mentioned operations are also applied to the slave side T R unit 20 when the signal SD2 is transmitted and a signal RD2 is received. Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D depict waveforms of signals for explaining the echo suppression circuit 13.Figure 2A depicts the echo signal given to the echo suppress ion circuit 13 same as for a echo suppress ion circuit 23 . The echo signal 5e is sampled with a sampling signal Sp , shown in Fig. 2B, to produce a so called replica. The replica is negatively added to the echo signal leaked from the hybrid transformer 12 at the subtractor 14 to obtain the zigzag shaped signal shown in Fig. 2D. In Figs. 2D and 2A, the curve SR represents the received signal. As apparent fromFig. 2D, the echo signal is suppressed to zero only at every sampling point, but left as it is at portions other than these sampling points, and the thus unsuppressed echo signal impedes correct timing recovery. A similar problem to that mentioned above is also raised during the echo suppression operation. The echo suppression circuit 13 same as for the echo suppression circuit 23 is made of, for example, a known transversal type filter provided with taps for determining coefficients. The tap coefficients are adaptively determined in accordance chiefly with the degree of the mismatching in impedance at the hybrid transformer 12 with respect to the transmission line 30. In this case, however, it is difficult to correctly determine each value of the tap coefficients, since a mixture of the echo signal and the received signal not the echo signal only , is used for the determination. Figure 3 is a block diagram of a master side transmitting receiving unit according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 3, members identical to those of previous figures are represented by the same reference numerals or symbols as for later figures .Figure 4 is a block diagram of a slave side transmittingreceiving unit according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Figures 5A, SB, 5C, and 5D depict timing charts of signals appearing in the units shown inFigs. 3 and 4. Figures 5A and 5B depict the send signal and and the received signal SR1 , both at the master side, respectively. Similarly, Figs. 5C and 5D depict the send signal Ss2 and the received signal SR2 , both at the slave side, respectively. The operation for transmitting data at the master side transmitting receiving T R unit 40 will be explained below with reference to Figs. 3 and 5A. TheT R unit 40 produces a send signal Ssl composed of successive frames each having a period T. One of these frames is illustrated in Fig. 5A. The frame is set up with a frame pulse FP, a timing pulse TP, and the send data SD1, in this order. The frame pulse FP is generated by a frame pulse generator 41. The timing pulse TP is generated from a timing pulse generator 42. The frame pulse FP, the timing pulse TP, and the send data SD1 are selected one by one sequentially at a selector 43 to produce therefrom the send signal Ssl. The selection is made by a sequence controller 44.The sequence controller 44 also controls the selector 43 to create a non signal duration Td. Thus the selector 43 and the sequence controller 44 form a transmission control means. The thus set up send signal SS1 is given to the hybrid transformer 12 via a unipolar bipolar U B converter 45 and the aforesaid drive unit not shown . In the master side T R unit 40, the aforesaid timing recovery circuit is not incorporated because the timing recovery operation is not always necessary, since the T R unit 40 has its own master clock source 18 and the master clock is supplied to each circuit via the clock distributor 19. In actuality, however, although the timing control for the frequency is not always necessary, the timing control for the phase preferably should be performed. This is because a transmission delay is not constant but slightly variable, due to various factors such as a change in temperature, a change in characteristics due to an elapse of a long term, and so on. The send signal SS1 is thus produced from the master side T R unit 40 and transmitted, via the transmission line 30, to the slave side T R unit 50 of Fig. 4 with a certain delay time At Fig. SD . The thus received signal SR2 is depicted in Fig. 5D. The signal SR2 includes therein data to be reproduced later as the received data RD2. The content of RD2 is the same as that of SD1. It should be understood that the arrangement of the circuits in the slave side T R unit ofFig. 4 is opposite relative to the arrangement of the circuit in the slave side T R unit of Fig. 1. In the slave side T R unit 50 of Fig. 4, the received signal SR2 is applied, via a subtractor 24, an equalizer 25, and a discriminator 26, to a synchronizing circuit 56 in which an internal clock of the T R unit 50 is synchronized with the received signal Sir2 , in accordance with the frame pulse FP contained in the signal SR2. Subsequently, a sequence controller 54 activates the timing recovery circuit 27 to extract the clock component from the received signal 5R2 in accordance with the timing pulse TP contained therein. The sequence controller 54 then also controls the echo suppression circuit 23 and a selector 53. The selector 53 is controlled by the controller 54 to produce the send signal SS2 composed of the successive frames one of which is illustrated in Fig. 5C and set up with a frame pulse FP and the send data SD2 in this order. The frame pulse FP is generated by a frame pulse generator 51. The controller 54 also controls the selector 53 so that a non signal duration is created in the period T. Thus the selector 53 and the sequence controller 54 form both a timing control means and a transmission control means. The thus set up send signalSS2 is given to the hybrid transformer 22 via a unipolarbipolar U B converter 55 and the aforesaid drive unit not shown . The send signal SS2 is thus produced from the slave side T R unit 50 and transmitted via the transmission line 30, to the master side T R unit 40 of Fig.3 with a certain delay time At Fig. 5B . The thus received signal 5R1 is depicted in Fig. SB. This signal SR1 includes therein the data to be later reproduced as the received data RD1. The content of RD1 is the same as that of SD2. That is the received signal SR1 is applied to the subtractor 14, the equalizer 15, and the discriminator 16, so that the received data RD1 is obtained. The point is that the transmission control means, e.g., the selector 43 and the sequence controller 44 at the master side, operates in such a manner as to insert the timing pulse TP in each frame having the period T, while, at the slave side, the transmission control means, e.g., the selector 53 and the sequence controller 54, operates to inhibit an issue of the send signal Ss2 and at the same time, at the slave side, the timing control means, e.g., the sequence controller 54, controls the timing recovery circuit 27 to start the related timing recovery operation only during the inhibition of the issue of the send signal SS2. Accordingly, in the slave T R unit 50, it is possible to perform the timing recovery with the use of the received signal only, in the form of the timing pulse TP, without an echo signal being generated inside the T R unit 50.This means that a stable and accurate timing recovery operation can be carried out. Figure 6 illustrates a more detailed example of the synchronizing circuit and the timing recovery circuit in cooperation with the sequence controller shown in Fig. 4.Figure 7A through 7D depict the waveforms appearing at the portions A through D shown in Fig. 6, respectively.The synchronizing circuit 56 is comprised ot a frame pulse detecting circuit 61, a frame synchronization counter 62, and a frame synchronization back up circuit 63. The timing recovery circuit 27 is comprised of an upper side comparator 64, a lower side comparator 6b, anOR gate 66, an AND gate, a digital phase locked loop DPLL circuit, and the aforesaid slave clock source 28. The discriminator 26 of Fig. 4 produces the discriminated logic 1 and nO signals, which appear at the portion H in Fig. 6. These signals have the waveform as shown in Fig. 7H in response to the wavetorms of Fig.7A representing the aforesaid signals RD2, FP, and TP.The signal at the portion H is input to the frame pattern detecting circuit 61 by which tfle frame pattern, including the frame pulse FP, is detected. When the frame pattern is detected, a detection output is produced therefrom having the wavetorm of Fig. 7B and applied to both the trame synchronization back up circuit 63 and the frame synchronization counter 62, to start the related counting operation. When the counter 62 completes the counting of a predetermined count number, it produces a end pulse appearing at the portion C having the waveform ot Fig. 7C. The end pulse is given to the circuit 63. The predetermined count number is, for example, 160 or 168 which corresponds to the bit number composing each frame having the period T. The frame synchronization back up circuit 63 determines whether or not the frame pulse detection is established. Specifically, when the circuit 63 receives the detection outputs from the circuit 61 several times in succession, the circuit 63 determines that the frame synchronization is correctly established. Soon after this, the circuit 63 sends a command, via a line L3, to the counter 62 for starting the counting operation. The correct establishment of the frame synchronization is informed, via a line L4, to the sequence controller 54.Then the controller 54 is activated. The controller 54 preferably can be made of a read only memory ROM which stores therein various data specifying the related control sequence written thereinto in advance. That is, the controller 54 issues command signals, at the portionsI, J, and K, on lines Ll and L2, both shown also in Fig.4. The command signals at the portions I and J are given to the selector 53 with the waveforms of Figs. 7I and 7J, respectively. The command signal at I indicates the start of an issue of the frame pulse FP, and the command signal at J indicate the start of an issue of the send data SD2 Before the issue of FP and SD2, the command signal at K is given to the echo suppression circuit 23 Fig. 4 for activating the same to adjust the tap coefficients adaptively at Td. . In accordance with the above mentioned sequence control by the controller 54, the slave side T R unit 50 can achieve the timing recovery operation with the use of the transmitted timing pulse TP and without generating an echo signal which would, if generated, impede an establishment of an accurate timing recovery, as mentioned previously. For this, the sequence controller 54 produces a clock window signal appearing at the portion D with the waveform of Fig. 7D and applies it to the AND gate 67 to open the same. On the other hand, the output from the equalizer 25 is applied to the comparators 64 and 65 at the portion A, with the waveforms of Fig. A and compared in level with reference voltages V and V independently. The upper and lower side comparators 64 and 65 are responsible for the positive and negative pulses of the bipolar output shown in Fig. 7A, respectively. Theoretically, either one of these comparators can derive the clock component. In actuality, however, two some parators are preferable to obtain a larger two times number of the compared outputs than that obtained with the single comparator. The compared outputs from the comparators 64 and 65 are Opted at the OR gate 66 and the resultant output at the portion E is applied to the aforesaid AND gate 67, which output has the waveform ofFig. 7E. Among many clock components from the comparators 64 and 65, only the clock component defined by the timing pulse TP is selectively extracted by the clock window signal D at the AND gate 67.The thus extracted clock component cannot be influenced by the echo signal, since the send data SD2 causing the echo signal is not transmitted until the timng pulse duration has elapsed. This means that a pure clock component is supplied from the AND gate 67, and accordingly, theDPLL circuit 68 is driven by the pure clock component derived from the received signal. Thus, the slave clock from the slave clock source 28 is subordinated in synchronization to the received signal SR2. In other words, the internal clock of the slave side T R unit 50 is synchronized with the received signal SR2 , so that a pulled in output clock appears at the portion G.The aforesaid said sampling makes easy to simplify the construction of the echo suppress ion circuit 23 than does usual echo suppression circuit, since the echo suppress ion circuit 23 is controlled with the use of the related echo signal only in the non signal duration Td shown in Fig. 5D, in which no received signal SR2 exists but only the echo signal caused by the send signal SS2 exists. The received non signal durationTd of Fig. 5D is the same as the transmitted non signal duration Td of Fig. 5A. The non signal duration Td is determined such that the next transmitted pulses FP and TP can be received at the slave side after the trial of the skirt made with the echo signal refer to the hatched area in Fig. 5C induced by the send data SD2. It should be noted that the master side T R unit 40 can also pertorm the timing recovery, if necessary. In this case, the timing recovery operation should be achieved in the non signal duration Td of Fig. SA. This is because the duration Td contains no echo signal induced by the send data SD1, but only the received signal SR1. Therefore, the timing recovery in the master side T R unit 40 also can be performed stably and accurately. Furthermore, it should be noted that, in the slave side T R unit 50 of Fig. 4, the training pulse TP duration can be utilized for performing a line equalization by the equalizer 25. The echo signal also causes a deterioration in the line qualization. Therefore, it is preferable to achieve the line equalizing operation in the non single duration Td , since no such deleterious echo signal exists in the duration Td t and thus a stable and adaptive line equalization can be realized. Figure W is a block diagram of a master side transmitting receiving unit according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Figure 9 is a block diagram of a slave side transmitting receiving unit according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Figure 10A, lOB, 10C, and 10D depict timing charts of signals appearing in the units shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Figures 10A through 10D correspond to Figs. SA through 5D, res pectlvely. That is, Figs. 10A and 10B depict the send signal Ssl and the received signal SR1 , both at the master side, respectively.Similarly, Figs. 10C and 10D depict the send signal Ss2 and the received signal SR2 both at the slave side, respectively. It should be understood that the frame pulse FP and the timing pulseTP are not illustrated integrally as one piece in Figs. 10A through 10D, as shown in Figs. 5A through 5D. This difterence in illustration is not important, but merely for facilitating an understanding of the echo signals illustrated with hatchings. The operation for a transmission at the master sideT R unit 70 will be first explained below with reference to Figs. 8 and 10A. The members 76 and 74 are substantially the same as the synchronizing circuit 56 and the sequence controller 54 both shown in Fig. 4 , respectively. The frame pulse generator 41, the timing pulse generator 42, the selector 43, and the sequence controller 74 cooperate with each other to produce the send signal SS1 shown in Fig. 10A, as in the first embodiment of Fig. 3 with the corresponding members 41, 42, 43, and 44. That is, the frame pulse FP, the timing pulse TP and the send data SD1 are set up, as the send signal Ss1 , in this order. Further, a non signal duration Tdd is also created in the period T of each frame.The difference between the duration Tdd ofFig. 10A and the corresponding duration Tdd ot Figs. SA and 5D is that, in the second embodiment, the duration Tdd is composed of two successive durations T and r Tt. The duration Tr is determined to be equal to twice the trasnmission delay time of the transmission signal from the master side unit to the slave side unit and vice versa. The duration Tt 15 determined to have enough time to accept the timing pulse TP transmitted from the slave side T R unit 80. The thus set up send signal Ssl is transmitted, via the unipolar bipolar converter 45, the hybrid transformer 12, and the transmission line 30, to the slave side TIR unit 80. At this time, the echo signal, induced by the signal S51 leaks into the own side receiver part, as mentioned previously. In the present invention the thus induced echo signal is used tor adaptively adjusting the echo suppression circuit 13, especially with the use of the echo signal derived from at least the timing pulse TP first occurrence in Fig. 10A by means of the sequence controller 74 which cbntrols, on one hand, the selector 43 to produce the timing pulse TP, and on the other hand, controls the echo suppression circuit 13 to start the adaptive adjustment tor suppressing the echo signal.it should be recognized that the adaptive adjustment can be carried out with a high degree of accuracy, since the echo suppression circuit 13 is no longer influenced by any received signal 5R1 given from the slave side T R unit 80. The send signal SS1 from the master side T R unit 70 reaches the slave side T R unit 80 with a certain delay time equal to Tr 2 and is received thereby as the received signal SR2 with the waveform shown inFig. 10D. The signal SR2 is applied, via the subtractor 24, the equalizer 25, and the discriminator 26, to the synchronizing circuit 56 in which the internal clock of the T R unit 80 is synchronized with the received signal SR2 , in accordance with the frame pulse FP contained in the signal SR2. Then, with the use ot the thus synchronized internal clock, the sequence controller 54 is activated to control the selector 53 such that, as shown in Fig. 10C, the trame pulse FP first occurrence , the send data SD2, and the timing pulse TP are produced in this order. The pulses FP and 1s are generated by the respective generators bl and 52 and produced, together with the send data SD2, one by one under control of the controller 54. Also, the non signal duration Tdd Fig. 10C is created. The duration Tdd is identical to the duration Tdd of Fig.10A, and thus, composed of the durations Tr and Tt. The thus formed send signal S sus2 is transmitted, via the transmission line 30, to the master side T R unit 70, and at the same time, the echo signal, induced by the send signal SS2 , leaks into the own side receiver part with the waveform with the hatchings as illustrated inFig. 10D. In this case, the adaptive adjustment of the echo suppression circuit 23 is achieved by using the echo signal under the control of the sequence controller 54 every time the timing pulse of Fig. 10C is produced.Therefore, the circuit 23 is not intluenced by a received signal SR2 , which no longer exists as shown in Fig. 10D. The thus formed send signal Ss2 is transmitted, via the converter 55, the hybrid transformer 22, and the transmission line 30, to the master side T R unit 70, with a certain transmission delay time equal to Tr 2 from the slave side T R unit 80 to the master side T R unit 70. The thus received signal SR1 refer to Fig. 10B at the master side T R unit 70 is applied, via the subtractor 14, the equalizer 15, and the discrminator 16, to the synchronizing circuit 76 in which the internal clock of the T R unit 70 is synchronized in phase with the received signal SR1. Then, with the use of the thus synchronized internal clock in phase, the sequence controller 74 starts activating the timing recovery circuit 17 in order to establish a timing recovery, with the use of the received timing pulse TP shown in Fig. 10B. At this time, no echo signal exists in the master side T R unit 70, which means that the timing recovery can be performed with high degree of accuracy. Alternatively, in the master side T R unit 70, the timing recovery operation also can te achieved not only by using the training pulse TP Fig. 10B , but also the received data RD1 signal itself appearing in the duration T r of Fig. 10A. This is because there is no echo signal in the duration Tr In this case, the use of the signal RD1 for the timing recovery is possible under a condition that the bit amount ot the signal RD1 is sufficient to achieve the timing recovery. In other words, the condition is that wherein the duration T is relatively long, i.e., the slave side T R r unit 80 is located far from the master side T R unit 70. Further, in the slave side T R unit 80, the timing recovery operation can be achieved with not only the received timing pulse TP of Fig. 10D, as in the abovementioned way for achieving the same, but also the frame pulse FP of Fig. 10D. According to this measure, the reliability of the timing recovery can be more improved than that of the aforementioned way, with the use of the timing pulse TP only. As mentioned above, in the second embodiment of the present invention, the timing recovery operation is achieved in not only the slave side T R unit 80, but also in the master side T R unit 70, by means of the timing recovery circuits 27, both shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In the previously explained first embodiment of the present invention, however, this timing recovery circuit is not incorporated in the master side T R unit 40 Fig. 3 , but in the slave side T R unit only as shown by the reference numeral 27 in Fig. 4. Therefore, the master side T R unit according to the present invention is susceptible to phase deviation of the received signal Ssl due to a change in the transmission characteristics of the transmission line 30. From this viewpoint, the first embodiment is inferior to the second embodiment. Contrary to this, however, the first embodiment is superior to the second embodiment from the viewpoint of transmission efficiency, which is simply clarified by comparing the length of the non signal duration Td Fig. 5A in the first embodiment with that of the non signal duration Tdd Fig. 10A in the second embodiment. This stems from the fact that, of course, each frame should deliver the send data in as large an amount as possible, i.e., the non signal term Td , Tdd should be as short as possible. Figure 11 is a general block diagram of a digital transmission system according to a modified first embodiment of the present invention. The system is constructed with a master side T R unit 110, a slave side T R unit 12o, and the transmission line 30. A block 111 represents a master side transmission device, i.e., all of the circuits comprising the T R unit 40 ofFig. 3. A block 121 represents a slave side transmisssion device, i.e., all of the circuits comprising the T R unit 50 of Fig. 4, other than timing reocvery circuit 27. A block 112 represents a phase component extraction means, and a block 122 represents a frequency component extraction means. The basic functions of timing recovery circuits 117 and 127 are the same as those of the timing recovery circuits 17 and 27 shown inFig. 1, respectively.The slave side T R unit 120 is supplied with the received signal SR2 and the frequency component FR is extracted from the signal SR2 with the aid of the frequency extraction means 122. The trequency component FR is input to the timing recovery circuit 127 so as to synchronize the slave side internal clock from the source 28 with the received signalSR2 regarding both the frequency and the phase, whereby the timing recovery is performed. On the other hand, the master side T R unit 110 is supplied with the received signal SR1 given from the slave side, and the phase component PH is then extracted trom the signal with the aid of the phase extraction means 112.The phase component PH is input to the timing recovery circuit 117 so as to synchronize the master side internal clock from the source 18 with the received signal SR1 It should be noted that the timing recovery operation in the circuit 117 is achieved only during a reception of a training signal TR. The training signalTR is used for initiating the timing recovery operation every time data transmission is to be started. According to the modified first embodiment, first, the timing recovery operation is achieved in the slave side T R unit 120 with the use of the received signalSR2 given from the master side T R unit 110, whereby the timing recovery is performed with the use of the frequency component FR extracted by the means 122. In this case, the phase component necessarily is also extracted based on the frequency component. Thus the recovered timing signal is obtained at the slave sideT R unit 120. Soon after this, a phase adjusting signal is returned to the master side T R unit 110. The phase adjusting signal is synchronous with the thus recovered timing signal. The master side T R unit 110 is supplied with the returned phase adjusting signal, so that the timing recovery is started in the master side T R unit 110 by using the same.It should be noted here that the timing recovery in terms of the frequency at the master side T R unit 110 is identical to that appearing at the slave side T R unit 120. This is because the timing signal recovered at the slave sideT R unit 120 is derived from the received signal SR2 given from the master side T R unit 110. However, the timing signal regarding the phase necessarily varies in accordance with the transmission characteristics. Therefore, in the master side T R unit 110, the timing recovery is performed, not for the frequency component but for the phase component only, at the timing recovery circuit 117 with the aid of the phase extraction means 112. Figure 12A through 12D depict waveforms of the signals for explaining the timing recovery performed in the master side T R unit 110. The slave side Tz R unit 120 is first supplied with the received signal SR2 and then the phase adjusting signal is returned to the master side T R unit 110, as the received signal SR1.The signal SR1 is applied to an equalizer identical to the equalizer 15 of Fig. 3, so that the equalized output is produced theretrom with the waveform lj shown in Fig.12A. The output is then applied to a discriminator identical to the discriminator 16 of Fig. 3, in which the output is compared in level with positive and negative threshold levels TH and TH , respectively.Thus, the compared output is obtained with the waveform 16 shown in Fig. 12B. As mentioned before, the training signal TR is used for initiating the timing recovery evey time data trasnmission is to be started. The signal TR is shown in Fig. l2C. The signal TR is issued at the time tl and ends at the time t2. In other words, the term from tl to t2 exists for a phase adjustment.The timing recovery circuit 117 of Fig. 11 operates to adjust the phase so as to synchronize in phase the internal clock, i.e., the master clook 18 , with the received signal S during the reception of the signalTR. The difference in phase therebetween gradually changes to zero, as schematically shown by 81 8, 838 in Fig. 12D. When the training signal TR is stopped at the time t2, no further input is applied to the timing recovery circuit 117. Accordingly the phase in the circuit 117 is locked after the time t2 PHASR LOCR with the phase adjusted immediately before the stoppage of the signal TR. Incidentally, an initial training operation is also achieved in the slave side, as does in the master side. Figure 13 illustrates a more detailed example of the timing recovery circuit together with the phase extraction means at the master side T R unit 110 shown in Fig. 11. Figures 14A through 14D depict timing charts for explaining the operation of thecircuit shown in Fig. 13. In Fig. 13, reference numeral 130 represents a 1 2 frequency divider, 131 a selector, 132 an AND gate, 133 a 1 N frequency divider, 134 a differentiation circuit, 135 a 1 2 frequency divider, 136 an AND gate, and 137 a switch. The 1 2 frequency divider 130 produces the divided output pulses 01 and 00 with the waveforms shown inFigs. 14A and 14B, respectively. Before an issue of the training signal TR, a certain output S is determined according to an individual condition of the related circuit and is produced from the 1 2 frequency divider. In response to the output S, the selector 131 now selects, for example, the s61 side output pulse, and therefore, the output X from the selector 131 exhibits the waveform shown in Fig. 14F. The character X denotes an inversion in level with respect to an output pulse 0 00 or 01 . The selected output X is input to the AND gate 132 and allowed to pass therethrough as an output C2 Fig. 141 by an inverted gate input I.The gate output I is shown in Fig. 14H. The output C2 is applied to the 1 N frequency divider 133, where the number N is preferably equal to 48. The thus frequency divided output CO from the divider 133 is supplied, via a line L6, to the master transmission device 111. The waveform of the output C is shown in Fig. 14G. 0 When the training signal TR is generated in the master side T R unit 110, the signal TR makes the switch 137 ON. Therefore the output from the discriminator starts being supplied to the difterentiation circuit 134.The thus difterentiated output is represented by, for example, D in Fig. 14D. The output D is applied, on one hand, to the 1 2 frequency divider 135, and on the other hand, to the AND gate 136. When the output D is high level, the AND gate 136 is closed thereby. Every time two successive outputs D are given to the 1 2 frequency divider 135, the divider 13s changes the level of its output S, as shown at the middle of Fig. 14E. In response to the output S now changed to high level, the selector 131 changes the selection of the output pulse from 01 to 00. On the other hand, the AND gate 136 produces the gate output I at a high level in resonse to the output D inverted to a high level at the input of the AND gate 136. The thus obtained gate output I is inverted to a low level at the input of the AND gate 132 and closes this gate 132. Therefore, the first of the output pulses, now the 60 side output pulses selected by the selector 131, is inhibited from passing through the gate 132, as schematically illustrated by the pulse 00 indicated by a broken line in Fig. 14I.This means that the output CO is lagged in phase, since the one output pulse 00 is not given to the divider 133, and thereby the internal clock is synchronized in phase with the received signal SR1. Inversely, where the output Fig. 14C trom the discriminator exists and, at the same time, the output CO Fig. 14G is low level at the time the differentiated output D is to be produced, the pulse 00 is not inhibited to pass through the AND gate 132. In this case, accordingly, the output CO is led in phase, due to the existence of the first output pulse 0 corresponding to the broken line pulse shown in Fig. 141 . When the above mentioned phase adjustment is completed, i.e., the phase difference i4 of Fig. 12D reaches almost zero, generation of the training signalTR is stopped. Therefore the switch 137 is made OFF by the stoppage of the signal TR, and no further output from the discriminater is supplied to the differentiation circuit 134.Thus, the status of the selector 131 at the end of the phase adjustment is maintained as is after the time t2 of Fig. 12D, so that either 00 or 01 from the divider 130, determined by the last status of the selector 131, is supplied to the divider 133 to produce CO as a timing recovery output having a desired phase and the thus determined output CO is, supplied, from now on, to the master transmission device 111 to maintain a usual data transmission. it should be noted that the relationship in timing explained with reverence to Fig. 5 is still satisfied even in the term of the phase adjustment.That is, when the master side T R unit 110 achieves the above mentioned timing recovery with the use of the received signal SR1 , a send signal Ssl does not exist in the master side T R unit 110.This means that the timing recovery is not influenced by an echo signal which would be induced by the signal SS1 , and thus a highly accurate timing recovery can be attained. Returning again to Figs. 3, 4, 8, and 9, the frame pulse generator 41 and the timing pulse generator 51 will be explained in detail below. The frame pulse FP can be composed of a 6 bit train, for example, lOOOOM , and the timing pulse TP also can be composed of a 4 bit train, for example, 0110 . The character M denotes a bit, the logic of which changes to 1 and O alternately in sequence for every frame. Figure 15 is a detailed example of the frame pulse generator. The frame pulse generator 41 is constructed as a presettable shift register. That is, the generator 41 is comprised of a load register 141, a parallel serial P S shift register 142 and a flip flop 143. According to the above example, the logic 10000 of the 5 bit train is loaded in advance in the load register 141. The 6 bits are set all at once in the P S shift register, together with the bit M supplied from the flip flop.Then the 6 bit train is produced bit by bit, in synchronism with a clock CLK1 to obtain the trame pulse FP. The flip flop is triggered by a clock CLK2. The clockCLK2 has the same period as that of the frame, i.e., T of Fig. 5A. Therefore, logics 1 and O are generated, as the bit M, alternately, at every frame. Although the clock CLK1 is the same as the internal clock. It should be understood that the timing pulse generator 42 also can be constructed in a similar manner to that of the above mentioned crane pulse generator 41, but the content of the load register 141 and the M bit position should be modified so as to conform with the bit train composing the timing pulse TP. Further it is also possible to form these generators 41 and 42 integrally as one body, by using a 10 6 4 bit P S shitt register and a load register which stores therein both the sets of the aforesaid 6 and 5 bit trains. Regarding the frame pulse FP and the timing pulse TP, it is possible to cancel the timing pulse TP. In this case, the frame pulse is utilized as the timing pulse TP simultaneously. This conception can be applied to the aforesaid embodiments, however, some changes must be effected in the receiver part. Figure 16 is a circuit diagram of a modified receiver part to be operated with the frame pulse FP only. It should be understood that although Fig. 16 shows the modified slave side receiver part as an example, the related modification also can be effected in the master side receiver part in a similar way to that of Fig. 16. Figures 17A through 17F depict waveforms of signals appearing in Fig. 16 at the portions A through F, respectively. Figure 16 corresponds to the previously explained Fig. 6, and therefore, some members used in the circuit of Fig. 6 also are used in the circuit of Fig. 16. The received signal SR2 is applied to the equalizer 25 to produce the equalized signal with the waveform of Fig. 17A. The output from the equalizer 25 is applied to both the comparators 64 and 65 to produce, via the OR gate 66, the compared output with the waveform of Fig. 17B.The output at the portion B is applied to, on one hand, a flip flop FF 151 and, on the other hand, to the AND gate 67. The flip flop 151 momentarily holds logic 1 or O of the compared output from the OR gate 66 in synchronism with the internal clock CLK, which is identical to the output clock from the digital phase locked loop D.PLL circuit 68. A trame synchronizing circuit 152 receives the output from the flip flop 151 and produces therein a frame pulse detection signal with the waveform ofFig. 17C. In response to the frame pulse detection signal, the circuit 152 creates a clock window pulse with the waveform of Fig. 17D.It should be noted that the clock window pulse illustrated in Fig. 17D is created in response to the frame pulse detection signal which has been generated immediately before the occurrence of the detection signal illustrated in Fig. 17C. Once the frame synchronization is established by the circuit 152, it is easy to find the frame pulse detection signal Fig. 17C . This is because each frame pulse FP has the same bit pattern as each other, and further, the frame pulses are given periodically with a constant time interval T. The above mentioned clock window pulse is used to allow the predetermined edge portion refer to EDGE inFig. 17B of the frame pulse FP to pass through theAND gate 67 selectively. In other words, the clock window pulse inhibits the compared output corresponding to the received data RD2 to pass through the AND gate 67.This is because it is impossible to extract the clock component from the compared output of RD2, since the RD2 signal has deleterious jitter due to an inter symbol interference. The jitter is schematically illustrated by double lines at the leading and falling edges of each compared output pulse shown in Fig. 17B. The thus passed edge portion via a line L7 and theAND gate 67 is input to a delay circuit 153 through which a predetermined delay time dt is given to the edge portion to obtain a delayed edge portion with the waveform of Fig. 17E. The delay is important to make the rising edge of the edge portion coincide with the center of each compared output. Thus, a virtual timing pulse is obtained which is synchronized with the rising edge of the delayed edge portion, and therefore, the virtual timing pulse can hit each center of the received data pulse, and therefore, a highly accurate timing recovery can be expected since the aforesaid jitter portions are excluded.Based on the above mentioned fact, a desired output clock refer to Fig. 7F is obtained which is correctly synchronized with the virtual timing pulse derived from the frame pulse per se, with the aid of the DPLL circuit 68 driven by the output pulse E from the delay circuit 153. In this case a certain problem may arise in that it is difficult to synchronize the DPLL circuit 68 with the output pulse E promptly, since the pulse E is not generated continually, but periodically. The above mentioned problem, however, can be overcome simply by, for example, shortening the frame period T or by increasing the number ot edge portions in each trame pulse FP adaptively. As explained above in detail, in the digital transmission system of the present invention, the timing recovery and the echo suppression can be performed with a high degree ot accuracy without employing special hardware or using special algorithm.
