## Description
This invention relates to a novel process for producing a cyclic alcohol by catalytic hydration of a cyclic olefin. Conventionally known processes for producing cyclic alcohols by hydration of cyclic olefins include processes of indirect or direct hydration using highly concentrated mineral acids, particularly sulfuric acid. Other homogeneous catalysts that have been proposed for the reaction include aromatic sulfonic acids, as described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 8104 68 and 16123 68, heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid, as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 9746 78 the term OPI as used herein refers to an unexamined published application , and the like. However, when these homogeneous catalysts are used, the desired cyclic alcohol is present in the catalyst system and is difficult to separate and recover. Also, side reactions may occur to an extent which is more than negligible. Thus, separation and purification of the desired cyclic alcohol becomes difficult. In addition, regeneration of catalysts is impossible once they are deteriorated. In order to overcome these defects, it has been proposed to use solid catalysts, for example, ion exchange resins as described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 15619 63 and 26656 69. Such ion exchange resins, however, have the problem of reduction in size of the resin by mechanical disintegration, and problem of reduction in catalytic activity due to insufficient heat resistance of the resin. Thus such ion exchange resins are incapable of providing stable catalytic activity over a long period of time. Thus, the above described conventional processes, when applied to hydration of cyclic olefins, fail to achieve industrially sufficient catalytic activity, and require elevation of the reaction temperature for attaining an industrially satisfactory reaction rate. However, the hydration of cyclic olefins is an exothermic reaction, and the proportion of cyclic alcohols to cyclic olefins in the equilibrium composition decreases with increasing temperature. Therefore, a rise in the reaction temperature brings about reduction of concentrations of the desired cyclic alcohols, which necessitates a high cost for separation and recovery of cyclic alcohols. In addition, a rise of the reaction temperature leads to an increase of not only the hydration rate of cyclic olefins but also a conversion of cyclic alcohols to by products due to isomerization and the like, resulting in reduction of selectivity to the desired reaction. As a result of extensive investigations to solve the above described problems, it has now been found that hydration of cyclic olefins can proceed with conspicuously increased activity and selectivity lasting for a prolonged period of time, as compared with the conventional processes, by using, as a catalyst, a crystalline aluminosilicate containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium. That is, the present invention relates to a process for producing cyclic alcohols by catalytic hydration of cyclic olefins, which comprises using, as a catalyst, a crystalline aluminosilicate containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium. The attached drawing illustrates an example of a flow sheet for practicing the present invention, wherein numeral 1 designates a feed pipe, 2 a feed pipe, 3 a reactor, 4 a discharge pipe, 5 a liquid liquid separator, 6 a discharge pipe and 7 a recycle pipe. One of the features possessed by the present invention lies in that crystalline aluminosilicate containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium shows high catalytic activity for the hydration of cyclic olefins, thus making it possible to obtain cyclic alcohols in a high yield as compared with conventional crystalline aluminosilicates that show only very low activity. Another feature of the present invention is to suppress side reactions. For example, when cyclohexene is used as a cyclic olefin, possible side reactions include isomerization to methylcyclopentenes, e.g., 1 methylcyclopentene, 3 methylcyclopentene, 4 methylcyclopentene, etc. These isomerized methylcyclopentenes are in turn converted to methylcyclopentanol, etc., upon hydration. Moreover, there are noted formation of high boiling substances by polymerization of cyclohexene to a dimer or oligomer Most of these side reactions are due to the lability of cyclic olefins which are scarcely or never observed in the case of reactions of straight chain olefins. By the use of the specific catalyst according to the present invention, such side reactions are strikingly suppressed. This suppression effect significantly inhibits reduction of catalytic activity with time, and, as a result, makes it possible to maintain high activity and high selectivity for an extended period of time. The crystalline aluminosilicate containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium hereinafter simply referred to as metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate which can be used in the present invention is a crystalline aluminosilicate in which at least one member selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium hereinafter referred to as titanium Ti , etc. is physically or chemically bonded to the crystalline aluminosilicate through ionic bonding, covalent bonding or coordinate bonding,and include those wherein two or more of titanium, etc., are bonded to one active site of a crystalline aluminosilicate. The mechanism accounting for the high activity exerted by such a crystalline aluminosilicate containing titanium, etc., has not yet been clarified, but it is assumed that new active sites for hydration are formed on the crystalline aluminosilicate in such a manner that titanium, etc., is included in the active sites. Further, when water and organic materials are copresent in the reaction system, as in the case of the present invention, a crystalline aluminosilicate, in general, preferentially adsorbs water or the cyclic alcohols produced, thereby suppressing adsorption of the second component, i.e., cyclic olefins. At the same time, dehydration of the cyclic alcohols, which is the reverse of hydration, proceeds, resulting in reduction of the rate of hydration. On the other hand, the heat of adsorption of cyclic olefins onto titanium, etc., that form the active sites in the present invention is considerably higher compared with the heat of adsorption of cyclic olefins onto other elements. Accordingly, in the catalyst of the present invention, the active sites in which titanium, etc., take part are assumed to accelerate selective adsorption of cyclic olefins on the catalyst, and thereby greatly improve efficiency of the hydration. Therefore, the catalyst employed in the present invention exhibits high activity even under a condition wherein liquid phase water is present in the reaction system. When a powder type catalyst is used in the present invention, dispersibility of the catalyst in water can be improved. This appears to be ascribable to enhanced compatibility with water as well as to the above mentioned enhanced capability of adsorbing cyclic olefins. In the case wherein cyclic olefins having large molecular sizes are used as reactants, the rate of diffusion of such olefins in micropores of the crystalline aluminosilicate used as a catalyst is low due to their large molecule size, in marked contrast to straight chain olefins. As a result, it appears that acid sites inside the catalyst do not substantially participate in the reaction. This may also be surmised from the fact that reaction rates of the hydration reaction of cyclic olefins conducted in the presence of the conventional crystalline aluminosilicates are much slower than those of straight chain olefins. As a result of measurement of external surface acid sites acid sites outside micropores and total acid sites according to a pulse adsorption method, described hereinafter, it has been found that, as compared with the crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst containing no metal such as titanium, the metal containing catalyst according to the present invention has a remarkably increased number of external surface acid sites, while the total acid sites of these aluminosilicates being substantially equal. In other words, the latter has a larger population ratio of external surface acid sites to total acid sites than the former. The effect of the present invention can be explained by this larger population of external surface acid sites as well as by the fact that the hydration of cyclic olefins proceeds at the external surface of the catalyst. On the other hand, when straight chain olefins having a small molecular size were subjected to hydration in the presence of the metal containing catalyst according to the present invention, the results obtained were substantially equal to those obtained using the catalyst containing no metal. Besides, a process using straight chain olefins as reactants, e.g., Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 70630 84 suggests from page 163, column 4, line 7 up to page 164, column 1, line 4 that the catalyst which can be used may contain a monovalent alkali metal ion or a polyvalent metal ion. However, neither working example thereof nor the effects brought about by the use of such a catalyst is described therein. Hence, the effect of the present invention using cyclic olefins as reactants can not be expected from the prior art. As a result of further investigations, it has also been found that the activity of the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate in hydration of cyclic olefins can be enhanced in the presence of an acid in an aqueous solution thereof. The above fact is a surprising finding that has never been predicted. That is, the acid in the form of its aqueous solution seems to achieve a synergistic effect at a concentration that does not per se produce any hydration activity. This synergistic effect cannot be fully accounted for by a mere sum of the effects produced by each of the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate and the acid in an aqueous solution thereof. The reasons for the increased activity of the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate in the presence of an acid in an aqueous solution thereof are not clear, but may possibly be as follows. Firstly, protons of an acid in the aqueous solution thereof are supposed to be coordinated to the non covalent electron pair of oxygen atoms on the surface of the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate. An electron attractive effect by this ccordination may increase acid strength of the catalyst. Secondly, in the case of using an inorganic compound which acts as a Lewis acid, the above described effect can be manifested even with a low acidity in an aqueous solution. From this fact, it is assumed that direct mutual interaction between the hydration active sites of the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate and the Lewis acid molecules induces formation of new hydration active sites having high activity to thereby increase the affinity for olefins and to greatly increase the hydration activity. The catalysts that can be used in the present invention can be obtained by incorporating a metal, such as titanium, etc., in known crystalline aluminosilicates by treating with sources for such a metal. The crystalline aluminosilicates that can be used as catalyst precursors include mordenite, faujasite, clinoptilolite, chabazite, erionite, ferrierite, L type zeolite, ZSM type zeolite made by Mobil Oil Corporation and other pentasil type zeolite. Among them, pentasil type zeolite is effective. In particular, pentasil type zeolite prepared by using a lower alkylurea or a lower alkylthiourea as a template, as described in Japanese Patent Application No. 188165 84, produces good results ensuring the effect of the present invention. The lower alkylurea is represented by the formula wherein one or two of R₁, R₂ and R₃ each represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, with the rest being a hydrogen atom. Preferred examples of the lower alkylurea include methylurea, 1,3 dimethylurea, 1,1 dimethylurea, ethylurea, 1,1 diethylurea, 1,3 diethylurea, n propylurea, isopropylurea, 1 methyl 1 ethylurea, 1 methyl 3 ethylurea, etc. The lower alkylthiourea is represented by the formula wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are as defined above. Preferred examples of the lower alkylthiourea include methylthiourea, 1,3 dimethylthiourea, 1,1 dimethylthiourea, ethylthiourea, 1,1 diethylthiourea, 1,3 diethylthiourea, n propylthiourea, isopropylthiourea, 1 methyl 1 ethylthiourea, 1 methyl 3 ethylthiourea, etc. Incorporation of a metal in these catalyst precursors can be effected by any known methods, such as a method in which the crystalline aluminosilicate is immersed in an aqueous solution of a compound of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, or thorium at room temperature or under heating to thereby exchange and or adsorb titanium, etc., a method in which a mixture of an aqueous solution or slurry of the above described compound of titanium, etc., and a crystalline aluminosilicate is evaporated to dryness, a method comprising contacting the above described compound of titanium, etc., with a crystalline aluminosilicate in an organic solvent, and the like. Examples of the compounds of titanium, etc., which can be used in the present invention include titanium halides, titanium nitrate, titanium sulfate, and titanates as titanium sources zirconium halides, zirconium nitrate, and zirconium sulfate as zirconium sources hafnium halides, hafnium nitrate and hafnium sulfate as hafnium sources chromium II chloride, chromium II sulfate, and chromium III nitrate as chromium sources molybdenum VI oxide and ammonium molybdate as molybdenum sources tungsten V chloride as tungsten sources and thorium nitrate, thorium chloride, and thorium sulfate as thorium sources. The aqueous solution or aqueous slurry of these metal compounds which can be used for treating the crystalline aluminosilicate preferably has a concentration of from about 0.001 to 20 by weight, and more preferably from 0.01 to 10 by weight. The same conditions are preferably applied to the treatment using an organic solvent. The treatment according to the immersion method is carried out at from room temperature to 100 C, and preferably from room temperature to 80 C, under atmospheric pressure. The treatment according to the evaporation to dryness method is carried out at from 40 C to 100 C, and preferably from 60 to 100 C, at atmospheric pressure. The treatment may also be effectively conducted at high temperatures under pressure. In the case of effecting the treatment in water, the metal compound may be converted to substantially different compounds due to reactions, such as hydrolysis. Further, the product obtained by these treatments may be subjected to after treatment, such as ion exchange, washing with water, drying, calcination, reduction, and the like. In the catalysts which can be used in the present invention, the chemical species or existing state of the metal, such as titanium, etc., present therein is not particularly limited, but it is preferred that titanium, etc. be present in the form of its cation, hydroxide, oxide or metal. The amount of the metal to be incorporated in the crystalline aluminosilicate preferably ranges from about 0.002 to 5.0 mol Kg i.e., mole per kilogram , more preferably from 0.004 to 2.0 mol Kg, and most preferably from 0.01 to 1.0 mol Kg, in terms of mole number of an element per unit weight of the catalyst. The crystalline aluminosilicate, after being treated with the metal compound, may contain a proton or other cations. It is also effective that all the active sites which participate in hydration become active sites in which titanium, etc. take part in. The molar ratio of silica to alumina in the crystalline aluminosilicate which can be used as a catalyst precursor is not particularly restricted, but is preferably 10 1 or more, and more preferably 20 1 or more. If the molar ratio of silica to alumina is high, the acid strength of acid sites that are active sites of the hydration reaction increases, and, in contrast, the amount of the acid sites is remarkably reduced. Therefore, the usual upper limit of the silica to alumina molar ratio is about 300 1, and preferably is 100 1. The population ratio of external surface acid sites to total acid sites in the crystalline aluminosilicate used in the present invention is not particularly restricted. However, cyclic olefins that are used in the present invention have a relatively larger molecule size than straight chain olefins. As a result, the rate of diffusion of the cyclic olefin into the inside of the crystalline aluminosilicate particles is expected to be smaller irrespective of whether the reaction is performed in a gaseous or liquid phase. The influence of the large molecule size of cyclic olefins is particularly pronounced in a liquid phase. In other words, the activity of the catalyst according to the present invention is believed to depend predominantly on the population of external surface acid sites acid sites outside micropores . Accordingly, it is effective to use a crystalline aluminosilicate having a relatively larger population ratio of external surface acid sites to total acid sites in number, preferably of not less than 0.02, more preferably of not less than 0.05, and most preferably of not less than 0.2. The incorporation of titanium, etc. in a crystalline aluminosilicate serves to increase acid sites on the external surface of the aluminosilicate to thereby conspicuously increase active sites in number. This effect can be exhibited in treating not only crystalline aluminosilicates having small ratios of external surface acid sites but also those having larger ratios of external surface acid sites. The catalysts prepared by treating crystalline aluminosilicates having large populations of external surface acid sites with titanium, etc., have great significance in industrial production of cyclic alcohols. The kind of cation species exchangeable in the crystalline aluminosilicate which can be used in the present invention is not particularly limited. However, it is most effective to use the catalyst after proton exchange. In the present invention, the catalyst may have any form, such as a powder, granules, molded articles having specific shapes, and the like. In the case of using molded articles, alumina, silica, titania, etc., may be used as a carrier. The acids which can be used in the present invention are substances which exhibit acidity when mixed with water. The acids may be modified during reaction due to hydrolysis, pyrolysis, etc., as long as they show acidity in an aqueous solution thereof. The acids which can be used include inorganic compounds which act as Brønsted acids, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, molybdic acid, tungstic acid, heteropoly acid, etc. inorganic compounds which act as Lewis acids, such as halides of aluminum family elements, transition metal halides, transition metal sulfates, transition metal complexes, etc. carboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc. and organic sulfonic acids, such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc. The term Brønsted acid as used herein means a protic acid, i.e., a proton donating acid, and the term Lewis acid as used herein means an aprotic acid. These acids can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. The acid is present in the reaction system in an aqueous solution thereof. If the acid concentration is too high, separation and recovery of the reaction product becomes very difficult. If the acid concentration is too low, the acid strength as an aqueous solution is insufficient. Accordingly, the acid concentration employed in the present invention is preferably in the range of from 0.001 to 5 mol l, more preferably from 0.005 to 2 mol l, and most preferably from 0.01 to 1 mol l, though varying depending on the type of the acid. When the acid in the form of an aqueous solution thereof at the above specified concentration is used alone as a catalyst without using the metal containing crystalline aluminosilicate, hydration activity is scarcely exhibited. In the cases when dicarboxylic acids, such as succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, etc., are used as acids, they are preferably used at a concentration of from 0.5 to 5 mol l, and more preferably from 1 to 5 mol l. The cyclic olefins which can be used in the present invention preferably include cyclic olefins having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples thereof are cyclopentene, methylcyclopentenes, cyclohexene, methylcyclohexenes, cyclooctene, cyclododecene, and the like. The reaction is carried out in a commonly employed manner, such as a fluidized bed system, a batch system with stirring, a continuous system, and the like. Low reaction temperatures are advantageous in view of equilibrium of the hydration of cyclic olefins and suppression of side reactions. On the other hand, high reaction temperatures are advantageous from the standpoint of reaction rate. In the present invention, the reaction temperature usually ranges from 50 to 250 C, preferably from 60 to 200 C, and more preferably from 70 to 160 C, though depending on the type of the cyclic olefins used. The reaction pressure is not particularly restricted, and the cyclic olefin and water may be present in either a gaseous phase or a liquid phase. In particular, when water is present in a liquid phase, it is generally the case that the catalyst is surrounded by water in the neighborhood of its active sites, causing reduction of the reaction rate. The reaction in accordance with the present invention particularly shows its effectiveness in such a case. A molar ratio of the cyclic olefin to water can be selected from a broad range and also varies depending on whether the reaction is carried out continuously or batchwise. Nevertheless, too high a proportion of the cyclic olefin or water to other reactants is not practical because the reaction rate decreased. Accordingly, the molar ratio of the cyclic olefin to water, when reacted, e.g., in a batch system, preferably falls within the range of from 0.01 to 100, and more preferably from 0.03 to 10. The weight ratio of the cyclic olefin to the catalyst, when reacted in a batch system, preferably ranges from 0.005 to 100, and more preferably from 0.05 to 10. The reaction time is preferably from 3 to 300 minutes, and more preferably from 10 to 180 minutes. The reaction system may contain, in addition to the cyclic olefin and water, an inert gas, e.g., nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, argon, carbon dioxide, etc., an aliphatic saturated hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, an oxygen containing organic compound, a sulfur containing organic compound, a halogen containing organic compound, and the like. Thus, according to the present invention, a cyclic alcohol can be produced from a cyclic olefin by catalytic hydration with high conversion and selectivity as compared with conventional processes by using a crystalline aluminosilicate containing at least one member selected from titanium, zirconium, hafnium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and thorium as a catalyst, and the reactivity can be retained for a prolonged period of time. The present invention is now illustrated in greater detail by referring to the following Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In these examples, the population of external surface acid sites acid sites outside micropores and total acid sites were measured according to the following pulse adsorption method. A gas chromatography, GC 7A, and a data processing apparatus, CR 1A both made by Shimadzu Seisakusho Ltd. , were used as measuring equipment. A sample 0.2 g to 1 g was loaded in a stainless Steel made column of 4 mm in inside diameter and 80 mm in overall length, and the column was mounted to a sample side flow path placed in a thermostatic chamber of the gas chromatograph. Helium gas was introduced into the column as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 50 ml min. and, at the same time, the temperature within the chamber was increased to 325 C by heating. Two hours after heating, adsorption procedure was initiated. Portions of a definite amount 0.2 to 2 µl of an amine pyridine, 4 methylquinoline, or tributylamine were intermittently injected at definite intervals 2 minutes to 5 minutes through an injection opening on the sample size flow path using a microsyringe. At the other end, the carrier gas having traveled through the column was analyzed using a FID flame ionization detector to obtain a chromatogram showing periodical peaks of amine. With the increase in the number of the injection, the amount of adsorbed amine approaches near to a saturation level, and the amount of non adsorbed amine increases. Thus, in the above mentioned chromatogram, peak area S wherein W in grams represents the weight of a sample. In the present invention, injection was repeated n times at which S S₀ 0.98, and the amount of adsorbed amine, A µmol g , was calculated according to the following formula The population ratio of external surface acid sites to total acid sites of a particular crystalline aluminosilicate was determined as follows. That is, in micropores of the crystalline aluminosilicate, when the maximum micropore diameter is represented by a From measuring the population ratio, R, a combination of pyridine and tributylamine was used in Examples 8 and 9 and Comparative Example 2, and a combination of pyridine and 4 methylquinoline was used in the other Examples and Comparative Examples.
