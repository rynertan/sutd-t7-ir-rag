# Process for the preparation of tertiary aralkyl urethanes and process for the preparation of isocyanates derived therefrom.

## Abstract
Production of tertiary aralkyl isocyanates, such as tetra methyl xylylene diisocyanates, by thermal cracking of cor responding olefins and carbamic acid esters at moderate temperatures and in the presence of acid catalyst.
