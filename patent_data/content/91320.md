# Turning control apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling a turning operation in which a workpiece, rotated by a spindle, is cut by a cutting tool transported axially of the spindle in synchronization with the rotation thereof. The rotational speed of the spindle is sensed prior to the start of cutting, and the tool position axially of the spindle is corrected prior to the start of cutting based on the sensed rotational speed. Alternatively, once the rotational speed of the spindle has been sensed, a correction based on the sensed speed can be effected in the position at which a signal indicative of one spindle revolution is generated. The signal acts as a start signal to initiate cutting of the workpiece.
