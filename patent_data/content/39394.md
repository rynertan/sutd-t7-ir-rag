# Sound hood with glare shield for a typewriter or the like.

## Abstract
The sound hood has a transparent section 18 , which lays over the opening in the top of the typewriter for con straining the sound vibrations within the typenwriter, and a glare shield 20 which is adjustable about pivot axis 58 of section 18 . The entire assembly is pivotally mounted on two pivot arms 26 , which are attached to the top cover of the typewriter and which allow section 18 to be pulled forward and pivoted out of closing relationship with the typewriter. As section 18 is pulled forward, pivot arms 26 relieve a force on an extension 70 of frictional bushing 54, 60 , thus allowing the latter to rotate under the influence of the weight of glare shield 20 , thus lowe ring glare shield 20 down onto section 18 . As section 18 is replaced over the opening of the typewriter, pivot arms 26 reengage extension 70 on friction bushing 54, 60 pushing it back to its initial position. If glare shield 20 has not been moved relative to friction bushing 54, 60 glare shield 20 will be erected to the position pre viously selected by the operator.
