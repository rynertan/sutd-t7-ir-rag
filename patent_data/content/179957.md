# Universal contoured parts holding fixture.

## Abstract
A universal apparatus 10 for holding contoured work pieces in a selected pre determined contour during the performance of various manufacturing operations is dis closed. The apparatus 10 comprises a spring metal frame 14 supported by a base 13 which through the activation of computer programmable linear actuator members 16 can be deformed to a desired pre determined contour to form a contoured support plane for a work piece. The spring metal frame, portion of the apparatus further comprises means for indexing 21 22 the contoured work piece in the contoured support plane formed by the deformed spring metal frame 14 . The spring metal frame is also provided with constraining means which comprise a plurality of spaced vacuum cups 25 which are selectively activated to secure the work piece to the metal frame.
