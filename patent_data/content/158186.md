## Description
This invention relates to a light quenchable thyristor device which can be utilized in a device for converting a direct current or voltage of a large electric power to an alternating current or voltage. It is already well known that a thyristor device is driven with a light and is extensively practiced in the name of an LASCR or a Light Activated Thyristor. It is generally said that, in a large electric power converting device by using a thyristor, the perfect separation of the large electric power part and control circuit from each other is realized by making the thyristor operable by triggering a light. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the light triggering part of a thyristor having a conventional pnpn structure. The n region 1 represents a cathode, p region 2 represents a first base, n region 3 represents a second base, p region 4 represents an anode, 6 represents an anode electrode and 9 represents a cathode electrode. The n region 7 represents a cathode region of an auxiliary thyristor and is formed to be shallow in a part in order to increase the number of pairs of electrons and positive holes generated by the light triggering pulse passing through the light fiber cable 8 so that the light permeability may be improved. The electrode 5 is an electrode for short circuiting the n cathode 7 and first base layer 2 with each other. The electrode 9 also short circuits the n cathode 1 and first base layer 2 with each other in a part not shown in the drawing. Both of the n region 7 receiving the irradiation of the light triggering pulse and n region 1 are cathode regions of the thyristor shown in Fig. 1. It is shown in this thyristor that the cathodes 7 and 1 are short circuited with the first base 2. By thus short circuiting the n cathode regions 7 and 1 with the first base layer 2, the surface potentials of the n cathode regions 7 and 1 and of the p base region 2 are kept the same. The light triggering operation shall be explained in the following. By the base resistance voltage drop until the carriers generated by the light flow through the base layer 2 and reach the base electrode 5 or 9, a potential distribution is produced within the base layer 2. The part through which the electrons of the cathodes 7 are most likely to flow is the base layer part just below the n cathode region 7. The electrons slightly flowing out of the n cathode region 7 flow out also to the anode 4 side together with the recombination within the base 2 and run through the n region 3 to be accumulated near the np On the other hand, the light triggering operation of a static induction thyristor SIThy different in the operation principle from the above described thyristor by the base resistance control and turning on and off by controlling the potential.barrier within the channel by the static induction effect is described in JP A 20885 1978 and JP A 40576 1984. A method wherein a gate circuit including a photosensitive element is inserted between the first gate and cathode of the conventional static induction thyristor and the static induction thyristor is turned off by the light irradiation to this photosensitive element has been also already suggested and is disclosed in JP A 128870 1980. As compared with the thyristor of the conventional type pnpn structure shown in Fig. 1, the static induction thyristor has features that, as the potential barrier control within the channel is utilized, the frequency is not limited by the base resistance, the speed can be easily made high and the area can be made large and, as the carriers run at a high speed through the high resistance channel region, even the forward voltage drop is so small as to be less than 1.6V at the current density of 10³A cm² and further has an operation of sucking out at a high speed the carriers within the channel to the gate electrode by the drifting electric field existing between the gate and channel at the time of turning off and therefore high speed turning off is possible. The already practiced or suggested matters regarding the light triggering or light quenching operation shall be summarized as follows. In the conventional type pnpn structure thyristor or gate turn off thyristor, the light triggering operation is carried out as explained in Fig. 1 but the light quenching operation by the gate is not carried out. Generally, turning off is electrically made by commutative circuit inserted between the anode and cathode. Regarding the static induction thyristor, only with respect to a single gate structure, the light triggering is disclosed in JP A 20885 1978 and 40576 1984 and the light quenching is disclosed in JP A 128870 1980. However, in the embodiment disclosed in JP A 128870 1980 the light pulse driving the single gate type SI thyristor is not irradiated directly on the thyristor but is irradiated on the photosensitive element in the external circuit connected to the gate and the quenching light pulse drives the external circuit. That is to say, the impedance of the photosensitive element of the external circuit is varied with the light pulse and thereby the current source voltage applied to the gate of the SI thyristor is varied to be strong or weak to thereby trigger or quench the light in the SI thyristor. On the other hand, there is also a method wherein, in the conventional type pnpn structure thyristor, a pin photodiode as a kind of commutative circuit is connected between the anode and cathode and the light triggering operation is carried out by irradiating the triggering light directly on the thyristor as in Fig. 1 and the light quenching operation is carried out by irradiating the quenching light on the pin photodiode connected between the anode and cathode. This method is published by P. Roggwiler et al in the International Electron Devices Meeting, 1980 on p. 646. However, in this method, the area of the light quenching photodiode must be made so large as to make the anode current flow, the speed is comparatively slow and the efficiency is also low. In the conventional type pnpn structure thyristor or the gate turn off thyristor, the reason why the light quenching operation by the optical gate turn off process is not made is thought to be because the time constant of turning off becomes long due to the base resistance within the first base layer but is due to the great defect that, as the carriers accumulated in the junction part of the second base layer 3 and anode region 4 are vanished by their flow out into the anode region 4 or their recombination with the positive holes injected from the anode region 4, the time constant of turning off becomes long. This is the same also in the light quenching operation of the static induction thyristor of a single gate structure. Further, the presence of a base resistance within the first base layer in the thyristor of the conventional type pnpn structure substantially reduces the sensitivity to the light. In the case of the light triggering and quenching operation by connecting the external circuit which includes the light sensitive element between the first base 2 and cathodes 7 and 1 and controlling the impedance of the external circuit with the light, the internal impedance of the thyristor represented by the base resistance becomes a factor of remarkably reducing the efficiency of the light triggering and quenching operation. Therefore, it is thought that, for the reason that the gate resistance is very small, the static induction thyristor is better in the light triggering and quenching sensitivity. It has not been industrially practiced to turn on or off the direct current with only one light. In order to perfectly separate the high power and control circuits from each other with the light, the direct current must be turned off with the light. In the conventional type pnpn structure thyristor or the gate turn off thyristor, the current is electrically turned off using the commutative circuits and, in the single gate type static induction thyristor, too, the time constant of turning off is determined by the time constant of vanishing the carriers accumulated between the second base and anode the same as light quenching operation. The time constant of turning off of the light triggered thyristor of the conventional pnpn structure is comparatively so long as to be several hundred µs. Furthermore, from DE A 3 011 484 a photosensitive drive circuit of a static induction thyristor is known. This drive circuit uses a photodiode for two terminals. From INTERNATIONAL ELECTRON DEVICES MEETING, San Francisco, 9th 12th December 1984, pages 435 438, FR A 2 443 172 and EP A 0 021 086 a basically MOS transistor controlled lateral thyristor is known, in which a phototransistor is connected to the gate of the MOS transistor to bring about the photosensitivity. An object of the present invention is to provide a thyristor device which can turn on and off a direct current with only a light. More concretely, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a thyristor device wherein, in a single gate type static induction thyristor or single base type beam base thyristor, an electrode is taken on the second base, a function of pulling away carriers accumulated in the first gate and in the second base through photosensitive elements connected outside are provided respectively, the first light pulse is irradiated directly on the thyristor to turn it on and the impedance of the photosensitive element of the external circuit is reduced by the second light pulse so as to pull away the accumulated carriers respectively from the first base and second base to quench turn off the thyristor. Another objects of the present invention is to provide a thyristor device wherein, in a double gate type static induction thyristor, photosensitive elements are connected respectively to the first gate and second gate as external circuits, the thyristor is turned on by the first light pulse, the impedances of the photosensitive elements of the external circuits of the first and second gates are reduced by the second light pulse so as to pull away the carriers accumulated in the first gate and in the second gate to quench turn off the thyristor. Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a structure wherein the above mentioned photosensitive element parts are integrated within the same semiconductor substrate as of the thyristor. Further concretely, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a thyristor device wherein a gate circuit including a SIT high in the photosensitivity or SIT mode bipolar transistor is connected to the gate or base part of a single gate type SI thyristor or single base type beam base thyristor, the light triggering pulse is irradiated directly on the thyristor part to turn it on and the light quenching pulse is irradiated directly on the SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor to turn it on to turn on and off the direct current with only the light. A further object of the present invention is to provide the above mentioned thyristor device wherein a thyristor beam base thyristor can be triggered and quenched by using the light characterized in that the electroconductive type of the channel is reversed which the other electroconductive type of the static induction thyristor remains the same. The operation principle of the thyristor having this beam base structure is that, the same as in the static induction thyristor, the main current flowing through the p or n base region comparatively lower in the impurity density of the beam structure p pp p ...... or n nn n ..... is controlled by the capacitance combination by the base potential of the p or n base region comparatively higher in the impurity density. That is to say, the same operation as of the static induction thyristor is made in respect that the potential of the p or n base region is controlled by the static induction by the potential of the p or n base region and that the main current flowing through the p or n base region is controlled by the potential barrier control of the p or n base region. It is natural that not only the single base type but also the double base structure exists in this beam base thyristor. The beam base thyristor by the electric on off operation is already disclosed by one of the present inventors in the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 16, Supplement 16 1, pp 541 544, 1977. Further, another object of the present invention is to provide such beam base thyristor device on a single base and double base type which can be triggered and quenched by the light. Another object of the present invention is to provide a light triggerable and light quenchable thyristor device wherein a beam base structure of SIT gate structure is adopted respectively in the first base or first gate and in the second base or second gate. The invention concerns a light quenchable thyristor device as characterised in claims 1 and 10. In turning on and off a direct current with only a light by using a thyristor, in the case of using two light pulses so that the thyristor may be driven to be turned on by the first light pulse and may be turned off by driving the external circuit of the gate or base by the second pulse, the triggering operation and quenching operation can be made efficiently at a high speed by using a static induction phototransistor in the external circuit. These two light pulses are not independent of each other but are correlated with each other in a series of light triggering and light quenching operations of the thyristor. The time constant of turning off the light triggered thyristor of the conventional pnpn structure is in the order of several hundred µs, whereas the time constant of turning off at the time of the light quenching operation of the thyristor device according to the present invention is in the order of µs in the light quenchable thyristor device. Even in the light quenchable thyristor device using a single base type beam base thyristor, the time constant is in the order of µs. Further, in the light quenchable thyristor device using a double gate type SI thyristor or double base type beam base thyristor, it is less than 1 µs. There are single gate type and double gate type static induction thyristors. In the single gate type, the gate structure near the cathode is a SIT gate structure but the anode side is of a base structure and takes no electrode. In the double gate type, both first gate and second gate are of SIT gate structures. As described above, there is a beam base structure as a formation realizing the same operation as of the SIT gate structure. In the beam base structure, in a predetermined part within the base, for example, within a plane substantially vertical to the direction in which the main current flows if the base is a p base, there is provided a distribution of such non homogeneous base impurity regions as p pp p. Such modification as a structure in which the p region is embedded within the p base, a plane planar beam base structure and an incised recessed beam base structure are possible. The p region within the base is formed to be mesh shaped, lattice shaped or stripe shaped in the form enclosing the p region within the base and the potential of the p region is selected to be of such dimensions and impurity density as are controlled in the static capacitance by the potential of the p region. It is formed that, with such formation, as compared with the case of a uniform homogeneous base, the base resistance is lower, the frequency characteristic improved and the sensitivity to the light and the gain at the time of turning off are remarkably improved. The SIT gate structure or SIT mode beam base structure operating with the same static induction effect as of the SIT gate structure has features that particularly the sensitivity to the light is very high and, contrary to the characteristics of the conventional uniform homogeneous base structure, the lower the light intensity, the higher the sensitivity. On the cathode side, the region in which the carriers generated by the light are accumulated is the p gate or p base part in which the impurity density is high but the electrons from the cathode flow through the intrinsic gate point or through the low potential part of the intrinsic base point, the potential of the intrinsic gate point or intrinsic base point as seen from the cathode is lower than the potential barrier height between the p gate or base and n cathode when the carriers accumulated by the light flow into the cathode and therefore overwhelmingly many electrons are injected into the channel. The maximum value of the optical gain of the direct current when the gate base is opened is given approximately by where n On the other hand, a feature of such SIT gate structure high in the photosensitivity or the SIT mode beam base structure is that the turn off gain can be taken to be large. The reason for the turn off gain being taken to be large is that, for example, in the first gate or first base region, at the time of turning off, the accumulated carriers near the p gate region or p base region will be pulled out of the p gate region or p base region and, as the potential of the p gate or p base region becomes higher, due to the static induction effect, the potential of the intrinsic gate point or intrinsic base point will also rise and the gate will be turned off. The time constant at the time of turning off depends on both of the time constant for which the accumulated carriers within the first gate or the first base and discharged through the external gate circuit and the time constant for which the accumulated carriers within the second gate or second base vanish. In the case of the SIT gate structure or the SIT mode beam base structure, the internal gate resistance shows a much smaller value than in the case of the conventional type thyristor and, even if the area of the element becomes larger and the capacitance part of the gate or base becomes larger, if the resistance part of the external circuit is made smaller, the thyristor will be able to be turned off at a very high speed. The single gate SI thyristor or the single base type beam base thyristor of the same characteristics is simple in the element structure and is therefore easy to make. On the other hand, the structure complicated but capable of a high speed operation is the double gate type or double base type SI thyristor or beam base thyristor structure wherein the SIT gate structure or SIT mode beam base structure is introduced into the first gate or first base region on the cathode side and the same SIT gate structure or beam base structure is introduced into the second gate or second base region on the anode side. It is found that, in the SI thyristor or beam base thyristor, the time constant of turning off can be made faster by reducing the external resistance part of the gate or base, therefore such phototransistor very high in the photosensitivity as the static induction transistor SIT is connected to the gate or base electrode and the light is irradiated from a fiber or the like on this static induction phototransistor SIPT to reduce the impedance and the external resistance part of the thyristor so that the light quenching operation may be possible. In the light triggering operation, the SIT gate structure of the above mentioned SI thyristor or beam base thyristor or the high photosensitivity of the SIT mode beam base structure is utilized and, in the light quenching operation, the light is irradiated on the SIT very high in the photosensitivity and connected to the gate or base region of the thyristor to reduce the on resistance so that the thyristor may be turned off by the light at a very high speed. It is evident that, when a bipolar transistor called also a punching through bipolar transistor having the above described SIT mode beam base structure is used instead of the SIT of the external gate or base circuit the same characteristic of the light quenching operation will be obtained. Such SIT mode bipolar transistor is likely to be used in integrating within the same substrate the SI thyristor or beam base thyristor and the light quenching transistor. Therefore, the light quenchable thyristor device of the present invention has an important part of the invention the formation wherein at least one of the SIT gate structure and SIT mode beam base structure is applied to the first gate region, first base region, second gate region or second base region of the thyristor and one of the main electrodes of the static induction transistor or SIT mode bipolar transistor is connected to the electrode part of the gate or base region to which the above mentioned structure is applied. Only with such formation, the direct cunrent can be turned off by only the light optical gate turn off and the high power and control circuits can be perfectly separated from each other. In the present invention, two light pulses are required in addition to the thyristor and SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor in the above mentioned important part. One is triggering light pulse for the thyristor and the other is a quenching light pulse for the SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor. Usually, for the light source, a light emitting diode or semiconductor laser can be used but a lamp or the like may be also used depending on the use. Also, various optical fibers may be used to introduce the light pulse into the thyristor. It is also effective to use a plurality of optical fibers to diffuse and emit the light pulse over the entire surface of the thyristor. Otherwise than irradiating the triggering light pulse over the entire surface of the thyristor, there is naturally also a system wherein an auxiliary thyristor of an area of about the diameter of one optical fiber is integrated on the same substrate and the auxiliary thyristor is triggered by the light to turn on the main thyristor. The thyristor device according to the present invention utilized the high photosensitivity of the SIT gate structure or SIT mode beam base structure. In the thyristor part, the SIT gate structure or SIT mode beam base structure exists in the first gate or base region or second gate or base region and therefore the switching efficiency at the time of the triggering operation is very high. In the case of the single gate type SI thyristor, such values as of a turning on delaying time of 1.9 µs and a turning on rising time of 380 ns are obtained with the thyristor of a class of 600V and 10A. On the other hand, the sensitivity to the light of the SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor connected to the gate or base region is very high as described above. Therefore, the excess carriers existing at the turned on state near the SIT gate structure part or beam base structure part within the thyristor are pulled out through the highly photosensitive SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor together with the large turning off current gain owned by the thyristor itself and therefore the turning off operation of the thyristor of the present invention can be made at a speed much higher than the turning off time of 100 µs of the conventional light triggered thyristor. In the case of the single gate type SI thyristor of the class of 600V and 10A, the turning off time is several µs as measured by using such circuit formation connecting the p channel type SIT to the gate as is shown in the later described Fig. 2A and the operation waveforms shown in Figs. 2B and 2C. In the double gate or double beam base thyristor structure or the thyristor structure in which one is an SIT gate structure and the other is a beam base structure and when an SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor is connected to both gate or base regions is adopted, the turn on time and turn off time will be able to be made less than 1 µs. There are advantages that, when the thyristor device according to the present invention is used, if it can turn on and off the direct current by the light, even not only the SI thyristor but also the conventional type thyristor or gate turn off thyristor will do and the high power and control circuits will be able to be perfectly separated from each other. The present invention is very high in the utility value in the device for converting the direct current of a large electric power to an alternating current and is also high in the industrial value in developing a new application to use of a large electric power.

The embodiments of the present invention shall be explained in the following with reference to the drawings. In Fig. 2A showing a circuit diagram of the light triggering and light quenching operations of a single gate type thyristor by the invention , the reference numeral 10 represents a single gate type SI thyristor in which the anode is biased by a voltage source 17 of a voltage V If the external resistance the resistance R While the single gate type SI thyristor 10 is off, if the light L The pulse width T Now, when the light L Thus,the single gate type SI thyristor 10 is turned off. If the gate current of the SI thyristor 10 when the single gate type SI thyristor 10 is turned off is represented by i Even if the light L The pulse width, T By the method explained above, the single gate type SI thyristor 10 can be turned on and off. Fig. 2C shows other operation waveforms of the timing chart of the light L In the operation example in Fig. 2C, in case the light L Now, if the light L At this time, as the breaking over characteristic of the SI thyristor 10 need not be taken into consideration, the resistance R On the other hand, the light L Fig. 3 shows a circuit formation in which the normally on type p channel SIT 20 of the circuit formation shown in Fig. 1A is replaced with the normally on type n channel SIT 60. The drain of the normally on type n channel SIT 60 is connected to the gate of the single gate type SI thyristor 50 and the voltage source 53 is connected to add the negative voltage V Fig. 4A shows an embodiment in the case of making the operation of turning on and off a double gate type SI thyristor by using the light. The anode of the double gate type SI thyristor 70 is biased with the voltage V The embodiment in Fig. 4A and the operation when the LED driving waveforms in Fig. 4B are used are fundamentally the same respectively as the above mentioned embodiment in Fig. 2A and the operation when the timing chart in Fig. 2B is used but, in the double gate type SI thyristor 70, the SIT gate first gate of the single gate type SI thyristor is formed also on the anode side as the second gate, high gains are obtained in both of the first gate and second gate, therefore the photosensitivity is very high and the time T The embodiment in Fig. 4A and the operation using the LED driving waveforms shown in Fig. 4C are fundamentally the same respectively as the embodiment in Fig. 2A and the operation using the LED driving waveforms shown in Fig. 2C. Fig. 5 shows an embodiment in which the normally on type p channel SIT 150 is used instead of the normally on type n channel SIT 90 in the embodiment in Fig. 4A. Besides, there are thought to be an embodiment in which the normally on type n channel SIT is used instead of the normally on type p channel SIT 80 in the embodiment in Fig. 4A and an embodiment in which the normally on type n channel SIT and normally on type p channel SIT are used instead respectively of the normally on type p channel SIT 80 and normally on type n channel SIT 90 in the embodiment in Fig. 4A. Any of these embodiments can be operated with the LED driving operation waveforms shown in Figs. 4B and 4C. Fig. 6A shows an embodiment in which the normally off type p channel SIT 170 is used instead of the normally on type p channel SIT 20 in Fig. 2A. Fig. 6B shows an embodiment in which the normally off type p channel SIT 190 and normally off type n channel SIT 200 are used instead respectively of the normally on type p channel SIT 80 and normally on type n channel SIT 90. As the normally off type p channel SIT s 170 and 190 and normally off type n channel SIT 200 can be operated with the gates open, the circuit formations become simple. There are thought to be embodiments using the normally off type SIT s for all the embodiments using the above described normally on type SIT s. They can be operated with the same LED driving waveforms. Fig. 7A shows an embodiment of the light on off operating circuit of the normally off single gate type SI thyristor requiring another current source voltage than the anode voltage. The gate of the single gate type SI thyristor 210 is connected to the ground through the normally off type p channel SIT 220. While the light L Fig. 8 shows further another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the light triggering and quenching operation circuit of the double base type beam base thyristor 260 is shown. In this case, the operation waveforms of the light L Figs. 9 and 10 show embodiments wherein a plurality of the above described SIT thyristors or beam base thyristors are connected respectively in series or in parallel so as to be able to make the light triggering and quenching operations of a large voltage and current. The thyristors may be connected naturally in series or in parallel. A protective commuting circuit for preventing the large voltage or current from being added to a specific thyristor may be connected between the anode and cathode of each thyristor. As described above, the formation of the light triggered and quenched thyristor device may be of the SI thyristor of not only the single gate structure but also the double gate structure or of the beam base thyristor of the single base or double base structure. The gate circuit forming transistor may be the p channel or n channel SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor. If it is the normally off transistor, the gate circuit will become simpler. Fig. 9 shows an embodiment wherein a plurality of formation units of the single gate type SI thyristor 290 and normally on type p channel SIT 300 are connected in series. The optical fibers 303, 304 and 305 are to introduce triggering light pulses into the SI thyristors so that the triggering LED light L Fig. 10 shows an embodiment in which the circuit forming units explained with reference to Fig. 2A are connected in parallel and which will be carried out in the case of handling a large current. The important part is formed of the SI thyristor 310 and normally on type p channel SIT 320. The gate bias voltage source 312 is parallelly connected to the respective SIT s 320 through the drain bias voltage source 311 and gate resistor 313. The optical fibers 314, 315 and 316 are to introduce the triggering light pulses into the thyristors 310. The optical fibers 317, 318 and 319 are to introduce quenching light pulses into the SIT s 320. A large current can be light triggered and light quenched by using the operation waveforms explained in Figs. 2B and 2C. Figs. 11A to 16 show structural embodiments of the light triggered and quenched thyristor device according to the present invention, characterized by an integrated structure of the single gate or double gate type SI thyristor or single base or double base type beam base thyristor and the SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor connected to the first base gate or second base gate . Fig. 11A shows a structure integrating the single gate type SIT thyristor and SIT mode bipolar transistor. For the operation circuit, there can be applied the circuit in which, in Figs. 2A, 6A and 7A, the p channel SIT s 20, 170 and 220 are replaced with the pnp bipolar transistors. The operating method is the same as is made with reference to Figs. 2A to 2C. The operation waveforms shown in Figs. 2B and 2C can be applied. In Fig. 11A, the p region 403 represents a thyristor buried gate layer and is made common with the emitter region of the pnp bipolar transistor. The n region 400 represents a thyristor cathode region. 401 represents a cathode electrode. The n layer 402 is made a high resistance layer to secure the breakdown voltage between the gate layer 403 and cathode 400. The n region 409 is the channel region of the thyristor. On the other hand, the p region 404 is the anode region of the thyristor. 405 represents the anode electrode. The n high resistance layers 406, 407 and 410 and a beam base layer is formed between it and the n high resistance layer 407. The positions of the beam base layers 407 and 408 are set to be near the anode p region 404. In the embodiment in Fig. 11A, the n base region 408 is made to float. As a matter of course, the single gate type SI thyristor, the beam base structure formed of the above described n high resistance layer 407 and n buried layer is not indispensable but may be replaced with the n high resistance layers 410 and 406. The collector region of the SIT mode bipolar transistor is the p region 415 and the n region 412 and n region 411 are the base regions. The n layer 402 and n layer 411 are simultaneously formed. 413 represents the base electrode and 414 represents the collector electrode. In order to improve the permeability of the light quenching light pulse L In the light triggering operation of the SI thyristor, it is desirable that both electron hole pairs generated by the light triggering light pulse L Fig. 11B shows a structure of integrating the single beam base thyristors and inverted operation SIT s. The operation circuit and operating method are the same as in the embodiment in Fig. 11A. The structural differences from the embodiment in Fig. 11A are that the n high resistance regions 402, 409, 410, 407, 406 and 411 are replaced respectively with the p high resistance regions 424, 423, 422, 421, 420 and 425 and that the light triggering light pulse L Fig. 11c shows an embodiment wherein the optical fiber 417 for introducing the light triggering light pulse L The embodiments shown in Figs. 11A to 11C are exemplifications. As shown in Fig. 15, a thin n layer is provided in the form of a step in the part of the cathode n region in Fig. 11C and the light fiber may be made to emit the light to that part. Further, in Figs. 11A to 11C, the SIT mode beam base structure or SIT gate structure need not be particularly provided in the second base region or second gate region but the n or p high resistance layer region may remain as it is. Or an n layer having a pn junction with the p anode layer 404 may be provided. Fig. 12A and 12B show other structural embodiments of the present invention. The first gate or beam base region is the buried gate or buried beam base in Fig. 11 but is the recessed gate or recessed beam base in Figs. 12A and 12B. The gate electrode 503 is attached to the recessed part in the p gate region 504 so as to reduce the gate resistance. The light triggering pulse L Fig. 12B shows another embodiment close to the integrated structure in Fig. 12A. In Fig. 12B,the single base type beam base thyristor having the SIT gate made to float in the second gate region and the p channel SIT are integrated. In this embodiment, the n high resistance layer regions 502, 505, 506, 511, 507 and 517 in Fig. 12A are replaced respectively with the p high resistance layer regions 520, 522, 523, 524, 525 and 521. The difference from the embodiment in Fig. 12A is that the diffusion depth of the n gate region 516 of the SIT part is larger than the diffusion depth of the n cathode region 500. The p region 521 represents the channel region of the SIT, the p region 504 represents the high impurity density base region of the beam base thyristor and, at the same time, the source region of the SIT. The p region 518 is the drain region. 514 and 515 represent respectively the gate electrode and drain electrode of the SIT. It is natural that the potential of the p layer can vary due to the static induction effect by the potential of the n gate region 510. Each of the embodiments shown in Figs. 11A to 12B, can be turned off by pulling out the positive holes accumulated in the first gate region or first base region through the bipolar transistor of the SIT mode or the SIT of the p channel but can be also turned off by only pulling out the electrons accumulated in the second gate region or second base region through the bipolar transistor of the SIT mode or the n channel SIT. Figs. 13A and 13B show embodiments of such thyristor device. The embodiment of the integrated structure of the single base type beam base thyristor 620 having the SIT gate structure made to be of a floating potential in the first gate region and the SIT mode beam base structure in the second base region and the n channel SIT 621. Fig. 13B shows the circuit formation. The electrode parts 600, 611, 616 and 617 represent respectively the cathode electrode and anode electrode of the thyristor and the gate electrode and drain electrode of the SIT. The beam base structure is formed of the n base region 609 and n base region 610 and, at the same time, the n base region 609 is made common with the source region of the light quenching SIT 621. The voltage proofing function between the anode and second beam base layer is secured by the n high resistance layer 613 between the p region 612 and beam base layers 609 and 610. The optical fibers 604 and 605 are respectively to introduce the light triggering light pulse L In the embodiments shown in Figs. 11A to 13B, the SIT structure or SIT mode beam base structure is formed as one gate or base layer and the other base or gate region is formed as a floating beam base structure or SIT gate structure. As one is made to float, the role of the gate or base as of the general thyristor is meant only by the other gate or base region to which the SIT or SIT mode bipolar transistor is connected. For this reason, the thyristor devices whose sectioned structures are shown in Figs. 11A to 13B are called single gate type SI thyristors or single base type beam base thyristors. On the other hand, the embodiments shown in Figs. 14 to 16 show the integrated structures wherein the light quenching SIT s or SIT mode bipolar transistors are connected to the first gates or first bases and second gates or second bases. Fig. 14 shows an embodiment of the present invention by the double gate type SI thyristor. In both first gate and second gate regions, the SIT mode bipolar phototransistors are integrated. The operation circuit is the same as the operation circuits shown in Figs. 4A, 6B and 7B in which the SIT mode pnp bipolar transistors are connected instead of the p channel SIT s 800, 190 and 240 and the SIT mode npn bipolar transistors are connected instead of the n channel SIT s 90, 200 and 250. The operating method can be carried out the same by using the operation waveforms shown in Figs. 4B and 4C. As a matter of course, the series connection, parallel connection and series parallel connection using the double gate type, double base type and gate base type thyristors shown in Figs. 14 to 16 are effective for a large electric power.
