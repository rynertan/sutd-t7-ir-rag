# DOUBLE FLEXING COUPLING IN A PARALLEL ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A flexible torque transmission coupling, comprising a driving member 12 , a rigid center member 14 , and a driven member 16 aligned on a longitudinal axis 18 . A plurality of flexible elements 24, 26, 28, 30 is located between the driving and the driven members, each flexible element being symmetrical about the longitudinal axis. At least two of the flexible elements 24, 26 are coupled in parallel between the center member and either the driving or the driven hubs, and at least one of the flexible elements 28 is coupled between the center member and the other hub.
