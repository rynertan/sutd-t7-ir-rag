# Method for disposal of chemical waste.

## Abstract
A process for the safe and efficient disposal of toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon waste materials in which the chlor inated hydrocarbon is brought into close surface contact with a finely divided para or ferromagnetic material, such as fluidized bed of iron powder, in the presence of high intensity microwave radiation, so as to effect an electron transfer reaction which yields chloride anions, which subse quently react with the iron to form ferrous chloride, and an organic radical which is readily oxidized, in the presence of gaseous oxygen, to carbon dioxide and water.
