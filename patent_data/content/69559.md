# Marine paint.

## Abstract
A marine paint capable of becoming smoother in relatively moving sea water comprises a film forming copolymer and a metalliferous pigment which is sparingly soluble in sea water. The copolymer comprises 20 80 per cent by weight of units of a quinolinyl or substituted quinolinyl ester of an olefinicaily unsaturated carboxylic acid with the balance of the copolymer being units of at least one olefinically unsaturated comonomer or comprises 10 to 80 per cent by weight of a units of a quinolinyl or substituted quinolinyl ester of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, up to 60 percent by weight of b units of a triorgano tin salt of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, with a and b together forming 20 to 80 per cent by weight of the copolymer, and the balance of the copolymer being units of at least one olefinically unsaturated comonomer.
