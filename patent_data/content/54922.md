# Internal shield for trough like reflector.

## Abstract
A lighting fixture having a trough type reflector 27 and further having planar end reflectors 22, 24 , such fixture also including at least one planar shield 110 parallel to the long axis of the trough type reflector and having an edge parallel to the aiming axis of the fixture. The shield is undercut 114 to permit light emanations from the lamp to be reflected from the entire trough type reflector. The shield also includes depending points at the points of contact with the end reflectors, thereby preventing light from being reflected from the end re flectors outside of the shield.
