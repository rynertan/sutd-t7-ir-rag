# Phased array for ultrasonic medical imaging.

## Abstract
A bi plane phased array for real time medical imaging comprises a composite piezoelectric disk 3 with an array of transducer element electrodes 5a, 5b, 5c,... 6a, 6b, 6c,... disposed on each major surface 1, 2 of said disk, the array on one side being at an angle to the array on the other side and switching means 14 to ground each array alternately so that real time sector imaging in two planes is obtained.
