# Photographic exposure control system comprising fill flash.

## Abstract
A photographic exposure control system of the type for controlling both the duration of a photographic exposure interval and the amount of artificial illumination provided during the exposure interval includes the capability of increasing the amount of artificial illumina tion in direct corresponding relation with increases in the camera to subject distance and the ambient scene light intensity in order to maintain the same proportions between the contributions to the film exposure from the ambient and from the artificial light during a fill flash exposure.
