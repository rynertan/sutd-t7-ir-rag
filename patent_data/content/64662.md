# Method of forming a silicon and copper doped aluminum metallization and a Schottky diode.

## Abstract
The method includes the steps of depositing the consti tuents of the metallization on a silicon body where the constituents are deposited in two or three layers consisting of different materials or material combinations but contain ing not more than two constituents and where the layer adjacent to the silicon body is not formed from aluminum as well as copper, and by sintering the whole unit to form the Schottky diode. Four embodiments of the method are described. The produced Schottky diodes are resistant to internal field emission characteristics created by co incidental cop per aluminum precipitates and aluminum doped solid phase epitaxial grown silicon mounds.
