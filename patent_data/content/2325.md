# A compressed air dehumidifier.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger for cooling system compressed air dehumidifiers includes an inner body 1 forming a dehumidifying passage 2 provided with a cooler 16 , an outer body 5 surrounding the inner body 1 and forming a pre cooling passage 6 along the outer periphery of the inner body 1 , an air supply port 10 in the outer body 5 , through which compressed air is led into the pre cooling passage 6 from one end thereof, a communicating hole 11 in the inner body 1 to guide the air led into the pre cooling passage 6 out through its other end into the dehumidifying passage 2 through one end thereof, and a plurality of heat transmitting pipes 14 extending through the precooling passage 6 in order to form an air flow passage which guides the compressed air out of the other end of the dehumidifying passage 2 to an air discharge port 12 provided in the outer body 5 . The heat of the compressed air in the air flow passage 14 which has been cooled and dehumidified in the dehumidifying passage and is flowing towards the air discharge port 12 is exchanged with that of the compressed air of relatively high temperature in the pre cooling passage 6 flowing from the air supply port 10 towards the dehumidifying passage 2 . In this manner, the heat exchanger simultaneously precools the compressed air to be dehumidified and heats already dehumidified compressed air. Further, by maintaining the outer body 5 which forms the outer surface of the heat exchanger at a relatively high temperature dew drops on the surface are prevented from forming.
