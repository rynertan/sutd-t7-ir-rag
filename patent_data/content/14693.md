# An improved ultrasonic transducer.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic transducer, particularly for diagnostic pur poses, includes a piezoelectric element 14 such as a PVDF film, backed with a reflective layer 12 of a reduced thickness specified in relation to the wavelength of sound waves within the reflective layer at half the free resonant frequency of the piezoelectric element. Remarkable reduction in thickness provides a high transfer efficiency, a broad available frequency band and an easy application of fine treatment such as etching.
