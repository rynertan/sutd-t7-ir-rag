# Impact press.

## Abstract
An impact press 20 includes drive means for reciprocat ing a sleeve 50 at one end of which a ram 55 is slidably and rotatably carried, the same being normally held in a retracted position by retaining means 59 . The drive means that recip rocates the sleeve 50 toward and away from impact tooling 22 also regulates in synchronization therewith a releasing means 66 76 by which the retaining means 59 lets go of the ram 55 to permit it to fly under the influence of a bias until it impacts the tooling 22 . Reaction from the tooling 22 after the punching has been completed provides a force for receiv ing the ram 55 in the sleeve 50 . If desired, the driving means can also be used to regulate the operation of a workpiece feeder 24 , a workpiece brake 25 , and any regulator 94 that the impact tooling 22 may have all in synchronization with the movements of the sleeve 50 . If a conventional air feeder 24 is used, owing to limitations of the feeder 24 , the device can be operated at 180 strokes per minute. Without such feeder 24 smaller workpieces can be made or modified at the rate of 500 strokes per minute.
