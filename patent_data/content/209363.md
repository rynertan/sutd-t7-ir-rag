## Description
PENICILLINSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to penicillins.The tripeptide 6 L a aminoadipyl L cysteinyl D valine ACV is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of ss lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and cephamycins. To be more specific.it is apparent that Penicillium chrvsoaenum andAcremonium chrysogenum also known as CePhalosporium acremonium share initial steps in the biosynthesis of B lactams. In the biosynthesis, the tripeptide ACV is formed from L aminoadipate, L cysteine, andL valine, followed by cyclization of ACV to isopenicillin N. Thereafter, the biosynthetic pathways diverge. With Penicillium, the L aminoadipyl side chain is exchanged for a hydrophobic one, for example, a phenylacetyl side chain in the case of penicillin G benzylpenicillin . With Acremonium, the L a aminoadipyl side chain is epimerized to theD form, giving penicillin N, followed by expansion of the thiazolidine ring of the penicillin N to give deacetoxycephalosporin C. Studies have been carried out by various research teams on the substrate specificity of the cyclization enzyme isopenicillin N synthetase, also called cyclase which acts to cyclize ACV to isopenicillin N. It has been established that the isopenicillin N synthetases ofP. chrysoqenum and A. chrssoaenum show a narrow substrate specificity. For example, it has been demonstrated that a tripeptide containing glycine in the place of valine will block the cyclization process. It has also been shown that ACV cyclization is inhibited when the related tripeptide glutathione y glutamyl cysteinyl glycine is added to the reaction mixture.In general, the results show that there is some flexibility in the nature of the amino acid that is,D valine at the third position of the tripeptide, no flexibility in the second position L cysteine , and only limited flexibility in the first position L a aminoadipic acid . Thus, althoughL carboxymethylcysteine, adipic acid orD a aminoadipic acid can replace L a aminoadipic acid at the first position of the tripeptide, there are many more acids which can not, including L glutamic acid, L aspartic acid, caproic acid, delta aminovaleric acid, glutaric acid, aminopimelic acid, and acetic acid. Indeed, the Oxford team of Baldwin et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun, 1225 1227, 1984 recently concluded that the first residue of the tripeptide must have a six carbon or equivalent chain terminating in a carboxy group, in order for successful conversion to a penicillin.Furthermore, it is thought that the failure of a number of attempts to force CePhalosporium to produce directly a phenylacetylcephalosporin by feeding phenylacetic acid arises presumably because Cethalosotiun lacks the penicillin acyltransferase enzyme thought to be necessary.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide new routes to penicillins and related compounds. A further object is the provision of new substrates for the enzyme cyclase.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn an unexpected manner, it has been found that a cyclase can convert the heteropeptide phenylacetylL cysteinyl D valine PCV directly in to benzylpenicillin penicillin G and the heteropeptide phenoxyacetyl L cysteinyl D valine POCV to penicillin V, and can analogously convert other arylacyl L cysteinyl D valine heteropeptides to penicillins.Thus, the present invention provides a process for producing a penicillin which comprising cyclizing PCV,POCV or other PCV analogue, using a cyclase.The heteropeptides PCV and POCV are themselves novel compounds. The formulae of these novel compounds are as follows EMI4.1 EMI4.2 More generally, the heteropeptides for use in the present invention are novel compounds, and form part of this invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe present invention is based on the surprising discovery that the heteropeptide PCV can be directly converted to benzylpenicillin by cell free extracts ofAcremonium chrysogenum. Further work has indicated that other arylacyl L cysteinyl D valine heteropeptides can be converted to penicillins, and that other enzyme sources can be used. The yields are currently relatively low, but nevertheless the extent of conversion is significant and does clearly indicate the affinity of the cyclase for the arylacyl heteropeptides.Through genetic engineering techniques it might be possible to increase the affinity. Furthermore, if the ring expansion enzyme deacetoxycephalosporin C synthetase expandase of A. chrYsoqenum can also be genetically modified to accept a hydrophobic penicillin as substrate, a hydrophobic cephalosporin might be produced.The cyclase for use in the process of this invention is typically employed as a cell free extract of a cyclase producing micro organism, such as a cyclaseproducing fungus or bacterium. Suitable cyclase producing fungi and bacteria includeA. chrysoqenum, P. chrysopenum and Stretomvces clavuliqerus. Cell free extracts can be obtained by harvesting the culture, resuspending the cells in a suitable buffered medium0 disrupting the cells for example by sonification and then centrifuging to generate the crude extract. The crude cyclase may be purified by conventional techniques.As an alternative to cell free extracts, it is possible that dead, lysed cells or cells rendered permeable to the heteropeptide might be employed a simple test will determine if a cyclase source is converting the heteropeptide substrate to the desired ss lactam. Immobilized forms of the cyclase or cyclase containing material can be employed, using conventional immobilization techniques.The present invention also extends to the use of improved cyclases, since it is envisaged that genetic engineering and other techniques might be used to develop cells with modified cyclases improved for use in the present process. Initially the present process is intended for production of penicillin G, penicillin V, or other well known penicillins with aromaticity in the 6 amido sidechain.It is foreseen that other heteropeptides might be employed, if necessary in conjunction with chemical or biosynthetic modification. In this way, it might eventually be possible to produce semi synthetic penicllins. The novel heteropeptides of this invention will have a corresponding structure, and might include heteropeptides of the general formula Ar Z CO cysteinyl valine where Ar represents an aromatic group, for example a phenyl or heteroaromatic ring such as a 5 or 6 membered heteroaromatic ring with 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur , which may be unsubstituted or substituted with appropriate substituents such as 1 to 3 substituents selected from methyl, methoxy, phenoxy, hydroxy, chorine, fluorine and the like , and Z represents a single bond, a group CHR where R is typically H, NH2, COOH, or the like, protected if necessary , a group OCHR or a divalent heterocyclic group such as a 5 or 6 membered heteroaromatic ring with 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur .The heteropeptides of the invention are preferably used in the form Ar Z CO L cysteinyl D valine, since it is believed that other isomeric forms might inhibit the action of the cyclase.Conventional techniques for peptide synthesis can be adopted for use in the present invention for preparation of the substrate heteropeptides. Such techniques typically comprise coupling of amino acids, usually as derivatives and or by the use of special coupling agents. A typical method for preparing the heteropeptides involves the N acylation of cystine, followed by coupling with a valine derivative such as a benzhydryl ester using conventional coupling techniques, for example the EEDQ technique. Deprotection then yields the heteropeptide as the disulphide.Alternatively, cystine may be coupled to valine using techniques known in the art, followed by addition of the appropriate acyl group to the dipeptide. The heteropeptide may also be prepared utilising other known methods for joining amino acids.The heteropeptides are conveniently prepared and stored as disulphides arising from the presence of the thio group in the cystine. The bis heteropeptide may then be converted to the mono form in situ by the use of an appropriate reducing agent, for example dithiothreitol.For small scale investigative work, suitable conditions might involve incubating cell free extracts of the cyclase 5 to 20 mg of protein ml at a 20 to 37 C for o to 120 minutes in a suitable buffered reaction mixture, such as the following reaction mixture 30mMTris HCl buffer pH 7.5 to 8.1, 4 to 6mM DTT, 0.1 toO.5mM FeS04, 1 to 3mM Na ascorbate and O.2 3mM bis heteropeptide. The reaction can be stopped by the addition of methanol.The formation of penicillin may be assayed using a bioassay technique, for example by plating the sample on to agar inoculated with a susceptible bacterium. The reaction products can readily be identified by HPLC and other chromatographic techniques known in the art.Furthermore, the penicillins can be prepared as salts or esters, for example by salification or esterification of a free acid.The isolated penicillin can be formulated in conventional manner with pharmaceutical carriers in order to provide suitable dosage forms. THE DRAWINGIn the following Examples, reference is made to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a graph with time of benzylpenicillin synthesis and isapenicillin N synthesis, respectivley from PCV and ACV, using enzyme extracted fromStreptomyces clavuliqerus.

Co. St. Louis. U.S.A. . Other chemicals used were reagent quality or HPLC grade. Streptomyces clavuliqerus ATTC 27054 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. EXAMPLE 1SYNTHESIS OF PHENYLACETYL L CYSTEINYL D VALINE PCV Phenylacetyl L cysteinyl D valine PCV was synthesized from phenylacetyl S trityl L cysteine previously obtained by reaction of phenylacetyl chloride withS trityl L cysteine and p toluenesulphonateD valine benzyhydryl ester using the N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1, 2 dihydroquinoleine technique EEDQ described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc.90 1651 1652. Protected PCV was synthesized by this procedure, and the dimer bis PCV was finally obtained by hydrolysis. The PCV was used as the free thiol, or the disulphide dimer was reduced to the monomer in situ with dithiothreitol DTT .Samples of bis PCV were hydrolysed in a vacuum sealed tube with 5.9 M tridistilled HC1 containing 0.1 v v phenol for 25 hours to determine the PCV composition.After this treatment, samples were dried in a desiccator with NaOH, washed twice with bidistilled water and analysed with a Durrum D 500 amino acid autoanalyzer.A sample of cystine was treated in identical conditions at the same time and no destruction of this molecule was observed. Cystine and valine were present in the correct proportions. The remaining product was identified by gas chromatography as phenylacetic acid using a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph with a column of diethyleneglycol succinate 20 at 1700C. PCV was also synthesized according to the methodology described by Wolfe and Jokinen in Can. J. Chem.57 1388 1396 1979, using phenylacetic acid instead ofL a aminoadipic acid.Physical properties of the PCV were as follows Melting point 1900C dec. .Optical Rotation 25 73.05 phosphate buffer 50 mM, pH 8.0 .Infrared Spectroscopy KBr cm 1 3400 N H 3300 br, acid O H 1750 amide, C O 1670 and 1550 phenyl group 1355 and 1400 CH3 2 CHi.

EXAMPLE 2 PREPARATION OF ISOPENICILLIN N SYNTHETASE FROM STREPTOMYCES CLAVULIGERUS AND DETERMINATION OF CYCLIZATION ACTIVITY AND REACTION PRODUCTS USING PCV AND ACV AS SUBSTRATES.S. clavuligerus ATTC 27064 was maintained and grown as described by O Sullivan et al. in Biochem. J. 179 47 52, 1979. 250 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes, washed four times by resuspension in sterile saline solution and centrifuged as before. The precipitated cells, resuspended in 25 ml of 50 ml Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing O.lmM DTT TD buffer , were sonicated as described in J. Antibiot. 35 483 490, 1982, using aBranson Sonifier Cell Disruptor B 12 . The broken cell suspension was ultra centrifuged at 100,000 x g Beckman L5 65B for 90 minutes, treated with 0.2 w v protamine sulphate and the clear extract precipitated with ammonium sulphate 30 80 saturation, for example 50 808 saturation .The resulting precipitate was resuspended in 3 ml of TD buffer and applied to aSephadex Trade Mark G 25, PD 10 column Pharmacia .Aliquots of 1 ml were collected and assayed for isopenicillin N synthetase cyclase activity.Fractions 4 and 5, containing maximal activity, were mixed and employed for the reaction. The cyclase extracts were stored frozen at 20 C. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al described in J.Biol. Chem. 193 265 273, 1951.Cyclization activity of the cyclase on ACV or PCV was assayed by a slightly modified version of the method described by Jensen et al. in J.Antibiot. 35 483 490, 1982 and in Antibiotics and Other Secondary Metabolites pages 141 164, Academic Press. The reaction mixture contained 3OmM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.5 0.5 mM PeS04 lmM bis ACV or 3mM bis PCV 4mM DTT 3 mM Na ascorbate and enzyme lOmg of protein in a final reaction volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 250C for 90 min and stopped by adding 0.5ml of methanol.In various experiments it was shown that the cyclization of the tripeptide ACV by isopenicillin N synthetase extracted from S. clavuliqerus generated isopenicillin N, whereas the cyclization of PCV resulted in benzylpenicillin.The formation of isopenicillin N and benzylpenicillin was measured by bioassay against M. luteus ATCC 9341 following the hole plate method described in Biochem. J.103 877 890, 1967. Penicillin N and benzylpenicillin were used as standards. One unit of antibiotic penicillin N or benzylpenicillin gave a zone of inhibition equivalent to lwg or 1.58 iig of penicillin N or benzylpenicillin respectively with M.luteus ATCC 9341 as test organism.Cyclization of PCV led to the formation of a molecule active against M. luteus ATTC 9341 and sensitive to ss lactamase I from Bacillus careus Difco Table 1 .The cycllization product of PCV lost over 90 per cent of its antibacterial activity when incubated with 2 I.U. of penicillin acylase at 30 C for 10 minutes. In contrast the isopenicillin N obtained from the cyclization of ACV was not sensitive to penicillin acylase Table I . Table 1. Conversion of peptides to penicillin by S. clavuligerus cyclase.

These results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 BenzYlPenicillin U ml Complete reaction mixture 0.15 Without PCV 0.0 Without enzyme 0.0The kinetics of cyclization with the cyclase were studied. Fig 1 shows that formation of penicillin G from PCV followed a slow time dependent course whereas synthesis of isopenicillin N from ACV was much faster.Under the above cyclization conditions, 0.15 U ml of benzylpenicillin were produced, while in similar conditions, 40 U ml of isopenicillin N evaluated as penicillin N were obtained.Isopenicillin N from the reaction mixture was identified under the conditions described by Jensen et al in J.Antibiot. 35 1026 1032, 1982. Benzylpenicillin obtained by cyclization of PCV, was identified by the following method. Five reactions 200 ml were carried out using PCV as substrate in order to isolate sufficient reaction product for identification. After incubation, each reaction mixture was vigorously extracted with 30 ml of chilled amyl acetate containing 2.2 ml of phosphoric acid 83 v v, density 1.7 according to the method described by Revilla et al in J.Antibiotic. 37 781 789. The extracted product was transferred to loml of 50mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and re extracted with 3ml of amyl acetate containing 10 1 of phosphoric acid. The product in the organic phase was transferred again to 1 ml of 50mM phospate buffer, pH 7.0 and kept in a refrigerator. The five processed samples were mixed, re extracted with 2 ml of amyl acetate containing 8 grl of phosphoric acid and transferred to 750 1 of phosphate buffer. By this procedure about 100 Bg of benzylpenicillin were obtained. Purification of the penicillin was carried out by HPLC using a Perkin Elmer Chromatograph Series 3B with a LC 7 spectrophotometric detector and a Sigma 10 BChromatography Data Station. A ii Bondapack C18 column of 30cm Waters Associates Inc. and a mobile phase composed of 83 v v of 0.1 M sodium acetate acetic acid pH 4.5 and 17 v v of acetonitrile was used. The retention time of benzylpenicillin under these conditions was 12.3 minutes.Benzylpenicillin was also identified by descending paper chromatography Whatman No.l paper buffered with 10 sodium citrate at pH 3.7 using the following solvent systems 1 pyridine n butanol water 1 1 1 II n butanol ethanol water 4 1 5, upper phase by thin layer electrphoresis in pyridine acetic acid water 1 10 135 pH 3.5, 300 v cm for 2 hours and by paper electrophoresis at 13 v cm in collidine acetate buffer 0.05 M acetate pH 7.0 for 3 hours. The spots of penicillin and its transformation product penicilloic acid obtained by incubation with ss lactamase from B.cereus UL1 were located by spraying the paper or thin layer with 0.5 M NaOH followed by starch iodine as described by Lopez Nieto page 77 of phD Thesis,University of Salamanca, Spain. EXAMPLE 3 PREPARATION OF ISOPENICILLIN N SYNTHETASE FROM PENICILLIUM CHRYSOGENUM AND DETERMINATION OF CYCLIZATION ACTIVITY AND REACTION PRODUCTS USING PCV AND ACV AS SUBSTRATES.Example 2 was repeated but using isopenicillin N synthetase extracted from a high producing strain ofPenicillium chrysoenum Penicillium chrssoqenum AS P 78, Luengo et al J. Antibiot. 144 869 876 .Cells containing high isopenicillin N synthetase activity were obtained in a two stage process as described in J. Antibiot. 144 869 876. Cell free extracts were obtained as described by Ramos et al inAntimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27 3 380 387. Mycelium of P. chrysogenum was collected at 24 hours of cultivation in cephalosporin production medium CP medium and resuspended in 30mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing O.lmM dithiothreitol DTT . The myceliun was disrupted by sonification for 5 minutes. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 40C in a Beckman L8 70 ultracentrifuge and the resulting crude extract was stored at 20 C. Isopenicillin N synthetase were purified as previously described inAntimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27 3 380 387.As in Example 2, the use of the extracted enzyme resulted in the cyclization of ACV to isopenicillin N and PCV to benzylpenicillin. Both reaction products were completely inactivated by penicillinase. When PCV was used as the substrate, the reaction product was inactivated by penicillin acylase. Inactivation of the reaction product by penicillin acylase did not occur with ACV as substrate.The isopenicillin N and benzylpenicillin formed by cyclization of 0.2mM ACV or 2mM PCV using cyclase of A. chrysoqenum was assayed by the following bioassay.After the reactions were stopped with methanol, triplicate 50 1 samples were applied to wells 7mm in diameter in plates containing 1Sml of Tryptic Soy Agar TSA medium Difco innoculated with Micrococcus luteus 0.5 ml of a culture having an O.D. of 1.0 at 600nm . Control samples of pure isopenicillin N or benzylpenicillin were treated with methanol in a similar way to the reaction samples. The samples in the assay plates were kept at 40C for 3 hours to allow diffusion and then incubated at 300C for 12 hours.Figure 2 shows HPLC elution patterns of a pure benzylpenicillin retention time 12.3 minutes b the reaction product of PCV cyclization using P. chrYsoqenum cyclase after solvent extraction and c the reaction product of PCV cyclization treated with penicillin acylase and extracted with solvent. Conditions were as given previously for isolation and charaterization of the cyclization products.The location after chromatography of the antibiotic substance obtained by cyclization of PCV with extracts of P. chrysogenum was also established by cutting the chromatography paper into 1.5 x 0.5 cm segments and testing each piece on a plate of TSA previously seeded with a lawn of E. coli ESS or M. luteus. The activity against both microorganisms was located in the segment having an Rf of 0.67 benzylpenicillin . When similar experiments were carried out with samples in which ACV was the substrate of the cyclase, the bioactivity was located in the first and second segment Rf 0.06 . EXAMPLE 4 PREPARATION OF ISOPENICILLIN N SYNmleiPASE FROM ACREMONIUM CHRYSOGENUM AND DETERMINATION OF CYCLIZATION ACTIVITY AND REACTION PRODUCTS USING PCV AND ACV AS SUBSTRATES.Example 2 was repeated but using isopenicillin N synthetase extracted from a high producing strain ofAcremonium chrysoqenum A. chrvsoaenum C 10 available from A. L. Demain .Cells containing high isopenicillin N synthetase activity were obtained in a two stage process as described in J. Antibiot. 144 869 876. A. chrvsogenum cultures were developed in seed medium for 4 days and these used to innoculate 6Oml of chemically defined cephalosporin production medium, CP medium . Cell free extracts were obtained as described by Ramos et al in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27 3 380 387.Mycelium of A. chrysogenum was collected at 64 hours of cultivation in CP medium and resuspended in 30mMTris HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing O.lmM dithiothreitol DTT . The mycelium was disrupted by sonification for 2 minutes. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hour at 40C in a Beckman L8 70 ultracentrifuge and the resulting crude extract was stored at 20 C.Isopenicillin N synthetase was purified as previously described in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27 3 380 387.As in Examples 2 and 3, the extracted enzyme resulted in the cyclization of ACV to isopenicillin N and PCV to benzylpenicillin. Both reaction products were completely inactivated by penicillinase but only whenPCV was used as the substrate was the reaction product inactivated by penicillin acylase.Bioassay of the isopenicillin N and benzylpenicillin formed by the A. chrysoqenum cyclase was performed in a similar way to the method described in Example 3 for assaying the penicillins produced by the cyclase extracted from P. chrysogenum.The location after chromatography of the antibiotic substance obtained by cyclization of PCV with extracts of A. chrysopenum was established as in Example 3 and similar results obtained. EXAMPLE 5 PREPARATION OF ISOPENICILLIN N SYNTHETASE FROM PENICILLIUM CHRYSOGENUM AND DETERMINATION OF CYCLIZATION ACTIVITY AND REACTION PRODUCTS USING POCV AS SUBSTRATE.Example 3 was repeated but using phenoxyacetylL cysteinyl D valine POCV as substrate in place of PCV. POCV was prepared by either standard methods described by Baldwin et al in J. Chem Soc. Perkin. Trans.1,1981,2253 or by N acylation of cystine, followed by ethyl 1,2 dihydro 2 ethoxy 1 quinoline carboxylate EEDQ coupling with valine benzhydryl ester and deprotection with triflouroacetic TFA to give the heteropeptide as the disulphide.The cell free extracts of P. chrvsoQenua AS P 78 5 20 mg of protein ml were incubated at 250C for 30 minutes in a reaction mixture containing 30mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8.1, O.lmM FeSO, 6mM DTT, 3mM Na ascorbate and 3mMPOCV. The pH was adjusted to 2.0.The cyclization of POCV by isopenicillin N synthetase extracted from P. chrosoaenum generated penicillin V. Controls performed individually without subtrate POCV and without enzyme were negative. The results are given in Table 3 below.

POCV was prepared as described inExample 5. The cyclase was extracted from A. chrysopenum AS C 80 and incubated in the reaction mixture described in Example 5, with the exception that the pH of the Tris buffer was 7.8.The results of the incubation of the cyclase with POCV are shown in Table 4.
