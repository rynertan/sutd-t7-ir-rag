# Furniture units.

## Abstract
A lock arrangement 1 for office furniture units 2 , such as desks, that include one or more pedestals 3 each defining at least one closable compartment 4 in the nature of a drawer or cupboard having a mechanism 5 to lock the compartment closed, and a top 6 extending the length of the unit. The lock arrangement is particularly adapted for in top installations, and comprises a primary lock 7 mounted in the top, and a channel 8 which opens downwardly from the lower surface of the top adjacent the forward edge 9 thereof. A connector device 10 is mounted within the channel 8 , and mechanically inter connects the primary lock 7 with the compartment lock mechanism 5 , such that manipulation of the primary lock locks and unlocks the compartment. A removable cover assembly encloses the channel, and comprises two covers 12, 13 which are positioned over opposite end portions of the channel 8 . The end covers have oppositely oriented slide latches 14 , whereby longitudinal divergence of the end covers detachably fastens the same to the channel. A third cover 15 is inserted between the interior ends of the end covers 12, 13 to enclose the media portion of the channel 8 and prevent convergence of the end covers from the locked position. A lock mechanism 122, 134, 81, 128 retains the centre cover in the locked position, and is preferably connected with the primary lock 7 , such that shifting the primary lock also locks and unlocks the centre cover to permit only author ized access to the lock arrangement.
