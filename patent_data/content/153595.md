# Apparatus and method for mounting a head on a musical instrument.

## Abstract
A removable head for a musical instrument such a a drum, tambourine or banjo is formed from a polymeric sheet 12 stretched across the opening in a member, such as an annular hoop 14 , having a channel formed along the edge thereof and at least partially filled with adhesive. The film 12 is attached to the member with substantial tension for it to provide an effective musical tone. The member to which the film is attached can therefore be simply secured to the shell of the instrument.
