# Liquid loaded pad for medical applications.

## Abstract
Liquid loaded pads useful as wound and burn dressings are prepared from policies of microbially producod cellulose obtained, for example, by culturing Acetobacter xylinum. A pellicle having a thickness from about 0.1 to 15 millimeters or greater is processed to replace the culture medium with water or other physiologically compatible liquid. The liquid loaded pellicle is sterilized prior to its use as a dressing or in other medical applications.
