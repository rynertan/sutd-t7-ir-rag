# A DEVICE TO TRANSFER LABELS OR ADHESIVE TAGS PREVIOUSLY DETACHED FROM A SILICONATED BASE BETWEEN TWO HANDLING STATIONS

## Abstract
A device to transfer labels 12 or adhesive tags detached from a siliconated base 13 between two handling stations comprising at least one conveyor belt 19a driven by two pulleys 20a, 21a rotatably driven by a motor through a driving device 26 is characterized by the fact that the transport surface of said conveyor belt 19a is provided by suitably spaced apart, transversal projecting portion. The pulley 21a arranged at the outlet zone has side flanges 22 emending beyond the projecting portions of the belt, to help the separation of the label 12 from said belt 19a .
