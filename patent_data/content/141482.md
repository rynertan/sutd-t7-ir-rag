# A PLASTERING HAWK AND METHOD OF PLASTERING UTILISING THE SAME

## Abstract
A plastering hawk preferably of polypropylene, has an elongate handle 1 and a plate 2 attached to one end of the handle, which plate extends in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the handle. One edge portion 5 of the plate extends away from the handle at an acute angle to the axis of the handle. In use the acute angled portion of the plate is butted against a work surface and plaster on the hawk is moved across the acutely angled portion 5 into the work surface, thus providing a smooth transition onto the work surface.
