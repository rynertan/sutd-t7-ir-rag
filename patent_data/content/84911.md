# Pulse generator comprising at least two voltage comparison circuits.

## Abstract
A pulse generator PG for generating pulses having pulse edges at instants at which a valving input voltage VS is substantially equal to one of at least two threshold values DC1, DC2 produced by a voltage source UV . The pulse generator PG comprises at least two voltage comparison circuits VG2, VG1 each having first T13, T15 and second outputs T14, T16 , first T2, T6 and second inputs T3, T7 for receiving two voltages to be compared and third T1, T5 and fourth inputs T4, T8 for applying blocking voltages thereto which block the voltage com parison circuits VG2, VG1 between the first T2, T6 and the second inputsk T3, T7 and the first T13, T15 and the second outputs T14, T16 respectively. The first T6 or the second input T3 , respectively of each voltage comparison circuit VG1, VG2 is coupled to an input VT of the pulse generator PG and the further inputs to the voltage source UV . The outputs T13, T14, T15, T16 of the voltage comparison circuits VG2, VG1 are coupled to each other and to an output PT of the pule generator PG via diodes D1, D2, D5, D3, D4, D6 which are separately biased for each voltage comparison circuit VG2, VG1 .
