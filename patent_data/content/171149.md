# Electronic tracking system for microwave antennas.

## Abstract
A directive antenna for a groundstation or a satellite has a plurality of discrete receptional states which provide predeter mined electronic displacements from boresight of the optimum direction of reception. The direction of the target is obtained by rapid switching from one receptional mode to another. The receptional modes are preferably provided by switchable mode converters. e. g. 6A, 6B, 7A and 7B, which are coupled with the waveguide so as to convert higher order propagation modes, e. g. TM01, TE21 H and TE21 V , to the fundamental.
