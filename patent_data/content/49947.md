# Motor control system.

## Abstract
A control system for a brushless direct current motor 10 providing linear closed loop speed control when the motor is operating near its desired speed and providing pulse width modulation closed loop speed control when the motor is not operating near its desired speed. A current sensing feedback loop 18, 20, 14, 16 is provided to drive the transistor 16 linearly controlling the electronic commuta tion 30 of the motor into pulse width modulation when the current through the motor 10 exceeds a predetermined value. An inductor 24 may be coupled in series with control transistor 16 and positive feedback 26 may be supplied to current sensor 18, 20 .
