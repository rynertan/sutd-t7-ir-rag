# Human transforming growth factor and precursor or fragment thereof, cells, DNA, vectors and methods for their production, compositions and products containing them, and related antibodies and diagnostic methods.

## Abstract
Recombinant DNA technology is used to produce the transforming growth factor α TGF α precursor and its fragments. TGF α precursor and its fragments, including particularly mature TGF α, and optionally in combination with human transforming growth factor β, has utility for example in the therapeutic treatment of human beings for bone diseases and to accelerate wound healing. In addition, TGF α is useful as an adjuvant for cell culture so as to reduce requirements for serum in the culture media thereby resulting in purification advantages , and to stimulate or enhance cell growth in cell culture. Also, preparation of large quantities of the TGF α precursor and its fragments enables the preparation of reagents for the assay of the TGF α precursor and its fragments in body fluids for the diagnosis of neoplastic or other diseases.
