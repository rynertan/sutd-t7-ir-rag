## Description
AGROCHEMICAL FORMULATIONS This invention relates to agrochemical formulations1 and more particularly to agrochemical formulations containing triazoles. Recently a class of substituted triazoles has been found to have numerous members with a variety of uses in agriculture. Such triazoles have the general formula I EMI1.1 wherein Z is N or CH , and X is a saturated or unsaturated carbon chain having 2, 3 or more chain carbon atoms, the chain carrying on its second or third carbon atom an oxygen to eitner in the form o a hydroxy group or an ester thereof or in the form of a carbonyl group or a derivative thereof, e.g. a ketal, and the chain optionally carrying one or two further oxygen atoms as defined above and or at least one optionally substituted alkyi, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, aralkeny oxy, or heterocyclic group or an acid addition salt or metal complex thereof. The main uses which compounds of this type display are as fungicides, particularly against powdery mildews of cereals Erysiphe graminis and in some cases cereal rusts for example Puccinia recondita on wheat, Puccinia horde on barley as plant growth regulators, in particular as stunting or dwarfing agents leading to the development of smalier plants with darker green leaves and, in certain cases, as herbicides. Examples cf sub classes of this class are the follcwing EMI2.1 EMI2.2 where R is phenyl, phenoxy or benzyl, optionally substituted in each case, and R is C1 C6 alkyl, in particular tert butyl, or optionally substituted phenyl. Specific examples of such compounds are the mild fungicide of formula III above, in which R is w chlorophenoxy and R is tert butyl, common name triadi mefon, and its analogues disclosed in U.K. PatentSpecification No. 1364619 to Bayer AG the mildew and rust fungicide of formula II above, in which R 15 2,4 dichlorobenzyl and RÚ is tert butyl and the plant growth regulator of formula II above in which R is 4 csloronenzyl and R is tert butyl and their analogues disclosed in our Dutch Patent Application 7709197.Other suitable compounds are disclosed in Dutch PatentApplications 7602502, 7609439, 7613372, 7708424 and 7709443 French Patent Specifications 2323689 and 2354324 British Patent Specifications 1492882 and 1504352 and German Offenlegungsschrifts 2802496 and 2859379. Compounds or the type set forth above are herein after referred to as substituted triazole s as herein defined . Substituted triazoles, as herein defined, being active at low rates, are well suited to agricultural application by the known ULV ultra low volume technique. This method uses relatively concentrated liquid formulations containing e.g. 1 to 50 by weight of active ingredient, and a correspondingly low rate of application of the formulation per hectare, e.g. 0.5 10 litres per hectare, in contrast with more usual high volume spray rates of 200 500 litres per hectare, or more. ULV formulations are in several respects safer than conventional high volume sprays, because they do not require dilution, with the attendant risk of dilution errors or spillages.With such relatively concentrated solutions, it is important to ensure that as much as possible of the formulatIon goes and stays where it needed, i.e. on the plants being sprayed, and as little as possible is misdirected onto the ground or carried away bv the ind. For this purpose, it is useful to applv electrostaticallv charged sprays. These are attracted to the foliage of plants electrostatic orces carry the to the underside of leaves as well as to the top surfaces, ana eve coating is promoted.Hitherto electrostatic sparaying of pesticides has not been widely adopted, for lack of convenient, reliable and cheap spraying apparatus. A suitable apparatus is however no available, and is described in U.K. patent Application 29539 76 U.S. Serial No. 812440 . We have also found that ultra low volume sprays of substituted triazoles as herein defined are biologically more e ective in the form of small droplets e.g. below 100 microns in diameter. Such droplets are particularly prone to drift unless electrostaticaly charged. The object of the present invention is to provide 2 class of agrochemical compositions particularly suited to ULV electrostatic spraying, in Dartic alar by appa ratus of the type described in U.K. Patent Application 29539 76 U.S. Serial 812440 . According to the present invention we provide an electrostatically sprayable ready for use agrochemical tormulation comprising a solution of from 1 to 8 of a substituted triazole as herein defined in an organic solvent medium, the formulation having a resistivity at 20 0C in the range 1 x 106 to 1 x 10 ohm centimetre and viscosity at 20C of 1 to 50 centlstokes. We find that solutions according to the invention are readily sprayed at satisfactory rates using the apparatus of U.K. Patent Application No 29539 76 U.S.Serial 812440 and will give a range of mean spray droplet sizes of from about 50 to about 200 microns in diameter, according to the strength of the electrostatic field applied to them the stronger the field the smaller the droplets , flow rate through the apparatus and other operating conditions. The resistivity of solutions according to the invention is conveniently measured by measuring the resistance of a cell of standard dimensions containing the solution held at a temperature of 20 C, using, for example, a Keithley electrometer. It is preferred that the resistivity of the solutions be In the range 107 to 9 10 ohm centimetres. The viscosity of solutions according to the invention is conveniently measured by timing the flow of a measured quantity of the solution through a hole of known size as is done, for example, in the Redwood viscometer . It is preferred that the viscosity of the solutions is in the range 2 to 20 centistokes. The resistivity and viscosity of the solutions depend primarily on the properties of the solvents used to make them, though they are also affected by the nature and amount of the dIssolved substituted triazole. One way of obtaining the desired properties is to mix solvents having various resistivities and viscosities. High boiling hydrocarbon solvents, e.g. Solvesso 150, are convenient and relatively cheap, but usually have low viscosities e.g. of the order of 3 centistokes and high resistivities e.g. of the order of 1011 ohm centimetres . To bring down the resistivity of these materials, they may be mIxed with polar solvents such as alcohols and in particular ketonic solvents. These have lower resistivities but are also usually not viscous enough for example, the useful solvent cyclohexanone has a resistivity of about 2 x 10 ohm centimetres, but a viscosity of only about 3 centistokes. However the viscosity of the solution may be increased by addition of more viscous oil soluble solvents, for example polybutenes e.g. Hyvis Trademark and long chain chlorinated hydrocarbon products such as Cereclor Trademark C42 or C48. The latter has a high resistivity, greater than 1010 ohm centimetres, and a hig viscosity, of the order of 100 centistokes. By suitable adjustment of the proportions of three solvents such as these, a solution of the desired properties can easily be obtained. The resistivity of solvents and solutions is easily affected by the presence of water or other contnminants. It is not necessary always to use ult a ure materials, but consistent results will only be obtained from materials of consistent composition and formulations which have been made up with the desired properties should thereafter be protected from an further con tamination, especially by water. Another way of producing a solution with the required properties is to make up a solution of the required viscosity but excessive resistivity e.g. from a mix ture of hydrocarbons and long chain chlorinated hydrocarbons and then dose this with an antistatic agent to reduce the resistivity to the desired level A suitable antistatic agent is sold for use as a static charge issicator with hydrocarbon fuels under the name ASA it consists of a complex mixture of copper ana chromium cations with various organic acid amnions. Other similar materials, e.g. copper oleates, may also be used. This technique is not generally suitable by itself for producing solutions having a resistivity below about 108 ohm centimetres. Examples of substituted triazoles suitable for use in the solutions of the invention include triadimefon and the compounds of formula III listed below inTable I.
