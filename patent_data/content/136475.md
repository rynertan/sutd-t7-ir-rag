Recently, growth hormone releasing factors GRF of human pancreatic islet tumor origin hpGRF were isolated, characterized, and shown to possess growth hormone GH releasing activity in rat anterior pituitary in vitro and in vivo by 1 R. Guillemin, P.Brazeau, P. BÃ¶hlen, F. Esch, N. Ling, and W. B.Wehrenberg Science, 218, 585 1982 1 and 2 J.Spiess, J. Rivier, M. Thorner. and W. Vale Biochemistry, 21, 6037 1982 j. Further. a synthetic hp GRF 1 29 NH2, an amidated fragment of the natural hpGRF, was reported to possess fu l intrinsic biological activity by Spiess et al. ,f reverence 2 .

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, this objective is achieved by replacing the natural amino acids in positions 1, 2, and 3, as well as derivatizing the N terminal amino acid residue in hpGRF 1 to 29, 1 to 40 and 1 to 44 as expressed below by the structural formulas I , II , and III respectively.

Other abbreviations used in the present specification are Fmoc fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl Boc t butyloxycarbonyl Tos E toluenesulfonyl hplc high performance liquid chromatography tlc thin layer chromatography TFA trifluoroacetic acid Ac acetyl Solid phase synthesis of the Formulas I , II , and III peptides can be carried out on a Beckman 990 automatic peptide synthesizer. Preparative HPLC can be performed on a thick walled glass column 2.5 x 45 cm containing Whatman LRP 1 reverse phase packing C18 silica 13 20 um pumped with Fluid Metering Company pump and pulse damper.Amino acid analyses can be run on a Beckman 119 CL analyzer and processed with a System AA computing integrator. Amino acid derivatives utilized in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention are available from several chemical supply houses including Bachem, Inc., Torrance, California, and ChemicalDynamics, Inc., Plainfield, New Jersey. The peptides having the Formulas I , If , and III configurations can be conveniently prepared by standard solid phase techniques for example, theC terminal protected amino acid can be attached to a chloromethyl resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, a benzhydrylamine BHA resin, or a p methylbenzylhydrylamine 2 Me BHA resin. One such chloromethyl resin is sold under the trade name Bio Beads SX l by Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, California. The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by Bodansky et al.,Chem. Ind. London 38, 1597 1966 . The BHA resin has been described by Pietta andtashall, Chem, Commun. 650 1970 and commercially available from Bachem, Inc., Torrance, California. According to an embodiment of the invention, the peptides of Formulas I , II , and III are prepared by means of solid phase peptide synthesis by standard procedures, although it may also be prepared by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide. The a amino protecting group is Fmoc, and the side chain protecting group is t Bu instead of benzyl for the appropriate amino acid when the chloromethyl or hydroxymethyl resin is used. Side chain protection can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with HF to give the free peptide amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides. In preparing the esters of this invention, the resins used to prepare the acids of Formulas I , 11 , and III R2 OH can be employed, and the side chain protected peptide can be cleaved with a base and an appropriate alcohol, i.e., methanol.Side chain protecting groups can then be removed in the usual fashion by treatment with HF to obtain the desired ester. The solid phase procedure discussed above is well known in the art and has been essentially described by Stewart and Young, Solid Phase PeptideSynthesis, Freeman and Company, San Francisco, California 1969 .

The amino acid analysis gave Asp, 2.99 Thr, 1.00 Ser, 2.85 Glu, 2.16 Gly, 1.03 Ala, 3.03 Val, 0.94 Ile, 1.82 Leu, 4.03 Nle, 0.99 Tyr, 1.97 Phe, 0.92 Lys, 2.06 Arg, 3.05. EXAMPLE 23Preparation of D alanineÃª, D aspartic acid , D asparagine8, norleucine27 human pancreatic growth hormone releasing l 29 amide D Ala2, D Asp3, D Asn8, Nle27 hpGRF 1 29 NH2 The peptide benzhydryl resin was prepared as inExample 1 with L norleucine replacing L methionine in position 27 of the coupling cycle. This material was then coupled in the manner described in Example 2 withD alanine replacing L alanine in position 2, D aspartic acid replacing L aspartic acid in position 3 andD asparagine replacing L asparagine in position 8. The yield was 67 mg starting with 0.25 mmole of resin, ad the HPLC elution time was 28 minutes at a flow rate of 1.5 mL minutes. The amino acid analysis gave Asp, 3.01 Thr, 1.00 Ser, 2.90 Glu, 2.20 Gly, 1.05 Ala, 3.08 Val, 0.95 Ile, 1.86 Leu, 4.01 Nle, 0.96 Tyr, 1.95 Phe, 0.93 Lys, 2.05 Arg, 3.11.
