## Description
DEVICE FOR ACTUATING DISC 3RAKES IN MOTORVE IICDES OR EI SEWHEBEn This invention relates to a mechanism for actuating disc brakes in motorvehicles or elsewhere. Known are several brake types, or devices adapted to produce a retarding action which opposes the motion of a machine member or of a machine as a whole. Barring electric brakes, which operate by converting kinetic energy into reusable electric power, the energy dissipated by any brake types is converted into heat. Specifically, currently used disc brakes wherein two friction pads are urged from opposite sides against the faces of a disc mounted rigid with moving parts, the amount of heat developed is considerable. Such brake types, while providing a satisfactory braking effect, are not devoid of shortcomings. In fact, owing to the friction pads being moved by hydraulic pistons, it is not unusual for the working liquid to partly turn into vapor, on account of the high temperatures generated, the compressible nature whereof results in the force applied to the pistons for braking being cancelled or significantly decreased. Another disadvantage of current disc brakes originates from the pressure seal rings of the hydraulic piston in fact, their hardening or, even worse, their breaking results in oil leaking out and the operating pressure level dropping below that required for the braking action, while the leaking oil may easily flow onto the pads and disc, thus Jeopardizing the ability of the brake to develop friction. The poor reliability of hydraulically operated disc brakes makes their application to powerful and heavy industrial vehicles inadvisable0 It is the aim of this invention to obviate such prior drawbacks by providing a mechanism for actuating disc brakes, which drives the pistons acting on the friction pads through a fully mechanical drive arrangement, thus dispensing with the necessity for oil or other liquids under pressure in the direct proximities of the brake disc. Within the above aim, it is an obJect of the invenion to maintain in all situations a good transfer of the braking force to the pads acting on the brake discs. This aim, as well as this and other objects such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a mechanism for actuating disc brakes in motorvehicles or elsewhere, comprising a caliper 2 rigidly associated with the fixed main frame of a motorvehicle and carrying on opposite sides with respect to a disc 3 of a disc brake a pair of friction pads 12 engageable by contact with the opposed faces of said disc 3 , and characterized in that it comprises a box like body 1 rigidly associated with said caliper 2 and accommodating slidably therein a push rod 5 movable parallely to the axis of said disc 3 , said push rod 5 having at least one ramp region 5a,5b in engagement with a first wedge 6 having an inclined face 6a in mutual sliding engagement with one inclined face 8a of a self adjustment wedge 8 adapted to engage, at the opposed face thereof with respect to said first wedge, with a plunger iso acting on a friction pad 12 to engage it with said brake disc 3 . Further features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of a preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of the inventive mechanism, as illustrated by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a side elevation view of a brake disc incorporating a mechanism according to the invention Figure 2 shows in side elevation and top plan views respectively, a detail of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows in full view and in section another detail of a mechanism according to the invention Figure 4 shows two views of a further detail of the mechanism of this invention Figure 5 is a sectional view of Figure 1, taken along the line X X Figure 6 shows in two views and a section the self adjustment wedge according to the invention Figure 7 shows in two views and a section the push rod according to the invention Figure 8 shows in two views and a section the plunger according to the invention and Figure 9 shows two views of the first wedge of this invention. With reference to the drawing views, a device according to the invention comprises a box like body, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which is rigidly associated with a caliper 2 bonded to the fixed main frame of a machine and extends above both faces of a brake disc 3 rigid with a part to be braked. Formed on the interior of the box like body is a seat 4 which accommodates a push rod 5 slidably therein, said push rod extending parallel to the axis of the disc 3 and being movable relatively to the box like body in a substantially parallel direction to its own axis. The push rod 5 has two regions 5a and 5b, respectively, of ramp like configuration, each engaging with a first wedge 6 from opposed sides with respect to the brake disc. In order to minimize wear and friction, between said ramp of the push rod 5 and the first wedge 6, there is provided a roller 7 which is associated rotatably with the first wedge 6. Thus, the first wedge is made movable perpendicularly to the axis of the push rod 5 upon the rod being moved parallely to its own axis. The first wedge is formed with an inclined face 6a slidably mating with an inclined face 8a of a selfadjustment wedge 8 movable in a substantially parallel direction to the axis of the push rod 5. On the side away from this inclined face, the self adjustment wedge engages with a plunger 10 which engages, in turn, with a friction pad 12 through a pad holder 11. Again in order to reduce frictional resistance, between the first wedge and self adjustment wedge, there are provided a first plurality of bearing needles 13, and a second plurality of bearing needles 14 are provided between the first wedge and wall of the boxlike body. To review the individual components in more detail, it may be seen that the push rod is formed at the bottom with a sliding surface 5e adapted to engage with a plurality of shoes 15 carried on a sliding seat 16, shown best in Figure 4, which is rigidly associated with the walls of the seat 4. The push rod 5 further carries, externally and coaxially therewith, a biasing spring 17 having one end engaged with a first ring 18 carried on the push rod 5 and the other end in abutment relationship with a second ring 19 carried in the seat 4. The first wedge 6 has on its push rod side a pair of flanges 6b and 6c wherein a shaft 20 of the roller 7 engages rotatably. The first wedge and self adjustment wedge are formed, on the mutually confronting inclined faces thereof, with guide grooves 6d and 8c, respectively, which accommodates the needles of said first plurality of bearing needles. The self adjustment wedge has on its face away from the face confronting said first wedge a plurality of teeth 8b adapted to engage with a plurality of teeth 21b correspondingly carried on a small plate 21, shown best in Figure 3 and being rigidly associated with the plunger 10. Across the self adjustment wedge, moreover, there extends in a substantially perpendicular direction to its direction of movement in operation a guide seat 8d accommodating a rod 22 and selfadjustment spring 23. The rod 22 abuts, under the bias from the self adjustment spring 23, against a wall of the box like body such as to urge the self adjustment wedge to slide against the plunger. Thus, automatic adjustment of the mechanism is achieved as the friction pads wears, since the tooth pluralities only permit for movement of the self adjustment wedge in one direction. For completeness of illustration, it should be added that the box like body is provided with a reaction plug 24, shown best in Figure 2, which defines, with its inside surface, a guide sliding seat 24a in the box like body for the first wedge. As mentioned, in order to reduce friction between the first wedge and this surface, there are provided a second plurality of bearing needles 14. The operation of the inventive mechanism may be appreciated from the foregoing description. On applying the brake, the push rod is driven along its own axis, either mechanically or hydraulic ally, and caused to move, through the roller 7, the first wedge 6 which becomes operative to shift the self adjustment wedge and, accordingly, the plunger which urges, in turn, the friction pad against the brake disc. It has been found that, in actual practice, a mechanism as provided by the invention achieves, with wedges ensuring that the drive takes place through ramp surfaces, an increase of the actuating force which contributes to the reliability of the braking system as a whole. Furthermore, where the push rod is actuated hydraulically, the working liquid is kept away from the contact area of the pads with the disc, and hence away from areas liable to attain high temperatures. In the course of actual tests, it has been found that best results, as regards drive, increasing actuating force and operation, are to be achieved with the inclined faces of the push rod and wedges set at an inclination angle of 150. The above description makes reference to a mechanism acting on both faces of the brake disc, but it should be understood that, similarly to other braking systems for automobiles, this mechanism could also use a single operational unit and the caliper left floating. It should be further added that, owing to the simple form of actuation provided, the inventive mechanism may be implemented in modular assemblies to be mounted in banks for simultaneously braking several brake discs through the actuation of a single push rod arranged to act against all of the first wedges in the braking arrangement. The mechanism as disclosed is susceptible to many modifications and changes without departing from the scope of this inventive idea further, all of the details may be replaced with technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention, the materials used, as well as the dimensions, may be any ones contingent on individual requirements and the state of the art.
