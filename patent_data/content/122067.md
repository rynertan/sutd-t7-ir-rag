# A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus with surface treated spiral element.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus is desclosed. The scroll members are made of aluminum or aluminum alley to reduce the weight of the apparatus. The scroll members are finished by end mill and applied a electrolytic or chemical pol ishing to improve the roughness of mating surface. At least one scroll is treated by alumite after polishing to reduce the wearing due to contact between both scroll members. Therefore the sealing of fluid pockets between both scroll members can be maintained during along use of the apparatus.
