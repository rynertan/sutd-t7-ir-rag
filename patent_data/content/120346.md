# Apparatus for shaping a proximal tibial surface.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an apparatus for prepar ing the proximal surface of a tibia to receive a proximal timial prosthesis employing a reamer alignment guide 10 which is used to internally locate the central long axis of the tibia and a plateau planer 30 which cooperatively engages with a guide handle 15 attached to the reamer alignment guide 10 to accomplish the shaping of the proximal tibial surface. The reamer alignment guide 10 has a rod portion 12 extending into the interior of the tibial shaft whose central long axis corresponds with the central long axis of the tibia. The guide handle 15 is concentric with that rod portion 12 such that the plateau planer 30 assumes the proper alignment with respect to the central long axis of the tibia such that the proximal tibial surface is shaped relative to that axis in a simple and accurate manner.
