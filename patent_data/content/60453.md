# NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED CROSS FEED FACING UNIT FOR MULTIPLE SPINDLE HEAD MACHINE TOOLS

## Abstract
A cross feed facing unit for use on a multiple spindle head machine tool includes a frame 28 into which a hollow bore spindle 40 is rotatably journaled. Integrated to the end of the spindle 40 distal from the fram 28 is a flange fastened to which is a housing 36 . The housing has a slot or channel 92 inscribed therein which extends diametri cally across the housing so as to be in communication with the spindle bore 78 . A tool carrying cross feed facing slide 97 is disposed in the channel 92 , in the housing 36 and is reciprocated diametrically across the housing by a drawbar 108 disposed in the spindle bore 78 . When the drawbar 108 is reciprocated along the axis by the motor 152 under numerical control, the drawbar 108 rotatably drives a set of pinion gears 106a, 106b, 106c, 106d each journaled in the bore 78 of the spindle 40 so that one of the pinion gears 106a meshingly drives a rack 102 on the underside of the slide 97 to bias the rack and the slide within the housing channel 92 .
