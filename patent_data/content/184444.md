# Permanently antistatic thermoplastic molding composition.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a permanently antistatic, injection moldable thermoplastic composition comprising a polybutylene terephthalate resin having an intrinsic viscosity in the range of about 0.7 to about 1.4 deciliters per gram measured in ortho chlorophenol at 25 C., an antistatic dopant comprising an electron acceptor compound, an electron donor compound, and polytetrafluoroethylene, and less than about 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the molding composition of carbon fibers having lengths of about 0.1 to 1.0 inch 2.5 to 25 mm . Such a molding composition exhibits a volume resistivity of less than 1 10‚Å∏ ohm cm, exceptional low wear performance, excellent mechanical properties, and ease of manufacture.
