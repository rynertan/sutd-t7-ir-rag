## Description
COEXTRUDED THERMOPLASTIC STRETCH WRAP The present invention relates to thermoplastic film structures, in particular laminate plastic film structures which have been formed utilizing coextrusion techniques. The laminate comprises a core of a linear low density polyethylene having exterior skin layers of low density polyethylene, i.e., conventional polyethylene prepared utilizing the prior art free radical high pressure polymerization process. The use of thermoplastic stretch wrap for the over wrap packaging of goods, in particular the unitizing of pallet loads, is a currently commercially developing end use application for thermoplastic films, inc uding polyethylene. There are a variety of overwrapping techniques which are employed utilizing such stretch wrap films, including locating the pallet load to be wrapped atop a rotating platform. As polyethylene film is laid on about the girth of the pallet load, the pallet load is rotated on its platform.The polyethylene stretch wrap is applied from a continuous roll thereof. Breaking tension is applied to the continuous roll of film so that the film is being continuously stretched by the rotating pallet load.Usually the stretch wrap film located adjacent to the rotating pallet load is vertically positioned and the rotating platform or turntable may be operated at speeds ranging from about 5 up to about 50 revolutions per minute. At the completion of the overwrap operation the turntable is stopped completely while the film is cut and attached to the previous layer of film employing tack sealing, tape, spray adhesives or a cling modified film whereby overlapping layers of the stretch wrap have a pronounced tendency to cling together at their interface.Depending upon the width of the stretch film roll, the load being overwrapped may be shrouded in the film while the vertically positioned film roll remains fixed in a vertical position, or the vertically positioned film roll e.g. in the case of relatively narrow film widths and relatively wider pallet loads may be arranged to move in a vertical direction as the load is being overwrapped whereby a spiral wrapping effect is achieved on the packaged goods. Stretch films employed in the prior art have included film materials such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and ethylene vinyl acetate. With respect of the ethylene vinyl acetate type of stretch film products, the prior art has employed a percentage by weight of vinyl acetate in the copolymers of about 2 up to about 15 and preferably from about 4GO up to about 12 by weight for stretch film applications. Physical properties which are particularly significant for the successful use of thermoplastic films in stretch wrap applications include their puncture resistance, their elongation characteristics, their toughness and their resistance to tearing while under tension. In particular, the latter physical characteristics of such film, i.e., their resistance to tearing and their resistance to puncture, are particularly significant. In general tensile toughness is measured as an area under a stress strain curve for a thermoplastic film, or it may be considered as the tensile energy absorbed, expressed in units of ft. lbs. in.cu. to elongate a film to break under tensile load. In turn, this toughness characteristic is a function of the capacity of such films to elongate.The process of stretching the film decreases that capacity. Accordingly, the stretch wrap process will decrease the toughness of the film while it is in its stretched condition as an overwrap as compared to unstretched counterparts, including such materials as shrink wrap. Generally this loss of toughness is proportional to the amount of stretch imparted to the film as it is overwrapping a load of goods. As hereinabove indicated, the resistance to tear characteristic of such films will be obviously an important physical characteristic for stretch wrap application since if the edge of the stretch film roll is nicked, abraded or in any way weakened before stretching or during the stretching operation, premature tearing of the film will usually occur during wrapping or subsequent handling of the load of goods. In practice one commonly accepted technique for properly tensioning a film around a load such as a palletized load is to adjust the breaking force on the roll until a significant amount of neck in i.e. film width reduction occurs. Alternatively film may be tensioned until an initiated tear results in unrestricted propagation of the tear across the film width. It is an object of the present invention to provide a stretch film material which, unlike currently commercially available stretch films, is a laminar structure comprising at least two and preferably three film layers. The prior art stretch film materials hereinabove referred to, such as polyvinyl chloride, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and low density polyethylene, have been found to offer reduced resistance to tear in both the film s machine direction and transverse direction as well as reduced toughness and elongation characteristics in contrast to the laminar film compositions of the present invention. In accordance with the present invention a stretch wrap material is provided which comprises a primary layer of a linear low density polyethylene film, which primary layer has a coating on at least one side thereof comprising a highly branched low density polyethylene fabricated utilizing a high pressure free radical polymerization process. Linear low density polyethylenes include ethylene which has been copolymerized with minor amounts of another olefinic material including such materials as octene 1, 4 methyl pentene 1 and butene 1. As hereinbefore discussed, the present invention comprises the formation of a laminar stretch wrap thermo plastic film by initially preparing the coextruded stretch wrap product utilizing conventional coextrusion techniques. The material construction of the laminate prepared in accordance with the following example comprises a core layer of linear low density polyethylene, the linear low density material comprising ethylene which has been copolymerized with a minor amount of octene 1. The exterior skin layers are fabricated from low density polyethylene resin produced by the high pressure process. The high pressure low density polyethylene skin layer provides the requisite cling and gloss properties necessary for stretch film applications. The linear low density polyethylene which contains the core layer imparts the desired tear and puncture resistance as well as the toughness which is required of a film in such a new use application. In the following Table A the physical properties of the low density polyethylene and the linear low density polyethylene resins which were employed to fabricate the films identified as X 1, X 2 and X 3 reported in Table 2 are set forth below TABLE A LLDPE LLDPE LLDPE Core Core CoreLDPE SKINS X 1 X 2 X 3Density g cc 0.9202 0.9228 0.9186Melt Index 2.3 2.1 2.4Molecular Weight Wt.

One layer had a density of 0.925 and a melt index of 1.4. The second layer had a density of 0.918 and a melt index of 7.0. EXAMPLE 1 Linear low density polyethylene as hereinabove defined was fed into the feed hopper of a conventional rotating screw extruder. The extruder screw employed has a 6 diameter and a length to diameter ratio of about 24 1. The satellite extruder which was employed for the extrusion of the hereinabove low density polyethylene X 3 material comprised a conventional extruder having an extruder screw witha 3.5 diameter and a length to diameter ratio of about 24 1. Molten resin from the satellite extruder was fed into the cast film die affixed to the end of the core extruder, through an adapter specifically designed to join the polymer stream from the satellite extruder to the molten polymer core stream so that it covers and encompasses the molten surfaces of the core layer.
