# RINSING MACHINE

## Abstract
A rinsing machine for articles A of glassware or the like comprises a pair of endless conveyors 10, 10 , each of the conveyors defining a travel path comprising a flight path 12 and a return path 14 . Each flight path 12 extends from a lower level article intake segment 16 , through an upwardly extending article inversion segment 18 , along an upper flight segment 20 of appreciable length, through a downwardly extending article re inversion segment 22 , and to a lower level article discharge segment 24 . Each return path 14 is generally parallel to, but horizontally spaced from, the flight path 12 . The machine also includes converging wheels 38, 38 for bringing the conveyors 10, 10 into article grasping juxtaposition at the article intake segment 16 , diverging wheels 40, 40 for bringing the conveyors into article releas ing juxtaposition at the article discharge segment 24 , and re taining guides 170a for retaining the conveyors in the article grasping juxtaposition between the article intake and article discharging segments 16, 24 . The articles traveling along the upper flight segments are rinsed, and then allowed to drip dry.
