# CONNECTING SYSTEM BETWEEN THE PEDALS AND THE DRIVING SPROCKET OF A VELOCIPEDE, WATERCRAFT OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
A connecting system between pedals and driving sprocket of a velocipede, watercraft or the like, comprising a mass holding lever, having one end connected to the pedal journal and bearing a mass at its opposite, free end pedal crank means coupled to the driving sprocket by means of spokes and slots allowing a relative sliding be tween the spokes and slots a bracket integral with the driving sprocket, projecting outwardly form said sprocket and having a tie rod hinged at its free end a tie rod connected with its opposite end to a point close to the journaling axis of the pedals on the massholding lever, eccentric with respect to said axis the mass holding lever having an amplitude of swing ing around the journaling axis, determined and limited by the length of the adjustable tie rod the eccentricity of the hinging point of said tie rod with respect to the axis of the pedals causing a torque acting on the mass holding lever in a clockwise direction, with consequent partial lifting of said lever due to the relative sliding of spokes, pedal cranks and driving sprocket upon an effort being exerted on the pedals by the user such lifting helping the movement of said lever toward its top dead center, after which the lever in its fall will impart its own momentum to the motion of the main driving sprocket.
