## Description
The present invention relates to a radio transmission system which has particular application in local area radio systems such as paging or cordless telephones. The present invention also relates to a radio receiving system for use in the radio transmission system. In many radio systems, transmitters are located at several sites with the result that a receiver receives at different field strengths signals in the selected channel as well as in adjacent channels. Consequently the receiver is constructed to provide image and adjacent channel rejection of the order of 70dB or more which makes the receiver expensive. A system in which a plurality of different signals are transmitted from a single site is described in a paper entitled 26 GHz Band Digital Subscriber Radio System 26SS D1 for High Speed Digital Communications which was given at the IEEE International Conference on Communications 1985, Chicago, Illinois, 23rd 26th June 1985 by Hiroshi Nakayama et al and printed at Vol. 2 of 3 pages 729 734 of the conference record. This paper describes a high speed point to multipoint digital communications subscriber system for line of sight communication of computer, video and other data. Signals in the 26 GHz band are used and the inter channel separation is 40 MHz. An object of the present invention is to provide a radio transmission system and a receiving system therefor which are less susceptible to image and adjacent channel interference. According to the present invention there is provided a radio transmission system comprising transmitter means for transmitting with substantially equal powers a plurality of different signals in respective frequency channels from a single site, the frequency channels being contiguous and together forming a block of frequency channels and at least one receiver characterised in that the receiver is tunable, and in that the receiver includes means for generating a signal and means for mixing an input signal with the locally generated signal to receive a wanted signal and to produce an image signal which wanted and image signals are both frequency converted from within the block of frequency channels. The present invention also provides a receiving system comprising at least one receiver for use with a radio transmission system in which a plurality of different signals having substantially equal powers are transmitted in respective frequency channels from a single site, the frequency channels being contiguous and together forming a block of frequency channels, characterised in that the receiver is tunable, and in that the receiver includes means for generating a signal and means for mixing an input signal with the locally generated signal to receive a wanted signal and to produce an image signal which wanted and image signals are both frequency converted from within the block of frequency channels. By all the signal channels in a block of contiguous channels being transmitted from a single site at substantially equal powers, then the wanted and unwanted signals are at the same level and a limited degree, of the order of 30dB, of adjacent channel rejection is adequate for acceptable reception. Mixing a received signal with a locally generated signal having a frequency selected to produce an image signal which is frequency converted from within the block of channels ensures that signals from other systems operating on nearby frequencies are not received at significant power levels. Because the wanted and image signals are at the same level and because the signals come from the same transmitter, a limited degree of image rejection of the order of 30dB is adequate for acceptable performance. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring to Figure 1, the illustrative radio system comprises five transmitters or transceivers 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 connected to a single antenna 20 or to respective antennas located on the same site. One or more receivers or transceivers 22, 24 are provided. The receivers 22, 24 may be fixedly sited or mobile. In operation the transmitters 10 to 18 are allocated individual channels in a block 50 Figure 2 of contiguous channels and each transmits its signal at substantially the same power as the different signals transmitted by the other transmitters. Thus at each receiver 22, 24 the transmitted signals are received at the same relative strength because there is a high degree of correlation in the path loss for signals separated in frequency by less than the auto covariance bandwidth. However the strength of the signals received by any one receiver may be different from that experienced by other receivers. In any event since all the signals in the block of channels received by any one receiver are at the same level as the wanted channel then limited adjacent channel performance is acceptable. Consequently a lower performance specification receiver can be used to obtain this limited degree about 30dB of rejection which is adequate for acceptable reception. When demodulating a signal it is necessary to distinguish a wanted signal from an unwanted image signal having the same i.f. This situation is illustrated in Figure 2 where A is the wanted signal in the block 50 of channels and A is the unwanted image signal as a result of the frequency difference between the local oscillator frequency F A suitable direct conversion phasing receiver is illustrated in Figure 3. The receiver comprises first and second mixers 30, 32, each having an input coupled to an antenna 28. A local oscillator 34 is connected to the first mixer 30, and, If desired the 90 degree phase shifter 36 could be arranged in the signal path to one or other of the first and second mixers 30, 32 and the low pass filters 38, 40 may be incorporated into their associated mixers 30, 32. The local oscillator 34 may be implemented as a frequency synthesiser which means that it can be controlled intelligently so as to utilise the block of channels more efficiently. Referring to Figure 2, outside the block 50 of channels, signals may exist with significantly different field strengths. Thus in the case of selecting a signal, such as B, near the end of the block, there is a risk that the image B , lying outside the block 50, is much stronger and cannot be rejected satisfactorily in the receiver. One solution to this problem is not to transmit signals near the ends of the block 50 but this represents an inefficient use of the spectrum. A better solution is to programme the frequency synthesiser so that it generates a local oscillator frequency to produce an image within the block. Consequently the channels at either end of the block 50 can be used. The preprogramming of the frequency synthesiser can be done in a number of ways. One is to store the identification of the problematic channels near the ends of the block and choose a suitable local oscillator frequency or divider number to obtain an image within the block. Another way is to determine the centre frequency of the block 50 and programme the frequency synthesiser so that for a channel below the centre frequency the local oscillator frequency is higher than the carrier frequency of the selected channel and for a channel above the centre frequency the local oscillator frequency is lower than the carrier frequency of the selected channel.
