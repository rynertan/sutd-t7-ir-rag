# Device for transferring control or drive signals or pulses between machine portions in mutual rotation relationship, particularly in a circular knitting machine.

## Abstract
To transfer electric control signals between a stationary portion and rotary portion of a machine, in particular a circular knitting machine, a device is disclosed which comprises two optical fiber cables 21, 22 respectively attached, the one to the stationary portion and the other to the rotary portion, and arranged to axially face each other on the rotation axis of the machine rotary portion such that the light flux can be transfer red from one fiber to the other. An electro optical element converts the electric signals, which may be of the digital type, into optical signals, which are applied to one of the optical fiber cables 21, 22 and then received on the other cable through a coupling for free relative coaxial rotation. The sign als are again converted into electric signals through an opto electric element, and then processed to control machine actuators. The transfer arrangement is free of any sliding electric contacts and unaffected by noise and interference.
