As analgesic agents compounds of formula I are like morphine and codeine but superior to aspirin or acetaminophen as shown in the trypsin assay and the hot plate assay. However, the analgesic mode of action of the compounds of formula I is believed to be unlike that of morphine or codeine since their analgesic activity is not inhibited by naloxone, and they do not bind to the morphine receptor. Thus compounds of formula I are considered non narcotic.The duration of analgesic action is significantly greater for compounds of formula I than for codeine or morphine.Compounds of formula I have also been found te have potent, long lasting acute anti inflammatory activity in the rat as shown in the carrageenan pleurisy assay Vinegar et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 151, 556, 1976 . Compounds of formula I resemble acetaminophen in their acute anti inflammatory action but may have been found to be more potent and to have a longer lasting anti inflammatory effect at comparable dose levels. Compounds of formula I , like acetaminophen, have also been found to have antipyretic and hypothermic activity as shown by the yeast induced hyperthermia assay in the rat Khalili Varasteh et al., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 219, 149 159 1976 j. This is to say, the compounds of formula I combat fever in the rat as does aspirin and acetominophen.Compounds of formula I may be used in the relief, treatment or prophylaxis of pain moderate to severe , inflammation or fever, in a mammal, including man, such as that resulting from headache, toothache, pain following general dental procedures, oral and general surgery, dysmenorrhea, myalgia, pain of unresectable cancer, joint and peripheral nerve disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, pyresis and other conditions associated with pain, inflammation and fever.The amount of the active compound, i.e. compound of formula I , required for use in the above conditions will, of course, vary both with the route of administration, the condition under treatment, and the mammal undergoing treatment, but is ultimately at the discretion of the physician. However, a suitable analgesic, anti inflammatory and or anti pyretic dose of the active compound for a mammal is in the range of from 3 to 120 mg per kilogram bodyweight per day a typical dose for a human recipient being 15 mg kg bodyweight per day.The desired dose is preferably presented as a divided dose in the range of from two to four subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Thus where three sub doses are employed each will lie in the range of from 1 to 20 mg base kg body weight, a typical dose for a human recipient being 3 mg base kg body weight. While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active compound as a pharmaceutical formulation. Formulations of the present invention, both for veterinary and for human medical use, comprise the active compound together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier s must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The other therapeutic ingredient s may include other analgesics such as codeine anti inflammatories or anti pyretics. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration.The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active compound into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound as a powder or granules or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or a draught. The active compound may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory Ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active compound being in a freeflowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent,surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, comprising a mixture of the powdered active compound with any suitable carrier.A syrup may be made by adding the active compound to a concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar, for example sucrose, to which may also be added any accessory ingredient. Such accessory ingredient s may include flavourings, an agent to retard crystallization of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as polyhydric alcohol for example glycerol or sorbitol.Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a usual carrier such as cocoa butter. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound which is preferably isotonic with the blcod of the recipient. In addition to the aforementicned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may further include one or more accessory ingredient s selected from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including antioxidants and the like.Compounds of formula I and II may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure.For example, 1 One method for preparing compounds of formula I wherein AEMI10.1 comprises cyclisation, as hereinafter described, of a compound of formula IV or aEMI10.2 wherein L is a standard leaving group J.March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd Ed., page 187, New York 1977 such as halide for example chloride or bromide, hydroxide, OR32, imidazoly , sulphoxonium or tosyl and R32 is hydrogen or alkyl, preferably ethyl. Preferred compounds of formula IV are those wherein the leaving group is a halide such as chloride or bromide , hydroxide or tosyloxy, and preferred compounds of formula V are those wherein the leaving group is OR32 as defined.A particularly preferred method comprises cyclisation of a compound of formula IV as hereinbefore defined, especially wherein L is chloride.Cyclisation may be effected at room temperature or with heating for example at a temperature of 155 220 C, optionally in an oxygen free atmosphere for example in nitrogen, optionally in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, tert butanol, xylenes, or toluene, and optionally with a catalyst. The catalyst chosen will depend on the compound of formula III or IV to be cyclised, for example, where the reaction involves elimination of an acid such as hydrochloric, a basic catalyst may be used with or without a solvent such as water or an alcohol such as butanol optionally, but preferably, in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as triethylbenzyl ammonium chloride with or without a solvent such as dichloromethane, diethyl ether, xylenes or toluene, but preferably dichloromethane. Examples of suitable basic catalysts are an alkali metal hydride, hydroxide or alkoxide such as potassium or sodium hydride, potassium or sodium hydroxide, potassium tert butoxide or lithium di isopropylamide, triethylamine, and pyridine.The most preferred method of cyciisation is effected by using aqueous sodium hydroxide in the presence of triethylbenzyl ammonium chloride ac room temperature.Where L is a slow or poor leaving group cyclisation may take place by conversion in situ to a further or better leaving group. For example where L is hydroxide, tosyl chloride may be present in the reaction mixture in order that the tosyloxy group a better leaving group is substituted for the hydroxide group thereby causing cyclisation to proceed faster and more completely.Similarly, compounds of formula IA wherein A isEMI11.1 may be prepared by cyclisation of a corresponding compound of formula IVa or a compound of formula Va ,EMI11.2 wherein R27 to R31, X, Y m and L are hereinbefore defined. 2 One method for preparing compounds of formula III wherein n O, and one or more of R12 R15, is an alkyl group of 1 4 carbon atoms, comprises reaction of a corresponding 1 substituted pyrrolidin 2 one of formula VI , wherein R16R17, R18, R19, R20, X and Y, are as hereinbefore defined, with a base, and an alkyl donor. Examples of suitable bases are alkali metal hydride, hydroxide or alkoxide, such as potassium or sodium hydride, potassium or sodium hydroxide, potassium t butoxide or lithium di isopropylamide. Suitable alkyl donors include alkyl halides. The most preferred method uses lithium di isopropylamide and the appropriate alkyl iodide.EMI12.1 3 One method for preparing compounds of formula III wherein n is O and one of R16, or R18 is O alkenyl or O alkynyl, comprises reaction of the corresponding compounds of formula VII , and VIII EMI13.1 wherein R12, R13 R14 R15, R17 R18, R19, R20, n , X and Y are as defined herein above, provided that in VII R18 is hydrogen and X is carbon and in VIII R16 is H and Y is carbon with a base an d an alkenyl or alkynyl donor. Suitable bases include those defined in 2 above, and alkali metal alkoxides, for example sodium methoxide. Suitable donors include alkenyl halides and alkynyl halides for example allyl bromide, and propargyl bromide. 4 A further method for the preparation of compounds of formula III comprises hydrolysis of compounds of formula IX wherein n, X, Y and R16 toEMI13.2 The hydrolysis may be effected by standard hydrolysing agents known to those skilled in the art, for example, by adding a few drops of water or dilute aqueous acid to the compounds.The compounds of formula IX may themselves be prepared according to the method described by Kwok et al in J.Org. Chem. 1967 32, 738. 5 A further method for the preparation of compounds of formula III wherein n is 0 comprises a displacement reaction between a compound of formula X , and the pyrrolidinone anion formula Xi EMI14.1 wherein L is a standard leaving group such as those hereinbefore defined, M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cation such as Na , and p16 to R20, X and Y are as hereinbefore defined. 6 Another method for the preparation of compounds of formula III comprises reacting compounds of formula XII wherein X, Y and R16 to R20 are as hereinbefore defined with butyrolactone, or 3 methyl butyrolactone. EMI14.2 7 Yet another preparation of compounds of formula III consists of subjecting a compound of formula XIII wherein L, X, Y and R16 to R20 are as hereinbefore defined to ring closure conditions similar to those described in method 1 above. Compounds of formula XIII may be prepared by reacting compounds of formula XII with a compound of formula XIV , wherein L1 andL2 may be the same or different and each is L as defined in method 1 above,EMI14.3 followed by acylation of the nitrogen atom by standard methods. 8 The compound of formula II wherein R12 R13 R14 R15 R18 R19 and R20 are all hydrogen, R16 is hydroxy, Ri7 is allyl, n is 0, and X and Y are both carbon, may also be prepared by Claisen rearrangement of a compound of formula XV EMI15.1 9 A further method for the preparation of compounds of formula III whereinR14 or R15 is C1 4alkyl, comprises reaction of a compound of formula XVI , wherein P is C1 4alkyl, and X, Y and R16 to R are as hereinbefore defined for formula III with a suitable dialkyl sulphoxonium methylide, for example where R14 or R15 is methyl, by reaction with dimethyl sulphoxonium methylide.EMI15.2 10 A yet further method, for the preparation of compounds of formula III comprises reduction of the corresponding oxidised precursor of a compound of formula III , for example, reduction of compounds of formula XVII wherein X,Y, n, and R12 to R20 are all as hereinbefore defined for formula III .EMI15.3 11 A method for the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein A isNH CH2 3C02H comprises base catalysed ring opening of the corresponding pyrrolidinone derivatives of formula VI . Alternatively, compounds of formula I wherein A is NH CH2 3C02H may be prepared by the reaction of compounds of formula XII with a suitable reagent, for example, Br CH2 3C02C2H5 followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate so formed. The compounds of formula IV or V may themseleves be prepared by analogous methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by reacting the compound of formula XII or a salt thereof such as an acid addition salt thereof, for example the hydrochloride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt thereof, for example the lithium salt, with an internal ester, acid halide for example acid chloride, or acid anhydride. For example, the compound of formula XII may be reacted with C1 CH2 3 COC1 to produce a compound of formula IV wherein L is chloride in the presence of triethylamine in dimethoxyethane or dichloromethane, and wherein R16 to R20 are as hereinbefore defined.The reaction may be carried out under the same or similar conditions as described hereinbefore, for cyclisation, since the compound of formula IV or V need not be isolated but may be cyclised in situ, for example, by a method analogous to those described by A.Pernot and A Willemont in MemoiresPresentes a La Soc.

Modified Trysin Hyperalqesic Assay THA This assay quantitatively measures analgesia and is designed to be unaffected by compounds possessing anti inflammatory activity. The procedure described by Vinegar et al. in Eur. J Pharmacol. 37, 23 1976 was used to demonstrate the analgesic activity of the compounds of formula I and of certain known analgesics. The analgesic agents were administered 30 minutes after the administration of trypsin. In addition, a modification of Vinegar s published assay was carried out, comprising the administration of analgesic agent preceding subplantar injectin of trypsin 0.10 ml of 10 solution of trypsin in pyrogen free water by 15 minutes.

The surface temperature was thus maintained at 45 1.00C N 28 measurements of the hot plate temperature under experimental conditions . The time in which a rat placed on the hotplate responded by lifting, shaking or licking either or its hind or forelimbs was recorded in tenths of a second.Only animals responding in pretest within 6 13 seconds were used in the studies.Drugs were suspended in 0.50 a sodium carboxymethylcellulose and administered orally, by gavage, in a volume of 1.00 ml 100 g.b wt. 60 min prior to testing.Animals responded in less than 18.3 seconds were considered unprotected and those which did not respond within 18.3 seconds were considered protected.The reaction time of 18.3 seconds represented the sum of the mean protest times of 40 untreated rats plus the time of 3 standard deviations of the mean.ED50 s and their standard errors were estimated from a graph of the dose response curves using the method of Miller and Tainter Proc.Soc.Exp.Biol.Med. 57, 261 262 1944 . Following this procedure the analgesic activity of the compounds of formula I was compared to that of standard analgesic drugs.Results obtained are given in TABLE 2.
