# Improved vortex generator.

## Abstract
A vortex generator mounted to an aerodynamic surface to generate a relatively strong vortex which is substantially free of unwanted secondary vortices. The vortex generator is in the form of a flat upstanding plate. It has a forward edge portion that slants upwardly and rearwardly from the aerodynamic sur face and then blends into a convexly curved edge portion. The remaining rear edge portion extends generally horizontally to the aerodynamic surface.
