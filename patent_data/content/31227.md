## Description
AN EAll INDENTIFICATION TAGt The present invention relates to an indentifica tion tag for fitting to an ear of an animal. According to the invention there is provided an ear indentification tag comprising a rigid ear piercing.pin having a pointed head end, a shank and a heel end one flexible button secured to the heel of the pin for anchoring the tag at one side of the ear and a second flexible button s ecurable to tulle pointed head end of the pin for anchoring the tag on the other side of the ear. It is envisaged that the pin may be of metal, but it is preferred that the pin be of plastics material having sufficient rigidity that it can pierce an ear without requiring reinforcement against bending by a tag insertion tool. By contrast the to buttons arc preferably of flexible plastics material. It is convenient for the buttons to have sufficient flexibility that they may flex and not jam when snagged by the animal in fending. Whilst either flexible button may be an indentification plate, it is preferred that the second flexible button be the indentification plate. Preferably the indentification plate and tile pin are adapted to cooperate a in preventing the plate from turning on the pin, and b in preventiiig the plate from moving axially on the pin. To ensure correct rotary alignment of the pin and plate prior to fitting they may both be pror ed with means for otarily locating them in a tag insertion tool.A further preferred feature of the indentification plate is provision thereon of means for protecting the head end of tiie pin against being worn away by rubbing by the animal against ricko, for example. Tulle first button and the shin axe secured to prevent the first button from moving axially on the pin. Whilst this securement and the corresponding securement in respect of the second button preferably take the form of grooves around the pin into which the buttons fit, the securements could take the form of overhung recesses in the buttons for accommodating the heel and head of the pin. To help understanding of the invention a specific embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 is an exploded side elevation of the tag of the invention Figure 2 is a view of the indentification plate of Figure 1 taken in the direction of the arrow I inFigure 1 and Figure 3 is a side elevation of the tag when assembled. The tag l shown in the drawing includes a rigid pin 2 of hard nylon plastics material. A head 3, which is pointed for piercing an ear 4, is provided at one end of the pin, whilst a heel 5 in the form of a disc is provided at the other end of the pin. Immediately adjacent the head 3 and the heel 5, grooves 6, 7 are provided in a shank 8 interconnecting the head and the heel. As shown the head 3 and heel 5 nave a larger diameter than the shank 8, though this need not be so.At the underside 9 of the head, a number of equally circumferentially spaced teeth 10 are provided. The pin also has an axial bore 11 and a nick 12 at the heel for correct location of the pin in a tag insertion toolA spigot on the tool engages in bore 11 during insertion to enhance alignment of the pin in comparison with alignment which can be achieved from the comparatively narrow heel. A first or heel button 13, hitch is fitted to the pin prior to insertion of the pin in an ear 4, is shown in Figure 1 adjacent the head 3 of the pin. The heel button is a disc of flexible polyurethane plastics material and has a recess 14 for the heel 5 of the pin and a bore 15 for accommodating the reduced diameter portion of the shank 8 of the pin at the groove 6. The bore 15 is of slightly smaller diameter than the reduced diameter portion, to provide a tight fit of the heel button on the pin in the position shown in Figure 3. A second button or indentification plate 16, also of flexible polyurethane plastics arterial i shown inFigure 1 on the opposite side of the ear from the pin.The plate 16 has a bore 17, similar to bore 15 in the first button in being slightly smaller in diameter than the reduced diameter portion of. the shank at groove 7.On the ear side of the plate 15, a boss 18 is provided around the bore 17. On the other side of the plate a further boss 19 is provided, this boss having a hollows 20 to accommodate the head 3 of the pin. The bottom of the hollow 20 has a number of notches 21 corresponding to the teeth 10. Also provided in the plate is a nick 22, for correct angular location of the plate in the inserticn tool, the nick being opposite the main portion of the plate 17 on which indentification indicia 23 are provided. Figure 3 s.ows the tag assembled and inserted in the ear. The first button is retained by the groove 6 at the heel end of the pin with the heel 5 in the recess 15. This protects the heel from possible abrasion.The shank passes through a hole 24 made by the head 3 in the ear during insertion. The indentification plate is retained against axial movement by engagement of the boss 18 in the groove 7 at the head 3. Due to the angular location provided by the nicks 12, 22 the teeth 10 were already aJigned ith the notches 21 w len the head was thrust through the bore 18 on insertion. Thus the teeth 10 engage in the notches and prevent rotation of the plate on the pin. This is desirable to prevent frictional wear occurring between the indetification plate 16 and the pin 2. Such wear could result in the weakness and ultimately detachment of the indentification plate from the pin. The head 3 is, at least partially, contained in the boss 19 and thereby protected. The two buttons provide an appreciable area for anchoring the tag against pulling through the hole 24, whilst being sufficiently flexible to minimize the risk of jamming when snagged.Should temporary jamming occur, the teeth LO by engagement in the notches 21, help to maintain the shape of the bore 17 in the flexible pate 16. In conscquene there is less chance of the pin pulling out of the bore 17 before the tag becomes unjammed. The invention is not intended to be restricted to the details of the above described tag. For instance, it is possible for the first or heel button to be extended in size and shape to allow for duplication of the identification information or for extra information to be displayed by the tag, e.g. the name and address of the owner of the animal, in addition to the imal s number on the iJentification plate 16. further for different circumstances different sizes and shapes of buttons may be used with a common size and shape of rigid pin.
