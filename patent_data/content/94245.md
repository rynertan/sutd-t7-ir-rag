The compounds of the invention may be prepared by the following methods.Method A Compounds of formula I a EMI14.1 in which R2 and R3 are as defined above may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II EMI14.2 in which R is as defined above with compound of formula III RêCOCH3 III in which Rê is as defined above . The preferred compound of formula III is acetone. This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid which may be a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid, or an organic acid, such as p toluenesulphonic acid or a catalytic amount of iodine. The compound of formula III normally serves as the reaction solvent. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out is not particularly critical and we normally prefer to effect the reaction at a temperature within the range from OOC to 1500C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon the nature of the compounds employed and the reaction temperature, but usually from 1 to 50 hours suffices. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture may be treated by conventional means to recover the desired compound of formulaI a , which may, if necessary, be further purified by such conventional techniques as column chromatography, distillation or recrystallization.Method B Compounds of formula I a may also be prepared by reacting the aforementioned compound of formula II with a compound of formula IV EMI16.1 in which R2 is as defined above . In formula IV , the wavy lines mean, as is conventional, that the hydrogen atom and the carbonyl group attached by them to the doubly bonded carbon atom may either be in the positions shown relative to the other substituents on the double bond or may be in the opposite positions, i.e. they may be cis or trans and the particular positions in which these substituents are drawn in the formula have no steric significance. The preferred compound of formula IV is mesityl oxide. This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acidic catalyst, which may be a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid, or an organic acid, such as g toluenesulphonic acid. The reaction may be carried out without any solvent or in the presence of a suitable solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or chloroform . The reaction temperature is not particularly critical, but we normally prefer to use a temperature within the range from OOC to 1500C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 2 to 60 hours will usually suffice. When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture may be treated by conventional means to recover the desired compound of formula I a which may, if necessary, be further purified by such conventional techniques as column chromatography, recrystallization or distillation.Method C Compounds of formula I a may also be prepared by reacting the aforementioned compound of formula II with a compound of formula V EMI17.1 in which R2 is as defined above . The preferred compound of formula V is diacetone alcohol. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acidic catalyst, which may be a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or an organic acid such as toluenesulphonic acid . The reaction may be carried out without any solvent or in the presence of a suitable solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction.Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane or heptane ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform acetonitrile or dimethylform amide The reaction temperature is not particularly critical and we normally prefer to carry out the reaction at a temperature within the range from OOC to 1500C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon the reagents used and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 2 to 60 hours will usually suffice. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture may be treated by conventional means to recover the desired compound of formula I a which may then be further purified by conventional techniques, such as column chromatography, distillation or recrystallization, if desired.Method D Compounds of formula I b EMI19.1 in which R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I a , which have may been prepared by any of Methods A, B andC, with a compound of formula VI R4X VI wherein R4 is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom or an acyloxy group, provided that X only represents an acyloxy group when R4 represents an acyl group . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or t butanol acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. The reaction is preferably also effected in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include alkali metal hydrides, such as lithium hydride or sodium hydride alkyllithium compounds, such as butyllithium or sec butyllithium alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium t butoxide tertiary amines, such as triethylamine or tributylamine and heterocyclic bases, such as pyridine or picoline. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out is not particularly critical, but we prefer to employ a temperature within the range from 100C to 1500C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 1 to 20 hours will usually suffice. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture may be treated by conventional means to recover the desired compound of formula I b , which may then, if necessary, be further purified by such conventional techniques as column chromatography, recrystallization or distillation. Depending upon the particular reaction conditions, the compounds of formulae I a and I b prepared byMethods A D may be obtained in the form of the free base or as an acid addition salt. Conversion of the resulting free base to the corresponding salt or conversion of the salt to the free base may be effected by conventional means. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid or nitric acid and salts with organic acids such as tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid or maleic acid . Of these, the hydrochlorides are generally preferred. The compounds of the invention have been tested for pharmacological activity and found to exhibit anti inflammatory, analgesic and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activities. Details of certain of the pharmacological tests are as follows Carrageenin oedema test for anti inflammatory activity Male Wistar rats weighing 120 150 g were fasted overnight and then received a test compound per os as an aqueous tragacanth suspension. 30 minutes later, inflammation was induced by the subcutaneous injection of 0.05 ml of a 1 carrageenin suspension into the plantar tissue of a hind paw of each rat Winter et al.,Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.Med., 111, 544 1962 3. The anti oedema activity was measured volumetrically, by assessing the response, as calculated from the following equation Response V VO VO where VO and V represent, respectively, the paw volume immediately before and 3 hours after the carrageenin injection. The test compounds were administered at a dose of 100 mg kg and the results are reported in thQ following Table as the inhibitory rate, that is the percentage inhibition of the pain response.Pain test for analgesic activity This test was conducted according to a modification of the method reported by L.O. Randall and J.J. Selitto in Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 11, 409 1959 , proposed byWinter and Flatake 1957 . Yale Wistar rats of 4 weeks of age and weighing 60 90 g were injected with 0.1 ml of a 20 by weight suspension of Brewers yeast in the right hind paw. 4 hours later, rats which had a pain threshold to pressure induced pain less than 10 x 30g were selected. Each of these was given orally a test compound as an aqueous tragacanth suspension at a dose of 50 mg kg.and 2 hours after administration of the test compound, the pain threshold was determined by observing pain responses such as struggling or squeaking when the inflamed or normal paw was subjected to pressure by a machine Ugo Basile . An effective animal was defined, in accordance with Blane s method 1968 , as an animal which showed at least twice the mean pain threshold of control animals. The results are reported as the number of effective animals as a proportion of the total number of animals in each group. The results are reported in the following Table 1, in which the compounds of the invention are identified by the numbers heretofore assigned to them.
