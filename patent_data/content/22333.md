# Application of liquids to textiles.

## Abstract
The application of liquid to a moving fabric is effected by delivering same to a rotatable spinning disc which centrifugally impells the liquid against the fabric. This action overcomes surface tension causing the liquid droplets to break up into a fine mist so that a large area of fabric is wetted with an amount of liquid which is substantially less than the fabric weight. Also, the velocity imparted to the liquid droplets in mist forms enhances absorption of the liquid by the fabric.
