# Apparatus for slit radiography.

## Abstract
An apparatus for slit radiography which comprises an X ray source and a slit diaphragm through which a body to be examined can be scanned by a planar X ray fan beam. The slit diaphragm is operatively associated with a plurality of juxaposed tongue shaped attenuation elements, which elements are arranged for having their free ends swung to a greater or lesser extent into the X ray beam so as to effect a local attenuation of the beam. The tongue shaped attenua tion elements form at least one flared configuration as seen from the X ray source.
