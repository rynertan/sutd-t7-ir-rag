## Description
METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF NITRODIPHENYL ETHERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for preparing trifluoromethyl nitrodiphenyl ethers having the formulaEMI1.1 vein m is an integer of 1 to3, n is 1 or 2 and R is hydrogen, carboy1, carboxylate, formyl, keto, oxime, cyano, alkyl, alkoxy, chloro, bromo, or N, N dialkylamino. The trifluoromethylphenyl nitro phenylethers that may be prepared by the process of this invention are members of a class of compounds useful as herbicides and or as intermediates for the preparation of various herbicides, pesticides, dyestuffs, and pharmaceuticals.In recent years, the development of commercial utility for trifluoromethylphenyl nitrophenylethers in the agricultural and pharmaceutical fields has led to considerable activity in the investigation of methods of preparation. The following U.S. Patents disclose the preparation and or use of various trifluoromethylphenyl nitrophenylethers 4,262,152 4,031,131 4,259,510 3,941,830 3,798,276 3,928,416 3,784,635 4,063,929 4,087,272 4,263,277 4,263,041 4,002,662 4,001,005 and 3,979,437. Various methods for the preparation of 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 41 nitrodiphenyl ethers are known. One method, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,259,510 comprises reacting a 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenolate with a p nitro halobenzene.However, the phenol ate reactant is not readily available commercially and, as a result, this synthesis route involves a preliminary step to prepare the phenolate. In another method, suggested in U.S. Patent 4,031,131, a 3 chloro 4 halobenzotrifluoride is reacted with a phenoxide and the resultant diphenyl ether is subsequently nitrated. In addition to requiring an additional step, the subsequent nitration is inefficient and results in the production of undesired isomers. To avoid the disadvantage of a subsequent nitration step, the 3 chloro 4halobenzotrifluoride may be reacted with a p nitrophenoxide.However, it has been found that the presence of the nitro group drastically reduces the nucleophilicity of the phenoxide oxygen that is the reactive site, so that reaction with compounds such as 3,4 dichlorobenzotrifluoride are found to be extremely inefficient. Nevertheless, it has now been found that, despite the adverse effect of the nitro group on the nucleophilicity of the phenoxide oxygen when the chlorohalobenzotrifluoride reactant is a chloro fluorobenzotrifluoride such as 3 chloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride, the reaction with nitrophenoxides, especially p nitrophenoxides can be easily effected, since the reaction of the phenoxide oxygen at the fluorine site proceeds smoothly even without a catalyst to provide the trifluoromethylphenyl nitrophenylether product in high yield. In this matter, the need for a subsequent nitration step is eliminated.Furthermore, the method of this invention, utilizing chloro fluorobenzotrifluoride reactants is particularly suitable for reactions with nitrophenoxides carrying highly sensitive functional groups, such as aldehydes which might otherwise be further oxidized in a subsequent nitration step such as required by the prior art process described above. Chloro fluorobenzotrifluorides may be prepared by the vapor phase chloro denitration reaction of the corresponding chloro nitrobenzotrifluoride with a chlorinating agent. Thus, for example, 3 chloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride may be prepared by vapor phase chloro denitration reaction of chlorine with 4 fluoro 3 nitrobenzotrifluoride. The chloro denitration process is carried out under conditions of temperature and pressure appropriate for a vapor phase reaction, the exact conditions being dependent on the properties of the particular reactants employed. Typically, the process is carried out at atmospheric conditions and at a temperature in the range of about 250 to about 4500 Celsius, preferably 3000 to 4000C.Typical of the chloro substituted benzotrifluorides that may be prepared in this manner and employed as reactants in the process of the present invention are 3 chloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride 4 chloro 3 fluorobenzotrifluoride 2 chloro 5 fluorobenzotrifluoride 5 chloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride 2 chloro4 fluorobenzotrifluoride 4 chloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride 3 chloro 5 fluorobenzotrifluoride 2,5 dichloro 4 fluorobenzo tri fluoride 4,5 dichloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride 3,5 di chl oro 4 fl uorobenzotrifluoride 3,4 difluoro 5 chlorobenzotrifluoride 2,5 difluoro 3 chlorobenzotrifluoride 3,5 difluoro4 chlorobenzotrifluoride and the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, trifluoromethylphenylnitrophenyl ethers of the formulaEMI4.1 Wherein m is an integer of 1 to 3, n is 1 or 2 and R is hydrogen formyI keto of the formula COR wherein R is alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms oxime of the formula CR NOR where R11 and R are independently hydrogen or alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms cyano alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms alkoxy of 1 to 6 carbon atoms chloro bromo N,Ndialkylamino, the alkyl groups being preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carboxyl, carboxylate salts or carboxylate esters of the formula C02R2wherein R2 is alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms are prepared by reacting a chloro fluoro benzotrifluoride of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein m and n are defined above and m plus n is equal to or less than 4, with a nitro phenoxide of the formulaEMI5.1 there R is defined above, and M is a cation of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, with the proviso that then m is 1, R is keto or axi. If M is a divalent alkaline earth metal cation, the above formula will contain two nitrophenoxide pieties per metal cation. Typical chloro fluorobenzotrifluoride reactants that may be employed in the process of this invention are 2 chloro 5 fl uorobenzotri fluoride 5 chloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride 2 chl oro 4 fl uorobenzotri fluoride 4 chloro 2 fluorobenzotrifluoride 3 chloro 5 fluorobenzotrifluoride 3 chl oro 4 fl uoro benzotrifluoride 4 chl oro 3 fl uorobenzotrifl uori de 2,5 dichloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride 4 ,5 di chl oro 2 fluorobenzotri fluoride 3,5 dichloro 4 fluorobenzotrifluoride 3,4 difluoro5 chlorobenzotrifluoride 2,5 difluoro 3 chlorobenzotrifluoride 3,5 difluoro 4 chlorobenzotrifluoride, and the like. The nitrophenoxide may be employed as shown as a previously prepared reactant or may be prepared in situ in the reaction mixture from the corresponding nitrophenol and an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate or, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate. The preferred nitrophenoxides are the sodium or potassium salts. When a nitrophenol bearing a carboxylic group is employed as a reactant it is preferred to employ the di salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. Typical nitrophenoxide reactants that may be employed in the process of this invention include for example, potassium4 nitrophenoxide dipotassium 5 hydroxy 2 nitrobenzoic acid sodium 3 chloro 4 nitrophenoxide sodium 3 methyl 4 nitrophenoxide sodium 5 hydroxy 2 nitrobenzaldehyde potassium 3chloro 4 nitrophenoxide sodium 3 bromo 4 nitrophenoxide potassium 3 ethyl 4 nitrophenoxide and the like. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a do polar aprotic solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone,N, N dimethylformamide, and the like. The reaction may be run neat utilizing the chloro fluorobenzotrifluoride reactant as the liquid reaction medium in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, such as a quaternary ammonium salt, a quaternary phosphonium halide or a crown ether catalyst. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out may vary considerably but is preferably maintained in the range of about 50 to about 300 Celsius, and most preferably, in the range of about 100 to about 200 Celsius. The process is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure. However, autogenous pressure may be employed if desired, to allow the use of higher temperatures.
