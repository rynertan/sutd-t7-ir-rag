# HOT MELT PRESSSURE SENSITIVE THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERIC ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
This invention relates to novel hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive compositions. More particularly, it relates to hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive compositions comprising blends of thermoplastic elastomeric polymers made from ethylene and propylene tackifiers and optionally other additives such as plasticizers, fillers, and stabilizers.
