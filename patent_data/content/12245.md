# Process for producing chlorine and caustic soda.

## Abstract
A process for producing chlorine and caustic soda is described involving a bank of electrolytic membrane cells ar ranged for series catholyte flow. Power efficiency is improved by maintaining at least two of the initial cells in the bank in parallel catholyte flow, combining the catholyte streams from such initial cells and introducing the combined catholyte into the cathode compartment of one or more succeeding cells in the bank.
