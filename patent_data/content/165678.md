# V Belt structure.

## Abstract
A push type metal V belt is formed from a single strip of sheet metal. The strip 10 is formed and folded such that the lateral faces 20 between the converging outer drive edges 18 are tapered to have a reduced thickness at the inner fold 16 . The formed strip also has lateral slots 22,24 in which, after folding, continuous metal bands 30 are disposed for maintaining the belt in a continuous loop configuration.
