# Safety valve.

## Abstract
A safety valve in combination with a resilient tube for preventing the free flow of fluid through the resilient tube comprises a valve body 28 which is connected to a valve head 14 of generally circular cross section which is formed with a flat peripherial land 16 . The resilient tube 12 is disposed over the valve head 14 for snug fluid sealing engagement between the inner surface of the tube and the flat land on the valve head. Also, the resilient tube is fluid sealed to the valve body for fluid communication therebe tween. Stretching the resilient tube separates a portion of the inner surface of the tube from the flat land on the valve head to permit fluid flow past the valve head. When the resilient tube is unstretched, the engagement between the inner surface of the tube and the flat land of the valve head prevents free fluid flow.
