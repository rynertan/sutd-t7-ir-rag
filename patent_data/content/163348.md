# Improvements in quartz infra red lamps.

## Abstract
An infra red lamp consists of a quartz tubular envelope 1 filled with a halogen gas and sealed at each end with a respective pinch seal 2 . A coiled coil tungsten filament 8 is supported within the envelope 1 and is electrically con nected, via a molydenum foil strip 4 and lead wires 6 within the pinch seal 2 , to a connector 5 for connection to a power supply. The coiled coil filament 8 is supported by a number of tungsten wire spirals 9 spaced along the length of the filament 8 , each spiral 9 being intermeshed with the filament 8 .
