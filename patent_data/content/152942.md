## Description
The present invention relates to a device for detecting an air fuel ratio of an air fuel mixture over a wide range from below the stoichiometric ratio rich for the mixture to above the stoichiometric ratio lean for the mixture by exposing a probe or a sensing element to exhaust gases resulting from combustion of the mixture. In automobiles, it is necessary to detect an air fuel ratio of a mixture supplied to an internal combustion engine for controlling the supply of fuel to the engine so as to adjust the actual air fuel ratio to a target value. Common practice to detect the air fuel ratio is to expose an oxygen sensing element, viz., an oxygen sensor, to exhaust gases discharged by the internal combustion engine and measure oxygen partial pressure in the exhaust gases. JP A 57 76450 discloses a device for detecting an air fuel ratio of an air fuel mixture having an air fuel ratio above the stoichiometric ratio for the mixture by measuring an oxygen partial pressure in exhaust gases resulting from the combustion of the mixture by exposing an oxygen sensing element to the exhaust gases. This known device is further described referring to Fig. 1. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the oxygen sensing element comprises an oxygen ion conductive solid eletrolyte 1 having a measurement electrode layer 2 on one side thereof and a reference electrode layer 3 on the other side thereof. A DC voltage is applied between the electrode layers 2 and 3 to cause an electric current I where R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and F the Faraday constant. This electromotive force E may be measured and taken out in terms of an output Vs of the sensing element. The output Vs exibits different voltage versus λ characteristics for different magnitudes of the electric current I This known device, however, is not suitable for detecting an air fuel ratio of a rich mixture λ 1 because, as will be understood from Fig. 3, the current I As a result, with the same measured magnitude in the electric current I A device for detecting an air fuel ratio of a fuel mixture as indicated in the precharacterizing part of claim 1 as disclosed in FR A 2 334 101 only uses a reference electrode as the first electrode and a sensor electrode as the second electrode which are connected to the source of DC electric current in order to provide a current flow between these electrodes through the oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte. This current causes migration of oxygen ions in order to provide an oxygen partial pressure. The intensity of the current is measured by an amperemeter in order to provide an output signal representative of the oxygen content within a gas mixture. FR A 2 449 887 discloses an oxygen sensing element comprising a plurality of plates to be arranged one over the other and including an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte, first and second electrode layers, electrical heating elements, insulating and porous layers. EP A 0011 530 discloses an oxygen sensing element for detecting an air fuel ratio of a fuel mixture comprising a solid electrolyte having on both opposite sides first and second electrodes operating as sensing and reference electrodes, respectively. The sensing electrode is exposed to the gas receiving portion which is connected via a porous means for restricting gas diffusion of the exhaust gases to the gas receiving portion. US A 4 264 425 discloses a device having an oxygen sensing element for detecting the air fuel ratio of an air fuel mixture. The element is a combination of two oxygen concentration cells, each having a solid electrolyte, a porous sensing electrode and a reference electrode. The device includes a DC power supply for forcing a current to flow through the solid electrolyte of each cell thereby causing oxygen ions to migrate through each solid electrolyte. The current flows from reference electrode to the sensing electrode in one cell and reversibly in the other cell. Air fuel ratios above a stochiometric ratio inclusive and below the stochiometric ratio inclusive can be detected. It is the object of the present invention to provide a device for detecting an air fuel ratio which has a sufficiently long endurability such that it can sustain stable output characteristic for a long time even if it is used to probe exhaust gases resulting from combustion of a fuel rich mixture. The above mentioned object is solved by the features as claimed in the characterizing part of claim 1. By means of the third electrode means acting as a pump electrode decomposition of the ion conductive solid electrolyte is prevented or at least minimized since the voltage across the second electrode means acting as the sensor electrode and the first electrode means acting as the reference electrode is kept at a predetermined constant voltage. If a sensor electrode simultaneously serves as pump electrode a voltage which can be measured involves a voltage due to oxygen partial pressure as well as a voltage drop due to the internal resistance of the sensor element. With the inventive device the air fuel ratio of the mixture fed to the internal combustion engine can be singularly and accurately detected over a wide range by supplying the pump current the forward and reverse directions of the current are available to the solid electrolyte so as to keep the oxygen partial pressure ratio across the solid electrolyte constant and then measuring the pump current. Further developments of the invention are claimed in the subclaims. Referring to Figs. 4 to 12 of the accompanying drawings, the present invention is further described. Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, a first embodiment of a sensing element oxygen sensor of a device for detecting an air fuel ratio of a fuel mixture is illustrated. The sensing element comprises a partition 14 having a first side 14a and a second side 14b. The partition 14 defines on the first side 14a an atmospheric air receiving portion 13 communicating with the ambient atmosphere and on the second side 14b a gas receiving portion 19 communicating with a source of exhaust gases, such as an exhaust pipe of an automotive internal combustion engine, as best seen in Fig. 5. In this embodiment, the partition 14 is formed of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte. If desired, the partition 14 may be partly formed of the oxygen ion conductive solid eletrolyte such that that portion of the partition which is interposed between first electrode means 15 and second electrode means 16, 17 is formed of the oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte and the balance portion formed of another heat resistive material. The first electrode means includes a thin electrode layer 15 printed on the first side 14a of the partition 14 and exposed to the atmospheric air receiving portion 13, while the second electrode means includes a thin pump electrode layer 16 and a thin sensor electrode layer 17 which are arranged side by side. Referring to Fig. 4, there is shown a base plate 10 with an electrical heater 11 for heating the partition 14 of the oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte. Lying on the base plate 10 is an atmospheric air receiving plate 12 formed with a channel like gutter 12a closed at one end. Lying on the atmospheric air receiving plate 12 is the partition 14 having printed on the first side thereof 14a the reference electrode layer 15 and on the opposite second side thereof 14b the pump and sensor electrode layers 16 and 17. The heater 11 has leads 22 and 23, and the electrode layers 15, 16 and 17 has leads 24, 25 and 26 connected as shown in Fig. 6. For restricting gas diffusion of the exhaust gases to the second electrode means 16 and 17, a plate 18 is laid on the second side 14b of the partition or solid electrolyte 14, which plate 18 is formed with a window like opening 18a defining the side boundary of the gas receiving portion 19, and another plate 20 is laid on the plate 18, which plate 20 is formed with a small hole 21 for resticting gas flow communication between the gas receiving portion 19 and the ambient exhaust gas environment. The base plate 10, atmospheric air receiving plate 12 and plates 18, 20 are formed of a heat resistive insulator, such as alumina and mullite or a heat resistive alloy. The solid electrolyte 14 is formed of a sintered body obtained by solidifying at least one selected from C₂O, MgO, Y₂O₂, YB₂O₃ into an oxide such as ZrO₂, HrO₂, ThO₂, Bi₂O₃. Each of the electrodes 15, 16 and 17 includes platinum or gold as a main constituent thereof. The pump electrode 16 and the reference electrode 15 serve as electrodes which allows electric current to pass through the solid electrolyte 14 to cause the migration of oxygen ion within the solid electrolyte 14 so as to keep an oxygen partial pressure ratio, viz., a ratio between oxygen partial pressure at one side of the solid electrolyte and exygen partial pressure at the other side thereof, constant. The sensor electrode 17 and the reference electrode 15 serve as electrodes for measuring an electric voltage developed across the solid electrolyte 14 due to the oxygen partial pressure ratio. Referring to Fig. 6, the electrode layers 15, 16 and 17 are circuited with a detecting circuit 30. The circuit 30 comprises a source of electric voltage 31 which generates a target electric voltage Va, a differential amplifier 32, a pump electric current supply unit 33, a resistor 34 and a pump electric current detecting unit 35 which detects the pump electric current by measuring the electric voltage across the resistor 34. The differential amplifier 32 functions to compare a potential Vs of the reference electrode 15 of the sensing element relative to the sensor electrode 17 with the target electric voltage Vs, and calculate the difference therebetween ΔV The pump electric current detecting unit 35 detects the pump electric current Ip by measuring a difference in electric potential across the resistor 34 in terms of the electric voltage Vi Vi Ip . The direction of flow of the pump electric current Ip as indicated by the fully drawn arrow in Fig. 6 is regarded as the positive direction and in this case the electric voltage Vi detected becomes positive, whereas when the direction of the pump electric current is negative as indicated by a broken arrow, the electric voltage Vi becomes negative. The operation of this embodiment is described. Although any value is set as the target electric voltage Va generated by the source of electric voltage 31 as long as it corresponds to a value which may be taken by the electric voltage Vs generated at the sensor electrode 17, it is preferrable for the purpose of accurately converging the electric voltage Vs to the target value that the target electric voltage should take a value at which a tangent in variation in the electric voltage Vs versus variation in oxygen concentration within the gas receiving portion 19 is the largest, that is, a middle value between the upper and lower limits between which the electric voltage rapidly changes versus variation in the oxygen concentration. If 500 mV is set as the target value Vs, the pump electric current supply unit or circuit 33 controls the supply of the pump electric current Ip in such a manner as to accomplish the relationship Vs 500 mV. Assuming that the termperature T is 1000 K, the oxygen partial pressures Pa and Pg within the atmospheric air receiving portion 13 of the sensing element and the gas receiving portion 19 thereof shall satisfy the following relationship which has been obtained by using the Nernst s equation Assuming the oxygen partial pressure within the exhaust gases is Px, the quantity Q of oxygen O₂ entering the gas receiving portion 19 past the small hole 21 can be expressed as Q D Px Pg , where D is the diffusion coefficient. Since Pg 0, Since the quantity of oxygen ion O² migrating within the solid electrolyte 14 is as high as this quantity Q, the following relation Ip Q holds. The pump electric current Ip therefore varies in proportion to the oxygen partial pressure oxygen concentration within the exhaust gases as shown in Fig. 7. Since the oxygen concentration is closely related to the air fuel ratio when the air fuel ratio A F of the mixture fed to the internal combustion engine is on the lean side λ 1 , it is apparent that the air fuel ratio can be accurately detected with this circuit. Since the oxygen partial pressure Px within the exhaust gases ranges from 10 ²⁰ to 10 ²⁵ equilibrium oxygen partial pressure . When the air fuel ratio is on the rich side λ 1 , the relationship Ip 0 should result from calculation using the equation 2 . However, when the air fuel ratio is on the rich side, the exhaust gases contain much activate gases, HC and CO, for example. Taking CO as an example, the migration of oxygen ion in the opposite direction from the atmospheric air receiving portion 13 side to the gas receiving portion 19 side is needed so as to establish the relationship Pg 10 ¹⁰ 0.206 provided Px is between 10 ²⁰ and 10 ²⁵. However, the oxygen O₂ having migrated to the surface of the pump electrode 16 of the gas receiving portion 19 is consumed by the reaction as expressed by an equation as follows, Thus, when the air fuel ratio is on the rich side, the rate of consumption of the oxygen O₂ by the reaction expressed by the equation 3 is measured in terms of the pump electric current Ip. In other words, what is measured is the rate of the reaction expressed by the above equation 3 . The rate of reaction expressed by the equation 3 is proportional to the amount of CO flowing into the gas receiving portion 19 past the small hole 21. Since the CO partial pressure within the gas receiving portion 19 is almost zero due to the consumption by the reaction expressed by the equation 3 , the amount Qco of CO flowing into the gas receiving portion 19 past the small hole 21 is expressed by, Therefore, the amount of O₂ migrated by pumping from the atmospheric air receiving portion 13 by means of the pump electric current Ip is proportional to the amount of O₂ neccesary to keep the oxygen partial pressure Pg within the gas receiving portion 19 at the value 0.206 10 ¹⁰. In other words, the pump current Ip is proportional to the concentration of CO within the exhaust gases. When the air fuel ratio is on the rich side, the concentration of CO or CO HC is closely related to the air fuel ratio, the air fuel ratio can be accurately and continuously detected by measuring the pump current Ip even if the air fuel ratio is on the rich side. Thus, the electric voltage Vi that is proportional to the pump current Ip detected by the air fuel detecting circuit 30 shown in Fig. 6 varies singularly and continuously with the variation in air fuel ratio from the rich side to the lean side over the wide range as shown in Fig. 8. In the case of the sensing element shown in Figs. 4 and 5, since that side of the solid electrolyte 14 on which the reference electrode 15 lies is disposed within the atmospheric air receiving portion 13 and the opposite side of the solid electrolyte 14 where the pump and sensor electrodes 16 and 17 lie is disposed within the gas receiving portion 19 that communicates with the gas to be measured via the small hole 21, none of the electrodes 15 to 17 are exposed directly to the exhaust gases, thus reducing the rate at which the electrodes are deteriorated. Since even when the air fuel ratio is on the rich side and thus there is little oxygen left in the exhaust gases the oxygen partial pressure ratio across the solid electrolyte 14 is kept constant owing to the above mentioned migration of oxygen ion from the atmospheric air receiving portion 13 to the gas receiving portion 19, the decomposition of the material ZrO₂ of the solid eletrolyte 14 into ions does not occur, thus enhancing the endurability of the sensing element. Referring to Fig. 9, the detecting circuit 30 is further described where the same reference numerals as used in Fig. 6 are used to designate counterparts. The reference character A₁ designates an operation amplifier, A₂ a differential amplifier, A₃ and A₄ buffer amplifiers, respectively. The pump current supply unit 33 regulates the amount and the direction of the pump current Ip such that the difference indicative signal ΔV generated by the differential amplifier is fed to an inverter amplifier 36 including the operational amplifier A₁, and a complementary phase inverter circuit including transistors Q₁, Q₂ and diodes D₁, D₂ regulates the amount and the direction of the pump current Ip in response to the output of the inverter amplifier 36 so as to decrease ΔV to zero. The pump electric current detecting unit 35 includes the differential amplifier A₂ which detects the difference in potential across the resistor 34 and thus detects Ip in terms of electric voltage Vi and generates the output of the differential amplifier A₂ via the buffer amplifier A₃. Next, a second embodiment of a sensing element according to the present invention is described referring to Figs. 10 and 11 which respectively show an exploded perspective view thereof and a longitudinal cross sectional view through the electrode mounting portion thereof. This embodiment features that a clearance defined between two plates serves not only as a gas receiving portion but also as means for restricting diffusion of gas. Referring to the structure of this embodiment, similarly to the first embodiment, there is a base plate 40 with a heater 41 and lying on the base plate is an atmospheric air receiving plate 42 formed with a channel like gutter 42a defining an atmospheric air receiving portion 43. Lying on the atmospheric air receiving plate 42 is a partition of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte 44. Similarlity with the first embodiment exists till forming a rectangular thin electrode layer 45 on the solid eletrolyte 44. However, there is a difference that a pump electrode layer 46 and a sensor electrode layer 47 which are to be arranged in opposed relationship with the reference electrode layer 45 are formed such that the pump electrode layer 46 is of rectangular and has the sensor electrode layer 47 disposed in the center rectangular opening formed through the center portion thereof in such a manner as to surround the outer periphery of the latter. A plate 50 is connected to the solid electrolyte with a spacer 48 interposed therebetween the spacer may be replaced with an adheasive layer , leaving a distance 0.1 mm, for example , creating a clearance 49 between the electrode arranged portion of the solid electrolyte 44 and the plate 50, causing this clearance 49 to serve as means for restricting diffusion of gas. Designated by 52, 53 in Fig. 10 are leads for the heater 41, designated by 54 to 56 are leads for the reference electrode 45, pump electrode 46 and sensor electrode 47, respectively The materials of the component parts of this embodiment are similar to the first embodiment. Similarly to the first embodiment, the air fuel ratio of the mixture fed to the internal combustion engine can be continuously and accurately detected over the wide range from the rich side to the lean side by means of a detecting circuit similar to that shown in Fig. 6, and besides the endurability is enhanced similarly to the first embodiment. Since the diffusion of gas is restricted by the clearance which is open to the environment filled with gas to be measured at a plurality of sides thereof three sides in this example , there occurs little infuence on the diffusion restricting performance owing to the deposit of the components of the exhaust gases, thus ensuring stable operation over a prolonged time. The distance and shape formed by the clearance may be easily varied as desired by varying the thickness of the spacer 48, thus making the design change and quality control easy. Fig. 12, which is a similar view to Fig. 5, illustrates a third embodiment resulting from a slight modification of the first embodiment according to the present invention. In Fig. 12, the same reference numerals as used in Fig. 5 are used to designate counterparts, and their description is omitted. The third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that a gas receiving portion 19 is covered by a porous sintered body 60 and this sintered body 60 is used to serve as means for restricting diffusion of gas. Similar effects as in the case of the first embodiment are provided with this third embodiment. It is more practical for ease in manufacturing to fill the space serving as the gas receiving portion 19 with the porous material because the porous material ensures the inflow of gas. Although, in each of the above described embodiments, the common reference electrode is placed on the partition of the solid electrolyte at its atmospheric air receiving side surface and the pump electrode and sensor electrode are separately placed on the partition at its gas receiving side surface, this relationship may be reversed. Alternatively, the reference electrodes may be separately provided for the pump and sensor electrodes, respectively. If the pump electrode and the sensor electrode are formed as a common electrode so that this common electrode serves as an electrode for supplying the pump current and also as an electrode for measuring an electric voltage generated due to the oxygen partial pressures, an electric voltage measured between the electrodes includes not only an electric voltage due to oxygen partial pressures but also a drop in electric voltage due to the internal resistance within the sensing element so that a compensation for this internal resistance is necessary in order for accurate setting of the target value which greatly affects the accuracy in keeping the oxygen partial pressure ratio across the solid electrolyte constant. For the compensation, as taught JP A 57 192850, an AC current is superimposed on the inflowing current between the electrodes of the sensing element, and a DC current portion of the signal measured across the resistor 34 shown in Fig. 6 is used as the detected signal Ip and an AC current portion of the signal is used to calculate the internal resistance. The AC current portion is multiplied with the signal Ip detected by measuring the DC current portion to provide a voltage drop and a value including this voltage drop is set as the target electric voltage value. With this target value, the air fuel ratio can be accurately detected over the wide range similarly to the preceding embodiments. As will now be understood from the preceding description, the air fuel ratio of the mixture fed to the internal combustion engine can be singularly and accurately detected over the wide range by the use of the sensing element according to the present invention by supplying the pump current the forward and reverse directions of the current available to the solid electrolye so as to keep the oxygen partial pressure ratio across the solid electrolyte constant and then measuring the pump current. Besides, with the sensing element according to the present invention, the deterioration of the electrodes is extremely reduced, the output characteristic is stable and sufficiently long endurability is provided because the solid electrolyte and the electrodes thereon are not directly exposed to the exhaust gases and the decomposition of the solid electrolyte into ions does not occur even when the sensing element is used to probe the exhaust gases resulting from combustion of a fuel rich mixture.
