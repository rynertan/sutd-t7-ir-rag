## Description
EXTRUSION LAMINATED PRODUCT The present invention relates to an intrusion laminated product having at least three thermoplastic resin layers. Polyvinylidene fluoride hereinafter referred to as PVDF for brevity is a resin having excellent weathering resistance and chemical resistance. However,PVDF has disadvantages, such as that 1 the production cost is very high since it is a fluorine type resin and 2 immediately after extrusion from an extruder crystal lization readily occurs due to its high crystallizability, resulting in formation of spherulites, and thereforePVDF sheets not orientated by stretching have poor transparency. In order to utilize the excellent properties of PVDF, it has been proposed to laminate a film of PVDF on other transparent commercially available resins.There are various methods of producing such laminated products. Of such methods, the simplest method is a method comprising coextruding the resins to provide a laminated product, and this method permits one step production of laminated products. Such coextrusion to produce laminated films, for example, including a PVDF film is known as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,647,612, and PVDF can be laminated on, for example, polymethyl methacrylate P or polyvinyl chloride PVC by coextrusion. It is described, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,253,060, thatPVDF and PMMA have particularly high compatibility with each other and can be uniformly mixed. In addition, it is described in British Patent 1,049,088 that other acrylic ester type resins having structures similar to that of PMMA are compatible with PVDF. Therefore, the interface between the PVDF and acrylic ester type resins is well bonded, and in laminating a PVDF layer on other resin layers, it is preferred to interpose therebetween an acrylic acid type resin as an intermediate layer. An attempt has been made to produce sheets having good transparency by coextrusion and lamination of PVDF and other transparent thermoplastic resins using an acrylic ester type resin layer comprising ethyl methacrylate or methyl methacrylate as a main structural monomer as an intermediate layer. In this case, it is important to minimize formation of spherulites formed in the PVDF layer so as not to deteriorate the transparency.It is known that formation of spherulites is typically observed when molten resins are solidified at the temper ature near the crystallization temperature thereof. In order to prevent such solidification at a temperature near the crystallization temperature, therefore, it is preferred that resins extruded from an extruder are rapidly cooled to temperatures much lower than the crystallization temperature. Thus, laminated products obtained by coextrusion are rapidly cooled from the surface side of PVDF where spherulites are most readily formed. However, when fluid like resins extruded from an extruder are taken off, for example, through the surface of a cooling roll, vibration of fluid like resins inevitably occurs, at least to some extent. Therefore, if the cooling roll is maintained at low temperatures such that solidification occurs just when the resin comes into contact with the cooling roll, the taken off sheet lacks flatness. Thus, the solidification time is preferably set so that the resin is cooled after it comes into close contact with the cooling roll. For this purpose, in the case of PVDF, the cooling roll is usually maintained at temperatures ranging from 60 C to 125 C. However, since the cooling temperature at taking off of the PVDF layer is limited, the formation of spherulites in the PVDF layer to a certain extent inevitably occurs.Furthermore, as the thickness of the PVDF layer increases, the cooling rate of PVDF in the interior of the layer reduces,resulting in the formation of large sized spherulites. Transparency is markedly reduced by the combination of an increase of thickness and the formation of large sized spherulites.Therefore, in producing transparent laminated products having a PVDF layer as a surface layer, it is preferred to reduce the thickness of the PVDF layer as much as is practically possible. It is also known that in laminating a sheet having good weathering properties made of PVDF, polyvinyl fluoride CPVF or the like, on a sheet having poor weathering properties, ultraviolet absorbers hereinafter referred to as UVA for brevity can be incorporated into the sheet of PVDF, PVF or the like to protect the underlying sheet having poor weathering properties from deterioration by ultraviolet rays. In the case of laminated sheets having a PVDF surface layer, it is considered to prevent the deterioration of underlying substrate sheets due to ultraviolet rays by incorporatingUVA into the PVDF surface layer. However, the amount ofUVA which can be uniformly mixed with PVDF is limited.For example, if the UVA is added in a large amount, phase separation occurs, deteriorating the transparency, and the UVA which bleeds to the surface of the PVDF surface layer may flow away by rainwater or evaporate.In the case of using the WA in an amount so as not to cause phase separation, it has been confirmed that if the thickness of the PVDF surface layer is greatly reduced to obtain a transparent laminated product as described above, the amount of the UVA contained in thePVDF layer is very small and as a result it becomes difficult to prevent the underlying resin layer from the deterioration by ultraviolett rays. The object of the invention is to provide a laminated product having a polyvinylidene fluoride film as at least one surface layer, which can maintain a good surface state even after being exposed to atmospheric conditions for a long period of time and at the same time, is at least substantially free from deterioration by ultraviolet rays. According to the invention, there is provided an extrusion laminated product comprising at least three thermoplastic resin layers, characterized in that at least one surface layer of the product comprises polyvinylidene fluoride, and in that an adhesive layer which is provided between the or each surface layer and the remainder of the thermoplastic resin layers comprises a polymer having either at least one of methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate as a major component or a composition containing said polymer as a major component and from 0.3 to 30 phr of an ultraviolet absorber. Preferably, the or each surface layer comprising polyvinylidene fluoride additionally contains an ultraviolett absorber in an amount up to 3 phr. Preferably, the or each adhesive layer contains from 1 to 15 phr of an ultraviolet absorber. Only a limited number of polymers, such as polymethyl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate are now known to have compatibility with polyvinylidene fluoride, and it has previously been believed that the adhesion properties of the adhesive layer is deteriorated by the addition of a large amount of the WA thereinto. Surprisingly, the addition of the UVA to the adhesive layer does not deteriorate the adhesion properties thereof and does not cause the formation of bubbles during molding. Further, it has previously believed that ultraviolet rays would reach the interface between the PVDF layer and the adhesive layer, causing light deterioration around the interface of the adhesive layer, but it has now been confirmed that the extrusion laminated product has practically sufficient weathering resistance. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example only, to a number of detailed examples of the invention in connection with the single Figure of the drawing which is a graph showing the relation between the thickness of a PVDV layer and the degree of transparency or haze. At least one surface layer of the laminated product according to the invention comprises a polyvinylidene fluoride resin. The polyvinylidene fluoride which can be used in the invention includes a vinylidene fluoride homopolymer, a copolymer comprising at least 70 mol of vinylidene fluoride and one or more comonomers copolymerizable therewith, such as tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene, trifluoroethylene, ethylene trifluorochloroethylene or vinyl fluoride, and 2 composition comprising at least one of the above described homopolymer and copolymer and one or more polymer having compatibility therewith. The polyvinylidene fluoride layer may contain an ultraviolet absorber ÙVA , a nucleus forming agent, a plasticizer, and so forth, if desired.In particular, the addition of the FrA in an amount of from 0.1 to 3 phr in the PVDF layer is preferred from the standpoint of improving the weathering resistance, since the formation of stripe like bubbles does not occur as long as the amount of the UVA is small. The upper limit for the thickness of the PVDF layer is nqt particularly limited. However, it can be seen from the Figure that when the thickness of the PVDF layer is in the range of 5 p or less, if the thickness slightly decreases, the hae H, t greatly decreases and also the degree of transparency is greatly improved.Therefore, considered only from the standpoint of transparency, the thickness is preferably 5 p or less. The most preferred thickness is 3 p or less. The lower limit for the thickness of the PVDF layer is also not particularly limited. However, when the thickness of the PVDF layer is less than 0.5 , it is too thin and the surface layer is easily worn out by slight friction. Furthermore, due to the thin surface layer the amount of the UVA which can be incorporated into the PVDF layer becomes very small, resulting in deterioration of the absorption effect of ultraviolet rays. In general, therefore, the thickness of the PVDF layer is preferably at least 0.5 p. An adhesive layer which c an be used in the invention to bond the polyvinylidene fluoride outer layer and another thermoplastic resin layer is composed of a polymer comprising at least one of ethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate as a main structural monomer or a composition containing such a polymer as a major component Ce.g., at least about 50 wt .Examples of the polymer for the adhesive layer are a methyl methacrylate homopolyme r hereinafter referred to as PMMA for brevity , an ethyl methacrylate homopolymer, a copolymer comprising at least 50 molt of at least one of methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate and a monomer, e.g., alkyl methacrylate Cother than methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate an alkyl acrylate such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate or butyl acrylate and so forth, and a composition containing at least one of the above described homo and copolymers. Preferred examples thereof. are homo and copolymers consisting of the above described monomers alone. More preferred examples are PANA, a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate, and a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate.The term copolymer as used herein its not limited to a random copolymer, but includes, for example, a graft copolymer. For example, a copolymer obtained by graft polymerizing a monomer mixture composed mainly of methyl methacrylate onto acrylic saturated cross linked rubber is preferably used. The WA which is incorporated into the adhesive layer may be any conventional WAs. Of those, benzotriazole type and benzophenone type UVAs are preferred. The lower limit for the amount of the tWA added varies depending on the degree of weathering resistance required and the thickness of the adhesive layer. For example, when the thickness of the adhesive layer is small and the amount of the UVA is small, ultraviolet rays reach underlying layers, causing the deterioration thereof. On the other hand, the upper limit for the amount of the UVA added varies depending on the compatibility of the UVA with the polymer which constitutes the adhesive layer. For example, when the compatibility is poor, if the amount of the UVA is increased, the adhesive layer peels off from the polyvinylidene fluoride layer.Thus the amount of the tWA added in the invention is from 0.3 to 30 phr, preferably from 1 to 15 phr, and more preferably from 2 to 5 phr, based on the amount of polymer which constitutes the.adhesive layer. The thermoplastic resin layer which is bonded to the polyvinylidene fluoride layer via the adhesive layer may be made of any conventional thermoplastic resin. Of these conventional thermoplastic resins, resins having an impact resistance such as a polyvinyl chloride resin hereinafter referred to as PVC for brevity , a polycarbonate resin hereinafter referred to as PC for brevity , and an acrylonitrile butadienestyrene resin hereinafter referred to as ABS for brevity are preferably used. The PVC which can be used include a vinyl chloride homopolymer, a copolymer comprising at least 70 molt of vinyl chloride and one or more monomer copolymerizable therewith, and a composition composed mainly of at least one of the homo and copolymers.The PVC may contain additives such as an impact resistance increasing agent, a processing additive, and a filler. The PC which can be used is not limited to conventional polycarbonates, but includes various polycarbonates such as copolycarbonates, hete ro bond copolymers containing a carbonate bond and another bond in the main chain, and compositions composed mainly of the polycarbonates. The ABS which can be used includes a copolymer consisting essentially of acrylonitrile, styrene and butadiene, copolymers additionally containing other monomer such as methyl methacrylate, and compositions composed mainly of such copolymer. A particularly preferred method of preparing the laminated product of the invention is an extrusion molding method which comprises laminating the layers in a multilayer molding die by a coextrusion procedure and extrusion molding the laminate. In addition, other conventional extrusion lamination methods, for example, a method which comprises melt extruding each resin and laminating and bonding the resulting layers outside a molding die by means of rolls or presses, can be used. The shape of the laminated product of the invention is not limited to a planar form, and the laminated product may be a tubular form, a corrugated form and so forth. The laminated product of the invention may be used alone or by laminating it on other substrates. The present invention will be now explained in greater detail by reference to the following Examples and Comparative Examples, but is not limited thereto.Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages, parts, ratios and the like are by weight.
