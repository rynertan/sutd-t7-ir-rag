# A dual component mixing package.

## Abstract
In a dual component packing of the type consisting of a flexible bag 2 , which contains the single liquid components in respective separate compartments 6,10 , from which they may be brought together into a common mixing compart ment 6 by exterior manipulation, a mixing stick 14 is mounted inside the packing so as to be seizable at one end by squeezing together the bag sheet material thereabout, whereafter the free end of the mixing stick by exterior manipulation can be moved around in the mixing compart ment 6 for effectively stirring and mixing the combined liquid components. Exterior pressure manipulations on the bag itself will be superfluous, and for this reason a packing of a simple flat bag type may be bottomwise designed so as to assume a cup shaped form when placed on a substantially planar support surface, whereby an effective mixing stirring by means of the said mixing stick 14 is achievable.
