# Hydraulic control system for a transmission.

## Abstract
A fluid control system 10 for e continuously variable transmission 12 utilizing a first valve 56 which is manually operable, and a second valve 66 operable by a fluid motor 60 which fluid motor 60 also provides engagement and disengagement of two gear ratios. The first valve 56 directs fluid flow from a fluid source 46 to the fluid motor 60 and to the second valve 66 for communication to a fluid actuated starting clutch 30 . Fluid for the clutch 30 and fluid motor 60 are only provided when the first valve 56 is selectively engaged to the first 37 or second 39 operable gear ratios thereby directing fluid from the fluid source 46 to the fluid actuated motor 60 . The fluid motor 60 is operable to move a gear engaging means 35 and simul taneously move the second valve 66 to an aligned port position permitting fluid flow to the starting clutch 30 . The clutch 30 is only engaged when the manually operated valve 56 is in the first 26 or second 28 gear ratio position, therefore, independent park and neutral positions have been obviated by the fact that such a starting clutch 30 is no longer providing power to an output means 44, 45 . In an alternative embodiment a pressure modulator valve 54 is interposed between the fluid source 46 and the first valve, 56 to control the line pressure to the fluid control system 10 . The use of the starting clutch 30 in this fashion obviates the use of a forward clutch to provide driving communication between input 14 and output 44, 45 means.
