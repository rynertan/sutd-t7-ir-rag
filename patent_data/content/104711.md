# Beryllium to metal seals and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Beryllium to metal seals are produced by forming on a beryllium surface by cathode sputtering a first metal layer from a group of metals including tantalum, niobium, zirco nium, hafnium, titanium or vanadium, an intermediate cathode sputtered layer of a refractory metal and outer layer of a readily brazable metal and soldering the readily brazable layer to another metallic body.
