# Plastics material film sheet having a preselected weakened area, process for its manufacture and package made therefrom.

## Abstract
A plastics material film which is formed of two films 13, 15 of thermoplastics material which are self heat bonded together, a first of the films being relatively thick and having resist material 12 thereon in predetermined patterns, and the other of the films being thin as compared to the one film with the other of the films being bonded to the one film at all areas except for the resist area so as to provide a thermo plastics material film sheet of a predetermined thickness which in selected areas only there are two separate films with these areas defining seal forming areas. The film sheet with the seal forming areas may be readily folded and bonded to define pouches or packages having predeter mined weakened seals of a predetermined rupture strength. The two thermoplastics films are heat bonded together or more preferably, the thinner film is cast onto the thicker one.
