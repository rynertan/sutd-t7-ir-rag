# Infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable transmission includes a driver shaft 4 having a driver pulley C , a driven shaft 75 having a driven pulley D , the driver and driven pulleys C, D having fixed conical discs 33, 78 and movable conical discs 34, 79 , the movable conical discs 34, 79 having pressure chambers 40, 83 , an endless belt 101 trained around said driver and driven pulleys C, D , a device 29 for supplying a fluid under pressure to the pressure chambers 40, 83 , a pressure regulating mechanism 94, 210 for regulating the fluid pressure at a prescribed pressure, and a fluid metering mechanism 41 for regulating the amount of the fluid under the prescribed pressure in the pressure chambers. At least one of the pressure regulating mechanism 94, 210 and the fluid metering mechanism 41 is disposed in the driver shaft 4 or the driven shaft 75 . The pressure regulating mechan ism 94, 210 is arranged to discharge an excess amount of the fluid to a lower pressure area when the supplied fluid pressure exceeds a prescribed level and also has passages 110₁, 110₃, 218 for supplying the discharged amount of the fluid as lubricating oil to the endless belt 101 . The fixed conical discs 33, 78 of the driver and driven pulleys C, D are disposed on opposite sides of the endless belt 101 . The fixed conical discs 33, 78 are arranged such that the central axis 101a of the endless belt 101 is inclined with respect to a line normal to pulley axes 4a, 75a at an angle which is substantially zero at a power transmission speed ratio which is most frequently be used between the driver and driven pulleys C, D .
