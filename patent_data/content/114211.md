# Multi layer flexible film module.

## Abstract
A high density electronic circuit module includes a chip 55 carrying, thin, flexible film 30 having circuitry 20, 40 on both sides thereof. The double sided circuitry is fabri cated by depositing a first layer 20 of chrome copper chrome circuitry on an aluminum substrate 10 . This first circuitry layer is covered with a layer of polyimide 30 . Vias 30A, 30B are etched into the polyimide. Next, a second layer of chrome copper chrome circuitry 40 is deposited on top of the polyimide. The first and second layers of circuitry are connected through the etched vias. Finally, hydrochloric acid is utilized to etch away the aluminum substrate. Hydrochloric acid etches aluminum but not the chrome copper chrome circuitry.
