# Linear or branched ester ether block copolymers and their use as surfactants either alone or in blends with conventional surfactants.

## Abstract
Block copolymers useful as surfactants in oil water systems are described. The copolymers comprise at least two polymeric components of molecular weight at least 500 which are derived from an oil soluble complex mono carboxylic acid and a polymeric component of molecular weight at least 500 which is derived from a water soluble polyalkylene glycol. The copolymers may be either oil soluble or water soluble depending on their composition and may be used as wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifiers or emulsion stabilisers. The oil soluble copolymer, and their blends with low molecular weight conventional surfactants, are of particular interest for the emulsification of water in hydrocarbon fuel oils.
