A particularly useful compound of this class is 3,3 dimethyl 1 5 t butylisoxaxol 1 yl urea, which compound is being tested on a large sale as an herbicide. Itermedialtes which are formed in this process are 5 substituted 3 acyl 1,2,4 oxadiazoles, which are also herbicides. The above mentioned patent 4,062, 861 is the most important document which discloses and explains the compounds of formula I belcw, but that documetn shows only the traditional methods for preparing te compounds.

It will be understood that the preferred definitions below may be combined to constitute further, more iimited, classes of preferred acyloxadiazoles and isoxazoles. a R is C1 C6alkyl b R is C3 C5 alkyl c R is C4 alkyl d R1 is hydrogen or methyl e R1 is hydrogen f R2 is NR3R4 g3 R3 and R4 are independently C1 C3 alkyl A h R3 and R are both methyl. All of the starting compounds and reagents used in the process of this invention are known sub stances and are readily obtained or prepared by the ordinarily skilled organic chemist. The reactions described in this decometn proceed according to the expected stoichiometry. One mole of the oxadiazole and 1 mole of the ester react in the presence of 2 moies of the very strong base to prepare 1 mole of the acyloxadiazole, which converts to 1 mole of the isoxazole, No unexpected excess of any of the reagents is necessary. It is advisable, as usual in organic chemistry, to use a small excess, in the range of about 1 to 25 or thereabout, or less expensive or easier to obtain reagents, to assure that the more expensive reagents are fully used Large excesses, even up to 10X or more, may be used if desired and are not harmful to the process, but there is no reason or necessity to use large excesses. The concentration of the reagents in the inert organic solvent is not critical to the process.The reactions have been successfully carried out at a concentration in the range of approxiinately 1 mole per liter of solvent. Higher or lower concentrations, so long as the concentration is not so high that incon lenient precipitation occurs, may be used as is convenient in a given instance, No unusual safety precautions are necessary in carrying out the process of this invention. Neither the order of addition of the reagents, nor the rate of addition, is critical to the success of the process. it is preferable to add the oxadiazole of formula II and the ester to a solution of the base r or to add the ester to a mixture of the base and the oxadiazole. The rate of addition must be sufficiently slow that the cooling system of te reactor can maintain the desired temperature, but the rate of addition is not 5 otherwise significant. The reactor must provide adequate mixing efficiency to avoid localized spots of high concentration of one of the reagents in the reaction mixture.Since the mixture is a solution of moderate viscosity, or a light suspension, the ordinary mixers customarily used in chemical reactors are quite adequate for the process. The process proceeds in a single reactor in to steps, a low temperature step and a high tempera ture step, The product of the low temperature step is the novel acyloxadiazole of formula III which is an embodiment of this invention, and it is recovered from the reaction mixture if the mixture is worked up at low temperature. If the isoxazole of formula I is the desired product, the reaction mixture is heated and the isoxazole is produced in the high temperature step.The yields in both the low and the high temperature seps are extremely high, and essentially no by products are found when the process is carried out at the preferred conditions explained below. In the first step, the oxadiazole of formulaII and the ester are combined in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a very strong base, preferably in one of the two preferred crders of addition discussed above. The substituents R, R1 and R of the starting compounds are those of the desired product of the process, and it is unnecessary to discuss those compounds further, except to note that the ester may be any of the C1 CX alkyl esters of the alkanoic acid having the desired R residue. It has been found that the isobutyl esters are particularly convenient in large scale synthesis, and they are therefore the preferred esters. The preferred organic solvents are ethers, of which tetrahydrofuran is most highly preferred.Also alkyl ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and isopropyl butyl ether are useful, and bis ethers, of which 1,2 dimethoxyethane is a representative frequently used in chemical synthesis, may also be used. It should be noted that some amount of alkane solvent usually enters the reaction mixture along vi,h the very strong base, since such compounds are usually handled as solutions in alkanes, and no ill effects have been found from such additions of alkanes to the reaction mixture. The preferred very strong bases are lithium diisopropylamide and especially sodium diisopropylamide. Lithium diisopropylamide is formed by the reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine, and sodium diisopropylamide is made by reacting sodium metal with diisopropylamine in the presence of isoprene. A preferred class of bases includes the sodium and lithium di C1 C4 alkylamides. Other very strong bases such as are frequently used in organic chemical synthesis may also be used, especiaily the alkyllithiums, represented by ethyllithium, s butyllithium, isopropyllithium, butyllithium and t butyllithium. The reagents and the base are combined at a low temperature from about 100 to about 100. The preferred temperature range for the low temperature step of the process is from about 75 to about 20 , more preferably at from about 75 to about 40 , it is important that the first items added to the reactor, preferably the solvent and the base, or the solvent and the oxadiazole. be chilled down to the desired reaction temperature before the other reagents are added, and that the additions are made with adeauate agitation and at such a rate that the temperature of te reaction mixture remains at the desired level and that no local sized overheated spots occur in the mixture. The formation of the acyloxadiazqle of formula III is usually rapid. Reaction times In the low temperature step of from about 30 minutes to about 12 hours are adequate in most cases brief tomes of about 30 60 minutes are satisfactory. If the acyloxadiazole is to be isolated, it is necessary to neutralize the base in the reaction mixture, and to quench the reaction1 as by the addition of aqueous acid to the reaction mixture. Enough acid should be added to achieve neutrality it is not necessary to use excess acid. When the reaction mixture has been quenched, which step may be carried out at a higher temperature up to about 00, the acyloxadiazole is then isolated from the mixture by conven tionai methods, such as by evaporating the solvent, and then extracting the product from the aqueous remainder with a water imiscible organic solvent. It should be noted that the acyloxadiazole, as it exists in the low temperature reaction mixture, is in a deprotonated form. The hydrogen on the carbon atom attached to the 3 position of te oxadiazole rlng is removed by the base, and that position bears a negative charge and is probably bonded to an alkali metal ion derived from the base, that is to say, a lithium atom in the case of a reaction in the presence of a lithium base. If the process is to be carried on to tine isoxazole, the reaction mixture is neared after the addition of the reagents is complete, and the process enters the high temperature stage. The temperature should be raised to from about the ambient tempera ture in the range from about 150 to about 350 to a maximum of about 1000. A preferred range for the high temperature step is from about the ambient tem perature to about 650. Most conveniently, the step may be carried out at the reflux temperature of the mix ture, particularly when the reaction is carried out in tetrahydrofuran.The process can be carried out under pressure to raise the boiling point, when it is desired to operate at a temperature above the ambient pressure boiling point of the reaction mixture. The high tem perature reaction is rapid, and has ben found usually to be complete within one hour. The reaction time at high temperature is not critical, however, and reaction times from a few minutes to several hours are quite satisfactory. It should be noted that the formation of isoxazoles wherein R2 is aryl or alkyl is slower than is the formation of those wherein R2 is rQR324 Such compounds need longer high temperature reaction periods, or higher temperatures, to ohtain economical yields, When the high temperature reaction is rover, the isoxazole is isolated by neutralizing the strong base, as by the addition of aqueous acid, and removing the product from the neutralized mixture by conven tional methods. It has been found to be convenient to remove the solvent under vacuum, and to extract the product from the aqueous mixture with a water inmisci ble organic solvent. However, other isolation pro cedures will readily occur to organic chemists and can be used as desired. Of course, since the acyloxadiazole compounds of formula III can be isolated in a stable form after the first low temperature step, this inven tion also concerns the one step process. of reacting the acyloxa diazole of formula III preferably in the presence of a base, in a polar organic solvent at a temperature from about the ambient temperature to about 1000C. to obtain the isoxazoles cf ormula I. Suitable polar organic solvents include C1 C4 alkanols, C1 C4 alkanols with water, tetrahydro furan, ethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetonitrile, Bases which can be used can be selected from a wide . variety of well known bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides, for example potassium or sodium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates, for example sodium or potas sium carbonate, trialkylamines, for example trimethyl amne, alkalilithiums, for example butyllithium and alkali metal alkoxides, for example potassium t butoxide. The preferred bases are te alkali metal bases given above. This reaction proceeds est in the presence of base however, under temperatures cm about 90 250 C some conversicn to the isoxazoles of formula I occurs without base present. The isoxazole of formula I, prepared as a one step reaction from the acyloxadiazole of formula IIL, is isolated in the same manner as from the high tempera ture two step procedure. The invention is further explained by the following preparatlve examples. The products of these oxamples were identified by standard analytical tech niques which are identified in the text of the indi vidual examples. The first example below illustrates the synthesis and isolation of a typical acyloxadiazole. Example 1 5 dimethylamino 3 2,2 dimethylpropionylmethyl 1,2.4 oxadiazole Lithium diisopropylamide was prepared by the addition of 1.6 ml. of 1.6 molar butyllithium solution in hexane at 0 to 2.9 ml. of diisopropylamine in 20 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred at 00. for one hour, and then cooled to 780. A solution of 1.26 g. of 5 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2,4 oxadiazole and 4.0 ml. of methyl pivalate in 10 ml. of tetrahydro furan was then added over a period of 28 minutes at constant temperature, and rinsed in with an additional 2 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred at 78 for 30 minutes, and then the flask was wamed in an ice bath for 30 minutes.The reaction was then quenched by addition of 42 ml. of cold 1N hydrochloric acid, and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The aqueous mixture was ten diluted wth 75 ml. of diethyl ether, the layers were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted again with 25 ml. of diethyl ether. The organic phases were combined, washed with 20 ml. each of water and saturated aqueous sodium chloried, and dried over sodium sulfate.The organics were then con centrated under vacuum to obtain 2.0 g. of a yellow solid, which was identified by nuclear magnetic reso nance nmr analysis as the desired product in essen tially pure form. Recrystallization from diethyl ether gave colorless plates. m.p. 73,5 74 proton nmr CDCl3 3.75 s, 2H , 3.11 s, 6h , 1.22 s, 9H . The following group of examples illustrate the synthesis of the preferred isoxazole of this in vention at various temperatures. Example 2 1 5 t butylisoxazol 3 yl 3,3 dimethylurea A 12.6 ml. portion of 1.6 molar butyllithium solution in hexane was reacted with 2.9 ml. of diiso propylamine at 0 in 20 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was stirred at 0 for 105 minutes. To it was added 1.3 g. of 5 dimethylamino 3 methyl 1,2,4 oxa diazole, 4.0 ml. of methyl pivalate and 10 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, over a period of 30 minutes, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes more, maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 780.
