# Magnetic transducing head assemblies.

## Abstract
A thin film magnetic head assembly incorporates a non conductive magnetic substrate 10 , which serves as a first pole piece and a thin film magnetic layer 34 for the second pole piece. A magnetoresistive MR element 28 is disposed between the pole pieces. During the write mode, the MR element 28 serves as a partial write turn to enhance the write signal current applied to a conductor means 18 . During the read mode, the conductor means 18 serves as a magnetic shield, and the transducing gap 30 is effectively narrowed.
