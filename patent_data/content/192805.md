# Composite material made from matrix metal reinforced with mixed crystalline alumina silica fibers and mineral fibers.

## Abstract
This composite material includes reinforcing hybrid fiber mixture material in a matrix of metal which is aluminum, magnesium, copper, zinc, lead, tin, or an alloy having these as principal components. The hybrid fiber mixture is a mixture of crystalline alumina silica fiber material and mineral fiber material. The crystalline alumina silica fiber material has as principal components 35 to 80 by weight of Al₂O₃ and 65 to 20 by weight of SiO₂, with a content of other substances of less than or equal to 10 by weight, with the percentage of mullite being greater than or equal to 15 by weight, and with the percentage of non fibrous particles with diameters greater than 150 microns being less than or equal to 5 by weight. And the mineral fiber material has as principal components SiO₂, CaO, and Al₂O₃, the content of MgO being less than or equal to 10 by weight, the content of Fe₂O₃ being less than or equal to 5 by weight, and the content of other inorganic substances being less than or equal to 10 by weight, with the percentage of non fibrous particles being less than or equal to 20 by weight, and with the percentage of non fibrous particles with diameters greater than 150 microns being less than or equal to 7 by weight. The volume proportion of the reinforcing hybrid fiber material is at least 1 . The qualities of this composite material with regard to wear, wear on a mating member, and bending strength are good.
