## Description
LABELLING SYSTEM FOR SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAYS Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to specific binding assays employing enzyme labels, and more particularly to a novel labelling system employing biotinylated firefly luciferase. A wide variety of specific binding assays are known. Such assays may be heterogeneous or homogeneous, competitive or noncompetitive, and may employ any one of a number of labels, including radioisotopes, enzymes, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, bioluminescers, and other detectable molecules. When devising an assay protocol, it is critical that all aspects of the protocol be able to function together. This is a particular concern when developing an assay employing an enzyme label since enzyme activity can be inhibited by many factors, including conjugation of the enzyme to a specific binding protein or ligand, as well as by steric inhibition which occurs during the binding reactions in the assay itself. For these reasons, it is never possible to predict with certainty whether a particular enzyme label can be adapted to assay protocols where it has not been used previously. Moreover, it is highly desirable that modified enzyme labelling reagents remain stable over relatively long periods, on the order of months rather than days, so that the reagents can be prepared in advance and distributed in kits which may be utilized sometime later. Firefly luciferase offers a number of advantages when used as a label in a specific binding assays. The enzyme may be detected substantially instantaneously in the presence of appropriate substrates, in contrast to other enzymes which require the accumulation of product over time for detection.Moreover, very low levels of firefly luciferase, on the order of 10 16M, and below, may be detected. Such sensitivity can lower the cost of the assay since reagent usage can be reduced. Firefly luciferase, however, is easily inactivated when conjugated to other molecules and has not heretofore enjoyed widespread use as a labelling reagent in specific binding assays. Certain assay protocols have been developed which utilize biotin and avidin as intermediate binding compounds. Typically, a biotinylated primary reagent specific for the antigen of interest is first reacted with the sample. The sample can either be a liquid assay medium containing solubilized antigen or a solid phase on which the antigen has been immobilized. After the reaction is complete, the primary reagent bound to the antigen may be separated from the reaction medium and thereafter reacted with labelled avidin. Alternatively, the primary reagent can be unlabelled and a secondary biotinylated reagent capable of binding the primary reagent utilized.Labelled avidin is then reacted with the secondary reagent. This latter method provides for amplification of the label and allows the use of a common biotinylated reagent for detection of a number of different antigens. It would be desirable to provide an assay which combines the advantages of using a firefly luciferase label with those of using biotin and avidin as intermediate labelling substances. In particular, it would be desirable to provide a biotinylated luciferase which retains a high percentage of its activity for use in such assays. 2. Description of the Prior Art Specific binding assays using firefly luciferase as a label are known. See, e.g., U.S.Patent No. 4,380,580, and Schroeder et al. 1976 Anal.Chem. 48 1933 1937. Specific binding assays using biotin and avidin as intermediate binding substances are known. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,228,237. The use of biotin and avidin in enzymatic histochemical staining is known. See, e.g., Hsu et al. 1981 J.Histo. Chem. Cytochem. 29 577 580, and VectorLaboratories, Inc., Burlingame, California, 1982Catalogue, pp. 8 9. A method for conjugating firefly luciferase to particular antigens has been taught byWannlund et al. 1980 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.96 440 446, and Wannlund and DeLuca 1983 Methods InEnzymology 92 426 432. Assays for determining total and specific IgE are known. See, e.g., U.S. PatentsNos. 4,347,311 and 4,292,403. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a heterogeneous immunoassay employing a biotin firefly luciferase conjugate biotinylated firefly luciferase as a label. The biotinylated firefly luciferase is characterized by retention of at least 50 of the activity of the unmodified luciferase. The assay generally detects antigen which has been immobilized onto a solid phase, typically by reaction with an immobilized receptor specific for the antigen.Biotinylated firefly luciferase and avidin are then reacted with exposed solid phase in a predetermined order. The biotinylated luciferase can be detected by reaction with the appropriate substrate and the amount of antigen present in the sample determined based on the amount of bound or unbound luciferase. Description of the Specific Embodiments The present invention is suitable for quantitating the amount of bound ligand or antigen immobilized on a solid phase. Typically, the ligand will be immobilized by reaction between a first receptor specific for the ligand bound to the solid phase and a liquid assay medium suspected of containing the ligand. By providing excess first receptor, the entire amount of ligand present in the sample can be bound. After the solid phase is removed from the assay medium, it is reacted with a second receptor which has been conjugated to a plurality of biotin moities. The second receptor will be specific for the ligand and may be the same substance or a different substance than the first receptor. Excess second receptor is provided so that all bound ligand is reacted.The solid phase is further reacted with free avidin and biotinylated firefly luciferase to form bridged labelling complexes.The biotinylated second receptor, avidin and biotinylated firefly luciferase may be combined sequentially or simultaneously, or the avidin and biotinylated firefly luciferase may be preformed into a complex and reacted with the solid phase subsequent to reaction with the biotinylated second receptor. Although the present invention is suitable for detection of any ligand which can be immobilized on a solid phase, it is particularly useful for the determination of total IgE and specific IgE in the blood. IgE is present in normal serum at very low concentrations on the order of 10 5 to 10 4 mg per ml. The detection of elevated serum IgE levels can be useful in the diagnosis of a patient s allergic response. The sensitivity of the present assay makes it particularly suitable for the determination of IgE levels. Moreover, firefly luciferase, unlike other enzyme labels obtained from bacterial and other sources, will almost certainly not be present in human sera and will not therefore interfere with the assay or provide undesirable background. In the exemplary IgE assays, the first receptor will be either anti IgE for determining totalIgE or a particular allergen characteristic of an IgE class, i.e., particular grasses, trees, drugs, microbial antigens, food antigens, and the like.Anti human IgE can be obtained commercially from a number of sources, including Tago, Burlingame,California. Particular antibodies against allergens which might be detected by the assay of the present invention include grasses, such as bent grass, perennial rye grass, and the like dander, such as dog dander, cat dander, and the like foods, such as apple, spinach, shrimp, and the like insect venom, such as mosquito venom, wasp venom, bee venom, and the like trees, such as elm, oak, acacia, and the like bacteria, such asDiplococcus, Pneumoniae, and the like viruses, such as hepatitis virus, and the like flowers, such as marigold, sunflower, and the like and weeds, such as pigweed, ragweed, Russian thistle, and the like. This is only a partial list, and it will be appreciated that many other allergens may be detected in serum using the assay of the present invention. As stated above, the first receptor either anti IgE or allergen will be immobilized to a solid carrier or solid phase by conventional techniques. The solid phase may be any water soluble solid carrier where coupling may be effected by means of covalent bonds, adsorption, or the like. In particular, the solid phase may comprise beads, strips, test tubes, microtiter plates, and other constructions which facilitate exposure to the serum sample. The solid phase support of the present invention may be constructed from a wide variety of materials and need not be formed from a single material. In the broadest sense, it is necessary only that the material selected be capable of being formed into the desired geometry, be insoluble in the assay medium, and have the ability to covalently or non covalently bond the first receptor without otherwise interfering with the binding between the first receptor and the ligand. Preferred are synthetic polymeric resins, such as polyacrylamide, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl compounds such as polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, and co polymers thereof. Immobilization of the first receptor can be achieved by a wide variety of known techniques.Depending on the nature of the particular material, as well as on the nature of the receptor i.e., IgE or allergen physical absorption or adsorption may be employed. Preferably, the first receptor will be covalently bonded to the surface of the solid phase support. The surface can be activated or spacer arms can be covalently bonded to the surface by various techniques well known in the art, leaving a functionality which is either active or can be activated to react with the receptor. For example, nitriles can be modified to form imido esters, which will react with the available amino groups on the antibody or antigen. There is extensive literature concerning such bonding of proteins to surfaces employing activated carboxylic acids, carbodiimides, imido esters, active alkyl halides, etc., to form amido, amide, or amino linkages. To immobilize antigens, particularly allergens, it is preferred to use glutaraldehyde both to activate the solid phase and to cross link the allergens as they are bound to the solid phase. Any solid phase having available amino groups, such as polyacrylamide, polystyrene, polypropylene, and the like, or which may be modified to have amino groups, such as nylon, many be activated with glutaraldehyde.Conveniently, the solid phase is reacted with about 1 glutaraldehyde in a basic buffer e.g., 0.1M carbonate, pH 9.0 and reacted at an elevated temperature for about 1 2 hours. After a thorough washing, the solid phase is reacted with the allergen, typically diluted about 1 8 in PBS, in the presence of about 0.01 0.1 glutaraldehyde by weight. The glutaraldehyde promotes cross linking of the allergens as they bind to the activated amino groups on the solid phase. The reaction is carried out in the cold 40C for several hours, preferably overnight. Solid phases prepared by this technique are found to have improved binding capacities when compared to those prepared by conventional techniques. The biotinylated second receptor can be obtained commercially or prepared by conventional techniques. In the exemplary assays, the second receptor will be anti human IgE , and both the unmodified antibody and the biotinylated antibody are available from commercial sources, such as Tago andVector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, California.Alternatively, antibodies can be biotinylated by conventional techniques. Typically, antibody is reacted with a biotin derivative, such as a biotin ester, i.e., N hydroxysuccinimide ester Biosearch, SanRafael, California . The biotin ester is dissolved in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, and is combined in molar excess with the antibody. The mixture is allowed to react at a low temperature, typically from 2 to 100C for a number of hours. After completion of the reaction, the biotinylated antibody may be separated by known techniques. Particular methods for preparing biotinylated antibodies are taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,298,685, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The avidin utilized in the method of the present invention is available from a number of commercial sources, including Vector Laboratories,Inc., Burlingame, California. The biotinylation of the firefly luciferase is critical. The firefly luciferase must retain at least 50 of the activity of the unmodified enzyme, preferably at least 60 or greater. Firefly luciferase may be obtained from commercial vendors, such as SigmaChemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri. The firefly luciferase may be combined with N hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester in a phosphate buffer to achieve linkage through the amino groups on the enzyme. The weight ratio of firefly luciferase to biotin ester should be in the range from about 1 1 to 1 10, preferably in the range from about 1 4 to 1 8 luciferase biotin ester, molar ratio . The luciferase and biotin ester should be combined in the presence of substrate, or a substrate analog, in order to protect the active site of the enzyme during derivatization. Conveniently, adenosine triphosphate should be present at about 5mM.Biotinylated firefly luciferase prepared in this manner retains a high percentage above 50 of its activity for extended periods. For the most part, the method of the invention will be used to quantitate the amount of ligand or antigen present in a biological sample such as blood, serum, urine, or solid tissue. Methods for preparing such biological samples for immunological assays are well known. Blood and serum samples will be mixed with an appropriate buffer prior to combination with the remaining assay reagents. For the exemplaryIgE assays, it will often be desirable to dilute the blood sample to lower the concentration of IgE to within the useful range of the assay. In particular, it has been found that by including a combination of detergents in the assay medium, preferably 0.1 Tween and 0.1 Triton X 100 by weight, the background light emission is greatly reduced. In the case of solid biological specimens, it will be necessary to solubilize the specimen in a liquid assay medium. Once the liquid assay medium has been prepared, it will be incubated with the immobilized first receptor solid phase until equilibrium has been reached. For the binding of IgE to its specific allergen or to anti human IgE , this will usually take from one to two hours at 370C. After separating the assay medium, the solid phase is washed to remove all unbound antibodies. The solid phase is next reacted with the biotinylated second receptor, e.g., biotinylated anti human IgE . In this way, biotin is immobilized on the solid phase in direct proportion to the amount of IgE or specific IgE in the sample. To complete the labelling, the solid phase is reacted with free avidin and the biotinylated firefly luciferase in a predetermined order. Preferably, the avidin and firefly luciferase are added sequentially or simultaneously. Alternatively, the avidin and firefly luciferase may be pre reacted to form a labelling complex prior to reaction with the solid phase. In either case, the weight ratio of avidin to biotinylated firefly luciferase should be in the range from about 10 1 to 100 1 avidin biotinylated firefly luciferase . Once the above reactions are complete, the amount of firefly luciferase bound may be detected by reaction with the appropriate substrates, i.e., adenosine triphosphate and luciferin, in the well known manner. The amount of light generated is directly proportional to the amount of ligand in the sample.The light may be measured conventionally using a photometer and photomultiplier tube. The amount of ligand present in the sample may then be determined by comparison to standard curves prepared by assaying samples having known amounts of ligand in the manner just described. The following experiments are offered by way of example and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTAL All percentages are by weight unless otherwise noted.

The fractions exhibiting luciferase activity referring to both the intrinsic activity of the enzyme and the ability of the enzyme to catalyze a bioluminescent reaction when employed in the assay of the present invention were pooled. The pool was made 0.2 with ovalbumin in an effort to stabilize the dilute enzyme. This preparation did not last, as the enzyme activity quickly died out. Enzyme activity was assessed by reacting the preparation with immobilized avid in and thereafter exposing the reaction product to luciferin and ATP and measuring the light generated.The observed enzyme activity thus included the effect of conjugation on the intrinsic activity of the enzyme as well as the ability of the conjugate to bind the avidin. 2.

After a 15 min. incubation at room temperature, the tubes were washed and the light read.The results were as follows Reference PatientIgE IU ml Light Number IgE IU ml 100 ml 3.67 1 878 50 ml 2.66 2 819 20 ml 1.80 3 289 7.5 ml 1.58 4 358 2.5 ml 1.22 5 566 6 519 7 110 8 105 9 1217 10 2893 The above results were compared against measurements taken with a commercial IgE assay kit PRIST, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Piscataway, NJ , and a 98 correlation was established. Comparison of luciferase and alkaline phosphatase labels The following assays were performed to compare the sensitivity of assay of the present invention using luciferase as the label with an identical assay protocol except that alkaline phosphatase was used as the label. Glutaraldehyde 1 in carbonate buffer 100V1, pH 9.3, 0.1M was added to standard polypropylene tubes and left for 60 minutes at 48 cm. After washing twice without cooling with 0.9 saline 2ml , 100p1 of either anti HGG Sigma or anti gM Sigma diluted 1 40 in PBS with 0.025 glutaraldehyde were added to the tubes, and the tubes were incubated at RT for 90 minutes. After washing three times withQS lml , patient serum 100p1 diluted in BQS was added to each tube and allowed to incubate for 90 minutes at 37 C. Biotinylated anti IgG 1 200 or anti IgM 1 400 in BQS was then added and allowed to incubate for 60 minutes at 370C. After aspirating the serum, avidin in BQS 20pg ml, 100p1 was added to each tube and incubated for 15 minutes.Biotinylated luciferase 100p1 , 1 4000 dilution in BQS or biotinylated alkaline phosphatase Sigma, 71F 3928, 1 500 dilution in BQS were next added to each tube. After incubation for 15 minutes at RT, the tubes were washed twice with QS lml and once with Tris BSA 0.5ml . To the tubes which received the biotinylated luciferase were added 200p1 of 10 luciferin ATP in Tris buffer. The light emission from these tubes was then read immediately, and the results recorded.To the tubes which received the biotinylated alkaline phosphatase were added substrate 300p1 . After sitting at room temperature for one hour, the tubes were read in a spectrophotometer and the results recorded. The results were as follows IgG IgM Concentration Alkalineê Alkalineê g ml LuciferaseÚ Phosphatase LuciferaseÚ Phosphatase 1.0 23.6 1.33 17.58 1.16 2x10 1 14.16 0.75 3.82 0.30 4x10 2 4.76 0.30 1.79 0.16 8x10 3 1.34 0.08 0.78 0.04 1.6x10 3 0.58 0.03 0.75 0.07 3.2x10 4 0.42 0.03 0.53 0.07 6.4x10 5 0.46 0.08 0.83 0.10 1.28x10 5 0.55 0.14 0.66 0.06 2.5x10 6 0.46 0.03 0.64 0.05 Control 0.22 0.01 0.18 0.00 1. Reading in light units measured on photometer. Average of three measurements. 2. Read is AOD at 405 nm. Average of three measurements. As can be seen from these results, the luciferase label is sensitive to a concentration of about 1.6x10 3 g ml, while the alkaline phosphatase label is sensitive only to 4x10 2 g ml. The difference in sensitivity is thus about 25 fold, with the absolute sensitivity of the luciferase in the range of lng ml. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
