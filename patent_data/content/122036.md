## Description
This invention relates to a powdery pharmaceutical composition adepted for nasal administration. More specifically, this invention relates to a powdery composition adepted for nasal administration which comprises a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative, such as calcitonin or insulin, and a water absorbing and water insoluble base selected from celluloses, starches and cross linked vinyl polymers and which allows said polypeptide or its derivative to be effectively absorbed through the nasal mucosa when nasally administered. Because of the fact that peptide hormones such as insulin and calcitonin have a high molecular weight and that they are readily decomposed by proteolytic enzymes, such as pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin, the peptide hormones are not absorbed sufficiently to display a pharmacological effect efficaciously and accordingly they have been administered by parenteral injection. However, since the administration by injection causes pain, various attempts to develop alternative methods of administration have been made. For example, there is a method of intrarectal administration of a suppository prepared by use of such salicylic acid derivatives as sodium salicylate, 3 methoxy sodium salicylate, and 5 methoxysalicylic acid as an absorption aid J. Pharmacol., 33, 334, 1981 . Besides this method, a method of intrabronchial administration Diabetes, 20, 552, 1971 and a method of eye dropping administration Diabetes Society s Epitomes, 237, 1974 have been studied. There are, however, drawbacks to all of these methods in that they require much larger doses than injection and that their absorption is varied and accordingly any of them have hardly been put to practical use as yet. On the other hand, there is known a method of nasal administration of an acidic aqueous solution of insulin, whereas such a surface active agent as sodium glycocholate is used as an absorption aid, as an attempt to develop a method of intranasal administration Diabetes, 27, 296, 1978 . However, this method may not be regarded as an expedient means, since the preparation is prepared in the form of a liquid, often causing the drug to flow out of the nasal cavity upon its administration into the nose and the use of a surface active agent in its preparation also causes inconvenience. As a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration, US A 4,294,829 discloses a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a lower alkyl ether of cellulose and a drug. This pharmaceutical composition is characterized in that its lower alkyl ether of cellulose absorbs moisture on the nasal mucous membrane, and takes the form of a viscous liquid to slowly flow over the nasal mucosa and release the drug slowly. Since a composition of this type takes the form of a viscous liquid in the nasal cavity, a drug with a high molecular weight tends to stay within the lower alkyl ether of cellulose and becomes difficult to release from the composition. The composition of this type should, therefore, still undergo a significant improvement if it is to use such a drug with a high molecular weight as calcitonin or insulin. DE A 2 535 258 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for use in a mouth inhaler. The composition comprises soft pellets having a size from 10 to 1000 µm which breaks down on inhalation to particles having a size of less than 10 µm so that the particles can lodge in the lungs. One of the objects of this invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration. Another object of this invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration aimed at application of a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative. A further object of this invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration which allows a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative to be absorbed efficiently through the nasal mucosa without the use of an absorption aid. Still another object of this invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration which especially allows polypeptides, such as insulin and calcitonin, to be absorbed efficiently through the nasal mucosa without the use of an absorption aid. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration which allows a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative to be absorbed efficiently through the nasal mucosa and which also has a sustained release effect. It is still another object of this invention to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration having such a proper particle diameter as to make it possible to be administered efficiently in the nasal cavity when intranasally sprayed. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. According to this invention, these objects and advantages are achieved by a powdery pharmaceutical composition adepted for nasal administration which comprises i a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative ii a water absorbing and water insoluble base selected from celluloses, starches and cross linked vinyl polymers and iii optionally a water absorbing and water soluble base, said water absorbing and water soluble base being present in an amount of 0.1 to 60 wt , against the water absorbing and water insoluble base wherein at least 90 wt. of the particles of said composition have an effective diameter ranging from 10 to 250 µm and wherein said particles do not disintegrate on spraying, provided that the composition does not comprise a mixture of bacitracin and starch. In the accompanying drawings As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the powdery pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration is a composition which allows a polypeptide such as insulin to be absorbed at a satisfactorily high efficiency. In this invention, the objective drug is a physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative. As the polypeptide or its derivative, a polypeptide or its derivative with a molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 300,000 are desirable in view of the fact that they are easily absorbed through the nasal mucous membrane. Especially those having a molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 150,000 are more desirable. Desirable physiologically active polypeptides or their derivatives are exemplified in the following. For instance, such peptide hormones as insulin, angiotensin, vasopressin, desmopressin, felypressin, protirelin, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, corticotropin, prolactin, somatropin, thyrotropin, luteinizing hormone, calcitonin, kallikrein, parathryin, glucagon, oxytocin, gastrin, secretin, serum gonadotrophin, growth hormone, erythropoietin, urogastrone and renin such physiologically active proteins as interferon, interleukin, transferrin, histaglobulin, macrocortine and blood coagulation factor VIII such enzyme proteins as lysozyme and urokinase such vaccines as acellular and cellular pertussis vaccine, diphtheria vaccine, tetanus vaccine, and influenza vaccine and such toxoids as diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and toxoids of lymphocytosis promoting factor, and filamentors hemagglutinin those are contained in acellular pertussis vaccine developed recently in Japan may be mentioned. Of these polypeptides or their derivatives mentioned above, peptide hormones, physiologically active proteins and vaccines are desirable, and peptide hormones are especially more desirable. Among these peptide hormones, calcitonin, insulin, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, desmopressin, vasopressin and oxytocin are particularly desirable and calcitonin and insulin are more particularly desirable. Among physiologically active proteins, interferon is particularly desirable, and among vaccines, influenza vaccine and pertussis vaccine are particularly desirable. For the preparation of powdery pharmaceutical compositions for nasal administration, the physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative is preferred to be one in the form of a powder. The physiologically active polypeptide or its derivative should desirably be water soluble in view of the fact it is to be absorbed through the nasal mucous membrane. Here, water soluble means that the polypeptide or its derivative is soluble on the human nasal mucous membrane or in a similar environment, or more concretely, it is soluble in an aqueous solution at pH around 7.4 at a temperature of about 36 C to 37 C. In case where polypeptides which are water insoluble or hardly soluble in water are to be used, it is accordingly advisable, for instance, to adjust their pH, dissolve in water, and freeze dry, thus making them water soluble and in the form of powder. Those polypeptides which are not in the form of powder should desirably be freeze dried into powder before use. The aforementioned polypeptide or its derivative can be used in combination with human serum albumin, mannitol, sorbitol, aminoacetic acid, amino acid, sodium chloride or phospholipid for the purpose of stabilization, or for the dual purpose of stabilizing and bulking. In the preparation of powdery pharmaceutical compositions for nasal administration according to the present invention, a base having a duplicity of properties of being water absorbing and water insoluble is used. By the terms of water absorbing and water insoluble, it is meant that the base has the double properties of being water absorbing and water insoluble on the human nasal mucous membrane or in a similar environment, or more concretely, it is water absorbing and water insoluble at pH around 7.4 and at a temperature of 36 C to 37 C or thereabout. Because of the use of a water absorbing and water insoluble base, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are able to absorb the moisture on the nasal mucous membrane upon its administration into the nasal cavity, thus making each particle, which is not in the state of a viscous fluid and does not flow away immediately but diffuses moderately, stay at the site on the nasal mucosa where it adhered and allows the polypeptide or its derivative with a high molecular weight to come into thorough contact with the nasal mucosa, through which they are absorbed at a high efficiency. In this invention, the selection of such a base as mentioned above for use as the base of a polypeptide or its derivative preparation for nasal application has made it possible to make the polypeptide or its derivative be absorbed effectively and let it display its pharmacological efficacy sufficiently without the use of an absorption aid. The water absorbing and water insoluble bases which are to be used in this invention should be distinguished from those lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, or more particularly such lower alkyl ethers of cellulose as hydroxypropyl cellulose which dissolve into a viscous fluid on the nasal mucous membrane. As the desirable examples of the water absorbing and water insoluble base, the following ones may be mentioned. They include, for instance, water absorbing and water insoluble celluloses such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose, α cellulose, and cross linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose water absorbing and water insoluble starches such as hydroxypropyl starch, carboxymethyl starch, cross linked starch, amylose, amylopectin and pectin and cross linked vinyl polymers such as cross linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cross linked carboxyvinyl polymer or its salt, cross linked polyvinyl alcohol and polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate. Of these mentioned above, water absorbing and water insoluble celluloses and cross linked vinyl polymer are desirable, water absorbing and water insoluble celluloses are more desirable and crystalline cellulose is especially desirable. Among cross linked vinyl polymers, cross linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and cross linked carboxy vinyl polymer or its salt are desirable. Since the quantity of a water absorbing and water insoluble base to be used varies depending upon the polypeptide or its derivative to be used, it cannot be defined indiscriminately however, it is desirable in general to use it in appreciable amount of more than 10 times the weight of the polypeptide or its derivative especially more than 15 times, furthermore more than 20 times. In preparing a pharmaceutical composition of this invention, said water absorbing and water soluble base may be used in combination with a water absorbing and water insoluble base. The combined use of a water absorbing and water soluble base adds some degree of solubility to a water absorbing and water insoluble base to produce the following effect. When the pharmaceutical composition is intranasally administered, the particles which comprise a water absorbing and water insoluble base and a polypeptide or its derivative are dispersed over the nasal mucous membrane, and the water absorbing and water soluble base is dissolved into the state of a viscous fluid, which gives some degree of viscosity and flowage to the whole base of this invention, thus allowing the polypeptide or its derivative to be absorbed slowly, which is known as a sustained release effect. The water absorbing and water soluble base may be used by simply mixing it with the water absorbing and water insoluble base or by mixing it with the polypeptide or its derivative at the time of their freeze drying. In the case where the water absorbing and water soluble base is freeze dried together with the polypeptide or its derivative, the mixture assumes a state in which particles of the polypeptide or its derivative are dispersed among particles of the water absorbing and water soluble base and the final product of pharmaceutical composition comes to have much more sustained relese effect. As the water absorbing and water soluble base to be used in this invention, there are, for instance, polyacrylates such as sodium polyacrylate, potassium polyacrylate and ammonium polyacrylate lower alkyl ethers of cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polvyinyl pyrrolidone amylose polyethyleneglycol and pullulan. Of those mentioned above, polyacrylates such as sodium polyacrylate lower alkyl ethers of cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyethyleneglycol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone are especially desirable. The quantity of water absorbing and water soluble base to be used should be 0.1 to 60 wt , or desirably 1 to 50 wt , against the water absorbing and water insoluble base. In this invention, at least 90 wt particles of the powdery composition have an effective diameter of 10 to 250 µm. By controlling the particle diameter of the particles of the powdery composition in the abovementioned range, it becomes possible to have the powdery composition diffused widely over the nasal mucous membrane when intranasally administered, to make the powdery composition stay longer at the place where it has adhered, and to facilitate the efficient intranasal administration upon pernasal spraying of the powdery composition through the nostril. When a powdery composition which contains more than 10 wt particles having an effective diameter of less than 10 µm is nasally administered by spraying, more particles will go further into the lungs or escape from the nostrils. Also, such a powdery composition has difficulty in maintaining its effective drug concentration at a high level. On the other hand, when a powdery composition which contains more than 10 wt particles having an effective diameter of more than 250 µm is intranasally administered, part of the particles on the nasal mucous membrane will readily separate from there, thus undesirably making its efficacy less stayable. It is especially desirable to control the powdery composition to have more than 90 wt its particles measuring 20 to 150 µm in effective diameter. The powdery composition of this invention may have any of the structures such as one in which the water absorbing and water insoluble base and polypeptide or its derivative form independent particles, one in which the polypeptide or its derivative particles are adhered to the surface of the water absorbing and water insoluble base particle, one in which the polypeptide or its derivative particles are dispersed in the water absorbing and water insoluble base particle, both forming separate phases of their own, or one in which the polypeptide or its derivative particles are closely dispersed in the water absorbing and water insoluble base particle, thus forming uniform dispersion. The powdery composition of this invention, which has a structure in which the water absorbing and water insoluble base and polypeptide or its derivative form independent particles or the polypeptide or its derivative particles are adhered to the surface of the water absorbing and water insoluble base particles, can be prepared by first adding polypeptide or its derivative to a water absorbing and water insoluble base, then mixing them by a mechanical process, and finally filtering them to obtain the desired composition with more than 90 wt of its particles measuring 10 to 250 µm in effective diameter. In case where a water absorbing and water soluble base is used in combination with a water absorbing and water insoluble base, both bases may be mixed together simultaneously with the polypeptide or its derivatives in the mechanical mixing process. The powdery composition of this invention, which has a structure in which the polypeptide or its derivative particles are dispersed in the water absorbing and water insoluble base particles, both forming separate phases of their own, or the polypeptide or its derivative particles are closely dispersed in the water absorbing and water insoluble base particles, thus forming a uniform dispersion, can be obtained by following the procedure mentioned below. It is prepared by firstly mixing the polypeptide or its derivative with a water absorbing and water insoluble base by mechanical means, then compacting the obtained mixture under pressure, further pulverizing the compacted mixture, and finally filtering the resulting pulverulence to obtain the desired composition with more than 90 wt its particles measuring 10 to 250 µm in effective diameter. The powdery composition can also be obtained by thoroughly mixing the polypeptide or its derivative with a water absorbing and water insoluble base in water to make a thin smooth pasty mixture, drying and pulverizing the mixture according to ordinary methods, and finally passing the pulverized composition through a sieve. In the case where a water absorbing and water soluble base is to be used jointly, it may be admixed with the polypeptide or its derivative and a water absorbing and water insoluble base in the mechanical mixing process, followed by the abovementioned processes of compacting, etc., or a water absorbing and water soluble base may be introduced into the process wherein the polypeptide or its derivative is mixed with a water absorbing and water insoluble base in the presence of water. There is also another method of obtaining a powdery composition by joint use of a water absorbing and water soluble base, wherein a water absorbing and water soluble base is added to the polypeptide or its derivative in the process in which the polypeptide or its derivative is to be freeze dried, thus both components being freeze dried simultaneously as mentioned above. In order to improve the properties, appearance or odor of the powdery pharmaceutical composition of this invention, it may, if desired, contain any of the known additives such as coloring agents, preservatives, antiseptics, corrigents, etc. As the coloring agents, there are, for instance, β carotene, Red No. 2 and Blue No. 1 as the preservatives, there are for instance stearic acid, ascorbyl stearate and ascorbic acid as the antiseptics, there are for instance p hydroxybenzoate, phenol and chlorobutanol, and as the corrigents, there are for instance menthol and citrus perfume. The powdery pharmaceutical composition of this invention can be directly used as a powder for a unit dosage form. As the desirable form for administration, the powder can be filled in capsules such as hard gelatin capsules. As the method of pernasally applying the powdery preparation to the nasal cavity by spraying, there is, for instance, a method in which a capsule filled with the powdery preparation is placed in a sprayer, which is exclusively designed for this purpose and equipped with a needle, then the capsule is pierced with the needle to have minute holes on both the top and bottom, and thereafter jets of powder are sent into the nasal cavity by means of ballooning, etc. The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically however, it should be understood that these examples are given to explain the invention and not to limit the scope of the invention. 3 units kg of the respective powdery compositions of insulin prepared in Example 1, a , b , d , and e were administered intranasally to male Beagle dogs weighing 9.4 to 12.6 kg which were anesthetized by intravenous injection of nembutal containing 50 mg ml of pentobarbital sodium in 25 mg kg doses. The administration of the powdery composition of insulin was carried out by spraying it into the nasal cavity with a double balloon through a polyethylene tube about 2 mm in diameter inserted about 3 cm into the nostril, and blood was withdrawn from the foreleg vein as time passed after the administration. The glucose level of plasma was measured by o toluidine Clinical Chemistry, It is clear from Fig. 1 that the compositions in which crystalline cellulose is used show a highly efficient absorption of insulin and that the composition in which sodium polyacrylate is used in combination with crystalline cellulose show a highly efficient absorption of insulin as well as a sustained release effect. 10 units head of the respective powdery composition of insulin prepared in Example 3, a to c , were administered intranasally to white native male rabbits weighing 3.0 to 3.5 kg .
