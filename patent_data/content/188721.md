# Inverse emulsion polymers with improved incorporation of diallyldimethylammonium chloride.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for improved incorporation of diallyldimethylammonium chloride DADMAC into an acrylamide polymer. This invention makes use of a copolymerizable promoter monomer. Also provided by the present invention are inverse emulsion terpolymers of diallyldimethylammonium chloride. The im proved incorporation resides in the use of a promoter mono mer that is more reactive with acrylamide than is the DAD MAC monomer and is selected from Specific monomers within this formula included, for example, 2 methacryloylethyltrimethylammonium chloride and 2 acryloylethyltrimethylammonium chloride. Typical of such promoter monomers are 2 methacryl oylethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and 2 acryloylethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride.
