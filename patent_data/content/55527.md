# Thermotropic polyester anhydride polymers.

## Abstract
A melt processable aromatic polyester anhydride char acterised in that from 5 to 80 of the units linking the reactant residues in the polymer chain have the formula O , the remaining linkages between the residues of the reactants being of the formula O , optionally together with linkages of the formula , substantially all of said remaining linkages being disposed in coaxial or parallel and oppositely directed manner with respect to the residues to which they are linked, the polyester anhydride having a solubility of less than 5 by weight in dimethyl sulphoxide at room temperature.
