# QUARTERNARY AMINE CARBAMATE OR UREA COMPOUNDS BASED ON ISOPROPENYL , ALPHA, ALPHA DIMETHYLBENZYL ISOCYANATE

## Abstract
A meta or para compound of the formula Also disclosed is a method of making the compound by reacting meta or para isopropenyl α,α dimethylbenzyl isocyanate with either an amino alcohol or a dialkylamino ethyleneamine, and quaternizing the reaction product with an alkylating agent. The compound may be polymerized with a co monomer such as acrylamide to yield water soluble cationic polymers for use in water clarification, flocculation, and hair spray applications.
