## Description
This invention relates to semiconductor devices. More particularly, this invention relates to lead frames for mounting semiconductor chips that reduce the likelihood of bonding failures during fabrication of the devices. Lead frames for semiconductor devices typically comprise a tab for mounting a semiconductor chip and a plurality of inner leads extending inwardly from the perimeter of the frame to an area immediately adjacent to the perimeter of the tab. The tab is typically located within the body of the lead frame and is secured to the perimeter of the frame by at least one supporting member. During fabrication of a semiconductor device the tips of the inner leads are connected to electrodes on the semiconductor chip by means of fine metal wires, following which the chip, tab and inner leads are encapsulated within a synthetic resin, a ceramic material, or a combination of a glass and a ceramic material. Semiconductor devices that can be fabricated in this manner include various types of integrated circuits. Prior art lead frames suffer from a number of shortcomings. As the number of inner leads has been increased from 16 to 32 to 64, the width of these leads has usually been reduced. As the circumference of the lead frame is increased, the inner leads are correspondingly lengthened. These modifications have caused the inner leads to become weaker and easier to deform, to the extent that they can be bent by the vibrations experienced during transport of the lead frame. This problem has been further compounded by a reduction in lead frame thickness. A bent or dislocated inner lead increases the difficulty of bonding the lead to the fine bonding wire connecting the lead to an electrode on the semiconductor chip, resulting in more frequent bonding failures and undesirable contact been adjacent bonding wires and or inner leads. Solutions that have been proposed to remedy the aforementioned shortcomings include stabilizing the configuration of the inner leads by adhering at least a portion of the leads to a strip of pressure sensitive dielectric tape or adhering an edge of the mounting tab and the tips of at least some of the inner leads to a dielectric film adhered using a liquid adhesive. These solutions have been proposed in Japanese Patent Publications Kokai Nos. 58 83 161,439, 58 83 143,541 and 58 83 182,859. Use of a dielectric pressure sensitive tape to immobilize the inner leads is less than satisfactory because the pressure sensitive adhesive is softened by the high temperatures used in die bonding or wire bonding. The tape then slips or peels with the result that wire bonding to the leads is made difficult. Lead frames in which the inner leads and tab surface are bonded to an insulating film using a liquid adhesive are less than satisfactory. The adhesive can be squeezed out during the bonding operation, thereby contaminating the wire bond and complicating the production process. An objective of the present invention is to eliminate the problems associated with prior art lead frames by providing a lead frame for semiconductor devices in which the inner leads are immobilized, the wire bonding operation is simplified and failures to properly connect the semiconductor to the inner leads are infrequent. The objectives of this invention are achieved by providing a semiconductor device lead frame which comprises a mounting tab for a semiconductor chip located within the lead frame and multiple inner leads extending to the area adjacent to the perimeter of said tab, wherein the configuration of the inner leads with respect to one another and the mounting tab is stabilized using a heat resistant resin film which has been coated on one side with a cured heat activated silicone adhesive.

Figure 3 is a top view of a lead frame that represents another embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4 is a magnified view partial crossectional view along line II II of Figure 3. Figure 5 is a top view of a lead frame that represents a third embodiment of the present invention. This invention provides a lead frame for a semiconductor device comprising a mounting tab for a semiconductor chip located within the body of said frame, at least one supporting member extending from the body of said tab to the perimeter of said frame, a plurality of inner leads extending from the perimeter of said frame inwardly to the area immediately adjacent to the perimeter of said tab, and means for stabilizing the configuration of said inner leads with respect to one another and with respect to said tab during installation of said chip, said means consisting essentially of a heat resistant, dielectric film that is bonded to at least a portion of said inner leads or to the tips of said leads and said tab by a heat cured silicone adhesive. The shape, size, thickness and material of the present lead frames are not critical so long as multiple outer and inner leads extend inwardly from the perimeter of the frame to an area adjacent to the tab on which a semiconductor chip is to be mounted. However, lead frames made of metal, which are thin and which possess a large number of inner leads, and particularly long inner leads, are most suitable for the present invention. A heat resistant resin film laminated with a cured heat activated silicone adhesive serves as the medium to which at least a portion of the inner leads, and, optionally, the mounting tab are adhered to immobilize them. The type of film is not critical so long as it is a laminate, and preferably a unified laminate, of a cured, heat activated silicone adhesive applied to one surface of a heat resistant dielectric resin film. Suitable silicone materials include rubbers, gels and resins. Suitable dielectric films are exemplified by polyimide films, polyamide films, aromatic polyamide films and polyester films. The only requirement for the silicone material is that the cured material be capable of bonding to a substrate such as metal, ceramic or glass when heated in contact with these substrates. One class of useful silicone materials are principally composed of a vinyl containing polyorganosiloxane, a polyorganohydrogensiloxane, an adhesion promotor and a platinum compound catalyst. Examples of suitable adhesion promoters include vinyltrialkoxysilane, allyltrialkoxysilane, γ methacryloxy propyltrialkoxysilane, γ glycidoxypropyltrialkoxysilane, trialkoxysilane and vinyltri isopropenoxy silane. A second class of silicone materials are principally composed of a vinyl containing polyorganosiloxane, a polyorganohydrogensiloxane and a platinum compound catalyst. This latter class of materials contains a large excess of silicon bonded hydrogen relative to silicon bonded vinyl groups, and has been cured on the heat resistant dielectric resin film. The heat resistant dielectric resin film laminated with a cured heat activated silicone adhesive can be a tape applied in the shape of an L , a U , a rectangular frame, a square frame, a rectangular sheet or a square sheet. All of the inner leads can be adhered to a single strip or sheet of heat resistant dielectric resin film. Alternatively, all the inner leads are adhered, but as two or more groups using multiple pieces of dielectric film, or only the longer inner leads are adhered to the dielectric film. In an alternative embodiment the film may cover the tips of the inner leads and either the perimeter of the tab or the entire surface of the tab. The heat resistant resin film can be bonded to one side or to both sides of the inner leads. The following example describes preferred embodiments of this invention. The example should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention defined in the accompanying claims. All parts and percentages in the example are by weight. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows the design of a lead frame for semiconductor devices that represents one embodiment of the present invention. Rectangular tab All of the inner leads The heat activated silicone adhesive was prepared by blending together 97 parts of a dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated polydimethylsiloxane exhibiting a viscosity of 2 x 10 ³m² sec. at 25 C, 2.0 parts trimethyl terminated polymethylhydrogensiloxane with a viscosity of 1 x 10 ⁵m² sec. at 25 C, 0.001 part chloroplatinic acid and 3.0 parts vinyltrimethoxysilane. This composition was coated on one surface of polyimide film As depicted in Figure 2, the heat resistant dielectric resin film The problems associated with the prior art do not occur when semiconductor devices are assembled using the above described lead frame. Because the tips of inner leads Figure 3 depicts another embodiment of the present lead frame. A rectangular tab The tips of all inner leads The heat resistant resin film laminated with cured heat activated silicone adhesive As shown in Figure 4, the heat resistant resin film The problems described hereinabove for the prior art lead frames do not occur when devices are assembled using the lead frame of this invention depicted in Figure 3. Because the tips of inner leads Because a cured heat activated silicone adhesive is used as the adhesive medium, the wire bonding portion located at the tips of inner leads Figure 5 shows the design of the essential elements of a lead frame for semiconductor devices which represents yet another embodiment of the present invention. A rectangular tab The heat resistant resin film laminated with cured heat activated silicone adhesive The heat resistant resin film Because the tips of the longest of the inner leads Because a cured heat activated silicone adhesive was employed as the adhesive medium, the wire bonding parts at the tips of inner leads Because a heat resistant resin film laminated with a cured heat activated silicone adhesive is used to secure the inner leads to each other, or to secure the tips of the inner leads to the tab, the tips of the inner leads are stably maintained in place. As a result, wire bonding is easily conducted and bonding misses and bonding openings after bonding are prevented. Unlike previous liquid adhesives, said heat resistant resin film laminated with a cured heat activated silicone adhesive is not squeezed out and so does not contaminate the tip portion of the lead used for wire bonding. Unlike previous pressure sensitive adhesives, when said heat resistant resin film laminated with cured heat activated silicone adhesive is exposed to the elevated temperatures used for die bonding or wire bonding, the adhesive does not slip or loosen at the adhesion surface and so does not cause any shifting or bending of the inner lead. The present invention thereby significantly contributes to increasing the rate of production and reliability of semiconductor devices. The present lead frames are suitable for resin sealed, ceramic sealed and solder dipped semiconductor devices and particularly for semiconductor integrated circuit devices.
