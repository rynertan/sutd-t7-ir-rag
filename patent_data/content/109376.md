## Claims
CLAIMS. 1. Elements for lining the sides or the bed from waterways, dikes and similar hydraulic works, which are formed by base elements which have means 1, 2, 5 whereby they may be connected together with a possibility of hinging. 2. Elements as defined in claim 1, in which said means are formed by providing at least one indentation 2 along the one side of a base element, and at least one recess 1 along the opposite side of the same base element, as well as by a hinged connection between indentation 2 and recess 1 . 3. Elements as defined in claim 2, in which the base element is of rectangular shape and has a hinged connection between a recess and an indentation formed by a rod 5 which passes through an opening 4 in a recess and two openings 4 in the side walls of an indentation cooperating therewith. 4. Elements as defined in any one of claims 1 3, in which that side facing outwards of said recesses 1 is rounded at least along that surface which is the upper surface in operating condition, to make hinging of a base element relative to an adjacent base element easier. 5. Elements as defined in any one of claims 1 4, in which the base elements are bored through at right angle relative to the top or bottom surface thereof. 6. Elements as defined in any one of claims 1 5, in which a plurality of base elements which are provided sidewise with a plurality of indentations and a plurality of recesses, are joined together into a mat.

## Description
Elements for lining the sides or the bed from waterways, dikes and similar hydraulic works . This invention relates to elements for lining the sides or the bed from waterways, dikes and similar hydraulic works. The invention has for object to provide elements which are perfectly suitable to protect the sides or the bed from a waterway, a river mouth or a fairway against underwashing, undermining or another form of eroding. The invention has mainly for object to provide elements which are perfectly suitable for laying such a protection underwater. With the methods and systems used for a long time to secure underwater the bed of a waterway for example, use is made of quarry Sones or dumped stones, as well as of mats made from fascines which are loaded with stones and sunk in position. Synthetic material clothes weighed down with spiked or glued concrete blocks have also been used for the same purpose. The use of such materials is tedious, time consuming and thereby very expensive. The present invention has for object to obviate the drawbacks of the art as known up to now and to provide elements which may easily be arranged into a mat on location, ready to be located in the waterway or on the sides or banks thereof. For this purpose the elements are formed according to the invention, by base elements which have means whereby they may be connected together with a possibility of hinging. Still according to the invention said means are formed by providing at least one indenting along the one side of the base element, and at least one recess along the opposite side of the same base element as well as by a hinged connection between said indenting and recess. The base element is preferably of rectangular shape and the hinged connection between an indenting and a recess is formed by a rod which passes through an opening in a projection and two openings in the side walls of an indenting cooperating therewith. In a preferred embodiment, said base elements are bored through at right angle relative to the top and bottom surface thereof. Other details and features of the invention will stand out from the following description, given by way of non limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a top view of two base elements according to the invention and a rod for connecting said base elements. Figure 2 is a diagrammatic side view on the same scale, showing the connection in an angled position of two base elements. Figure 3 shows on a smaller scale , a ground mat formed from base elements according to the invention. Figure 4 depicts a method for locating on the bed and banks, a mat comprised of base elements according to the invention. In the various figures, the same reference numerals pertain to the seme elements. The base elements according to the invention are shown as rectangular elements. Such a rectangular shape is preferred and it is clear that the elements per se might show a true quadrangular shape. The base elements are provided sidewise with indentations 2 and recesses 1. The indentations 2 are somewhat smaller than the recesses 1, in such a way that the indentations may easily slide in the recesses 1 from an adjacent element. In the plate plane, between the upper and lower side, are provided recesses 3 which thus make the elements self draining. The recesses or openings 3 have such a size that no washing away of the background or underlying ground is to be feared. The recesses 1 have such a size and are so designed as to let the indentations 2 slide therein with the required play. In each indentation 2 is provided an opening 4 through which a rod 5 may be so slipped that two adjacent elements are hingedly connected together. As it appears from figure 2, the base elements have on that side thereof which may be considering in operating position, as the upper surface, a rounding 6 which may also be arranged on both sides in a particular embodiment. With such rounding the hinging together of two adjacent elements is enhanced. The elements as shown in the figures have a plurality of recesses and indentations.The size of the quadrangular or rectangular base elements will be determined according to local requirements. In principle a base element may thus have but one indentation which cooperates with one recess from an adjacent element. In actual practice however preference will be given to elements as shown in figures 1 and 3. When a plurality of elements are mutually connected as shown in the figures, there is formed a mat 7 figure 3 which, by means of a yoke 8 for example, connected for instance to a hoisting crane not shown, may be laid underwater on the sides of a waterway or flat on the bed thereof figure 4 . The size of said mat is only limited on the one hand by the mechanical properties of the material being considered, and on the other hand by the positioning possibilities. Notwithstanding the openings 3 specially provided against washing away and undermining in the base elements, some filter cloth may when desired be provided in combination with the abovedescribed mat. Such a cloth may beforehand be sunk in situ or be secured underneath the mat. Securing systems for such mats on the base elements are numerous. The mats may as well be prefabricated, that is obtained in the works from base elements connected together and supplied in such a form on site, as manufactured in situ from supplied loose base elements and rods. In such a way lengths fulfilling all requirements may be manufactured on site. The base element may be manufactured from concrete, synthetic materia . and wood or similar suitable materials, and it may be reinforced and or armoured or not. The mutual connection of the base elements and the positioning of the resulting mats are very simple and clearly bring very large advantages. It must be understood that the invention is in no way limited to the above embodiments and that many changes may be brought therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For instance, the elements according to the invention and the mats formed therewith may be used as well as propping in dry ground as in the water.
