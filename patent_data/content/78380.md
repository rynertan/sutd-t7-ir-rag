# Method of making electrical connections to thin film coatings and the electrical connector formed thereby.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of making electrical connections to thin film coatings and the electrical connector formed thereby especially useful in a fluid flowmeter. The film with its conductive coating is pressed against a rigid, relatively long, connector bar by conductively coated pads of elas tomeric material at a selected controlled pressure with the electrical connections to the film coating being made through the bar and pads. Utilizing this method, localized high stress areas which cause damage to the thin film are avoided, and low current densities are accomplished by the controlled contact pressure over a large area of the film coating.
