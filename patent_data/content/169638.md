# RASTER IMAGE MANIPULATOR

## Abstract
A raster image manipulator includes source and destina tion image data stores 62 and 72 respectively 1024 1024 and 512 512 pixels in extent. A clock 74 and counter 73 are employed to increment in unit steps the destination store address at which image data from the source store 62 is to be stored. Source store addresses from which image data are obtained are calculated from precomputed shift para meters by adders 50,51 arranged for cumulative addition. The shift parameters are fractional increments in source store address corresponding to unit increments in destina tion store address. After designating an initial source memory address, image manipulation consists of incremen tation of the destination store address in unit steps with corresponding incrementation of the source store address in shift parameter steps. The invention is capable of applying rotation, shift and X and Y magnification to image data in the source store 62 .
