# Resilient inner sole for a shoe.

## Abstract
A resilient inner sole 20 for a shoe is integrally formed from resilient material into a generally flat sheet member. The sheet member has a flat under surface 21 with a plurality of openings 23a,24a,25a which are upwardly enlarged to form air pockets 23b,24b,25b and the resilient material of the member extends over and thereby encloses the upper sides of the air pockets. When an impact is received upon an upper surface of the member, the member compresses, and air flows from the air pockets outward through the associated openings.
