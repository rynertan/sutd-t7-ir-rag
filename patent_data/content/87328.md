# Process to produce low hydrogen steel by argon oxygen decarburization.

## Abstract
A process to produce low hydrogen steel by oxygen decarburization. The vessel containing the steel melt is dried, as well as the cooling gas to the tuyere. All slag forming additions to the melt, their fluxing and the alloying additions to the melt are completed prior to the start of the decarbur ization. The flow rate of the gas mixture of oxygen and dilution gas during the decarburation step is sufficient, and sparging gas is injected during the finishing steps at a rate of at least 2.8 mÂ³. per ton of metal. To generate and maintain off gas flow preventing air from infiltrating into the vessel. By this technique a steel having a hydrogen content below 2 ppm may be obtained.
