# Vehicle lifting and towing apparatus.

## Abstract
A vehicle lifting and towing apparatus is adapted to be mounted beneath the floor at the rear portion of a vehicle. The lifting frame is incorporated in the intermediate portion 12 of a divided rear bumper and is pivotally mounted on plates 20 attached to the rear of the vehicle main frame members 22 . A sub frame 42 is mounted longitudinally slidable beneath the main frame members 22 and pivotally connects to the lift ing frame at a point spaced below the axis on which the lifting frame is mounted. Rearward movement of the sub frame 42 by means of hydraulic actuators 48 causes the lifting frame to pivot upwards into an operative position. The sub frame members 44 are shaped to transfer load from the sub frame 42 via a plate 72 to the rear axle of the towing vehicle when the sub frame 42 is in a rearward position.
