# Barium ferrite particles for magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
Plate like barium ferrite particles which have a BET specific surface area of 20 to 70 m² g, an average particle diameter of 0.05 to 0.3 µm, a magnetization of higher than 30 emu g in a field of 7.96 10⁵ A m ¹ 10 kOe and a coercive force of 2.39 10⁴ to 7.96 10⁴ A m ¹ 300 to 1,000 Oe and which are represented by the formula BaCo
