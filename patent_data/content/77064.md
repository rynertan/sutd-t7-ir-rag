## Abstract
A photographic element for color diffusion transfer photography is described wherein a polymeric vehicle layer is employed in a metallizable dye image receiving layer, a layer adjacent thereto, or in both. The polymeric vehicle comprises a cross linked polymer derived from recurring units of an acrylamide, a 1 vinyl 2 pyrrolidone or a 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate with a cross linkable mono mer.
