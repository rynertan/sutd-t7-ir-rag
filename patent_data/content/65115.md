# Alignment apparatus for X ray or optical lithography.

## Abstract
Fine alignment of mask 12 and wafer 13 , using Fresnel zone plates is achieved by focussing light on the wafer using a zone plate in the mask. Light diffracted from a zone plate on the wafer is received by a sensor 14 . The received light is coded analog or digital to indicate alignment. For analog coding the wafer zone plate diffracts light to the sensor from an area of the wafer zone plate which is indicative of alignment. For digital coding the wafer plate is digitally encoded as a function of alignment to similarly code the diffracted light.
