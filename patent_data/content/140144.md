# MODIFIED PIPERIDINES AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT STABILIZERS MODIFIED PIPERIDINES AS ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT STABILIZERS

## Abstract
A composition of matter contains as a principal compo nent a material which acts as an ultraviolet light stabilizer. The ultraviolet light stabilizer is formed from the reaction of a a methylol or alkoxy alkyl containing material, and b an alkyl substituted piperidine containing material having at least one group selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl, amido, and ureido.
