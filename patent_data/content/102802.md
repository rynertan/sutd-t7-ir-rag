# Photolithographic process for fabricating thin film transistors.

## Abstract
A photolithographic method for fabricating thin film transistors and thin film transistor arrays in which the contamination vulnerable semi conductor insulator inter faces are formed in a single vacuum pump down operation. To minimize step coverage problems, quasi planar construc tion is employed to provide a planar substructure for receipt of the deposited thin semiconductor layer.
