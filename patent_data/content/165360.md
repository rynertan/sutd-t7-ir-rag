# Device and method for centrifugally casting articles.

## Abstract
A device and method for spin casting articles such as lenses employing a polymerization tube 2 in conjunction with a plurality of molds 8 such that the tube 2 is adapted to accommodate the plurality of molds 8 in an interference fitting and sliding relationship so that rotation of the polymerization tube 2 will cause the molds 8 to rotate at the same speed while maintaining the concentricity of the molds 8 to the spinning axis of the tube 2 to produce quality spun cast articles.
