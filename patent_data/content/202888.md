# Process for selectively removing sodium cations from a solution containing sodium and ammonium cations.

## Abstract
A process is provided for selectively removing sodium ions from a solution containing sodium and ammonium ions using a polysulfonated aromatic cation exchange resin. The polysulfonated resin exhibits enhanced selectivity for sodium ions over ammonium ions when compared with convention al, monosulfonated cation exchange resin. This enhanced selectivity results in a lower concentration of sodium ion leakage and longer bed life to critical leakage, compared with conventional, monosulfonated resins.

## Description
PROCESS FOR SELECTIVELY REMOVING SODIUM CATIONS FROM ASOLUTION CONTAINING SODIUM AND AMMONIUM CATIONS. This invention is concerned with the selective removal of sodium cations from solutions containing sodium and ammonium cations, for example from steam generator condensate, and especially with a process for condensate polishing using polysulfonated, strong acid, cation exchange resins operated in an ammonia cycle. Condensate polishing is a specialized application for ion exchange resins, in which these resins are used to treat the water from which steam is generated to drive steam turbines. Commonly, the generating system is a closed cycle, in which the steam is condensed, polished by passing it through the ion exchange bed, and vaporized again to operate the turbine. Purity requirements for such waters are stringent, and levels, for example, above a few parts per billion ppb 1 x 10 9 g g sodium ion are considered unacceptable. The condensate polishing bed of ion exchange resin is intended to maintain the undesirable impurities below levels such as these, especially in the event of a leak in the condenser cooling system, which might permit raw cooling water to enter the closed, high purity, steam generating system.Such leaks can introduce ionic impurities into the system at levels typically on the order of a few hundred ppb. In addition, the cation exchange resin of the condensate polisher must control the level of sodium introduced during regeneration of the ion exchange resins. During the separation that precedes regeneration of mixed bed condensate polishers, a small amount of the cation exchange resin is unavoidably entrained with the anion exchange resin, and is exhausted with sodium during the anion exchange regeneration with sodium hydroxide. Some of this sodium will leak into the condensate, and must also be controlled to the requisite level. The reason for these stringent requirements for water purity is to protect the system, especially the turbine, from corrosion. For this reason ammonia is also added to the steam generator feed water, to adjust the system to a slightly alkaline pfl. The levels of ammonia used are quite low, typically from a few hundred to a few thousand ppb ammonium ion. The cation exchange resin in the ion exchange resin bed is thus presented with a difficult task it must allow the few thousand ppb ammonia to remain in the condensate, but must remove any excess metal ions down to the required purity level. Cation exchange resins which heretofore have typically been used in this application operate initially in the hydrogen cycle . That is, upon regeneration, the cation exchange resin is in the hydrogen ion form, and upon exposure to ammonium ions in the condensate water, it will exchange the hydrogen ions for the ammonium ions, lowering the concentration of ammonium ions and lowering the pH of the condensate water. As ammonia continues to be added to the condensate, all of the hydrogen form cation exchange resin will be converted to the ammonium form, and the ammonium ion begins to break through the bed at approximately the input concentration, signaling the beginning of the ammonia cycle operation. Sodium ions are commonly present in the condensate system most often these are introduced during regeneration of the resin bed, when a small amount of the cation exchange resin is carried into the anion exchange resin regeneration vessel and exposed to the sodium hydroxide regenerant. Additional sodium may be present from water leaks or other sources. The cation exchange resins which have been used in the past for condensate polishing leak relatively little sodium during the hydrogen cycle, and little difficulty is met keeping the sodium concentration below the required limit. At the establishment of the ammonia cycle, however, the concentration of sodium ions in the condensate, i.e., the sodium leakage, is no longer controlled by the sodium hydrogen equilibrium, which strongly favors adsorption of sodium.The controlling equilibrium becomes the sodium ammonium equilibrium, which favors adsorption of ammonium ions about equally with sodium ions. The sodium ion leakage will continue to be low in absolute terms, but it will sharply increase over the leakage observed during the hydrogen cycle, and this increase is often enough to exceed the sodium ion leakage specification for the condensate system. Applicants have now found that a certain class of cation exchange resins possesses a more favourable sodium ammonium selectivity than the previously used cation exchange resins, and that this favourable selectivity can be used to advantage in a process for selectively removing sodium cations from a solution containing sodium and ammonium cations. For example, condensate polishing resin beds may be operated during the ammonia cycle to produce polished condensate of superior quality, in that it contains exceptionally low levels of sodium ions compared to those previously achievable. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for selectively removing sodium cations from a solution containing sodium and ammonium cations, which comprises contacting the solution with polysulfonated aromatic cation exchange resin containing sulfonate and or sulfone groups in such an amount as to give a microanalytical value for sulfur at least 1.04 times that which would be given by sulfur introduced into the same copolymer by conventional sulfonation with sulfuric acid. Polysulfonated aromatic cation exchange resins show an unexpected affinity for sodium ions in preference to ammonium ions at the concentration levels encountered in condensate polishing. The selectivity coeficient KNa for such resins is typically about NH4 Na 2.8, compared to the K of typically 1.0 or less NH4 for conventional cation exchange resins used for condensate polishing applications. The resins operable in the present invention are conveniently those prepared by polysulfonation from crosslinked aromatic copolymers, including both gel and macroporous copolymers. The preferred copolymers are macroporous, styrenic copolymers. As used herein, macroporous copolymers include macroreticular copolymers prepared by suspension polymerization in the presence of a phase extending agent, as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,256,840 and 4,224,415, and copolymers into which large pores have been introduced by other means, for example, by the technique described in U.S. Patent No. 3,122,514. The resins prepared from macroporous copolymers are called macroporous resins. Polysulfonation, as used herein, is such as would result from a sulfonation process that is sufficiently vigorous to introduce an average of more than one sulfonate group per aromatic nucleus that is available to be sulfonated. Such vigorous sulfonation is accompanied by the formation of a significant number of sulfone crosslinks, in which sulfonate groups bridge between two aromatic nuclei to form S02 crosslinks.Thus, while polysulfonation may produce a resin with strong acid ion exchange capacity greater than that of a fully monosulfonated resin, this is not necessarily so. As the polysulfonation produces both sulfonate and sulfone groups, analytical identification of the polysulfonated resin is best done by conventional microanalytical procedures for elemental sulfur content. A polysulfonated resin, as used herein, is one in which the microanalytical value for sulfur in the resin molecular structure is at least 1.04 times, preferably at least 1.07 times, and more preferably at least 1.16 times, the value for the sulfur which would be introduced by conventional, sulfuric acid sulfonation of the same copolymer. In general, conventional, sulfuric acid sulfonation of lightly cross linked copolymers will introduce approximately the same amount of sulfur as would theoretically be expected for complete monosulfonation of the copolymer. In highly crosslinked copolymers, however, sulfonation tends to occur predominantly at or near the surface of the copolymer particle, and to a lesser extent at increasing distances from the surface. Polysulfonation exhibits a similar phenomenon a highly cross linked, polysulfonated copolymer may contain less sulfur than theoretically expected for monosulfonation, yet the accessible aromatic nuclei will be polysulfonated. The process of the present invention, when used to treat steam generator condensate, conveniently comprises passing steam condensate containing ammonium ions and sodium ions through a bed of polysulfonated, aromatic cation exchange resin, preferably until the ammonia cycle has been established, and thereafter preferentially exchanging sodium ions from the solution for ammonium ions fixed at the exchange sites on the resin, until the sodium ions on the resin approach equilibrium with the sodium ions in the solution.Approach to resin equilibrium with sodium ions, as used herein, is indicated by a rise in sodium leakage through the resin bed, or an increase in the rate at which the sodium leakage rises, over the relatively low leakage or slow increase in leakage at the start of the ammonia cycle. In practical terms exchange continues until the rising sodium leakage, caused by the approach to sodium resin equilibrium, reaches a preselected value higher than the initial sodium leakage at the start of the ammonia cycle. This value of sodium leakage is usually chosen to be equal to the maximum permissible sodium level for the system. The actual operating conditions may be varied to vary the useful life of the resin in the ammonia cycle, that is, the operating time between the start of the ammonia cycle and the saturation with sodium ions.Among the conditions affecting the useful life of the resin in the ammonia cycle are the volume of resin in the bed, the flow of condensate, the concentration of sodium ions entering the bed, and the concentration of ammonium ions in the condensate the relationship of these parameters is described below. The present invention will now be further illustrated by way of the following example which is for illustrative purposes only and is not to be construed as imposing any linitation on the scope of the invention. All percentages are by weiqht unless otherwise indicated, and all reaqents used are of good commercial quality.EXAMPLE This Example illustrates one embodiment of the process of the present invention and compares the results of this process with results of the prior art process using conventional, monosulfonated ion exchange resin. Conditions for the Example were selected to simulate typical ammonia cycle condensate polishing conditions. Available cation exchange sites on the resin were loaded 99 with ammonium ions and 1 with sodium ions, simulating the condition of a resin which has freshly begun the ammonia cycle. The concentration of ammonium ion was 1882 ppb, calculated as CaCO3, producing a simulated condensate having a pH of 9.6.This level closely approximates the 2000 ppb ammonium ion, calculated as CaCO3, typically found in ammonia cycle condensate. The level of sodium ion leakage from the sodium form resin was measured in the liquid phase using a specific ion electrode. These values may be used to determine the Na selectivity coefficient K which defines the No4 following equilibrium KR NH4 Na EMI7.1 R Na NH4 The selectivity coefficient may be calculated from the following equation EMI8.1 wherein R Na and P NH4 are measured in milliequivalents per gram of resin, and NH4 and Na are measured in milliequivalents per liter of solution.The R refers to the sulfonated styrene DVB copolymer which serves as the substrate for the fixed ionic charge. As the selectivity coefficient is often highly dependent on R Na and on No4 , it is necessary to closely approximate actual end use conditions in order to make useful predictions for high purity water applications such as condensate polishing. In the present example, both a conventional, monosulfonated cation exchange resin Amberlite 200 ion exchange resin and a polysulfonated styrenic cation exchange resin operable in the process of the present invention were tested according to the following procedure. A 90 ml sample of each resin, in the hydrogen form, was converted to the ammonium form using 0.2 ammonium hydroxide. To each 90 ml sample was added 1 ml of the same resin in the sodium form, and each sample was mixed thoroughly. Into 2.54 cm l inch internal diameter ID , glass columns were measured 9 ml of each resin in the hydrogen form, and the mixed samples of each resin in the ammonium sodium form each mixed resin sample was allowed to rest on top of the corresponding hydrogen form resin without mixing. The contents of each column were rinsed with high purity 17.2 megohm water at 200 ml min until a constant electrical resistance for the effluent was obtained.Water containing the amounts of ammonium hydroxide indicated in Table 1 was passed through each column at 200 ml min, to simulate the ammonia cycle, until a constant level of sodium ion leakage was observed, at which time the final resistance of the effluent water and the pH of the feed water was measured and recorded. Table 1 shows the amount of ammonia and sodium ion leakage, calculated for the ionized materials as calcium carbonate, for sodium as the sodium ion, and for ammonia as total NH3, at the beginning and end of the ammonia cycle. The Table also shows the concentration of resin in the sodium form, and the value of Na K NH4 as described above, at the beginning and end of the ammonia cycle.
