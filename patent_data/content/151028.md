# Vehicle braking system.

## Abstract
A vehicle braking system is disclosed. The system is of the type including a pneumatic booster 1 which includes a shell casing 2, 3 , a flexible diaphragm 5 , a power piston 4 connected to the diaphragm to a define a constant pressure chamber A and a variable pressure chamber B in the shell casing, an input shaft 33 , a valve mechanism 35 37 provided in the power piston and associated with the input shaft to control the pressure in the variable pressure cham ber, an output shaft 22 receiving the output force from the power piston, and a reaction mechanism 21 for transmitting reaction force of the output shaft to the input shaft. The boos ter further comprises a control chamber 11 , and a control piston 13 partitioning the interior of the control chamber into a second constant pressure chamber C and a second variable pressure chamber D . The pressure in the second variable pressure chamber D is controlled by a control mechanism in response to a predetermined operational con dition of the vehicle, and the control piston 13 is associated with the input shaft such that the control piston applies a force on the input shaft in the brake applying direction when the control piston is displaced.
