## Description
NOVEL POLYETHERIMIDE COPOLYMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new class of polyetherimide copolymers. More specifically, the polyetherimide copolymers contain two distinct types of polymeric units. These copolymers are characterized by excellent thermal and physical properties. It is known that polyetherimides can be produced by the reaction of an aromatic bis ether anhydride and an organic aromatic diamine. It is also known that polyetherimides can be produced by the reaction of an aromatic bis ether anhydride and an organic aliphatic diamine. Each of these two types of polymers have certain advantages. Polyetherimides prepared from aromatic diamines have excellent thermal stability and high glass transition temperatures. Polyetherimides prepared from aliphatic diamines are characterized by particularly good flexural properties. There is a need for a polymer which has the thermal properties of polyetherimides prepared from aromatic diamines and the physical properties of polyetherimides prepared from aliphatic diamines. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, novel polyetherimide copolymers contain repeating units of the frri j1as EMI2.1 where Z is a member of the class consisting of 1 EMI2.2 and 2 divalent organic radicals of the general formula EMI3.1 where X is a member selected from the class consisting of divalent radicals of the formulas, ICyH2y r EMI3.2 0 and Swhere q is O or 1, y is a whole number from 1 to 5, the divalent bonds of the O Z O radical being situated on the phthalic anhydride end groups, in the 3,3 , 3,4 , 4,3 or the 4,4 positions, and R is a divalent organic radical selected from the class consisting of a aromatic hydrocarbon radicals having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms and halogenated derivatives thereof and b divalent radicals included by the formula EMI3.3 where Q is a member selected from the class consisting of 0 , C , EMI3.4 S , and CxH2, r where x is a whole number from 1 to about.5 inclusive, and R is a divalent organic radical selected from the class consisting of a alkylene radicals having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, and b C 2 8 alkylene terminated polydiorganosiloxane. The polyetherimide copolymers of the present invention exhibit a broad spectrum of glass transition temperatures which will allow one to specifically tailor a resin to its end use. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The polyetherimides containing the repeating units of Formulas I and II can be obtained by the reaction of any aromatic bis ether anhydride of the formula EMI4.1 where Z is as defined hereinbefore with an aromatic diamine of the formula H2N R NH2 IV.and an aliphatic diamine of the formula H2N R NH2 V.where R and R are as defined hereinbefore. The unit ofFormula I is the reaction product of an aromatic bis ether anhydride and the organic aromatic diamine ofFormula IV. The unit of Formula II is the reaction product of an aromatic bis ether anhydride and the organic aliphatic diamine of Formula V.In general, the reaction can be advantageously carried out employing well known solvents, e.g., o dichlorobenzene, m cresol toluene, etc., in which to effect interaction between the dianhydrides and the diamines, at temperatures of from about 100 C to about 250 C. Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any dianhydride of Formula III with any aromatic diamine ofFormula rv and any aliphatic diamine of Formula V while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200it to 400 C and preferably 2300C to 3000C can be employed.Any order of addition of chain stoppers ordinarily employed in melt polymerizations can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mole percent of the diamine compounds can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups.Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides of Formula I or Formula II are those disclosed in U.S. Patents to Heath et al.3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al.3,850,885, White 3,352,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suited to the practice of this invention. The aromatic bis ether anhydride s of Formula III include, for example, 2 ,2 bis 4 2 ,3 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride 4,4 bis 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl ether dianhydride 1,3 bis 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy benzene dianhydride 4,4 bis 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl sulfide dianhydride 1,4 bis 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy benzene dianhydride 4,4 bis 2 ,3 dicarboxyphenoxy benzophenone dianhydride 4,4 bis 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl sulfone dianhydride 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride 4,4 bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl ether dianhydride 4,4 bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl sulfide dianhydride l,3 bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy benzene dianhydride 1,4 bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy benzene dianhydride 4,4 bis 3 ,4 dicarboxyphenoxy benzophenone dianhydride 4 2,3 dicarboxyphenoxy 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl 2,2 propane dianhydride etc. and mixtures of such dianhydrides. In addition, aromatic bis ether anhydride s also included by Formula III are shown by Koton, M.M. Plorinski, F.S. Bessonov, M.I. Rudakov, A.P. Institute of Heteroorganic Compounds, Academy of Sciences, U.S.S.R. , U.S.S.R. 257,010, Nov. 11, 1969, Appl. May 3, 1967. In addition, dianhydrides are shown by M.M. Koton,F.S. Florinski, Zh. Org. Khin., 4 5 , 774 1968 . The aromatic diamines of Formula IV include, for example, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,41 diaminodiphenylmethane, benzidine, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5 diaminonaphthalene, 3,3 dimethylbenzidine, 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine, 2,4 bis 0 amino t butyl toluene, bis p ss amino t butylphenyl ether, bis p j3 1 methyl o aminopentyl benzene, 1,3 diamino 4 isopropylbenzene, m xylylenediamine, p xylylenediamine, 2,4 diaminotoluene, 2,6 diaminotoluene, and mixtures of such aromatic diamines. The aliphatic diamines of Formula V include, for example, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 2,11 dodecanediamine, 2,2 dimethylpropylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 3 methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2 ,5 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 5 methylnonamethylenediamine, 1,12 octadecanediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl sulfide, N methyl bis 3 aminopropyl amine, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane, bis 4 aminobutyl tetramethyldisiloxane, etc., and mixtures of such aliphatic diamines. In producing the polyetherimide of the present invention both an aromatic diamine and an aliphatic diamine are utilized. The relative proportions of the repeating units of Formulas I and II can vary, depending on the end use of the polyetherimide to be produced. The repeating units of Formula I can be from about 5 to about 95 mole percent of the copolymer with the balance being the repeating units of Formula II, i.e., from about 95 to about 5 mole percent. Preferred copolymers are those in which the repeating units of Formula I are from about 90 to about 10 mole percent of the copolymer. By varying the amount of particular aromatic diamine or particular aliphatic diamine, one will vary the mole percent of the corresponding polymeric unit to the overall copolymer.In particularly preferred copolymers the repeating unit of Formula I is from about 20 to about 80 mole percent of the total copolymer formed, with the balance being made up of the repeating unit of Formula II. The present invention provides polymers having desi zzle glass transition temperatures while maintaining desirable flexibility and tensile properties. The glass transition temperatures are suitable for many applications, particularly injection molding applications. The polyetherimide copolymer can contain a wide variety of proportions of repeating units of Formula I and II. By controlling the proportions of the polymeric units each having predetermined properties, a polyetherimide can be formed having superiority over a polyetherimide containing only one of the repeating units. In general, the higher proportion of the repeating units ofFormula I will result in a polyetherimide having high glass transition temperatures and low flexibility. On the other hand, a polyetherimide having a higher propor tion of the repeating units of Formula II will have lower glass transition temperatures and high flexibility.
