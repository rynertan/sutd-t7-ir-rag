# Low silver containing dental amalgam alloys.

## Abstract
Conventional or non conventional dental amalgam alloys in the form of lathe cut, spherical shaped or irregular shaped particles of silver, tin, copper and zinc are improved by adding to the alloys at least one compound selected from Cu₆Sn₅, Cu₃Sn or a mixture thereof. The resulting dental alloy mixture is low in silver, is corrosion resistant, and is used as a filling for dental cavities after amalgamation with mercury.
