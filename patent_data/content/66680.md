# Systematic error correction in bar code scanner.

## Abstract
A technique for compensating for systematic errors in printing or reading bar codes is disclosed. Label decoding always begins with a center character 32 and proceeds one character at a time toward a margin. When bar space pair measurements indicate an ambiguous character which can only be fully decoded using bar width measurements error correction is based on the charac teristics of the adjacent, previously decoded character.
