# Spectral radiation sources of the hollow cathode type.

## Abstract
A hollow cathode type light source is provided having improved operating stability by forming the cathode of an alloy of a highly reactive, unstable prime metal of interest for spectral emission, and of a chemically stable, readily sputtered metal. An alloy of silver and calcium with a small amount of magnesium provides a hollow cathode device which exhibits stable operation after a minimum warm up time.
