# Controlled absorption pharmaceutical formulation.

## Abstract
A controlled absorption methyldopa formulation for oral administration comprises a pellet having a core of methyl dopa or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in associa tion with an organic acid, and an outer membrane which permits release of methyldopa in an aqueous medium at a controlled rate which is substantially pH independent. The pellet has a dissolution rate in vitro, which when measured in a Basket Assembly according to U.S. Pharmacopoeia XX at 37 C and 75 r.p.m., is not more than 50 of the total methyl dopa after one hour of measurement. Not more than 80 of the total methyldopa is released after a total of 3 hours of measurement and 100 release is achieved after a total of 7 hours.
