# ELECTRICAL APPARATUS

## Abstract
Mounting posts 66 are utilized to retain a printed wiring board 65 beneath a chassis 11 where the chassis supports a plurality of electrical and mechanical components 12, 14, 20, 21, 31, 32 . The mounting posts 66 pass through holes 44, 45 67, 68 in the chassis and the printed wiring board, and allow for a generally parallel relationship between the printed wiring board and the chassis. The design of the mounting posts and the holes allows for lateral movement of the printed wiring board to provide for a stress free align ment of the printed wiring board and electrical connection means 50 56 extending from the components on the chassis. The design of the mounting posts also allows for an electrically insulating material which can withstand the high temperatures of a wave soldering process.
