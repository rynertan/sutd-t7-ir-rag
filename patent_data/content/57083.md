# Power converter.

## Abstract
A switching power converter comprises a DC power source 1 , a switching element 2 and a transformer 3 interconnected so that the DC power source supplies power to the primary winding 3a of the transformer 3 through the switching element. A rectifier 4, 5 and an output filter circuit 6, 7 are connected to the secondary winding 3b of the transformer 3 . A parallel circuit comprising a capacitor 12 and a coil 13 is inserted in the current path of the primary winding. A control circuit 14 controls the ON and or OFF states of the switching element so that the switching element is turned to the ON state when the current in the coil 13 reaches a predetermined value which depends upon the output power of the power converter, and the switching element is turned to the OFF state after the current in the switching element reaches zero. Since the current in the switching element is zero when the switching element is turned to the OFF state, no power loss occurs in the OFF transition, and the conversion efficiency is thereby im proved.
