# Precool subcool thermal transfer system and method, and condenser therefor.

## Abstract
To increase the thermal efficiency of the heat pump system a precooler post heater heat exchanger 24 and a subcooler heat exchanger 26 are connected in fluid communication with the refrigerant input and output, respectively, of the condenser 16 evaporator 60 of a heat transfer system 12. A fluid, such as water, is forced through the subcooler heat exchanger 26 and then through the precooler post heater heat exchanger 24 to be in a heat exchanging relationship with the refrigerant flowing therethrough. The flow rate of the water flowing through the apparatus may be regulated so that the refrigerant is precooled to approximately its saturated vapor state and subcooled when the system 12 is operating in a cooling mode and such that the refrigerant is post heated to at least a saturated vapor state and subcooled when the system 12 is operating in a heating mode.
