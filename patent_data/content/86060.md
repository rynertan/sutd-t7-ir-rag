# Shipping and installation strap for linear actuator.

## Abstract
A disposable rupturable shipping and installation strap 30, 130 holding in a retracted position the output member 22, 122 of a linear actuator 14, 114 such as a pre filled hydraulic actuator 14, 114 . The strap has a retaining member 54, 70, 94, 138 fitted over the end of the actuator output member and a pair of symmetrically disposed strips or bands 48, 50, 72, 148, 182 integrally formed with the retaining member and attached at their other end to a portion of the actuator housing 14, 114 . The strips or bands have portions of reduced strength 58, 158 which cause the strap to break and free the actuator output member upon first operation of the actuator. Preferably the strap is molded of relatively thin flexible plastic. The retaining member is preferably in the form of a cylindrical cap 94, 138 installed on the end of the actuator output rod and having a substantially hemispherical end portion 166 engaged in a corresponding partially spherical concave recess 139 in the member operated by the actuator, such as a motor vehicle clutch release lever 128 . The cyclindrical cap is optionally provided with a radially extending disc like flange seal 190 resiliently engaged with the surface of the clutch actuating lever beyond the edge of the recess, such as to prevent introduction of dirt in the recess.
