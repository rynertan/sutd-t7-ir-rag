# EXHAUST SYSTEM

## Abstract
A reverse type silencer 10 comprises a pair of cylindrical portions 12, 14 in which their meeting ends are pinched and overlapped. A resonance silencer 12 is located behind the silencer 10 and has a plurality of notches 24 arranged spiral ly. Shells 26, 30 are provided for the silencer. Sound waves entering into the silencer are reflected and attenuated resulting in dampening of noise before emission.
