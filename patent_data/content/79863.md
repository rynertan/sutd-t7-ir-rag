# COOLING RADIATOR FOR MOTOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A cooling radiator for motor vehicles, of the type having at least one reversal in the direction of flow of the coolant liquid, comprises at least one manifold 2 provided with at least one partition 6 which divides the manifold into two chambers 8, 7 , arranged one downstream of the other. The radiator includes one way valve means 15 for controlling an aperture 22 in the partition 6 , which allow the coolant to flow towards the downstream chamber through the aperture 22 when the pressure difference between the two chambers 7, 8 exceeds a predetermined value.
