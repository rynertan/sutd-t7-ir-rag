# Novel pigment grinding vehicle.

## Abstract
A novel quaternary ammonium group containing mate rial which is obtained from reacting a monoepoxide with an amine containing at least one organic group containing an acyclic moiety of from about 8 to 30 carbon atoms is disclosed. The quaternary ammonium group containing materials are useful as pigment grinding vehicles and in the formulation of pigment paste, particularly pigment paste with high pigment loadings. When formulated in cationic electrodepositable compositions, the pigment grinding ve hicles provide for cured electrodeposited coatings of ex cellent corrosion resistance, particularly over untreated and oily steel.
