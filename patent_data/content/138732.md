# A process for the reductive alkylation of aromatic nitro containing compounds with ketones or aldehydes.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for the reductive alkylation of aromatic nitro containing compounds with ketones or al dehydes wherein the improvement is characterized in that a specific polymer bound co catalyst system is utilized. More specifically, a polymer bound anthranilic acid palladium complex is used in conjunction with a bound sulfonic acid resin as a catalyst system in a reaction to produce com pounds such as N phenyl N alkyl p phenylenediamine.
