# Electrical wiring distribution system.

## Abstract
A wiring distribution system for fill on slab or fill on grade floor constructions, including an uninterrupted main unit providing main passageways and at least one laterally extending feeder unit providing feeder passageways supported on a substructure slab or grade . A housing having a removable cover encloses a full width segment of the main unit and an end segment of the feeder unit. A covering layer of concrete fill surrounds the housing. A partition divides the interior of the enclosure into two compartments, a first communicating with one feeder passageway and a second communicating with the other feeder passageways. The main unit presents at least one common lengthwise trough extending through and beyond the opposite sides of the enclosure. First and second capping means enclose those portions of the common lengthwise trough on opposite sides of the enclosure to provide substantially unobstructed additional main passageways communicating with the second compartment. Isolator means within the housing isolates the first compartment from the common lengthwise trough. The arrangement is such that high voltage wiring extending through a designated main passageway may be fed through the first compartment to a corresponding feeder passageway whereas low voltage wiring, such as telephone and signal wiring, extending through others of the main passageways may be fed through the second compartment to corresponding feeder passageways.
