# APPARATUS FOR STRETCHING AND LINKING A VERTICAL BLIND SLAT CLOTH

## Abstract
A weight case 10 of a synthetic resin material contains a weight 20 of a metallic plate together with the bottom part 81 of a slat cloth 80 and includes as one body a top guide 30 for guiding the slat cloth to turn about and let in the weight case, a pair of L shaped legs 40 for preventing the slat cloth from being dragged on the floor, and a pair of T shaped pins for coupling engagement with couplers secured to a knitted linking cord 70 . Each coupler has a C shaped gripper 61 for removably fitting engagement with the T shaped pin and a W shaped hook 62 for removably hitching engagement with one of serially knitted eyelets 71 in the linking cord. The C shaped gripper is advantageously separable from the T shaped pin to protect the linking elements against damage when the cord is accidentally trodden or forcibly drawn in use.
