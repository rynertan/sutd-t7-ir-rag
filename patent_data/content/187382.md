## Description
This invention relates to a novel plasmid, a method for the construction of the plasmid, a novel microorganism containing the plasmid, and a method for the cultivation of the microorganism. More particularly it relates to a novel plasmid with a DNA sequence coding for the production and extracellular secretion of such high molecular substances as xylanase or penicillinase, a novel microorganism transformed with the plasmid, and a method for the production and secretion of such high molecular substances by culturing the microorganism. A plasmid is a non chromosomal gene of cyclic DNA found in a microorganism cell. Plasmids are currently being used as means for recombination of microorganism genes and are becoming more and more important in the fermentation industry. Studies have recently been done on plasmids carrying foreign DNA having genetic information of metabolic products or specific demand for growth of microorganism, as shown in the production of amino acids or peptides. Some plasmids have been introduced into host microorganisms to obtain transformants. Methods have been proposed for producing relatively low molecular compounds such as amino acids and peptides by culturing the transformants. However, the degree of propagation of plasmids carrying genes for production of high molecular substances depends on the nature of the host microorganisms and these plasmids have not effectively been expressed. Furthermore, no effective methods for cultivation of such transformants have been established. It has not been possible to obtain a certain extracellular high molecular product by culturing a microorganism transformed with a plasmid carrying a foreign DNA fragment having genetic information of extracellular secretion of high molecular substances which are metabolic products of another microorganism. Such extracellular secretion has not been successful even using a transformant of USP4,411,994 of W.Gilbert et al. discloses a process for producing specific proteins in bacteria and having them excreted from the bacterial cell. This process comprises inserting the DNA representing the desired non bacterial protein or part of a protein by recombinant techniques into a plasmid or phage gene for either a periplasmic or an extracellular protein, hereinafter called a carrier protein , transforming a bacterial host with the recombinant gene, and culturing the transformed host to excrete the protein. The process of this patent provides a means for producing a selected protein by employing a gene for a carrier protein which has a leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at its amino terminus. The cell wall of The inventors of this invention previously constructed a plasmid carrying a DNA fragment prepared from chromosomal DNA of a Bacillus strain, and coding for production and extracellular secretion of penicillinase. They introduced the plasmid into Further, they succeeded in the construction of a plasmid carrying a DNA fragment prepared from chromosomal DNA of a Bacillus strain and coding for the production and extracellular secretion of xylanase. They introduced the plasmid into By culturing such a strain containing a plasmid carrying a DNA fragment coding for the production and secretion of useful physiologically active substances such as enzymes, it is possible to separate and collect the active substances directly from the culture medium in a greater amount and in a more purified form because there is no need for crushing the cells of the strain and there is no saturation of the active substances within the cells. However, useful physiologically active substances are ordinarily accumulated mainly within cells and up to now there have been known only restricted numbers of microorganisms which produce and secrete the useful physiologically active substance into media. Therefore, it is very useful from the industrial point of view to establish a method in which it is possible to create a desired strain which produces and secretes a desired useful physiologically active substance into media. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a novel plasmid which gives a microorganism transformed therewith the ability to produce and secrete a useful physiologically active substance into the fermentation medium. Another object of this invention is to provide a method for construction of such plasmid, a novel microorganism transformed with the same and a method for culturing the microorganism to obtain a useful physiologically active substance. This invention provides a plasmid which provides a host with the ability to produce and secrete xylanase and which comprises a DNA fragment from chromosomal DNA of a strain of the genus The plasmid can be constructed by a process which comprises This invention provides a novel microorganism which is a transformed microorganism harbouring the plasmid of the invention, having the ability to produce and secrete penicillinase and xylanase. This invention further provides a method for the production of Xylanase, which comprises Fig. 1 shows a scheme for illustrating the process for construction of the plasmid, pEAP2, and the restriction enzyme cleavage map therefor. Fig. 2 shows a scheme for illustrating the process for construction of the plasmid, pAX1, and the restriction enzyme cleavage map therefor. Fig. 3 shows a scheme for illustrating the process for construction of the plasmid, pXP102 3, and the restriction enzyme cleavage map therefor. Fig. 4 shows bacterial growth and production of xylanase, beta galactosidase and beta lactamase by Fig. 5 shows bacterial growth and production of xylanase by Fig. 6 shows bacterial growth and production of penicillinase and beta galactosidase by The term useful physiologically active substance used in the specification means a high molecular weight physiologically active compound such as an enzyme, e.g., penicillinase, xylanase, beta galactosidase, beta lactamase or alkaline phosphatase, or insulin, human growth hormone, interferon, antibiotic, etc. According to this invention, there is provided a plasmid which provides a host with an ability to produce and secrete both penicillinase and xylanase. The plasmid is constructed by inserting a DNA fragment coding for the production and secretion of penicillinase hereinafter referred to as penicillinase DNA fragment and a DNA fragment coding for the production of xylanase hereinafter referred to as xylanase DNA fragment into a vector plasmid. The plasmid of this invention can be constructed by inserting the xylanase DNA fragment into the cleavage site of a plasmid vector having the penicillinase DNA fragment inserted thereinto. The vector DNA which can be used in this invention is constructed by inserting the penicillinase DNA fragment into a cleavage site of a plasmid such as Col E₁, pMB9, pSC101, R6K, lambda phage. A typical example is the pEAP2 plasmid which is constructed by inserting the penicillinase DNA fragment prepared from a strain of the genus Alkalophilic The chromosomal DNA is digested with the restriction enzyme Hind III at 37 C for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes to obtain DNA fragments. Plasmid pMB9 Bethesda Research Laboratories, U.S.A., tetracyclin resistant Tet Three fold volume of ethanol is added to the mixture. Plasmids carrying the chromosomal DNA fragments are precipitated and collected. The plasmids thus obtained are introduced into a host. The transformant having the desired characteristics is selected and propagated to clone the pEAP2 plasmid. As such a host, a microorganism of the genus Transformation with the pEAP2 plasmid will now be illustrated. The plasmid pEAP2 is a cyclic DNA molecule of about 7.7 kb containing the penicillinase DNA fragment of about 2.0 kb prepared from the chromosomal DNA of The process for the construction of the plasmid pEAP2 and the restriction enzyme cleavage map of it are as shown in Fig. 1. An illustrative example of a microorganism containing the xylanase DNA fragment is a strain of the genus Cloning of the chromosomal DNA is carried out as follows. The chromosomal DNA is treated with the restriction enzyme Hind III to obtain DNA fragments. A vector plasmid, pBR322 Bethesda Research Laboratories, U.S.A., tetracyclin resistant Tc The strain thus obtained contains the plasmid pAX1 in which the chromosomal DNA fragment has been inserted and it has the ability to produce xylanase but not to secrete it. The strain is propagated and the cells are collected, whereafter the plasmid pAX1 is isolated therefrom. The plasmid pAX1 is cleaved with Hind III to obtain a cloned xylanase DNA fragment. The plasmid pAX1 is a cyclic DNA molecule of about 10.4 kb containing the xylanase DNA fragment of about 6.0 kb prepared from the chromosomal DNA of The process for construction of the plasmid pAX1 and the restriction enzyme cleavage map of it are as shown in Fig. 2. The plasmid of this invention can be constructed by conventional methods, e.g. the shot gun cloning method, for inserting a DNA fragment coding for the production of a useful physiologically active substance e.g., the xylanase DNA fragment into a vector DNA. Construction of the plasmid of this invention will now be explained by the following example in which the plasmid pEAP2 is used as a vector plasmid and a xylanase DNA fragment obtained by cleaving the plasmid pAx1 containing the chromosomal DNA of The plasmid pAX1 containing the xylanase DNA fragment is cleaved with the restriction enzyme Bgl II at 37 C for 60 minutes to obtain the xylanase DNA fragment . The vector plasmid pEAP2 containing the penicillinase DNA fragment is fully cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI, then heated at 65 C for 5 minutes, and mixed with the xylanase DNA fragment . The mixture is treated with T₄ phage DNA ligase to insert the fragment into the Bam HI restriction site of the plasmid pEAP2 and then heated at 65 C for 5 minutes. The resulting mixture of plasmids including the plasmid pXP102 3 is treated again with Bam HI and Bgl II and then with T4 phage DNA ligase in order to increase the concentration of the plasmid pXP102 3. The transformant The strain The plasmid pXP102 3 is a cyclic DNA molecule of 11.7 kb containing the xylanase DNA fragment prepared from the chromosomal DNA of The process for construction of the plasmid pXP102 3 and the restriction enzyme cleavage map of it are as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, For culturing the transformant of this invention, there can be used any culture media suitable for the production of specific substances for which a specific genetic information codes and suitable for the growth of the microorganisms of the genus Examples of inorganic salts which can be used in the present invention include sodium and potassium salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride and the like, among which sodium chloride is preferred. Examples of carbon sources include glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, glycerol, bran, xylan and the like. The media which can be used in this invention may contain nitrogen sources as ammonia water, ammonium salts and the like, inorganic ions and optionally such nutrients as amino acids, vitamins and the like Typical examples of the media which can be used in the present invention are those which use, as a basic medium, LB broth containing tryptone, yeast extract and NaCl , BPB broth Difco Laboratories containing polypeptone, yeast extract and K₂HPO₄ , nutrient broth Difco 0001 , tryptone NaCl broth or the like. Since almost all products remain in the intracellular space in a medium containing no inorganic salt, it is necessary to use a medium containing an inorganic salt so that most products will be secreted out of the cells into the culture medium. The amount of inorganic salt used is in the range of 0.1 3.0 by weight on the basis of the culture medium. Although culture conditions such as pH, temperature, oxygen supply or the like can be adjusted for the optimum growth of the microorganism of the genus After the inoculation of the microorganism of the genus According to the culture method of the present invention, in addition to enzyme proteins, such fermentation products as antibiotics or polysaccharides can be produced in a significant amount in the media. This method can be applied to the cultivation of any microorganisms transformed with a plasmid carrying a foreign DNA coding for biologically active substances such as hormone peptides e.g. insulin or interferon and the DNA coding for production and secretion of biologically active substances, which enables mass production of biologically active substances such as insulin, interferon and the like. As explained above, the present invention contributes to the industrial production of useful biologically active substances. Examples of microorganisms which may be used in this invention include i The depository and accession numbers of the above mentioned microorganisms are shown below This invention provides a plasmid which can be constructed by inserting a chromosomal DNA fragment coding for production but not secretion of the useful physiologically active substance xylanase into a restriction enzyme cleavage site of a vector plasmid which provides a host with the ability to produce and secrete penicillinase. The plasmid thus constructed provides a host with the ability to produce and secrete the useful physiologically active substance xylanase in addition to penicillinase.
