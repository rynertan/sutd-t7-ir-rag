# METHOD OF SPINNING PITCH BASED CARBON FIBERS

## Abstract
A method of spinning a pitch precursor material to pro duce a continuous pitch base carbon fiber 10 , in which the precursor material is spun through capillaries 11 of a spin nerette 12 such that a fiber carrot 13 formed during spin ning will exhibit a viscosity of at least 230 Pa.s at or near a point of spin reversal 17 of the fiber carrot 13 .
