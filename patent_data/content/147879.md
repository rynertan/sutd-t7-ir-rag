## Description
Process for the preparation of a hydroxylamineThe present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a hydroxylamine of the formulaEMI1.1 In compound A, the groups R1, R2, R3, R4 and Rs each represent a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group, a halogen atom, a linear or branched chain alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl group, a phenylalkyl or alkylphenyl group, the alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or wherein two of the groups R1, Rz, R3, R4 or Rs attached to adjacent carbon atoms of the benzene ring together with the two carbon atoms of the benzene ring to which they are attached form a second benzene ring which is ortho condensed with the first benzene ring. In compound B, the group R represents a linear or a branched chain and or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms.In so far as the Groups R11 R5 or R are hydrocarbon containing groups, they may have unsaturated bonds and may comprise substituents and groups such as amino, hydroxylamino, amido, cyano, hydroxy alkoxy, carboxyl, oxycarbonyl, carboxy, sulphoxide and suiphone. The groups R1 R 5 or R may be combined to form part of a polymeric structure.The aromatic hydroxylamine A can be obtained as a result of the corresponding nitro derivative being hydrogenated in the presence of an inert solvent, a platinum catalyst and a nitrogen containing base.This process is known from US Patent Specification 3 927 101. In said disclosure it is stated that in order to obtain sufficiently high yields of hydroxylamines the ratio by weight of the organic base to the nitro compound should be greater than 0.1 1, preferably between 0.5 1 and 5 1. Further disclosed is that the use of the base in trace amounts does not make it possible to stop the hydrogenation at the hydroxylamine stage.After the hydrogenation reaction is completed, the organic base has to be removed. It has been observed that by using the above mentioned high amounts of organic base, problems might arise upon isolating the hydroxylamine.It has now been found that equivalent and even higher yields of hydroxylamine can be obtained with a process of the above type which is characterized in that the nitrogen containing base is present in an amount of less than 10 by weight, calculated on the amount of the nitro derivative and that the hydrogenation is carried out in the further presence of a tri or pentavalent organic phosphorus compound.It has been found that if only use is made of the phosphorus compound or the nitrogen containing base in an amount of less than 10 by weight, calculated on the amount of nitro derivative, the yields of isolated hydroxylamines are significantly reduced in comparison with those obtained with the process in the present invention.It should be added that Japanese patent publication No.30.096 82 discloses the use of trivalent phosphorus compounds in reactions of the present type. However, this publication does not mention the present combination with the nitrogen containing base.Furthermore, U.S. 3 441 610 describes the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroalkanes to N alkyl h ydroxylamines. Use is made of a recovered palladium catalyst and a cation of iron, nickel or cobalt in a two phase liquid system of aqueous sulphuric acid and an immiscible organic solvent.In such an acidic medium the loss of catalyst will be considerable and the equipment may be subject to severe corrosion. These disadvantages are circumvented by the present invention.The present invention relates to a process for the selective catalytic preparation of hydroxylamines with the structure A or B by selective catalytic hydrogenation of corresponding nitro derivatives.The problem associated with the use of platinum containing catalysts, is to prevent the nitro derivatives from being reduced to amines in the hydrogenation stage.
