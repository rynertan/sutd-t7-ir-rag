## Description
The present invention relates to a series of new carbapenem compounds and to compositions containing the compounds, and provides a process for preparing these compounds. The penicillins form a well known class of antibiotics, which have found considerable use in human and animal therapy for many years. Chemically, the penicillins have in common a β lactam structure, commonly referred to as penam , which may be represented by the following formula However, although the penicillins still form a valuable weapon in the pharmaceutical armory, the development of new, and often penicillin resistant, strains of pathogenic bacteria has increasingly made it necessary to search for new types of antibiotic. In recent years, great interest has been shown in compounds having a carbapenem structure, that is compounds having a carbon atom in place of the sulphur atom at the 1 position and having a double bond between the carbon atoms in the 2 and 3 positions of the basic penam structure. The carbapenem structure may be represented by the following formula These penam and carbapenem structures form the basis for the semi systematic nomenclature of the penicillin derivatives in accordance with the recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC , and this nomenclature is generally accepted by those skilled in the art throughout the world and is used herein. The numbering system employed herein is that illustrated on the above formulae. Of the known carbapenem derivatives, the best known is a compound called thienamycin , whose semi systematic name is 2 2 aminoethylthio 6 1 hydroxyethyl carbapen 2 em 3 carboxylic acid. Although thienamycin is known to have remarkably potent and broad antibacterial activity, its chemical stability in the human body is poor, which restricts its practical use. Various attempts have, therefore, been made to modify the chemical structure of thienamycin in order to improve its chemical stability whilst maintaining or improving its superior activity. In recent years, as interest in the carbapenem compounds has increased, a large number of carbapenem derivatives has been proposed in a variety of publications in an attempt to overcome various of the problems associated with thienamycin, and, in particular, in order to improve stability and improve antibacterial activity. Of the prior art, the closest prior art to the present invention is believed to be European Patent Publication No. 10,317, which discloses a series of carbapenem compounds in which substituents at the 1 , 2 and 6 positions are chosen from an extremely long list of groups and atoms, whose general terms cover some of the appropriate substituents on the compounds of the invention. Also close prior art is European Patent Publication No. 72,710, which discloses a limited class of carbapenem derivatives having a heterocyclyl thio group at the 2 position the compounds of this prior art, however, differ from those of the present invention in that they lack a substituent at the 1 position. Also relevant prior art, in that they disclose compounds having substituents at the 1 position, are U.S. Patents No. 4,206,219 and No. 4,260,627 the compounds disclosed in these U.S patents, however, differ from those of the present invention in that, respectively, they lack a substituent at the 2 position or, whilst having a wide range of substituents at the 2 position, do not contemplate a heterocyclyl thio substituent. The following documents all relate to carbapenems bearing a superficially close resemblance to the compounds of the invention, but differing in the 2 position US A 4312871 EP A 0089139 EP A 0071908 EP A 0060077 and EP A 0010317. We have now discovered a class of compounds, of which those compounds investigated have been found to exhibit far better absorption and metabolic stability as evidenced by improved recovery rates in the urine than the compounds of European Patent Publication No. 72,710 and which have a broader antibacterial spectrum, stronger activity and greater stability than thienamycin. The compounds of the invention are those compounds which may be represented by the formula I wherein The compounds of the invention, being acids, are capable of forming salts and esters. The nature of such salts and esters is not critical to the present invention and the compounds of formula I are capable of forming salts and esters with any cations and ester forming alcohols, respectively, which are known for the formation of salts and esters with compounds of this type. The only restriction on the nature of such salts and esters is that they should be pharmaceutically acceptable which means to those skilled in the art that the salt forming cation or ester forming alcohol should not, or should not to an unacceptable extent, reduce the activity of the compounds of formula I , nor should they increase, or increase to an unacceptable extent, the toxicity of those compounds. However, the formation of salts and esters and the application of these criteria to the choice of salt forming cations or ester forming alcohols is so well known to the man skilled in the art as to require no further definition here. Examples of suitable esters include C₁ C₆ preferably C₁ C₄, alkyl esters, such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and t butyl esters C₁ C₆, preferably C₁ C₄, haloalkyl esters, which may have one or more halogen atoms the maximum number of halogen atoms being dictated by the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group, but preferably being from 1 to 3 , such as the 2 iodoethyl, 2,2 dibromoethyl and 2,2,2 trichloroethyl esters alkoxymethyl esters, wherein the alkoxy part has from 1 to 6, preferably from 1 to 4, carbon atoms, for example the methoxymethyl, propoxymethyl, isopropoxymethyl, butoxymethyl and isobutoxymethyl esters aliphatic carboxylic acyloxymethyl esters, wherein the acyl part which may have saturated or unsaturated carbon carbon bonds, preferably all saturated, has from 2 to 7, preferably from 2 to 5, carbon atoms, for example the acetoxymethyl, propionyloxymethyl, butyryloxymethyl, isobutyryloxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters 1 alkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters, where the alkoxy part has from 1 to 6, preferably from 1 to 4, carbon atoms, for example the 1 methoxycarbonyloxyethyl, 1 ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl, 1 propoxycarbonyloxyethyl, 1 isopropoxycarbonyloxyethyl, 1 butoxycarbonyloxyethyl and 1 isobutoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters aralkyl esters, where the aryl part has from 6 to 10 ring carbon atoms and is unsubstituted or has one or more preferably from 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of those substituents listed above as possible substituents on ring carbon atoms and preferably C₁ C₃ alkoxy groups, nitro groups, C₁ C₃ alkyl groups, hydroxy groups and halogen atoms , for example the benzyl, Esters of compounds of formula I are capable of forming acid addition salts. As with the salts and esters defined above, the nature of the acids employed to form these salts is not critical and is only limited, where the compounds of the invention are intended for pharmaceutical use, by the requirement that the resulting acid addition salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Accordingly, a wide range of acids can be employed to form such acid addition salts. Examples include such mineral acids as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid, preferably hydrochloric acid. The compounds of formula I can also form salts with a wide variety of cations. Examples of salts which may be employed in the present invention include metal salts, particularly alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, such as the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts salts with basic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine ammonium salts and salts with organic amines, such as cyclohexylamine, diisopropylamine or triethylamine. Of these, the alkali metal, particularly sodium and potassium, salts are preferred. The compounds of the invention can also exist in the form of hydrates and these likewise form part of the present invention. Preferred compounds are those in which the 3 pyrrolidinyl group represented by R³ has a ring carbon atom carbamoyl substituent and a ring nitrogen atom substituent C R⁵ N R⁶ which is a formyl, acetyl, glycyl, alanyl, formimidoyl, acetimidoyl, propionimidoyl or α methoxyacetimidoyl group. The compounds of the present invention can exist in the form of various optical isomers and stereoisomers due to the presence of asymmetric carbon atoms. Although all of these isomers are represented herein by a single formula, it should be understood that the present invention envisages both the individual isolated isomers, as well as mixtures of isomers. Preferred compounds are those in which the carbon atom at the 5 position is in the same configuration as in thienamycin, that is to say the In the preferred compounds of the invention, the methyl group at the 1 position is preferably in the Examples of preferred compounds of the invention are given in the following list in this list, the configuration of substituents is not specified and each of the compounds given in this list may be in any of the possible configurations or may be a mixture of isomers however, the listed compounds are preferably 5 The compounds of the invention may be prepared by Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be prepared by the following process Preparation of the compounds of the invention is described in more detail in the following Methods. In this Method, compounds of formula I are prepared as illustrated in the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R³, R Where any of the substituents on the compound of formula II is carboxy group, such groups may be left unprotected, but are preferably protected prior to carrying out any other reactions such protection has no significance in the overall reaction scheme, in that protecting groups are normally removed at the end of the reaction sequence, but does have the substantial practical advantage that it improves overall yields by reducing the possibility of side reactions. Accordingly, the nature of the protecting groups employed is in no way critical to the present invention and a very wide range of protecting groups may be used, the nature of such protecting groups being dependent on the nature of the group which it is intended to protect. Such protecting groups are extremely well known to those skilled in this art and require no specific definition here. However, examples of suitable protecting groups are discussed hereafter in relation to step A3, where the protecting groups are removed. In step A1 of this reaction scheme, the compound of formula II is reacted with a compound of formula IIa Instead of using the compound of formula IIa as such, it is possible to employ an active derivative of such a compound. Suitable active derivatives include anhydrides and halides, particularly chlorides. In particular, we prefer to employ an anhydrous alkanesulphonic acid, an anhydrous arylsulphonic acid, a dialkylphosphoryl halide or a diarylphosphoryl halide. Preferred alkanesulphonic acids include methanesulphonic acid and ethanesulphonic acid. Preferred arylsulphonic acids include benzenesulphonic acid and The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or upon the reagents, in particular the β lactam ring. Preferred bases are organic bases, particularly triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is likewise not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane and chloroform nitriles, such as acetonitrile and amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. The reaction may be carried out over a wide range of temperatures, the reaction temperature not being critical, but we prefer to employ a relatively low temperature, in order to reduce or control side reactions. Accordingly, we prefer to employ a temperature of from 20 C to 40 C. The time required for the reaction will vary depending upon many factors, but particularly on the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents however, a period of from 10 minutes to 5 hours will normally suffice. The resulting compound of formula III is then reacted in step A2 with a mercaptan of formula IIIa The reaction temperature is not critical, but, in order to reduce or control side reactions, a relatively low temperature is preferably employed. A suitable temperature is from 20 C to room temperature. The time required for the reaction will vary depending upon many factors, but primarily upon the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, a period of from 30 minutes to 8 hours will normally suffice. After completion of the above reactions, the resulting product of formula IV may, if desired, be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery procedure comprises distilling the reaction solvent from the reaction mixture adding a water immiscible organic solvent to the residue washing the mixture with water and, if necessary, drying it and distilling off the solvent to give the desired product. If necessary, the resulting product may be further purified by a variety of conventional means adapted to the precise nature of the product suitable further purification techniques include recrystallization, reprecipitation and the various chromatographic techniques, for example column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography. Step A3 of the reaction scheme is optional and involves a variety of possible reactions, any one or more of which may be employed, in any suitable order, if desired. Thus, if the compound of formula IV obtained as described above contains a carboxy protecting group, for example if the group represented by R²⁰ is a protected carboxy group, the carboxy protecting group may be removed to leave a free carboxy group the reactions employed to do this are conventional and depend upon the nature of the protecting group. If the protecting group is removable by reduction, for example if it is a haloalkyl group, an aralkyl group or a benzhydryl group, it may be removed by contact with a reducing agent. In the case of haloalkyl groups, such as the 2,2 dibromoethyl or 2,2,2 trichloroethyl groups, the preferred reducing agent is a combination of zinc with acetic acid. If the protecting group is an aralkyl group such as a benzyl or After completion of the reaction, the desired compound, which will contain a free carboxy group, may be recovered by conventional means from the reaction mixture. For example, a suitable recovery technique comprises separating off any insolubles washing the organic solvent layer with water and, if necessary, drying it and then distilling off the solvent to give the desired product. This may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallization or the various chromatography techniques, such as preparative thin layer chromatography or column chromatography. Removal of these hydroxy protecting or amino protecting groups may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with or after removal of any carboxy protecting group in a protected carboxy group represented by R²⁰. For example, if the protecting group, is a lower e.g. C₁ C₇ aliphatic acyloxy group, such as an acetoxy group, this may be removed by treating the corresponding compound with a base in the presence of an aqueous solvent. The nature of the solvent is not critical and any much solvent commonly used for hydrolysis reactions may be employed. However, we normally prefer to use water or a mixture of water with an organic solvent, such as an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol or propanol or an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxane . The nature of the base is also not critical to the process, provided that it does not adversely affect any other part of the compound, notably the β lactam ring preferred bases are alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. The reaction temperature is not critical, but we normally prefer to employ a temperature of from 0 C to about room temperature, in order to reduce or control side reactions. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, including the nature of the starting materials and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 1 to 6 hours will normally suffice. If the hydroxy protecting group is an aralkyloxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl or Where the compound contains a trialkylsilyloxy group in which each alkyl group has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms for example a If the compound of formula IV contains a haloacetyl group such as a trifluoroacetyl or trichloroacetyl group as a hydroxy protecting or amino protecting group, this may be eliminated by treating the compound with a base in the presence of an aqueous solvent. The nature of the bases and the reaction conditions are the same as are employed for removal of lower aliphatic acyl groups when employed as hydroxy protecting groups in the group represented by R Also at this stage, where R³ in the resulting compound of formula I or R The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. A suitable solvent is an aqueous phosphate buffer solution whose composition is such as to maintain a pH value of about 8. Although the reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, in order to reduce or control side reactions, we prefer to employ a relatively low temperature, for example a temperature of from 0 C to about room temperature. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, including the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 10 minutes to 2 hours will normally suffice. After completion of this reaction, the desired product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means and, if necessary, further purified by such conventional techniques as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography and column chromatography. After completion of the reactions described above, the desired product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, when the reaction is carried out in a buffer solution, the desired product is preferably separated by column chromatography, for example through a column of Diaion trade mark HP 20AG a product of Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Co Ltd . On the other hand, if the compound is obtained by reaction in an organic solvent, the solution is washed with water if necessary, after transferring the product into solution in a water immiscible organic solvent , the solution is, if necessary, dried, and then the solvent is distilled off to give the desired product. This product may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional techniques, for example by recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, such as preparative thin layer chromatography or column chromatography. As an alternative to Method A, compounds of the invention may be prepared by the method illustrated by the following reaction scheme. In the above formulae, R In step C1 of this reaction scheme, the compound of formula VII is reacted with a compound of formula VIII , to give a compound of formula IX . This compound of formula IX is reacted in step C2 first with water and then with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, for example palladium on charcoal, to give the compound of formula X . If any of the groups contains a protecting group removable by reduction, then this may be removed during this step. In step C3, the compound of formula X is reacted with a mercaptan of formula R The compound of formula XI is then reacted in step C4 with an oxalyl halide derivative of formula XIa This compound of formula XII is reacted, in step C5, with a phosphorus compound of formula P R²⁷ 3. Particularly preferred phosphorus compounds are the trialkyl phosphites, of which triethyl phosphite, tripropyl phosphite and triisopropyl phosphite are the most preferred. This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent, for example an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, such as hexane, benzene, toluene or xylene a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform, methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane an ester, such as ethyl acetate an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane a nitrile, such as acetonitrile or an amide, such as dimethylformamide. The reaction of step C5 is preferably effected with heating, for example at a temperature within the range from 50 to 150 C. The time required for the reaction will vary depending upon many factors, including the nature of the reagents and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 1 to 10 hours will normally suffice. At the end of this time, the solvent and other substances are distilled off under reduced pressure, giving the compound of formula XIII . Depending upon the reaction temperature and the time allowed for the reaction, the compound of formula XIII may already have undergone cyclization to convert some or all of that compound into the compound of formula IV . Thus, if the reaction in step C5 was carried out at a temperature within the range of from 80 to 150 C for a period of from 10 hours to 5 days, without isolation of the compound of formula XIII , the compound IV is obtained directly. If, however, the compound has not undergone cyclization, then it is preferably heated, e.g. at a temperature within the range from 80 to 150 C for a period of from 10 hours to 5 days, to give the desired compound of formula IV as step C6. If desired, the resulting compound of formula IV may be subjected to any of the reactions heretofore described in step A3 of Method A to give the compound of formula I or a salt or ester thereof. The compounds obtained by any of the above Methods may, if desired, be salified and or esterified by conventional means, to give salts and or esters thereof, examples of such salts and esters being given previously. Some of the compounds of formula I have, in themselves, outstanding antibacterial activity, whilst others, although generally exhibiting some antibacterial activity, are of more value as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds having good antibacterial activity. Those compounds having antibacterial activity exhibit this effect against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, including both gram positive bacteria such as Certain of the compounds of the invention were investigated for their activities against various microorganisms. The compounds tested were The activities of the test compounds of the invention, identified by the letters assigned to them above, against various bacteria are shown in the following Table, in terms of their minimal inhibitory concentrations µg ml . As can be seen from the above Table, the activities of the compounds of the invention, in the It is well known in the art that compounds having a low minimal inhibitory concentration, and which are, as a result, expected to be valuable in chemotherapy, sometimes fail to show a good antibacterial effect when they are administered to humans or other animals. This may be due to various causes, for example chemical or physiological instability of the compounds, poor distribution of the compounds in the body or binding of the compounds to blood serum. The compounds of the invention, however, do not seem to exhibit such problems and thus are expected to show a remarkable The compounds of the invention may be administered either orally or parenterally for the treatment of diseases in humans and other animals caused by pathogenic microorganisms. The compounds may be formulated into any conventional forms for administration. For example, for oral administration, suitable formulations include tablets, granules, capsules, powders and syrups, whilst formulations for parenteral administration include injectable solutions for intramuscular or, more preferably intravenous, injection. The compounds of the invention are preferably administered parenterally, particularly in the form of an intravenous injection. The dose of the compound of the invention will vary, depending upon the age, body weight and condition of the patient, as well as upon the form and times of administration. However, in general the adult daily dose is from 200 to 3000 mg of the compound, which may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses. The preparation of compounds of the invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. 0.174 ml of diisopropyl ethyl amine and 0.245 ml of diphenylphosphoryl chloride were added, under a nitrogen atmosphere and with ice cooling, to 5 ml of an acetonitrile solution containing 363 mg of 80 ml of water and 1.6 g of 10 w w palladium on carbon were added to 50 ml of a tetrahydrofuran solution containing 450 mg of The procedure described in Example 1 was repeated, but using 365 mg of The catalytic hydrogenation process described in Example 2 was repeated, but using 360 mg of The procedure described in Example 1 was repeated, but using 363 mg of The catalytic hydrogenation process described in Example 2 was repeated, but using 430 mg of The process described in Example 1 was repeated, but using 1.35 g of The catalytic hydrogenation process described in Example 2 was repeated, but using 0.8 g of 100 mg of 1 264 mg of 839 mg of the crude product obtained as described in Example 8 were treated in the same manner as in Example 2 to give 67 mg of the title compound.
