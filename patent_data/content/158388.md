# Device for and method of assembling an integrated electron gun system.

## Abstract
Device for assembling an integrated electron gun sys tem 5 for a colour display tube of the in line type is composed of a number of electrodes centred around an axis, which device comprises a few centring pins 60, 61, 62 situated with their longitudinal axes substantially in one plane, on which the electrodes are positioned and are then fixed mechanically with respect to each other. If such a device comprises three centring pins 60, 61, 62 which, at least at the area of the apertures in the electrodes, have a substantially elongate perpendicular cross section so that only restricted parts 64,65 of the centring pins contact the inner wall of the apertures in the electrode, the longitudinal axes of the cross sections of the outermost pins being substantially perpendicular to the said surface and the longitudinal axes of the cross section of the central centring pin being substantially situated in the said plane, the electrode can be positioned more accurately than with the device used up till now. If in addition at least two reference surfaces 67 and 73, 74 are used for the positioning of the electrodes in the axial direction, in which the location of the control grid, the first anode and the second anode is determined by a first reference surface 73, 74 and the location of the focusing lens electrodes is determined by a second reference surface, which first reference surface is determined by reentrant surfaces 73, 74 provided perpendi cularly to the axes of the outermost centring pins, and the second reference surface 67 is determined by the base in which the centring pins are connected, it is possible to position the electrodes even more accurately with respect to each other as a result of which the spreading in the beam displacement is reduced by at least 50 .
