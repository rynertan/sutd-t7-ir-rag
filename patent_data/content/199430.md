# A REACTIVATEABLE ADSORPTION FILTER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A reactivateable adsorption filter assembly is described in which to reactivate the adsorption filter element 11 a purge valve 15 is opened causing filtered fluid stored in the storage vessel 18 to flow back through the adsorption filter element 11 and out of the filter assembly via the purge valve 15 . A flow restrictor 19 is positioned between the storage vessel 18 and the filter element 11 to provide a large volume of fluid containing adsorbate at a very low partial pressure during the reactivation process.
