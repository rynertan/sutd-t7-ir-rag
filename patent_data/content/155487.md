# FLUID MACHINE

## Abstract
A fluid machine has a cylinder block rotating together with a rotary shaft and having cylinder bores which receive pistons. The pistons are connected to a swash plate which in turn is connected to the rotary shaft through a universal joint. A fluid is puped by the reciprocating motion of the pistons which is caused by the rotation of the cylinder block. This machine exhibits a superior mechanical eficiency thanks to the use of the universal joint.
