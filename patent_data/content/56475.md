SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of one aspect of this invention to provide novel compounds. Another aspect is to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions which can be used as medicaments. Still other objects include methods of effecting pharmaceutical activities. Upon further study of the specification and appended claims, further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise compounds of Formula IEMI1.1 whereinEMI1.2 stands for an aromatic or heteroaromatic system which may be substituted or un substituted and X Iz is OH e pr an anion of a strong acid. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Some compounds of Formula I are known, particularly some of those wherein X is C1 Herz compounds . Some of these known compounds have been used as postemergent herbicides and dyestuff intermediates as described inU.S. Patents No. 3,490,893 and 3,808,202 and references cited therein cf. also The Merck Index, ninth edition, 1976,Merck Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J., Organic Name Reactions, page ONR 42, Herz Reaction11, and references cited therein , all said patents and references being incorporated herein. In German Patent No. 487,849, filed May 15, 1923 byLeopold Casella Co., there is mentioned in Example 3 C a compound of the formula EMI2.1 obtained by condensation of arsanilic acid with the product obtained from 1 naphthylamine and S2C12. The above compound is indicated for a therapeutic use, broadly speaking, but without any specifics whatsoever as to the type of therapy or how it is to be administered. In any case, this compound is excluded from the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention which are not based on any field of intended therapy. Conversely, where a specific utility is associated with a pharmaceutical composition or method of administration, this compound is intended to be included among the active ingredients.

The compounds of Formula I particularlyFormula Ia can also be obtained by reaction of corresponding 2 amino thiols of Formula IIIEMI39.1 wherein Z is as above, with thionyl chloride, in the presence or preferably in the absence of an additional inert solvent, preferably at temperatures between 0 ane 800. In particular, those compounds of Formula Ia having hydrogen at the 6 position can be obtained by this method. Bydroxides of Formulae I or Ia X OH can be prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding salts, particularly the chlorides X C1 f.e. by stirring with water at temperatures between 15 and 300. A hydroxide of Formula I X OH can be converted into an appropriate salt of Formula I P anion of a strong acid by treatment with such strong acid. Acids which give physiologically acceptable salts are suitable for this reaction. Thus, it is possible to use inorganic acids, for example sulfuric acid, hydrogen halide acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, e.g. orthophosphoric acid, nitric acid or sulfamic acid, and also strong organic acids, specifically, for example,, aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic mono basic or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, e.g., formic acid, methanesulfonic or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic acid, 2 hy droxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemonosulfonic and naphthalenedisulfonic acids and laurylsulfuric acid. It has been found that the compounds ofFormula I have valuable pharmacological properties and are well tolerated. Thus, for example, inhibiting effects on the binding of rat myeloma immunoglobulin E to receptors on rat peritoneal mast cells are observed. Furthermore, activities in inhibiting the IgE mediated release of histamine from human basophils and rat mast cells are noted. Compounds of Formula I have been found active in preventing mast cells in the skin of rats from being passively sensitized by antisera. These pharmacological activities were determined by conventional tests For human basophil see Siraganian, R.P. and Brodsky, M.J.,Automated Histamine Analysis for In Vitro Testing,J. Allergy Clin.

The compounds of Formula I can, therefore, be used as active ingredients in medicaments in human and veterinary medicine for administration, e.g., to mammals including humans, and also as intermediate products for the preparation of other active compounds for medicaments. Thus, this invention, in another aspect, also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula I in preparation of pharmaceutical formulations, especially by a non chemical route. In such methods, they can be brought into a suitable dosage form together with at least one excipient or auxiliary and, if appropriate, in combination with one or more additional active compounds. The invention, in another aspect also relates to agents, in particular pharmaceutical formulations containing at least one compound of Formula I.These formulations can be employed as inedicaments in human or veterinary medicine. Suitable excipients include organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral for example oral or parenteral administration or for topical application and which do not react with the active compounds, for example, water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates, such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc or petroleum jelly. Tablets, dragees, capsules, syrups, elixirs, drops or suppositories are used particularly for enteral administration, solutions, preferably ol based or aqueous solutions, and also suspensions, emulsions or implants are used particularly for parenteral administration, while ointments, creams or powders are used for topical application. The compounds can also be lyophilized and the resulting lyophilizates can be used, for example, for the preparation of injection formulations. Furthermore, the compounds can be applied in the form of inhalation capsules, inhalation solutions, nasal sprays, nasal spray powders or eye drops.The formulations indicated can be sterilized and or can contain auxiliaries, such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers and or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, coloring substances, flavoring substances and or aroma generating substances. If desired, they can also contain one or more additional active compounds, for example, one or more vitamins. The present invention, in another aspect, also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula I in therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and in combating diseases, in particular all forms of allergic and asthmatic diseases, specifically asthma bronchiale, allergic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, asthma with infectious allergic background, food allergy cases of eczema, urticaria, Quincke edema, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, asthma and rhinitis caused by food allergens , hay fever, allergic rhinitis seasonal and perennial , allergic conjunctivitis, allergic unspecific irritation of the conjunctiva.In general, the substances of this invention are administered in ar.alogy to known, commercially available formulations with a similar indication for example disodium cxoglycate crottolyn preferably in dosages of approximately 1 400 mug, in particular, of 5 200 mg, per dosage unit.
