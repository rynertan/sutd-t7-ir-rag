## Description
Semiconductor device The present invention relates to a semiconductor device including resistive elements. In general resistive elements used in integrated circuit devices are formed of metal films, polycrystalline silicon layers, diffusion regions, etc. Of those, diffusion resistive elements are predominantly used. Fig. 1 shows a model of an integrated circuit device including a diffusion resistive region. The integrated circuit device is comprised of a p type semiconductor substrate 1, an isolated region 2 of n type formed in the substrate, and a p type diffusion resistive region 3 formed in the surface area of the isolated region 2. In the integrated circuit device, the potential of the isolated region 2 is set at a value higher than the potential of the substrate and the resistive region 3 in order to prevent the formation of parasitic elements such as pnp transistors. When no current flows through the resistive re gion 3, the width of a depletion layer 4, as indicated by a broken line in the drawing, which is formed in a p n junction area between the regions 3 and 2, has a fixed value determined by a potential difference between the regions 3 and 2. On the other hand, when a current flows through the resistive region 3, the width of the depletion layer 4 is gradually made larger in a direction of the current flow, as indicated by a broken line in Fig. 2. As a result, an effective resistance of the diffusion resistive region 3 varies in accordance with a change of a signal voltage applied between both ends of the resistive region 3.In other words, an effective width of the depletion layer 4, i.e. the effective width of the diffusion resistive region 3, changes with the signal voltage applied to the diffusion resistive region 3, with the result that the effective resistance of the region 3 varies. As described above, in the prior art integrated circuit device, the resistance of the diffusion resistive region varies with the signal voltage applied to the resistive region 3. Therefore, the effective resistance of.the resistive region 3 varies, leading to deterioration of the electrical performance of the integrated circuit device. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device including a diffusion resistive element whose effective resistance is kept substantially invariable during operation. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor layer of one conductivity type a diffusion resistive region of the opposite conductivity type formed in the surface area of the semiconductor layer first and second impurity regions at higher impurity concentration than that of the semiconductor layer, the impurity regions being formed in the surface area of the semiconductor layer while sandwiching the diffusion resistive region a current feeding device electrically coupled with the first and second impurity regions for feeding a current into the semiconductor layer in the same direction as that of current flowing into the diffusion resistive region. In the present invention, the current flows into the isolated region in the same direction as that of current flowing into the diffusion resistive region.Accordingly, a substantially fixed reverse bias voltage is applied to the pn junction between the isolated region and the diffusion region. The result is that the width of a depletion layer formed in the junction area between the isolated region and the diffusion resistive region is substantially constant. Therefore, an effective resistance of the diffusion resistive region is kept substantially constant. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates a model of a prior art integrated circuit device for illustrating the state of a depletion layer formed in the junction area between an isolated region and a diffusion resistive region formed in a surface area of the isolated region when no current flows through the diffusion resistive region Fig. 2 shows a model of the prior art device for illustrating the state of a depletion layer formed in the junction area between the isolated region and diffusion resistive region when a current flows into the resistive region Fig. 3 shows a graph illustrating the relationship of an input signal voltage applied across the diffusion resistive region and the effective resistance of the diffusion resistive region Fig. 4 shows a partial plan view of a semiconductor device which is an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 5 shows a cross sectional view taken along line V V of Fig. 4 Fig. 6 shows a circuit diagram of a current feed circuit applicable for the semiconductor device shown in Figs. 4 and 5 Fig. 7 shows a model of a semiconductor device illustrating the state of a depletion layer formed in the junction area between a diffusion resistive region and an isolated region when the current feed circuit shown in Fig. 6 is used and Fig. 8 shows a graph illustrating the relationship between an input signal voltage applied to the diffusion resistive region and the effective resistance of the diffusion resistive region when the current feed circuit shown in Fig. 6 is used. Figs. 4 and 5 show a plan view and a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device embodying the present invention. The semiconductor device is comprised of a p type substrate 10, an n type region 12 formed in the surface area of the substrate 10, n type epitaxial layer 14 formed on the substrate 10 and the n type region 12, a p type layer 16 formed on the substrate 10 partially surrounding the n type region 14, and a p type diffusion region 18 forming a resistor which is formed in the surface area of the n type layer 14. As well illustrated in Fig. 4, a pair of n type regions 20 1 and 20 2 are formed in the surface area of the n type layer 14 and near the respective ends of the diffusion region 18, sandwiching the diffusion region 18. That is, the regions 20 l.and 20 2 are so formed that a current flows in the same direction as that of the current flowing into the diffusion region 18. A pair of electrodes 22 1 and 22 2 are formed in contact with both end portions of the diffusion region 18 and another pair of electrodes 24 1 and 24 2 are formed, respectively, in contact with the n type regions 20 1 and 20 2. The electrodes 24 1 and 24 2 are coupled with power source terminals VD1 and VD2, respectively. A power source voltage is applied between the power source terminals VD1 and VD2 so as to generate in the n type layer 14 between the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2 a voltage drop corresponding to a signal voltage applied to the resistive region 18, that is, the signal voltage applied between the electrodes 22 1 and 22 2. For example, in a case where the electrode 22 1 is held at a maximum signal potential VG, and a signal voltage from 0 to VG is applied between the electrodes 22 1 and 22 2, the power source voltages VD1 and VD2 VG are applied to the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2. In this case, it is preferable to set a difference voltage VDl VD2 between the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2 at a value of approximatelyVG 2. Fig. 6 shows a circuit for generating a voltage drop corresponding to the voltage drop of the resistive region 18 in an n type region 14 between the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2. The circuit is comprised of a resistor R1 connected at one end to the power source terminal VD, and pnp transistors TRI and TR2 whose emitter collector paths are connected in series between the other end of the resistor R1 and ground. A resistor R2 corresponding to the diffusion resistive region 18 is connected between the bases of the transistors TR1 and TR2.Both ends of the resistor R2 are connected to signal input terminals SV1 and SV2 which are also connected, although not shown here, to the electrodes 22 1 and 22 2 of the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 5, the emitters of the transistors TRI and TR2 are coupled with the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2, respectively. The resistances between the collectors and emitters of the transistors vary in accordance with the potentials at the signal input terminals SV1 and SV2, respectively. As a result, the emitter voltages of the transistors TRI and TR2 vary in accordance with a signal voltage. In this case, the voltage between the base and emitter of each of the transistors TRI and TR2 is held substantially constant. Accordingly, in the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 5, a fixed reverse bias voltage is applied between the isolated region 14 and the diffusion resistive region 18.When using the circuit shown in Fig. 6, the voltage between the electrodes 24 1 and 24 2 changes with a change of the signal voltage between the electrodes 22 1 and 22 2, so that the re verse blabs voltage applied to the pn junction between the n type region 14 and the resistive region 18 is always kept constant at any location of the pn junction.As a result, a depletion layer 25 with a fixed width is formed between the n type region 14 and the resistive region 18, as shown in Fig. 7. In this case, the width of the depletion layer is always kept at a fixed value.Therefore, it is possible to set an effective resistance of the resistive region 18 at a desired value with a high precision. The effective resistance of the resistive region 18 is kept substantially constant against a change of the signal voltage applied to the resistive region 18, as shown in Fig. 8. Accordingly, the electrical performance of the integrated circuit device may be improved. While a specific embodiment of the present invention has been described, it does not limit the present invention in any way. For example, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the n type region 12 is formed for preventing the formation of a parasitic element. This region may be omitted, if required. The p type substrate used in the above mentioned embodiment may be replaced by the n type substrate. In this case, the other regions must be of the opposite conductivity type.Further, the n type layer 14, which is formed on the substrate 10 in the above mentioned embodiment may be formed in the surface area of the substrate 10 when the n type region 12 is not formed. In this case, there is no need for forming the p type isolation region 16.
