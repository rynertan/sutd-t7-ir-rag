# Positive yarn feed.

## Abstract
A positive yarn feed device comprises a pin wheel mechanism 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 with independent drive means which comprise a variable speed electric motor 16. The speed of the DC motor 16 is controlled by programmed control means 24, 28 which exercise control on the basis of a comparison be tween an input from speed sensing means 26 associated with the yarn feed device and an input representative of the speed of the cylinder 20 of a circular knitting machine to which the yarn is fed. The comparison of the speed input signals is evaluated against desired speed ratio data stored in a look up table 31 in programmable memory M. Motor speed control signals output from a microprocessor unit 24 control a variable speed drive unit 28 which directly controls the speed of the motor 16.
