# Wind turbine and method for power generation.

## Abstract
This invention is relating to a wind turbine for generation of electricity comprising a large, lightweight wheel attached to a fixed vertical central pylon and oriented to rotate in a vertical plane around a boom having an axis that is substantially horizontal, and pivoted at one end to the pylon. The wind wheel is supported at its rim by a carriage assembly that is constrained to move in a circular horizontal path about the central pylon. The wheel has a cylindrical outer rim and may include one or more perimeter frame structures. The outer surface of the rim is essentially flat in cross section and presents a traction surface for the takeoff of energy from the rim of the wheel. The wheel has a plurality of uniformly spaced radial spindles on which are rolled sails soft airfoils , which when unfurled catch the wind to provide the rotational motion of the wheel. The carriage assembly may be moved around the pylon by driver means to accomodate for changes in wind direction, or the wind wheel as a whole can be allowed to move freely to assume the preferred wind direction in the manner of a weather vane. The wheel and frame structure are secured to and supports the horizontal boom which lies colinear with the axis of the wheel and projects longitudinally in both directions from the central plane of the wheel. The entire boom structure is supported by means of stays from the perimeter of the rim to the ends of the boom. Detailed rigging and traveler assemblies for control and operation of the wind turbine are disclosed.
