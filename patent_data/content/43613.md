# Polymer composition and object prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a heat resistant polymer composition based on one or more graft copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile on a rubber and a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile. This composition comprises A. A graft copolymer obtained by polymerizing 50 80 parts by weight of a monomer mixture consisting of 20 40 by weight of acrylonitrile, 50 80 by weight of styrene and 0 30 by weight of one or more other monomers in the presence of 20 50 parts by weight of rubber in respect of 100 parts by weight of graft copoly mer and B. a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile obtained by polymerizing a mixture of 60 80 parts by weight of α methylstyrene and 20 40 parts by weight of acrylonitrile, of which copolymer the spiral a flow length S is at least 65 and the flow index V 45 at most, and the ratio between spiral flow olength and the flow index is at least 3.0, and in which polymer composition 35 to 80 by weight of copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile is present.
