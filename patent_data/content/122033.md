# Composite shafts.

## Abstract
An assembly of a drive shaft of composite, fibre reinforced resin, material and a yoke member of a Hookes universal joint, the latter comprising a sheet metal element with a spigot portion 10 and two transverse tubular portions 11 which form or receive bearing elements for the universal joint. The fibres of the shaft are wound helically on the spigot portion and circumferen tially around the tubular portions of the metal element, and reinforce the latter so that it need only be of thin sheet material.
