# Rhodium catalyst regeneration by thermal treatment.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the continuous production of alkane polyols by the reaction of hydrogen and oxides of carbon in a homogeneous liquid phase mixture containing a rhodium carbonyl complex catalyst wherein the improve ment comprises periodically lowering the temperature of the liquid phase mixture and thereafter raising it to about its former value.
