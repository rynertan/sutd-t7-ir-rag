# STRUCTURAL JOINT

## Abstract
Structural joint between two structural elements of metal, one element 1 of which is provided with an elongate groove 6 and at least one flange tongue 8 extending along one or both edges of the groove, whereas the other structural element 2 is provided with an elongate protuber ance 12 fitting into said groove and having a rounded cross section. The flange tongue 8 is permanently bent around the protuberance to form the joint. In order to obtain improved strength, said one element 1 has a larger material thickness in the region of ihe bottom portion 6a of the groove than in the flange tongue.
