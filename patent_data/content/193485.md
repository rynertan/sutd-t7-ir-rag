# Load current management system for automotive vehicles.

## Abstract
A single wire power conductor 22j is connected through remote power switches 24j1,...24jn to a plurality of loads 26j,..26jn . The power conductor 22 is sized such that its current carrying capacity is less than the current required to simultaneously operate all the loads 26j1,...26jn connected thereto. Logic means are provided for delivering a control signal to the remote power switches 24j1,...24jn to selectively energize the appropriate loads. The logic means additionally includes means responding to excess current flow through the power conductor to schedule the control signals to prevent simultaneous operation of all the loads thereby limiting current flow through the power conductor to its current carrying capacity.
