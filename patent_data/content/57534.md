# Telegraphic communication system.

## Abstract
The system comprises at least one teleprinter station 1 connected to an exchange 3 by means of a transmission re ception line 2 and comprising a polarity detector 29 for the line circulating current, and a device 29 for reversing the con nection of the line wires. if the wires become connected re versely in error following maintenance work on a line of single current type, then false call and conversation signals are gene rated which automatically trigger a checking operat on in which the polarity detector is suitably examined under control of a ROM routine E controling a CPU 84. If the current is found to be the reverse of the correct current, the reversing device is operated in order to reverse the polarity of the connection. In contrast, in the case of a double current line, the reversing de vice is operated when current is absent in the reception line, this indicating an erroneous line connection. If the line current interruption is prolonged, a warning device 28 is activated.
