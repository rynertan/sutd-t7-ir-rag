# AN ELECTROLYTIC ULTRAFILTRATION APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR RECOVERING SOLIDS FROM A LIQUID MEDIUM

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for the recovery of suspended solids from a liquid medium is disclosed. The liquid medium containing suspended solids is circulated through an elec trolytic cell and an ultrafiltration unit, the suspended solids being removed from the liquid medium as a uniform particu late mass of low liquid content while a proportionate amount of the liquid and dissolved components such as surfactants is removed through ultrafiltration to avoid a dilution of the liquid medium in a continuous process. The recovered solids, fol lowing evaporation of a small amount of remaining liquid, offers a more uniform particle size as well as substantially lower recovery costs when compered with conventional techniques, such as spray drying, now used in the industry. The disclosed electroytic ultrafiltration process offers appli cation to the treatment of industrial products and wastes polymeric, e.g., PVC and PVC copolymers, rubber, paint, cel lulose, paper sludge, food, etc. and the recovery or concen trating of valuable materials from naturally occuring sources, e.g., whey protein.
