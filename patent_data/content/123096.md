# Two piece electrical socket contact assembly.

## Abstract
An annular boss 22 in the forward portion of the outer sleeve 20 of a socket contact assembly prevents the over deflection of a spring finger 11 of the inner tubular member 10 thereby minimizing the damage that may be caused by a pin type contact entering the socket contact at an angle to the central axis of the socket contact.

## Description
A TWO PIECE ELECTRICAL SOCKET CONTACT ASSEMBLY This invention relates to electrical connectors and more particularly to a two piece stamped and formed electrical socket contact assembly for use within an electrical connector. Electrical connectors generally include a plug and receptacle each having an insert of dielectric material provided with multiple openings within which respective pin and socket type electrical contacts are retained.Upon mating of the plug to the receptacle the pin type contacts are inserted into the socket type contacts which have a plurality of radially deflectable spring fingers that engage the pin contact. All too frequently during the insertion of a pin type contact into a socket type contact the contacts are not axially aligned and the pin enters the socket at an angle. In this instance the spring fingers are deflected beyond their normal range, decreasing their resiliency and their inward force on the pin contact after mating. Such an angular entry by a pin type contact may also permanently deflect a spring finger from its original position. To minimize the problem of damage to the spring fingers in a stamped and formed electrical socket contact assembly a sleeve has been placed around the fingers to protect the spring fingers. Such an arrangement is illustrated in U.S. Patent 4,120,556 entitled Electrical Contact Assembly issued October 17, 1978. In U.S. Patent 4,168,878 entitled Pin and SocketType Electrical Terminals issued September 25, 1979 an annular crimp in the outer sleeve engages the spring fingers to control the force of the fingers against a pin contact. However, with this type of arrangement, the annular boss provides a fulcrum for permanently bending the spring fingers of the socket contact. Disclosure of the Invention This invention is a stamped and formed electrical socket type contact assembly that limits or confines the deflection of the spring fingers of the socket contact when mated to a pin type contact. The invention is characterized by a two piece stamped and formed electrical socket type contact assembly having in the outer sleeve thereof an annular boss that extends inwardly and spaced from the forward half portion of the spring fingers. The boss engages the fingers if they are deflected outwardly beyond a predetermined distance. Accordingly, it is an advantage of this invention to provide a two piece stamped and formed electrical socket contact assembly that prevents the over deflection of a spring finger of the socket contact. It is another advantage of this invention to reduce the number of pieces necessary to make a stamped and formed socket contact assembly. Detailed Description of the Invention FIGURE 1 illustrates a diagramatic view of a two piece socket contact assembly incorporating the principles of this invention. FIGURE 2 illustrates a pin type contact entering the socket contact shown in FIGURE 1. FIGURE 3 illustrates a three piece contact assembly incorporating the principles of this invention mated with a pin type contact. Referring now to the drawings, FIGURE 1 illustrates a socket contact assembly comprised of a stamped and formed tubular member 10 and a sleeve 20 coaxially mounted on the tubular member 10. The tubular member 10 includes a rear wire receiving portion and a forward mating portion comprised of a plurality of resiliently deflectable spring fingers 11 adapted to mate with a pin type contact not shown . The outside portion of the rear end of the tubular member 10 includes a forwardly facing shoulder 12. The outer sleeve 20, generally comprised of a corrosion resistant material such as stainless steel, includes a rear portion an enlarged middle portion 25 having a forwardly facing shoulder 26 and a rearwardly facing shoulder 27 and a forward portion that extends beyond the forward end of the spring fingers 11 of the tubular member 10.The forward end of the outer sleeve 20 terminates in an inwardly extending annular surface 21 that forms an opening slightly larger than the opening defined by the ends of the spring fingers 11 in the tubular member 10. It is the function of the annular surface 21 to guide a pin type contact not shown into the opening defined by the ends of the spring fingers 11. To limit the outward deflection of the spring fingers 11 of the tubular member 10 the forward portion of the outer sleeve 20 includes an inwardly extending annular boss 22. Preferably, the boss 22 is located coaxially with and spaced from the spring fingers 11 somewhere along the forward half of the spring fingers. The boss 22 may be arcuately shaped or have a flat portion adapted to engage a spring finger 11 when it is deflected outwardly to limit the fingers outward movement. FIGURE 2 illustrates a pin type contact entering the socket type contact at an angle that without the boss 22 would deflect a spring finger 11 beyond its normal deflection. In this illustration the annular boss 22 prevents further outward deflection of each spring finger 11 thereby minimizing the effect that over deflection might otherwise have on the resiliency of each finger 11. FIGURE 3 illustrates a mated pin and socket type contact and the normal position of the annular boss 22 of the outer sleeve 20, which is spaced from the outside surface of fingers 11. While a preferred embodiment of this invention has been disclosed it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes may be made to the invention as set forth in the appended claims without departing from the invention, and in some instances, certain features of the invention may be used to advantage without corresponding use of other features. For example, the enlarged portion of the contact assembly may be part of the inner tubular member 10 or the outer sleeve 20 or there may be two bosses 22 instead of one. Accordingly, it is intended that the illustrative and descriptive materials herein be used to illustrate the principles of the invention and not to limit the scope thereof.
