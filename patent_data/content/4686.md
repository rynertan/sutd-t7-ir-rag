# ANTI ULCER COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Zwitterionic surfactant compounds provide effective therapy for ulceration of the gastric mucosa. The tendency of aspirin and other salicylate based drugs to cause ulceration of the gastric mucosa is also reduced by administration of such drugs in conjunction with certain zwitterionic surfactants. The ammoniohexanoate zwitterionics are especially preferred in the management of both gastric and duodenal ulcers.
