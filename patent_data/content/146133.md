# A CAPPED EYELET FOR ATTACHMENT OF A SNAP FASTENER TO A GARMENT

## Abstract
A capped eyelet 100, 100 , 100 for attachment of a snap fastener member D to a garment fabric F has a double shock absorbing means comprising a plurality of resiliently deformable buffer wings 6, 26, 36 projecting from a flange 2 of an eyelet body A, A , A and a plastically deformable buffer plate C sandwiched between the buffer wings 6, 26, 36 and a cap B covering the flange. When axial pressure is applied to the capped eyelet 100, 100 , 100 to join with the snap fastener member D in clinched condition, the buffer wings 6, 26, 36 and the buffer plate C work together to ab sorb an excessive amount of the axial pressure so as not to impair the cap B .
