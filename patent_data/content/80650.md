## Abstract
Each of two valves 16,16 disposed in a housing 14 is constructed as a unit which comprises a casing 18 in which substantially all essential parts of the valve are housed, and a plug member 30 removably connected to the casing for retaining the parts in the casing. The valve comprises a valve body 34 movably disposed in the casing, a piston 20 slidably disposed in the casing and movable in fore and aft directions in response to application of hydraulic pressure thereto to open and close, in cooperation with the valve body, the communication between inlet and outlet ports 18d,18f of the valve, and a valve seat 28 mounted to the piston for assuring the communication open end close function achieved by the valve body and the piston, wherein the valve seat has a configuration which affects the charac teristics of the piston, and the valve seat is removably connected to the piston.
