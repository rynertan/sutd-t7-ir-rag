# APPARATUS FOR CUTTING RIBBONS FROM ROLLS OF TEXTILE FABRICS MADE OF HEAT WELDABLE YARNS

## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting ribbons from rolls of textile fabrics made of heat weldable yarns is disclosed, essen tially comprising means 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 for unwinding the fabric with a controlled adjustable tension, means for con trolling and synchronizing speed of the fabric driving rollers, means 63, 64, 68 for automatic pneumatic cen tering of fabric fed to rotary cutters, means for removing electrostatic charges present on the fabric surface and finally means for controlling pick up and winding tension of the cut ribbons and selvedges. This apparatus avoids jamming and entanglement of the ribbons, does not require the constant control of an operator, carries out the cutting operation at high speed, still maintaining a high degree of precision and reliability.
