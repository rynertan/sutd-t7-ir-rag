## Abstract
A road marking strip and a road marking system with this strip for providing information to motorists on the road. The system includes the combination of transmitting and receiving active electronic components, typically second ary radar aboard the vehicle and designed for emitting energy in the direction of travel along the road, passive components which are located beneath the prefabricated strip and designed for returning said energy to the receiving components on board of the vehicle, and horizontal road marking light reflective components also formed on that strip and designed for positively providing optical informa tion to the motorist in a system as above an automatic arrangement for coding and decoding the provided informa tion operated in conjunction with active electronic com ponents on a vehicle and including synchronizing marking components, key marking components and code marking components positioned on the marking one after another.
