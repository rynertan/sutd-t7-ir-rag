## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FITMENTS FOR MOUNTING ONCOAT HANGERS This invention relates to fitments for use on coat hangers of the general kind described and claimed in United Kingdom Patent Specification 1 397 413. The said Patent Specification describes and claims a garment identification tally removably mounted on a coat hanger, said tally being generally in the form of a right cylinder, the wall or walls of which surround a hollow space, and the head of which is provided with an axial hole, through which the hook of the hanger passes, wherein the generated wall or walls of the cylinder are provided with a plurality of identification markings arranged side by side around the axis of the cylinder in such a way that at least one of said marking is visible from any angular position around said axis, and wherein the axial hole is so dimensioned in relation to the hook of the hanger that the tally rests on the shoulder of the hanger without tilting. A tally in accordance with the said Patent specification is fitted on to a coat hanger by passing the free end of the coat hanger hook through the axial hole in the tally and manoeuvring the tally round the bends in the hook until it rests on the shoulder of the hanger. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fitment which does not need to be or, in certain cases indeed, cannot be, threaded on to the hook. From one aspect the present invention consists in a fitment for mounting on a coat hanger, said fitment being generally in the form of a right cylinder having a head and consisting of two portions hingedly connected one to the other along a hinge axis located in the, or a, generated wall of the cylinder, wherein each portion of the said head is provided with a recess adapted, when the two hinged portions are adjacent to one another, to form an axial hole and wherein locking means are provided to maintain said hinged portions adjacent to one another, with the hook of the hanger passing through said axial hole. One embodiment of the invention is used as a garment identification tally. In this embodiment, as in the case of a tally in accordance with said Patent Specification, the generated wall, or walls, of the cylinder is, or are, provided with a plurality of identification markings arranged side by said around the axis of the cylinder normally in such a way that at least one of said markings is visible from any angular position around said axis.In some cases it may be sufficient to provide two identification markings, but normally it will be preferred that three or four identification markings should be provided. Alternatively, or in addition, identification may be provided, or assisted, by colour coding of the material of which the tally is made. If desired, the right cylinder may have a base as well as a head and, in this case, each portion of said base, as well as each portion of the head, is provided with a substantially semi circular recess adapted, when the two hinged portions are adjacent to one another, to form an axial hole through which the hook of the coat hanger can pass. The fitment may also be provided with an intermediate platform located mid way between said head and said base. In this case, each portion of the platform is also provided with a semi circular recess and, when the two hinged portions of the tally are adjacent to one another, the two semi circular recesses in the platform form an axial hole similar to the axial holes in the head and the base. In another embodiment of the invention the right cylinder has no base.However in this case it is still possible to provide the intermediate platform. As in the case of the embodiment having the head, the base and the intermediate platform, the intermediate platform consists of two portions, each of which is provided with a recess arranged so that, when the two hinged portions are adjacent to one another, the two recesses in the platform form a hole, coaxial with the hole in the head. In some cases it is desirable that the fitment should not be removable from the hook of the hanger without being destroyed in the process. This is particularly the case when the fitment is used as a garment identification tally. In certain uses of the tally it may suffer from the disadvantage that it can be removed from the hook of the hanger by children, staff or anyone else who cares to tamper with it. Thus, in this case, the tally is designed so that it cannot be manoeuvred round the bends in the hook, and the locking means are arranged so that, once they have been engaged, they cannot be disengaged without destroying the fitment. It is to be understood that it will normally be impossible to manoeuvre the tally round the bends if the tally is provided with a base, or an intermediate platform, as well as a head. This is particularly the case if the tally has both a base and an intermediate platform. In other uses of a fitment in accordance with the invention it can be advantageous to design the fitment so that it is removable, and hence re usable. For this purpose the locking means are modified in such a way that the two hinged portions can be separated, if so desired, although they are normally held sufficiently firmly together to retain the fitment on the hook of the hanger. Alternatively, or in addition, if the base and the intermediate platform are omitted, it is possible to remove the fitment by manoeuvring it round the bends in the hook. As has already been mentioned, one use for a fitment in accordance with the invention is as a garment identification tally. However fitments in accordance with the invention are not limited to that particular use. In particular it has been found that, with the very narrow profile coat hangers which are now sometimes used, the spacing between garments hung on a series of coat hangers on a rail is insufficient for the garments to hang free of each other and hence bunching can occur which can cause the garments to crease unduly. Accordingly, in these circumstances, a fitment in accordance with the present invention may be used solely to provide adequate separation between adjacent coat hangers on a garment rail. Preferably the diameter of each hole in the head, and also of the holes in the base and the intermediate platform when provided, is substantially equal to the diameter of the hook of the hanger with which the tally is to be used, so that once the two portions of the tally have been locked into their adjacent position the tally grips the hook firmly. Preferably a tally in accordance with the invention is made of synthetic resin material, for example polypropylene. The use of synthetic resin material enables the hinge between the two portions to consist of a thin web of the same material so that the two portions can be moulded in a single operation. The locking means may comprise a pin projecting from one portion and a recess provided in the other portion. The pin may be held in the recess solely because it is a friction fit, but preferably the free end of the pin is provided with a barb, or the like, which engages in a slot in the recess so that, once the shoulders of the barb have engaged in the slot, the two portions cannot be separated without breaking the barb or the pin. Preferably the head and the base of the tally are circular, and each of the two portions is semi circular. A tally in accordance with the invention which is designed so that, once it has been fitted on to a hanger, it cannot be removed therefrom without being destroyed, is particularly suitable for use with disposable hangers, i.e. hangers which are given away with the garment which is displayed thereon in a shop or the like. One way at the present time of marking disposable hangers is to attach an adhesive label thereto. A tally in accordance with the invention is easier to apply to a hanger than an adhesive label and, in addition, it is a better visual aid for the customer than an adhesive label. In particular a tally in accordance with the invention is located above the garment on the hanger, whereas the adhesive label may be obscured by the collar of the garment. The invention will now be more particularly described in connection with the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a tally in accordance with the invention in the open position in which it is manufactured Figure 2 is a perspective view of the tally illustrated in Figure 1 after it has been mounted on the hook of a coat hanger Figure 3 is a scrap view, partly in section, showing the locking device of the tally illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is a scrap view, partly in section, showing the hinge of the tally illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3, andFigure 5 is a scrap view, partly in section, of a modification of the locking means illustrated in Figure 3. In the tally illustrated in Figures 1 to 4, the body consists of two generally semi circular portions 1 and 2. The portion 1 has a semi circular head 3, a semi circular base 4 and a semi circular intermediate platform 5. Similarly the portion 2 has a semi circular head 6, a semi circular base 7 and a semi circular intermediate platform 8. Each of the heads, bases and intermediate platforms is provided with a semi circular recess, of which two are indicated at 9 and 10. The two portions 1 and 2 are interconnected by a web 11 which constitutes a hinge. Further, the intermediate platform 5 is provided with a projecting pin 12, and the intermediate platform 8 is provided with a recess 13. As can be seen from Figure 2, when the tally is in use, the two portions are clipped together around the hook 14 of a coat hanger 15. The wall of each of the portions 1 and 2 is provided with two identification markings, of which two can be seen at 16 and 17. As can be seen from Figure 3, the free end of the pin 12 is generally conical, and forms a barb 18 having a shoulder 19. When the two portions are locked together, as shown in Figure 3, the shoulder 19 is retained in a slot 20. The modified locking means illustrated in Figure 5 again consists basically of a recess 13 in the portion 2 and a projecting pin 12 forming part of the portion 1. However, in the present instance, the diameter of the pin 12 is less than the diameter of the recess 13 except that the pin 12 is provided with an enlarged portion 21, while the recess 13 is provided with a portion of reduced diameter 22. The edges of the portions 21 and 22 are curved so that the pin 12 can readily be pushed into the recess 13 so that the enlarged portion 21 passes the portion 22. In this position which is illustrated in Figure 3 the two hinged portions of the fitment are held securely together. However, because of the curved profiles of the portions 21 and 22, and the nature of the material of the fitment, the two hinged portions can be separated if sufficient force is applied thereto without damaging the fitment, and in particular without breaking the pin 12 away from the portion 1. Thus, if desired, the fitment can readily be removed from one coat hanger and clipped on to another hanger. While the invention has been illustrated in connection with a tally having a circular head and a circular base it is, of course, to be understood that, as in the case of the tally described and claimed in the said Patent Specification, the head and base may have any desired shape. In particular the head and base may be square, and in this case the hinge is preferably provided in one of the corners of the squares so that the two portions of the head and the base will be in the form of isosceles triangles. The invention has also been illustrated in connection with a tally having a base and an intermediate platform as well as a head. However, as already explained, it is to be understood that the base or the intermediate platform, or the base and the intermediate platform, may be omitted in certain embodiments of the invention.
