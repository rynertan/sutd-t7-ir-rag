## Description
A derivative of theonyl thio propionyl glycine and process for the preparation thereof oOoooooooo The present invention relates to a stable derivative of 2 d theonyl thio thiopropionyl glycine, hereinafter shortly indicated by theonyl thio propionyl glycine , namely the salt of DL lysine, having the formula EMI1.1 The theonyl thio propionyl glycine, as the soluble sodium salt, is endowed with optimum expectorant properties and thus with interesting therapeutical prospects.However, it is a highly hygroscopic compound, the chemical isolation of which is particularly difficult even the lyophilization treatment gives place to a little stable product, which is readily degradable mainly due to the high hygroscopicity.There are thus evident the problems raised by this compound under the point of view of the industrial handling and of the use.It has been now found that the salt of theonyl thio propionyl glycine with DL lysine is not hygroscopic, whereby the above mentioned problem is wholly solved without interferring with or affecting the therapeutical properties of the basic active principle.It is a compound having melting point of 173 1750C, which is a white, microcrystalline powder, completely soluble in water, whereby no problems exist as regards the preparation of the several pharmaceutical forms.For the preparation of the compound of the invention, a process is foreseen according to which theonyl thio propionyl glycine and DL lysine are reacted in stechiometric ratio, in alcoholic solvent and at a temperature of 20 500C. The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting purpose. EXAMPLE 1 5.4 g of theonyl thio propionyl glycine 0.02 moles are charged in a becker there being orderly added 40 mls of isopropyl alcohol and 5.6 g of 50 DL lysine base 0.02 moles .The temperature of the reaction mixture is brought te 400C and the reaction takes place with conversion of the mass without a complete phase and with precipitation of the reaction product.The reaction mixture is very slowly filtered, due to the presence of swollen crystals and dried in an oven. 1 g of product are obtained, having melting point of 173 185 C. EXAMPLE 2The process of example 1 is repeated, except that the reaction solvent is in this case ethanol 50 mix , it being added to the reaction mixture in two steps, namely 10 mls at the beginning and the remaining 40 mis after the lysine addition.In this case the reaction product crystallizes and there are obtained 6 g dry of crystalline product, which under thin layer chromatography appears as a pure compound.EXAMPLE 3The process of example 1 is repeated, except that methanol 50 mls is used as the reaction solvent.In this case the product does not crystallize and for the crystallization 20 mls of isopropyl alcohol must be added.
