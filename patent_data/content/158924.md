# Neon sign control device.

## Abstract
In a neon sign control device. a.c. power of an a.c. power source 17 is connected to a neon transformer 11 through an electronic switching element 16 , a control signal from a control signal generator 24 is supplied to a trigger cuircuit 22 , the trigger circuit generates a trigger signal while the control signal is supplied, the electronic switching element is rendered on by the trigger signal, thereby a.c. power is supplied to the neon transformer, and neon tubes 21 1, ..., 21 n connected to a secondary winding 18 of the neon transformer are lit. A control unit composed of at least the electronic switching element and the trigger circuit is installed inside or outside of the transformer housing 12 or disposed near the housing.
