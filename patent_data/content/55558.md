## Abstract
An insulating film 23 of a higher dielectric constant than silicon dioxide, for example of tantalum oxide, is formed on a p type substrate 21 . The insulating film 23 contains an n type impurity, for example phosphorus. An electrode 24 , for example of molybdenum silicide, is formed on the insulating film 23 . By a heat treatment carried out for example for 30 minutes at a temperature of 1000 C an n type region 25 is formed in the p type substrate 21 by diffusion of impurity phosphorus from the insulat ing film 23 into the surface of the substrate 21 . Thereby an MIS type capacitor can be provided in which the insulating film 23 has a higher dielectric constant than silicon dioxide, whereby an increased amount of electric charge can be held in a capacitor of the same size as one in which an insulating film is provided of silicon dioxide. By the provision of the n type inversion region 25 the capacitor can be charged up to the voltage of the power source connected to the electrode 24 . By the diffusion of impurities from the insulating film 23 into the substrate 21 to form the region 25 , the region 25 is formed in an accurate self aligning fashion.
