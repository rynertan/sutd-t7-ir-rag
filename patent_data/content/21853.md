# Self scanned arrays of photosensors.

## Abstract
A photosensor array with single transfer register 36 and individual transfer gates 39 for conducting signal packets derived from the photosensors 12 of the array to the transfer register phase gates. The number of phase gates of the transfer register is equal to the number of photosensors that comprise the array, and to ensure at least two phase gates for each photosensor signal packet, a ring counter 40 is provided to sequentially trigger each transfer gate, operation of the ring counter being integrated with shift register clock drive pulses 1, 2 to shift the signals transferred to the shift register and enable the required plural phase gates at the instant of transfer. The aforedescribed array permits multiple arrays to be constructed on a common substrate with the array photosensors in face to face relationship.
