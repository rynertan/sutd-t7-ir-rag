# Display terminal.

## Abstract
In a display terminal coupled to a computer and including a plurality of user interrupt devices for interactive communi cation with the computer, an apparatus for signaling to the user when the computer responds to a user interrupt com prises a counter 20 arranged to measure a specified period of time by counting down to zero from an initial count value loaded from a register 21 , a sensor 14 triggered by the generation of an interrupt to cause the counter 20 to begin measurement of the said specified period of time 21 , and a further sensor 15 coupled to an alarm 23 via a logic gate 24 to provide an audible signal only when the period of time between the generation of the interrupt and the computer response exceeds the specified period of time measured by the counter.
