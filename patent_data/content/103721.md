# Coupling device.

## Abstract
A coupling device for establishing an adjustment elec trically conductive connection between two members of an electrical installation comprises a ball member 17 which is axially adjustable on a coupling rod 19 and is formed with a radial slot 20 to enable it to be clamped onto the rod by the application of a clamping force exerted on the ball member 17 by means of clamping elements 21,22 which afford seatings 25,26 engaging the part spherical surface of the ball member in such a manner as to permit universal adjustment, bolts 28 being provided to draw the plates towards one another so as on the one hand to apply clamping pressure to the ball member 17 thereby to clamp the latter onto the rod at an adjustable axial position and on the other hand to clamp themselves onto the ball member at a universally adjustable position in one and the same operation.
