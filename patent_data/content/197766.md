## Description
CATALYTIC ASYMMETRIC EPOXIDATION The synthetic production of a wide variety of drugs and naturally occurring products is dependent upon the introduction of an oxygen functionality at a particular site. Frequently, the oxygen functionality may be associated with a second functionality in the vicinal position. For many compounds of interest, one or both of these sites may be chiral. The epoxide functionality is a particularly attractive functionality for providing the two substituents.Furthermore, where the epoxide can be provided as a particular enantiomer or diastereomer, by appropriate selection of reagents and conditions, one can provide for the correct stereoisomers at the two positions.There is, therefore, substantial interest in ways to prepare epoxides in high yield providing for asymmetric formation of the epoxide. U.S. Patent No. 4,471,130 describes asymmetric epoxidation of ethylenic alcohols employing, for the most part, stoichiometric amounts of metal alkoxide catalyst. Numerous other articles have been published employing the process described in the above cited U.S. patent, using a wide variety of olefinic alcohols for epoxide formation, substantially following the stoichiometric conditions described in the cited patent. The disclosure of U.S. Patent No.4,471,130 and corresponding EP A 46033 is incorporated herein by reference its entirety. Olefinic alcohols are asymmetrically epoxidized employing an organic hydroperoxide, a glycol related titanium catalyst, where the glycol is optically active, and the olefinic alcohol, in an inert organic solvent, under conditions where the catalyst and reaction mixture are maintained substantially anhydrous by a dehydrating environment and hydrolysis of the epoxide and or catalyst is inhibited. The invention provides methods and compositions for preparing epoxides of olefinic alcohols asymmetrically, where the olefin is from 0 to 1 carbon atoms from the carbinol carbon atom. The olefinic alcohol can vary widely, being at least three carbon atoms and not more than about 60 carbon atoms, more usually not more than about 36 carbon atoms. However, polymers of allylic or homoallylic alcohols may be employed where some or a plurality of the olefinic groups may be epoxidized in accordance with the subject invention. The olefinic alcohol may be aliphatic, alicyclic, aralkyl or heterocyclic substituted alkyl or heterocyclic, where the heteroatoms do not interfere with the reaction, such as oxy ether, sulfone, polysubstituted amino, usually 3 to 4 substituents, or the like. The allylic groups may be mono , di , tri or tetra substituted ethylenes with aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic groups, particularly aliphatic and alicyclic groups, and the olefin may be exocyclic or endocyclic. For the most part, the substrates will have the following partial formula EMI2.1 wherein where one of the atoms bonded to the carbinol carbon will usually be hydrogen n is 0 to 1 T can be any inert group, free of active functionalities such as basic amines and acidic groups and G is an olefinic group and may be 60 carbon atoms or more, more usually not more than about 30 carbon atoms and is bonded through an olefinic carbon atom. In view of the enormous diversity of carbinols which may be employed as substrates, only various classes of products of interest can be suggested as useful in the subject process, either for synthesis of a particular product, for preparing an intermediate, or for modification of an existing product, particularly a natural product. The subject invention can be used in organic synthesis of enantiomers, both for introduction of a variety of functionalities in a synthetic procedure and optical resolution of an enantiomer from a racemic mixture. The sole requirements for use of the subject invention and syntheses and or resolution are the presence of 1 an hydroxyl group 2 a chiral or prochiral center, which may or may not involve the carbinol carbon and 3 an olefin. General classes of compounds of interest include steroids, lipids, prostaglandins, terpenoids, hormones, saccharides, CNS drugs, a and ss adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrythmic drugs, vasodilator drugs, analgesics, antibiotics, and the like. Of particular interest are those compounds which have a three carbon unit, where the three carbon unit includes at least two oxy functionalities, at least one of which has a chiral carbon, and the third carbon may lack a heterofunctionality, or have a heterofunctionality, such as amino, thio, or the like. The catalyst which is employed is extensively described in U.S Patent 4,471,130. For the subject invention, the catalyst will employ quadrivalent titanium Ti 4 chelated with an asymmetric glycol, where the glycol may be substituted with heteroatom containing functionalities or unsubstituted with heteroatom containing functionalities. The glycol will be at least 4 carbon atoms and may be up to about 36 carbon atoms, usually not more than about 30 carbon atoms, and preferably not more than about 20 carbon atoms. Of particular interest as the glycol are derivatives of tartaric acid, both esters and amides, where the esters may have alkoxy groups of from 1 to 12, usually 1 to 6, more usually 1 to 3 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, ethyl and isopropyl, and the amides may have unsubstituted, mono or disubstituted amino groups, where the substituents on the nitrogen may be from about 1 to 12 carbon atoms, usually from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more usually from about 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The glycol should be free of groups which interfere with the reaction, groups which react with the peroxide under the conditions of the epoxidation, groups which might displace the asymmetric glycol from the titanium, or the like. In addition to the glycol, alkoxides are employed having a single oxy functionality linked to titanium, where the alkoxide will normally be non chiral and free of functionalities which might interfere with the reaction. For the most part, the alkoxides will be aliphatic alcohols of from 1 to 12, generally of from 1 to 6, and preferably of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the alkoxides will be relatively bulky, being branched at the a carbon atom, normally having from 1 to 2 branches. Particularly preferred is isopropoxide and tert. butoxide. It should be clearly understood that the alkanols are primarily chosen for convenience and any alkanol may be employed, so long as the substituents on the alkanol do not interfere with the course of the reaction. The preparation of the catalyst is conventional and can be performed in situ. For example, an alkoxide substituted dihalo metal may be combined with the chiral glycol, as a metal dialkoxide, e.g., lithium or sodium, in an inert polar solvent and the product separated from the inorganic salt. More conveniently, the titanium tetraalkoxide may be combined with the chiral glycol in approximately stoichiometric amounts in an inert solvent. There is no requirement that the alcohol which is formed be removed, although it may be removed, for example, by distillation. The hydroperoxides which are employed for the epoxidation may be aliphatic, alicyclic, or aralkyl hydroperoxides, preferably being tertiary hydroperoxides, more preferably having at least two aliphatic carbon atoms bonded to the carbon bonded to the hydroperoxide group The hydroperoxide will generally be from about 3 to 20 carbon atoms, more usually from about 3 to 12 carbon atoms, particularly hydroperoxides having acceptable thermostability. Illustrative hydroperoxides include t. butyl hydroperoxide, a,a dimethylheptyl hydroperoxide, bis diisobutyl 2,5 dihydroperoxide, l methylcyclohexyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, and trityl hydroperoxide. As the reaction medium, inert solvents will be employed, particularly halohydrocarbon solvents of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 2 carbon atoms. A solvent which has been found to be quite satisfactory is methylene dichloride. All of the materials employed should be substantially free of water prior to being added to the reaction mixture. In addition, water formation and accumulation should be inhibited by the rapid removal of any water which may form in the reaction mixture. The removal of water can be achieved in a variety of ways. Water can be directly removed by adding to the reaction mixture various reagents which will strongly bind water, so as to substantially remove its activity as a hydrolyzing agent, while not interfering in the course of the reaction. Conveniently, zeolites may be employed as a powder or small particles which may be introduced in the mixture in sufficient amount to absorb any of the water which is formed. Zeolites of interest include zeolite 3A, zeolite 4A, and zeolite 5A. Other dehydrating agents may also find use, such as silica gel, alumina, orthoesters, e.g., carbonates, amide acetals, e.g., dimethyl formamide dimethyl acetal, and the like. Any material which can serve to bind the water, so as to substantially inhibit its reactivity, while not interfering with the course of the reaction may be employed in the reaction mixture.Alternatively, a device such as a Soxhlet extractor may be employed, where the water containing solvent is continuously vaporized, condensed and passed through a dehydrating medium. Mild conditions will normally be employed, with temperatures below about 80QC, usually below about 300C, and generally in the range of about 100 to 200C, more usually in the range of about S00 to 10 0C. The reaction is desirably carried out under an inert atmosphere, conveniently nitrogen. In carrying out the epoxidation, the dehydrating agent will be added prior to the occurrence of any significant amount of reaction. For best results the dehydrating agent is introduced prior to or at the beginning of the catalyst preparation. It is found that rates of epoxidation are enhanced by preparation of the catalyst in the presence of the dehydrating agent. The amount of dehydrating agent to be employed will vary with the choice and manner of dehydration and may be determined empirically. The amount of dehydrating agent employed may vary from 5 to 1000, usually from about 100 to 500 weight percent based on catalyst. All of the dehydrating agent may be added initially or portions may be added from time to time. The titanium catalyst can be pre prepared or conveniently prepared in situ. In preparing the catalyst, the titanium alkoxide is combined with the chiral glycol in a dry inert solvent, preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent, at a temperature below about 300C and in about stoichiometric proportions, although small excesses, generally less than about 100, usually less than about 50 mole percent excess, of the chiral glycol may be employed. The reaction is then allowed to proceed for a sufficient time for the catalyst to form. Particularly, titanium tetraisopropoxide may be combined with tartrate diester, diamide or half ester amide. Usually, the reaction forming the catalyst is complete in less than about 30min, more usually in less than about 15min. The time is not critical and can be optimized for a particular set of conditions and materials. The amount of catalyst employed will generally be less than about 25 mole percent based on olefinic alcohol, more usually less than about 20 percent and usually in excess of about 1 percent, generally from about 3 to 12 mole percent, more usually from about 5 to 10 mole percent. The hydroperoxide is normally added in at least stoichiometric amount based on total olefinic alcohol, and preferably in excess, usually at least 25 percent excess, more usually at least 50 percent excess and not more than about 500 percent excess, that is, about 1 to 5 equivalents, preferably from about 1 to 2 equivalents of the hydroperoxide will be used per olefin equivalent. Of particular interest is the use of either tert. butyl hydroperoxide or aralkyl t. hydroperoxide, e.g., cumene hydroperoxide, the latter finding particular use with low molecular weight olefinic alcohols. The concentrations of the various materials may be varied widely, the olefinic alcohol normally being from about 0.005 to about 2M, preferably being from about 0.05 to 1M. The concentrations of the other reactants will be related accordingly. The hydroperoxide reacts with the catalyst in a reaction which is usually complete in less than about lhr, usually less than about 30min. The order of addition is not critical, so that the hydroperoxide and olefinic carbinol can be added consecutively in any order or concurrently. Where the hydroperoxide is added initially, the olefinic carbinol may be added after completion of the reaction between the catalyst and hydroperoxide. After all the reactants have been combined in the inert medium in the presence of the dehydrating agent, the reaction is continued until the substrate has been transformed to the desired degree. The rate of the reaction varies depending upon the conditions and the amount of material involved and may vary from a few minutes to a few days. By employing continuous dehydration premature deactivation of the catalyst is prevented, rates are accelerated, so that shorter times are required than when carrying out the reaction in the absence of continual dehydration, even in the presence of higher amounts of catalyst. Reactions are frequently complete within about 2 to 3hr at 200C. After completion of the reaction, the reaction may be worked up in a variety of conventional ways. The catalyst may be destroyed using a mildly acidic or basic aqueous solution and where the epoxidized olefin is in the organic layer, the organic layer is isolated, dried, and the product isolated.For water soluble products, salting out, extraction, chromatography or distillation may be required.Purification of the product may then be carried out in accordance with conventional means. If desired, the epoxide may be further reacted to form the monoester. By employing an acylating agent, e.g., carboxylating, sulfonylating, etc., which has been or is activated, e.g., acyl halide or anhydride in the presence of a tertiary amine, at temperatures in the range of about 50 to 200C, the monoester epoxide may be obtained. The product may then be isolated by conventional work up. Alternatively, the epoxide ring may be opened by employing a combination of a nucleophile and at least a stoichiometric amount of a metal ester, e.g., titanate, zirconate, etc., particularly aliphatic esters, more particularly alkyl esters. The metal esters provide for improved regioselectivity. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions, generally from about 20 to 800C, usually from about 0 to 400C. The nucleophile will usually be in greater than stoichiometric amount, usually at least l fold excess. Nucleophiles include halide ions, amines, azide, mercaptans, mercaptides, selenides, cyanide, carboxylates, alkoxides, phenoxides, or the like. Various organic solvents may be employed, both polar and non polar. Enhanced regioselectivity is achieved, with opening preferably occurring at the 3 carbon atom from the hydroxyl of the glycidyl alcohol. Prior to the epoxide opening, any hydroperoxide present may be destroyed, using various conventional reagents The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTALExample 1 Exemplary Reactions, Reagents and Equipment 1 All glass equipment was flame dried under vacuum just prior to use, however this was found generally not to be necessary. 2 Molecular sieves used in the reaction were of commercial grade, purchased as the activated 4A or unactivated 3A 2 3 powder Aldrich .Molecular sieves used for storage or drying of solvents were in the pellet form Linde . Activation of the unactive molecular sieves was accomplished by heating at 250 3000 for several hours under O.05mm pressure. 3 The dichloromethane used as reaction solvent was generally freshly distilled from calcium hydride prior to use, however this was observed to be necessary only for small scale lOmmol reactions. 4 Dialkyl tartrate was distilled, stored under argon or nitrogen, and dispensed by gastight syringe. 5 Titanium IV isopropoxide was of commercial grade and dispensed by gastight syringe. 6 Tert. butyl hydroperoxide TBHP was used as a 50 solution in dichloromethane, prepared from 70 aqueous TBHP by dilution with dichloromethane, phase separation, azeotropic removal of water, and sequential drying over molecular sieves.

The mixture was stirred under nitrogen at 3i20 until analysis by GPLC carbowax capillary, 70 indicated 95 reaction 5h . The reaction was quenched by adding citric acid lug in ether 100 to 200mL . The cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred for 20 30min.After filtration through a pad of diatomaceous earth, the filtrate was concentrated and distilled at reduced pressure to give glycidol 0.065mol 65 , containing a small amount of cumene .Example 4 In situ opening of glycidol by benzenethiol The asymmetric epoxidation was performed in exactly the same way as described above using 0.55mL of allyl alcohol 8mmol .

The mixture was stirred vigorously until two clear phases formed lhr . Phase separation, extraction with ethyl acetate and chromatographic purification provided S 3 phenylthio 1,2 propanediol as a white solid 1.290g, 88t, mp 79 81 , 89 ee .Example 5 In situ opening of glyciol by l naphthol synthesis of S propranolol The asymmetric epoxidation was performed in exactly the same way as described above using 6.8mL of allyl alcohol O.lmol .

Phase separation, extraction, and concentation gave a crude oil, which was dissolved in 150mL of ether and treated with 100mL of 1N aqueous sodium hydroxide 45min at room temperature . Phase separation, extraction, and concentration provided crude S 3 1 naphthoxy 1,2 propanediol, which was carried on by known methods Iriuchijima and Kojima, Agric. Biol. Chem. 1982 46 1153 to give crude S propranolol hydrochloride 21.63g, 73.2 from allyl alcohol .

By ensuring the substantial absence of water during the course of the reaction, so that any water formed in situ is rapidly removed, the rate of the reaction is enhanced, yields and enantiomeric efficiencies are improved, and greatly improved results are obtained with the small olefinic alcohols which give water soluble epoxy alcohols. Furthermore, the isolation procedures are greatly simplified due to the much smaller amounts of tartrate ester and titanium containing compounds which must be removed at the end of the reaction. Thus, by using inexpensive reagents, such as molecular sieves or their equivalent, great economies are achieved in the epoxidation of a wide variety of olefinic alcohols. In this manner, the utility of the patented epoxidation method is greatly expanded, so as to be applied to a wide variety of syntheses, which would not otherwise be economical. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced.
