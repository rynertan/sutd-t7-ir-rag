# Electroluminescent device method and product.

## Abstract
A method of electroluminescent panel manufacture in which a doped zinc chalcogenide phospher film for example manganese doped zinc sulphide, is deposited upon an elec trode bearing substrate in the presence of an hydrogen enriched atmosphere for example a 90 10 argon hyd rogen atmosphere. This is followed by rapid anneal treat ment, the substrate being raised quickly to a temperature of 450 C, or greater, and cooled rapidly. It is preferable that, prior to film deposition, the substrate is pretreated by baking in the hydrogen enriched atmosphere. An additional current density limiting film may be applied a film of low resistance cermet material for example silica nickel 20 Ni in SiOâ‚‚, or a film of amorphous silicon.
