# Method of making a container or other article.

## Abstract
A laminate consists of a layer of foamed plastics having a low degree of expansion, and one or two layers of solid i.e. non porous plastics. Disposable cups are made by deform ing that laminate by a thermoforming process. The laminate can be made by co extrusion of a first flow comprising a resin and a blowing agent, and of a second flow comprising a resin. The laminate may also be put to a range of other uses.

## Description
LIN PAC PLASTIC CONTAINERS LIMITEDContainers and Material suitable for making them. Disposable cups for hot drinks, and containers for hot snack foods such as noodles, need to provide insulation between the contents and the user s hand. A need for insulation also arises in disposable containers for other purposes, for example for ice cream. Currently, disposable cups for hot drinks, available on the British market, are mainly of three kinds A. With a thin sheet wall ribbed so as to reduce the contact with the user s fingers B. With two thin sheet walls, one within the other C. With a wall of expanded polystyrene. Cups A are the cheapest, but provide limited insulation, and they are liable to shrink visibly if boiling water is poured into them. Cups B provide good insulation but are costly to make. They also are liable to shrink. Cups C provide very good insulation, but are costly to make, because the material is foamed actually in the mould which shapes the cup. The cycle of manufacture of one cup is much longer than the cycle of the thermoforming process commonly used to make cups A and the two components of cups B. Cups C also have a considerable stacking height when assembled in a stack. According to one aspect of the present invention, containers are made by a thermoforming process from a novel sheet material. According to a further aspect of the present invention, this novel material is a laminate and consists of a layer of foamed plastics having a low degree of expansion, and one or two layers of solid i.e. non porous plastics. Preferably, the laminate is made by a process of co extrusion. In this process, a single extruding head having a slit shaped outlet receives two flows of material. One flow comprises a resin and a blowing agent which react within a heated housing, preferably containing a feed screw. The other flow comprises a resin. The flows are directed so that they emerge from the outlet as superimposed layers, each layer being of substantially uniform thickness. As an example, to make a laminate of two layers the rates of supply of raw material may be Constituents of foam layer Resin high impact polystyrene 680 kg hr. Blowing Agent Hoechst VN 22621 4 0.68 kg hr.Constituent of solid layer Resin crystal G.P. pdlystyrene 68 kg hr. The laminate is produced in a width of 107 to 184 cm. The thickness of the laminate i.e. the total of the thicknesses of its two constituent layers is 1.2 mm.Each square metre weighs 1045.3g. The bulk density of the laminate considered as a whole is about 0.967g cm3. This is to be contrasted with the bulk density of solid sheet polystyrene, which is about 1.069g cm3. It will be apparent that the degree of expansion in the foam layer is very low in fact the volume of the pores is considerably less than the volume of the plastics in the foam layer. We have found that the laminate can be thermoformed in apparatus substantially identical to that used to manufacture Cups A mentioned above, and under very similar operating conditions. Preferably, as in the example above, the laminate has foam exposed on one face, and solid plastics exposed on the other face. Preferably an antistatic agent is applied, immediately after extrusion, to whichever face is to become the outside of the container. In making a disposable drinking cup, the solid plastics is preferably towards the interior of the cup, so that the solid plastics is on the exposed surface of the usual outwardly curled rim of the cup. This is comfortable for a user, and provides strength and good dimensional precision, which are needed in cups to be used in vending machines. We have found that the laminate can be deformed by the thermoforming process, to the extent required to make a cup with a mouth diameter to depth ratio of about 1 1.5, without any localised weakening of the cup. This behaviour is in contrast with existing experience in making containers by deformation of foamed plastics sheet. Such sheet is typically 1.6 mm. thick, and the volume of pores in the foam is greater than the volume of plastics in the foam. This sheet cannot be deeply drawn. It is successfully used to make shallow trays for use in packaging of meat portions. Such sheet cannot be used to make cups as stated above, Cups C are foamed in moulds individually. We have found that disposable cups according to this invention do not visibly shrink when filled with boiling water. We believe that the explanation is that the insulating properties of the cup ensure that the outer part of the thickness of the wall remains at a sufficiently lo temperature to retain adequate strength, Although of particular interest for use where insulating properties are of value, containers according to the invention also have the property that, as compared with solid wall containers, they have greater rigidity for a given weight of material in the container wall. The invention is therefore applicable, for example, to flower pots. Although the laminates have been developed as a starting material for the manufacture of containers, they are themselves novel products, which may be put to a range of other uses. Examples are As starting material for the manufacture of disposable plates As backing for wallpaper As underlay for table cloths or place mats. The thermal properties of the laminate, and of containers and other. articles formed from it, can be controlled by control of the thickness of the layers and of the degree of expansion of the foam. The plastics in the two layers are preferably the same, as this facilitates the reclaiming of scrap portions of sheet produced during manufacture of articles, but different plastics may be used. In either case, the plastics may be of the same colour or of different colours.
