# Video map display.

## Abstract
Map frames are stored on a video storage medium such as video disc, and a graphics generator stores overlay information such as the location of telephone lines plant. To accommodate maps of different scales covering the same area, the graphics generator applies a corresponding scaling factor to generation of the overlay image, for accurate superimposition on the map. Provision may also be made for correcting inaccuracies in the original process of recording the map frames.
