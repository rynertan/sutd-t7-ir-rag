# Separator for use in boreholes of limited diameter.

## Abstract
A separator, for use in boreholes of limited diameter, having a vortex chamber 40 adapted to be received in the borehole having upper 42 and lower 43 ends and including a sidewall constituting a surface of revolution a tubular vortex finder 60 concentrically disposed in the upper end of the chamber defining an annular throat therebetween a swirling chamber 70 interconnecting the upper end of the vortex chamber and the vortex finder and providing a surface of revolu tion of larger diameter than the vortex chamber disposed con centrically thereabout and an axially facing, swirl inducing inlet extended outwardly of the chamber to admit fluid from the borehole into the swirling chamber and through the throat for centrifuging flow in the vortex chamber.
