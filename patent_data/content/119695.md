# Switch key assembly having improved switch actuation.

## Abstract
Switch key 2 comprises a frame 24 having a frame column 36 and a plunger 26 guided by the column. A re turn spring 30 biases the plunger to its extended position. When the plunger is depressed, a switch actuator 32 is moved against the switch contacts adjacent to the frame 24 to close the switch. The switch actuator comprises a bell crank 76 pivoted to the frame and having a contact arm 70 which closes the switch and a cam follower arm 68 . The cam follower arm is cammed by the plunger 26 to close the switch when the plunger is depressed.
