# A framework structure.

## Abstract
The connector comprises a body 10 , a first group of at least four projections 16 which extend outwardly from the body in a common plane. A second group of at least four projections 20 extend outwardly from the body at an angle of between 15 and 75 to the aforesaid plane and preferably at 45 to said plane. The projections of each group are equi angularly spaced about an axis 18 normal to said plane and the projections 20 of the second group are angularly staggered by half the angle between adjacent projections of the first group about said axis relative to the projections 16 of the first group. Each projection is of non circular and preferably triangular cross section and the body 10 and projections 16, 20 are made of non flexible plastics material. Such connectors are used to connect together elongate members having tubular ends at least to form a frame work structure.
