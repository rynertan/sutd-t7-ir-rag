# Grinding tube mill.

## Abstract
A grinding tube mill has a composite diaphragm 5 at the outlet end of a grinding chamber 3 . The diaphragm comprises a combination of a coarse grate 6 facing the grinding chamber 3 for retaining grinding bodies in the chamber, and, on the side of the grate remote from the chamber, a sieving screen 7 for sieving the ground product. The coarse grate has a plurality of openings 20 which constitute substantially the effective open area of the coarse grate. The intermediate space between the coarse grate and the sieving screen contains guiding members 21, 22 to guide coarse particles backwards to the grinding chamber 3 through one or more apertures 19 in the coarse grate allowing free passage of the coarse particles.
