## Description
The present invention relates generally to DC stabilization systems for use in color television receivers, and particularly to systems for stabilizing the DC levels of the respective color signal drives for a color kinescope in receivers of the type incorporating apparatus for automatic control of color kinescope biasing. An illustrative arrangement for automatic control of color kinescope biasing in a color television receiver is that described in 4,263,622 HUS A Hinn. In the Hinn arrangement, a control period, occupying a period of several successive line intervals within each vertical blanking interval, is set aside for monitoring a black level current produced by an electron gun under reference signal conditions, for detection of departures from a desired current level, and for readjustment of gun bias to oppose the undesired departures. During a portion of the control period, the color kinescope grid receives a conduction enhancing pulse bias control is based upon information derived as indicative of the change in cathode current level introduced by the grid pulsing. An advantageous system for utilization of the above described Hinn approach in maintenance of an appropriate bias relationship among the color kinescope s gun trio in the face of aging and other parameter variations is described in US A 4,484,228 of R. P. Parker. For successful use of automatic kinescope bias AKB control in the manner exemplified by the structures of the aforementioned Hinn and Parker patents, it is recognized in cofiled European Patent Application EP A 0 146 343 RCA 76593 corresponding to US A 4 554 588 entitled Control System For Luminance Chrominance Signal Processing Circuits that the luminance chrominance signal processing circuits, which process signal information for delivery to the color kinescope during the time periods intervening the periodically recurring kinescope bias control intervals, require some suitable form of manipulation during the kinescope bias control intervals to avoid undesirable disturbance or contamination of the current monitoring and bias adjustment functions. The luminance chrominance signal processing circuits of a color television receiver conventionally serve to process the luminance and chrominance components of received composite color television signals so as to derive therefrom a set of three color signals for delivery to a color kinescope to achieve a color image reproduction. Stability of the DC levels of the delivered color signals is important to achievement of faithful color renditions in the reproduced image. It is the particular concern of the present invention to provide a system for such DC level stabilization that will also facilitate accurate operation of AKB control circuits incorporated in the receiver. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a color television receiver is advantageously provided with a DC stabilization system including a pair of control loops, both functioning to adjust the DC level of the luminance signal contribution to the formation of the set of color signals. One of the control loops includes a first keyed comparator, enabled only during gating intervals within horizontal blanking portions of line intervals which lie outside of the kinescope bias control intervals. The first keyed comparator serves to compare a reference voltage with the voltage attained by one of the color signals during said gating intervals. The first comparator output is applied to the receiver s luminance channel to oppose departures of said attained color signal voltage from substantial equality with the reference voltage. The other of the pair of control loops includes a second keyed comparator, enabled only during each of said kinescope bias control intervals, and serving to compare said reference voltage with the voltage attained by said one of the color signals during said kinescope bias control intervals. The second comparator output is applied to the receiver s luminance channel to oppose departures of said attained color signal voltage from substantial equality with the reference voltage. Illustratively, the output of the first keyed comparator is stored by a capacitor during the periods intervening successive gating intervals, with the capacitor value chosen to provide the first control loop with an effective time constant which is long relative to a line interval so as to substantially avoid horizontal, as well as vertical, shading effects. In contrast, the effective time constant of the second control loop is short relative to a line interval duration. As described in the aforementioned cofiled European Patent Application EP A 0 146 343 RCA 76593 corresponding to US A 4 554 588 it is desirable to set the luminance amplifier gain to a minimum value independent of the viewer s contrast or picture control adjustments during each kinescope bias control interval so as to protect AKB operations from disturbance by received signal components. However, full protection of the AKB operations may be compromised by signal leak through of VITS Vertical Interval Test Signal signal components, for example, occurring in the luminance amplifier under the minimum gain conditions. The fast acting second control loop, described above, provides a facility for lessening the adverse effects of any such signal leak through by introducing significant degeneration at the video signal frequencies. The above described two loop arrangement for adjustment of the DC level of the luminance signal contribution to the formation of the color signal outputs is desirably accompanied by additional control loops for adjustment of the DC levels of the color difference signal contributions to color signal formation. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, employed in a color television receiver wherein I and Q color difference signals are recovered by synchronous detection of received chrominance signals and matrixed to form a set of color difference signals of R Y, B Y and G Y form, the DC stabilization system includes a third control loop adjusting the DC level of the I signal input to the matrixing operation, and a fourth control loop adjusting the DC level of the Q signal input to the matrixing operation. The third and fourth control loops, with long effective time constants comparable to the first control loop s time constant, include respective third and fourth keyed comparators, enabled during gating intervals corresponding to those associated with the operation of the first keyed comparator. The third keyed comparator illustratively serves to compare the voltage attained by the red color signal during the gating intervals with the aforementioned reference voltage, while the fourth keyed comparator illustratively serves to compare the voltage attained by the green color signal during the gating intervals with the aforementioned reference voltage. Under these illustrative circumstances, the first and second keyed comparators are rendered responsive to the blue color signal. In the accompanying drawings, FIGURES 1 and 1a illustrate, partially schematically and partially by block representation, cooperating portions of a color television receiver incorporating a DC stabilization system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and FIGURE 2 illustrates graphically waveforms of aid in explaining the operation of the FIGURE 1 system. The color television receiver portion illustrated in FIGURE 1 includes a gain controlled luminance signal amplifier 40. The circuitry only partially illustrated of amplifier 40, which processes the luminance signal component of received composite color video signals, includes an output NPN transistor 4l, having a collector electrode connected to the positive terminal V The amplifier output terminal L is directly connected to the base electrode of an NPN transistor 43, disposed in an emitter follower configuration with its collector electrode directly connected to the V Level shifted luminance signals, appearing at the collector electrode of transistor 46, are coupled via the base emitter path of an NPN emitter follower transistor 45 to a luminance signal output terminal Y. The collector electrode of transistor 45 is directly connected to the V The luminance signals appearing at terminal Y are supplied to respective inputs of a trio of signal combiners 25, 27, 29. The signal combiners 25, 27, 29 function to combine the luminance signals with respective color difference signals derived from the chrominance component of the received composite color video signals, to form a set of green, blue and red color signals at respective combiner output terminals G, B and R. For signal recovery from the received chrominance component, the color television receiver s chrominance signal channel includes a pair of color demodulators 11, 13. The output of demodulator 11, which recovers a Q color difference signal by conventional synchronous detection techniques, is subject to appropriate filtering by a Q filter 15, and then supplied as a signal input to a differential amplifier 19. The output of demodulator 13, which recovers an I color difference signal by conventional synchronous detection techniques, is subject to appropriate filtering by an I filter 17, and then supplied as a signal input to a differential amplifier 21. Differential amplifiers 19 and 21 also receive control inputs from apparatus to be described subsequently. Push pull versions of the Q color difference signals, appearing at respective output terminals Q and Q, of differential amplifier 19, and push pull versions of the I color difference signals, appearing at respective output terminals, I and I, of differential amplifier 21, are supplied as inputs to matrix circuits 23. Matrix circuits 23, illustratively of the general form disclosed in HUS A 4,272,778 Harwood, et al., provide appropriate combinations of the input signals to develop a green color difference signal at an output terminal G Y. a blue color difference signal at an output terminal B Y, and a red color difference signal at an output terminal R Y. The signals at terminals R Y, B Y and G Y serve as the respective color difference signal inputs to the aforementioned signal combiners 25, 27 and 29. Before considering the DC stabilization system elements of the FIGURE 1 arrangement, it is appropriate to consider the FIGURE 1a showing of apparatus for utilizing the respective color signals at the combiner output terminals R, B and G. As shown in FIGURE 1a, a trio of kinescope drivers 93, 94, 95 are provided, responsive respectively to the red color signal appearing at terminal R, the blue color signal appearing at terminal B, and the green color signal appearing at terminal G. Display of color images in response to the trio of color signals is effected on the viewing screen of a color kinescope 97, incorporating an electron gun assembly comprising individually energized cathode electrodes 98R, 98B and 98G and a commonly energized control grid structure 99. The red content of the displayed color image is determined by control of the intensity of an electron beam emanating from cathode 98R, which is driven by the output of kinescope driver 93. The blue content of the displayed color image is determined by control of the intensity of an electron beam emanating from cathode 98B, which is driven by the output of kinescope driver 94. The green content of the displayed color image is determined by control of the intensity of an electron beam emanating from cathode 98G, which is driven by an output of kinescope driver 95. The FIGURE 1a apparatus also includes automatic kinescope bias control circuits 96, which desirably operate in the manner described in the aforementioned Parker patent application. Thus, the bias control circuits 96 include means for supplying a conduction enhancing pulse to the kinescope control grid 99 during a predetermined portion of the bias control interval which interval, illustratively, occupies a period of seven lines duration during a post sync portion of each vertical blanking interval of the received signal . The bias control circuits 96 are responsive to inputs derived from the respective drivers 93, 94, 95 for sensing beam current changes induced by the grid pulsing, and develop therefrom respective DC outputs for application to the respective drivers 93, 94, 95 to suitably control the biases of the respective kinescope cathodes 98R, 98B, 98G , to which the driver outputs are DC coupled. As explained in the previously mentioned cofiled European Patent Application EP A 0 146 343 RAC 76593 corresponding to Patent Application Serial No. 561,176 for protection of the integrity of the AKB operations effected by the control circuits 96, the luminance amplifier 40 FIGURE 1 is desirably keyed to a minimum gain condition throughout each kinescope bias control interval. The manner in which the DC levels of the respective color signal inputs to the drivers 93, 94, 95 are controlled will now be explained, with reference to a stabilization system illustrated in FIGURE 1 which includes a trio of keyed voltage comparators 31, 33 and 35. Each of the comparators 31, 33 and 35 is enabled only during keying periods established in response to a keying wave appearing at terminal K. As illustratively shown by waveform k of FIGURE 2, the keying wave at terminal K comprises a train of positive going pulses, recurring at a line rate and timed to coincide with a backporch portion of horizontal blanking intervals of the received signal, but subject to disappearance during the aforementioned kinescope bias control intervals. Comparator 31 accepts the green color signal from terminal G for comparison with a reference input derived from a reference voltage terminal RV, and develops its output across a storage capacitor 32. The red color signal at terminal R is subject to comparison with the same reference voltage from terminal RV in comparator 33, which develops its output across storage capacitor 34. The blue color signal at terminal B is also subject to comparison with the reference voltage appearing at terminal RV in comparator 35, which develops its output across storage capacitor 36. A DC potential is developed across capacitor 32 which is representative of the difference, if any, existing between the green signal and reference inputs to comparator 31 during the aforementioned backporch keying periods, and is held during the intervals between successive keying periods. This DC potential is supplied as an input to differential amplifier 19, to modify the DC level of the Q color difference signal input to matrix circuits 23 in a direction tending to reduce the difference between the inputs of comparator 31. Similarly, the DC potential stored across capacitor 34 representative of the difference, if any, existing between the red signal and reference inputs to comparator 33 during the backporch keying periods is supplied as an input to differential amplifier 21, to modify the DC level of the I color difference signal inputs to matrix circuits 23 in a direction tending to reduce the difference between the inputs of comparator 33. The DC potential stored across capacitor 36, which is representative of the difference, if any, existing between the blue signal and reference inputs to comparator 35 during the backporch keying periods, is utilized to modify the DC level of the luminance signal input to combiners 25, 27, 29 in a direction tending to reduce the difference between the inputs of comparator 35. For this purpose, the DC potential across capacitor 36 is applied to the base electrode of an NPN transistor 50, disposed as an emitter follower, with its collector electrode directly connected to the V In addition to the three keyed voltage comparators 31, 33, 35 discussed above, the system of FIGURE 1 includes a fourth keyed voltage comparator employing a differential amplifier 60. Differential amplifier 60 is formed by a pair of NPN transistors 61, 62 with emitter electrodes interconnected via the series combination of resistors 63 and 64. A current source for differential amplifier 60 is formed by an NPN transistor 65, disposed with its collector electrode connected to the junction of resistors 63 and 64, and with its emitter electrode grounded. The base emitter path of transistor 65 is shunted by a diode 66, with its anode connected to the base electrode of transistor 65 and with its cathode grounded. An NPN transistor 68 is disposed as an emitter follower for supplying a keying wave to the base electrode of the current source transistor 65. The emitter electrode of transistor 68 ia connected via a resistor 67 to the base electrode of current source transistor 65, while the collector electrode of transistor 68 is directly connected to the V The base electrode of the emitter follower transistor 68 is connected to terminal A, at which keying waves, of the illustrative form shown by waveform a of FIGURE 2, are developed. Keying wave a comprises a train of positive going pulses which recur at a field rate, and each of which is timed to coincide with one of the aforementioned kinescope bias control intervals. During the appearances of the pulse components of keying wave a , current source transistor 65 is rendered conducting to enable the differential amplifier 60, which is disabled during all other intervals. The differential amplifier 60 is provided with an active load circuit employing a trio of PNP transistors 70, 71, 74, with the collector electrode of amplifier transistor 62 directly connected to the collector electrode of load transistor 71, and with the collector electrode of amplifier transistor 61 linked to the collector electrode of load transistor 74 via a forward biased diode 76 disposed with its anode connected to the collector electrode of transistor 74, and with its cathode connected to the collector electrode of transistor 61 . The emitter electrodes of load transistors 71 and 74 are returned to the V The above described disposition of transistors 70, 71, and 74 forms a current mirror arrangement wherein the collector current of load transistor 74 mirrors the collector current of amplifier transistor 62. An output lead directly links the collector electrode of load transistor 74 with the previously mentioned terminal L at the base electrode of the luminance signal translating emitter follower transistor 43 . If the potentials at the base electrodes of amplifier transistors 61, 62 are balanced during a period of enablement of differential amplifier 60, the collector current demand or transistor 61 is matched in magnitude with the current supplied via the collector electrode of load transistor 74, and the differential amplifier output provides no disturbance of the potential at the base electrode of transistor 43. If, however, an imbalance exists such that the potential at the base electrode of transistor 62 is elevated relative to the potential at the base electrode of transistor 61 during an enablement period, the magnitude of the current supplied via the electrode of load transistor 74 exceeds the collector current demand of transistor 61, with the excess supplied via the output lead to result in elevation of the potential at terminal L. Conversely, if a base potential imbalance of the opposite sense exists during an enablement period, the collector current demand of transistor 61 exceeds the magnitude of current supplied via the collector electrode of load transistor 74, with the consequence that the deficit is supplied from the output lead, resulting in a depression of the potential at terminal L. A reference voltage is supplied to one input of the differential amplifier 60 via the direct connection of the base electrode of amplifier transistor 62 to the reference voltage supply terminal RV. A signal voltage is supplied to the other input of the differential amplifier 60 by means of the connection of the base electrode of transistor 61 via series resistor 81 to the blue color signal output terminal B. The series combination of a resistor 82 and a capacitor 83 is connected between the base electrode of transistor 61 and ground, and cooperates with series resistor 81 to form a low pass filter 80 for the blue color signal applied to the differential amplifier 60. The output of a differential amplifier 60 is thus sensitive to departures, if any, of the blue color signal from substantial equality with the reference voltage at terminal RV during each enablement period, and the sense of the control it exerts upon the signal delivered to terminal Y is such as to oppose such departures. In the stabilization system described above, it is desired to substantially avoid image shading effects that would accompany failure to hold the control voltages developed across capacitors 32, 34, 36 during the periods intervening successive enablement periods for comparators 31, 33, 35. Accordingly, relatively large capacitance values e.g., 10 microfarads are employed for capacitors 32, 34, 36, providing effective time constants for the three control loops utilizing comparators 31, 33, 35 which are long relative to the duration of a line interval. In contrast, the control loop utilizing differential amplifier 60 employs no output storage capacitor and is provided with an effective time constant which is quite short relative to the duration of a line interval. The limit on the speed of response of the latter control loop is imposed by the low pass filter 80, introduced as a loop filter to insure stability. With illustrative values for filter elements 81, 82, 83 of 36 kilohms, 4 kilohms, and 20 picofarads, respectively, significant loop response is obtained at frequencies encompassing an appreciable portion of the luminance signal band. In operation of the above described stabilization system, the levels of the three color signals delivered to the kinescope drivers are stabilized against the effects of DC drifts in the receiver s luminance or chrominance channels by a system of three long time constant control loops 33, 34, 21 31, 32, 19 35, 36, 46 effecting level corrections of the I, Q, and Y signal components from which the three color signals are derived. Level correction of the y signal component by one of the long time constant control loops 35, 36, 46 is augmented by the operation of an additional Y correcting control loop 80, 60, 43 active only during the periodic kinescope bias control intervals when the other three control loops are maintained in a hold state . By providing the additional control loop with a short time constant permitting fast response, disturbances of the color signal outputs during AKB operations by received signal components such as VIT vertical interval test signals which may leak through the gain controlled luminance amplifier 40, even though the latter is desirably keyed to a minimum gain condition during each kinescope bias control interval are substantially precluded. The additional control loop, moreover, protects the AKB operations from adverse effects of any luminance signal level shift that may undesirably accompany the aforementioned luminance amplifier keying to a minimum gain condition. It may be noted that in one desirable arrangement for utilizing the present invention, means are incorporated for preventing the keying of comparators 31, 33 and 35 during at least a portion of the received signal s vertical sync interval, for error reduction purposes as explained in cofiled European Patent Application EP A 0 145 490 RCA 79620 corresponding to US A 4 554 577 of R. Shanley et al., entitled Keyed DC Stabilization System With Protection From Error Introduction During Vertical Sync Interval. In use of such an arrangement, the keying wave k will be free of positive going keying pulse components during the selected vertical sync interval portion.
