# HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A hydraulic system consists of an electrohydraulic set, a control set and a set of driven elements. The electrohydraulic set comprises a fluid tank to which is adapted a pump connected to a direct current electric motor by means of an elastic coupling, said pump capable of delivering the aspi rated fluid from the tank toward different electrovalves which control the actuation of the driven elements, and to which the latter are connected preferably by means of flexible pipes. The control set is formed by a group of pulsators commutators, the actuation of which determines the opera tion of the electrovalve s corresponding to the element s which are to be driven, this group being fed through a main switch and the set of pulsators commutators provided on the control board of the vehicle in a place easily accessible to the user. The set of driven elements is formed a unit of cylinders, preferably of double effect, the rods of which can be provided with rolling end elements, said cylinders positioned in precise places of the vehicle as a function of the operation these are to perform, and at least part of these cylinders being intersynchronized for their even expansion and at the same speed.
