## Description
The present invention relates to a reactor of new conception, suitable to carry out polymerizations in systems with high concentration of polymer. More particularly, the present reaction relates to a reactor essentially constituted by a cylindrical body having vertical axis, with upper and lower heads in correspondence of a generatrix of the cylinder there is provided a vertical axis opening, which puts the interior of the cylinder in communication with the body of an extruder, it too with vertical axis, and solid with the reactor. It is known how much it is convenient to operate the polymerization reactors, in the case of polymerization processes during which the polymer is formed in solution or in suspension in organic media, at a polymer concentra tion as high as possible. Such a way of proceeding, particularly when the concentration of polymer at reactor outlet is increased, allows considerable savings in ener getic consumptions to be achieved. However, all the methods followed so far in order to increase the polymer concentration to values as high as possible, to the purpose of achieving the highest saving, have not led to meaningful commercial results, so the processes of the prior art in which the polymer is formed either in suspension or in solution is organic media are still now being operated within concentration ranges which do not exceed 30 by weight, whilst the theory teaches that the satisfactory condition to the purpose of achieving an optimum energetic saving, is bound to a polymer concentration of the order of 60 70 by weight. Thus, due to the fact that operating in systems at high concentration of polymer becomes economically unad visable, resorting to processes of polymerization on fluid bed, or to processes in emulsion or suspension in aqueous media is preferred. However, many cases occur in which operating either in aqueous media, for instance because of the type of catalysis used Ziegler Natta, anionic, cationic cataly sis , or on fluid bed, for instance due to the character istics of produced polymer, as it occurs for the common elastomers, due to their too high tackiness, is not possible. In these cases, the industrial full scale pro ductions are still presently accomplished by operating the polymerization in organic media, wherein the polymer remains dissolved or suspended while it is being formed, at the above seen low concentrations, with all the draw backs which too have been briefly mentioned. In the specific case of the conjugated diolefins, the polymerization is mostly carried out in hydrocarbon solution to the purpose of controlling the polymerization temperature and hence obtaining soluble linear polymers, gel free or essentially gel free and having controlled molecular weight. The bulk polymerization of conjugated diolefins on the contrary has not found a meaningful development in the industrial practice, notwithstanding the undoubted advantages which a process carried out in the absence, or in the substantial absence of solvents or diluents would show as compared to a traditional process in solution. The reasons for that can be found in the uncertain or missed identification of suitable catalytic systems and or in the difficulties posed by the engineering, reological and heat exchange problems involved by the handling of high viscosity polymeric masses. So, the reaction heat must be withdrawn as evaporation latent heat of the reaction medium, and the vapours evolving from the reacting system must leave it at moderate rates in order not to drag with them polymeric masses to such an extent as to obstruct the outlet nozzle of the reactor. Furthermore, an accurate control of the reaction conditions must be possible, in such a way as not to have anomalies in the polymer formation history. The Applicant has found that obtaining the foregoing is possible by carrying out the bulk polymerization of the conjugated diolefins in a reactor which furthermore shows other considerable advantages, such as the self cleaning and the steadfastness in the distribution of permanent times. In fact, the object of the present invention is a reactor which allows polymerization reactions to be carried out in systems with high concentration of polymer, in particular bulk polymerizations and copolymerizations of conjugated diolefins. The reactor is diagrammatically shown in the accompanying drawing wherein Said reactor being essentially constituted by a vertical axis cylindrical body 1 with upper and lower heads and in which, in correspondence of a generatrix of the cylinder, an opening 2 with vertical axis is provided, which puts the interior of the cylinder in communication with the body 3 of an extruder, which too has vertical axis and is solid with the reactor. Going ahead with our reference to the figures, the reactor is provided with a vertical axis stirrer, the shaft of which enters from the bottom or from the top of the reactor. To the shaft one or more arms 4 perpendi cular to it are affixed, each of which supports a certain number of vertical blades 5 . Such blades are tapered from up downwards, so as to exert a thrust directed towards the reactor bottom, de pending on the stirrer revolution direction. The reactor is furthermore provided with one or more set s of stationary blades 6 , in correspondence of the free spaces between the stirrer blades 5 . In corre spondence of the opening 2 , the relative position of the revolving blades 5 and of the stationary blades 6 is such that the revolving blades positioned near the reactor centre may reach the corresponding stationary blades before the peripheral blades. The result of such a positioning is that whenever the revolving blades reach, during their revolution, the stationary blades positioned in correspondence of the opening 2 , to the contents of the reactor a thrust directed towards the periphery, and hence towards the opening 2 is applied. In correspondence of the other zones of the reactor, the stationary blades can be reached by the revolving blades either simultaneously, or according the above modalities, on the basis of the overall conveyance rate towards the periphery. The stirrer shaft is provided with an outer jacket 11 constituted by a pipe solid with the bottom head of the reactor, to the purpose of avoiding the Weissenberg s effect, which would occur, should the shaft rotate under contact with the reaction medium. The reactor is provided with a nozzle 7 for feed ing the catalyst to be used in the polymerization reac tion, positioned in the nearby of the shaft jacket, and with a nozzle 8 for feeding the monomer or the monomer and the possible solvent . An outlet nozzle 8 for the vapourized reaction medium for withdrawing the reaction heat or for the vapours of the same monomer, in case of bulk polymeriza tion, always to the purpose of controlling the tempera ture and an outlet nozzle 10 for the polymer in the form of a concentrated solution in the monomer s , or in the possible mixture thereof with a solvent are further more provided. The extruder can be a single screw or a twin screw extruder the characteristics of such screws are such as to provide a conveyance zone in correspondence of the polymer inlet from the reactor, such a zone being hence at least equal in length to the opening 2 , and a com pression zone. Of course, the usual measuring instruments, such as, e.g., the equipment for the measurement of the tempera ture, for the measurement of the maximum level of react ing system, etc., are present. The above described reactor can be used to carry out any polymerizations in systems at high polymer concentra tion, up to 60 by weight, and higher. A particular case of use is that relating to the bulk polymerization of conjugated diolefins, according to which the catalyst is added to simple homogeneous system containing one or more monomer s . Such a polymerization is the object of the following operative Example, from which further details shall ap pear as regards the reactor the purpose of this Example is to evidence the situation occurring inside the reactor during the operation, thus peculiarly illustrating the invention, the scopes of which however must not absolutely be considered as limited to it or by it. Atest has been carried out according to a continuous procedure by using a reactor having an inner diameter of 250 mm, and blades of 300 mm in height, equipped with two sets of three revolving blades and with three sets of two stationary blades during this test butadiene has been polymerized in the absence of solvent, by using a catalyst on neodymium basis complying with the following definition In particular. it has been used the composition prepared as follows Into a vessel of 5 litres of capacity, equipped with stirrer and heat exchange system, under nitrogen atmosphere there are charged 220 g 0.62 mol of neodymium oxide Nd₂O₃ at 95 945 g 3.9 mol of naphthenic acid, with acidity number of 230 180 g 1.9 mol of tert.butyl chloride at 98 2.8 kg of vaseline oil 10 ml of aqueous solution of HCl at 37 by weight. The mixture is kept stirred inside the vessel under nitrogen atmosphere, at the temperature of 60 C, for 3 hours. At the end of this time period, a mixture having an oily appearance is obtained. The mixture so obtained is charged into a vessel of 120 litres of capacity, equipped with stirrer. Into the same vessel also 50 l is charged of a solution containing 0.8 mol l of aluminium diisobutylmonohydride in vaseline oil. The reaction mass is kept stirred under nitrogen at room temperature about 20 C , for 2 hours. At the end of this time period, a catalytic solution is obtained, which contains the following concentrations, referred to neodymium, aluminium and chlorine neodymium 0.023 gram atoms l aluminium 0.74 gram atoms l chlorine 0.034 gram atoms l which is used in polymerization. Different productive capacities have been tested within the range of from 4 kg h to 20 kg h of polymer, by varying the stirrer rate from 20 to 80 revolutions per minute, while the temperature 60 C and the speed of the discharging extruder 80 g min having been kept constant. A typical run corresponds to the following conditions Polybutadiene is insoluble in the monomer. Under steady state conditions, inside the reactor the following situation is established, starting from the bottom a layer of monomer swollen polymer under equilibrium conditions solid phase , maintained in the lowest portion of the reactor because the stirrer blades have, as it has been seen hereinabove, a thrust effect directed downwards a layer of monomer wherein a negligible amount of polymer is dissolved a gas top layer. The catalyst, fed in the nearby of the shaft jacket, results uniformly distributed inside the solid phase surrounding the same jacket, due to the action carried out by the revolving blade.
