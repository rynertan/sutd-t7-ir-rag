# Print hammer assembly for an impact printer.

## Abstract
A print hammer assembly for an impact printer includes a hammer 19 having a head portion 47 positioned at one end of a beam 39 which is mounted at a pivot 41 for movement of the hammer between a rest position and a print position. Operation of the hammer 19 is controlled by first and second windings 11, 13 wound around two cores 15, 17 respec tively positioned adjacent two flanges 43, 45 of magnetic material provided on the beam 39 on either side of the pivot 41 . A drive pulse applied to the first winding 11 pivots the hammer 19 to its print position and a restoring pulse applied to the second winding 13 restores the hammer to its rest posi tion, the restoring action being assisted by a spring 63 . In order to avoid interference between the magnetic fields pro duced by the two windings 11, 13 the two cores 15, 17 are spaced apart and the drive pulse is arranged to terminate before the commencement of the restoring pulse.
