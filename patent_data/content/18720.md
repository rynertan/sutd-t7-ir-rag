# Filtration of a coal liquid slurry using an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and an alcohol.

## Abstract
The rate of filtration of a coal liquid slurry is increased by adding an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and an alcohol containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms to the slurry prior to filtration or by adding the alcohol to the slurry and washing a precoat cake of filter aid with an oil solution of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer prior to filtration. Although the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and the alcohol each provides a filter rate improving effect when used alone, a synergistic improvement in filtration rate is achieved by their combined use.
