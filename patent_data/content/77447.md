# SECTIONAL X RAY TABLE HAVING DUAL SERVO DRIVES

## Abstract
An x ray table base, an intermediate support mounted on the base for moving bidirectionally, and a carriage with a patient cradle on it mounted for moving bidirectionally on the support. There are individual servomotors for driving the support and cradle, respectively. Each servomoter drives an analog tachometer. The tachometer signals are compared with ramp signals. When, for example the intermediate support nears the limit of its forward travel, its servo amplifier receives a decreasing ramp signal and the servo amplifier for the cradle motor receives a concurrent increas ing ramp signal such that the support decelerates to zero velocity at a predetermined rate and the cradle accelerates to the previous constant velocity of the support at a rate that results in the cradle moving at a constant rate relative to the base.
