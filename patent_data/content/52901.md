# Method of producing integrated optical waveguide circuits and circuits obtained by means of this method.

## Abstract
Optical waveguide circuits, such as signal splitters can be produced by etching grooves in a transparent substrate and by filling said grooves with glass having a higher refractive index than the material of the substrate. Two substrates can be placed on top of each other with the surfaces in which the filled grooves have been provided in mutual contact so as to form a laminated integrated optical waveguide circuit.
