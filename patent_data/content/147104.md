# ELECTRO OPTIC DISPLAY STYSTEM WITH IMPROVED VIEWING ANGLE

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus provide an optical switching system 10 which provides independent of viewing angle two system optical transmission states of substantially contaminant free light. The system includes first and second light gates 12 and 12 of which each has associated therewith contaminant light intensity patterns 48 and 66 with points of local maxima 54, 56, 58, 60, 68, and 70 and local minima 62 and 72 in two system optical transmission states. The contaminant light intensity patterns are oriented so that the points of local maxima and minima of the contaminant light intensity patterns of one of the light gates generally align with the respective points of local minima and maxima of the contaminant light intensity patterns of the other light gate. The alignment of contaminant light intensity patterns blocks the transmission of contaminant light in two system optical transmission states, and thereby provides improved viewing angle performance.
