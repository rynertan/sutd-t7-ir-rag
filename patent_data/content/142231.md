# Process for producing sequential polyamino acid resin.

## Abstract
A sequential polyamino acid resin having a remarkably high molecular weight and special amino acid sequence as repeating unit in the resin can be produced by conducting polycondensation of a peptide active ester acid salt in an aprotic polar solvent in the presence of a tertiary amine and phosphorus pentoxide.
