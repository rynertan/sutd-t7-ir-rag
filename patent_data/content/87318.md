# Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
In an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus using an array type transducer probe 21 , an improvement can be made in a tomographic image resolution by electronically focusing ultrasonic wave toward an object to be examined in both directions, i.e., the array direction Y and the lens direction X . During first scanning of the ultrasonic transducer array in the array direction Y , the signals received from the probe 21 are synthesized each other via delay lines 241 to 245 having predetermined delay times to obtain first scanned signals in real time, so that focusing the reflected ultrasonic wave can be electronically accomplished in the array direc tion. After accomplishing this first scanning, the probe 21 is mechanically moved to a given position in the lens direction X normal to the array direction Y . Then second scanning operation is accomplished at the above position in the array direction Y , obtaining similarly first scanned signals. All of the first scanned signals are processed by a delay time control circuit 33 and then stored in the corresponding RAM s 31I to 31N respectively, after being converted into the digital signals. Finally, all of the stored first scanned signals are read out and synthesized each other by an adder circuit 34 to obtain second scanned signals, so that focusing the reflected ultrasonic wave can be accomplished in the lens direction X . The resultant second scanned signals are converted into analogue signals to be displayed as a tomographic image of the desired diagnostic part in the object.
