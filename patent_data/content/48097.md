## Description
REFINERY FUEL GAS SYSTEM This invention relates to a method and apparatus for feeding petroleum refinery gases into the fuel gas system of the refinery. The light hydrocarbon gases overheads obtained from the atmospheric distillation of crude oil in petroleum refineries may be fed into the fuel gas system of the refinery, using rotary or reciprocating compressors to bring the gases up to the pressure of the fuel gas system. Alternatively, if these gases are not fed into the fuel gas system they have to be flared and this represents a loss of useful energy. other gases which may also be fed into the fuel gas system include the process gases which are produced in the reformer, desulfurizing, cracking and liauid gas plants. Because these process gas streams are obtained at relatively high pressure with a relatively high energy content they may be fed directly into the fuel gas system although in most cases it is necessary to pass these gases through a throttle to bring their pressure down to that of the fuel gas system. We have now devised a method and an apparatus for utilizing the low pressure, light hydrocarbon refinery gases in the fuel gas system which avoids the necessity of using additional sources of energy to bring these gases to the higher pressures of the fuel gas system. According to the present invention, the energy which is necessary for compressing the low pressure refinery gases is derived from the process gases which are usually available at relatively high pressures and, in that condition, are capable of performing useful work. A gas jet compressor gas ejector is preferably used for this purpose. When the high pressure process gases are expanded through a throttle to reduce them to the lower pressure of the fuel gas system, the specific work that could be theoretically performed by the process gases during the expansion namely, the integral of the change in volume summed over the pressure differential, is not usefully employed. This, in turn, means that energy is lost during the expansion by heat dissipation. According to the present invention the potential energy of the high pressure gases is not dissipated during the expansion but rather, is used to act as the propellant gas for the gas jet compressor. There is then a transfer of energy to the fuel gas system.Use of the potential mechanical energy of the process gases in this way enables the low pressure refinery gases to be drawn into the suction side of the gas jet compressor and, from there, to be fed into the fuel gas system together with the propellant gas. The gas streams may reouire to be freed from sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide by scrubbing in an absorber, depending upon their degree of purity. This may be done byconoucting the output from the gas compressor either into the sour gas system before scrubbing and into the sweet gas system after scrubbing.Alternatively, if the gases are sufficiently free of sulfurcontaining impurities, they may be fed directly into the sweet gas system. It is also possible to conduct one part of the gas into the sour gas system and the other part into the sweet gas system.The selection among these possibilities is governed, amongst other factors, by the ratio of the amount of propellant gas to the amount of sour gas. Under otherwise similar conditions on the propellant side and suction side of the compressor, the amount of low pressure gas which can be drawn in will be greater at lower pressures on the fuel gas exhaust side. After scrubbing, the pressure will be lower than before scrubbing i.e. the pressure will be lower in the sweet gas system than in the sour gas system. The use of the gas jet compressor is highly advantageous compared to that of rotary and piston type compressors. The operating costs of rotary and reciprocating compressors are relatively high and, in addition, their mechanical parts are subject to failure, particularly when the gas volumes change, liquid impacts occur or the gases contain suspended liauid droplets. The operating and maintenance costs for a gas jet compressor, on the other hand, are negligible as the device does not have any mechanical parts which are subject to wear. The single figure of the accompanying drawings shows a schematic representation of a refinery gas system in which the low pressure gases are fed into the fuel gas system by means of a gas jet compressor. In the souse boxes of the Figure the respective pressures are indicated in bars and in the hexagonal boxes the respective temperatures are indicated in degrees Celsius. In the Figure, three gas jet compressors 101, 102, 103 are shown, each compressor having a suction side S and a propellant gas side T. The refinery gas is conducted through a line 110 to the suction sides of the gas jet compressors 101, 102, and 103. The refinery gas is, for example, the low pressure gas coming from an atmospheric distillation column. The pressure at the suction side is indicated as 1.5 bar. The first gas jet compressor 101 is connected on its propellant gas side to a line 111 supplying process gas from a reformer. Correspondingly, process gas is conducted in line 112 from the liquid gas plant to the gas jet compressor 102 and gas from the cracker liquid gas plant is conducted in line 113 to the gas jet compressor 103. The indicated pressures on the propellant gas sides are in the range between 18.and 28 bars. Gas jet compressor 101 is directly connected through valveCSO to a line 104 of the fuel gas system for sweet fuel gas because, according to experience, sweet gas can be supplied from the reformer. Correspondingly, a connection is provided from the gas jet compressors 102 and 103 through valves CSO to a line 105, the latter being a line of the fuel gas system for sour fuel gas.Accordingly, it is indicated by an arrow that this fuel gas is passed on to H2S scrubbing and is intended for consumption only after scrubbing. A feedback line runs from gas jet compressors 102 and 103 to the suction side, and this can be actuated through a suitable pressure controller PC1.
