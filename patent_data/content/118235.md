# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube 1 having a body 3 of glass material and a faceplate 5 of solid phosphor material. The body 3 and faceplate 5 are sealed together by a sealant 15 of malleable halide material for example silver chloride, or lead silver chloride eutectic. Sealing is effected by inserting a ring 15 of sealant material between abutting surfaces of the body 3 and the faceplate 5 , heating in vacuum to above the melting point of the sealant, and cooling to allow the sealant to solidify. The faceplate 5 may be of single crystal material eg zing tungstate or calcium borate, or may be of hot pressed solid material eg zinc yttrium silicate.
