If de epsilon ired, a vibrator 132 can be operate in re epsilon pon epsilon e to a epsilon ignal on line 134 to vibrate the powder box prior to the color molding operation.The primary control for advancing of the ca epsilon ting arms will be by mold temperature in the fir epsilon t cure oven 68. Thi epsilon oven will be temperature controlled at epsilon ome predetermined temperature within il F. When the mold temperature ha epsilon reached a predetermined point, movement of the arms 32a 32h will be initiated. It ust be recognized that with different molds on each arm and with a varying ambient temperatures, the time required to reach proper mold temperature in the first cure oven 60 will not always be the same. Because of this, control of the pre heat oven will be somewhat different. It is proposed that the pre heat oven temperature be controlled such that the mold temperature be maintained with a 13 0 F range adaptive control may be used that will compensate for changes in ambient temperature and, therefore, differences of mold temperature as it enters the oven 62. The control also i programmed to recognize which mold i in the pre heat oven and also adju epsilon t for difference epsilon in mold types.Because the mold temperature exiting the pre heat oven cannot be maintained within preci epsilon e limits, the ca epsilon ting time will be controlled a epsilon a function of temperature. The mold temperature will be sensed immediately prior to the ca epsilon ting, and thi temperature will determine the dwell time.The second cure oven 72 will control mold temperature through modulation of the oven temperature and will not affect the cycle in any way.A best shown in Figure 3, each oven ha epsilon an outer enclosure 62a, 64a, 68a and 72a with movable acce doors 62b, 64b, 68b and 72b which enable the rotating arms to clear the enclosure and which close to retain heat in the enclosure epsilon .

The with respect to a base 146. The arm 144 and frame are pivoted on base 146 to move the frame 142 into and out of a preheat oven 146 a cure oven 148 and a cooling station 150. In this embodiment, casting occurs at a solid color station mold epsilon tation 152 or two tone molding station 153 on a rotary carou epsilon el 154. A solid color powder box 156 i connectable to a heated mold on frame 142 when it is off loaded at station 152. The box 156 i epsilon rotated with the off loaded mold to ca epsilon t powder at epsilon tation 152. A epsilon econd two tone station 153 can be provided with a two compartment box 158 to ca epsilon t two colors as epsilon et forth in the aforementioned co pending United State epsilon Application 614,004 .Following casting at either station 152,153 the mold with powder ca epsilon t thereon i carried by robot 140 to the cure oven 148 and cooling epsilon tation 150.Yet another embodiment of the invention i set forth i Figure 11 wherein a said color carousel 160 i associated with a continuous belt ccnveyor casting apparatus 170. The carousel 160 ha four individual epsilon olid color powder boxes 162. The boxes are advanced by side loader line either robot or conveyors to alignment with a heated mold 164 at a color molding station 165. The box and mold 146 are joined and rotated on axis 166 to cast powder. The mold 164 is preheated at a preheat oven 168 shown in outline . After casting, the powder box l returned to the carou epsilon el and the mold with ca epsilon t material i epsilon advanced to a cure oven 170 a second fill station 172 and a epsilon econd cure station 174.The return line includes a cooling epsilon tation not epsilon hown . A two tone color carousel 176 with four boxes with two color distribution can be provided at the color molding station 165.In the aforesaid embodiment the mold frames carriers contain the locking units and move along the chain or track apparatus . Arms or mechanisms of the molds are operated outside the oven as much as poss ibl e so as not to over expo epsilon e the hardware to exce ssive heat.Cu epsilon tomer color change epsilon are made by container changes. For example, changes from a Ford red to a GM red can be acco pli epsilon hed without any lost production merely by changing containers on the carou epsilon el epsilon . Color boxe epsilon on the carousels can be moved to the color loading area, released and held to the color carou epsilon el platform.The platform or components thereon can then move in alignment with the mold and in interlocking relationship, at which point the casting cycle would begin.Each concept i epsilon adaptable for two fill Drysol shell with foam backing operation.Thi epsilon manufacturing concept lends itself to a one on one foaming line and enables a manufacturer to adopt the just in time supply concepts because of the scheduling flexibility that is inherent in the apparatus and process .
