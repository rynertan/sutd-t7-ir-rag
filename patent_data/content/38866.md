# COMPACT LOW SURFACE AREA DIALYZER METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A compact blood dialyzer is described having a low sur face area of semi permeable membrane as compared with the dialyzer systems in use today. The dialyzer can be manufac tured at relatively low cost to be provided as a pre sterilized unit feasible for use in dialysis at home. Arterial pressure can pump the blood through the compact dialyzer unit. The blood and dialysate flow in multiple parallel channels on opposite sides of the semi permeable membranes, with the blood being directed as wide thin films travelling against the surface of the membrane, thereby providing an efficient exposure of the flowing blood to the surface of the membrane. Advan tageously, the blood flows upwardly in its channels against gravity for assuring complete filling of each and every channel with the blood being effectively pushed against the surface of the membrane for enhancing the osmotic action. The dialyzer unit is shown flexed into an arc during usage for clamping the plates firmly against the membrane sandwiched between them.
