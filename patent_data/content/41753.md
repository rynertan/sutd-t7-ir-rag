# Deflection system for charged particle beam.

## Abstract
A system for achromatcally deflecting a beam of charged particles without producing net divergence of the beam com prises three successive magnetic deflection means A, B, C which deflect the beam alternately in opposite directions, first A and second B by angles of less than 50 and the third C by an angle of at least 90 particles with different respec tive energies are transversely spaced as they enter the third deflection means C , but emerge completely superimposed in both positions and direction, and maybe brought to a focus F in each of two mutually perpendicular planes a short dis tance thereafter. Such a system may be particularly compact, especially in the direction in which the beam leaves the sys tem, and is suitable for deflecting a beam of electrons from a linear accelerator 5,6,7 so as to produce a vertical beam of electrons or with an X ray target, of X rays which can be rotated about a horizontal patient for radiation therapy.
