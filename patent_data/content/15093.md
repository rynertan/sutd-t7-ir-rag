# Process and device for coating solid particles.

## Abstract
Solid particles are coated with either liquids or solids whilst the particles are moving as a uniform layer over the surface of a rotating body 2 and subsequently discharged from the surface by centrifugal force. Two forms of coating apparatus designed to coat prills are shown, the preferred apparatus having a flexible conical disc 10 carrying a layer of existing material which touches the rim of the rotating body from which the solid is discharged.
