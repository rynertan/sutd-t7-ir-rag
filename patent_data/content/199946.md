# INSTRUCTION PREFETCH BUFFER CONTROL

## Abstract
An instruction prefetch buffer control 20 is provided for an instruction prefetch buffer array 10 which stores the code for a number of instructions that have already been executed as well as the code for a number of instructions yet to be executed. The instruction prefetch buffer control includes a register 201 for storing an instruction fetch pointer, this pointer being supplied to the buffer array, 10 as a write pointer which points to the location in the array where a new word is to be written from main memory. A second register 205 stores an instruction execution pointer which is supplied to the buffer array 10 as a read pointer. A first adder 203 increments the first register to increment the instruction fetch pointer for sequential instructions and calculates a new instruction fetch pointer for branch instruc tions. A second adder 215 increments the second register to increment the instruction execution pointer for sequential instructions and calculates a new instruction execution pointer for branch instructions. Incrementing of the second register is variable depending on the length of the instruc tion. A third adder 221 is responsive to the output of the first adder and a branch target address to calculate whether the target instruction is contained in the array 10 and, if it is, causes the new instruction execution pointer calculated by the second adder 215 to be loaded into the second register 205 .
