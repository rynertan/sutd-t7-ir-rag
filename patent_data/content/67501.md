# Alloy suitable for use in a radioactive radiation environment and a reactor core component formed therefrom.

## Abstract
An alloy suitable for use in an environment exposed to neutron radiation consists principally of Cr Ni austenite stainless steel. To increase its resistance to radiation, the steel contains nitrogen in an amount exceeding the impurity level and has principally an austenite structure. The alloy is useful for reactor core components such as a core shroud, core supporters, control rod etc., which are exposed to the neutron radiation. The high N content prevents embrittle ment by the radiation.
