## Description
Improved Shirred Stick of Tubular Casing Material This invention relates to a shirred stick of tubular film casing material of the type used to encase foodstuffs and other flowable or compressible material. In particular, the invention relates to an improved shirred stick of tubular film casing which may be more conveniently and more cleanly filled by means of an extrusion packing machine than has been possible heretofore. The invention also includes a method of shirring tubular film to form the said shirred stick and a method of packaging flowable material using the said shirred stick. In the packaging of food products, such as varieties of sausage meat or processed cheese or nonfood products such as explosives and caulking compounds and the like in thin walled synthetic or natural tubular casings, great care is required to reduce or prevent the backflow of the product towards the stored shirred casing and to prevent leakage of the product to the outside. Additional care is also required to limit the entry of air into the casing along with the product being encased since in many instances the presence of air may be detrimental especially in food packaging.Preventive measures designed to guard against product leakage and air ingress include, for example, the use of tight fitting spring loaded donut seals through which the tubular casing drawn from the st is readed ne r the i of filling.These seals, he ,vever, require constant attention to maintain operability and, as well, tend to exert excessive friction and drag on the film as it is drawn therethrough. This drag limits the ability of a packing machine operator to produce a soft packed or slack packed product, which type of package is often required for meat products which may subsequently swell upon cooking. Another commonly used antileakage and air proofing technique emplcys a flexible cup seal which contacts and wipes the inner casing wall as the casing is advanced during filling. Such a cup seal, which is pressed against the casing wall by the pressure of the contacting extruded filling product, interferes with packing control due to the variability of the pressures and the braking action exerted by the seal upon the casing. The improved shirred stick of the present invention eliminates the need for any spring activated or pressure seals or other similar devices to prevent product leakage or air ingress. The improved shirred stick of tubular film casing material of the present invention comprises a shirred casing having a tubular bore therethrough, said bore being lined with an integral unshirred extended end length portion of the said tubular casing, the leading end of said bore lining unshirred casing portion being adapted for leakproof connection in contact with and surrounding the filling means of a filling apparatus, and the said shirred casing being adapted to be drawn from said stick over the point of leakproof connection of said bore lining material with said filling means. The invention also includes the method of packaging extrudable material into casing material provided as the shirred sticks of the invention. The invention may be more clearly ur erstood by referring to the accompanying arawings nerein , Fig. 1 is a side section view of a conventional prior art shirred stick mounted on a packing machine filling horn during packaging operations Fig. 2 is a side section view of a shirred stick according to the present invention mounted on a filling horn during packaging operations Fig. 3 is a side section view of a shirred stick according to the present invention supported on an internal hollow bobbin, and Figs. 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d show in diagrammatic form a sequence of steps which may be employed in the preparation of a shirred stick according to the present invention. Referring to Fig. 1 there is shown a filling horn 1 of an extrusion packaging machine not shown . Mounted near the open end of horn 1 is a seal holder 2 having attached thereto a circular, flexible seal ring 3.Shirred tubular casing material 4 is shown mounted on horn 1. The forward end 5 of casing 4 is shown gathered and sealed by, for example, a metal clip 6. Casing filling product, for example, sausage meat 7, is shown being extruded under pressure from horn 1 into the closed forward end of casing 4. As extrusion of product 7 continues, succeeding sections of casing 4 are deshirred and are drawn in the direction shown by the arrow 8 to form a long continuous sausage. The sausage is gathered and clipped at appropriate intervals not shown to provide separate sausage links. During the filling operation, the tendency of filling material 7 to flow backwards into the shirred portion of casing 4, and thence to the outside as indicated by arrows 9, is reduced by the sealing action of seal ring 3 against the inner wall of casing 4.For effective sealing against loss of product, very tight contact is required between ring 3 and casing 4 which tight contact tends to produce a high level of drag acting against the advance of casing 4. This, in turn, requires the employment odct extrin rressures which tends to develop an unduly hard packed and overfilled package. Referring to Fig. 2, where like numerals are used, there is shown a filling horn 1 of an extrusion packaging machine not shown . Close to and cut into the forward open end of horn 1 is a circumferential depression or groove 10 having in tight fitting contact therewith a resilient 0 shaped retaining ring 11. Shirred tubular casing material 4 is shown mounted on horn 1. An unshirred end portion 4a of casing 4 is passed through the bore of casing 4 and tightly secured between groove 10 and retaining ring 11. The forward end 5 of casing 4 is shown gathered and sealed by a metal clip 6. Casing filling product such as sausage meat 7, is shown being extruded from horn 1 into the closed forward end of casing 4.As product extrusion proceeds, succeeding lengths of casing 4 are deshirred and advance in the direction shown by arrow 8. The thus formed sausage may be gathered, clipped and cut at appropriate intervals to provide separate sausage or package portions. An external adjustable friction drag component 12 is shown in contact with the outer surface of the filled section of casing 4. During the operation of filling casing 4 as depicted in Fig. 2, the back flow of product into the shirred portion of the casing is prevented from reaching the outside by virtue of the tight seal provided by the bore lining length 4a of casing 4 at ring 11 and groove 10. Similarly, ingress of air into the product is prevented by the same sealing arrangement. Adjustment of the density or firmness of the filled casing can be made by drag component 12 and is thus independent of the filling pressure through horn 1. Referring to Fig. 3 there is shown shirred casing 4 similar to that of Fig. 2 except that the casing is supported on a hollow bobbin i, rathe than e g horn of an extrusion packing machine. Wnshlrred end length 4a of casing 4 is shown passed between bobbin 13 and shirred casing 4 and is secured by a wire or clip 11 against deshirring during transportation and handling. Bobbin 13, which may be of plastic, metal or stiffened cardboard, is adapted to fit over the filling horn of a packaging machine where the end 14 of unshirred length 4a can be secured to the filling horn as shown in Fig. 2. Referring to Figs. 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d there is shown a roll of lay flat tubing 20 of natural or synthetic film. The open end 21 of tubing 20 is secured in the end of a pipe 22 by means of a perforated plug 23 as shown in Fig. 4a. To aid in the back folding and shirring operation, low pressure air is injected in the direction of the arrow through pipe 22 and the perforation in plug 23 to inflate the layflat tubing 20.Fig. 4b shows film section 24 of film 20 folded over pipe 22 and then back folded as section 25. Fig. 4c shows film section 25 shirred over film section 24.Fig. 4d shows the completed shirred stick withdrawn from pipe 22 and with plug 23 removed. Deshirring is prevented by a wire tie or clip 11. If desired, the shirred stick may be further protected against deshirring or contamination by means of a sheathing material as disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,033,382. Typical of the film material which may be used in the improved shirred stick of the invention include, for example, synthetic film forming material such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, acrylic or vinyl chloride polymers and natural proteinaceous film such as edible collagen. As can be seen the improved shirred stick of the present invention provides protection against loss of fillet j ,zoduct and ingress of air during packaging and eliminates the need for any dynamic seals or other arrangements rev e cape to the outside.
