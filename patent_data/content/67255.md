The cooler comprises a first section or body 11 in which a plurality of cylindrical compartments 12 are formed. A second section or cover 13 is securable over the open end of the body 11 whereby the cylindrical compartments 12 are enclosed within the body 11. A plurality of these cylindrical compartments are arranged about a central chamber 14 which is formed within the body 11, and which is delineated about a pillar 15 formed integral with the body 11 and extending concentric with the axis of the central chamber 14. In the present embodiment of the cooler, the cylindrical compartments are equidistan,tly spaced and arranged in a circle in the first section and the pillar extends at the center of thts circle in the central chamber 14. The cover 13 is rNelPforçed by an enlarged circular. projection 16 which is guided within the top open area of the central chamber 14. A bore 17 extends through the enter of the cover within a circular bushing reé4vtpg cavity 17 to receive a securement screw fastener 18 therein.A bushing like wing nut 47 is thre.,add on the free end 18 of the fastener 18 whereby the cover can be engaged over the top wall 19 of the body 11 with the pressure of the fastener distributed over the reinforced projection 16 not to damage or weaken the cover and to prevent leakage of cold air.Thus, the cylindrical compartments 12 are concealed within the cooler body and these are in communication with air refrigerated by a cold pack 20 which is located about the pillar 15. In order to have access to the compartments 12, a recess 58 is provided in a peripheral area of the cover 13 whereby rotation of the cover about the screw fastener 18 will give access to the individual compartments 12 through the recess 58. Referring again to Figures 1 to 3, a central cavity 21 is formed in the bottom wall 22 of the body 11 to define an opening in the outer bottom surface 23 of the cooler body. The pillar 15 is provided with a bore 24 which extends substantially at the center of the cavity 21 and which is adapted to receive the securement screw 18, previously mentioned. As hereinshown, the bottom wall 25 of the cavity 21 has a bushing receiving recess 26 concentrically positioned with respect to the bore 24.This recess is to receive a bushing 27 in close fit therein whereby to add rigidity to the pillar 15 in the area where the securement screw 18 is received.As shown, in Figure 3, the flat shoulder under the head 28 of the screw 18 abuts the end wall 29 of the bushing 27 and thus distributes the tension in the screw 18 in the bushing 27 when the cover is placed on the body 11 and the wing nut 47 is tightened. Referring now more specifically to Figures 4 to 6, there is shown a food receptacle 40 which is adapted to be retained in the central cavity 21.The food receptacle 40 comprises a receptacle part 41 having a bottom wall 42, a side wall 43, and an open top end 44. A lid or cover 55 is removably securable about the open end 44 and frictionally held thereabout. Retention means, herein provided in the form of retention ribs 45, are formed integral with the side walls 43 of the receptacle part 41. These ribs are utilized to frictionally retain the receptacle part in the central cavity. The securement is effected by dimensioning the cavity 21 to receive the ribs of the receptacle part in frictional engagement with recessed portions 46 the side wall 30 of the cavity 21. As shown in Figure 5, there are four such retention ribs 45 located in the corners of the receptacle part 41 and extending transverse to the horizontal plane of the receptacle. These ribs also space the side wall 43 of the receptacle from the side wall 30 of the cavity whereby to permit finger engagement of the lid 55 to attach or detach the lid from the open end 44 of the container.Thus, it is not necessary to remove the container from the cavity each time the lid is to be removed for access to the foodstuff therein or to place the lid back on the receptacle. As shown in Figure 2, the recessed portions 46 in the cavity side wall 30 are delineated by arcuate side wall portions resulting in the formation of the cylindrical compartments 12. These recessed portions 46 orient the receptacle 40 to a desired position within the central cavity 21. The ribs and the recessed portions also prevent the receptacle from being displaced or rotated in its planar axis. When the lid 55 is attached to the open end 44 of the receptacle, and the receptacle is secured in the cavity 21, the lid outer face 56 is flush with the bottom surface 23 of the cooler body 11 thus not providing obstruction for accidental detachment. The receptacle 40 and the cavity 21 are dimensioned whereby the receptacle 40 may carry two sandwiches 48, each not more than 1 1 4t thick. The lid 55 is molded from polyethylene material and the body part 41 is also molded from polyethylene material for good adherence between the lid and body to obtain a moisture proof seal. Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown a modification of the bottom wall 42 of the receptacle part 41. As herein shown, the retention means is constituted by themeans for mounting the cover 13 on the body 11 and, namely, by the securement screw 18. The bottom wall 42 may be molded with a central bushing like depression 53 having a hole 52 therein. The depression 53 has a flat bottom wall 51 into which the hole 52 is centrally located. The flat bottom wall 51 constitutes a shoulder portion about the hole whereby the head 28 of the fastener 18 will rest and provide retention of the receptacle within the cavity. A washer not shown may also be located over the flat bottom wall 51 under the head 28 to minimize wear of the material in this region. Alternatively, the depression 53 may be molded for close fit within the recess 26 of Figure 3 and the bushing 27 could be eliminated or received in the depression 53, This type of retention means provides a more positive retention of the receptacle and also makes the receptacle removably securable in the cavity 21. With such an arrangement, instead of guide ribs, the side wall 43 of the container may have a shape to localize itself within the cavity 21 in close contact with the side wall 30 of the cavity to prevent displacement of the receptacle within the cavity.Furthermore, the orientation of the receptacle could be achieved by giving the bushing like depression 53 a predetermined shape and modifying the recess 26 in the bottom wall 25 of the cavity 21 t9 be of identical shape.Thus, the receptacle would only fit in one oriented direction within the cavity 21. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, it can be seen that the bottom surface 23 of the cooler body 11 is provided with circular indentation 35 concentric and adjacent each cylindrical compartment 12. These indentations serve as shallow receptacles to guide the bottom end of cylindrical beverage containers 36 when the cooler is placed upside down with the bottom surface 23 providing a tabletop like support surface. With the lid 55 removed from the receptacle part 41 of the receptacle 40, the central portion of the support surface exposes the food peanuts, sandwiches, etc. whilst several beverage containers are securely supported on the surface 23. This is particularly advantageous when the cooler is used, for example, while on a picnic or at the beach and serves as a table.For example, when on a sandy surface, at a beach, where the surface is irregular and sand or other debris can easily get into the food, the elevated surface 23 protects the food from such substances.The cooler herein serves as a more sanitary type device for supporting food and beverages when eating outdoors. Referring again to Figure 3, there is shown the dimension of the cavity 21 with respect to the body portion of the cooler. As herein shown, the central chamber 14 which receives the cold pack 20 has a support surface 37 which extends substantially mid way of the depth of the cylindrical compartments. The bottom wall 25 of the central cavity 21 is spaced a distance from the surface 37 defined by the thickness of the bottom wall 22. The cold pack 20 is in communication with the cylindrical compartments 12 through the openings or channels 38 defined by the space above the support wall 37 and between the channel side walls 39 delineated by the protrusion portions 50 of the side wall extending between the cylindrical compartments 12. As also shown in Figure 1, a carrying handle 57 is molded integrally with the body 11 and positioned at right angles to the central longitudinal axis of the cylindrical compartments 12. The handle is molded within the circumference of the cooler thereby eliminating any protrusions and reducing the size of the cooler. Thus, there is provided a cooler which is compact, easily transportable1 low cost and which provides for the storage of cylindrical type beverage containers as well as provides an air tight moisture proof container to carry foodstuff and which may be alternatively used as a sanitary table like support surface. It is within the ambit of the present invention to cover any obvious modifications of the preferred embodiment described herein provided such modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims.
