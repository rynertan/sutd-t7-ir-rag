# Apparatus for injecting disinfectant and or protective liquids into structures of wood and other materials.

## Abstract
Apparatus for injecting disinfectant and or protective liquids into structures of wood or stone. The apparatus comprises a portable drill 1 having a chuck 8 with an axial hole 11 , and carrying a twist bit 13 with an inlet duct 12 which is aligned with the axial hole 11 of the chuck 8 and communicates with ducts 13 opening at the tip of the bit. Means 4, 3, 3a, 5 are provided for supplying the disinfectant and or protective liquid under pressure to the axial hole 11 of the chuck 8 at a regulable flow rate, so as to injuect the liquid into the structure through the bit 13 used for drilling.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Apparatus for injecting disinfectant and or protective liquids into structures of wood and other materials, characterised in that it comprises, in combination, a portable drill 1 having a chuck 8 with an axial hole 11 , a twist bit 13 carried by the chuck 8 and having an inlet duct 12 which is aligned with the axial hole 11 of the chuck 8 and communicates with ducts 14 formed in the helical part of the bit 13 and opening at its tip, means 4, 3, 5 for supplying a disinfectant and or protective liad under pressure to the axial hole 11 of the chuck 8 , and means 3a associated with the handle of the portable drill I for controlling the flow of the pressurised liquid. 2 Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the axial hole 11 of the chuck 8 communicates through radial holes 10 with an annular chamber 6 formed in a feed ring 7 sealingly surrounding the chuck, the annular chamber 6 communicating through a connector with a supply tube 4,5 for the pressurised liquid 3. Apparatus according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that a valve 3 is connected in the supply tube 4, 5 and is supported by the structure of the drill 1 and provided with a trigger control 3a .

## Description
Apparatus for injecting disinfectant and or protective liquids into structures of wood and other materialsThe present invention relates to apparatus for injecting disinfectant and or protective liquids into structures of wood and other materials, for example stone.According to the prior art, it is necessary to carry out two separate operations in order to inject liquids into such materials, more precisely a drilling operation and a subsequent step of injecting the liquid into the hole previously made.The apparatus which constitutes the subject of the present invention has the object of simplifying these operations and of reducing the time and hence the relative costs.In order to achieve this object, the apparatus of the present invention is characterised mainly in that it comprises, in combination a portable drill having a chuck with an axial hole, a twist bit carried by the chuck and having an inlet duct which is aligned with the axial hole of the chuck and communicates with ducts formed in the helical part of the bit and opening at its tip, means for supplying a disinfectant and or protective liquid under pressure to the axial hole of the chuck, and means associated with the handle of the portable drill for controlling the flow of the pressurised liquid. By virtue of this characteristic, the apparatus according to the present invention allows the injection to be carried out simultaneously with the drilling step, thus achieving a substantial saving in time and costs.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the description which follows with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is an elevational view of apparatus according to the present invention,Figure 2 is a detail of the bit on an enlarged scale,Figure 3 is an end view of the bit illustrated inFigure 2, on an enlarged scale, andFigure 4 is a sectional view of a detail of Figure 1 on an enlarged scale.In the drawings, a portable drill is generally indicated 1 to which a spray gun, generally indicated 3 and provided with a trigger 3a for controlling the flow of fluid passing through the gun, is fixed by means of a bracket 2.A tube for supplying pressurised fluid to the gun 3 is indicated 4.The fluid could be a disinfectant and or protective liquid intended for injection into structures of wood, stone or other materials. A delivery duct 5 connects the gun 3 to an annular chamber 6 formed in a feed ring 7 carried by the structure of the drill 1 and surrounding the chuck 8 of the drill itself.The annular chamber 6 is defined axially by washers 9 which ensure sealing between the feed ring 7 and the chuck 8, and communicates through radial holes 10 with an axial hole 11 of the chuck 8.The hole 11 is aligned with an inlet hole 12 formed in a twist bit 13 connected in known manner to the chuck 8.The hole 12 communicates with ducts 14 formed in the helical part of the bit and opening at its tip.In use of the device, a disinfectant and or protective liquid is supplied to the holes 14 of the bit during the drilling operation, thereby allowing the liquid to be injected into the material simultaneously with the drilling.
