# Method of forming contiguous self aligned implanted semiconductor regions and method of forming an integrated CMOS structure.

## Abstract
Contiguous self aligned ion implanted regions 48, 60 102, 106 are formed in a semiconductor wafer 40 90 by the steps of a implanting ions through an opening 46 100 in a first mask 44 98 formed on the wafer to produce a first ion implanted region 48 102 , b depositing a barrier layer 50 104 through the opening 46 100 in the first mask, c form ing a second mask 56 105 over the wafer and over the barrier layer, the second mask having a window 58 107 which exposes an edge portion of the barrier layer, the align ment of the window being non critical and d implanting ions through the window 58 107 in the second mask to produce a second ion implanted region 60 106 in the wafer, the second ion implanted region having an edge determined by the exposed edge of the barrier layer. An application of the method set out above is in the production of integrated CMOS structures. Thus active devices can be formed in the first ion implanted region and the second ion implanted region can serve as a field isolation region.
