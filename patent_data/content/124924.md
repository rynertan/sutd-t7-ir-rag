# Semiconductor devise for generating electromagnetic radiation.

## Abstract
A semiconductor LED or laser, having an active layer shaped region 1 composed of a layer structure comprising active layers 4 and barrier layers 5 . The layer structure constitutes a super lattice structure. Both the active layers 4 and the barrier layers 5 consist of either a stoichoimetric semiconductor compound or a semiconductor element. According to the invention, the active layers 4 each consist of n mono layers and the barrier layers 5 each consist of m mono layers, where 2 n 7,2 m 7 and n m 12, in order to obtain an optimum combination of zone folding effect and quantum well effect. Thus, lasers and LED s for wave lengths in the visible part of the spectrum can be real ized.
