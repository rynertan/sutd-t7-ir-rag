# Phase locked semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A phase locked semiconductor laser device comprising a laminated structure in which the active regions are vertically arrayed and comprise a plurality of first semi conductor layers 3, 5, 7 having substantially the same composition as each other, stacked so as to be sandwiched between second semiconductor layers 2,4,6,8, having a band gap wider, and a refractive index lower, than those of said first semiconductor layers, forming cladding layers. A third semiconductor layer 9 is disposed in contact with at least one of the side faces of said laminated structure 2 8 parallel to the direction of travel of a laser beam, and is not narrower in band gap and not higher in the refractive index than said first semiconductor layers 3,5,7 and does not have the same conductivity type as, at least, that of said first semiconductor layers. Electrodes 10, 11 inject current into an interface between said first semiconductor layers 3,5,7 and said third semiconductor layer 9 . Cleaved faces 12,12 act as an optical resonator for the laser beam. Laser beams from the plurality of active regions have coherent wavelengths and phases, and a high optical output.
