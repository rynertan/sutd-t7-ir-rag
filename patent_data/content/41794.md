# Intrusion detection system and detectors useful therein.

## Abstract
A fence type intrusion detection system is described comprising a group of tensioned wires 8 having a common actuator 24 adapted to actuate a detector 14 upon a change in tension in any of the wires 8 . Also described is a detector 14 in the form of a ceramic piezoelectric force transducer which outputs an electrical signal proportional to the force applied by the actuator 24 .
