## Description
A method of leaching lithium values from a brinecontaminated resin aluminate composite. The present invention pertains to a method for obtaining a high purity lithium halide solution from a resin aluminate composite. U.S. Patents 4,116,856 4,116,858 and 4,159,311 disclose preparation of, and use for, ion exchange resins having incorporated therein crystalline LiX 2A1 OH 3, where X is halide, especially chloride. When resin aluminate composites are employed to absorb Li ions from brines by having the Li taken up into the aluminate crystals, there still remains in the interstices of the composite some of the brine from which the Li ions have been absorbed. When the brine contains other metal ions i.e., other than alkali metal ions such as alkaline earth metal ions, then when an aqueous wash is employed to elute desired Li ions from the crystals, the effluent also contains these other metal ions which were in the interstices but which were not in the crystal structure. It has now been found that the use of a concentrated pure Na halide brine washing step before the water washing step used for Li leaching, results in washing out the metal ions such as alkaline earth metal ions without leaching out a significant amount of the Li in the aluminate crystals. Then when water is employed to leach out the Li in the aluminate crystals, the only other metal ions present in any appreciable amount in the effluent are those of the Na halide brine. In accordance with the present invention, concentrated, relatively pure, Na halide brine is used as a pre wash before the water leaching of Li values from a composite comprising an ion exchange resin having incorporated therein a crystalline lithium halide aluminate composition. Thus the Na halide which is washed from the interstices of the composite by the water leaching is mostly present in the initial portions of the effluent and in decreasing amounts in the subsequent portions of lithium halide solution. Thus there is obtained a lithium halide solution which contains only Na halide as an impurity in significant amount. The resin aluminate composites , used in the present invention are preferably prepared by incorporating crystalline LiX 2Al OH 3 where X is halide into ion exchange resins, as are shown in the references listed supra, including the heavily loaded resins described in copending application U.S. Serial No. 095,691, which was filed November 19, 1979. As used herein, the halide of the expression Na halide or LiX refers to C1, Br, or I, withCl being preferred. For simplicity in this disclosure the halide will be shown as the preferred chloride, with the understanding that bromide or iodide is also suitable. The relatively pure.Na halide brine, hereinafter referred to as NaCl brine for purposes of conciseness, may also be taken to mean an alkali metal halide brine other than lithium halide brine, though a small amount of Li in the NaCl brine is beneficial. It is this relatively pure, but concentrated, NaCl brine which is used as the pre wash for the lithium loaded resin aluminate composite before the water leaching step the water leaching step is done to remove much of the Li values from the composite but not all of the Li values , thereby substantially unloading the composite. This concentrated NaCl brine is preferably at or near saturation, but any concentration above about 20 percent should provide a reasonably efficient operation. At further reduced concentrations the operation becomes less and less efficient.From a practical standpoint to achieve an economical and efficient operation, the concentration is preferably from 24 percent to 26 percent. The Li containing aqueous solution or brine solution from which Li ions are desirably removed are those which are contaminated with metal ions other thanLi or alkali metal ions. These other metal ions are usually alkaline earth metal ions, such as Mg , Ca etc., but may also be virtually any other non alkali metal cation. The Li loaded resin aluminate composites, having in the interstices thereof any contaminating metal cations other than alkali metal cations, would ordinarily be derived from a process wherein a substantially unloaded composite is used to absorb or take up Li ions from an impure brine, thereby becoming loaded with Li ions. Obviously, though, any suchLi loaded resin aluminate having the 1,other metal cations in the interstices thereof may be used in the present process.The purpose and intent of the present process is to remove the contaminating metal cations from the interstices without removing a significant amount of the Li ions this is done by using a relatively pure, preferably concentrated NaCl pre wash which leaves the Li ions in place, but which leaves the interstices filled with the relatively pure NaCl brine which is essentially devoid of the said contaminating metal cations. When water leaching is subsequently employed to remove Li from the composite, the initial portions of effluent wash out much of the NaCl and some of the subsequent portions comprise substantially pure Li solu tions having NaCl as virtually the only contaminant. it is preferable than not all the Li be removed from the crystalline LiX 2Al OH 3 because removal of all the Li can cause collapse or destruction of the crystalline aluminate structure. Therefore it is best if the water which is used for water leaching contains a small amount of Li say, at least about 80 ppm as this prevents total removal of Li from the aluminate structure. It is believed that the greater the concentration of NaCl in the solution, the greater is the tendency for the crystalline aluminate structure to adsorb, and hold, the Li values. Upon water leaching, the concentration of NaC1 in the interstices of the composite is reduced and as the reduction is occurring, the Li is becoming more and more leachable from the crystal. One of the techniques by which Li values are removed from aqueous solution is by precipitation as lithium carbonate Li2CO3 . If other metal cations, such as alkaline earth metal cations, are present they may also precipitate as carbonates along with the lithium. Sodium carbonate does not precipitate with the lithium carbonate, therefore NaCl in the Li solution does not pose the same contamination problems as the other metal cations. Furthermore, if NaCl is the only contaminant in the Li solution, the NaC1 can be crystallized by evaporation of most of the water, leaving a pure concentrated LiC1 solution this would not be possible with the alkaline earth metals. The water used for water leaching the Li from the aluminate structure in the composite should be substantially devoid of other metal cations such as alkaline earth metal cations except that a small amount of Li should be present, for purposes stated supra. Also a small amount of other alkali metal cations, such as Na may be tolerated Deionized softened water may be used as well as distilled water or other reasonably pure water, so long as there is no substantial amount of alkaline earth metal or other non alkali metal cations present. The following examples are given to illustrate certain embodiments, though the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated. In the following example, the water leaching step is performed using deionized water containing about 68 ppm Li ions. The crude impure Li containing feed brine from which Li ions are to be extracted is a mineral brine from the Smackover deposit near Magnolia,Arkansas which was substantially saturated with NaCl and which contained, nominally about 280 ppm Li ions, about 6.2 percent Na , about 17.05 percent Cl , about 0.41 percent K , about 0.31 percent Mug , about 3.3 percent Ca , about 0.23 percent Sr , about 0.022 percentB , about 20 30 ppm Mn , about 20 30 ppm Mo , and about 9 10 ppm Cu its pH was about 5.8.The substantially pure NaCI brine used as a pre wash before water leaching was saturated, contained about 200 ppm Li ions, and was about 6.3 pH. The resin aluminate composite was a weak base anion exchange resin, available commercially from The Dow Chemical Company under the tradename DOWEXMWA 1, into which had been incorporated crystalline LiCl 2Al OH 3. The vessel employed was a glass ion exchange column of 120 cc volume which was jacketed for temperature control by circulating fluid.Example 1 The ion exchange column was filled with the resin aluminate composite which had been water leached to substantially unload the composite with respect to its Li content. At a temperature of about 770C and a flow rate of 10 cc min., the crude feed brine was passed through the composite bed until the total hardness Mg Ca , etc. , as determined by standard versene method, was the same entering and leaving the column. Then a relatively pure saturated NaCl brine pre wash was used to displace the crude feed brine remaining in the interstices of the composite the pre wash was passed through at 3.3 cc min. until the amount of hardness in the effluent was less than 0.002 M. Following that the water leaching step was done, using water flow at 3.3 cc min. The effluent from the column was taken as cuts for analysis of density, molar hardness, and ppmLi . Table I demonstrates the elution pattern for one cycle of loading brine wash leaching. It will be readily understood by persons skilled in these arts that the unloaded composite may be employed in numerous such cycles.

The procedure of Example 1 above is substantially followed except that the exchange column bed was 170 cc volume, the resin composite contained a higher loading of the LiCl 2Al OH 3 crystalline material such as prepared substantially in accordance with the process disclosed in copending application U.S. Serial No. 095,961, the temperature of the column was 900C, the flor rate was 2.5 percent of bed volume per minute, and the water wash contained about 60 ppm LiAfter passing enough of the Smackover brine through the resin aluminate composite to load the composite withLi values, the water leaching step was conducted without a NaCl solution pre wash.As can be seen from the data in Table II below, the peak cuts for Li concentration contained a substantial amount of hardness values.

A pre wash of pure, saturated NaCl brine was passed through the bed at a flow rate of 2.75 percent of bed volume per minute and the effluent collected in cuts.After about 0.83 bed volumes of the pre wash, the bed was flushed with deionized water containing 280 ppm Li for 1.66 bed volumes and the effluent collected in cuts. Then the flow of Smackover brine was resumed at a flow rate of 8.2 percent bed volumes per minute to recharge or nreloadn the resin composite with lithium. Table III shows the elution data.

The remaining cuts were used as follows, most of them being used in a concentrating cycle, which data is shown in Table IV below. Cuts 1 6 were recycled back to the feed tank.Cuts 7, 8 and 9 were combined and flowed through a resin aluminate bed to load the Li into the resin. Cuts 10 13 were combined and passed through the resin bed.Cuts 14 15 were combined and passed through the resin bed. Then 33 cc of fresh make up brine was passed through two replace portions of cuts 7 15 which had been lost or taken out through samplings. Cuts 16 and 17 were combined, saturated with NaC1 and passed through the bed. Cuts 18 21 were saved as product samples. Cuts 22 23 were combined and then passed through the bed. A make up quantity 34 cc of 280 ppm Li deionized water was passed through the bed.The data are in Table IV.

This preferred method of operating, then, involves utilizing portions of the effluent in succeeding runs. This could be accomplished by storing the effluent in a coil or a succession of tanks to approximate the gradients. Thus the only new feed needed for each elution cycle would be a make up amount of fresh deionized water containing a small amount of Li , equivalent in volume to the product cut, and enough NaCl to resaturate a portion of the gradient to be called reflux . By successive operations, using Li containing cuts from prior runs, the concentration of the product is increased above that possible in a single cycle. Referring to the cuts of Table IV above, the first 6 cuts, being relatively high in hardness and low in Li, are recycled back to the Smackover brine feed. Cuts 7, 8 and 9 are combined and are used as the first solution pumped into a column to elute an equivalent volume of Smackover brine. Cuts 10, 11 and 12 are combined and pumped through after the 7,8,9 mixture. This is then followed with a solution made by mixing 13, 14, 15 and 16 then 17, 18 and 19 are resaturated with NaCl and pumped into the column. Cuts 20, 21, 22 and 23 were saved as product. Cuts 24 30 were combined to follow the reflux mixture of 17,18,19. Next a volume of 280 ppm Li deionized water equivalent to volume of product cuts follows the 24 30 cut mixture. The effluent for all this was collected in cuts as before to use in a subsequent concentrating cycle. This procedure was followed until by the fifth cycle, the product cut had increased from 3912 ppm Li first cycle to 5531 ppmLi fifth cycle , with little or no increase in total hardness.
