# Apparatus for buffing and non destructive testing of tyres.

## Abstract
Apparatus for buffing and for non destructively testing a buffed tire carcass comprising two circular rings 108, 110 which sealingly engage the rims of a tire 112 which is to be tested. The tyre can be inflated by means of an inflation device 102 after it is engaged by the rings. The tire can be rotated and as it is rotated a buffing device 200 buffs away the outer tread wall to provide a substantially uniform outer tread wall surface. The tire can be tested by means of ultrasonic transmitters 500, 502 which transmit ultrasonic signals through the tire wall and ultrasonic receivers 210 which sense the transmitted signals.
