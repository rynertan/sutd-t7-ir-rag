# A recliner mechanism for use in a recliner chair.

## Abstract
A three position recliner and a three position rocker recliner are disclosed wherein the body support 12 includ ing the seat 13 and backrest 14 of both recliners are movable between upright, intermediate or TV and full re cline positions. Both recliners include a mechanism oper able upon release of a latch 85 to move the body support 12 of the recliner between upright and TV positions as a consequence of the weight of a person sitting in the recliner propelling the body support to the TV position. Both re cliners utilize a common recliner linkage 16 to support the body support 12 from a fixed base 21, 203 . In the recliner, the recliner linkage 16 is mounted upon a forward biased four bar linkage mechanism 18 such that upon release of the latch, the four bar linkage 18 swings forwardly, propel ling the body support from the upright to the TV position. In the rocker recliner, this same recliner linkage 16 pivots about a front pivot 208 of a rocker base plate 205 and drops the rear of the seat upon release of the latch. Because identical recliner linkages are common to both recliner mechanisms, idential chair frames may be mounted upon either mechanism to create either a recliner or a rocker recliner.
