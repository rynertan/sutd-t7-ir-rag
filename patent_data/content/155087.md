# HAND HELD PIPETTE WITH DISPOSABLE CAPILLARY

## Abstract
A hand held manually operated pipette having an adjust able plunger stroke and calibrated electronic digital volumetric display 106 draws up and dispenses viscous, dense or high vapor pressure liquids by means of an easily replaced, dis posable integral, positive displacement type plunger tip 10 and capillary 11 assembly. The pipette in another form utilizes a disposable air displacement capillary. The plunger adjustably strokes to a first stop 51 in a first mode for calibration or sample draw up and dispensing with the volume of pipette liquid contents continuously displayed. In a second mode an over travel arrangement enables the plunger shaft 23 to stroke beyond the first stop to permit collet type attachment and ejection of the integral plunger tip and capillary for positive displacement service or to elect an air displacement capillary.
