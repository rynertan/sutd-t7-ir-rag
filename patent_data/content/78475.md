## Description
This invention relates to the transfer of toned electrostatic latent image from an electrophotographic member on which it is formed, to a secondary carrier. Xerographic processes have proved to be an easy and reliable technique for the production of reproductions. Notwithstanding the desirability of these imaging processes, drawbacks have been encountered in forming transparencies in that the adherence of the image on the transfer support leaves much to be desired. Additionally, some loss of optical density and resolution is experienced upon transfer of the toned image to a receiving member employing prior methods. With the advent of electrophotographic members of the kind disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,025,339 a resolution is obtained heretofore unobtainable by electrophotographic reproduction. It would be highly advantageous to transfer the toned image to a transparent member whereby to take advantage of the resolution obtained using said member. It is known from French published patent application 2 272 427 to transfer an electrostatically formed toner image to a transfer medium which has a thermo adhesive coating bonded to a substrate. The coating of this known transfer medium is sticky or tacky during heating and the toner particles are fixed to the surface of the transfer medium by the adhesive action of the coating on the substrate. The toner particles are not protected under a resinous coating but are bonded to the surface by the adhesive action. Furthermore, US defensice publication print T 879 009 discloses a transfer medium for receiving an electrostatically formed image of toner particles, said transfer medium comprising a substrate and a thin thermoplastic coating bonded to one surface of the substrate and being softenable for embedding said toner particles after transfer from a toned image carrier. The thermoplastic coating of the known transfer medium is of a kind which requires the toner image to be transferred not to be totally dry but containing a portion of the developing solvent therein. During a transfer process using this known transfer medium the thermoplastic coating could behave sticky and a so called ghost image remaining on the electrophotographic member, from which the toner particle image is to be transferred, could not be excluded after the transfer step. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a transfer medium for receiving an electrostatically formed image of toner particles, comprising a substrate and a thin thermoplastic coating bonded to one surface of said substrate and being softenable for embedding said toner particles after transfer from a toned image carrier in such manner that the thermoplastic coating would not behave as an adhesive layer, that the toner particle image is transferred totally from the toned image carrier and that the toner particles, after transfer, are completly embedded and protected. This object in accordance with the invention, is achieved by the characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous additional features are subject matter of claim 2 to 4. The preferred embodiments of this invention now will be described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings accompanying this specification in which The transfer medium according to the invention is adaptable particularly to received toned latent imgages formed upon an electrophotographic member of the type disclosed in United States Patent 4,025,339, which member is formed of a flexible substrate, preferably polyester, such as polyethylene glycol terphthalate, carrying a sandwich bonded thereto consisting of a thin film layer of ohmic material such as indium tin oxide and an r.f. sputter deposited thin coating of a photoconductive material selected from the group cadmium sulfide, etc. The photoconductive coating carried by the patented electrophotographic member consists of uniformly vertically oriented microcrystals to form a dense, abrasion resistant layer bonded to the ohmic layer earlier deposited on the substrate. The photoconductive layer possesses unique optical and electrical properties notably optical and electrical anisotropy, which enables the coating to be charged rapidly and to hold the charge sufficiently to enable toning subsequent to exposure to an image pattern of the subject matter to be reproduced. An electrostatic latent image of the subject matter to be reproduced is formed on the surface of the electrophotographic member and is made visible by toning. The characteristics of the coating enable unusually high resolution to be achieved and hence, encourage employment most advantageously, in the microcopier microfiche field. Transfer from the unique image carrier to a film material is required for storage and or display purposes such as a transparency. It would be highly advantageous that the expensive original electrophotographic member itself solely be used for imaging rather than also functioning as the record storage or a transparency per se. For that purpose it is necessary to provide a transfer medium for receiving the toned image and which can constitute a permanent record. Another reason for desiring that the record be made permanent upon a transfer medium rather than fusing the toned image to the electrophotographic member itself is that the member has a characteristic color which though transparent, detracts from the end product. To take advantage of the unusual and superior resolution properties, one must provide a transfer material capable of receiving the toned image without loss of resolution and without loss of optical density. Further, if the transfer is to be effected with full benefit of the imaging process, one would have to provide a transfer medium which will accept all the toned image without leaving any toner residue. One also desires to avoid formation of pin holes or voids in the image. Polyester substrate materials are preferred although other substrate materials are suitable, such as cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate and cellulose acetate butyrate. The preferred resins employed for the overcoating are thermoplastic polyester compositions, the chemical structures of which are similar to that of the preferred substrate manufactured and sold under the trademark MYLAR by the DuPont Company. The resins in organic solvent solutions are applied to the polyester substrate using conventional coating methods, such as reverse roll type or Meyer rod methods employing a wire wound rod . Suitable resins have softening point ranges from a low of 90 C to a high of 155 C. Suitable resins cannot have a tendency to adhere subsequently to other coated sheets, that is, form a block say after coating is completed. The solvents employed preferably have low toxicity characteristics. A combination of cellosolve acetate and cyclohexanone or methyl ethyl ketone and toluene can be employed as solvents. For the resin which has a softening point of about 127 C, a solution having a solids content of 7 to 10 percent by weight has been successfully employed. Where the softening ranges of the resin are in the 150 C range, a solution having 10 to 15 per cent by weight solids content in a solvent mixture of methylethyl ketone and toluene can be employed with satisfactory result. A solids content greater than 25 result in striated patterns formed in the coating and is unsatisfactory. The coatings of the lower softening range have a thickness between 2 to 15 µm, with 6 10 µm giving the best result. The thickness of resin coatings in the upper end of the applicable softening range, is about the same. The higher softening range resins are used generally with solvent mixtures such as Methyl Ethyl Ketone 20 parts and Toluene 80 parts. Nonfusible toners are preferred but color toners and self fusible toners can be utilized. It is important to recognize that the resin is selected so as to enable the toner particles to be embedded within the resin coating. Image transfer to the transfer medium of the invention may be effected by heating the receiving sheet and bringing the heated sheet superimposed over the toned image while simultaneously applying pressure to both sheets, the base and the superimposed transfer medium. The temperature to which the heated roller is raised for transfer to the transfer medium of the invention is about 140 . The temperature at which transfer occurs is between 127 C and 155 C at the coating. Transfer attempts at lower temperatures may result in incomplete transfer and or a remaind ghost image on the master sheet from which transfer is made. The preferred temperature is 140 C. After heat and pressure have been applied, the two sheets are separated, by peeling or pulling same apart. It has been found that no elevated toner image is formed but that the toner image has become embedded within the coating with no relief pattern being observed. The result is a high gloss, high resolution transparency. A sheet of 5 mil 1 mil 2.54 10 ⁵m polyethylene glycol terephthalate plastic sheeting conventionally heat stabilized Mylar Type M654 is coated with a 6 8 µm thick in dry state coating of a thermoplastic polyester resin No.46950 or No. 49000, sold by DuPont Company, Wilmington, Delaware similar to Mylar from a 1,1,2 trichloroethane solution or a solvent mixture such as cellosolve acetate 1 part and cyclohexanone 1 part and cyclohexanone 1 part respectively, thereof having concentration of 10 percent solids and the solvent evaporated, to form the transfer member of the invention. Similarly, coating solutions comprised of individual thermoplastic polyester resins Vitel PE 200, PE 222, VPE 4583A and VPE 5545A sold by The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Akron, Ohio , or combinations thereof, having a concentration of 15 percent solids, are satisfactory alternatives for preparation of the transfer member of the invention. The toned master is brought together with the coating side of the transfer sheet member at a nip between a heated roller and a relatively soft roller, the nip defining a narrow transverse band. In lieu of or in addition to a heated roller, one may apply a stream of hot air at the nip to heat the local area. Pressure is exerted simultaneously with the heating at the nip to no more than 170 C preferably 140 150 C . The critical lower temperature is just above the flow point of the resin coating. The critical higher temperature is below the softening range of the substrate. The soft pressure roller can be formed of a hard rubber having about an 80 durometer hardness. The two sheets are laminated at the nip, and immediately thereafter, the laminate is cooled at least to ambient temperature perhaps lower . The laminate was then separated by peeling, i.e. pulling one sheet from the other. The result is a transparency formed of the resin coated transparent substrate carrying the toner particles of the image actually embedded in the resin coating to define a flat image. The high gloss member has better than 80 per cent light transmission. The transfer temperature was 135 140 C with a transfer speed of approximately 3 inches 1 inch 2.54 10 ²m per second. A pressure of 60 pounds per square inch 1 psi 6.895 10 ²bar was applied. The transfer medium 10 is brought into engagement with the master electrophotographic member 18 carrying a dry toned image. The engagement is effected under heat and pressure, the heat emanating from heater roller 20 and the pressure exercised by soft rubber roller 22. The resin coating is thus softened so that the toner particles are embedded in the softened resin overcoat. In the Figures, the transparency formed in accordance with the invention is designated generally by reference character 10 and comprises a transparent substrate 12 of Mylar polymer sheet having an overcoating 14 formed by a resin compatible with Mylar substrate 12 capable of being softened at a temperature at which the Mylar substrate is unaffected. Using heat and pressure as heretofore described, the toner particles 16 representing the transferred image are embedded permanently in the resin overcoat 14. The laminate thus formed is rapidly cooled at cooling station 24 as soon as it is formed, the toner having greater adherence to the cooled resin than to the master electrophotographic member and hence remains embedded in the cooled resin. The laminate is separated immediately after cooling, at separating station 26. Although the cooling station 24 is provided, it is not mandatory positively to cool the laminate before separation. In Figure 3, an electrophotographic sheet 18 is illustrated in the process of peeling off from a sheet of transfer material 10 after cooling, forming the transparency. An important benefit arising from the invention herein is that when a negative type toned image is presented to the photoconductor, a negative image appears on the transfer medium and when a positive image is presented, the end transfer result is a positive image on said transfser medium.
