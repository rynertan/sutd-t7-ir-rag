Molding and extrusion grades are available in low, medium, and high melt flows as well as medium or high impact types, heat and ultraviolet radiation stable formulations, and resins with controlled crystallinity. Copolymerization with relatively small amounts, e.g., from about 1 to about 20 by weight, of other monomers, notably ethylene or other alpha olefin monomers, modifies the polypropylene structure and provides polymers with improved impact properties and reduced brittleness temperatures. The polyetherimides for the blends of the invention can be obtained by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art including the reaction of any aromatic bis ether anhydrides of the formulaEMI4.1 where Z is as defined hereinbefore with an organic diamine of the formula H2N R NH2 where R is as defined hereinbefore.

Institute of Heteroorganic compounds, Academy of Sciences, U.S.S.R. , U.S.S.R.257,010, ov. 11, 1969, Appl. May 3, 1967. In addition, dianhydrides are shown by M.M. Koton, F.S. Florinski,Zh Org. Khin, 4 5 , 774 1968 . Organic diamines of the above formula include, for example, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, benzidine, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1 ,5 dianiino naphthalene, 3,3 dimenthylbenzidine, 3,3 dimethoxy benzidine, 2,4 bis ss amino t butyl toluene, bis p amino t butylphenyl ether, bis p A methyl o aminopentyl benzene, 1,3 diamino 4 isopropylbenzene, l,2 bis 3 amino propoxy ethane, m xylylenediamine, p xylylenediamine, 2,4 diaminotoluene, 2,6 diaminotoluene, bis 4 aminocyclo hexyl methane, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 4 4,4 dimethyl heptamethylenediamine, 2,11 dodecadiamine, 2,2 dimethylopropylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 3 methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,5dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 5 methylnonamethylenedediamine, 1, 4 cyclohexane diamine, 1,12 octadecanediamine, bis 3 aminopropoxy sulfide,N methyl bis 3 aminopropyl amine, hexamethylenediame, heptamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane, bis 4 aminobutyl tetramethyldisiloxane , etc. In general, the reactions can be advantageously carried out employing well known solvents, e.g., o dichlorobenzene, m cresol toluene, etc. in which to effect interaction between the dianhydrides and the diamines, at temperatures of from about 100 to about 250 C. Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the above dianhydrides with any of the above diamino compounds while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200 to 400 C. and preferably 230 to 300 C. can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equimolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups Generally, useful polyetherimides have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.35 to 0.60. or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 25 C. Included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. Heath et al, 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takekoshi et al 3,850,885, white 3,852,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. Suitable polypropylene and its copolymers, as defined previously, can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art or can be obtained commercially.Conventional example, methods for forming polypropylene and copolymers thereof are discussed in the previously mentioned section of the Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia ofChemical Technology. For example, commercial polypropylenes are generally prepared using a solid, crystalline, hydrocarbon insoluble catalyst made from a titanium trichloride composition and an aluminum alkyl compound, e.g., triethyl aluminum or diethyl aluminum chloride. Depending on the specific catalyst and polymerization conditions employed, the polymer produced may contain atactic as well as isotactic, syndiotactic or so called stero block molecules.These can be separated, if desired, by selective solvent extraction to yield products of low atactic content that crystallize more completely. In accordance with the present invention, particularly useful blends of a polyetherimide and polypropylene are obtained when the blends contain a minor proportion of polypropylene. Such blends have a higher notched impact strength than that associated with the polyetherimide component of the blend as well as those of blends not containing a minor proportion of polypropylene.Consequently, blends comprising from about 80 to about 99 , by weight, polyetherimide and from about 20 to about 1 by weight, polypropylene, preferably from about 85 to 95 polyetherimide and from about 15 to about 5 wt. X polypropylene, are included within the scope of the invention. In general, blends of polyetherimides and polypropylene within the above range can be tailored to provide desired physical characteristics by selecting appropriate proportion of blend components. Relatively higher proportions of polyetherimide within the range usually contribute higher mechanical properties and higher heat deflection temperatures for the blend. Higher proportions of polypropylene, within limits, generally provide higher impact strength for the blend. The unique characteristics of the blends of the present invention are illustrated in the drawing in which the soleFigure is a plot of notched impact strength versus polyetherimide content for a series of blends of a polyetherimide and a polypropylene. The Figure is discussed in greater detail below with reference to Example I. It is contemplated that the polyetherimide polypropylene blends of the present invention may also include additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, flexibilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. It is also contemplated that the blends of the invention may include two or more polyetherimides with one or more of polypropylene and its copolymers. Methods for forming polyetherimide polypropylene type blends of the invention may vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular or filamentous form, extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermoplastic compositions. The polyetherimide polypropylene blends of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, and at high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, cable and coil wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures. Films made from the subject polyetherimide polypropylene blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc. and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated temperatures to remove the solvent and provide a continuous resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blends include their use as binders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends of the invention by incorporating such fillers, as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica, and the like into the blends prior to molding.Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. The following examples illustrate specific polyetherimide polypropylene or polyetherimide polypropyleneco polymer blends in accordance with the present invention.It should be understood that the examples are given for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention. In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I A series of polyetherimide polypropylene blends, some according to the invention and some outside the invention, were prepared, the blends molded into test specimens and the specimens tested for various physical properties. The polyetherimide of the blends was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxy phenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 250C to about 300 C. and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer was extruded at about 3000C. to form a strand and mechanically chopped into pellets. A test specimen of the polyetherimide was injection molded from the pellets at a temperature of about 685 700eF. The physical properties of the polyetherimide are set forth in the first line of the following Table I. The polypropylene used in preparing the blends was a heat resistant polypropylene sold under the tradenamePolypropylene 6524 by Hercules, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware.This polypropylene alone, according to literature, has the properties set forth at the bottom of Table I. To form the blend, about 90 parts of the above polyetherimide were mixed with about 10 parts of the polypropylene. The mixture of the two polymers was then extruded in a Werner BR Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from about 580 to 6300F and a die temperature of about 600 F. The resulting extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded into test specimens in aBattenfield molding machine at a temperature of about 550 F to 600 F. The impact strength of these specimens were measured according to the unnotched and notched Izod impact test and the results are set forth in the following Table I.The heat distortion temperature, flexural proporties and tensile properties of the blend were also determined and are given in Table I. The above procedure for preparing the blend was then repeated to produce test specimens of four additional blends having varying amounts of polyetherimide relative to the polypropylene. The results of the unnotched and notched Izod impact test, as well as the heat distortion temperature, flexural properties, and tensile properties for these blends are detailed in Table I.

Tested according to ASTM method D 790 using a 3.2mm bar at a 1.27 mm min crosshead speed.4. Tested according to ASTM method D 638 using a Type I bar with a 5.00 mm min crosshead speed.5. From published data In the accompanying drawing, the notched Izod impact strength values from Table I is plotted versus relative concentration of the components of the blends. From the plot, it can be observed that small amounts of polypropylene result in significantly higher notched impact strength values. However, after this initial rise, the notched impact values decrease significantly to about 50 50 blend level after which the values remain relatively constant. Of significance is the fact that the blend containing about 10X polypropylene has a notched Izod impact strength significantly above that of the polyetherimide alone and for blends containing more than about 30 polypropylene. EXAMPLE II The basic procedure of Example I was repeated with the exception that a polypropylene copolymer sold under the tradename Polypropylene Copolymer 8501 by Hercules was used. In addition, the extruder temperature profile varied from about 545 to 600 F and the die temperature used was about 600eF. As in Example I, test specimens of each blend were tested for notched and unnotched Izod impact strength as well as for heat distortion temperature, flexural properties and tensile properties. These test results for the various blends are set forth in Table II.

The above data presented in Table II Confirms that a minor amount, e.g., about 10 of polypropylene or copolymer thereof, in a blend with a polyetherimide provides a material which has an unexpectedly high notched impact strength. More specifically, it may be observed that the notched Izod impact strength for the 10 polypropylene copolymer blend is about 18 greater than that for the polyetherimide alone and about 95 greater than that for the blend containing 30 polypropylene copolymer. It is contemplated that substitution of other polyetherimides and or other polypropylenes for the polyetherimide and or polypropylenes in the blends of the above examples may result in the formulation of polymer blends having similar characteristics and such blends are considered within the scope of the invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
