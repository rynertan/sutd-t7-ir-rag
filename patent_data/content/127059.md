# Demetallization of hydrocarbon containing feed streams.

## Abstract
Metals contained in a hydrocarbon containing feed stream are removed by contacting the hydrocarbon contain ing feed stream under suitable demetallization conditions with hydrogen and a catalyst composition comprising zir conium phosphate and chromium phosphate. The life and activity of the catalyst composition may be increased by introducing a decomposable metal compound selected from the group consisting of the metals of Group V B. Group VI B. Group VII B and Group VIII of the Periodic Table into the hydrocarbon containing feed stream prior to contacting the hydrocarbon containing feed stream with the catalyst com position.
