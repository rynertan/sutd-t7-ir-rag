## Description
REFRIGERATOR COMPRESSOR SYSTEM AND MOTOR PROTECTOR UNIT THEREFORBackground of the Invention The field of this invention is that of electrical motors and the invention relates more particularly to the use of cur rent and temperature responsive motor protectors for protecting electrical motors against overheating in certain types of refrigerator compressor systems. Hermetically sealed refrigerator compressor systems typically mount a refrigerator compressor and an electrical motor for operating the compressor within a fluid filled, hermetically sealed container. Lead through pins extend through a wall of the container in sealed, electrically insulated relation to the wall and to each other to electrically connect the motor in an electrical circuit for operating the compressor. A motor protector is mounted on the motor inside the container by use of a bracket or the like to be thermally responsive to rise in temperature of the motor such as might result from the occurrence of a fault condition in the motor.Typically, the protector is also connected in the motor circuit in such a way that it is responsive to overcurrent conditions in the motor such as might result from such fault conditions to also interrupt operation of the motor for preventing overheating of the motor. The mounting of the motor protector on the motor within the container is typically performed by the manufacturer of the refrigerator compressor system using motor protector means furnished by another manufacture and typically involves considerable inconvenience and expense.It can also result in arranging the motor protector in a non uniform manner on the motor such that the motor may provide improper protection or may cause nuisance tripping in the system.Brief Summary of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide a novel and improved hermetically sealed refrigerator compressor system to provide such a system utilizing a rotary type of compressor within the hermetically sealed container of the system to provide such a system which is characterized by the ease and convenience of its assembly and of the reliability of its thermal and current response properties and to provide a novel and improved motor protector unit for use in such a refrigerator compressor system. Briefly described, the novel and improved refrigerator compressor system of this invention includes a rotary type of refrigerator compressor. That type of compressor and an electrical motor for operating the compressor are arranged within a fluid filled, hermetically sealed container in a generally conventional manner. In that regard, it is found that when a rotary type of refrigerator compressor is used within such an hermetically sealed fluid filled container, operation of the compressor by an electrical motor tends to produce a temperature level within the container which is substantially uniformed throughout all parts of the container.That is, while that temperature is subject to change, such as a rise in temperature on the occurrence of an overcurrent or other fault condition in the system, such a temperature change tends to be rapidly reflected in a change in said uniform temperature level throughout all parts of the sealed system container. Therefore, in accordance with this invention, a thermal and current responsive motor protector means of a generally conventional type is mounted within the system container on lead through pins which extend through the container wall. In that arrangement, the protector is easily and economically connected in the motor circuit and the protector is positioned so it is promptly responsive to a selected rise in the substantially uniformed temperature within the container for protecting the motor against overheating.That is, the thermal response characteristics of the motor protector are selected so it is adapted to interrupt operation of the electrical motor in response to a selected rise in said substantially uniformed temperature which results in a sealed system from operation of a rotary type of compressor within that sealed container, thereby to protect the motor against overheating within the container.Prefer ably the motor protector is mounted within a motor protector unit which includes a cluster block having means for contacting the respective lead through pins, having leads and terminals extending from the cluster block for electrically connecting the pins to the motor, and a motor protector element which is mounted on the cluster block to be located in selected position in the system container when the block is mounted on the pins. The use of such a motor protector unit further facilitates odnvenient and economical assembly of the refrigerator compressor system while assuring proper thermal and current response by the protector for preventing overheating of a motor within the system.

In accordance with this invention, the compressor 12 is of a conventional rotary type, that type of compressor having been found to provide a temperature level within such a fluid filled hermetically sealed container which is substantially uniform throughout all parts of the container 16 during normal operation of the compressor 12 by the motor 14 as well as during undesirable increases in that temperature such as might result from operation of the motor during the occurrence of various fault conditions in the compressor system. Preferably for example, the compressor 12 is of a rotary type as described in Handbook 1983Equipment, Part III Chapter 12, Published by ASHRAE 1983 and the compressor is arranged to be operated by a conventional electrical motor disposed within the sealed container 16 in a conventional manner.Preferably also the fluid fill coolant 18 comprises a conventional dielectric coolant fluid such as freon gas or the like which is maintained under pressure within the container 16 in conventional manner.
