## Description
Bus Precharge Circuit For MOS Integrated ComponentsDescription The present invention relates to a load circuit implemented with MOS transistors and particularly suited for the precharge of a bus of a MOS integrated circuit. By bus of an integrated circuit in MOS technology we intend a known configuration of the prevailing logic level kind, as depicted inFig. 1. The bus physical line is denoted by BB and supplies a logic output level VouT MOS transistor TL is used as a load and receives supply voltage VDD at the drain. The source of TL is connected to bus BB, while the gate receives logic signal Vp hereinafter referred to as precharge signal of node NB which presets transistor TL to conduction i.e. it presets the voltage on the bus to the non prevailing logic level. In the non limiting example here described non prevailing logic level is 1 . TAl,TA2... TAN denote N transistors in MOS technology enabling logic signal transfers on bus BB. Said transistors have drains connected to bus BB and receive on corresponding gates enabling signals V1,V2,...VN which preset corresponding transistors to conduction. T1,T2,...TN denote other N transistors in MOS technology for the transfer of logic signals A,B,...N, applied to corresponding gates, on the corresponding drains in turn connected to sources of corresponding enabling transistors TA1,... TAN. The sources of transistors T1,T2,...TN are grounded. During the time intervals in which precharge signal Vp, which presets to conduction transistor TL, is active, the circuit of Fig. 1 executes the following logic function VOUT V1 A V2 B ..... VN N where symbol indicates the logic AND and symbol the logic OR. The complemented value is determined by the intrinsically inverting structure of the circuit of Fig. 1, since between gate and drain of each transistor an inversion of phase and hence of logic level occurs. If one of signals A,...N passes to prevailing logic level, the corresponding branch of circuit in Fig. 1 conducts, as well as transistor TL voltage VOUT on bus BB passes also to prevailing logic level. In the non limiting example of Fig. 1, all the tranistors are n channel MOS transistors. In known circuits TL is an enhancement MOS transistor, because such a type of transistor has a higher switching speed and hence dissipates less than a depletion MOS transistor not convenient to be used in this case. However an enhancement MOS transistor introduces a gate source voltage drop equal to its threshold voltage VGST VGST depends on the process used to manufacture transistors, and has a minimum value equal to about 0.8 1.2 V. This threshold voltage VGST reduces the voltage swing on bus BB, since VOUT VDD VGST hence it decreases noise immunity of high logic level on bus BB, which noise immunity would be maximum if VOUT VDD, otherwise possibile if TL were a depletion MOS tran sistor. Then increased speed and low dissipation are counterbalanced by worse noise immunity. Then in accordance with the present invention the circuit of Fig. 1 is modified as shown in Fig. 2 transistor TL is replaced by the parallel of two MOS transistors TL1 of the enhancement type and TL2 of the depletion type. TL1 and TL2 drains are connected to voltage supply VDD sources to bus BB, and gates to precharge voltage Vp. So, the advantage is obtained of noise immunity due to the presence of the depletion MOS transistor, which keeps VOUT VDD. The advantages of higher speed and less dissipation are also obtained since most of the drain current is made to flow in the enhancement MOS transistor. More particularly1 drain current in both transistor types depends on the ratio K W L, where W and L are channel width and lenght respectively. Hence the physical sizes of depletion MOS transistor TL2 are kept small, while those of enhancement MOS transistor TL1 are rendered proportional to desired drain current so that most of said current may flow through enhancement transistor TL1. Modifications and variations to the just described embodiment are possible without going out of the scope of the invention.
