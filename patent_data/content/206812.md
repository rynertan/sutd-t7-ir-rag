# CATHODE RAY TUBE APPARATUS CATHODE RAY TUBE APPARATUS

## Abstract
A structure for cooling a cathode ray tube apparatus 10 for projecting colour images includes a cooling medium 28 contained in a space 17 defined by a front panel 11A of the cathode ray tube 11 , an outer front panel or lens 27 , and a metallic frame 12 , for transferring heat from the cathode ray tube 11 to the frame 12 . An air or expansion chamber 29 communicates with the cooling medium space 17 to permit expansion of the heated cooling medium 28 into the expan sion chamber 29 , while preserving the distance between the front panel 11A of the cathode ray tube 11 and the outer front panel or lens 27 .
