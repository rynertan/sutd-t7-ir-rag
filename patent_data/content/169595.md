# Semiconductor device comprising a non volatile storage transistor.

## Abstract
A non volatile storage cell having a floating conductive layer 11 12, 13 which is coupled to an injector region 14 which is located in the semiconductor body 1 and, viewed on the surface 2 , is entirely enclosed by a thick insulating layer, 6 said injector region 14 being connected to an electrode region 4 of the storage transistor by a semicon ductor zone 16, 17 lying below said thick insulating layer 6 . The injector region 14 is doped more weakly than the semiconductor zone 16, 17 and at least a part of the edge 18 of the semiconductor zone 16, 17 follows in a self registered manner an edge 7 of the thick insulating layer 6 . Furthermore, the floating conductive layer 11, 12, 13 is located for at least half its size on the thick insulating layer 6 .
