# Noise erasing apparatus for stimulable phosphor sheet.

## Abstract
An apparatus for erasing the fog, such as environmental radiations, developing in a stimulable phosphor sheet used for a radiation image recording and reproducing system in which a radiation image is once recorded in the stimulable phosphor sheet and then read out and reproduced on a recording material. The apparatus comprises a power supply to the illuminant for emitting erasing light, and a power controller connected between the power source and illumi nant for maintaining the power supplied at the predeter mined constant value to keep the luminance and colour temperature of the illuminant constant.
