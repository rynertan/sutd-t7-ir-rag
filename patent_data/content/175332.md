## Description
HERBICIDE COMPOSITIONS OF EXTENDED SOIL LIFE Cross Reference to Related Applications This application is a continuation in part of Application SerialNo. 652,710, filed September 19, 1984. Background of the Invention This invention relates to herbicidal compositions and methods of use. In particular, this invention relates to herbicidal canpositions comprising an herbicidally effective anount of a thiolcarbanate herbicide in canbination with an extending amount of an extender canpound. An extender canpound is a certain thiolcarbamate, thiolcarbanate sulfone, thiolcarbanate sul fox ide, thionocarbanate, dithiocarbamate or carbanate compound disclosed herein. An extender serves to prolong the effectiveness of single or multiple applications of the thiolcarbanate herbicide in controlling undesired plant growth. Thiolcarbamates are well known in the agricultural art as herbicides useful for weed control in crops such as corn, potatoes, beans, beets, spinach, tobacco, tanatoes, alfalfa, rice, peanuts and soybeans anong others. Thiolcarbanates are primarily used in pre emergence application. They have been found to be particularly effective when incorpo rated into the soil prior to the planting of the crop. As a herbicide, the thiolcarbanate is most concentrated immediately after its application.How long thereafter the initial concentration is retained depends in large part on the particular soil used. Thus the rate at which the thiolcarbamate herbicide concentration declines following its application tends to vary frn one type of soil to the next. Ihis is evident in the observable extent of actual weed control after considerable time has elapsed. The extender canpounds of the instant invention extend the soil life of thiolcarbanate herbicides in soil which has been treated one or more times before with a thiolcarbanate herbicide or in soil which has had no previous treatment with a thiolcarbanate herbicide. Soil which has been previously treated with a thiolcarbanate herbicide is termed pretreated soil whereas soil which has not been so treated is termed non pretreated soil. Under certain environmental and other conditions, thiolcarbamate herbicides are degraded more rapidly in pretreated soil of certain types than in non pretreated soil. Such pretreated soil is considered conditioned to degrade thiolcarbanates herbicides at an accelerated rate pared to non pretreated soil. The extenders of the instant invention prevent rapid soil degradation of thiolcarbanate herbicide. tibet only do the extenders prevent the rapid soil degradation of thiolcarbanate herbicides in pretreated soil, but also prolong the herbicidally effective soil life of thiolcarbanate herbicides in non pretreated soil. The soil in many of the examples below showing activity of representative extenders of the instant invention has been pretreated.Such pretreatment is designed to simulate field conditions wherein a field has been repeatedly treated with a thiolcarbanate herbicide. This simulation is effected by retreating the experimental soil, employed herein within weeks of the first treatment rather than seasons later as in the fields. Such a short experimental retreatment period highly conditions the soil. The improvement in the soil persistence of the thiolcarbanate herbicide effected by the extender compound can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Improved soil persistence can be shown by herbicidal efficacy tests, wherein the degree of weed injury is measured after a set period of time following application of the herbicide. In such a test, the extender compound is shown to increase the h. rbicidal effectiveness of the thiolcarbanate by increasing the persistence of the latter in the soil, and thus prolonging its effective life. Several of the thiolcarbanate extenders within the scope of the instant invention are specifically disclosed as phytocides in GreatBritain Patent Specification No. 862,548 Tilles et al., published parch 1961 and as herbicides in U.S. Patent Ms. 2,989,393 and 2,916,370. However, in all three of these references the rates in lb acre at which the compounds were applied are very high compared to canmercial appi ica tion rates and those employed in the examples herein. Similarly, thiol carbanates related to the extenders of the instant invention are disclosed as herbicides when applied at very high rates in U.S. Patent Nubs. 2,901,498 and 2,916,369. Nowhere in any of the above cited patent references is the problem of rapid soil degradation of thiolcarbamate herbicides even mentioned nor is the extension of soil life of thiolcarbanates referred to anywhere therein. For a thiolcarbanate, thiolcarbanate sulfone, thiolcarbanate sulfaxide, thionocarbamate, dithiocarbanate or carbanate compound to be considered an extender of this invention, it is highly desirable for there to be a significant difference between the herbicidal activity of the extender when tested alone and the herbicidal activity of the thiolcarbamate and extender composition, when applied at the sane rate and by the sane method. Summary of the Invention This invention comprises a novel herbicidal composition of extended soil life, canprising an herbicidally effective amount of a thiolcarbanate herbicide and an extending anount of a thiolcarbanate, thiolcarbanate sulfone, thiolcarbanate sul fox ide, thionocarbanate, dithio carbanate or carbanate extender compound. In a preferred embcdiment, the composition of this invention includes a substantially nonphytotoxic, antidotally effective amount of a thiolcarbanate herbicide antidote. Such prolongation of the thiolcarbanate herbicide 5 activity is effected by the extender in both pretreated and non pretreated soil. This invention further relates to a method of extending the soil life of a thiolcarbanate herbicide comprising applying to the soil containing said thiolcarbanate herbicide or to which said thiolcarbanate herbicide is to be applied an extending amount of a certain thiolcarbamate, dithiocarbamate or carbanate extender compound sufficient to extend the soil life of said thiolcarbanate herbicide. This invention further relates to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation comprising applying to the locus where control is desired both an herbicidally effective amount of a thiolcarbamate herbicide and an extending amount of a thiolcarbanate, thiolcarbamate sulfone, th iolcarbanate sulfoxide, thionocarbamate, dithiocarbamate or carbanate extender compound sufficient to extend the soil life of said thiolcarbamate herbicide.

The objects of the present invention are achieved by applying the thiolcarbamate, thiolcarbamate sulfone, thiolcarbamate sulfoxyde, thionocarbamate, dithiocarbamate and carbamate extender canpound to the soil at an agricultural field site in conjunction with the thiolcarbamate herbicide. The two compounds can be applied simultaneously in a single mixture or in separate formulations, or they can be applied in succession, with either one following the other. In successive application, it is preferable to add the compounds as close in time as possible. The herbicide extending effect is operable over a wide range of weight ratios of the two compounds. It is most convenient, however, to apply the compounds at a weight ratio of about 0.2 1 to about 30 1 herbicide extender , preferably about 0.5 1 to about 20 1, and most preferably about 0.5 1 to about 12 1. Thiolcarbamate herbicides whose soil life is sought to be extended in the present invention include those disclosed in U.S. PatentNos. 2,913,327 3,582,314 3,330,821 and 3,330,643, and preferably include S ethyl N,N di n propylcarbamate S ethyl N,Nkiisobutyl thiolcarbamate S n propyl N,N di n propylthiolcarbamate S n propyl ethyl n butylthiolcarbamate S ethyl N ethyl N cyclohexylthiolcarbamate S ethyl hexahldro 1H azepine 1 carbothioatet S benzyl N,N di n propyl thiolcarbanate S 4 chlorobenzyl N,N diethyl thiolcarbamate S benzyl N ethyl N 1, 2 dimethylpropylthiolcarbamate S benzyl N, N di sec butyl thiolcarbamate S 2, 2,3 trichloroallyl N,N di isopropyl thiolcarbanate and S 2,3 dichloroallyl N,N diisopropyl thiolcarbamate. THIOLCARBAMATE HERBICIDE ANTIDOTES A wide range of chemical substances have been found to be effective as thiolcarbamate herbicide antidotes, and the preferred compositions of this invention may include any one or more of such antidotes. The variety of crops on which the present composition is useful can be significantly broadened by the use of an antidote to protect one crop from injury and render the composition more selective against weeds. Some of the ffore in,portant types of antidotes are anides of haloalkanoic acids, aromatic Oxime derivatives, thiasole carboxylic acids and derivatives, and 1,8 naphthalic anhydride. Asides of haloalkanoic acids have the generalized formulaEMI22.1 in which R is a mono or poly haloalkyl group. The halogens may be variously chloro, bromo or iodo chloro is the preferred halogen, and the preferred group for R in these compounds in general is dichloranethyl, Cl2CH , i.e., the compounds are amides of dichloroacetic acid. In such campounds the nitroqen is further substituted by at least one other functional group. This class of compounds also includes those in which the nitrogen forms a portion of a heterocyclic ring with substituents, as will be described below. Antidotes of this type are described in a number of publications such as U.S. Patents 4,021,224 4,256,481 and 4,294,764, and BritishPatent 1,521,540. U.S. Patent 4,021,224 contains a broad disclosure of such types of compounds and indicates a great many possibilities for monov or di substitution on the nitrogen atan. One type of antidote disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,021,224 is N,Ndiallyl dichioroacetamide, EMI22.2 which is included as an antidote in several ccamercial products containing thiolcarbanate herbicides. Another class of haloalkanoic acid amides is that in which the nitrogen atan is contained in an oxazolidine ring. Preferably R is dichloranethyl, and these oxazolidines have the general formulaEMI22.3 In this formula, Rut0, Rlt, R12, R13, R14 and R15 are variously independently hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl, or R10 and R11 taken together form an alkylene group, preferably a butylene, pentylene or hexylene group optionally substituted by one or two methyl groups. Compounds of these types are disclosed in a number of patents including U.S.Patents 4,021,224 and 4,256,481. Pepresentative compounds of this type include where not specifically mentioned the radical is hydrogen 2,2 dimethyl N dichloroacetyl oxalidine R10 and R11 methyl 2,2,5 trimethyl N dichloroacetyl oxazolidine R10, R11 and R14 methyl 2,2 dimethyl 5 n propyl N dichloroacetyl oxazolidine R10, R11 methyl, R14 n propyl 2,2 dimethyl 5 phenyl N dichloroacetyl oxalidine R10, R11 methyl, R14 phenyl 2,2 spirocyclohexyl N dichloroacetyl oxalidine R10 plus R11 taken together pentanethylene . Other compounds in which R10 and R11 taken together are alkylene are disclosed for instance in British Patents 1,512,540 and 2,023,582 andHungarian Patent 181,621. A third type of haloalkanoic acid anide is disclosed generally in U.S. Patent 4,294,764 and has the general formulaEMI23.1 in which R16 may be one of a nunber of alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl moieties R17, R18, R19 and R20 are independently hydrogen or methyl and n is 0 or 1. A representative canpound of this type is the compound N 1,3 dioxo lan 2 yl methyl N 2 phenyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide, which has the formulaEMI23.2 This corresponds to the previous formula in which R16 is 2 propenyl, R17 and R18 are both hydrogen and n is 0. Oxime derivatives which are suitable for use as antidotes with thiolcarbanate herbicides are disclosed, for instance in U.S. Patents 4,070,389 and 4,269,775 and have the general formula EMI24.1 in which R21 is cyano or a nunber of other moieties as indicated in U.S.Patent 4,269,775. lepresentative compounds of this type are those in which R21 is cyano and in which R21 is 1,3 dioxolan 2yl. The latter canpound has the chemical nane 0 2 1,3 dioxolanyl methyl alphacyanobenz aldoxime. Thiazole carboxylic acids and derivatives suitable for use as thiolcarbanate antidotes are disclosed generally in U.S. Patent 4,199,506 and have the general formulaEMI24.2 in which R22 is alkyl, haloalkyl or trialkoxymethyl R23 is variously hydrogen, agriculturally acceptable cations or various hydrocarbamyl or substituted hydrocarbamyl moieties and R24 is chloro, brano, iodo, lower alkoxy or substituted or unsubstituted phenoxy. A representative member of this class is the canpound benzyl 2doro 4 trifluoranethyl 5 thiazole carboxylate R22 trifluoranethyl R23 benzyl, R24 chloro m 1 . Another useful thiolcarbanate herbicide antidote compound is disclosed in European Patent No. 0104495 as having the formula whereinEMI24.3 R25 represents the groupEMI25.1 in which R28 represents a C1 3 haloalkyl containing from 1 to 3 halogen atans or a phenyl group optionally substituted R26 represents a hydrogen aran, a methyl or a phenyl R27 represents a C1 C8 alkyl group, a C56 cycloalkyl group, a cyclohexylmethyl group, a phenyl group optionally substituted, a benzyl group optionally substituted, an allyl or propargyl group and n is zero or one. A representative antidote of that group would be EMI25.2 The e amount of a given antidote to be utilized in combination with the thiolcarbamate herbicide extender composition of this invention and the manner of its utilization will vary according to the particular antidote to be employed, the crop which is to be protected, the amount or rate of herbicide to be applied, and the soil and climatic conditions of the agricultural enviroment in which the mixture is to be applied.The selection of a specific antidote for use in the thiolcarbamate herbicide extender composition, the manner in which it is to be applied e.g., tank mix, in turrow application, seed treatment, etc. , the determination of activity which is nonphyotoxic but antidotally effective, and the amount necessary to provide this result, can be readily performed utilizing the test procedures in the cited patents such as U.S. Patent 4,021,224 in accordance with common practice in the art. EDr other descriptions of antidotes and methods of their use, reference is made to U.S. Patent 3,959,304, issued to Teach on May 25, 1976 U.S. Patent 3,989,503, issued to Pallos et al. on Nbv. 2, 1976 U.S. Patent 3,131,509, issued to HDffman on May 5, 1964 U.S. Patent 3,564,768, issued to Hoffinan on Feb. 3, 1971 U.S. Patent 4,137,070, issued to Pallos et al. on Jan. 30, 1979 U.S. Patent 4,294,764, issued to Rinehart on Oct. 13, 1981 U.S. Patent 4,256,481, issued to Gardi et al. on May 17, 1981 U.S. Patent 4,415,353, issued to Pallos et al. on Nov. 15, 1983 and U.S. Patent 4,415,352, issued to Pallos et al. onNov. 15, 1983. A still further useful antidote is 1, 8 naphthal ic anhydride. The antidote is applied in conjunction with the thiolcarbamate herbicide and the thiolcarbamate, thiolcarbanate sulfone, thiolcarbanate sulfoxide, thionocarbamate, dithiocarbamate or carbonate extender in a non phytotoxic antidotally effective amount. By non phytotoxic is meant an amount of the antidote which causes at most minor injury to the desired crop species. By antidotally effective is meant an amount of the antidote which substantially decreases the extent of injury caused by the thiolcarbanate herbicide to the desired crop species. The preferred weight ratio of herbicide to antidote is fran about 0.1 1 to about 40 1.Another preferred weight ratio range is fran about 3 1 to about 25 1. An even more preferred weight ratio range is fran about 5 1 to about 20 1. The following examples are offered to illustrate the ccmpositions, methods, and effectiveness of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. EXAMPLE 4 EXrEND3R ACTIVITY EXAMPLES Herbicidal Activity nnprovement Tests Table 1 below offers herbicidal activity test data for representative extender canpounds within the scope of this invention showing their effectiveness in prolonging the herbicidal activity of thiolcarbamate herbicides. The effect is observed by comparing the extent of weed control in test flats treated with a thiolcarbamate herbicide against that occurring in similar flats treated with both the thiolcarbamate herbicide and an extender canpound of this invention.The soil used in such tests was a sandy loan soil fran Sunol, California, which was pre treated with the thiolcarbamate herbicide to simulate a typical field which had received previous herbicide applications. In most instances, the tests were run with a thiolcarbamate and antidote formulation see procedure 2 below , except for those test results marked with a single asterisk indicating that the soil was pre treated and then treated with a thiolcarbanate herbicide alone. SeeProcedure lA and 1B below . The effectiveness of the extender in minimizing the degradation of the thiolcarbanate herbicide in the soil is then verified by comparing the herbicidal activity of the herbicide or herbicide and antidote when applied alone to the herbicidal activity when those formulations are applied with the extender at varying rates. The herbicide alone or the herbicide and antidote without extended showed negligible herbicidal activity in conditioned soil, that is between 0 5 in conditioned soil.The extender compounds in each instance greatly increased the herbicidal activity in conditioned soil. The last column of Table 1 indicates the nonexistent or negligible herbicidal activity of each extender in non treated soil at 4 lb acre. In most instances, the extender was pre plant incorporated, except where PRE is noted after the test result, indicating that the extender was pre emergent surface applied at 4 lb acre. See Procedure 3A and 3B below. The procedures below detail the methods used to achieve the results tabulated in Table 1.1 Tests with S ethyl N,N di n propyl Thiolcarbamate and No AntidoteA. Soil Pre Treatment A solution was prepared by diluting an emulsifiable liquid con centrate containing 6 legal 0.72 k l 76.8 by weight of the herbicide S ethyl N,Ni n propylthiolcarbamate in 200 ml of water, such that the resulting concentration of herbicide in the solution was 2000 mg l. TWO hundred ml of this solution was then added to 200 ib 90.8 kg of soil to which 17 17 17 fertilizer N 3 zO5S2O on a weight basis had been pre viously added to a concentration of 50 ppn by weight with respect to the soil. The mixture was mixed in.a rotary mixer for 10 to 30 minutes. The soil was then placed in round plastic containers, 7.5 inches 19.0 an in diameter by 7.5 inches 19.0 cm deep. The herbicidal rate applied was equivalent to 3 lb acre. The soil was tamped and leveled with a row marker to impress one row across the width of each container. This row was seeded with watergrass Echinochloa crus galli . Sufficient seeds were planted to produce several seedlings. The containers were then placed in a greenhouse maintained at 20 0C to 30 0C and watered daily by sprinlder. About six weeks after treatment, the soil was allowed to dry out and the plant foliage was removed. The soil was then passed through a 0.25 inch 0.64 an screen to remove plant roots and clods.B. Herbicide Test A solution was prepared by diluting an emulsifiable liquid concentrate containing 6 legal 0.72 Jowl 76.8 by weight of the herbicide S ethyl N,N di n propylthiolcarbamate in 675 ml of water such that the resulting concexltration of herbicide in the solution was 1.14 mg ml.Five ml of this solution when added to three pounds of soil yielded a quantity in the soil equivalent to three pounds of herbicide per acre. The extender canpounds were used in technical form. Ench representative extender was dissolved in 5 ml acetone and 14.5 ml water such that the resulting concentration of the extender in the solution was 1.54 mg ml. Five ml of this solution when added to three pounds of soil yielded a quantity in the soil equivalent to four pounds of extender per acre. Five ml of the extender solution and 5 ml of the herbicide solution were tank mixed. The resultant mixture of 10 ml was then added to 3Ibs of soil and incorporated into the soil by a rotary mixer. Thus, 10 ml of the mixture and 3 pounds of soil were placed in rotary mixter and incorporated, yielding a quantity of herbicide and extender in the soil of 3 and 4 lb A, respectively. Sone of the extenders, as noted in the table, were tested at varying rates. In those cases, the appropriate ml of the extender solution were tank mixed with 5 ml of the herbicide stock solution to yield the desired application rates of 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 lb acre. The treated soil was then placed in aluminum flats which were appromaxitely 3.5 inches deep, 7.5 inches wide, and 2.5 inches long 8.9 x 19.5 x 6.4 an . The soil was tanped and leveled with a row marker to impress six rows across the width of the flat. The test weeds were as follows COMMON NAME ABBREVIATION SCIENTIFIC ME watergrass WG Echinochloa crus galli L. wild oats WO Avena fatua L. sharttercane SHC Sorghum bicolor L. Moench R 10 milo Sorghum bicolor was also used as a plant growth indicator. TWO raws of watergrass were planted. One row of DeKalb XL 25A corn of species Zea mays L. was also planted. Sufficient seeds were planted to produce approximately 20 25 seedlings per row. The flats were then placed in a greenhouse maintained at 70 to 85 F 21 to 300C and watered daily by sprinkler. Approximately three weeks after treatment, the degree of weed control was estimated and recorded as a percentage compared to the growth of the same species in a check flat of the sane age which had been seeded in corditioned soil but not treated with either an herbicide or an extenderThe rating scale ranges from 0 to 100 , where 0 equals no effect with plant growth equal to the untreated check, ard 100 equals canplete kill.2 Tests with S ethyl N,N di n propyl thiolcarbanate and the Antidote N,N diallyl Dichioroacetamide These procedures are essentially the same as that of 1A and 1B except that the antidote N,N diallyl dichloroacetamide was applied with the herbicide. The stock solutions described in 1 B were formulated, and added tionally a stock solution containing a thiolcarbanate herbicide and an antidote was prepared as follows An emulsifiable liquid concentrate of S ethyl N,N di propyl thiolcarbamate 82.8 and of N,N diallyl dichloroacetamide 6.9 was diluted in water such that the resulting concentration of thiolcarbamate herbicide in the solution was 1.14 mg ml. The weight ratio of the thiolcarbamate herbicide to antidote was 12 1. An appropriate amount of the stock solution of each representative extender was applied to yield the desired application rate. The rest of the procedure of 1 B including the evaluation criteria was followed. Table 1 indicates where unasterisked the test results wherein the thiolcarbamate herbicide and antidote were applied at 3 and 0.25 lb acre, respectively, by pre plant incorporation, and the exterder was applied at 4.0, 2.0, 1.0 or 0.5 lb acre by pre plant incorporation as described above in 1.3 ESerbicidal Screening tests for Extender Alone The last colunn of Table 1 as noted above Shows herbicidal screening data for the representative exterder compounds when tested alone at 4 lb acre. In most cases, the extenders were pre plant incorporated except wherein an asterisk indicates that they were pre emergent surface applied. 3A Pre Plant Incorporation Best The soil used in these tests was sandy loam soil fran Sunol,California to which 17 17 17 fertilizer N P2O5 K2 on a weight basis had been added to a concentration of 50 ppn by weight with respect to the soil. The extender compounds were used in technical form. These materials were added to 5 ml acetone and 14.5 ml water such that the resulting concentration of the extender in the solution was 1.54 nq ml. Five or ten ml of this solution was added to three pounds of soil in a rotary mixer, and mixed thoroughly, yielding a quantity of extender in the soil equivalent to 4 lb acre. The treated soil was then placed in aluninun flats which were apprcsimately 2.5 inchs deep, 3.5 inches wide, and 7.5 inches long 6.4 an x 8.9 an x 19.0 cm . The soil was tamped and leveled with a row marker to impress six rows across the width of the flat. The test weeds were as follows COMMON NAME ABBREVIATION SCIENTIFIC NAME watergrass XS Echinochloa crus galli wild oats WO Avena fauta shattercane SH Sorghun bicolor Further, R 10 milo Sorghum bicolor was also planted as a plant growth indicator, and X 10 corn Zea maize was planted as a crop sensitivity indicator. Two rows of watergrass were planted.One row of each of the other weeds, plant growth indicator and crop were planted. Sufficient seeds were planted to produce several seedlings per inch in each row. The flats were then placed in a greenhouse maintaineed at 70 to 85 F 21 to 30 C and watered daily by sprinkler. Two weeks after treatment, the degree of injury or control is determined by ccmparison with untreated check plants of the sane age. The injury rating from 0 to 100 is recorded for each species as percent control with 0 representing no injury and 100 representing canplete kill.3 B Pre emergence herbicide test. On the day preceding treatment, seeds of eight different weed species are planted in loamy sand soil in individual rows using one species per row across the width of a flat. The seeds used are green foxtail FT Setaria viridis , watergrass was Echinochloa crus galli , wild oat WO Avena fatua , annual morningglory AS Ipanoea lacunssa , velvetleaf VL Abutilon theoptirasti , Indian mustard MD Brassica juncea , redroot pigweed PW Amaranthus retroflexus or curly dock CDj Runex crispus , and yellow nutsedge YNG Cyperus esculentus . Ample seeds are planted to give about 20 to 40 seedlings per row, after emergence, depending upon the size of the plants. Using an analytical balance, 600 milligrams mg of the extender compound to be tested were weighed out on a piece of glassine weighing paper. The paper and compound are placed in a 60 ml wide mouth clear bottle and dissolved in 45 ml of acetone or substituted solvent. Eighteen ml of this solution are transferred to a 60 ml wide mouth clear bottle and diluted with 22 ml of a water and acetone mixture 19 1 containing enough polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate emulsifier to give a final solution of 0.5 v v . The solution is then sprayed on a seeded flat on a linear spray table calibrated to deliver 80 gallons per acre 748 L ha .The application rate is 4 Ib acre 4.48 Kghha . After treatment, the flats are placed in the greenhouse at a temperature of 70 to 80 F and watered by sprinkling. qo weeks after treatment, the degree of injury or control is determined by ccmparison with untreated check plants of the same age. The injury rating fran 0 to 100 is recorded for each species as percent control with 0 representing no injury and 100 representing complete control. The results tabulated in Table 1 indicate that each of the extender compounds significantly increased the herbicidal activity of the herbicide alone or herbicide and antidote formulations in corditioned soil. Ihese results were unexpected in that as shown in the last colunn, none of the extenders had any significant herbicidal activity of their own.

As inExample 4 above, the effect is observed by canparing weed control at a set period after application in test flats treated with an antidoted thiolcarbamate herbicidal composition against that in similar flats treated with such a herbicidal composition also containing the representative extender compound. The thiolcarbanate herbicides employed in this exanple were as follows S ethyl N,N di propyl thiolcarbamate EPTAMe S ethyl N,N di isobutyl thiolcarbanate SUTANRS n propyl N,N di n propyl thiolcarbanate VERONA The antidote employed was N,N diallyl dichloroacetamide in a weight ratio with EPTAM of 12 1 herbicidWantidote 24 1 with SUTAN0 and 12 1 with VERN. The representative extender canpound employed in this example was ethyl N,N di 3 chloroallyl thiolcarbanate, Compound No. 1 in the Table of Compounds, supra.A. Soil Pre Treatment 1st Treatment Aluninun flats 3 inches deep, 6 inches wide and 8 inches long 7.6 x 15.24 x 20.32 cm were filled with sandy loam soil fran Sunol,California. Ten ml of an aqueous stock solution containing 11.1 mg ofEPTAMR and 0.925 mg of the antidote was mixed into each of two flats of soil using a 5 gallon cement mixer. The stock solution was prepared by suspending 134.1 mg of an emulsifiable concentrate containing 6.7 lb ofEPTAMR and 0.56 lb of N,N diallyl dichloroacetamide per gallon in 100 ml of water. The application rate was 3 lb A of EPTAMR and 0.25 lb A of the antidote. Two other flats of soil were pre treated with 10 ml of solution containing 11.1 mg of VERNAMR and 0.925 mg of the antidote. The stock solution was prepared by suspending 132.1 mg of an emulsifiable concentrate containing 6.7 lb of VEb and 0.56 lb of the antidote per gallon in 100 ml of water. The application rate was 3 lb A of UERa and 0.25 lb A of the antidote. Two additional flats of soil were pre treated with 10 ml of a solution containing 14.8 mg of SUmNe and 0.615 mg of the antidote. This stock solution was prepared by suspending 173.7 mg of an emulsifiable concentrate containing 6.7 lb of SUSAN and 0.28 lb of the antidote per gallon in 100 ml of water. The application rate was 4 lb A of SUTANR and 0.17 lb A of the antidote. The flats of soil treated with the thiolcarbanate herbicides listed above in combination with the antidote were placed in the greenhouse at 70 90 F for six weeks where they were kept moist by watering lightly by sprinkling. No seeds were planted in the flats for the pretreatment.B. Herbicide Treatment 2nd Treatment Six weeks after the first treatment shown in part A , one flat of soil of each pair of flats that were pre treated with the sane herbicidal canpositions was retreated with the same herbicide plus antidote composition by mixing 10 ml of stock solution prepared the sane way as described in part A, with a flat full of soil in a 5 gallon cement mixer PPI application . The other flat of each pair was treated with a tank mix containing 10 ml of the herbicide plus antidote stock solution, prepared as described in part A , in ccmbination with 10 ml of a stock solution containing 3.7 mg of the extender, ethyl N,N bis 3 chloroallyl thiolcarbamate. The extender stock solution was prepared by dissolving 37 mg of the technical ethyl N,N bis 3 chloroallyl thiolcarbanate in 5 ml of acetone containing 2 drops of a blend of polyoxyethylene ethers of sorbitan mono laurate followed by adding 95 ml of water. The 20 ml of tank mix containing the 3 way canbination of herbicide antidote extender was pre plant incorporated into the soil with a gallon cement mixer as above. The soil was then placed back in the aluminum flat. In each flat of soil, one row of approximately 50 seeds of watergrass Echinochloa crus galli was planted 0.5 inch deep immediately 0 days delay . The flats of soil were watered lightly and placed in the greenhouse at 70 900F. A second row of watergrass was planted in each flat 2 days after the second treatment and other rows were planted 5, 8, 12 and 21 days after the second treatment, respectively. Weed control results for rows seeded at the same time were recorded four weeks after the seeding. Thus, the ratings were made fran 28 49 days after the second treatment. Table 2 records those results, which indicate that the herbicidal activity of all three thiolcarbamate herbicides was prolonged dramatically when the extender was included in the herbicidal composition. The extender tested at 1 and 4 lb A respectively in non pretreated soil showed no herbicidal activity on watergrass.

The procedures of Examples 5 B were followed except that the seedings occurred 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively, after the first and only treatment of the soil. Table 3 indicates again that the extender prolongs the soil life of all three thiolcarbamate herbicides in composition with an antidote.As indicated above, the extender Compound No. 1 showed no herbicidal activity against watergrass when tested at 1 and 4 lb A, respectively in non pretreated soil.

METHODS OF APPLICATION The herbicidal coooositions of the present invention are useful in controlling the growth of undesirable vegetation by pre emergence or post emergence application to the locus where control is desired, including pre plant and post plant soil incorporation as well as surface application. The compositions are generally embodied in formulations suitable for convenient application. Typical formulations contain additional ingredients or diluent carriers which are either inert or active. Exam ples of such ingredients or carriers are water, organic solvents, dust carriers, granular carriers, surface active agents, oil and water, wateroil emulsions, wetting agents, dispersing agents, and emulsifying agents. The herbicidal formulations generally take the form of dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, granules and pellets, or microcapsules.A. DUSTS Dusts are dense powder canpositions which are intended for application in dry form. Dusts are characterized by their free flowing and rapid settling properties so that they are not readily windborne to areas where their presence is not desired. They contain primarily an active material and a dense, free flowing, solid carrier. Their performance is sometimes aided by the inclusion of a wetting agent, and convenience in manufacture frequently demands the inclusion of an inert, absorptive grinding aid. Err the dust composi tions of this invention, the inert carrier may be either of vegetable or mineral origin, the wetting agent is preferably anionic or nonionic, and suitable absorptive grinding aids are of mineral origin. Suitable classes of inert solid carriers for use in the dust compositions are those organic or inorganic powders which possess high bulk density and are very free flowing. They are also characterized by low surface area and poor liquid absorptivity. Suitable grinding aids are natural clays, diat aceous earths, and synthetic mineral fillers derived from silica or silicate. Among ionic and nonionic wetting agents, the most suitable are the members of the group known to the art as wetting agents and emulsifiers. Although solid agents are preferred because of ease of incorporation, some liquid nonionic agents are also suitable in the dust formulations. Preferred dust carriers are micaceous talcs, pyrophyllite, dense kaolin clays, tobacco dust and ground calcium phosphate rock.Preferred grinding aids are attapulgite clay, diatomaceous silica, synthetic fine silica and synthetic calcium and magnesium silicates. Most preferred wetting agents are alkylbenzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodiun isothionate, esters of sodiun sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, and ditertiary acetylenic glycols. Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkylnaphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthaler.esulfonateF poly methylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate, and scdium methyli long chain acid taurates. The inert solid carriers in the dusts of this invention are usually present in concentrations of fran about 30 to 90 weight percent of the total canposition. The grinding aid will usually constitute 5 to 50 weight percent of the compositions, and the wetting agent will constitute from about 0 to 1.0 weight percent of the composition. Dust compositions can also contain other surfactants such as dispersing agents in concentrations of up to about 0.5 weight percent, and minor anounts of anticaking and antistatic agents. The particle size of the carrier is usually in the range of 30 to 50 microns.B. EMULSIFIBLE CONCEI Emulsifiable concentrates are usually solutions of the active materials in nonwater miscible solvents together with an emulsifying agent. Prior to use, the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of solvent droplets. typical solvents for use in emulsifiable concentrates include weed oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and nonwater miscible ethers, esters, and ketones. typical emulsifying agents are anionic or nonionic surfactants, or mixtures of the two. Examples include long chain alkyl or mercaptan polyethoxy alcohols, alkylaryl polyethoxy alcohols, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene ethers with sorbitan fatty acid esters , polyoxyethylene glycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol amide condensates, calciun and amine salts of fatty alcohol sulfates, oil soluble petroleun sulfonates, or preferably mixtures of these emulsifying agents. Such emulsifying agents will comprise from about I to 10 weight percent of the total composition. Thus, emulsifiable concentrates of the present invention will consist of from about 15 to about 50 weight percent active material, about 40 to 82 weight percent solvent, and about 1 to 10 weight percent emulsifier. Other additives such as spreading agents and stickers can also be included.C. ANULFS AND PELLETS Granules and pellets are physically stable, particulate compositions containing the active ingredients adhering to or distributed through a basic matrix of a coherent, inert carrier with macroscopic dimensions. A typical particle is about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. Surfactants are often present to aid in leaching of the active ingredient fran the granule or pellet. The carrier is of mineral or organic origin, and generally falls within one of two types. The first are porous, absorptive, preformed granules, such as preformed and screened granular attapulgite or heat expanded, granular, screened vermiculite. On either of these, a solution of the active agent can be sprayed and will be absorbed at concentrations up to 25 weight percent of the total weight. The second, which are also suitable for pellets, are initially powdered kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite, or bentonite clays in the form of sodiun, calciun, or magnesium bentonites.Water soluble salts, such as sodiun salts, may also be present to aid in the disintegration of granules or pellets in the presence of moisture. Ihese ingredients are blended with the active components to give mixtures that are granulated or pelleted, followed by drying, to yield formulations with the active component distributed uniformly throughout the mass. Such granules and pellets can also be made with 25 to 30 weight percent active component, but more frequently a concentration of about 10 weight percent is desired for optimun distribution. The granular compositions of this invention are most useful in a size range of 15 30 mesh. The surfactant is generally a common wetting agent of anionic or non ionic character. The most suitable wetting agents depend upon the type of granule used. When preformed granules are sprayed with active material in liquid form the most suitable wetting agents are nonionic, liquid wetters miscible with the solvent. These are compounds most generally known in the art as emulsifiers, and comprise alkylaryl polyether alcohols, alkyl polyether alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol anide condensates, oil solution petroleun or vegetable oil sulfonates, or mixtures of these.Such agents will usually comprise up to about 5 weight percent of the total composition. When the active ingredient is first mixed with a powdered carrier and subsequently granulated, or pelleted, liquid nonionic wetters can still be used, but it is usually preferable to incorporate at the mixing stage one of the solid, powered anionic wetting agents such as those previously listed for the table powders. Such agents will can prise fran about 0 to 2 weight percent of the total canposition. Thus, the preferred granular or pelleted formulations of this invention canprise about 5 to 30 percent by weight active material, about 0 to 5 weight percent wetting agent, and about 65 to 95 weight percent inert material carrier, as these terms are used herein.D. MICROCAPSULES Microcapsules consist of fully enclosed droplets or granules containing the active materials, in which the enclosing material is an inert porous membrane, arranged to allow escape of the enclosed materials to the surrounding medium at controlled rates aver a specified period.Encapsulated droplets are typically about 1 to 50 microns in diameter. The enclosed liquid typically constitutes about 50 to 95 of the weight of the entire capsule, and may contain a small amount of solvent in addition to the active materials. Encapsulated granules are characterized by porous membranes sealing the openings of the granule carrier pores, trapping the liquid containing the active canponents inside for controlled release. A typical granule size ranges fran 1 millimeter to 1 centimeter in diameter. In agricultural usage, the granule size is generally about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. Granules formed by extrusion, agglomeration, or trilling are useful in the present invention as well as materials in their naturally occurring form. Exanples of such carriers are vermiculite, sintered clay granules, kaolin, attapulgite clay, sawdust, and granular carbon. Useful encapsulating materials include natural and synthetic rubbers, cellulosic materials, styrene butadiene copolymers, polyacrylonitriles, polyacrylates, polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, and starch xanthates. E. INJECTION WITH AnYDROUS AMMONIA The herbicidal compositions of the instant invention comprising a thiolcarbamate herbicide, and thiolcarbamate, thionocarbamate, thiolcarbamate sulfone, thiolcarbamate sulfoxide, dithiocarbamate or carbamate extender and optionally an antidote can be applied to the soil by in line injection with anhydrous ammonia. For pre emergence soil injection applications of anhydrous ammonia, on conservation or conventional tilled acreage, the herbicidal composition of the instant invention can be introduced into the anhydrous line using a metering pump which offers a constant rate of the output Fer acre independent of the anhydrous ammonia output rate.The herbicidal composition discharge hose can tee into the amnonia discharge line between the meter and the manifold. Injection depth can be from 4 to 5 inches. The herbicidal compositions can also be injected with anhydrous ammonia in still situations. Other herbicide products can be surface applied and incorporated at the sane time the herbicidal compositions of the instant invention and anhydrous ammonia are injected, or post emergent applications can be used.F. IN CENEL Each of the above formulations can be prepared as a package containing both the herbicide and the extender together with the other irgre dients of the formulation diluents, emulsifiers, surfactants, etc. . The formulations can also be prepared by a tank mix method, in which the ingredients are obtained separately and combined at the grower site. The herbicide and extender may both be used in the sane type of formulation or a different formulation may be used for each, e.g. the herbicide may be in microcapsule form while the extender tray be an emulsifiable concentrate, or vice versa. As a further alternative, the herbicide and extender can be applied sequentially, with either being applied first. This is a less preferred method, however, since more effective results are obtained with simultaneous application. In general, any conventional method of application can be used.The locus of application can be soil, seeds, seedlings, or the actual plants, as well as flooded fields. Soil application is preferred. Dusts and liquid compositions can be applied by the use of powder dusters, boan and hand sprayers, and spray dusters. The canpositions can also be applied from airplanes as dusts and sprays because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control the growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical exanxple, the dust and liquid compositions are applied to the soil according to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least one half inch below the soil surface.It is not necessary that the phytotaxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles. Instead, these composi tions can be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil. The phytotoxic canpositions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. tis method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. Dust compositions, gran ul ar compositions or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discing, dragging or mixing operations. The herbicidextender compositions can also be applied to the soil through irrigation systems. According to this technique, the compo sitions are added directly to irrigation water immediately prior to irrigation of the field. This technique is applicable in all geographical areas regardless of rainfall, since it permits supplementation of the natural rainfall at critical stages of plant growth. In a typical application, the concentration of the herbicide exterder composition in the irrigation water will range fran about 10 to 150 parts per million by weight. The irrigation water can be applied by the use of sprinkler systems, surface furrows, or flooding.Such application is most effectively done before the weeds germinate, either early in the spring prior to germination or within tWD days after cultivation of the field. The amount of the present composition which constitutes a herbicidally effective amount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled. The rate of application of active ingredient varies from about 0.01 to about 50 pounds per acre, preferably about 0.1 to about 25 pounds per acre with the actual amount depending on the overall cost and the desired results. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that compositions exhibiting lower herbicidal activity will require a higher dosage than more active canpounis for the sane degree of control.
