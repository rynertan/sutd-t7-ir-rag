# Panel, in particular for self supporting roof structures and self supporting roof structures assembled of such panels.

## Abstract
Hollow panel of extruded plastics for walls and roof structures and having at least two main ducts 1a, 1b 2a, 2b 3a, 3b separated by a secondary duct which may be divided into three or more subducts 23, 24, 25, 26 , one of which 26 may be dimensioned so as to accommodate an anchor bar 29 intended for absorbing upwardly directed wind pressure. Each of the main ducts is divided into two channels by a thinner intermediate wall 4, 5, 6 which may extend through the secondary duct or ducts to give them greater stability while at the same time ensuring a good insulation. A plurality of panels can be assembled into, e.g., a self supporting arcuate roof surface, the panels being pro vided with coupling members 19, 20, 21, 22 forming together locking ducts wherein locking wedges or reinforc ing bands 38 of metal are inserted. The subducts of the panels are so designed as to be able to resist pressure and torsional forces without using reinforc ing elements in the ducts.
