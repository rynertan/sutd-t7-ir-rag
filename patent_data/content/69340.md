## Description
is invention is directed to a curable mold ing composition containing a a poly acrylate , b acrylic or methacrylic acid or functionalized derivatives thereof which are different from aj, and c an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which is soluble in and copolymerizable with a and b and which is different from a and b . The combination of components in the composition of this invention have been found to produce reinforced articles having a particularly good balance of mechanical properties.Molded reinforced articles may be produced from the composition of this invention by a very rapid mold cycle which is typically less than about 2 minutes from the time the cure of the resin is initiated. French Patent No. 1,567,710 describes the manufacture of the diacrylate of dipropoxylated bisphenol F which is thereafter diluted with styrene in a ratio of about 30 parts by weight of styrene to about 70 parts by weight of the bis acrylate . This material is reacted, in the presence of benzoyl peroxide to effect a cured product in about 14 minutes and 30 seconds.The same resin is also catalyzed with 1 percent benzoyl peroxide as a 30 percent solution in tri cresylphosphste and 0.15 percent diethylaniline. The resulting resin is used to make a fiberglass reinforced plastic laminate containing 12 layers of fiber resulting in a laminated sheet about 3 msllimeters thick. The sheet sets in about 1 hour and then is heated at 115iC for 24 hours. Methyl methacrylate was also used to produce the bis methacrylate product which was also combined with styrene and evaluated for its SPI gel test time.Further experiments were carried out in the patent making the dimethacrylate of ethylene glycol which was polymerized with benzoyl peroxide. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 129,883, filed March 27, 1980 in the name of E. N. Peters and titled A PolyCAcrylate Containing Composition AndProcess For Producing Molded Articles , describes compositions containing a particular poly acrylate , an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which is soluble in and copolymerizable with the polycacrylate , and an elevated temperature free radical curing catalyst capable of effecting the co reaction of the poly acrylate and ethylenically unsaturated monomer.
