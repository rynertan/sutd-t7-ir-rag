# Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes.

## Abstract
Stabilizer with a collar consisting of half parts 1,3 self binding by insertion of the connecting ends of projecting lengths 4 of the mobile half part 3 in corresponding binding seats 6 of the half part 1 fitted on the wall, the tightness being determined by the gripping effect made by this part 3 on the interposed one 1 . The gradual tie is possible through parallel vertical toothings 5,7 correspond ingly fitted to the two adherence wall couples of the binding components, 4,6 which act with retention on disconnection. By changing the introduction length of said parts 4 into the tie seats 6 the collar width can be changed. The stabilizer can be made in several ways by using plastic and other materials having elasticity.

## Claims
CLAIMS I Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes,characterized by the fact that the collar is foreseen in plastic materials or howe ver in materials having elasticity and foresees self binding pa rts, in plastic or elastic materials, by clutching on the connection ends of projecting lenghts of the mobile half part, in corresponding tie seats of the half part fitted on the wall, the tightness condition being performed by the gripping effect of this part on the other interposed one. The collar tie that can be graduated is allowed by identure parallel, vertical sys tems foreseen in correspondance on the two adherence wall couples which are acting as retention on disconnecting by changing the introduction Ienght of this parts into the tie seats, they allow to change the collar width. The condition of integr ally operating collar is permitted on the tie components by the combined effects as follows by the outer gripping one, which the fixed part acts on the interposed one, and by expanding e ffect performed inside on the gutter pipe. 2 Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes, according to the pre vious claim, characterized by the fact that in a version, the square base collar employs half part 1 to be fixed on the wall by means of settler 2 and to be tied to the mobile half part 3 by axial insertion, one the two jonction ends, of the lenghts 4 with toothed walls 5 into the corresponding seats 6 with analo gous toothings 7. For assembling, the two indentations are int roduced into the corresponding seats and are approched by means of pincers on the two pairs of vanes 8 and 9. 3 Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes, according to the pre vious claims, characterized by the fact that for releasing, wi th a point the projecting parts of vanes 9 are raised. In order to reach an additional adjustment and particularly to avoid sec tion differences, still bringing the binding devices to a shift limit, fpur yielding lenghts 10 have been foreseen on the increasing of the expanding effect performed by the rain pipe beating on the two reinforcing bases 11, lenghts 10 deform the curve on the edges, thus increasing the collar containing capacity. 4 Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes, according to the pr evinus claims, characterized byt he fact that in a version, the circular base collar employs fixed half part 12 fitted on the wall by means of settler13 to be tied on half part 14 by axial insertion on the two connection ends of the toothed wall 16 pa rts 15 into the corresponding seat 17 with analogous indentatio ns 18.For assembling, the two toothed lenghts are introduced into the corresponding seats and are approached by means of pincers on the two pars of parts 19 and 20. For releasing, the gripping part is drawn off by means of a point on the projecting side of parts 19. 5 Stabilizer with collar for gutter pipes, according to the pr evious claims, characterized by the fact that the additional e xpanding effect of the collar with circular base is allowed by the two yielding part 21sand 22 through the increase of the pr ession acted bythe gutter pipe on the reinforcing base 23.

## Description
Stabilizer with collar for quitter pipes .The invention refers to a collar stabilizer for rain gutters consisting of self typing parts, one of which on the wall to be assembled to the other with gripping effect on corresponding bi nding parts that operate on adherence walls equipped with retention means. By changing the introduction of the tying parts, the width of the collar can be graduated allowing in this way the adjustment to the gutter pipe size. The pipe fittings are foreseen in glass form, i.e. by coaxial introduction or conical clutch the latter system causes some difficulties Owing to the different sizes when introducing. Diversities may also occur as to the tolerances foreseen or to working defects.The present stabilizers are foreseen with tie parts of correspo ndance and do not allow adjustments in the containment perimeter. The invention permits the solution of the problem by the u se of a collar with self binding parts, in plastic or elastic materials, by clutching on the connection ends of projecting lenghts of the mobile half part, in corresponding tie seats of the half part fitted on the wall, the tightness condition bei ng performed by the gripping effect of this part on the other interposed one The collar tie that can be graduated, is allowed by indenture parallel, vertical systems foreseen in correspondance on the two adherence wall couples which are acting as retention on disconnecting by changing the introduction length of this part into the tie seats, they allow to change the col lar width.The condition of integrally operating cellar is per mitted on the tie components by the combined effect8 as folio ws by the outer gripping one, which the fixed part acts on the other interposed one, and by the expanding effect performed in side ontthe gutter pipe.Execution versions are illustrated for information only by the drawings of Table 1, where Fig. 1 is the view from above a squa re stabilizer with inserted half parts. Fig. 2 is the perspective view of the same stabilizer showing the disconnected tying componeflts.Fig. 3 is a view of the stabilizer holding the rain pipe. Figures 4 and 5 represent the section of the tying device with the introduction part brought to the seat limit and in a limited shift respectively.In particular, the sidewise projecting vanes can be noted which allows to act ontthe tying components. Fig. 6 is the outer perspective view of the junction part tw show the gripping vanes which can be brought near by means of pincers. Fig. 7 shows the same part with the vanes brought to adherence and in disactivation phase by acting on the lever fitted in the lower projecti ng part with a conventional point. Fig. 8 is the view from above of the collar with a circular base. Figures 9 and 10 show the section of the tying device, with the introdu ction part brought to the seat limit and in a limited shift respectively. qIn a version, the square base collar employs half part 1 to be fixed on the wall by means of settler2 and to be tied to the mobile half part 3 by axial insertion, on the two jonction en ds, 6f the lenghts 4 with toothed walls 5 into the correspond ing seats 6 with analogoustoothings 7. For assembling, the two indentations are introduced into the corresponding seats and a re approched by means of pincers on the two pairs of vanes 8 a nd 9.For releasing, with a point the projecting parts of vanes 9 are raised.In order to reach an additional adjustment and p articularly to avoid section differences, still bringing the binding devices to a shift limit, four yielding lenghts 10 have been foreseen on the increasing of the expanding effect performed by the rain pipe beating on the two reinforcing bases Ii, lenghts 10 deformthe curve on the edges, thus increasing the collar containing capacity. In a version, the circular base collar employs fixed half part 12 fitted on the wall by means of settler 13 to be tiedvon half part 14 by axial insertion on the two connection ends 6f the toothed wall 16 parts 15 into the corresponding seat 17 wi th analogous indentations 18.For assembling, the two toothed lengths are introduced into the corresponding seats and are proached by means of pincers on the two pairs of parts 19 and 20. For releasing, the gripping part is drawn off by means of a point on the projecting side of parts 19. The additional ex panding effect of the collar with circular base is allowed by the two yielding parts 21 and 22 through the increase of the pression acted by the gutter pipe on the reinforcing base 23. The collar execution particulars, the retention systems, the settling of the tying devices, as well the employ materials may be different.
