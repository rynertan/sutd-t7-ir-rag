# Granular fabric softening composition.

## Abstract
A comelted granular fabric softening composition which is water dispersible in the cold water rinse of a washing machine, comprising about 60 to about 85 of a di long chain quaternary ammonium salt and about 15 to about 40 of a mono long chain quaternary ammonium salt hav ing from 10 to 14 carbon atoms in its single long chain. The fabric softening composition may also contain up to about 25 of optional ingredients. In one embodiment of the inven tion the fabric softening agent is adapted to be placed within a water permeable envelope. The envelope can be inserted into a washing machine during a laundering operation to provide fabric softening benefits to the clothes being laundered.
