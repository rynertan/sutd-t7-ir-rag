## Abstract
2,4 Dichlorobenzyl alcohol is obtained in high purity and in high yield by reacting 2,4 dichlorobenzyl chloride in a two stage reaction with a water soluble salt of an organic acid in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst to give the 2,4 di chlorbenzyl ester of the organic acid which is subsequently hydrolysed with a strong base.
