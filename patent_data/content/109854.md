# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICES AND METHODS FOR MAKING THE SAME

## Abstract
An array of MOS transistors 30 is formed in a semiconductor substrate having a plurality of continuous diffused lines bit lines 7 3,7 4,7 5 and 7 6 serving as the source and drain regions of a plurality of MOS transistors. A plurality of conductive word lines 33, 133 are formed over the plurality of diffused lines, crossing the diffused lines at substantially right angles, with each conductive word line serving as the gates of a plurality of MOS transistors. Each transistor of the memory array is formed in a region containing two continuous diffused lines and a single word line. A single electrical contact 36 3, 4, 5, 6 to a bit line is formed for each such diffused line.
