## Description
This invention relates to new antianaphylactic and anti bronchospastic piperazine derivatives, isomers mixture thereof, individual enantiomers and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In US patent No. 3,244,718, piperazine derivatives are described having a structure similar to that one of the present invention. Even though, however, it is stated that the phenyl ring attached via a carboxamidoethyl radical to piperazine may be variously substituted, in the preparative Examples only one case is reported wherein said ring is substituted by a trifluoromethyl group, but here the benzhydryl moiety is lacking whereas this moiety is always an integrant part of the compounds of the present invention. It was now surprisingly found that by duly modifying the substituents of the phenyl ring attached via carboxamido alkyl to piperazine, compounds are obtained showing a high antianaphylactic and antibronchospastic activity. Object of the present invention are there fore new piperazine derivatives of general formula The term lower alkyl and alkyl means here and thereafter a straight or branched alkyl chain containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, t butyl, sec butyl and the like. For pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts the addition salts are intended with organic or inorganic acids, such as for example hydrochloric, sulfuric, sulfamic, tartaric, hydrobromic acid, hydrogen iodide, glycolic, citric, malic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, ascorbic acid and the like. They have been prepared by simple adding one or more acid equivalents to the free base. Intermediates and end products of the present invention have been prepared by known procedures. In this way the starting compound employed in the following Examples, that is N benzhydrylpiperazine II , has been described in several patents and literature or it can be obtained according to known procedures described in literature see for example K.E. Hamlin et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., For preparing the compounds of this invention, the derivative II is reacted with an acryloylanilide derivative of formula Here the reagents are dissolved in equimolar amounts in a suitable solvent, for example dimethylformamide, toluene, xylene and the like, and heated for several hours at a temperature ranging from 50 to 100 C. When as solvent dimethylsulfoxide is employed, the reaction temperature can be greatly lowered, that is one can work also between 10 and 40 C. At the end of the reaction the desired intermediate thus obtained is collected, for example by filtration or evaporation of the solvent, and eventually purified by silica gel chromatography and or crystallization from a suitable solvent. When desired, the compound may be eventually transformed into its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The new compounds of the present invention are character ized by a high antianaphylactic and antibronchospastic activity and by a low toxicity. The LD₅₀ of the new piperazine derivatives has been determined in the mouse, both ip and per os, following the method described by C.S.
