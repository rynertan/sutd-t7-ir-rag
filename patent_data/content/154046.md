# Open roof construction for a vehicle.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an open roof construction for a vehicle, provided with a panel, which in the closed position closes an opening in the roof of the vehicle and which is movable from this closed position or to this closed position by means of at least one push pull cable. The push pull cable 2 is displaceable by means of a driving wheel, which is rotatable in two opposite directions. A locking member 1 at least substantially prevents a rotation of the driving wheel by the push pull cable 2, which locking member 1 comprises two cooperating locking parts 4, 5. The first one 4 of these locking parts is stationary and the second locking part 5, when at rest, is maintained in the locked position. This second locking part 5 can first be brought from its locked a position into its released position with respect to the stationary locking part 4 by means of an actuating member 15 and can thereafter be rotated in the two opposite directions, which rotation is followed by the driving wheel. According to the invention both locking parts comprise teeth 6, 7 or the like, which are in engagement with each other in the locked position.
