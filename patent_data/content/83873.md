# PHOTOGRAPHIC ROLL FILM CARTRIDGE AND FILM STRIP ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
In a film cartridge employing roll film with a backing strip, film flatness is improved by a providing a free loop of backing strip in the film take up chamber to guarantee that there will always be a surplus of backing strip in that chamber so that only the film will be tensioned by the rotation of the take up roll, and b preferably attaching the trailing end of the film to the backing strip, thereby preventing relative slippage between the paper and the backing strip, resulting from clock springing of the film supply roll.
