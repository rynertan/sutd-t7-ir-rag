## Description
BACKGROUND OF TFfE INVENTION she present invention relates to a high efficiency apparatus for producing thermal power or energy. As it is well knows, the great power requirements due to the increasing difficulties related to the finding or conventional power sources, such as oil and gas, brought about The need of searching upon new alternative power sources and providing high erficiency apparatus, On the other hanG,the obtained results have made well clear The difficulties associated with That problem,since the proposed solutions are very expensive and scarcely reliable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION hus,the task of The present invention is to solve The Thereinabove mentioned problem by providing such an apparatus which is effective to meet the power requirements at comparatively low costs. Within that task, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a high efficiency apparatus ror producing thermal power,while being very reliable and sure in operation. Another object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus which, based on The gas expansion concept, The so called Carnot concept ,is effective to provide very satisfactory results, with a reduced size and very low costs. The thereinabove mentioned task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter,are achieved by a high efficiency apparatus for producing thermal power,characterized in That it comprises a tank for collecting the heated water, in The inside Thereof a condenser circuit is provided for storing The collected thermal power, a circuit ror using sanitary hot water and an auxiliary circuit,automatically driven, for increasing the outside storing, said condenser circuit being coupled to an evaporating circuit externally located with respect to the tank and communicating with a compressor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Further characteristics and advantages will become more apparent hereinafter Through the following detailed description of a prererred though not exclusive embodiment of a high efficiency apparatus for producing thermal power,being illustrated in the accompanying drawings, where fig.l is a partially broken away apparatus representing the high efficiency apparatus according to the present invention fig.2 represents a detail or the compressor and of The inlet coupling at the tank, at the outlet or The compressor fig.3 represents the aeolic power producing assembly and fig.4 represents the condenser. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to the numbers references of the Thereinabove mentioned figures, The high efficiency apparatus for producing thermal power, according to the present invention,comprises a tank 1 for collecting or storing the heated water,wich is covered,on the outside thereot,by a Thermally insulating layer indicated at 2. The storing tank 1 is located within an optically transparent envelope 3 erfective to provide,as it will become more apparent thereinbelow,the so called greenhouse effect, due to the heating by the sun rays. At The top Thereof The outer envelope 3 is closed by a cover 4. The apparatus, which has a substantially cylindrical overall shape,has such a size which is slightly greater than That or a conventional household electrical appliance. In The inside or said storing tank 1 there is provided a condenser circuit 5 which,for high efficiency reasons is completely immersed in said storing tank,thereby preventing thermal losses. At the outlet end of said condenser circuit, as it is clearly illustrated in fig.4,there is provided a siphon or trap portion 6,effective to form a liquefied gas layer,as obtained from the comparatively low temperature present in The inside of said storing tank. In order to further improve the thermal exchange there is provided,at the base or bottom portion or said storing tank l,a Throwing trap 7,whereat There is provided the return inlet, indicated at 6,of The using circuit ana the inlet of the gases exiting The compressor 10 at high temperature. The compressor 10 is coupled to an evaporator circuit ll,located externally with respect to the storing tank 1 and communicating with said condenser circuit 5. 3aid using circuit may consist or any suitable circuits for conditioning rooms and the like. On the bottom or The storing tank 1There is provided a quartzite layer,indicated at 15, effective to aid the mixing Through the overall crosssection of the storing tank of the water to be heated, in order to prevent preferential streams from forming. On The outside of the storing tank which,as thereinabove mentioned,is thermally insulated, the mentioned evaporating circuit 11 extends,coiled on the outside of the insulating material, thereby allowing for the gases, driven by a suitable compressor, to provide the so called greenhouse effect,by exploiting the sun rays and the optically transparent outside envelope or cover 3. In order to further increase the thermal power to be brought to The evaporator a thermally insulated circuit has been provided in said evaporator, indicated at 20 in the accompanying drawings, which affords The possibility of absorbing heat from the ventilating air contacting The apparatus,wnthout disrupting The mentioned greenhouse effect. That circuit, which uses a carrier fluid, eetends inside the evaporator, thereby The latter is cooled by the impinging gases and heat is conseajiently absorbed. Title circulating fluid exits the apparatusThrough the exchanger, to be heated again,consideringThat in said evaporator the fluid is being cooled. The carrier fluid is driven by a reduced size circulating device,which is controlled by a temperature switch as in the encompassing region, which provides the mentioned greenhouse erfect,the heat is not sufficient to meet the evaporator requirements. An especially provided bypass path,inicated at 21 allows for the apparatus, in summer or under particular outside heat conditions,to operate also with the compressor 10 in the off or idling condition, since this circuit is able of practically operate as a solar compressor. The apparatus circuits allow for thermal power to be collected, as produced in the encompassing environment both in the form of solar power, acetic power, and in the form or power irradiated by the light. To that end,at The base or bottom portion or the transparent outer envelope 3, There is provided a parabolic shield 30 which,by preventing the sun rays from being scattered,concentrates the latter on the evaporator. The apparatus operates, as alternative power sources are not available,by automatically selecting the system to be adopted in order to obtain The maximum efficiency. Ir the power sources are individually lacking,Then the apparatus starts a polyvalent type or process or the several circuits. The apparatus,as designed, is able or suitably collect and hold any heat source which is present. Thus the apparatus is able of operating even with poor possibilities or thermal absorption and, in this case, The use of The compressor is prolonged depending on the contingent needs. The apparatus may iso be provided, depending on the needs, with a circuit for refrigerating rooms in s er,schematically indicated at 40 in fig.l,by increasing The refrigerating efficiency values with the use or conventional exhausters. In actual practice The disclosed apparatus is able of contempraneously meeting a double requirement The first is that of producing refrigerated air and the second consists or the production of hot water for sanitary use, while maintaining a single body of reduced size. The apparatus, as designed,may be located on any balconies or suitable size,and it does not require any stack to be used, thereby reducing at a minimumThe air pollution. It should also be noted that The elctrical power for operating the apparatus is very reduced. Koreover,in order to further improve the already high efficiency or the apparatus, the latter is covered by a particular paint, in order to maximally exploit any light forms to increase The thermal power.That paint consists of a mixture of an opaque synt het black enamel and sand, effective to provide an exchanger surface simultaneously black and greatly porous, Thereby preventing the sun rays from being rerlected. In addition to the mentioned paint on the outside surface of the evaporator ll,a quartzite material is also added, effective to provide the so called beach effect, Thereby further improving efficiency. From The above disclosure it will be clear That the apparatus according to the present invention fully achieves the intended objects. In particular,the fact is to be pointed out that the apparatus allows for clean power to be produced,with a very high efficiency level, therebyThe subject apparatus will be very advantageous in all of The practical applications thereof. The invention,as disclosed, is susceptible to several modifications and variations,all Thereof fall within the scope or The invention idea. Moreover all of The details may be replaced by other technically equivalent elements. In practicing The invention the used materials,as well as the contingent shape and size,will be any depending on The needs.
