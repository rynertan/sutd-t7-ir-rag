# SHAPED ARTICLES FROM FIBRE COMPOSITE MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method of forming a shaped article comprising providing a feedstock consisting of a plurality of superim posed layers of parallel, aligned filaments in a thermoform able polymer matrix in which the continuous filaments have been severed in predetermined positions in the layers, heating the feedstock to a temperature at which the thermo formable polymer matrix can be formed, clamping the plurality of layers at the perimeter of the superimposed layers and applying a differential pressure across the clamped assembly of layers to cause relative movement of the layers enabling the feedstock to take up a desired shape. The method enables a greater degree of forming to be achieved whilst at the same time giving greater control over the disposition of the filaments in the final article.
