# Mobile sweepers.

## Abstract
A mobile sweeper has a framework 13 supporting a hopper 21 for receiving dust and debris swept from an underlying surface. A broom chamber 32 is mounted on the framework 13 to overlie the surface to be swept and is in communication with the hopper 21 . The broom chamber 32 can move vertically relative to the framework 13 . A rotary driven broom 53 is mounted on the broom chamber 32 and is capable of limited vertical movement relative to the chamber 32 . A resilient tubular seal 84 is disposed between the broom chamber 32 and the hopper 21 so that a dust seal is maintained therebetween while the broom chamber 32 undergoes vertical movement. A bump encountered on the underlying surface elevates the broom chamber 32 permitting the sweeper to pass thereover while allowing the broom 53 to descend and continue in sweep ing contact with the surface.
