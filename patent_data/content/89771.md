## Description
TITLE ATCC HBC11G AND ITS OMOCLONAL ANTI 9 Y ANTIBODY, HYCLONALAN BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to materials and methods for use in immunological procedures for selection and differentiation of mammalian male and female cells. More specifically, the invention relates to a monoclonal anti H Y antibody, Hyclonalan, produced by a novel tumor cell line ATCC HB8116 and to uses of Hyclonalan in sex immunoselection procedures. Sex immunoselection allows the separation and identification of male from female cells according to immunological reactions of antibodies specific for antigens on the cell surface. Such immunological reactions could mediate sex differentiation, for example, in a pool of embryos supplied by a female animal, or in a pool of X and Y bearing spermatozoa from a male animal. Gender differentiated embryos or sperm may thereafter be utilized for embryo implantation or artificial insemination of the same or analogous species surrogate females for the preselection of the desired sex of the offspring. As one example, in the cattle industry, methods for sex immunoselection could be of vital use in upgrading the nutritional characteristics and quantities of cattle raised to supply food and milk.While a cow of reproductive age will normally give birth to only one calf a year, which may be either a male or a female, accurate techniques of immunoselection could allow the birth of many genetically superior calves of a sing e sex as offspring of one genetically desirable cow. This could be accomplished by subjecting a aroup of hormonally induced ova from the genetically desirable cow either to fertilization and embryo imnunoselection or to artificial insemination by sex preselected sperm. Embryos thus obtained e.g., all females may be implanted into the uteri of surrogates and thereby the desirable genetic characteristics of the parent animals can be propagated with much greater frequency than is possible in nature.The ability to increase the reproductive capacity of genetically prized animals, especially dairy cattle, may be a key to solving the hunger problem which exists in many countries today due to insufficient numbers of meat producers. These technologies also show great promise in increasing the chances for survival of many endangered species. Animal experiments with interspecies embryo transfer have already shown that such techniques may ultinately prove successful in multiplying the flagging numbers of endangered species of mammals by implanting sex preselected, genetically desirable embryos from an endangered species into an analogous species surrogate. In addition, sex immunoselection procedures are also directed at detection of microcellular sex determinants. In individuals with ambiguous gender development, such techniques are utilized to identify abnormal sex chromosome constitutions, particularly in human fibroblast cells. Current investigation involves immunological techniques to detect the H Y antigen, the cell surface component found on the male cells of all mammals. The locus of at least one of the genes responsible for H Y expression is on the Y chromosome, and has been shown to be cross reactive among numerous species ranging from fish to man. It has been proposed that the H Y antigen may be the primary sex determinant and possibly the long sought inducer of testicular development in mammals. Wachtel, et al., 1975 Wachtel and Koo, 1980 Koo, et al., Application ofMonoclonal Anti H Y Antibody for Human H Y Typing, Human Genetics, 57 64 67 1981 . One of the limitations in current serological and immunological techniques used to detect the H Y antigen on male cells, including those cells forming Y bearing spermatozoa and male embryos is the source of antiserum. Antiserum is conventionally produced by injecting the antigen of interest into an immunologically responsive laboratory animal such as a mouse or rat and subsequently preparing antiserum from the blood of the animal, which will contain a mixture of antibodies developed against the antigen toqether with other antibody substances. For example, Rryant, U.S. Patent 4,191,749, granted March 4, 1980, discloses a separation scheme for male and female determining spermatozoa utilizing a male specific antibody. The antibody of this reference is prepared from the serum of female rabbits hyperimmunized with male rabbit epidermal cells. The antiserum, which must be complement inactivated, is purified by being repeatedly absorbed with washed female rabbit spleen cells and fractionated by agarose gel filtration to obtain the Immunoqlobulin G IgG antiserum fraction. Despite current scientific dispute concerninq the presence of the H Y antigen in haploid expression on the surface of spermatozoa, theoretically, X bearing sperm will elute out of a column in which Bryants IrrLrnunoglobulin G antiserum is coupled with solid phase immunosorbent material, while the Y bearing sperm attach to the antiserum on the column. The Y bearing sperm are then eluted out of the column separately with more antiserum solution in accordance with the principles of competitive binding. Such conventionally produced Tj Y antiserum, although it contains H Y antibodv substances, is usually low titered and contaminated with heteroantibody which will react with male and female cells of other species due to species specific cell surface components which are not related to the H Y antigen. Therefore clinical assays using the H Y antiserum to detect the H Y antigen cn male cells or aid in separating male embryos and Y bearing spermatozoa from female embryos and X bearing spermatozoa will often yield ambiguous and inaccurate results in embryo trans erral and fertilization experiments. This ambiguity in anti H Y antiserum is also disadvantageous when used in serologic procedures for the detection of H Y antigen expression in patients both animal and human that demonstrate ambiguous sexual development hermaphroditic differentiation or other physical conditions caused by genetic aberrancies in the sex chrorosomes. Hermaphroditic differentiation is believed to be caused by the presence of Y chromosome material as an intact Y chromosome in a mosaic cell line, as a minute part of the extra material attached to an X chromosome or as an autosome. Because the chiornosome segments and genes which form them are so small, the usual cytological assays cannot always detect them.Serological detection of H Y antigen expression of these chromosome segments and genes is considered the best evidence of these genotypic abnormalities.However, the serological assays are only as precise in locating the genetic abnormality as in the anti H Y antiserum available for use. Wachtel, et al., Serologic Detection of a Y Linked Gene in XX Males and XX True Hermaphrodites, New Enqland J. Med., 295 750 754 1976 . Researchers in this field have therefore turned to hybridoma techniques to produce tumor cell lines which will manufacture highly specific monoclonal H Y antibody. Techniques used for the production of monoclonal antibody are well known in the art, and can be found described in Oi, V.T. andL.A. Herzenberg, Immunoqlobulin Producing Hybrid,1, Mishell, B.R. and S.I, Shiigi eds. , Selected lethods in Cellular Immunology San Francisco W.H. H, Freeman Publishing, 1979. Lymphocytes removed from the spleen of an animal previously injected with the antigen of interest are allowed to fuse with myeloma cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol or a similar fusogen. Thousands of hybrid myeloma cells are produced from the fusion. The supernatant from growth of each hybridoma cell culture is tested for the presence of the desired antibody activity. hen such activity is found in the supernatant of one cell culture, it is cloned by limiting dilutions, and the clones produced are individually assayed for supernatant activity. To date, monoclonal antibody methodologies have produced monoclonal anti H Y antibodies of widely varying specificities and phvsiological characteristics. An II Y antibody less than highly specific, however, will not provide an accurate detection of solely the H Y antigen cell surface which will enable identification and separation of male from female cells and accurate prediction of the results of sex immunoselection techniques, or locate fragments ofY chromosomes in cells of patients with abnormal sex chromosome constitutions. There exists, therefore, a substantial need for a highly specific monoclonal H Y antibody to improve the accuracy of sex immunoselection of cells for purposes of artificial insemination and embryo transferral particularly in the areas of upgrading animal herds and increasing the populations of endangered mammalian species and for identification of genetic abnormalities.

BRIEF SUP D1ARY The present invention provides a new mouse mouse hybridoma cell line, ATCC HB8116, which provides as a component of the supernatant of its growth the highly specific monoclonal H Y antibody,Hyclonalan. ATCC designates the American TypeCulture Collection in Rockville, Maryland, a recognized public depository for strains of microorganisms. The present invention provides for the use of Hyclonalan in immunological procedures for sex differentiation in mammalian cells, including embryonic cells, sperm cells, epidermal cells, and fibroblast cells. According to the practice of the present invention, a tumor cell line is produced using a standard immunological technique described in Oi andHerzenberg, Immunoglobulin Producing Hybrid, supra.Spleen cells from female mice, hyperimmunized with injections of male mouse spleen cells, are fused with a mouse myeloma cell line in the presence of a chemical fusogen. A selected hybridoma cell cloned to propagate the cell line ATCC HB8116 produces an antibody in its growth supernatant which has highly specific anti H Y antibodv action. This a . ibodv, named Hvclonalan, shows specific attraction for theH Y antigen on male mammalian cells in various irnmunoloc ical proceaures including an epiderral cell cytotoxicity assay, an embryo cytotoxicity assay, and a radio immuno binding assay. In immunological procedures to separate male from female embryos, Hyclonalan, in the presence of complement, demonstrates cytolytic effect on male cells, and no effect on female cells. The cytolysis of cells on the male embryos is microscopically observable, thereby enabling differentiation of the embryos into male and female pools. Immunoselection techniques utilizing the monoclonal antibody of the present invention are also useful in the identification and separation of male from female epidermal and fibroblast cells, and in the detection of human sex chromosome abnormalities. Additionally, Hyclonalan in immunological techniques for identification and separation of X andY bearing spermatozoa is at least as effective as the antiserum disclosed in Brans, U.S. Patent 4,191,749. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the procedure for production of cell lineATCC HB8116, female mice of strain C57BL 6 B6 Jackson Laboratory were hyperimmunized to the H Y antigen by inoculating intraperitoneally with 2.5 x 107 B6 male spleen cells every two weeks for fourteen weeks. Three days prior to removal of the spleens from the females, they were given a tail vein boost of 5.0 x 10 B6 male spleen cells. Spleen cells removed from these females comprised the immune donor spleen cells for practice of the procedure of Oi and Herzenberg, suora. The parental mveloma cell line used in the present invention was the NS 1 cell line P3 NS1 1, Cell Distribution Center, Salk Institute .Procedures for preparing and maintaining the MS 1 myeloma cell line are also disclosed in the Oi andHerzenberg publication. Briefly, fusion of the NS 1 myeloma cells and the B6 immune spleen cells occurred in the presence of the fusogen, polyethylene glycol 1500 BOHChemicals . Cell membranes fused and initially surrounded a common cytoplasm with two or more nuclei.Several days after that event, the nuclei fused and became capable of synchronous mitosis. As these fused cells divided, a variable number of chromosomes of both fused partners were lost until the hybrid cell line stabilized. Selection of NS l spleen cell hybrids from the fusion which also produces NS 1 NS 1 and spleen spleen cell hybrids was accomplished by culturing the fusion mixture in hypoxanthineaminopterin thymidine HAT medium for two weeks. HAT medium prevented NS l NS 1 hybrids from growing. The spleen spleen cell hybrids generally died after two weeks in culture. Thus the HAT medium allowed growth of only the NS l spleen hybrid cells. After the two weeks in HAT medium, theNS l spleen cell hybrids were transferred to RPMI Growth Medium for continuous cultured growth. RPMIGrowth Medium designates a medium composed of RPMI medium Gibco supplemented with 10 Fetal Calf Serum Sterile Systems , 1 Penicillin Streptomycin Gibco , 1 Essential Amino Acids Gibco , 1 Glutamine Gibco , and 1 Sodium Pyruvate Gihco . After approximately two more weeks of cell growth, the supernates of cultures were individually harvested and tested in undiluted form for antibody activity. After finding antibody activity in individual cell cultures, the cells were cloned by transfer into 1 milliliter cultures in culture plates using BAJ,B c thymocytes as feeder cells. After one week, the supernate of each culture was retested for antibody activity. Positive cultures were then cloned by limiting dilution in RPt1I Growth Medium in microtiter wells containing 105 BALTIC thymocytes and splenocytes as the feeder layer. Once these dilutions in RPMI Growth Medium were tested for antibody production, positive clones were transferred into RPMI Growth Medium in larger flasks. Following these procedures, cell line ATCCHB8116 was found to produce a specific anti H Y monoclonal antibody in its supernate. Generation of Hyclonalan containing supernate using ATCC HB8116 is accoitplished by continuous cultured growth in RP 1T Growth medium at 370C in air. Optimal recovery ofHyclonalan in supernate when ATCC HB8116 is grown in RPhII Growth Medium is presentlv achieved when the concentration is 2 x 106 cells per milliliter. Alternatively Hyclonalan can be obtained by the ascites method. In this procedure, cells of ATCCHB8116 are injected into the peritoneal cavities of mice, which had received 1 milliliter of Pristane Aldrich two weeks before inoculating with 5 x 106Hyclonalan cells. Pristane permits growth of tumor cells in an ascitic form within the peritoneal cavitv.One day before incoulation the mice received an additional 1 milliliter of Pristane and a 500 R dose of X irradiation, which permits cells to initially grow. Once the ascitic tumor cells crow, the mouse is sacriffliced and the ascitic fluid containing the H Y antibody is separated from the cells by centrifuqation at 1000 rpm. While this procedure produces a smaller volume of Hyclonalan, it is a more concentrated antibody than that produced in tissue culture.Dilution of the ascites fluid Hyclonalan preparations before use therefore produces a comparable effect to undiluted tissue culture supernatant Hyclonalan preparations. Assays and tests to determine Hyclonalan s physiological characteristics have revealed that the antibody proteinaceous in nature, contains kappa light amino acid chains, and is able to lyse cells in the presence of complement. A characteristic unexpected in light of the work of other experimenters on H Y monoclonal antibody is that Hyclonalan does not bind Protein A See, Koo, et al., supra. The following examples illustrate immunological assays on the monoclonal antibody of the present invention, and more specifically relate to assays evidencing Hyclonalan s specificity for the H Y antigen on mice epidermal cells and human fibroblast cells, Hyclonalan s kappa light chain constituency,Hyclonalan s cytotoxic characteristics, and use of its cytotoxicity in differentiating embryonic cells by gender. Example 1 Cytotoxicity Test on Mouse Epidermal Cells To determine the specificity of Hyclonalan for the male cell surface antigen, H Y, and to determine the antibody s cytotoxic cell lysis activity in the presence of complement, an assay was performed by a colleague of the inventor MarkShapiro, the University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1981 . The assay incubated male and female mouse epidermal cells withHyclonalan and complement. The cytotoxic index measures the percentage of cells lysed hy exposure toHyclonalan and complement. The greater the index, the greater the number of cells lysed. Table I Cytotoxic Treatment IndexMale Cells incubated with Hvclonalan and complement 0.17Male cells incubated with Hyclonalan previously absorbed with male cells without complement , and complement 0.02Male cells incubated with Hyclonalan previously absorbed with female cells without complement , and complement 0.16 These results show that when male cells are incubated with Hyclonalan in the presence of complement, a hiah degree of cytotoxicity is observed. When male cells are incubated with Hyclonalan alone, the H Y activity was removed, so that other male cells incubated with the re collected Hyclonalan in the presence of complement demonstrated little cvtotoxic effect, indicated by an index of 0.02. Incubation of female cells which do not contain the H Y antigen inHyclonalan alone did not decrease the cytoxic activity. Thus when male cells were incubated with the re collected Hyclonalan in the presence of complement, a high cytotoxic index was again observed, indicating that the antibody Hyclonalan is specific for the male surface antigen H Y. This assay also revealed the physiologic characteristic of Hyclonalan as a complement binding or cytotoxic antibody. ExamDle 2 Radio Tmmuno Binding Assay on Human Fibroblast Cells This example. relates to immunological procedures evidencing the anti H Y specificity ofHyclonalan and its physiological composition of kappa light amino acid chains. The procedure was performed by a colleague of the inventor Jeanne Track, TheUniversity of Miami, Mailman Center for ChildDevelopment, Miami, Florida, 1981 . A series of microtiter plate wells are filled with 3 bovine serum albumin MilesLaboratories in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.0 and incubated for thirty minutes at room temperature and thirt minutes in a cold room. Following washing of the wells three times with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2 bovine serum albumin, 1 x. 105 human male and female fibroblast cells are added to the wells in 20 lambda volumes, separated by cell gender. Hyclonalan supernatant in a O lambda volume diluted 1 4 and i 8, as indicated in Table II, is added to each well containing the cells and is incubated for thirty minutes at 40C. The wells are spun at 1,200 rpm, then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline containing 2 bovine serum albumin while spinning at the same rate to remove excess Hyclonalan. Rabbit anti mouse Immunoglobulin G kappa antibody Bionetics , purified on a ProteinA Sepharose Cl 4B column Pharmacia , is iodinated with radioactive iodine 5 and then added to the wells in 20 lambda volures diluted in phosphate buffered saline and 2E bovine serum albumin. This 4 4 provides approximately 5 x 10 to 50 x 104 counts per well. Following incubation for thirty minutes at room temperature, the wells are washed five tines with phosphate buffered saline containing 2 bovine serum albumin at a spin of 9000 rpm to remove excess radioactive rabbit anti mouse antibody. The wells are then allowed to drv before being counted under a radioactivity counter. This second labelled antibody, rabbit antimouse kappa antibody, will bind with anyHyclonalan in the plates. Because yclonalan is mouse derived, it functions as an antigen to rabbit anti mouse antibody. The amount of radioactivity, measured in counts per minute, indicates the comparative amounts of 11 25 rabbit anti mouse antibody Hyclonalan cell surface antin complexes found in the plates. The results in Table II indicate the presence of significant amounts of Hyclonalan in the wells containing the male cells, cc.sared to the female cells, which emit counts equal to the background counts caused by the attachment of the proteinaceous antibody Hyclonalan to the plastic wells. This assay also indicates that Fyclonalan is formed of the kappa light amino acid chains, since it completed with the labelled anti kappa antibody. TABLE II No. of 125I Dilution of Anti Counts Added H Y Supernatant 125I Bound cpm Female Male Background Experiment No. 1 Male Background 500,000 cpm 1 4 2305 1147 300,000 cpm 1 4 1155 576 150,000 cpm 1 4 729 333 50,000 cpm 1 4 261 174 500,000 cpm 1 8 2734 1558 300,000 cpm 1 8 1355 758 150,000 cpm 1 8 686 459 50,000 cpm 1 8 339 226 Experiment No. 2 300,000 cpm 1 4 2066 796 This experimenter indicated that these results show significantly greater male cell differentiation than any other monoclonal anti H Y antibody which she has subjected to the same assay.For example, the monoclonal H Y antibody preparation of Koo, et al., supra, when subjected to this assay by the same experimenter, showed no difference in counts between wells containing male cells and wells containing female cells. Use of livclonalan in this assay has also indicated significant differences for comparative purposes in human fibroblast cells from humans with genetic abnormalities in their sex chromosomes, i.e., XX males. EYamDle 3 Embryo Cytotoxicity Assay The following example relates to use ofHyclonalan in the immuno se ection of mouse 8 cell embryos. The procedures involved in this assay which demonstrates the complement binding capacity ofHyclonalan as well as its use in a sex immunoselection method for mammalian embryos are described in Krco,C.J., and Goldberg, E.H., H Y Male Antigen.Detection on Eight Cell louse Embryos, Science, 193 1134 1135 1976 , with the substitution of a monoclonal anti H Y antibody, Hyclonalan, for anti H Y serum. Mouse embryos, desirablv at the 8 cell stage, are flushed from the oviducts of the donor and pooled in Whitten s medium prepared by the inventor as disclosed in Krco, et al., supra containing 0.3E bovine serum albumin Miles Labortories . Loosening and cracking of the zona pellucid rrcm the embryos is accomplished by treatment with a 1 Dronase, followed by repeated pipetting through a micropipet. Following washing with bovine serum albumin supplemented lihitten s medium, the embryos are incubated in the presence of Hyclonalan for 15 minutes at 370C in a 5 CO2 and 95 air incubator, humidified atmosphere. Embryos are then rewashed inWhitten s medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin and transferred to guinea pig serum Gibco diluted 1 2 in Whitten s medium for another 15 minute incubation under identical conditions. Once the excess complement is removed by another washing with Whitten s medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin, the embryos are observed by light microscopy. If one or more blastomeres in the embryos are lysed, the embryo is positive for the H Y antigen, and is therefore male. Embryos demonstrating no lysis are female. At the present time, approximately one hundred mouse embryos have been subjected to this assay. A 50 cytolysis rate has been demonstrated, which correlates well with the naturally occurring ratio of male female embryos. Subsequent implantations of surviving mice embryos have produced female mice. Preliminary tests of this assay on 32 cell bovine embryos have indicated consistent distributions of lysed to nonvaffected embryos for purposes of differentiating the embryos according to sex.
