## Description
This invention relates to a method for the differential diagnosis of primary and metastatic cancers by qualitative and quantitative lectin based immuno serological assays of cancer related antigens in body fluids. More particularly the invention relates to the differential diagnosis of primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma, and the differential diagnosis of oophoroma and metastatic hepatic carcinoma by affinity cross linked immuno electrophoresis ACIE of α fetal protein AFP using selected lectin pairs. Specific immuno serological assays based on the immunogenicity of cancer specific glycoproteins as tumor markers are already used in the diagnosis of cancer. Such markers include, for example α fetoprotein hereinafter referred to as AFP , carcinoembryonic antigen hereinafter referred to as CEA , γ glutamyltranspeptidase hereinafter referred to as γ GTP and human chorionic gonadotropin hereinafter referred to as HCG . For example, the measurement of serum AFP is used in the specific immunoserological diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoma. However, if the increase of serum AFP is small, it is difficult to decide whether it is caused by the regeneration of hepatocytes or by hepatoma cells. This is for the reason that serum AFP increase not only in the case of primary hepatic carcinoma, but also sometimes in the case of metastasis to the liver resulting from oophoroma, and sometimes from gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer metastatic hepatic carcinoma . Thus the differential diagnosis of primary hepatic cancer and oophoroma is hard to make on the basis of mere quantitative change in serum AFP. Lectin based affinity cross linked immunoelectrophoretic assays of serum AFP are known, and have been suggested as a basis for the differential diagnosis of liver disease. For example, Kanzo It is reported that with Con A, AFP appears in two fractions, one reactive and one non reactive, and in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma the AFP is mainly of the Con A reactive type, whereas for digestive tract tumors the AFP is 50 non reactive. In the case of LCH affinity, it is reported that three types of reactivity have been noted, namely a non reactive fraction, a weakly reactive fraction and a strongly reactive fraction. However, it is also reported that, although AFP from cirrhotic liver is mainly LCH non reactive, AFP produced by malignant tumors shows a wide distribution in affinity to LCH, with the LCH non reactive fraction varying widely from 5 to 100 . Thus, whilst the authors of that article do speculate that analysis of AFP by ACIE using Con A and LCH may prove useful in the differential diagnosis of liver disease, their results using LCH are somewhat inconclusive, and, in fact, show extreme variability. Thus, in Table I the LCH affinities of AFP from hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal tumor are reported as 41.1 34.3 and 31.6 41.9 respectively. In the diagnosis and treatment of liver disease, it is clearly important to be able to differentiate between primary and secondary metastatic disease, and in accordance with this invention, it has been found that this can be achieved using specifically selected pairs of lectins as the basis of analysis of serum AFP by affinity cross linked immuno electrophoresis ACIE . More specifically, the present invention, in one aspect, relates to a method of differentiating between primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma, which comprises subjecting a sample of body fluids, preferably a serum sample, from the patient to cross immunoaffinoelectrophoresis ACIE using a pair of lectins selected from the following lectin pairs In a second and related aspect, the invention relates to a method of differentiating between oophoroma and metastatic hepatic carcinoma, which comprises subjecting a sample of body fluids, preferably a serum sample, from the patient to cross immunoaffinoelectrophoresis ACIE using a pair of lectins selected from the following lectin pairs Preferably, in the above methods, peroxidase POD labelled protein A, 4 methoxy 1 naphthol and hydrogen peroxide are used in the development of the said binding patterns in the ACIE. Suitable body fluid samples for use in the present invention include, for example, blood, urine, saliva, gastric juice, intestinal juice, pancreatic juice, bile, cell tissue fluid, edema fluid, ascitic fluid, hydrothorax fluid, hydropericardic fluid, synovial fluid, mother s milk, nasal mucus, phlegm, tear, sweat, etc., and it is particularly preferable to use blood in the form of serum or plasma. The lectins to be used in the present invention include jack bean lectin hereinafter referred to as Con A and lentil lectin hereinafter referred to as LCH which are lectins capable of being specifically bound to α D glucose and α D mannose isolectin PHA E of kidney bean lectin hereinafter referred to as PHA which is a lectin capable of being specifically bound to N acetylgalactosamine isolectin RCA I of castor bean lectin hereinafter referred to as RCA which is a lectin capable of being specifically bound to β D galactose and isolectin BSA II of banderilla bean lectin hereinafter referred to as BSA which is a lectin capable of being specifically bound to N acetylglucosamine. In the present invention the ACIE method is used for separation and identification of the cancer related glycoantigen viz the AFP. That is, a sample containing a cancer related glycoantigen is subjected to one dimensional electrophoresis separation in a lectin containing gel, and then the individual separated fractions are subjected to two dimensional electrophoresis and coloring in an antiserum containing gel, whereby the individual fractions can be quantitatively determined as sharp precipitate peaks. The lectin bindability then can be determined from the specific change in the migration distance. In the present invention, an enzyme immunoassay is used for developing the specific fraction binding pattern after the ACIE. Particularly preferred is a coloring system comprising POD labelled protein A, 4 methoxy 1 naphthol and hydrogen peroxide which gives a clear, rapid and simple means of developing the pattern with a high sensitivity and a high separability. As already indicated by the prior art the differential diagnosis of cancer may be possible to some extent by a single bindability to lectin, but not always very satisfactorily, and it is the basis of the present invention that the diagnosis can be made more definitively by a combination of at least two lectin affinities and in particular, in the pairs already mentioned. More particularly, and as indicated above it is known that AFP which is a glycoprotein existing in the blood of patients suffering from primary hepatic carcinoma, gonadal teratoma, and oophoroma, can be separated by ACIE into several fractions due to the difference in bindability to various lectins. For example, with Con A, AFP is separated into two fractions, i.e. a Con A bound fraction and a Con A unbound fraction. It is ontogeneologically known that the Con A bound AFP originates from the hepatocytes and the Con A unbound AFP originates mostly from the vitellicle. When the serum AFP of patients suffering from primary hepatic carcinoma is assayed in the present invention, a fraction originating partly from the vitellicle hereinafter referred to as peak b is found and also an AFP fraction originating mostly from the embryonic hepatocytes hereinafter referred to as peak a . However, in metastatic hepatic carcinoma, only the AFP fraction originating from the vitellicle peak b is found. With LCH, AFP is likewise separated into 4 fractions giving four peaks A, B, C and D. It can be established from changes in AFP producing sites with the elapse of time, that peaks A and C are fractions originating from the hepatocytes, and peaks B and D are fractions originating from the vitellicle. Thus it can be seen that in AFP fraction patterns of primary hepatic carcinoma only peaks A and C are found whereas in metastatic hepatic carcinoma, peak B occurs as well as peaks A and C. That is the AFP fractions produced in the embryonic hepatocytes mainly appear in the case of the primary hepatic carcinoma, whereas in the case of metastatic hepatic carcinoma, a fraction produced in the vitellicle is found as well as the AFP originating from fetal liver. Thus, by this method and by comparing the specific binding patterns obtained with Con A and LCH it is possible to make a differential diagnosis as between primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma. The amounts of sample and of the two lectins used in the assay and the amounts and proportions of POD labelled protein A and enzyme substrate used in the development of the binding pattern and the various reaction conditions, e.g. time and temperature, depend on the substance to be assayed, the particular lectin used and the kind of carrier, used in the electrophoresis, and thus the most appropriate conditions must be determined experimentally for each assay. The method of the present invention is described in more detail below. In general, in carrying out the electrophoresis a sample of body fluid, preferably 5 to 10ml, is first subjected to one dimensional electrophoresis in a lectin containing gel containing one or other of the selected pair of lectins. After the one dimensional electrophoresis, each of the separated fractions is subjected to a second electrophoresis in a second direction in an antiserum containing gel following which the specific binding pattern is developed using an enzyme immunoassay. The concentration of lectin in the first gel depends on the lectin used, and generally the separability of the AFP fraction depends also on that concentration. A feature of the present invention is that the selected lectins offer a highly sensitive assay operable even at a low lectin concentrations of, for example, from 200 to 600 µg ml. A variety of gels can be used as the carrier, although in the case of two dimensional ACIE, it is preferable to use an agarose gel because of its low gel deformation. The carrier gel can be prepared by conventional procedures. For example, a predetermined amount of agarose is added to distilled water, or to a suitable dilute buffer solution, for example a barbital buffer solution at a pH of about 8.6 or a Tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution, and heated at a temperature of from 60 to 80 C with gentle stirring to dissolve the agarose. The solution is then spread on a flat plate and left to cool. The gel concentration is usually 0.5 to 2.0 by weight, preferably 0.8 to 1.0 by weight. An antiseptic can be added to the gel, if needed. Preferably the electrophoresis is carried at a temperature of not higher than 15 C, preferably 5 to 10 C in order to avoid drying out and deformation of the gel at these lower temperatures. The greater the one dimensional migration distance of ACIE, the greater the separation of the AFP fractions. However, a corresponding large amount of lectin will be required as well as a long migration time. In practice 6 cm is a sufficient migration distance. As a control in the electrophoresis, a coloured substance, e.g. Bromophenol Blue hereinafter referred to as BPB bound albumin is diffused in parallel with the assay sample. Overall, the two dimensional electrophoresis can be completed within 2 to 6 hours, preferably 2 to 4 hours. The invention is illustrated by the following Individual serum samples from 48 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma and 8 patients with metastatic hepatic carcinoma were diluted with normal human serum AFP less than 5 ng ml to give samples with an adjusted AFP concentration of less than 30,000 ng ml. 1.0 agarose made by FMC Marine Colloids Division, U.S.A. was dissolved in a barbital buffer solution having pH 8.6 and an ionic strength of 0.5 followed by the addition of 200 µg ml LCH. 15ml of the LCH containing agarose gel was then poured into a 110 x 125mm gel mould FMC Marine Colloids Division and coagulated to produce an LCH containing agarose plate having a thickness of about 1mm. To 10 ml. of a 1.0 agarose solution were added 20 µl of anti AFP serum DAKO Co., Denmark . 10 ml of the anti AFP serum containing agarose gel were then poured into the same gel mould and coagulated to make an anti AFP serum containing agarose plate having a thickness of about 1mm. 20µl of POD labelled protein A E.Y. Laboratories, U.S.A. were added to 10ml of a dilute buffer solution prepared by dissolving 14.0g of NaCl in 1l of barbital buffer having pH 8.6, to make a 0.2 dilute solution of POD labelled protein A. 200 µl of 4 methoxy 1 naphthol Aldrich Co., U.S.A. , 10ml of 0.05M Tris buffer solution 12.113 g l trishydroxymethylaminomethane and 0.1M HCl in a ratio of 100 77, pH 7.6 and a drop of 30 H₂O₂ were mixed together to make a coloring reagent solution immediately before use. 10 µl serum samples prepared as in section a were poured into 4mm holes in the LCH containing agarose plate prepared as in section b and then subjected to one dimensional electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was carried out using a barbital buffer solution pH 8.6 at 3 mA cm for 90 minutes at 10 C. As a control, human serum albumin fraction V, made by Sigma Co., U.S.A., containing 5µl of 0.01 BPB was used and the migration distance marked about 6cms. After the one dimensional electrophoresis, the agarose plate was cut into 1 cm. wide strips parallel to the direction of migration and placed on top of the anti AFP serum containing agarose plate prepared in section c and in close contact with the anti AFP serum containing gel. The assembly was then subjected to a second electrophoresis in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the original one dimension development, at 2.5 mA cm for 3 hours at 10 C. After the migration, the plate was treated with an adsorbent pad Nihon Shoji Co., Japan for 2 to 3 minutes for elimination of any unbound substances, and then washed with a phosphate buffer solution pH 7.2 for 30 minutes. The plate was then dried with an adsorbent pad, and 10 ml of POD labelled protein A, prepared as in section d , was poured onto the flat plate. After reaction for 30 minutes, the plate was dried with an adsorbent pad, washed with a phosphate buffer solution pH 7.2 for 30 minutes and redried with an adsorbent pad. 10ml of the coloring reagent solution, prepared as in section e , were then added and the plate allowed to react for 2 to 3 minutes. The developed plate was then washed with water for 2 to 3 minutes and dried with an adsorbent pad. The distance from the albumin position obtained by the one dimensional electrophoresis to the migration peak obtained in the two dimensional electrophoresis was measured. From these results, typical migration patterns of sera from patients suffering from hepatic carcinoma can be obtained and are seen to be divided into four types Type I in which only peak A appears Type II in which only peak C appears Type III in which two peaks, i.e. both peak A and peak C appear and Type IV in which peak B appears with or without peaks A and or peak C. Type III can be further sub divided quantitatively into two sub types Type IIIa in which peak A is higher than peak C and Type IIIb in which peak C is higher than peak A. Type IV can be further sub divided into three sub types Type IVa in which two peaks, i.e. peak A and peak B, appear Type IVb in which peaks A, B and C appear and Type IVc in which only peak B appears. As shown in Table 1, AFP in the sera from patients suffering primary hepatic carcinoma is fractionated into Type I, Type II and Type III, whereas that from patients with metastatic hepatic carcinoma is all fractionated into Type IV, thus enabling a preliminary differentiation between the primary hepatic carcinoma and metastatic hepatic carcinoma. Exactly the same procedure was carried out as in Example 1, except that a Con A Pharmacia Fine Chemicals containing agarose plate Con A 600 µg ml was used in place of the LCH containing agarose plate. From these results a second set of typical migration patterns of sera of patients suffering from hepatic carcinoma by Con A ACIE can be obtained and are seen to be divided into three types Type 1 in which only peak As shown in Tables 2 and 3, AFP in the sera from patients with primary hepatic carcinoma is fractionated into Type 1 only peak a and Type 2 peak a peak b , whereas that from patients with metastatic hepatic carcinoma is fractionated into Type 2 peak a peak b and Type 3 thus enabling a preliminary differentiation between primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma. Following the same procedure as in Example I ACIE assays were carried out on individual serum samples from 5 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma, 4 patients with metastatic hepatic carcinoma, 4 patients with oophoroma, and one patient with orchioncus except that a PHA E E.Y. Laboratories, USA containing agarose plate PHA E 200 µg ml was used in place of the LCH containing agarose plate. Four migration peaks were identified on the basis of the migration distances shown in Table 4, and identified herein as peaks A, B, C and D. From these results, the migration patterns of sera of patients suffering from oophoroma, primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma and orchioncus are established and shown to be divided into two types Type 1 in which only peaks C and D appear either singly or together and Type 2 in which peaks A and C or B and C appear together peak B appears alone or peaks B, C and D all appear. Type 2 is thus characterized by appearance of either peak A or peak B shown as underlined in Table 5 . No specific change in the AFP fractions appearing in amniotic fluid during pregnancy period was observed using PHA E ACIE. However, distinctive migration patterns were observed with the sera of cancer patients, as shown in Table 5. Using the same serum samples as in Example 3 RCA I ACIE assays were carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that an RCA I E.Y. Laboratories containing agarose plate RCA I 200µg ml was used in place of the LCH containing agarose plate. Four migration peaks were identified on the basis of the migration distances shown in Table 4 and identified herein as peaks A, B, C and D. From these results, the migration patterns of sera from patients suffering from oophoroma, primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma and orchioncus were established and shown to be divided into three types. Type 1 in which peaks C and D appear either singly or together Type 2 in which peaks A and C or A and D appear, or in which all three peaks A, C and D appear together and Type 3 in which either peaks A, B and D appear together, or just peaks B and D appear. Type 2 and Type 3 are thus characterized by appearance of peak A and or B shown as underlined in Table 6 . No specific change in the AFP fractions appearing in amniotic fluid during pregnancy were observed using RCA I ACIE. However, distinctive migration patterns were observed in the sera of cancer patients as shown in Table 6. Using the same serum samples as in Example 3 BSA II ACIE assays were carried out in the same manner as in Example 1 except that a BSA II E.Y. Laboratories containing agarose plate BSA II 200 µg ml was used in place of the LCH containing agarose plate. Four migration peaks were identified on the basis of the migration distances shown in Table 4, and identified herein as peaks A,B, C and D. From these results the migration patterns of sera from patients suffering from oophoroma, primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma and orchioncus are established and shown to be divided into two types Type 1 in which only peak C or D appear as single peaks and Type 2 in which peaks A, B and D all appear or just peaks B and D. Type 2 is thus characterized by appearance of peak A and or peak B shown as underlined in Table 7 . No specific change in the AFP fractions appearing in amniotic fluid during pregnancy period were observed in BSA II ACIE. However, distinctive migration patterns were observed in the sera of cancer patients, as shown in Table 7. The following Examples illustrate the specific methods of the present invention in confirming the differential diagnosis of primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma, on the one hand, or oophoroma and metastatic hepatic carcinoma on the other. The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 2, that is, the four cases showing a relatively high peak b value 14 or higher in the primary hepatic carcinoma and the six cases showing a relatively low peak b value 45 or lower in the metastatic hepatic cancer in the patient sera classified into type 2 by Con A were checked by the results of fraction patterns by LCH Example 1 . As a result, it was found that all the primary hepatic carcinoma belonged to type III, and that all the metastatic hepatic carcinoma belonged to Type IV, thus enabling a clearly established differentiation as between primary and metastatic disease. The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 2, that is, the cases showing a relatively high peak b value 14 or higher in the primary hepatic cancer and the cases showing a relatively low peak b value 45 or lower in the metastatic hepatic carcinoma in the patient sera belonging to type 2 by Con A were compared with the results of Example 3. As a result, it was confirmed that all the primary hepatic carcinoma belonged to Type 1, and that all the metastatic hepatic carcinoma belonged to Type 2. The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 3, that is, the sera of patients suffering from oophoroma showing Type 1 by PHA E ACIE were classified into Type 3 by comparison with the results of the RCA I ACIE Example 4 . Conversely the sera of patients suffering from the metastatic hepatic carcinoma showing Type 1 by RCA I ACIE Example 4 were classified into Type 2 by comparison with the results of the PHA E ACIE Example 3 . The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 3 that is, sera of patients suffering from oophoroma showing Type 1 by PHA E ACIE were classified into Type 1 by comparison with the results of the BSA II ACIE Example 5 . Conversely the sera of patients suffering from the metastatic hepatic carcinoma showing Type 1 by BSA II ACIE Example 5 were classified into Type 2 by comparison with the results of the PHA E ACIE Example 3 . The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 4, that is, sera of patient suffering from metastatic hepatic carcinoma showing Type 1 by RCA I ACIE were classified into Type IVb by comparison with the results of LCH ACIE Example 2 . The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 4 that is, sera of patients suffering from metastatic hepatic cancer showing Type 1 by RCA I ACIE were classified into Type 2 by comparison with the results of the BSA II ACIE Example 5 . Conversely the sera of patients suffering from metastatic hepatic carcinoma showing Type 1 by BSA II ACIE were classified into Type 3 by comparison with the results of the RCA I ACIE Example 3 . The cases of obscure differentiation in Example 5, that is, sera of patients suffering from metastatic hepatic carcinoma showing Type 1 by BSA II ACIE were classified into Type IVb by comparison with the results of the LCH ACIE. Thus, it is shown that by comparing the results of individual ACIE s using selected pairs of lectins, differential diagnosis can confidently be made as between primary and metastatic hepatic carcinoma and between oophoroma and metastatic hepatic carcinoma.
