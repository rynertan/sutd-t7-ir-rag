# Low pressure electric discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A low pressure electric discharge lamp has its end elec trodes 24 connected through the lamp envelope 2 then to pins 28 projecting from the curved sidewall of the envelope. This construction permits the electrodes to be physically located closer to the lamp ends, and decreases end illumination falloff.
