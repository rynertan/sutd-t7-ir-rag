# Process for cleaning of waste materials by refining and or elimination of biologically Difficult to degrade halogen , nitrogen and or sulfur compounds.

## Abstract
Liquid waste materials, contaminated with biologically dif ficult to degrade halogen, nitrogen and or sulfur containing compounds and containing 0.1 60 WT. halogen up to 10 WT sulfur and or small amounts of nitrogen, are cleaned or purified by conditioning these materials and passing them together with hydrogen over a guard column filled with absorbent, preferably granular alumina, under a hydrogen pressure of 30 80 bar and with an LHSV of 0.5 2.5H ยน and subsequently passing the stream over a hydrogenating catalyst, preferably a catalyst comprising nickel or cobalt plus molybdenum supported on an inert carrier. The catalyst is preferably a sulfided catalyst.
