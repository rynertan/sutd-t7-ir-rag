## Description
PROCESS FOR OXIDATION AND AMMOXIDATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to the oxidation and ammoxidation of methanol or formaldehyde to hydrogen cyanide or methanol to formaldehyde.Description of the Prior Art Hydrogen cyanide is a basic chemical building block for many chemical processes. Hydrogen cyanide has been mainly produced by the ammoxidation of methane Andrussow process and is also obtained as a by product in the preparation of acrylonitrile by the ammoxidation of propylene. Because hydrogen cyanide is poisonous, shipment of large amounts of hydrogen cyanide has been avoided. Usually hydrogen cyanide is produced and consumed at the same location. The Andrussow process is described in U.S.Patent 2,006,981. Frequently, hydrogen cyanide consuming facilities were developed next to facilities that produced hydrogen cyanide, e.g., acrylonitrile units.Recent improvements in the catalysts for acrylonitrile production have resulted in increased yields of acrylonitrile at the expense of reduced yields of hydrogen cyanide. Accordingly, there has been quite a demand for better methods of making hydrogen cyanide from inexpensive, easily transportable, starting materials such as methanol or formaldehyde. In Japanese Kokai 51 1976 10200, a metal oxide catalyst for the ammoxidation of methanol toHCN, consisting of antimony and at least one of iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, zinc, and uranium, with an atomic ratio of antimony to additional elements varying from 1 10 to 10 1 is disclosed. This catalyst can be used with or without a support, but a silica support is preferred. Japanese Kokai 54 1979 126698 discloses a catalyst for ammoxidation of methanol to HCN, which catalyst is supported on 30 to 70 weight percent silica and has the following empirical formula AaMoBibFefNanPpOq npq where A is potassium, rubidium, or cesium, Mo is molybdenum, Bi is bismuth, Fe is iron, Na is sodium,P is phosphorus, and 0 is oxygen and the subscripts represent the number of atoms of each component. U.S. Patent 3,911,089 discloses a process for preparing hydrogen cyanide from methanol or formaldehyde using a catalyst primarily containing molybdenum and bismuth oxide. In its broadest teaching, there is disclosed a catalyst whose active components correspond to the formula MOaBibFecXdYe ZfOg wherein X is Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, Sn, W or Pb, Y is one or more of T1 and elements of Group IA or IlA in the Periodic Table, and Z is one or more of P, As, and Sb. The catalyst can be used alone or is preferably incorporated on a suitable carrier such as silica, alumina, diatomaceous earth, silicon carbide or titanium oxide. The catalysts disclosed in the examples of this patent usually contain three to six active elements, not counting the support and oxygen. Many of the catalysts disclosed contain small amounts of iron and phosphorus, in addition to the molybdenum and bismuth which are the primary catalytic components. The iron is present in substantial quantities, although the phosphorus was usually present in relatively small, almost trace amounts, in Examples 3 through 40. Two examples, 41 and 42, have relatively larger amounts of phosphorus anJ iron present but these examples are directed toward the production of acrylonitrile by the ammoxidation of propylene, with incidental conversion of methanol and formaldehyde toHCN. Large quantities of steam are present to improve the selectivity to HCN. It is desirable in the art to develop an active catalyst system for use in the ammoxidation of methanol to hydrogen cyanide which would not require complicated catalyst manufacturing procedures and which would also give yields as good as or better than the more complicated prior art catalysts. It has been discovered that a very simple catalyst system is effective for the ammoxidation of methanol to hydrogen cyanide, as long as the ratio of active catalytic elements is carefully maintained. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the ammoxidation of methanol or formaldehyde feeS to hydrogen cyanide comprising passing said feed along with ammonia and oxygen or oxygencontaining gas into an ammoxidation reaction zone operated at ammoxidation conditions and containing catalytically effective amounts of at least one metal and phosphorus and wherein the atomic ratio of metal to phosphorus is within the range of 0.8 1 to 2.0 1. In a more limited embodiment, the present invention provides a process for the ammoxidation of methanol to hydrogen cyanide comprising feeding to an ammoxidation reactor operated at ammoxidation reaction conditions, a feed comprising methanol, ammonia and oxygen and wherein the ammoxidation reaction zone contains a fluidized bed of ammoxidation catalyst comprising MaPOX wherein M is at least one metal selected from the group consisting essentially of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, boron, and uranium, a is 0.8 to 2.0, and x is the total number of the oxygen atoms in the oxides of the other atoms, and hydrogen cyanide is produced in the ammoxidation reaction zone as a product of the process. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for the production of carbonyl compounds comprising passing a feed comprising an alcohol and oxygen into an oxidation zone operated at oxidation conditions and containing catalytically effective amounts of at least one metal selected from the group consisting essentially of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, boron, and uranium and phosphorus and wherein the atomic ratio of said metal to phosphorus is generally within the range of 0.8 1 to 2.0 1. For manganese catalyst, the ratio is preferably 1 1 to 1.5 1 for boron and uranium, the ratio is preferably 0.8 1 to 1.25 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The catalyst used in accordance with the present process can be prepared by conventional means. Soluble compounds of at least one metal selected from the group consisting essentially of iron, cobalt and nickel, and phosphorus can be dissolved in water, or a slurry of the catalytic elements can be formed. The solution or slurry can be mixed with the carrier, or allowed to dry as a cake, or spray dried, or any other conventional catalyst finishing steps can be used. After drying, the catalyst is preferably subjected to conventional calcination such as by heating at 200 to 10000C., preferably in an oxidizing atmosphere, to fix the catalyst composition. Although the catalyst can be used neat, it is preferred to operate with a support. Preferred are inert supports such as SiO2, TiO2, A1203, and other supports commonly used. Especially preferred is use of SiO2 and Awl203. The support may be mixed with the active catalytic components in one or more steps. No change in activity is noticed with, e.g., multi step silica addition. The support may constitute 10 90 wt of the catalyst, preferably 35 65 wt thereof. The metal compounds that can be used include any which can be incorporated into a catalyst. Preferred compounds include acetates, nitrates, oxides, halides and similar compounds of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, and uranium. When boron is the selected metal, the compounds will include boric acid, boron oxides, boron halides, and similar compounds. The phosphorus compounds that can be used include any that are known in the art, including 2 5t H3PO4, NH4H2pO4, NH4 2HPo4 and similar compounds. The ammoxidation reaction conditions used are those disclosed in the art for the ammoxidation of methanol and formaldehyde, typically, temperatures of 200 to 6000C., with better results obtained at 250 to 5500C., and best results being obtained at 300 to 500or. The oxidation reaction conditions used are about the same as ammoxidation conditions the primary difference being absence of ammonia from the feed. The molar ratio of reactants in the ammoxidation reaction zone is conventional. Usually, the molar ratio of ammonia and oxygen to methanol or formaldehyde is near stoichiometric so that most of the reactants will be consumed in the reaction.Usually, the ammonia to methanol, or formaldehyde, ratio is 0.7 1 to 2.0 1, preferably 0.9 1 to 1.3 1.Use of less ammonia increases the yield of formaldehyde from methanol, and formaldehyde is a valuable product. Use of excess ammonia is not desirable because the unreacted ammonia must be recovered and recycled, or wasted. Air is the preferred oxygen source because it is cheap however, pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air may also be used Flammable mixtures should be avoided. Some steam may be added to the reaction zone to cut down on the possibility of forming an explosive mixture. Steam may increase slightly the selectivity of the reaction for HCN. When steam is added, it will usually be present in an anoint equal to 1 to 20 mole percent of the reactants however, it is preferred to operate without steam. Steam adds to the cost of the process by increasing the mass of material flowing though the reactors and the steam must be heated and cooled, and ultimately separated from the HCN product. The catalysts of the present invention give such good results that there is no need to add steam. Inert diluents may be present, and their use is common in laboratories, but not common commercially, except for nitrogen which is usually carried along with the air supplying to the reaction zone. When the metal is manganese, it is preferred to operate with a 1.25 1 manganese phosphorus ratio. When the metal is iron, it is preferred to operate with a 1 1 iron phosphorus ratio. Operation with these ratios also gives good physical properties for the catalyst. When a support is used, M P atomic ratios of about 0.8 1 to 2.0 1 work. Better results are obtained with 0.95 1 to 1.6 1 ratio. Although it is preferred to operate with fluid bed operation, the process should work very well in a fixed bed, ebulating bed, or moving bed type of operation. A fluidized bed is preferred because problems of hot spots and distribution within the bed are minimized. Fluid bed operation also permits easy addition and withdrawal of catalyst if this is necessary to permit replacement or regeneration of catalyst. Using the catalyst of the present invention, it should be possible to use formaldehyde as a feed stock. The ammoxidation product will be the same as when a methanol feed is used, i.e., HCN. Other reactions which can be promoted using the catalysts include oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and the ammoxidation of alcohols to nitriles. Unless otherwise indicated, the catalysts of the examples described below were evaluated to determine the HCN yield and the methanol conversion in a fluidized bed reaction vessel having an inside diameter of about 14 mm. Approximately 25 grams of catalyst was used. A reaction mixture of approximately 18 volume t 02, 7 vol. ammonia, and 7 vol. methanol, and the balance helium, was passed upward through the catalyst bed to give the value of W F reported.

The following catalyst was prepared in the manner generally illustrated in Example 18. Cu,P O 84 A12 3 When this catalyst was used to make HCN from oxygen, ammonia, and methanol using a reaction temperature of 435 C., a W F ratio of 3.3, a reactor pressure of 1.7 atm, a feed volume of 6.5 methanol, 6.6 ammonia, and 16.8 oxygen, the balance of the feed being helium, virtually no HCN was obtained. EXAMPLE 28 The following catalyst was prepared in the manner illustrated in Example 21. V1.25POx 50 SiO2When this catalyst was used to make HON from oxygen, ammonia, and methanol using a reaction temperature of 457 C., a W F ratio of 1.5, a reactor pressure of 1.7 atm, a feed volume of 6.5E methanol, 6.6 ammonia and 16.8 oxygen with the balance being helium, a HCN yield of only 8.8S was obtained. It is apparent from the data in the Table that the best yields of HCN are obtained when using catalyst having a roughly one to one ratio of Fe toP. This corresponds to the stoichiometric ratio ofFe and P in ferric phosphate, FePO4. The catalyst tested in Example 17 was made from commercialFePO4.2H2O. This catalyst produced relatively high yields of HCN. This tends to confirm that FePO4 is the active catalytic component. Not all metal phosphorus oxides are effective. It has been shown that neither copper nor vanadium phosphorus oxide catalysts are effective.
