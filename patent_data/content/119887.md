# Seal assembly for closing a cavity, particularly in a rotary pump or compressor.

## Abstract
A seal assembly for closing a cavity between a rotor having an axial bore, a crankshaft extending through this bore and rotatable about an eccentric axis, and a stationary end member in which is journalled an end of said crankshaft. The seal assembly 54 according to the invention com prises a disc 72 with a first resilient member 56 that engages the rotor surface 44 and a second eccentrically positioned resilient member 62 that engages a surface 65 on end member 38 . Disc 72 which is attached to crankshaft 80 rotates with respect to both the rotor and end member to maintain a sealed cavity 55 even though the first and second resilient members 56 and 62 rotate on their respective sealing surfaces 44 and 65 with different revolutions per minute. For use in rotary pumps or compressors.
