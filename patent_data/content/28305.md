## Description
The present invention relates to certain benzene derivatives which are useful as medicaments. In particular which compounds are antiviral agents, and are especially suitable for the prevention and treatment of rhinoviral infections. The invention also relates to processes for the production of these compounds, to pharmaceutical formulations containing them and to methods of treatment employing them. In the majority of instances, the disease known as the common cold is caused by rhino viral infections, although colds may also be caused by infection of the upper respiratory tract by e.g. corona and enteroviruses. Mankind throughout the world is prone to rhinoviral infections, which are a major cause of absence from work through illness. The prevention and treatment of such diseases is thus of great economic importance. Once infected by a rhinovirus, an individual retains immunity to that serotype, which may be enhanced by continual reinfection if the serotype is prevalent in the community. There is however, no cross immunity between serotypes and thus a cold is usually experienced by an individual whenever a new rhinovirus serotype is encountered, on average about two or three times a year. Immunisation against rhinovirus is not practicable because there are about 120 known serotypes of rhinovirus and a vaccine against all these would overload the vaccinee s immune system. It would therefore appear that chemotherapy is the only suitable method for preventing or treating rhinoviral infections. Much research effort has been expended in recent years but no effective chemotherapeutic agent has yet emerged. it has now been found that certain biphenyl compounds have antiviral activity and are especially active against rhinoviruses and corona viruses. According to the present invention therefore, there is provided a compound of formula I Ar X Y Z Ar I as a medicament or in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation, wherein the groupsAr are the same or different and each is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, each of the substituents, when present, being selected from halo, lower alkyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, carboxy lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, amino, lower alkylamino, di lower alkylamino,EMI2.1 acylamino, nitro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, thiocarbamoyl, carbamoyl, carboxyl hydroxylEMI2.2 Z is a bond, C H2 , CHOH , or C O and X is oxygen, sulphur, CH2 or NH when Y is CH2 or X is C H2 when Y is oxygen or X Y together is CH CH . As used herein the expressions lower alkyl and lower alkoxy and cognate terms, mean straight or branched alkyl or alkoxy groups having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and acylamino means an amino group substituted with the residue of a carboxylic acid, in particular a lower alkyl, aryl lower alkyl or aryl carboxylic gird. Where a compound of formula I bears a hydroxyl, amino or carboxyl group or when X is a imino group, salts and esters may be formed, and these are encompassed within the present invention. It is preferred that these salts and esters be pharmaceutically acceptable,and a discussion of the properties and desirability of various salts is given in pharmaceutical salts by S.M.Berge et al, J.Pharm.Sci., 66, 1, 1977 .Some of the compounds of formula I may also exist in various stereoisomeric forms, all of which are encompassed in the present invention. In particular, those compounds having a carbon carbon double bond in the group XY will exist as geometric isomers, denoted E and Z and those having an asymmetric carbon atom, i.e. when Z is a CHOH group,will exist in enantiomeric forms. Of the various classes of compounds embraced by formula I , those in which X is oxygen, NH or CH2 , or in which X Y is CH CH , are preferred. Also preferred are those wherein Z is a bond or CH2 and those wherein each phenyl ring bears no more than three substituents, more preferably one or two substituents, and most preferably a single substituent for example substituents situated at the 3,4 and or 5 positions of the phenyl ring of a group Ar and especially at the 4 position.Particularly preferred substituents are halo, amino, hydroxyl, methyl, ethyl, methoxy ethoxy, hydroxymethyl, cyano and trifluoromethyl groups. Compounds of formula I are more preferred as medicaments or in pharmaceutically acceptable formulations when they conform to formula IA EMI3.1 wherein Rl,R2,R3 and R4 are the same or different and each is selected from the class of substituents mentioned in the preceding paragraph for example hydrogen and when R 1 and R3 are hydrogen atoms or when R1 and R2 are hydrogen atoms or when R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms. The most preferred compounds of formula I , as medicaments, or in pharmaceutically acceptable formulations, are compounds of formula IA in which R2 and R4, or R1 and R2, or R3 and R4 are both halo and the remaining pair of substituents are both hydrogen atoms. In a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of formula II EMI4.1 wherein X Y and Z are as hereinbefore defined and R5, R6, R7 and R8 are substituents selected from the class defined hereinbefore with respect to the groups Ar, except that Z is not a group when X is an oxygen atom or when X Y is a group CH CH provided that a when XYZ is a NH CH2 moiety and three of R5 to R8 are hydrogen atoms, the remaining substituent is other than a chlorine atom or a methyl or methoxy group or b when XYZ is a NH OH2 moiety and R5 and R7 are hydrogen atoms and R6 or R8 is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, the remaining substituent is other than a chlorine atom or c when XYZ is a NH CH2 moiety and R5 and R7 are hydrogen atoms and one of R6 and R3 is a hydrogen atom the remaining substituent is other than a fluorine or bromine atom or a methyl group or d when XY is a CH CH moiety and Z is other than a bond and R5 and R8 are both hydrogen atoms, R6 and R7 are not both chlorine atoms, or e when XY is a 0 C H2 moiety and Z is other than a bond, and three of R5 to R8 are hydrogen atoms, neither R6 nor R7 is a nitro group.or f when XYZ is a 0 C H2 moiety and three of R5 to R8 are hydrogen atoms, the remaining substituent is other than a methyl group or a halogen atom.or g when XYZ is a 0 OH2 moiety and R5 and R8 are hydrogen atoms, R6 and R7 are not both halogen atoms or h when XYZ is a 0 C H2 moiety and R6 is a methoxy group and R5 and R7 are both hydrogen atoms, R3 is other than a hydrogen or chlorine atom or a methoxy group or i when XYZ is a 0 C H2 moiety and R6 is a chlorine atom and R5 and R7 are hydrogen atoms, R8 is other than a halogen atom or j when XYZ is a CH CH moiety and R5 and R8 are hydrogen atoms and R6 is a cyano group, R7 is other than a nitro or methoxy group or a halogen atom or k when X is a sulphur atom, or Y is an oxygen atom, at least one of R5 to R8 is other than a hydrogen atom and excluding the following compounds 1 4 methoxyphenyl 2 phenylethane l ,3 bis 4 chlorophenyl pro pane l, 3 bis 4 chlorophenyl propanone N 3,4 dimethoxybenzyl aniline N benzyl 3,4 dimethoxyaniline N 3,4 dichlorobenzyl aniline N benzyl 3,4 dichloroaniline N 3 ch iorobenzyl 3 chloroaniline 4 chlorophenylaminomethyl 4 chlorophenyl ketone benzyl 3,4 dimethylphenyl ether 3 chlorobenzyl 4 methyiphenyl ether. 3,4 dichlorobenzyl phenyl thioether In particular aspects the present invention provides the following compounds trans I 4 cyanophenyl 2 4 chlorophenyl ethylene 1 ,2 bis 4 methoxyphenyl ethane l,2 bis 3 methoxyphenyl ethane 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl l phenylpropanone l,3 bis 4 chlorophenyl propanol 3 3, 4 dichlorophenyl I phenyipropanol 3 3, 4 dichlorophenyl l phenylpropane N 3,4 dichlorobenzyl aniline 4 chloro N 3,4 methylenedioxybenzyl aniline 4 nitro N benzylaniline 4 methyl N 4 methylbenzyl aniline 2 3,4 dichloroanilino l phenylethanol 2 4 chloroanilino 1 4 chlo rophenyl ethanol 2 3,4 dichloroanilino l phenylethane benzyl 4 hydroxyphenyl ether benzyl 3 methyl 4 chlorophenyl ether benzyl 3 nitrophenyl ether 2,4 dichlorobenzyl phenyl ether benzyl 3,4 dichlorophenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 3,4 dimethylphenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 4 ethylphenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 4 t butylphenyl ether benzyl 3 ethylphenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 2 hydroxymethyiphenyl ether 3, 4 dichlorobenzyl 3,4 dichlorophenyl ether benzyl 3 trifluoromethylphenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 4 cyanophenyl ether 4 methylbenzyl 4 methylphenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 4 carboxyphenyl ether and its methyl ester. 3,4,5 trichlorobenzyl phenyl ether 4 chlorobenzyl 3,4 dichlorophenyl ether 2 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1 phenylethane 1 ,3 bis 4 chlorophenyl prop l en 3 ol l 3,4 dichlorophenyl 3 phenylprop I en 3 ol 3 3, 4 dich lorophe nyl 1 phenylprop l ene Compounds of formula I and II may be produced by a variety of processes which are well known in the art of organic chemistry. In particular, those compounds having oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur as part of the X Y moiety will be readily produced by condensation reactions. Thus, for instande, benzyl phenyl ethers are formed by condensation of a phenol with a benzylchloride derivative and benzyl anilines are produced from benzylchloride derivatives by interaction with an aniline. Those compounds of formula I and II wherein X Y is a hydrocarbon moiety are conveniently produced by forming an unsaturated compound and then if necessary reducing the double bond. The 1,3 diphenyl propanes and propenes are produced by first making the corresponding chalcone by Knoevenagel condensation of acetophenone with benzaldehyde or derivatives thereof and then reducing either the double bond to form saturated ketones and or reducing the ketone function to provide the alcohol or alkene or alkane. A few of these reactions are illustrated in the Examples hereinbelow. Further details can be obtained from standard chemical texts. While it is possible for the compounds of formula I or II or, where appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof hereinafter referred to as the active compounds to be administered as the raw chemical it is preferred that the active compound is presented in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. In a further aspect of the invention there is therefore provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the active compound together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier there for. The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Such carriers are solid, liquid or gaseous material recommended for the purpose of administering the medicament. These pharmaceutical compositions may be administered orally or parenterally including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous injection or as a suppository or pessary or may be applied topically or as an ophthalmic solution, or may be inhaled. It is preferred that the compositions are administered orally or inhaled. For oral administration the pharmaceutical compositions may be presented as a draught in water or in a syrup, in capsules, cachets, boluses or tablets, as an aqueous or oleaginous solution or suspension or in suspension in a syrup, such suspensions optionally including suspending agents or as an oil in water or water in oil emulsion.Where desirable or necessary flavouring, sweetening, preserving, thickening or emulsifying agents may be included in the formulation. Tablets may contain the active compound as a powder or granules optionally mixed with binders, lubricants or inert diluents or surface active or dispersing agents and may be formed by compression or by moulding in an inert liquid diluent. Such tablets may be optionally scored and or coated. Capsules and cachets may contain the active compound alone or in admixture with one or more accessary ingredients. Capsules may also contain the active compound in aqueous or oleaginous solution suspension or emulsion, optionally in association with accessory ingredients. For administration as a suppository or pessary the active compound may be presented in admixture with a suitable carrier such as cocoa butter and other material commonly used in the art, the formulation conveniently being shaped by moulding. For administration in discrete dosage forms such as the tablets, capsules, suppositories and pessaries described above, the active compound is preferably presented at 0.lmg to 100mg most preferably 1 mg to l0mg per tablet, capsule, suppository or pessary. For parenteral administration the active compound may be presented in sterile solutions or suspensions in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles, which may also contain preservatives and materials for rendering the solution or suspension isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Such formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dose or multi dose sealed containers. For topical administration the composition may be presented in ointments,creams,lotions, pastes, jellies, sprays, aerosols and bath oils. Ointments and creams may have oleaginous, absorption and colloidal clay bases and may contain thickening agents such as gum tragacanth or sodium alginate and other pharmaceutically acceptable accessory ingredients such as humectants, preservatives, buffers and antioxidants which are useful in such formulations. For administration as eye drops, the active compound is presented in sterile water with excipients such as antimicrobical agents and antioxidants, as a dilute solution. For administration orally in liquid form or parenterally or as eye drops the active compound is preferably presented in solution or suspension or emulsion at a concentration of from 0.1 to 10 , more preferably 0.2to 5 w v in unit or multi dose forms. When presented in unit dose form it is preferred that each dose unit contains 0.lmg to 100mg, preferably I mg to lOmg of active compound.For inhalation the active compound may be presented in association with volatile excipients, as a cream, lotion, paste or ointment or as a finely divided dry powder or in solution for inhalation through a nasal spray, atomiser or insufflator. All the above formulations are produced by processes which comprise bringing into association the active compound and one or more carriers. According to the present invention there is therefore provided a process for producing a pharma ceuticai formulation of a compound of formula I comprising bringing into association a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. Compounds of formula I may be administered to human beings and to other mammals to treat or prevent viral diseases, especially rhinoviral infection.The dosage administered obviously depends on the activity of the active compound and also on the speed with which it is absorbed into the body and on other well known pharmacological considerations however it is recommended that the active compound is administered at from 2 jug to 10mg kg of animal body weight per day, preferably from 25g to lmg kg day and most preferably about 0.1 to 0.3mg kg day. The active compound may be administered once or severaltimes daily to achieve the required daily dose.

EXAMPLE 25Assay of activity of compounds of formula I Activity may be detected by the plaque inhibition PI test and measured by the plaque reduction PR test. Both assays involve the formation of a monolayer cell culture in a petri dish followed by infection with a virus suspension, and then overlaying the culture with nutrient agarose in the form of a gel. This gel ensures that there is no spread of virus throughout the culture and thus areas of localised cell destruction or plaques are formed. In the plaque inhibition test a filter paper disc which holds 0.01 ml when impregnated with il solution of a compound is placed on top of the agarose gel. The compound may then diffuse throughout the gel so that its greatest concentration will be around the disc and its lowest concentration towards the periphery of the petri dish. The efficacy of the compound may be detected by observing the zone of inhibition of plaque formation. Detectable activity is measured with the plaque reduction assay. A range of concentrations of compounds of known molarity are incorporated in the nutrient agarose overlay. Plaque suppression is proportional to compound concentration.Plaque numbers are expressed as percentages of a control, and a dose response curve may be drawn. From this curve 50 of the effective dose ED50 may be estimated.RESULTSCompound ofExample No. PR ED50 M 1 0.17 2 1.20 3 0.72 4 1.90 5.0 5 0.47 6 0.66 1.7 7 0.22 8 0.56 9 1.60 10 1.60 11 0.33 12 0.068 13 1.30 14 0.66 15 0.235 16 0.19 17 1.20 18 1.35 19 1.50 20 2.5 21 0.60 22 0.43 23 0.53 24 3.00EXAMPLE 25Intranasal Administration Simulation in vitro Petri dishes were prepared, as for the plaque inhibition test and the confluer sheet of cells was covered with a layer of agarose gel.
