# MATRIX ADDRESSED SMECTIC LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE

## Abstract
A matrix addressed smectic liquid display device MASD comprises a smetic liquid crystal material confined between a pair of closely spaced apart substrates 16, 18 of transparent insulating material. A first array of spaced highly conductive row lines 30 is disposed on a transparent highly resistive thin film 32 deposited on the interior surface 34 of one of the substrates 16 . A second array of spaced column lines 26 is disposed on the interior surface 28 of the other substrate 18 . Circuit means 40, 48, 50, 52 are provided to drive both ends of selected row electrodes with a voltage source to cause heating of the area of the highly resistive transparent material between the selected row line and an adjacent row line which has a reference potential connected to both ends. The heating causes the adjacent liquid crystal material to change from the smectic to at least the nematic state. A source of image signals 42 is coupled 44, 46, 54 to the column lines 26 as the liquid crystal material is cooling to selectively produce a clear or scattered state in the liquid crystal material. The row lines 30 are sequentially energized in conjunction with the appropriate image data to produce a desired display image.
