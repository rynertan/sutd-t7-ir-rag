## Description
CHARGE STORAGE STRUCTURE FOR NONVOLATILE MEMORY Background of the InventionThis invention relates to a memory device comprising a charge storage structure built utilizing silicon rich technology.Floating gate storage FET devices are well known in the technology where a conductor, usually Si, is embedded in an insulator layer. Such memory elements store information and allow for information modification and erasure. Some floating gate devices have employed Si rich layers as conductors for charge injection enhancement, but cannot store discrete charges in the Si rich layers due to the presence of a conductive layer adjacent to theSi rich region.FET structure used for such memory elements is typified by U.S. Patent No. 3,649,884 which utilizes a field effect transistor provided with a gate assembly. The gate assembly therein comprises a sandwich of a layer of SiO2 with excess Si disposed between two insulating films of appropriate thickness for the entrapment of charge carriers in the silicon rich SiO2 layer. This triple layer is disposed between the gate electrode and the substrate. This device requires a o thin, 30 40 A, insulator on the bottom of theSi rich layer otherwise tunneling cannot occur. However, charge leakage problems occur due to the thinness of the insulator.Another example of an electrically alterable floating gate memory device is disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,253,106. A silicon rich oxide layer is disposed between the control gate and the floating gate.A difficulty in prior art floating gate systems using embedded conductors is charge leakage if the structure is defective. Since the conductor can be considered an entity, charge tends to leak off eventually resulting in complete discharge and loss of the stored information. It is of course desired to have a memory device programmed to retain the information over an extended period of time until reprogrammed without loss of charge.Another of the difficulties of such electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM devices is a need for significant amounts of chip area due to the floating gate structure. Summary of the InventionThis invention departs from the prior art by using a trap structure as the charge retention mechanism instead of a floating gate memory structure. The invention eliminates the problem of leakage since if a defect exists only traps that are locally affected will be depleted. The charge storage structure employed by this invention employsSi rich SiO2 which is effectively an insulator at low fields but a conductor at high fields, i.e., for programming the device. However, the Si richSiO2 used in the device of this invention provides traps to store charges.In accordance with the present invention, a new charge storage structure is defined which is classified as an intermediate between prior MNOS devices and prior floating gate devices. The storage structure comprises four layers disposed between two electrodes. The lower electrode is a Si substrate. The upper electrode is doped polysilicon or metal such as aluminium. Alternative oxide and Si rich oxide layers define the four layer structure. In accordance with the present invention, the upper Si rich layer acts as an enhanced Fowler Nordheim injector. The second, or middle, Si rich layer which is sandwiched between two oxide layers also acts as an injector at the high fields used for device programming.Importantly, this middle Si rich layer is capable of storing a positive or negative charge because the Si particles in the oxide matrix act as deep electron traps. The two oxide layers act as insulators to prevent leakage at normal device operating conditions.As will be set forth herein, this new charge storage structure may be used in a programmable device An appropriate circuit is similar to the circuit for a MNOS device, with theMNOS gate replaced by a structure in accordance with the present invention. However, the steps of programming, reading, and erasing are done in a manner corresponding to technology associated with MNOS cells.This invention will be described in greater detail by referring to the attached accompanying drawing and the description of the preferred embodiments which follow. Brief Description of the DrawingFigure 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of charge storage structure in accordance with the present invention andFigure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of an electrically erasable programmable read only memory utilizing the charge storage structure ofFigure 1. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsReferring now to Fig. 1, a schematic cross section of a charge storage structure of this invention is depicted. The structure essentially comprises four layers sandwiched between two electrodes.The lower layer 10 is a silicon substrate. The upper electrode 12 is doped polysilicon or a metallic conductor such as aluminium having shown schematically a metalization lead 14. Sandwiched between the substrate and the upper electrode is a four layer structure comprising two SiO2 layers 16 and 18 and two Si rich oxide layers 20 and 22.Si rich oxides are known, for example, DiMaria et al, Electrically Alterable Read Only Memory Using Si Rich SlO Injectors and a Floating Polycristal 2 line Silicon Storage Layer , J. Appl. Phys., 52, 4825 1981 . In accordance with the present invention, thickness of layers 16, 18, 20 and 22 is is in the range of 8 30nm 80 300A The thickness of each layer may vary as a function of fabrication parameters for optimizing a particular device to a particular application.The upper Si rich layer 20 acts as an enhancedFowler Nordheim injector See, Electron Emission in Intense Electric Fields , Proc. Roy. Soc. London 119, 173 1928 . By enhanced FowlerNordheim injection is meant that injection takes places at a lower applied field by virtue of the excess Si in the SiO2. The middle Si rich layer 22 is sandwiched between the sio, layers 16 and 18. It also acts as an injector but importantly is capable of storing a positive or negative charge. This phenomenon occurs because the Si particles in the oxide matrix, shown inFigure 1, act as deep traps. In accordance with the structure of Figure 1, two charge storage operations are perceived charging to a positive state and discharging to an approximately neutral state. These two charge storage operations occur as follows. a charging to a positive state A positive voltage is applied to the upper electrode 12. Electrons move from the storage layer 20 by Fowler Nordheim tunneling. The flatSi SiO2 interface which exists between layers 10 and 18 results in bad injection efficiency and therefore at this field no electrons are injected from the bottom surface 10. When the external voltage is removed, the middle Si rich layer 22 is positively charged. b discharging to an approximately neutral state A positive voltage is applied to the bottom electrode 10. Electrons are injected from the top injector 12 into the middle Si rich layer 22 until an approximately neutral state is achieved. Then, the field in the lower SiO2 layer 18 becomes as large as that in the upper Sio2 layer 16 so that the middle Si rich layer 22 begins to inject electrons into the Si substrate 10. This results in an approximately neutral state in the middleSi rich layer 22. As a variation of this technique of discharging to an approximately neutral state, the positive voltage on the bottom electrode 10 could be replaced by utilizing a negative voltage at the top electrode 12.Thus, in these two charge storage operations, it can be seen that the upper Si rich layer 20 acts as a Fowler Nordheim injector and the middleSi rich layer while also acting as an injector stores positive or negative charges. This basic structure can be utilized in the context of a memory cell.Fig. 2 shows the use of the charged storage structure of Figure 1 in the context of an electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM . As is well known, the EEPROM memory cell is a three gate structure, for example, as described in Lancaster et al, A 5 V Only EEPROM with Internal Programs Erase Control , 1983 IEEESolid State Circuits Conference, Digest of Technical Papers, pp. 164 165. Such memory cells typically use metal Si N SiO2 Si gates. These structures See, Sze, Physics of SemiconductorDevices , John Wiley, New York, 1981, pp. 496 506 are replaced with the charged storage structure of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2, theEEPROM structure utilizes the charge storage structure of Figure 1, that is SiO2 layers 16 and 18 with Si rich SiO2 layers 20 and 22. Electrode 14 coupling the doped polysilicon layer 12 forms a gate.EEPROM structure is constructed on a silicon substrate comprising typically a first layer io of n silicon haring deposited thereon a second layer 1O of silicon of an opposite conductivity type. By conventional semiconductor techniques, a source and drain region 24 and 26 are placed in the layer 10 . Appropriate electrodes 28 and 30 are used to provide contacts to the source and drain regions. It will be appreciated that the remaining portion of this FET structure is completed by havingpolycrystaline silicon gate layers32, on top of insulating layers 34, such as a thermal SiO 2 Appropriate leads 36 and 38 are used to make contact to the gates.If the structure is built on single crystalline Si, then the first oxide layer 18 can be obtained by conventional oxidation techniques The remaining three layers are then built by CVD.Erasing, programming and reading are done in a manner corresponding to known MNOS cells. The structure of Figure 2 has no charge in the storage layer in its erase state. The Si layer 10 below the storage gate is in depletion. In the programmed state with positive charge in the storage layer 2 , the Si layer 10 is in inversion i.e., with zero voltage in the gate .The EEPROM structure of Figure 2 offers better controllability than conventional MNOS devices. The injection efficiency of the charge storage structure can be adjusted by the Si content in theSi rich oxide layers 20 and 22. The amount of trapping in the storage layer 22 can be adjusted by its thickness and its Si content. It will be appreciated that the programming voltages required are functions of the thicknesses of the oxide layers.This invention is also advantageous over floating gate structures since it eliminates the requirement for ultrathin insulators. Also the problem of optimizing device switching speed as a function of charge retention common in floating gate structures is avoided due to the charge retention ability of the middle Si rich layer. The fabrication of the structure shown in Figure 2 can be done utilizing chemical vapor deposition CVD in a manner known for double electron injector structures. DiMaria et al, supra, identify such DEIS configurations, including an electrode and Si layer sandwich including two silicon rich dioxide layers separated by a single SiO2 layerManufacturing techniques of that 3 layer structure are applicable for the 4 layer structure. Efficiencies occur because the entire 4 layer structure can be fabricated in a single run by changing the gas mixtures at appropriate points in the run. While this invention has been described in the context of a storage gate for an EEPROM, it is apparent that it may be employed in other nonvolatile memories.
