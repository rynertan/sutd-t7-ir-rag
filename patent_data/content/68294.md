## Description
A new acaricldal compo it on proces es for t production and its use This invention relates to an acaricidal composition, to processes for its production and to its use. Mites and arachnids are not destroyed by the majority of insecticides currently used for plant protection purposes and, because of this, have increased, in numbers to an even greater extent in recent years.Accordingly there dsaserious need for selective acaricides Numerous chemical acaricides have been used for controlling mites. In many cases, however, they have to be applied in large doses to the infested plants and, as a result, can have toxic effects both on the plant and on the environment. It has now surprisingly been found that the quantity of acaricides per hectare of cultivated area required for contolling mites can be reduced by up to 40 60 and, in some dases, by up to 80 providing the acaricidally active substance or the mixture of several acaricidally active substances is used together with a phospholipide from the group comprising phosphatidyl choline, hydrogenated phosphatidyl cholines, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, N acyl phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl serine, lysolecithin and phosphatidyl glycerol or with a mixture of several such phospholipides in a ratio by weight of from 1 0.2 to 1 20 without any risk of damage or harm to the useful plants. In addition, the new mixtures show considerably better adhesion to the produce to be protected and, as a result, afford effective protection against mites over a longer period. In addition to an improvement in the economy of treatment, the reduction in the quantity of acaricide used lessens the risk of damage to the plants, for example by reducing the residue remaining in the plant, which also results in a considerable reduction in the waiting time. Finally, most of the phospholipides are natural and, in every case, non toxic products which, byvirtue of their nature and their properties, do not cause any pollution of the environ ment or have any adverse effect upon the waiting time.Some of the phospholipides are of course even used in foods. To produce the new acaricidal compositions, the acaricides are mixed with the phospholipides or mixture of phospholipides in a ratio by weight of from 1 0.2 to 1 20, preferably in a ratio by weight of from 1 0,5 to 1 10 and, more preferably, in a ratio by weight of from 1 1 to 1 5. The weight of the phospholipide s is based on substantially pure phospholipide. Suitable phospholipides are, for example, the commercially available phosphatidyl cholines or phosphatidyl choline mixtures, such as PhospholiponR25 25 of phosphatidyl choline, 25 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and 20 of phosphatidyl iflositol PhospholiponRS5 55 of phosphatidyl choline, 25 of.phosphatidyl ethanolamine and 2 of phosphatidyl inositol3PhospholipinR80 80 of phosphatidyl choline and 10 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine PhospholiponR100 96 of phosphatidyl choline3 PhosphoLiponR1OOH 96 of hydrogenated phosphatidyl choline PhospholiponR38 38 of phosphatidyl choline, 16 of N acetyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine 4 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine . It is particularly preferred to use natural phosphatidyl cholines which may be produced by the processes described in the following Patents DE PS No.1,047,597, DE PS No. 1,053,299, DE PS No. 1,617,679,DE PS No. 1,617,680, German Patent Applications DE OS Nos 30 47 048, 30 47 012 and 30 47 011. Suitable N acyl phosphatidyl ethanolamines are in particular those in which the acyl group emanates from saturated or olefinically unsaturated fatty acids containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, particularly from saturated fatty acids containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms or from saturated or mono olefinically unsaturated fatty acids containing 14, 16, 18 or 20 carbon atoms. The acaricide used may be virtually any acaricide, for example the known chemical acaricides from the following groups 1.

The compounds of formula II are known acaricides, such as 4,6 dinitro 2 cyclohexylphenol, 4 r 6 dinitro 2 cyclohexylphenol salts, 4 nitro 2 , 6 di tert butylphenol, 4,6 dinitro 2 1 methylheptyl phenyl crotonate dinocap , 4,6 dinitro 2 sec. butylphenyl ss,ss dimethyl acrylate binapacryl , ethyl 4, 6 dinitro 2 tert. butylphenyl carbonate, isopropyl 4,6 dinitro 2 sec. butylphenyl3 carbonate dinobuton .3. Compounds corresponding to the following general formulaEMI4.2 in whichX S, SO or S02, n O or 1 andR1 to Rg H, NO2, halogen, particularly C1 or F Rl R9 may be the same or different . The compounds corresponding to formula III are known acaricides, such as 2,4,5,4 tetrachlorodiphenyl sulfide tetrasul , diphenyl sulfone, 4 chlorodiphenyl sulfone, 2,4,5,4 tetrachlorodiphenyl sulfone tetradifon , 4 chlorophenyl 4 chlorobenzyl sulfide chlorbensid , 4 fluorophenyl 4 chlorobenzyl sulfide fluorobensid . Other known acaricides which may be used include, for example the following preparations quinoxaline 2 , 3 trithiocyclocarbonate thioquinox , 6 methylquinoxaline 2,3 dlthio cycl.carbonate chinomethionat , N methylcarbamic acid 4 methylmercapto 3,5 dimethylphenyl ester methiocarb , N 2 methyl 4 chlorophenyl N ,N dimethylformamidine chlordimeform ,N 3 methylaminocarboxy Nt,N dimethylformamidine formetanat , 2,4,5 trichlorophenylaza 4 chlorophenylsulfide chlorfensulfid , 4 chlorobenzene sulfonic acid chlorfenson . However, it is preferred to use dinoc, benapacryl, dinobuton, tetrasul, chlorbensid, tetradifon, propargit, chlorfenethol, dicofol, chlorbenzilat, chlorpropylat, brompropylat, chlordimefon, formetanat, chinomethioat or thiquinox. The individual acaricides may be used on their own or in combination with other acaricides or possibly even insecticides after the addition of phospholipides. The new acaricide phospholipide compositions may be used for example in the growing of fruit and vegetables, in horticulture, in viniculture and in hop fields, for example for controlling arachnids, such as Tetranychus urticae, Tetranychus telariust Panonychus ulmi,Panonychus citri, or the various Bryobia species of false arachnids , for example the various Brevipalpus species of soft skinned mites, such as Hemitarsonemus catus, Tarsonemus pallidus, or of gall mites, such as for example Phyllocoptruta oleivora and numerous species from the geni Eriophyes, Phyllocoptes, Aceria and Vasates. The new acaricidal compositions may be prepared as follows The phospholipide or phospholipides is are dissolved in organic solvents such as, for example, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, ethanol or methanol or mixtures of these solvents. The choice of the solvent or solvent mixture will depend upon the solubility of the acaricide used. The acaricide or the commercial product containing the acaricide is then dissolved in the phospholipse solution by heating. On completion of dissolution, the solvent is removed in vacuo while heating. The product thus obtained is converted into a suitable standard formulation by the addition of suitable auxiliaries such as, for example, fillers, vehicles, diluents, wetting agents, stabilisers, gelating agents, evaporation accelerators and extenders. The new acaricide compositions may also be prepared by mixing the acaricide or the commercial product containing the acaricide with the phospholipide s and any fillers and auxiliaries which may be necessary, dissolving or suspending the resulting mixture in an organic solvent and then removing the solvent. The mixture obtained is ready for use. In the case of acaricides which are soluble in water or in water alcohol mixtures, the acaricide is with advantage first dissolved in water or in a water alcohol mixture and the phospholipide or phospholipide mixtures processed to form a solution or emulsion by stirring or by the application of ultrasonic waves.The emulsifiers normally required may be added before or after this stirring operation. The emulsion or solution thus obtained is freed from the solvent mixture or water in the usual way, for example by distillation, spray drying or freeze drying. The resulting product may be used as such or after the addition of suitable auxiliaries. The product may even be re emulsified or re dissolved in water and used as a spray preparation. Examples of vehicles are talcum, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, lime or crushed rock. Other auxiliaries are, for example, surface active compounds, such as soaps. fatty acid salts , fatty alcohol sulfonates.Gelatin, casein, albumin, starch or me thyl cellulose may be used as stabilisers or protective colloids. The new acaricidal compositions may be used in liquid or solid form, for example as dusting powders, granulates, sprays, aerosols, emulsions or solutions.
