# MOUNTING MEANS FOR THE STRAINER OF A JUICE EXTRACTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A juice extracting device 10 in which a main rotatable drive shaft 18 has a reamer 20 attached to its upper end, and a strainer 24 positioned beneath the reamer is operably connected by a unique mounting assembly with the upper end of an outer tubular shaft 28 in concentric surrounding relation to the main shaft, an eccentric 30 on the main shaft operates through a driving connection to impart an oscilla tory or vibratory movement to the tubular shaft and the connected strainer 24 . The mounting assembly for the strainer 24 includes a central hub 58 providing for the passage of the main drive shaft 18 , and is further con formed to provide an inwardly tapered polygonal socket 66 which is adapted for the endwise reception of a tapered end projection 50 of the outer tubular shaft 28 into a seated connecting supporting relationship with the strainer hub 58 . Preferably, the outer end surface of the end projection and the bottom surface of the socket 66 , when seatingly connected, are spaced apart to facilitate removal of the strainer from the outer tubular shaft 28 .
