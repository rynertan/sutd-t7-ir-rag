# Processing of sodium chloride brines for chlor alkali membrane cells.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a new and novel brine system for use in electrolyzing salt to chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen in chlor alkali cells employing an ion exchange membrane and, more particularly, to the efficient use of brine as the raw material to be electrolyzed in chlor alkali membrane cells. This invention also relates to a process for the conversion of a diaphragm cell and evaporator plant to one employing membrane type cells while still utilizing the existing brine treatment and caustic evaporation equipment and the resultant plant installations.
