# Pressurized aeration tank for activated sludge process sewage treatment.

## Abstract
A pressurized aeration tank 1 is provided which comprises an inner barrel 19 arranged on the tank axis and an axial flow impeller 23 of optimum characteristics mounted therein, the inner barrel 19 and the outer barrel or body portion of the tank 1 being particularly proportioned and arranged relative to each other to define in the tank 1 a circuitous flow passage of minimal total resistance loss. With this tank 1 structure, a highly improved plant efficiency of BOD removal is readily obtainable with the use of concen trated activated sludge and aerobic microorganisms, mainly of the Opercularia group, in a specified range of tank pressure.
