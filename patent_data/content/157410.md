## Description
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a strongly basic anion exchange resin having imidazolium salts as a functional group. It further relates to the use of the said anion exchange resin for the making of a medicament effective in the lowering of the cholesterol level. It has already been known that an anion exchange resin is applicable as a so called anticholesteremic agent for lowering the blood cholesterol level U.S. Patent Nos. 3,499,960 and 3,780,171 and British Patent No. 929,391 and Japanese Patent Laid Open Application No. 10386 1978 . The mechanism that administration of an anion exchange resin could lower blood cholesterol may be considered as stated below. Namely, a basic anion exchange resin would adsorb and fix bile acids present in the intestine to prevent said bile acids from reabsorption and to promote conversion of cholesterol, which is equilibrated with bile acids in the liver, to bile acids, whereby blood cholesterol is lowered. The basic anion exchange resin, which has been hitherto applied as an anticholesteremic agent, is an ion exchange resin having aliphatic quarternary ammonium salts as functional groups U.S. Patent Nos. 3,499,960 and 3,780,171 . However, such an anion exchange resin has drawbacks of a large dosage 8 to 16 g day and difficulty in ingestion due to its low activity. Also, the anion exchange resin having aliphatic quarternary ammonium salts as functional groups can be prepared by reacting an aliphatic tertiary amine with a haloalkyl group introduced onto a cross linked polymer, but the resultant anion exchange resin bears an offensive characteristic aliphatic amine odor and could not be put into practical use as such. Then, decrease in such offensive odor has been attempted practically by coating the surface of said anion exchange resin, but increase in dosage should be unavoidable due to a reduced ion exchange capacity caused by surface coating. In order to solve these drawbacks, the present inventors had already developed an anticholesteremic agent using as a main component an anion exchange resin prepared by using imidazoles for forming an anion exchangeable group, as filed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Application No. 24310 1982. By said invention the prior difficulties are overcome, but there is still need for a far higher active product. The anion exchange resin of the prior invention is prepared by reacting a halomethyloxirane compound with an imidazole and then reacting the resultant modified imidazole with a polyfunctional epoxy compound. However, said modified imidazole is a mixture of imidazole, 1 1 or 1 2 adduct of imidazole and a halomethyloxirane compound, and an oligomer, and further is not separable so that the resultant anion exchange resin has a less content of the imidazolium salt capable of contributing to salt splitting power among basic exchangeable groups upon imidazole and, though a higher activity can be seen as compared with the prior product, a far more highly active product has been desired. An object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a strongly basic anion exchange resin having a higher adsorptivity of bile acids and no offensive odor, and the use of the said resin to make an improved medicament effective in the lowering of the cholesterol level. This object is accomplished by the provision of the aforementioned pharmaceutical composition which comprises a strongly basic anion exchange resin having imidazolium salts as a functional group, said resin being a copolymer of In the above formula I , as the alkyl group of 1 to 17 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned straight, branched or cyclic alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, undecyl and heptadecyl as the aryl group of 6 to 8 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned phenyl, tolyl and xylyl as the alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl and cyclopropyl as the halogen atom, there may be mentioned chlorine and bromine.

The molecular weight of the polymeric substance, which may constitute the strongly basic anion exchange resins as specified with these substituents, is not particularly critical as far as said polymeric substance is insoluble in water. Preferable strongly basic anion exchange resins of this invention are illustratively exemplified as shown in Table 1. The particle diameter of the strongly basic anion exchange resin is one which can be passed through a 50 mesh sieve Tyler and, in general, preferably of 0,289 to 0.044 50 to 325 mesh . The strongly basic anion exchange resin having imidazolium salts as functional groups according to this invention may be prepared according to the process as disclosed in the co pending Japanese Patent Application No. 28055 1983 for an improved process for preparing an anion exchange resin. More specifically, a halomethyloxirane compound is subjected to reaction with an imidazole to form a high molecular quarternary salt intermediate having imidazolium salts on a main chain and the resultant salt is resinified with a polyfunctional epoxy compound to produce the desired resin. They are represented by the following formula wherein X₁ is a halogen atom, particularly a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom and R₄ is as defined above. Illustrative examples of these compounds which may be used in combination include epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and β methylepichlorohydrin. They are represented by the following formula wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are as defined above.

The invention also refers to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a strongly basic anion exchange resin having imidazolium salts as functional groups, said resin being obtained by The reaction solvent may be any of those which would be inert to the above mentioned reaction components and do not prevent resinification with the polyfunctional epoxy compound, and water is particularly preferred for the preparation of a high molecular quarternary salt with a large molecular weight. The molar ratio is preferably 0.9 to 1.5 moles of the halomethyloxirane compound to 1 mole of the imidazole, more preferably 1 to 1.1 moles. The reaction temperature is usually 30 to 150 Also, it is preferred to add dropwise the halomethyloxirane compound, to the imidazole at 50 to 80 C and, after completion of the dropwise addition, to raise the temperature to 80 to 120 The reaction time is suitably 2 to 30 hours. According to the above reactions, there is obtained the high molecular quarternary salt I wherein Ar is and X is Haℓ. Further alkali treatment gives the salt I wherein Ar is As the alkali treatment agent, there may be mentioned for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH and KOH and an alkaline earth metal hydroxide such as Ca OH ₂.

The present strongly basic anion exchange resin having imidazolium salts as functional groups has a higher content of the imidazolium base contributing to salt splitting power, since the high molecular quarternary salt employed as a constituent component holds an extremely less contamination of a low molecular weight material as compared with the prior art product. Consequently, the resin shows a higher adsorption activity on bile acids, i.e., a stronger anti cholesteremic activity. Also, the resin is less colored and odorless so that it is a very useful medicine. The acute toxicity of the present strongly basic anion exchange resin will be explained below. A suspension of the resin in a 1 tragacanth gum solution as a dispersion medium was orally administered to ICR JCL strain mice and the LD₅₀ value was determined upon mortality after 1 week to show an LD₅₀ value of above 5 g kg. The dosage of the present pharmaceutical composition may be 0.5 to 10 g daily for adults, preferably 1 to 4 g, because of the higher activity as compared with the prior art product, and the pharmaceutical composition may usually be administered in 1 to 3 divided forms daily. Administration of the present pharmaceutical composition to humans, is normally in oral form.
