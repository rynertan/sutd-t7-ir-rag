# REHEATING OF PREFORMS WITH RADIO FREQUENCY ENERGY

## Abstract
This relates to the discovery that when polymer pre forms are reheated in the forming of polymer bottles by blow molding techniques, if the reheating is effected by the use of RF energy, there will be a heating of the interior wall portion of the preform to a higher temperature than that of the exterior wall portion with the result that, due to the requirement of greater stretching of the interior preform wall portion, a more effective stretching of the heated preform during the blow molding thereof occurs with a highly beneficial result including a more controlled stretching of the polymer and a material reduction of the recently discovered chain scission and laminating effect which exists in like bottles formed of like preforms using present commercial heating methods. The differential temperature gradient resulting from RF heating has particularly beneficial results when the polymer is PET.
