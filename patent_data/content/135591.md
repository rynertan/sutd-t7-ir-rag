# Method for determining superior lacquer adhesion properties of a tin free steel sheet.

## Abstract
Tin free steel plate with excellent paint adherability, which has a metallic chromium layer and a chromium oxide layer on a steel plate, said chromium oxide layer being controlled so that it has an value of 0.50 or more wherein stands for transmittance of infrared ab sorption spectra, as measured accorcing to Fourier trans form infrared spectroscopy, corresponding to an ol bond and l⁶⁶⁰ stands for transmittance corresponding to an oxo bond .
