# Producing printed circuits by conjoining metal powder images.

## Abstract
By the process of this invention, printed circuits are prepared containing an electrically conductive wiring trace from materials having adherent and non adherent surface areas, e.g., printed circuit substrates bearing an imaged photoadhesive layer. Onto the adherent surface areas of the material are applied ductile metal or alloy particles, and any excess particles are removed from the non adherent areas. The metallized areas are conjoined, e.g., with silicon carbide brush or rounded metal rod. The conjoined areas can be electrolessly plated, electroplated or soldered. Multilayer printed circuits can also be prepared by repeating these steps with additional layers of photoadhesive material adhered to underlying printed circuits.
