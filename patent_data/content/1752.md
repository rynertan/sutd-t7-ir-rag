# Resilient pivotal joint.

## Abstract
An improved pivot joint 10a has a rotatable and tiltable stud 12a . A rotational preload force is applied to the stud 12a by a bearing 16a which is circumferentially stressed in tension to apply a clamping force to the stud 12a . This clamping force resists rotation of the stud 12a relative to a housing 14a until a predetermined minimum rotational force is applied to the stud 12a . A tilting or sidewise preload force is applied to the stud 12a . A tilting or sidewise preload force is applied to the stud 12a by a resiliently compressible bushing 18a which is disposed between the bearing 16a and the housing 14a . Since the tilting preload force is applied to the stud 12a by the bushing 18a , the bearing 16a can be designed to provide an optimum rotational preload force without regard to tilting preload force design considerations. Similarly, the bushing 18a can be designed to provide optimum tilting preload forces without regard to design considerations influenced by the rotational preload forces. The pivot joint 10a is advantageously assembled by resiliently expanding the bearing 16a , moving the stud 12a into alignment with the bearing 16a then releasing the bearing 16a so that it contracts part way back to its initia condition. The diameter of the stud surface 26a engaged by the bearing 16a is large enough so that the bearing 16a cannot fully retract back to its initial condition. This results in tension stresses being set up in the bearing 16a so that it applies a clamping force against the stud 12a to hold it against rotation. The bearing 16a is provided with stop means 112 which limit sideward tilting movement of the stud 12a .
