# Methods of and apparatus for use in decoding digital data.

## Abstract
In a method of or apparatus for decoding incoming digital data which includes respective synchronizing codes and address codes associated with successive data blocks, the address codes comprising respective data block addres ses which increase by one from data block to data block, the incoming digital data is checked 2 to 5 to locate the positions of said synchronizing codes, successive address codes are checked 7 to 10 to ascertain if the block addresses increase by one from one address code to the next, and if the block address does increase by one from one address code to the next, the incoming digital data is aligned 11 to 13 using the synchronizing codes, for subsequent decoding of the data blocks.
