# Improvements relating to hydraulic control systems.

## Abstract
A control system for operating a double acting hydraulic ram or motor including a proportional meter out type direc tional control valve which meters the flow of fluid out of the load and, in association therewith, a combined flow and pres sure control valve in the return line from the load. The flow and pressure control valve is responsive to the pressure drop across the meter out orifice of the directional control valve such that return line flow is restricted at high pressure drops and the supply pressure to the load is increased at low pres sure drops whereby a substantially constant pressure drop across the meter out orifice is maintained irrespective of the size or direction of the load.
