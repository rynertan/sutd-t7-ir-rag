# Long liquid ring pumps and compressors.

## Abstract
A liquid ring vacuum pump or compressor with a long axial dimension whose rotor blades are notched intermediate to their ends as at 28, 30, 32 to define annular gaps. Post members 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74 having arcuate inlet and outlet openings, are secured to the casing and project inward radially towards the rotor hub into the annular gaps. In this way the buckets formed by the rotor blades are filled with fluid from both axial ends of each section, thus maintaining a high volumetric efficiency with relatively high ratios of axial length to the diameter of the pump.
