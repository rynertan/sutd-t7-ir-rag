According to the present invention, there are provided diphenyl ether compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is a haloalkyl group of 1 or 2 carbon atoms containing one or more fluorine or chlorine atoms X and Y are each independently hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, cyano, nitro, or trifluoromethyl, A is hydrogen, nitro, halogen, CH3, cyano, or trifluoromethyl and R2 is a OH, b OM wherein M is a cation, c OR3 wherein R3 is optionally substituted phenyl, alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl d NR4R5 wherein each of the groups R4 and R5 may be hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or phenyl, or e WHSo2R3, or NMSO R3 2 wherein M is a cation. The term halogen in the foregoing definition is intended to include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The haloalkyl group R may be for example an alkyl group of one or two carbon atoms. The halogen part of the haloalkyl group may comprise one or more fluorine or chlorine atoms. Examples of haloalkyl groups include CF3 , C1CF2, CF2H , CH3CF2 and CHF2CF2 . When X or Y or both is an alkyl group, it may be for example an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example a methyl group. When R2 is a group OM, the cation M may be a metal cation or an ammonium or substituted ammonium cation.Examples of metal cations include alkali metal cations for example sodium, potassium, lithium and alkaline earth metal cations, for example, calcium and magnesium. Examples of substituted ammonium cations include mono , di , tri and tetra alkyl ammonium cations in which the one, two, three or four alkyl groups may each be of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and may optionally be substituted by one or more hydroxy or phenyl groups. The group R3 may for example be an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkenyl or alkynyl group of 2 to 6 or more carbon atoms. Examples of substituents which may be present when R is a substituted phenyl, alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group include halogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano, carboxy, COOM, alkoxycarbonyl e.g. alkoxycarbonyl containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms , amino, mono and dialkylamino wherein the alkyl groups have for example 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkylthio e.g. alkylthio of 1 to 6 carbon atoms , alkoxy e.g. alkoxy of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and phenyl.

For some compounds within the scope of the formula I it may be possible in principle for tautomeric forms of the compound to exist, in which a hydrogen atom may be transposed from one position to another within the molecule, the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecule being consequently rearranged.The structural formula I is intended to represent and to include such tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist.Where a compound falling within the scope of formula I is capable of existing in optically isomeric forms, the present invention includes the separate D and L forms of the compounds as well as mixtures of the D and L forms in all proportions. As normally prepared by chemical synthesis such optically isomeric compounds will be obtained as mixtures of equal proportions of the D and L forms i.e. racemic mixtures . The invention further provides processes for preparing compounds of formula I above. One such process is outlined in Scheme A below Scheme AEMI5.1 tb SEP OH SEP NO SEP X SEP COR2 tb SEP xY SEP COR2 tb X SEP V SEP Y SEP S SEP H SEP Base tb a SEP tb SEP R6 SEP F SEP removal SEP of SEP R6 SEP Y tb SEP I SEP III tb SEP x SEP COR2 tb b SEP III SEP SEP R1C1 SEP SEP Catalyst SEP R1 SEP 4 SEP SEP W SEP 2 tb SEP Y tb SEP Iv tb According to Scheme A, a suitably substituted hydroquinone in which R6 is H if X and Y are both hydrogen or a protecting group e.g. methyl if X or Y is not hydrogen is reacted with a 5 fluoro 2 itrobenzoic derivative II in the presence of a base to give the hydroxy diphenyl ether derivative III . The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent or diluent which is inert towards the reactants such solvents include liquid hydrocarbons, ketones, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, and N methylpyrrolidone. The reaction is preferably carried out with exclusion of atmospheric oxygen since hydroquinone is susceptible to oxidation. The base used in the reaction may be, for example, an alkali metal carbonate e.g. anhydrous K2CO3 or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide e.g. Ca OH 2 . The amount of base will depend on the nature of the group R2.When this is an OH or NHSO2R3 group, for example, two molar equivalents of base will be required. When R2is an OM group, for example, only one molar equivalent will be required. A possible side reaction in stage a of the process when hydroquinone itself is used is the reaction of both of the hydroxy groups of the hydroquinone molecule with the 5fluoro 2 nitrobenzoic derivative II . The use of calcium hydroxide as a base tends to reduce this side reaction. When a substituted hydroquinone is used the protecting group R6 is removed before stage b . In stage b of the process a metal salt of the hydroxydiphenyl ether III is reacted with an appropriate halogenoalkane to give a diphenyl ether IV according to the invention. The metal salt may be for example, a sodium or potassium salt, and may conveniently be prepared by dissolving the hydroxydiphenyl ether III in an aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction with the halogenoalkane may conveniently be carried out in a solvent comprising a mixture of water and an organic solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran. Preferably a phase transfer catalyst is also present in the reaction mixture, for example cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. The reaction is preferably accelerated by heating, for example to the reflux temperature of the mixture.The halogenoalkanes are highly volatile liquids and in order to retain them in the reaction flask it is necessary to use a condenser cooled with a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and a solvent erg. acetone . Alternatively, the reaction may be condueted in a sealed vessel. When using an open reaction vessel, reaction tends to be rather slow and may take several days to reach its maximum extent. The diphenyl ether derivative IV prepared as described above may be converted into other diphenyl ether derivatives according to the invention by standard chemical procedures. Thus, when IV is an ester, it may be hydrolysed to the corresponding carboxylic acid by, for example, treatment with a mineral acid.The carboxylic acid IV, R2 OH may then be converted to the corresponding acid chloride which can be reacted with amines R4R5NH to prepare amides, with sulphonamides R3S02NH2 to prepare N alkane sulphonamides, or with other alcohols to prepare further esters of the carboxylic aci IV, R2 0H .

N bromo or N chloro succinimide. The Xsubstituted phenyl ether V so obtained is then treated in acid solution with nitrous acid to form the corresponding diazonium salt. This is then decomposed by heating to give the phenol VI . In stage c the phenol VI is treated with a 5 fluoro 2 nitrobenzoic derivative in the presence of base to give the X substituted diphenyl ether VII . The p amino phenyl ether V required as starting material for stage a of Scheme B may be prepared by a variety of methods. Thus, for example, p aminophenol may be reacted with a halide R1Cl in the presence of a base, or with a halogenoalkene e.g. tetrafluoroethylene . In the case where R1 is to be CF3, the p aminophenol may be reacted with a mixture of CC14 and HF.

By way of example, in the case when A is hydrogen and R2 is OH, a typical procedure comprises first preparing the di salt of 3 hydroxybenzoic acid by adding the stoichiometric amount of a methanol solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide to a methanol solution of 3 hydroxybenzoic acid and then removing the solvent. The remaining di sodium or di potassium salt is then taken up in an aprotic solvent, preferably a polar aprotic solvent e.g. dimethyl formamide or dimethyl sulphoxide and heated with the compound IX . The reaction temperature is not critical the reaction may for example be carried out at temperatures in the range from 100 180 C. The free acid X can be obtained at the end of the reaction by treating the reaction mixture with an excess of a strong mineral acid. One convenient way to isolate the acid X is to pour the cooled reaction mixture into water, extract the mixture with a water immiscible organic solvent e.g. chloroform or toluene to remove unreacted starting material IX and the reaction solvent, and then acidify the aqueous solution to precipitate the acid X . The starting material IX may be prepared by reaction of a 3,4,5 X,Z,Y substituted phenol with a halogenoalkane R1C1 or with a halogenoalkene in the same way as described above for the preparation of the p amino phenyl ether V . Scheme C shows the substituent A as being present in the 3 hydroxybenzoic acid derivative which is reacted with the compound IX. However, if desired, when A is a substituent other than hydrogen, it may be introduced, by reaction of the diphenyl ether X wherein A is hydrogen with the appropriate electrophilic reagent. Thus, where A is to be a nitro group, the diphenyl ether is treated with a nitrating agent, for example Åa mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids or potassium nitrate sulphuric acid. sphere A is to be chlorine, the diphenyl ether X may be dissolved in a solvent e.g. glacial acetic acid and treated for example with gaseous chlorine. Examples of starting materials II for use in SchemeA include the following Methyl 5 fluoro 2 nitrobenzoate N methanesulphonyl 5 fluoro 2 nitrobenzamideExamples of starting materials V for use in Scheme B include the following 4 Amino chlorodifluoromethoxy benzene 4 Amino trifluoromethoxy benzene 4 Amino difluoromethoxy benzene 4 Amino 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzene Examples of starting materials IX for use in Scheme C include the following 3, 5 dichloro 4 fluoro chlorodifluoromethoxy benzene 3,5 dichloro 4 fluoro trifluoromethoxy benzene 3, 5 dichloro 4 fluoro difluoromethoxy benzene 3 chloro 4 nitro trifluoromethoxy benzene 3 chloro 4 nitro chlorodifluoromethoxy benzene The compounds of the invention are useful as herbicides. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a process of inhibiting the growth of unwanted plants, which comprises applying to the plants, or to the locus thereof, a phytotoxic amount of a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined. The amount of the compound to be applied in the process may vary, depending upon the particular compound chosen, and the identity of the plant species whose growth is to be inhibited, but in general amounts from 0.5 to 10 kilograms per hectare will be suitable in many cases from 3 to 5 kilograms per hectare will be appropriate. The skilled worker in the herbicide art will readily be able to establish appropriate application rates by standard procedures without undue experimentation. The compounds of the invention are effective in controlling a variety of unwanted plants in particular, they may be used to control species of the plant genusCyperus, which many existing herbicides fail to control.The compounds may be applied to the above ground parts of unwanted plants post emergence application or they may be applied to the soil to prevent the growth of plants from seeds present in the soil pre emergence application .In general the compounds are more effective when used as pre emergence treatments. The compounds used in the process of the invention are preferably applied in the form of a composition, in which the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. In another aspect, therefore, the invention provides a herbicidal composition, comprising as an active ingredient a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined, in admixture with a solid or liquid diluent. Preferably the composition also comprises a surface active agent. The solid compositions of the invention may be for example, in the form of dusting powders, or may take the form of granules. Suitable solid diluents include, for example, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, and Fuller s earth. Solid compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains comprising in addition to the active ingredient, a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion of the powder or grains in liquids. Such powders or grains may include fillers, suspending agents and the like. Liquid compositions include aqueous solutions, dispersions and emulsions containing the active ingredient preferably in the presence of one or more surface active agents. Water or organic liquids may be used to prepare solutions, dispersions, or emulsions of the active ingredient. The liquid compositions of the invention may also contain one or more corrosion inhibitors for example lauryl isoquinolinium bromide. Surface active agents may be of the cationic, anionic or non ionic type. Suitable agents of the cationic type include for example quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable agents of the anionic type include for example soaps, salts of aliphatic mono esters of sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example dodecyl benzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium and ammonium ligno sulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropyl .naph thalenesulphonic acid.Suitable agents of the non ionic type include, for example, the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octylphenol, nonylphenol, and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitol monolauratet the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide and the lecithins. The compositions which are to be used in the form of aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being diluted with water before use. These concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage to be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The compositions of the invention may contain, in addition to carriers and surface active agents, various other constituents to increase their usefulness. They may contain, for example, buffering salts to maintain the pH of the composition within a desired range antifreeze agents, for example urea or propylene glycol adjuvants, for example, oils and humectants and sequestrants, for example citric acid and ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, which help to prevent the formation of insoluble precipitates when the compositions are diluted with hard water. Aqueous dispersions may contain anti settling agents and anti caking agents. The compositions may in general contain a dye or pigment to impart a characteristic colour. Agents for increasing viscosity may be added to reduce the formation of fine droplets during spraying, and thereby reduce spray drift. Other additives useful for particular purposes will be known to those skilled in the formulation art. In general concentrates may conveniently contain from 10 to 85 and preferably from 25 to 608 by weight of active ingredient. Dilute preparations ready for use may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient, depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used however, dilute preparations suitable for many uses contain between 0.01 and 10 and preferably between 0.1 and 1 by weight of the active ingredient.
