# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO DRIVER CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A static noninverting driver circuit B is used with a standard static address row decoder circuit A in order to provide capacitance load drive capability and relatively high speed operation. The driver circuit uses n channel enhancement T15, T18, T19, T22, T23 and depletion mode 1 T16, T17, T20, T24 field effect transistors and a feedback bootstrap capacitor T25 to achieve low power high speed operation with a full VDD output high level.
