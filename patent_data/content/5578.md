# Wagon capable of traveling on a railway and on the ground.

## Abstract
A wagon capable of traveling on a railway and on the ground, consisting of a chassis on which, near the front and rear ends, wheels are mounted for traveling on a railway, and parallel thereto, wheels for traveling on the ground. The wheels for traveling on the ground being offset from the pivot of the truck in a direction perpendicular to the axles and the wheels for traveling on a railway being mounted in a linkage attached to the truck near one end thereof, the other end connecting with a locking means brought into engagement by the swing of the linkage with at least one receiving member attached to the chassis, so that a truck may be fixed in one or more positions. Because the wheels are mounted in trucks, the wagon can readily negotiate sharp curves in the railway, and because the ground wheels are offset from the pivot of the truck, a sort of swivel is formed, so that in traveling on the ground, the swivels will always caster to the rear in relation to the direction of travel.

## Description
WAGON CAPABLE OF TRAVELING ON A RAILWAY AND ON THE GROUND The invention relate to a wagon capable of traveling on a railway and on the ground, consisting of a chassis on which, near the front and rear ends, wheels are mounted for traveling on a railway, and parallel thereto, wheels for traveling on the ground. Wagons of this type may be used in operations where it is necessary or desirable to transport goods or products by a railway and then on the ground or vice versa. In particular, such wagons are suitable for gardening purposes where products are grown over large areas and must be transported over comparatively long distances, while the avenues of transport must occupy as little space as possible and require frequent re routing. The object of the invention is to provide a wagon of the kind above mentioned, simple in construction and highly maneuverable, both as a rail car and in traveling on the ground. This object is accomplished in that, in the wagon according to the invention, the wheels are mounted on trucks, the wheels for traveling on the ground being offset from the pivot of the truck in a direction perpendicular to the axles and the wheels for traveling on a railway being mounted in a linkage attached to the truck near one end thereof, the other end connecting with a locking means brought into engagement by the swing of the linkage with at least one receiving member attached to the chas sis, so that a truck may be fixed in one or more positions. Because the wheels are mounted in trucks, the wagon can readily negotiate sharp curves in the railway, and because the ground wheels are offset from the pivot of the truck, a sort of swivel is formed, so that in traveling on the ground, the swivels will always caster to the rear in relation to the direction of travel, while at least one of the trucks is locked because the linkages are so swung by the weight of the rail wheels, now hanging clear, that the locking means are moved into the position in which they can enter into engagement with the corresponding receiving members. Preferably each receiving member is so arranged that the corresponding locking means can enter into engagement with it when the corresponding ground wheels are directed inward in relation to the pivot of the truck. In this way, in the direction of travel, the front truck is locked while the rear truck remains free to swing in traveling on the ground. Between the linkage and the truck, a spring may be arranged, causing the linkage to swing in the direction in which the locking means can enter into engagement with the receiving member. Preferably the locking means consists of a bolt and the receiving member of an opening capable of receiving the bolt. If it is desired to provide means of releasing a locked truck, the opening may be arranged in a member mounted on the chassis and capable of swinging upward. Preferably only one rail wheel is mounted in each truck, with a ground wheel on either side of it, so tlijt a ionorjiJ ji is obtained. The rail wheel may then have a concave thread, so that pipe can be used for the rail, for example a plastic pipe, possibly flexible, conveniently laid loose on the ground. Near the top of the rail wheel, a plate may be fixed to the chassis, projecting into the tread outline with some clearance. Such a plate will keep the rail wheel clean so that it will follow the rail dependably. The invention will now be illustrated in more detail with reference to the drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a wagon according to the invention in side view, Fig. 2 shows a side view, to a larger scale, of one of the trucks of the wagon according to Fig. 1, with the wheels omitted for the sake of clarity, Fig. 3 shows a section at the line Ill Ill in Fig. 2, and Fig. 4 shows a section at the line IV IV in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 1, the wagon comprises a chassis 1 with some sort of superstructure 2. To the chassis 1, at the front and rear ends of the car, box like housings 3 and 4 are mounted, a truck 5 and 6 being arranged rotatable on a vertical axis in each housing. Each truck comprises a rail wheel 7 and two ground wheels 8 placed on either side of it. As shown in Fig. 1, the rail wheels 7 of the wagon are resting on a single rail 9 consisting of pipe, so that the wagon can be propelled along the rail. At one end of the single rail 9, the wagon can be run off the rail, whereupon the ground wheels 8 come into contact with the ground and the wagon can travel over the ground on the ground wheels 8.Since, as shown in Fig. 1, the ground wheels 8 are offset relative to the pivots of the trucks 5 and 6 respectively, the ground wheels 8 will always swing into the position shown in Fig. 1 relative to the direction of travel, which is to the left in the figure. Then, by means more specifically described below, the front truck 5 is automatically locked, while the rear truck 6 remains freely pivoted, so that the wagon will be duly movable and maneuverable in traveling on the ground. As shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, each truck 5, 6 comprises a fork assembly 10, mounted in the box 3 or 4 by means of a ball bearing 11. Outside of the fork assembly 10, two journals 12 are fixed, off set from the pivot of the truck. On these journals 12, the ground wheels 8, provided with rubber tires 15, are mounted by means of ball bearings 13. In addition, by pivots 16, an auxiliary fork 17 is attached to the fork assembly 10, such auxiliary fork being capable of swinging on pivots 16. At one end of the auxiliary fork 17, a shaft 18 is secured, passing through oblong holes 19 in the fork assembly 10, on which in turn the rail wheel 7 is mounted by means of a ball bearing 20. The rail wheel 7 has a concave tread 22 so that the rail can partially envelope the tubular monorail 9. The fork assembly 10 has a stripper plate 23 welded to it, to clear the tread 22 of any dirt that may have been picked up by the rail wheel 7. The other end of the auxiliary fork 17 is connected to the bolt 24 passing through an opening in plate 25. By swinging the auxiliary fork 17 upward, the bolt 24 can be made to project upward from the opening in the plate 25 and is received in the opening 26 of a receiving member 27 mounted on the housing 3 or 4 and capable of swinging upward. A tension spring 28 is arranged between the auxiliary fork 17 and the fork assembly 10. Now when the wagon is run off the monorail 9, the weight of the rail wheels 7, now freely suspended, and the action of the spring 28, swing the auxiliary fork 17 so that the bolt 24 can drop into the opening 26. Depending on the position of the truck, the truck will then be locked. As soon as the wagon is again to serve as a rail vehicle, so that the two rail wheels will again assume the load, a slight rotation of the fork assembly 10 will release the lock, whereupon both trucks are again free to rotate, as is required in order to follow the rail 9 properly. If it is desired to effect the release earlier, the rotatable receiving member 27 may be lifted.
