# PARALLEL DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A parallel data processing system comprising a control means 3 1 , a plurality of processing means 3 2 controlled by said control means and adapted to perform parallel data processing, memory means provided correspondingly to said processing means and adapted to store data for corresponding processing means, and ring bus means 3 3 connecting said memory means in a ring configuration so that data is shifted along the ring bus. Each of the processing means performs data processing based on data transferred to the corresponding memory means.
