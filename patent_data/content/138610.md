# Electron detector.

## Abstract
Secondary electrons emitted by a body under electron beam bombardment into the magnetic field of a magnetic elec tron lens in which the body is placed are constrained and direct ed by the magnetic field so that the lens either focusses them to a small region at the centre of a hemispherical collector as sembly so that the direction of the electrons do not affect their angle of incidence on the collector, or brings their paths to be within a small angle 5 of the axis of the lens so that they im pinge on a plane collector substantially normally. The invention is of particular value in the electron beam inspection of an inte grated circuit when operating.
