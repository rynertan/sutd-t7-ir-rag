# A milk preparation suitable for diabetics and lactose intolerant persons, and a process for preparing it.

## Abstract
A milk preparation suitable for persons suffering from diabetes or lactose intolerance contains fructose or aspartame in place of the lactose of the milk. Such milk preparations may be prepared by separating lactose from the milk by ultrafiltration or by a chromatographic treatment, and then adding fructose or aspartame. Vitamins and minerals are also added to ultrafiltered milk.

## Claims

## Description
A MILK PREPARATION SUITABLE FOR DIABETICS AND LACTOSE INTOLERANT PERSONS, AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING IT The invention relates to milk preparations suitable for persons suffering from diabetes or lactose intolerance, and to their preparation. Owing to its high lactose content ca 5.0 , ordinary milk is not suitable for persons suffering from diabetes. Because of its rapid absorption, lactose is to diabetics almost as harmful as saccharose sucrose . For this reason, diabetics often have to abstain completely from milk.It is known that, for persons suffering from lactose intolerance or galactosemia, low lactose milk has been prepared by ultrafiltering milk to a low lactose content and by adding minerals in the form of salts and carbohydrates, in the form of saccharose Domagk, G.F. Milchwissenschaft 36 10 p. 603 604 1981 or of maltodextrin Sorensen, K.L.,Meersohn, M.V., Sonne , J., Larsen, L., and Gudmand Heyer, E., in Milk Intolerances and Rejection ed. J. Delmont , Karger,Basle 1983, pp. 63 65. However, because of the rapid absorption of the glucose of the carbohydrates, a product thus prepared is not suitable for diabetics. The present invention provides a milk preparation which is suitable for diabetics and lactose intolerant persons and which, in addition, has a good taste and feels pleasant in the mouth. The composition of the milk preparation of the invention substantially corresponds to that of ordinary milk except that it contains little or no lactose and that.it contains fructose and or N L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester aspartame as a sweetener. Preferably the milk preparation contains 0.5 1.5 g of fructose per 100 g of milk preparation, or 5 15 mg of aspartame per 100 g of milk preparation. As used herein the term ordinary milk means primarily non fat, lowfat or whole milk. According to a feature of the present invention the milk preparation described above is prepared by ultrafiltering ordinary milk so that the lactose concentration drops to less than 10 of the dry matter content, and then replacing the lactose removed either by fructose which is absorbed slowly, and or by aspartame. Alternatively, the lactose may be separated chromatographically from the milk in accordance with Finnish Patent Application 854485, and then replaced by fructose and or by aspartame. In the case of ultrafiltered milk the separated minerals and vitamins are returned to the product in the form of separate compounds or as a saltvitamin mixture, and water is added to the product so that its protein content corresponds to that of ordinary milk, while the lactose content of the final product is less than 20 of the original lactose content.On the other hand, chromatographically separated milk contains the original minerals and vitamins, and so they need not be added. Preparations intended for diabetics often have a taste clearly different from that of the original product.For example, the hydrolysed milk intended for lactoseintolerant persons is often regarded as being too sweet. The preparation according to the invention has the advantage that, not only in its nutritional quality, but also in taste, it substantially corresponds to milk.The invention is described below in greater detail in theExamples. Example 1 Non fat milk is ultrafiltered so that its dry matter content increases to 27 Brix and its protein content to 17.5 . Fructose 0.043 parts by weight and water 4.26 parts by weight are added to the concentrate 1 part by weight u dSEicK, 100 g NaCl, 5 g Na3 citrate, ZOO g K3 citrate, 120 g K2HPO4. 3H20, 40 g MgCl2. 6H20, 22 g CaCl2 2 H20, 0.004 g MnS04. H2 0, and 0.012 g thiamine are added per 100 litres of the mixture. The mixture is pasteurized and packed into plastic bottles. The milk thus obtained has a taste resembling that of non fat milk. It contains protein 3.2 g 100 g, but only 1.7 g 100g of carbohydrates. With respect to minerals the composition of the preparation obtained is also similar to that of non fat milk Table 1 .Table 1 Low lactose milk Ordinary according to the non fat invention milk energy kcal 100 g 20 33 protein 3.2 3.2 fat 0.05 0.05 carbohydrates 1.7 5.0 of which lactose 0.9 5.0 fructose 0.8 ash 0.77 0.76Na mg 100 g 60 60K mg 100 g 170 170Ca mg 100 g 120 120P mg 100 g 80 80Mg mg 100 g 10 10Cu mg 100 g 0.01 0.01Mn mg 100 g 0.01 0.01Fe mg 100 g 0.04 0.04Zn mg 100 g 0.4 0.4Cl mg 100 g 110 100 thiamine mg 100 g 0.03 0.03 riboflavin mg 100 g 0.20 0.20Example 2 A column having a height of 100 cm and a diameter of 1.6 cm was filled with a strong cation exchange resin produced by Suomen Sokeri Oy. The average particle size of the resin was 0.4 mm. The resin volume of the packed column was 160 ml. The column had a heating mantle by means of which the temperature was maintained at 650C.Two litres of non fat milk was first pumped through the column in order to reach an ionic equilibrium. After a rinse with water, 5 ml non fat milk concentrate dry matter content approx. 30 wasfed into the column. Demineralized water was used for the elution. The flow rate was 150 ml h. Table 2 shows the composition of the lactose free fraction of the treated milk, compared with the composition of non fat milk.

The addition rate is 0.5 1.5 g 100 g.Example 3A non fat milk preparation suitable for use by diabetics was prepared by ultrafiltration as in Example 1, butN L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester aspartame 8.5 mg 100 g was added instead of fructose, to attain the original sweetness of the milk.
