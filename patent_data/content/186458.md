## Description
Timber branding This invention relates to the branding of timber and is related especially, but not exclusively to the branding of freshly sawn timber. The term branding means the marking of timber with identification symbols relating to the type or quality grade of the timber. After the timber has been felled it is normal to rough saw the green timber before it is dried. The green timber has a high moisture content e.g. greater than 100 for softwoods and up to 150 for hardwoods and must be dried before use. usually outdoors or in a kiln. Green timber is particularly difficult to brand on account of the high water content. Moreover hardwood is generally wetted during sauing as the saw blade often has to be cooled with a water spray. Existing methods of branding freshly sawn timber involve the use of various types of ink which provide neither distinctly legible grades of mark nor marks which can be maintained on the timber for a sufficient length of time.particularly in view of the rigorous conditions under which sawn timber is transported. stored and worked. In particular, the branding must show satisfactory water resistance for storage outdoors. As timber is quickly passed out of the saw mill the brand must also be capable of drying within a short time. Typically less than 5 to 10 minutes.The branding fluid must also be economical and compatible with existing equipment. It is an object of the present invention to mitigate these disadvantages associated with known methods of branding timber. It has now been discovered that excellent branding may be achieved by applying an iron salt to the timber so as to generate in situ a blue black stain produced by the reaction of the iron with polyphenols e.g. tannins in the wood. The staining of wood with iron has been known for a long time and dyes for timber have been proposed on the basis of this reaction for example, Canadian patent specification 854676 . The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that under certain necessary conditions, the reaction lay be utilised to fulfill the requirements of a branding system. In particular the present invention provides a method of branding sawn timber which comprises applying to a surface of the sawn timber a branding fluid comprising an aqueous solution of Fe111 ions and an acid to render the solution acidic. so as to brand the timber surface with identification symbols. The ferric ions react with the polyphenols present in the wood to give a blue black colour or precipitate of complex chemical structure. Under acid conditions the reaction occurs rapidly enough to be suitable for branding and the acid is in fact very compatible with existing equipment. keeping it clean and preventing clogging. Once dried. the brand shows good water resistance. The ferric ions are preferably in the form of ferric chloride. ferric nitrate or a mixture thereof. It has been found that particularly good results may be obtained using a branding fluid which aiso includes a suspension of iron oxides which seem to give a clearer brand possibly by promoting the reaction between the ferric ions and the polyphenols and or by acting as a pigment. This may be produced by dissolving iron in a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids. The acids will generally. each be present in an amount of 2 to 10 wt vol so as to dissolve the iron and produce an acid solution. Preferably the hydrochloric and nitric acids are present in the ratio of 2 1 to 1 2 by weight. The iron oxides are believed to be a mixture of various hydrated iron oxides such as FeO. Pre20, Fe203 and Fe 304 The suspension reacts rapidly with the polyphenols. Preferably, the total iron content of the branding fluid is in a weight ratio of 2 to 10t, for example 3 to 7 . Generally the pH of the branding fluid is less than 5, preferably less than 4 and advantageously 1 to 3. The method is particularly useful for green timber. which has been rough sawn prior to drying. It is particularly useful for hardwood but also gives good results with softwoods. Typical hardwoods include blackbutt, turpentine. array and karri. Typical softwoods include radiata pine.cypress pine and douglas fir. Hardwoods usually have a high polyphenol content. but surprisingly the method also works well with timber such as brushbox which has a very low polyphenol content. However. with timber having a low polyphenol content it is prefer ed to also include a dye such as Chromazurol S in the branding fluid to give a darker colour. Although it is not generally necessary, if the timber is to be immediately exposed to wet conditions. it may be desirable to cover the brand with a protective film of a clear film forming material e.g. polyvinyl chloride. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only. The Examples include solutions of ferrous ions and alkaline solutions also for comparison purposes.Example 1 In tests carried out in this first Example. a range of iron compounds in various solutions or suspensions were used, a detailed description of the materials being provided inTable 1.

Both species of wood were freshly sawn into 100 x 50 x 120 mm samples. each capable of accommodating three markings per side. A standard rubber stamp of 40mm diameter was used for this purpose. Equal quantities of each solution shown in Table 1 were poured over a piece of clean felt placed within a separate plastics container. to eliminate any possible contamination with other chemicals. Then, all the samples were marked. There were three samples per species and chemical used.Each sample was treated differently First sample stamped only and assessed immediately Second sample stamped. hosed with water and assessed after two hours and Third sample stamped. exposed to weathering for two weeks and then assessed. The results are summarised in Table 2.

The markings of the first batch of samples were assessed at room temperature immediately after being stamped, whilst the samples of the second batch were sprayed with water and examined after two hours. The last batch of samples was stamped. weathered for a period of two weeks and then assessed. The qualitative assessment of the samples which were sprayed with water and or weathered in fairly severe atmospheric conditions for a considerable period of time, is important insofar as the selection of the most suitable fluid for marking freshly cut timber is concerned. It was observed that the effectiveness of all the fluids was greatly reduced, if fresh markings on the timber were subjected to an excess of water. Thus, all weathered samples were exposed to rainy conditions prevailing at the time of trial. The direct effect of this was a spread of stain, in some instances, resulting sometimes in an almost complete removal of the compound applied to the timber surfaces. An explanation is that, in a sufficient concentration, the iron and the polyphenolic substances in timber are able to interact and produce an irreversible reaction in the aqueous phase. This reaction is complete and irreversible only after a certain period of time. which is necessary for permanent branding of the timber. By adding excess water before permanent fixation of the brand occurs, efficiency of this chemical reaction is greatly decreased in conjunction with the reduction in concentration of both reactants. This indicates that after a proper chemical reaction has taken place. the most important parameter for qualitative assessment of samples becomes the resistance of the marking to an excess of water. To achieve a good quality brand, a fairly short stabilising fixation time of not more than 15 minutes, is preferably required. lt is, however. preferable not to rely on this extra time for stabilising the polyphenolic reaction and permanently fixing the marking. as in normal industrial practice, the marked timber is usually conveyed from a mill without delay.This problem of mark stabilisation, therefore. can be solved preferably by reducing this extra time to a minimum. Example 2 suggests that fluids 3A and 5A, and to a lesser extent fluid 5B, are suitable for marking green timber and were investigated further in a subsequent third Example to be discussed below. The results can be summarized as follows 1. Of the whole series of fluids used for chemically marking fresh, rough sawn hardwoods. two. namely, fluids 3A and SA, were found to be very acceptable. 2. Although the best was fluid 3A, it was still considered to be slightly inferior to fluid 3 of Example 1. 3. All the fluids were selected, tested and assessed on the basis of their resistance to water, a factor which was important for industrial application.Example 3 The two best fluids, namely, ferric nitrate and iron suspension. from Examples 1 and 2, were selected for assessment.

The wire was covered by 10 20ml of water. followed by lOml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, whilst heating gently in a water bath.After 15 minutes, a further 30ml of water were added and the heat removed. 15ml of concentrated nitric acid were then added very cautiously to the mixture. The reaction is vigorous and produces poisonous fumes of nitrogen dioxide, and consequently the entire procedure was carried out in a fume cupboard. The beaker was then placed on a water bath and heated. More water was added to ensure that the mixture did not dry out. The beaker was left on the water bath until all the wire had dissolved. the volume then being made up to 200ml. The fluid produced comprised a solution of ferric chloride and ferric nitrate with iron oxides suspended therein. The composition of the iron wire used for the manufacture of the suspension by weight was carbon 0.03 . sulphur 0.02 . manganese 0.04 , phosphorus 0.002 , silicon 0.001 t and iron 99.89 S. The iron wire could have been replaced effectively by the same amount of technical grade iron filings which are generally cheaper.Branding tests In this Example. two different weight volume ratios for each compound were used. Details of both compounds in different concentrations are provided in Table S. Freshly milled samples of the same two species used in previous Examples 1 and 2, namely. blackbutt and turpentine, were prepared. The size of these samples was somewhat larger than that used in the previous experiments. in order to accomodate a minimum of six and a maximum of eight markings per side. Two sides of each sample were marked and. in total, there were six samples branded per species and per compound of a different concentration. The method of sample marking in Example 3 was the same as that used in both previous Examples. The previous two Examples suggested that a severe weathering test could be considered as an indication as to whether a chemical compound used for marking or branding was sufficiently resistant to adverse conditions which are common in industrial practice. For this reason. subsequent assessment of results was based on weathered samples only. The results of the qualitative assessment of branding inExample 3 are provided in Table 6.

It was suggested, therefore. that a protective coating, applied immediately over fresh markings. might provide an improved result. Thus, half the samples used in Example 3 were treated with a commercially available VIKEM spray.capable of forming instantaneously a dialectically strong and durable vinyl film over each freshly branded sample of timber indicated as special in Table 6 . Qualitative assessment of all the samples was carried out after two weeks of exposure in harsh atmospheric conditions, characterised essentially by heavy and continuous rain fall.After this preliminary assessment, all the samples remained at the exposure site for the next four weeks, when they were re assessed. The results obtained in Example 3 indicate that the best fluid capable of reacting vigorously with polyphenolics in wood to produce a neat and durable mark of rough sawn timber, is fluid 3. The optimum volume weightratio is 5 .However, other fluids may be used when an excess of water is not present. The weathered samples. which were sprayed with the vinyl composition, were completely waterproof and visually looked better than those submitted to the normal treatment. It was observed that a short delay in spraying produced better results, those samples. which prior to exposure were kept for one hour under cover and then sprayed. being of extremely good quality. As far as the various timber species are concerned, it would appear that there is no significant difference in the quality of branding or marking. Indeed. the markings on both clear and dark woods used in Example 3 were equally well readable and of a good quality.ExamPle 4 Further tests were carried out upon the Australian hardwood with the lowest polyphenol content. namely, brushbox LoPhostemon confertus , using the iron solution 3 fromExamples 1 and 3 above. The results of these test provided very good marking qualities, of the order of 1 in the quality of marking scales in Tables 2, 4 and 6 above. Additional tests were also conducted upon two further hardwood Eucalyptus species. namely, jarrah Eucalvtus marvinata and karri EucaloPtus diversicolor . with excellent marking qualities of 1 from the Tables above. In both the further and additional tests upon brushbox, and jarrah and karri. the timber samples were freshly rough sawn. Similarly, yet further tests were conducted upon freshiy rough sawn samples of three softwoods, again with excellent marking results of the order of 1 in the Tables above. These three softwoods were Radiata pine Pinus radiata , Cypress pine Callitris columellaris and Douglas fir Pseudotsuaa menziesii . Thus, it can be seen that the branding method is effective in relation to both hardwoods and softwoods.
