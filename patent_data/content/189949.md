## Description
This invention relates to a reproduction device comprising means for transferring an image from a temporary image support to a sheet of receiving material, process functions, including imaging means the imaging ratio of which can be varied, for applying the image of an original to the temporary image support and means for feeding a sheet of receiving material to the transfer means, and control means for controlling the process functions. US patent specification 3 967 896 describes a copying device as indicated above, by means of which it is possible to make copies whose image free edge zones on the left and right of the copy side margins are changed so that the copies can thus be given a sufficiently wide fastening or binding edge at the left hand side. The occurrence of information loss as a result of the change of the width of image free edge zones can be obviated in these conditions by reproducing the image of the original to a somewhat reduced scale on the copy. The correct adjustments of the copying device can be found by the operator by making one or more sample copies. US patent specifications 4 162 844 and 4 187 024 describe similar copying devices suitable for making double sided copies duplex copies and having adjustment facilities to make the image free edge zones on the front and the reverse sides of the copy to coincide. With these devices too the operator has to determine the correct adjustments by making sample copies. The need to make sample copies is a disadvantage. Particularly when a reduction of the size of the image appears to be necessary to avoid loss of information on the copies, selection of the correct machine adjustments can be time consuming. The invention provides for a reproduction device according to the preamble, which is characterised in that means are provided with which it is possible to supply to the control means data concerning the width of each of two oppositely situated image free edge zones of an original which is to be reproduced and concerning the required minimum width of the corresponding edge zones on the sheet of receiving material, and in that the control means comprise means which by reference to the data supplied calculate the imaging ratio and an adjustment or an activation time of at least one of the process functions, in order to realize the required minimum width of the edge zones on the receiving material and which generate control signals to control the relevant process functions in accordance with the calculated values. Since the control means themselves determine the imaging ratio and the final width of the image free edge zones on the receiving material, the minimum requirements indicated by the operator being taken into account, the effect obtained according to the invention is that there is no need to make sample copies to determine the correct machine adjustments. A copying job can thus be carried out more quickly. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the control means comprise a memory in which the data concerning the minimum width to be realized for the image free edge zones can be permanently programmed. Consequently, the operator does not need to re input these data for each copying job. The memory is preferably a read write memory RAM , so that the operator can change the programmed data or have them changed by a service engineer. According to another embodiment of the invention, the reproduction device is also provided with means with which details concerning the dimensions of the original and the sheet of receiving material can be fed to the control means. In this way the width of the image free edge zones on the copy can be adjusted for any arbitrary size of the original and any arbitrary size of the receiving material, as required. The invention and other advantages thereof will be explained in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 diagrammatically represents an electrophotographic copying machine equipped with a recirculating original feed and discharge device consisting of a holder 1 with a sheet separating mechanism 2, a feed path 3, 4, a conveyor belt 5, the direction of transport of which is reversible, a return feed path 6, 7 and a reversing path formed by path section 6, roller 8 and path section 4. An original fed via feed path 3, 4 from the bottom of a stack of originals in holder 1 is conveyed on by conveyor belt 5 over the exposure window 9 to a bar 10 resting on the exposure window 9. After exposure the original, if it has an image on only one side, is returned via the return feed path 6, 7 to the top of the stack in the holder 1. If the original has an image on both sides, then after the first exposure it is conveyed through the reversing path 6, 8, 4, by means of which it is returned to the exposure window 9 in the reversed position. After the second exposure the original is then returned to the holder 1 via the return feed path 6, 7. The exposure device of the copying machine comprises flash lights 11, a flat mirror 12 and a zoom lens 13 which is displaceable along line 14 to vary the imaging ratio. Reference 15 denotes a photoconductive element running over a number of rollers, which are not given any references in Fig. 1, and a drive roller 16. The following are disposed successively along the trajectory of the photoconductive element 15 a charging device 17, a discharge device 18 for fading out those zones of the photoconductive element 15 which are situated outside the imaging plane, a developing device 20 for developing a charge image formed in the exposure plane 19, a transfer device 21 and a cleaning device 22. Transfer device 21 comprises a first endless belt 23 provided with a soft resilient outer covering of silicone rubber and a second similar endless belt 24. Belt 23 is heated by heating means not shown in Fig. 1 . The belt 23 presses against the photoconductive element 15 in a first pressure zone 25, where it takes the powder image over from the photoconductive element. The image, which has softened in the meantime, is transferred from belt 23 to a sheet of receiving material in a second pressure zone 26. This sheet of receiving material is fed via guides 27, 28 and 29, first to a position against a retaining member 30, where the sheet is aligned, and then into the nip of the conveyor rollers 43. From there the sheet is fed to the pressure zone 26 at the correct time. A printed sheet is discharged via guide 33. When copies printed on only one side are required, this sheet is then fed between the cooperating conveyor belts 34 and 35 and the adjoining guides 36, 37 and 38, to a collecting table 39. When copies printed on both sides are required, the deflector 40 is moved upwards so that a sheet printed on one side supplied via guide 33 is fed to a holder 41. Holder 41 is then brought into the position shown in broken lines and the sheet printed on one side is conveyed by the rollers 42 to the nip between the roller 43. From there the sheet is again conveyed to pressure zone 26 at the correct time. A copy printed on both sides is fed to the collecting table 39 via the guides 33, 36, 44, 45, 46 and 38 or via the guides 33, 36, 37 and 38. When copies printed on both sides are being made from originals printed on only one side, the copies are always transported via the guides 33, 36, 44, 45, 46 and 38. If the copies printed on both sides are made from double sided originals, the copy transport is via the guides 33, 36, 44, 45, 46 and 38 during the production of the odd copy sets 1st, 3rd,...copy set and via the guides 33, 36, 37 and 38 during the production of the even copy sets 2nd, 4th,... copy set . This is as described in detail in European patent application No. 0073071. A control device 50 is provided to control the copying machine. As shown in Fig. 2, control device 50 comprises a central processing unit 51 connected via a data bus 52, an address bus 53 and a control bus 54, to a read only memory ROM 55, a random access read write memory RAM 56, a control panel 57 for inputting data and reproducing the input data concerning a required copying job and connecting circuits 58 and 58A. Connecting circuit 58 comprises a number of input gates 60,...62 and a number of output registers 63,...71. The central processing unit 51 can select one of the input gates 60,...62 or one of the output registers 63,...71 via address bus 53. The central processing unit 51 can read the input signals of the selected input gate or load a selected output register via data bus 52. The loading or reading process controls the central processing unit 51 along control bus 54. The input of input gate 60 is connected to a detector 74 see Fig. 1 . The inputs of the other input gates are connected to detectors disposed elsewhere in the copying machine for monitoring the copying process and, inter alia, checking whether the originals and sheets of receiving material are conveyed in the correct way. The outputs of registers 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 and 71 are connected to the control inputs of the original feed and discharge device, the ignition device for the flash lights 11, the charging device 17, the discharge device 18, the energizing device for the retaining member 30 and conveyor rollers 30A, the drive means for the rollers 43, the deflector 40, the actuating means for the holder 41 and conveyor rollers 42, and the actuating means for actuating the deflector in front of the entry to the guides 37 and 44, respectively. Connecting circuit 58A comprises a number of output registers, whose inputs are connected to data bus 52 and whose outputs are connected via a bus 58B to the adjustment device for the zoom lens 13. Connecting circuit 58A is also connected to address bus 53 and control bus 54. During the loading of the output registers, connecting circuit 58A is first selected via address bus 53 and is then so controlled via control bus 54 that the data offered via data bus 52 are loaded into the output registers. Via bus 58C the data loaded in the connecting circuit 58A are offered to the adjusting device for the zoom lens 13, whereupon the adjusting device adjusts the zoom lens according to the offered data. A pulse generator 75 is connected to the program interrupt input of the central processing unit 51 and delivers pulses at a frequency proportional to the speed of the photoconductive element 15. To control the copying process, the central processing unit 51 performs a program which is stored in the read only memory 55. Depending upon the copying order input via the control panel and the positions in which the various copies being made are situated inside the copying machine, the central processing unit 51 controls the switching on and off of the members and devices required for making the copy. For registering the positions of the copies being made the program makes use of a pulse counter, with which, for each copy being made, registering is carried out in respect of the number of pulses generated by the pulse generator 75 from the time at which the copying process was started for the copy in question. The execution times of each switching on and switching off command for the various functions of the copying machine are stored in the memory in an action table and are expressed in that action table as the number of pulses requiring to be counted from the start of the copying process for the copy in question. After each newly generated pulse of pulse generator 75 the pulse counter is updated and the updated counter state is compared with the content of the associated action table and, if a counter state has been reached at which a command must be executed, the program subroutine required for that purpose is started. In executing a copying order in which no instruction is input via the control panel 57 to change the width of the image free edge zones on the copies, the various functions of the copying machine are so controlled in accordance with a standard action table that the edge of an original abutting bar 10 is reproduced on the trailing edge of the sheet of receiving material. The originals and the receiving material are fed through the copying machine in the transverse direction. By pressing button M on the control panel 57 the central processing unit 51 is instructed that a copying order is required to be executed in which the width of the image free edge zones must be changed at the left and right hand sides of the copy. After button M has been pressed, the operator inputs via control panel 57 the data concerning the width of the image free left hand and right hand edge zone of the original and these data are stored at places intended for that purpose in the read write memory 56. If the originals are printed on both sides, something that the operator has indicated by pressing a button intended for that purpose on the control panel 57, then after the inputting of the data concerning the front of the original, the data concerning the width of the image free edge zones of the back of the original are also input. In the event of there being no data input concerning the back of the original, the central processing unit 51 assumes that the image areas of the front and back of the original coincide, and hence that the left hand edge zone of the back is equal to the right hand edge zone of the front and that the right hand edge zone of the back is equal to the left hand edge zone of the front. After inputting of the data concerning the original, the data concerning the required minimum width of the corresponding image free edge zones on the receiving material are input via the control panel 57 and these data are also stored in places intended for that purpose in the read write memory 56. The latter data, however, are preferably already programmed in a non volatile part of the read write memory 56, because in that case there is no need for the operator to re input the data, and they can be changed by a service engineer or by the operator himself. The data concerning the image free edge zone on the copy indicate, for example, the required width of the image free edge zone on the left hand side of the copy and the minimum width of the image free edge zone on the right hand side of the copy looking in the reading direction . By reference to the data input concerning the dimensions of the image free edge zones of the original, the input or already stored data concerning the minimum dimensions required for the corresponding edge zones on the copy, and the received or stored data concerning the dimensions of the original and the receiving material, the central processing unit 51 carries out a calculation routine by means of which the imaging ratio and the required adjustment and or activating times of one or more process functions are calculated. The associated process functions are then adjusted or activated in accordance with the determined values. Process functions of which a change of adjustment results in a change of the dimensions of the image free edge zones on a copy are the bar 10 which can be moved to the left or right over the exposure window 9 the zoom lens 13 which can be moved in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis the drive for the photoconductive element 15 increasing or reducing the speed of element 15 . Process functions of which a change of the activation time results in a change of the dimensions of the image free edge zones on the copy are the activation time of the flash lights 11, the activation time of the conveyor rollers 43. By changing the imaging ratio in this case reducing the image the total of the dimensions of the image free edge zones is increased. By varying one or more of the above process functions the total of the dimensions remains constant, but the ratio between the dimensions varies. Fig. 3A represents for the copying order single sided originals single sided copies, the flow diagram of the calculation routine introduced by the central processing unit 51 in order to determine the imaging ratio and the adjustment or activation time of one of the above process functions, e.g. the activation time of the conveyor rollers 43. First, the imaging ratio is calculated in accordance with equation A from the data relating to the width of the image free edge zones of the original, the required width of the corresponding edge zones on the copies, the length of the original and of the receiving material both as considered in the direction of conveyance If S is positive, the activation time for the conveyor rollers 43 is brought forward with respect to the activation time stored in the standard action table, by a number of pulses from pulse generator 75 equivalent to the value calculated for S. If S is negative the activation time is delayed. Fig. 3B represents the calculation routine carried out for the copying order single sided originals double sided copies. First of all the imaging ratio Fd is again determined in the manner described above with respect to Fig. 3A. S is then determined in accordance with the above equation B for the front of the copy. For the back of the copy the image free edge zone on the right hand side must again be equal to the image free edge zone on the left hand side of the front of the copy. For the back of the copy the change S of the activation time of the conveyor rollers 43 is now determined from equation C S Fd.D2 K1 C Once again if S is positive, the activation time for the conveyor rollers 43 is brought forward, and if S is negative, the activation time is delayed. Fig. 3C represents the calculation routine for the copying order double sided originals single sided copies. The imaging ratio is now calculated from the equations A and G . The final imaging ratio Fd is then determined in the manner as described above in connection with the copying order single sided originals single sided copies, by comparing the smallest calculated value of F with the value Fb that the operator has indicated. For copies originating from the front of an original the change S of the activation time of the conveyor rollers 43 is then determined by equation B S K1 t Fd D1 t B For copies originating from the back of an original the change S2 of the activation time for the conveyor rollers 43 is determined by equation H S2 K1 t Fd D 1 t H . Given a positive result for S or S2, the activation time is brought forward and given a negative result it is delayed. Fig. 3D represents the flow diagram of the calculation routine carried out for the copying order double sided originals double sided copies. Fd is determined as described above for the copying order double sided originals single sided copies. For the front of the copy the change S of the activation time of the conveyor rollers 43 is again determined by means of equation B S K1 t Fd D1 t B For the back of the copy the change S of the activation time is determined by means of equation I S Fd.D 2 K1 I Once again, the activation time for the conveyor rollers 43 is advanced in the case of a positive result for S or S and delayed for a negative result for S or S . It will be apparent from the above equations that the central processing unit 51 must be informed as to the length of the original and the receiving material as viewed in their direction of conveyance, for the purpose of calculating the values of F, S and S2. If the copying machine is designed to process only one size of original and receiving material, these data will be stored in one of the memories 55 or 56. If the copying machine is intended for processing different original and reveiving material sizes, then it may be equipped, in manner known per se, for example in the holder 1 and the supply magazine for the stack of receiving material, with detectors which deliver to the central processing unit 51 signals representative of the original size and the receiving material size. The copying machine can also then be so constructed that the operator can input via the control panel 57 the data associated with the size of the original and of the receiving material. The reproduction device according to the invention can of course also be so constructed that if an order is received to change the dimensions of the image free edge zones of a copy the control device 50 always selects as the final imaging ratio Fd the imaging ratio F calculated by the central processing unit 51. In all cases in which the calculated imaging ratio F is within the range adjustable with the zoom lens 13, the resulting copies will have an image free edge zone width equal to the values input by the operator. If the calculated imaging ratio F is outside the range adjustable by the zoom lens 13, then the closest adjustable value is selected for Fd. If the calculated imaging ratio F is larger than 1, the image on the copy is enlarged as far as the reproduction device has the facility for this. It is also possible so to program the control device that image enlargement is never carried out. If the calculated imaging ratio F is larger than 1, then the value 1 will be selected for Fd. The control device 50 can be so constructed that the operator can input the values of D1, D2, D 1 and D 2 separately via the control panel for each original to be copied, or so that the operator can input only one value for D1, D2, D 1 and D 2 respectively for each copying order required. Since the originals belonging to the same document have in practice practically always the same dimensions for the image free edge zones, the latter embodiment will virtually never give rise to any problems and has the advantage that the inputting of the data concerning the required copying order can be carried out quickly. If, nevertheless, some originals in a document have image free edge zones whose dimensions differ from those of the other originals, the operator can first make copies of those differing originals, the dimensions of the image free edge zones of the copies corresponding to those of the other originals. These copies can then be included by the operator in the set of originals for copying, to replace the differing originals. In many copying departments the originals of different documents practically always have the same dimensions for the image free edge zones. To enable copying orders to be carried out quickly with such standard originals , it is possible so to construct the control device 50 that a fixed value for D1, D2, D 1 and D 2 of the original respectively can be programmed in the memory 56 and can be called up via the control panel whenever standard originals have to be copied.
