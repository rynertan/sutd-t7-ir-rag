## Description
CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to new chemical compounds and more particularly it relates to new dihydropyridine derivatives which possess antihypertensive properties. Many 2,6 dialkyl 4 aryl 1,4 dihydropyridine3,5 dicarboxylate derivatives are known which inhibit the movement of calcium ions in the cardiovascular system of warm blooded animals, and which thereby produce an antihypertensive effect. The most used of these is nifedipine, which is dimethyl 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 o nitrophenylpyridine 3 ,5 dicarboxylate. Also known are many l aryloxy 3 amino propan2 01 derivatives which possess beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties and which also produce an antihypertensive effect. Two of the most used of these are propranolol and atenolol, which are respectively l naphth l yloxy and l Ã§ carbamoylmethylphenoxy 3 i sopropyl ami nopropan 2 ol. The only described attempt to combine these two types of chemical structure into one molecule is reported by Merck workers in the Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 1981, Vol. 24, pages 628 to 631, in which a 3 amino 2 hydroxypropoxy substituent was introduced into the A aryl substituent of a 4 aryl 1,4 dihydropyridine derivative, without much success in producing a compound with anti hypertensive activity of the type sought by the authors. We have now found that compounds which do possess useful antihypertensive activity may be obtained by suitably combining a 3 aryl oxy 2 hydroxypropyl amino moiety with a 1,4 dihydropyridine moiety. According to the present invention there is provided a dihydropyridine of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R3 is alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein R4 is alpha branched chain alkyl or hydroxyalkyl each of up to 6 carbon atoms, or alpha branched chain arylalkyl or aryloxyalkyl each of up to 12 carbon atoms, or acylaminoalkyl wherein the acyl is is of up to 10 carbon atoms and the alkyl is of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein benzene ring A bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl and alkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms or bears the substi tuent N O N attached to the 2 and 3 positions that is, to form a benzo 2,1,3 oxadiazole nucleus wherein Ar is phenylene, naphthylene, tetrahydronaphthylene, indanylene or pyridylene which is unsubstituted or which bears one or more substituents selected from halogeno, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, nitro, carbamoyl and cyano, and alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkylthio, alkanoyl, carbamoylalkyl and alkanoylamino each of up to 6 carbon atoms wherein p is O or 1 wherein q is 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein X is O , NH , NHCO or CONH wherein X1 is a direct link or is O , S , NH or NHS02 and wherein Y is straight or branched chain alkylene of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which may optionally be interrupted by one or two groups selected from oxygen O , sulphur S , imino and substituted imino NR5 wherein R5 is hydrogen, alkyl or alkanoyl each of up to 10 carbon atoms, phenyl or aralkyl of up to 12 carbon atoms , phenylene, substituted phenylene, pyridylene, cycloalkylene of up to 6 carbon atoms, 1,4 piperazinediyl, 1 ,4 piperidinediyl and amido CONH or NHCO groups or an acid addition salt thereof. It will be observed that the dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses at least two asymmetric carbon atoms, namely the carbon atom of the CHOH group in the alkanolamine chain, and the carbon atom at the 4 position of the dihydropyridine nucleus, and it can therefore exist in racemic and optically active forms. It is to be understood that this invention encompasses the racemic form of the dihydropyridine derivative and any, optically active form which possesses antihypertensive activity, it being a matter of common general knowledge how a racemic compound may be resolved into optically active forms, and how the antihypertensive activity of these forms may be determined.It is further to be understood that beta adrenergic blocking activity usually predominates in that optically active form which has the S absolute configuration of the said CHOH group in the alkanolamine chain when p is 1 and the R absolute configuration when p is 0.

These are all standard tests used to demonstrate antihypertensive effects of medicaments. Some of the dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention possess beta adrenergic blocking properties, some of them possess calcium ion slow channel blocking properties and some of them possess both such activities. A preferred dihydropyridine derivative of the invention possesses both such activities. Betaadrenergic blocking activity may be demonstrated in vivo by the ability of the compound to inhibit isoprenaline induced tachycardia in a rat or cat, or in vitro by shifting to the right the dose response curve of a guinea pig atrium to isoprenaline. Calcium ion slow channel blocking activity may be demonstrated in vitro by the ability of the compound to reduce spontaneous contraction in a rat portal vein preparation. These also are all standard tests used to demonstrate the stated activities.

Methanesulphonyl chloride 0.34 ml. was added to a stirred mixture of the ethyl l,4 dihydro 2 2 2 hydroxyethoxy ethoxymethyl 6 methyl 5 methoxyc arbonyl 4 m ni trophenyl pyri di ne 3 c arboxyl ate thus obtained 2.0 g. , triethylamine 0.45 g. and methylene chloride 40 ml. which was cooled to 4 C., and the mixture was stirred at 0 C. for 2 hours, washed with aqueous 10 w v sodium carbonate solution and then with water, dried and evaporated to dryness. The residue 2.2 g. was added to a mixture of quinol 1.34 g. , potassium hydroxide 0.27 g. and dimethylformamide 10 ml. which had been heated under reflux for 15 minutes.The mixture was heated under reflux for 2 hours, water 20 ml. was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate 30 ml. The extract was washed with aqueous 10 w v sodium carbonate solution and then with water, dried and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel Merck 9385 r lunn using a 1 1 v v mixture of ethyl acetate and petroleum ether b.p. 60 80 C. as eluent. A mixture of the residual ethyl 1,4 dihydro 2 2 2 p hydroxyphenoxyethoxy ethoxymethyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl 4 m ni trophenylpyridi ne 3carboxylate 0.75 g. , epichlorohydrin 0.8 ml. , aqueous N sodium hydroxide solution 1.35 ml. and methanol 7 ml. was stirred at laboratory temperature for 80 hours, water 20 ml. was added and the mixture extracted twice with ethyl acetate 20 ml. each time .The combined extracts were washed with water, dried and evaporated to dryness, and there was thus obtained the desired ethyl pyridine 3 carboxylate which was used without further purification.Example 4 The process described in Example 1 was repeated using ethyl 2 2 E 3 chl oro 2 hydroxypropoxy phenoxyethoxymethyl 1,4 dihydro 5 methoxyzarbonyl 6 methyl 4 m nitrophenylpyridine 3 carboxylate and isopropylamine as starting materials. There was thus obtained as an oil ethyl 2 2 p 2 hydroxy 3 isopropyl ami nopropoxy phenoxyethoxymethyl l ,4 dihydro 5 methoxy carbonyl 6 methyl 4 m ni trophenylpyri di ne 3 carboxyl ate sesquihydrate, the structure of which was confirmed by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ethyl pyridine 3 carboxylate used as starting material was obtained as follows A mixture of 2 g hydroxyphenoxyethanol 4.0 g. , epichlorohydrin 18.2 ml. , aqueous N sodium hydroxide solution 29 ml. and ethanol 30 ml. was stirred at laboratory temperature for 4 days and then evaporated to dryness, and the residue was shaken with water 30 ml. and methylene chloride 30 ml. . The methylene chloride layer was passed through phaseseparating paper and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was stirred with dimethyl ether. The mixture was filtered and there was thus obtained as solid residue 2 p 2,3 epoxypropoxy phenoxyethanol, m.p. 60 62 C. A solution of the above compound 4.0 g. in tetrahydrofuran 10 ml. was added during 30 minutes to a stirred suspension of sodium hydride 1.8 g. of a 50 w w suspension in paraffin oil from which the paraffin had been washed with petroleum ether in tetrahydrofuran ml. and the mixture was stirred at laboratory temperature for 1 hour and then cooled to 0 C. A similar sequence of reactions to those described inExample 3 were then carried out using ethyl 4 chloro 3oxobutyrate 15.34 g in the first reaction, and 3.8 g.of the ethyl 3 oxobutyrate thus obtained, methyl 3aminocrotonate 1.17 g. , 3 nitrobenzaldehyde 1.53 g. and methanol 20 ml. in the second reaction. There was thus obtained the desired ethyl pyridine 3 carboxylate which was used without further purification.
