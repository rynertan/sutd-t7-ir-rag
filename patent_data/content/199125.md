# MULTI LAYER RESIST STRUCTURE

## Abstract
Disclosed are multi layered resist structures and methods of producing them which can be used in electronic device lithography to produce micrometer and sub micrometer geometries. The resist structure comprises two or more layers 12, 14, 16 at least one of which is a metallic material 14 and at least one of which is a radiation sensitive material 16 . The metallic layer 14 exhibits both a high atomic number and a high density. The metallic material is positioned relative to the radiation sensitive polymeric material 16 so that it can be used to control reflection and backscatter of radiation used to create a latent image 18 within the radiation sensitive polymeric material 16 . The thickness of the metallic layer 14 is determined by the amount of reflection desired and the amount of backscatter permitted into the layer of radiation sensitive polymeric material 16 .
