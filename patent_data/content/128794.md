# Apparatus and process for forming articles by heading.

## Abstract
An apparatus 100 and process for multistep heading of elongated stock to form a brush contact 10 with a relatively great reduction in the length of the wire stock material 368 achieved during successive heading steps. The apparatus 100 includes a rotary indexing holder plate 112 having holders 166 adapted to receive blanks severed from the wire stock 368 and index the same through successive forming stations. Head forming is achieved by a series of coning dies 240 and punches 244 carried by inde pendently actuated tooling plates 114, 116 which are axially advanced in timed relationship to cause the punches 244 and dies to engage the blanks and achieve the forming process. The final forming step involving a reverse extrusion to create an endwise axial opening 26 in the contact 10 . The apparatus 100 also includes a feed mechanism 148 and a cutoff mechanism 160 for advancing wire stock 386 into a holder 166 at a load station, severing a length to form a blank same and thereafter clamping the blank, which is then indexed through the successive forming stations. A clamping member 178 is associated with each holder 166 which opens to allow insertion of the wire stock 386 into the holder 166 at the load station and thereafter clamp ing the same for securement during the forming steps. The clamping member 178 is also unlocked at an ejection station to enable removal of the formed article by an ejection mecha nism 610 .
