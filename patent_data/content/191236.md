## Description
The present invention relates to insecticidal compositions, and in particular to pediculocidal compositions. The term pediculocidal as used herein is intended to refer to a composition useful in the treatment of head and or body and or crab lice and or lice eggs of all kinds. Hardly a city or village exists in any part of the world where not one or more individuals are infested with head lice. In the U.S.A. alone there were approximately 3 million known cases of Pediculosis in 1974. The present lice infestation is treated by either a mechanical procedure in combing the hair with a special comb, or pulling the lice body lice from one s clothes, or by use of insecticides. The insecticides, commonly used for lice treatment could be divided into two categories The latter are more effective, but usually are given only under physicians prescriptions. All these substances are supplied as lotions, shampoos, creams, dust or sprays. There is an almost countless number of insecticides that have been developed during the last 40 50 years, but only part of them are in common use world wide today. According to a report, published in 1982 by the United Nations World Health Organization WHO , there are only 10 compounds in everyday use table 1 . Three of the most commonly used are DDT, Lindane, Malathion. Those insecticides can be grouped into 4 groups, according to their chemical structure The first 3 groups are highly toxic, whilst the fourth group has low toxicity but it is not very effective. It is quite clear from data being received so far, that insecticides are all toxic and not at a low degree. However, there are more disadvantages in their use than that. Some of them are not very effective in killing eggs Pyrethrin, bioallethin , according to Lange K. et al, Acta Dermatovener, In conclusion the compounds at present in use are having disadvantages on three levels According to the present invention it has now been surprisingly discovered that quaternary ammonium compounds which have been used in many different non related applications and which are considered to be relatively non toxic can be effectively used in pediculocidal compositions. Since lice are a form of insect and are related to such other insects as termites, it is believed that the present composition can also be properly characterized as insecticidal compositions and also used as such. Thus, the present invention provides an insecticidal composition characterized in that it comprises a quaternary ammonium compound of the general formula I In especially preferred compositions, at least one of R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ is an alkyl group and preferably at least one of R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ is an alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms. As indicated hereinbefore, the compositions of the present invention have been found to be particularly useful as anti lice compounds and thus in a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a pediculocidal composition comprising a cosmetically acceptable quarternary ammonium compound of the general formula I wherein R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ may be the same or different and are each individually selected from the group consisting of methyl, C₈ to C₁₈ alkyl, or benzyl or wherein R₂, R₃ and R₄ are combined with the N to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted pyridine or quinoline group. Preferred compositions are those wherein at least one of R₁, R₂, R₃ or R₄ is an alkyl group having 8 to 18 carbon atoms and especially preferred are compositions wherein at least one of R₁, R₂, R₃ or R₄ is selected from the group consisting of methyl, cetyl, lauryl or benzyl. In the above compounds X is preferably iodine, bromine or chlorine and chlorine is especially preferred. The compositions of the present invention will preferably contain between about 0.8 and about 8.0 w v of the quaternary ammonium compound of formula I as active ingredient therein, although smaller amounts might also be used in certain cases, and especially preferred are compositions containing between about 1 and 4 w v active ingredient. The compositions of the present invention can be administered as dry powders or as aqueous or alcohol solutions and preferred compositions will contain about 0 to 70 of an alcohol solvent wherein said alcohol is preferably selected from ethanol, isopropanol and mixtures thereof. In summary, as is known, quaternary ammonium compounds hereinafter referred to as QACS are derivates of amines. They are made up by the gentle warming of tetriary amines plus alkyl halide as carbonium ion in alcoholic solvent resulting the percipitation of the QAC as crystaline salt. Since the nitrogen atom of the molecule is tied to 4 alkyl chains R , optical isomers are formed. Any R chain can be made of almost any alkyl exists within some limits like benzens, methyl, ethyl, cetyl, lauryl, oleyl, any fatty acid, etc. Of the many hundreds QAC known so far about 90 are allowed to be used in the cosmetic industry. Probably all these compounds are, to some extent, lethal to any lice colony especially at higher concentrations since all of the quaternary ammonium salts tested caused some mortality, but there are preferable compounds. QACS are characterized by a very large cation and a small anion mostly a hologen. In general, QACS containing Cl as anion are more active as lice killers than those containing Br , and those containing Br are more active than those with I or phosphate anion. The structure of the cation is also of importance. It has been noted that a cation containing a dimethyl group is more lethal to the lice than one containing a trimethyl group. The remaining R R s is best to be 8 18 carbons chain, preferably Lauryl CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁ Cetyl CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅ or Benzyl Quaternary ammonium compounds are also known as cationic detergents. Many modern germicides, fungicides and preservatives are quaternary ammonium compounds, the most well known in use is probably Benzalkonium chloride, which serves as sterilizing agent, but other, as cetyl pyridinum chloride or cetalkonium chloride serve the same purposes. In general, all quaternary ammonium compounds are combined of a very big cation of 1 to 4 Carbon Chains surrounding the N molecule and a small anion mostly a halogen Chloride, Bromide, Iodine but other anions as well. They are all good surfactants. Quaternary ammonium compounds also serve as anti static agents in hair conditioners and hair tonics. In restaurants, dairies, etc. they are popular disinfectants for containers, instruments, etc. In medicine, diluted solutions have been employed to sterilize the skin, conjunctivae and mucos membranes. They have also been used to keep water pools free of slime, mould, algae, fish pathogens and molluskas. Some served in textile industry as moth proofing agents, others as oil preservatives, soil pathogen eradicators, foilage sprays and deodorants. They behave like acidic colorants in textile. The concentrations usually used for disinfection, etc. are between 0.01 1.0 . The lethal effect, however, of quaternary ammonium compounds on lice, i.e., their action as insecticides , had never been mentioned in the literature. The preferred compounds for use in the compositions of the present invention are The most preferred compound is lauryl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and the second best compound is cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. Lauryl pyridinium chloride is also especially preferred since it can be applied as a solid. As mentioned before, anti lice products can be used in various ways, of which the common ones are shampoos, dusts, sprays, creams and lotions. Since we are dealing with cationic detergents, using them as shampoos mixed with animonic detergent is not possible, whilst the other kinds are feasible. Since sprays are not very effective anyway, powders Dust are limited only to dry compounds, such as Lauryl pyridinium chloride, the formula possible would be 15 10 Lauryl pyridinium chloride in a filler base as China clay. The recommended way of using the compounds would be as alcoholic or watery lotions, such as A spray would be based on the alcoholic formula, plus inertic gas such as freon. Cream can also be produced by using an o w or w o cream, containing 0.8 4 active ingredient as part of the water phase. While the invention will now be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments in the following examples, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to these particular embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Thus, the following examples which include preferred embodiments will serve to illustrate the practice of this invention, it being understood that the particulars described are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of preferred embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of procedures as well as of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. The following formulation was prepared by dissolving the lauryl pyridinium chloride in water with mild heating followed by cooking and addition of the alcohols Since lauryl dimethyl ammonium chloride is liquid there is no need for dissolving in water with heating as in Example 1 and therefore, the following two formulations were prepared by simple mixing of all the ingredients together Following the procedure of Example 2, the following two formulations were prepared Following the procedure of Example 2, the following two formulations were prepared Compositions according to the present invention were prepared, coded as follows, and submitted to the Medical Entomology Centre MEC at the Department of Applied Biology, University of Cambridge, for testing. The compounds were The following is an excerpt from the test report as received. Lice were from the laboratory strain regularly maintained by MEC. They are rabbit adapted human clothing lice Preliminary tests on these substances showed that lice that were engorged recently fed were more susceptible than lice fed the previous day. All lice used in these tests were fed not less than 24 hours prior to commencement. Separate tests were conducted against adult and nymphal mobile stages and against eggs. Lice were placed on a single disc of filter paper Whatman No. 1 in a Petri dish. 5 ml. of the test solution was pipetted onto each such that the solution was evenly distributed and all lice were wetted. The solution was poured off after 15 seconds. The volatile components were permitted to evaporate at room temperature for 20 minutes. The lice were then incubated at 27 C and 70 Relative Humidity R.H. . Each test used approximately 20 lice and in triplicate. Untreated controls were also incubated. Pieces of cotton corduroy cloth are used for lice to deposit their eggs during normal colony maintenance and changed at regular intervals. Eggs laid between 1 and 4 days previously were used in these tests. The corduroy pads were immersed in the test solutions for 30 second. During that time they were turned once to ensure thorough wetting of the eggs. After removal they were blotted dry between two paper towels. The dried corduroy pieces were inserted into bijou bottles and incubated at 27 C and 70 R.H. Each test was performed in triplicate and untreated controls were also set up. It is thus clearly seen that all three compounds kill all the lice totally adults, nymphs and eggs altogether. More data, on the dependency between lice mortality and the concentration of the compound tested was obtained by separate independent experiments carried out by the inventor in the same laboratory of MEC. These tests were carried out in order to find the lowest concentration of each compound that still cause 100 mortality amongst lice. Only adults were tested. The figures are arithmetical at the average of three duplicates, 20 lice each. The lice were put on 9 cm filter paper and dipped in the solution for 30 seconds, then left to dry. The dry papers with the lice were incubated for 24 hours in 28 C. and final figures were as follows The lice were exposed to one of the active compounds, lauryl dimethyl benzyl ammonium, in the same way as in Example 6. Mortality began 2 hours from exposure time. In 9 hours time almost all the lice had died. Having found a series of quaternary ammonium compounds with very high pediculocide activity, it was decided to compare their activity with some other compounds which are similar in one of the following criterions The ingredients used in these tests was purchased from the following suppliers While all the quaternary compounds have some effect the chloride more than the phosphate all other compounds are, relatively, non active.
