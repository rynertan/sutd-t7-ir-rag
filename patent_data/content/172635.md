# TEMPERATURE CONTROL IN VACUUM

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 and a method are provided for treating silicon wafers 26 in vacuum with an ion beam B and for controlling the temperature of the wafers 26. The wafers 26 are mounted on a drum 22 which is rotated through the ion beam B, and which is large enough that the mean equilib rium temperature of the wafers 26, in the absence of any other energy sources, would be less than the desired temperature. The wafers 26 are additionally heated by infra red lamps 34 so the desired temperature is achieved.
