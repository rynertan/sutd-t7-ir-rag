# Superconductive rotor, and electric machine incorporating it.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a structure for supporting a power lead 3 connected to a superconductive field coil 2,6 and refrigerant supply and discharge pipes 7, 11 in the hollow shaft 14 of the superconductive rotor. A plurality of spacers 15 for holding the power lead 3 and the re frigerant supply and discharge pipes 7,11 are fitted in a supporting sleeve 16 , and fixed at 19 from the outer peripheral side of the supporting sleeve, the supporting sleeve itself being fixed in the cavity of the hollow shaft 14 by centering screws 17 . Since the fixing work can be made from the outer peripheral side by means of the structure stated above, it is possible to fix the leads and pipes to the inside of the shaft easily and rigidly, and to avoid the generation of vibration so as not to seriously damage the stability of the superconductive state of the rotor.
