## Abstract
A method for making contact to a small area field effect transistor device is described. A monocrystalline semicon ductor body 10 having at least a surface region of a first conductivity type is provided with an insulating layer 14 over the surtace region. A substantially horizontal first con ductive layer 16 is formed over the insulating layer. The insulating and first conductive layers are masked and etch ed to form openings in the layers to the semiconductor body where the source 26 , drain 28 and gate region of the device is to be formed. The openings have substantially vertical surfaces on the layered structure. A conformal, highly doped conductive layer 20, 22 of the first conductiv ity type is formed over the openings having these substan tially vertical surfaces and over the insulating and conduc tive layers. The conformal conductive layer is anisotropi cally etched to substantially remove the horizontal portions of the conformal layer while leaving the openings with a substantially vertical conformal conductive layer on the sides thereof. The semiconductor body with the layered structure thereon is heated at a suitable temperature to cause the dopant of a second conductivity type to diffuse into the semiconductor body from the conformal conductive lay er to form the source 26 and drain 28 regions and a first insulating layer 24 upon the surface of the first conductive layer and the conformal conductive layer. A second insulat ing layer 36 is formed over the vertical conformal conduc tive layer. Then a gate dielectric 40 is formed upon the surface of the semiconductor body between the source and drain regions. Electrical contacts 52, 56 are made to the first conductive layer through the first insulator layer 24 which effectively make electrical contact to the source and drain regions via the horizontal conductive layer and the vertical conformal conductive layer.
