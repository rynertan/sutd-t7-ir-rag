# Multiple access communications system.

## Abstract
A multiple access communications system for an unli mited user population is disclosed wherein a system con troller continuously transmits Aloha signals on a slot by slot basis giving an updated number of time slots available whereby a calling party can select any one of the designat ed time slots at random. The calling party checks the time slot immediately preceding its selected time slot to ascer tain if the current Aloha number is zero or an equivalent thereof . if it is zero then the calling party reverts to listening for a time slot containing an Aloha number greater than ze ro. Alternatively if it is not zero the calling apparatus sends a signal to the system controller in its selected time slot. Multipurpose signalling in each time slot can be carried out by the system controller thereby reducing the overhead on the system and speeding up the setting up of calls which may be off air or non off air.
