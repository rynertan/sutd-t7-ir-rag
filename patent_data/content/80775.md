# CONTAINER CLOSURE

## Abstract
An improved easy opening container end is disclosed of the type wherein an opening tab is attached to a wall of a can end closure at a fulcrum adjacent a primary score line. The primary score line circumscribes a pour opening panel except at a hinge area. The forward portion of the opening tab is adapted to depress the pour opening panel into the container to expose a pour opening when the opening tab is pivoted about the fulcrum. The opening tab is attached to the wall by means of a rivet. One secondary score line intersects with the primary score line and projects away from the pour opening panel on one side of the rivet and another secon dary score line, also intersects with the primary score line, and projects away from the pour opening panel on the other side of the rivet. In this manner, after the primary score line is severed and the pour opening panel is depressed, the opening tab may be retracted from the vicinity of the pour opening panel by severing the secondary score line so as to provide easy removal of the contents of the container and to expose an underportion of the wall for the reading of promotional indicia. In another embodiment, a region of the wall contiguous with the pour opening panel and further defined by a secondary score line may be provided such that after depression of the pour opening panel, the pour opening panel, and the region attached thereto by means of a hinge area may be severed from the container end along with the opening tab.
