The compound of the invention may be present in the composition as sole therapeutic agent or it may be present together with other therapeutic agents such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. Considerable advantages accrue from the inclusion of a penicillin or cephalosporin which shows instability to P lactamases since the resulting composition shows enhanced effectiveness synergy .

Naturally if the penicillin or cephalosporin present in the composition is not suitable for oral administration then the composition will be adapted fo parenteral administration. Highly favoured penicillins for use in the compositions of this invention include ampicillin, amoxycillin, carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Such penicillins may be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as the sodium salt.

Orally administrable compositions containing a compound of the invention will normally contain relatively more synergist than corresponding injectable colflpositions. The total quantity of a compound of the invention in any unit dosage form will normally be between 25 and 1000 mg and will usually be between 50 and 500 mg, for example about 62.5, 100, 125, 150, 200 or 250 mg.

The penicillin or cephalosporin in the synergistic composition of this invention will normally be present at approximately the amount at which it is conventionally used which will usually be expected to be from about 62.5 to 3000 mg per dose, more usually about 125, 250, 500 or 1000 mg per dose.

Most suitably the preceding composition will comprise Irom 50 to 250 mg of a compound of this invention preferabl in crystalline form. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral use except when containing an in vivo hydrolysable ester of ampicillin or amoxycillin in which case the compositions will not be adapted for parenterl administration. Another particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 200 to 2000 mg of carbenic llin, ticarcillin or a pro drug therefor and from 50 to 500 g of a compound of the invention. Suitably this form of composition will contain di sodium carbenicillin. Suitably this form of the composition will contain di sodium ticarcillin. More suitably this form of the composition will contain from 75 to 250 mg of a compound of this invention preferably in crystalline form. Such compositions containing di salts of carbenicillin and ticarcillin w ll be adapted for parenteral administration. The present invention also provides a method ol treating bacterial infection in humans or domestic mammals which comprises the administration of a composition of this invention. Commonly the infection treated will be due to strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aeroaenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Bacteroides fragilis or the like. The organisms believed to be most readily treated by an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of this invention is Staphylococcus aureus.The other organisms named are more readily treated by using a synergistically effective amount of the compound of the invention and a penicillin or cephalosporin. Te administration of the two components may take place separately but in general we prefer to use a composition containing both the synergist and the penicillin or cephalosporin. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula II or salt or aster thereofiwhich process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula III EMI18.1 or reactive derivative thereof, wherein Ra is a carboxyblocking group with a compound of the formula IV EMI18.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in relation to a compound of the formula II , and R4 is a displaceable group and thereafter if necessary i removing any carboxy blocking group ii converting the product into a free acid salt or ester, Suitably R4 is a displaceable group, such as a C1 100 hydrocarbon oxy group, for example an aryloxy, aryl C1,6 alkoxy or C 16 alkoxy group. Preferably R4 is C 1 6 alkoxy such as methoxy or ethoxy. It is believed that this reaction is an equilibr .um reaction and therefore it is preferred that R4 be chosen such that R4H is removed or consumed during the reaction, such removal for example would be conveniently performed by evaporation, or under reduced pressure, if R4 H is volatile. The reaction is suitably performed in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or halogenated hydrocarbons for example dichloromethane or chloroform.If the nature of the compound of the formula IV permits it may be more convenient to perform the reaction in the absence of solvent, the compound of the formula IV effectively being the solvent. The reaction may be conveniently be performed at an ambient or elevated temperature, for example between 150C and 800C, more suitably between 150C and 600C, and most suitably at about 30t to 400C. In another aspect the reaction may be performed under a partial vacuum such as 10 to 20 mm Hg, which serves, where appropriate, to remove the by product P 4 H from the reaction mixture. If this partial vacuum removes reagents or solvent from the reaction mixture then of course these may be replenished. In a preferred embodiment an acid catalyst is present, for example a Lewis acid or protonic acid.Suitably the catalyst is an organic acid such as acetic acid. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2Ra in formulae III include salts, esters, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. The salts need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable salts include inorganic salts, for example metal salts such as silver or mercuric salt, or alkali metal salts such as the lithium or sodium salt, and tertiary amine salts. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions. Such groups for Ra include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3,5 di t butyl 4hydroxybenzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, acetonyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, pentachlorophenyl, p toluenesulphonylethyl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, an oxime radical of formula N CHR where R is aryl heterocyclic, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester. The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Ra group, for example, basecatalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. When it is desired to produce a compound of formula II in the form of a free acid or salt by the process of this invention, a compound of formula III is generally employed wherein Ra is a carboxyl blocking group. For the preparation of a compound of formula II in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, it is convenient to employ a compound of formula III wherein Ra represents the desired ester group. Preferably the process of this invention is performed on a compound of the formula III whereinRa is an ester forming group. The compounds of the formula III are disclosed in British Patent Specifications 1508977 and 1508978. The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention.
