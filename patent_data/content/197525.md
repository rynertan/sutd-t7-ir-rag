## Description
The present invention relates to a plant culture cell derived from tissues or cells of plants belonging to The number of blood examinations become increased, because wealthy data relating to conditions of health and disease will be obtained by examination and analysis of blood, particularly serum. Intensive studies have been made for an effective separation serum. It has been known that separation is effectively made by using a serum separating agent a partition forming polymer material having a specific gravity between serum and blood solids together with a blood coagulation accelerating agent. As the blood coagulation accelerating agents, silicate particles, fibrous materials, calcium compound particles are exemplified, but they do not exhibit sufficient blood separation capacity. They even exhibit hemolysis occasionally. Accordingly, blood coagulation accelerating agents having excellent properties are desired. It is found that a water pennywort New Picture Book of the Japanese Flora to Makino, published by Hokuryukan, page 433 , which has been used for stopping bleeding by people, has the blood coagulation property. Since the water pennywort Components obtained from plants may be classified based on their functions to a blood coagulation component which indicates a blood coagulating function and a component for improving mental disease which improves mental diseases. One of the inventors of the present invention previously found that an important component in the blood coagulation component is l sesamin represented by the following formula It is difficult to produce l sesamine in large quantities even by way of chemical syntheses, because l sesamine is an optically active substance having a complicated chemical structure. The present invention is to enable the blood coagulation component and a mental disease therapeutic component, particularly a component for suppressing neurotropic spasm, to produce in large quantities by way of adopting a plant tissue culture technique which has been recently close uped. The plant tissue culture can grow plants in very high rates in comparison with natural plants growing in a year or month term. Accordingly, the object substance can be obtained in a short term. The plant tissue culture also is not affected by weather and necessary components can be gathered without lots of labors, and it can be intentionally carried out in an industrial scale. The culture cell or culture tissue of The present invention relates to cultured plant cells derived from tissues or cells of a plant belonging to The present invention also relates to a method for preparing cultured plant cells comprising culturing tissues or cells of a plant belonging to In the present invention, a plant employed belongs to The portion to be cultured of the plant is all tissues of the plant belonging to The cultured plant cells are plant cells derived from the tissue or cell of plants and artificially cultured in a container. The cultured plant cells include callus tissues, differentiated cultured tissues, a cultured organ tissues. The callus tissues hereinafter simply referred to callus are cultured plant cells lump only consisting of shapeless undifferentiated cells propagated over solid culture medium containing plant hormones or in liquid culture medium containing the plant hormones. The differentiated tissues are cultured plant cells lump composed of tissue having been differentiated such as a root, a bud or a shoot , and undifferentiated cells. Included are adventive buds consisting of bud tissues and undifferentiated cells , adventive roots consisting of root tissues and undifferentiated cells and cormus cultivated tissues consisting of shoot tissues and undifferentiated cells . The cultured organs are cultured plant cells lump solely consisting of differentiated tissues which include cultures roots, cultures shoot. A method for culturing cells is illustrated by adopting A stalk containing petioles and terminal buds of Besides the above petiole or terminal bud, the plant tissue or cell to be cultured may be any other portions, such as a division tissue or a node tissue including a lateral bud, a leaf, a stalk, or a root. The cell obtained by treating the above mentioned tissue or cell, such as a protoplast can also be employed. Further a tissue or cell which has already cultured hereinafter culture tissue or culture cell is used. The culture medium for culturing the plant tissue is known inorganic synthetic agar culture mediums added with a trace organic material, a carbon source, a various natural and an extract together with an auxine and or a cytokinin. Typical examples of the culture mediums are a White culture medium, a Linsmaier skoog and a Murashige skoog culture medium. These culture medium can be changed in its composition. The trace organic materials include vitamines such as tiamine hydrochloride, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and nicotinic acid, amino acids such as glycine, and asparagine and heptahydric alcohols such as inositol and sorbitol. The culture medium without adding the trace organic materials may arise good propagation in some cases. The carbon sources include carbohydrates such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, organic acids such as acetic acid, and alcohols such as methanol, and glycerol. Preferred are sucrose and glucose because of rapid growing rate of plant cell. The concentration of the carbon sources is within the range of 1 to 10 w v, preferably 3 to 5 w v. Examples of the auxines are 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4 D , beta indoleacetic acid IAA , alpha naphthaleneacetic acid NAA , or a mixture thereof. The amount of the auxines is not more than 10 ⁴, preferably not more than 10 ⁵, more preferably within the range of 10 ⁷ to 10 ⁵. The cytokinins includes kinetin, benzyladenine, and a mixture thereof. The amount of the cytokinin is not more than 10 ⁴, preferably not more than 10 ⁵, more preferably within the range of 10 ⁷ to 10 ⁵. Examples of the natural extracts mentioned above are casein hydrolysates 0.01 to 2 w v , coconuts milk 5 to 20 w v , yeast extracts 0.01 to 2 w v , malt extracts 0.01 to 2 w v , or a mixture thereof. Culture can be carried out bu exposing to light, preferably a light having more than 1,000 lx for more than 16 hours per day. The resultant culture cells can be either a tissue culture callus or a differentiated tissue depending on the portion of the plant tissue being cultured or a combination of the auxines with the cytokinins. Callus is generally obtained in many conditions. In case where the tissue is a division tissue, especially a terminal bud or a lateral bud, where the auxines are indoleacetic acid or naphthaleneacetic acid, or where the culturing is conducted under light especially having 5,000 lx for more than 16 hours, a differentiated tissue, particularly a cormus culture tissue can be obtained. The derivation for differentiating the callus to an adventive bud depends on the amount of the auxines and cytokinin or the conditions of light exposure. Preferred condition is set to a combination of 0 to 10 ⁶ M of the auxine for example 2,4 D with 0 to 10 ⁶ of the cytokinin for example kinetin and the light exposure of more than 16 hours at 5,000 lx. Adventive roots are formed from the callus depending on the amount of the auxines and cytokinins. Preferred amount is a combination of 0 to 10 ⁶ M of the auxines, typically indole acetic acid or naphthaleneacetic acid and 0 to 10 ⁶ M of the cytokinin. The cultures roots can be generally derived from the adventive root by cutting off the end portion containing growing point of the adventive root using a knife and placing it on the agar culture medium or into the liquid culture medium to culture. Besides the adventive roots, roots which are developed from a seed under a sterilized condition or which is artificially developed from a plant by inoculating Agrobacterium lisogenase can be employed. As the culture medium, it is preferred that the auxine, preferably indole acetic acid or naphthaleneacetic acid, is added in an amount of 0 to 10 ⁶ and the cytokinin is added in an amount of 0 to 10 ⁶. The culture is conducted either in a dark place at 20 to 30 C for solid culturing medium or in a shaker of 50 to 150 rpm for liquid culture medium, but these are not limited. A cultured shoot can be generally derived from the shoot culture tissues mentioned above as generally described relating to the cultured roots. The cultured cells can be industrially obtained by culturing and propagating in a similar method of culturing of general microbes. The liquid culture can be classified to a shaking method culture in a shaker and a bubbling method culture by introducing a sterilized air into a container made of glass or metal. The blood coagulation component can be obtained from the culture cell mentioned above by a known separating method, such as extraction or heating. A blood coagulation component obtained by extraction is preferred because of high blood coagulation property. Extraction method is illustrated by employing the culture cells of The culture cell obtained above is dried by a freeze drying or an air drying at 60 C for 24 hours or at 110 C for 3 hours to remove water. The dried cultured cells are extracted in acetone by a Soxhlet apparatus, a digestion method, or a maceration method. Instead of acetone, the other organic solvent such as methanol, and ethanol may be used for the extraction. Acetone is removed from the extract to obtain a concentrated acetone extract having blood coagulation propety and hemostasis property. The blood coagulation component contains l sesamine. l Sesamine can be obtained from the resultant acetone extract. For obtaining l sesamine, water and ethyl acetate are added to the concentrated acetone extract to distribute to water layer and organic layer. In stead of ethyl acetate, the other organic solvents such as chloroform, methylene dichloride, n hexane, ethyl ether, benzene, methyl acetate, n pentane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether can be employed. The distributed organic layer is subjected to a distillation to concentrate. The concentrated extract is subjected to a separation by a column chromatography to obtain a crude l sesamine. Besides the column chromatography, the other separation methods, such as a thin film chromatography can be employed. The resultant l sesamine may be identified by a silica gel G film chromatography, an infrared spectrum and NMR spectrum. The blood coagulation component can be used for a purpose of separation of serum from blood in a short time for a serum examination, for a purpose of shortening the determination time for a blood coagulation examination, for a purpose of stopping bleeding from a living body. It has been also found that the plant extract or the plant culture tissue of the present invention, per se, has mental disease therapeutic function. In addition, an extract from plants also has the same function. The extraction can be conducted as the extraction of the blood coagulation component.
