# Magnetic tape apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape apparatus comprises a deck 1 carrying a cylindrical drum assembly 3 provided with at least one rotatable magnetic head 7 . On the deck 1 a sliding plate 31 is guided for rectilinear movement towards and away from the drum assembly 3 . The sliding plate carries at least two tape guides 73 to 76 which are spaced from one another and which, when a tape cassette is positioned in or on the apparatus lead a part of the magnetic tape 84 in the cassette to the drum assembly 3 by a movement of the sliding plate 31 towards the drum system 3 . The deck 1 carries two winding spindles 12, 13 for winding and unwinding the magnetic tape respectively. The sliding plate 31 is provided with positioning means 31d which position the tape guides 73 76 relative to the drum assembly 3 in an end position of the sliding plate 31 . The sliding plate is also provided with first control means 69,79 which control two pivotal arms 62b, 63b which are arranged on the deck and which carry tape guides 65, 66 . Further, the sliding plate carries second control means 60 which control a pressure roller lever 32 carrying a pressure roller 34 . The sliding plate also carries third control means 31a which control an idler wheel 26 for driving one of the winding spindles 12, 13 .
