# User interface processor for computer network.

## Abstract
A processor forms part of a computer network wherein the processor, designated as the User Interface Processor, operates to initialize and maintain and communicate to remote diagnostic terminals for purposes of confirming integrity of the system and also for finding the location of any faults or prob lems in the system. The User Interface Processor involves a microprocessor unit working in conjunction with a serial com munications controller, RAM and ROM memories, a communi cations input output system, a multiple set of timer units and a priority interrupt controller. The User Interface Processor pro vides interfaces to a power control card unit, an I O subsystem of data link processors , and a remote terminal for diagnostic intercommunication.
