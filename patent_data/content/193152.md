# APPARATUS FOR MONITORING A WASHING SOLUTION CONTAINING SURFACTANTS

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a source of linearly polarized light to be propagated through the washing solution and to be diffuced by the micelles and the emulsion. Photodiodes receive the diffused light through respec tive analyzers oriented with their polarization directions parallel to the polarization direction of the primary light, and perpendicularly thereto, respectively. The apparatus deter mines the condition of the washing solution at the microsco pic level by the use of variations of the polarization of the radiation diffused by the micelles and by the emulsion.
