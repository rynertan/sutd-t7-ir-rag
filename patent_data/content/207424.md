## Description
The present invention relates to new glycosides anthracyclins and to medications containing these glycosides. The Applicant Company, pursuing the investigation undertaken concerning the synthesis of new glycosides of high therapeutic value see, in particular, the Applicant Company s French Patent No. 84 03 634 has developed a new and economically very interesting process for the preparation of chiral tetralins, precursors of aglycones, which are essential for the preparation of the new anthracyclins. They can also be used to prepare see products I to IV below 4 demethoxydaunomycinone III or 4 demethoxyadriamycinone IV , which, when coupled with daunosamine 3 amino 2,3,6 trideoxy L Lyxohexopyranose yield 4 demethoxydaunorubicin and adriamycin, which are more active and less toxic than the parent compounds. see, e.g. F. Arcamone et al. Cancer Treat. Rep., 1976 , The compounds described in Tetrahedron Letters, 1985 , The instant Application solves this problem by proposing new anthracyclins, which are significantly less toxic and more specifically less cardiotoxic than the compounds of the prior Art. The anthracyclins according to the invention are The anthracyclins according to the invention have S configuration at carbon atom 9 and, optionally in the case of a second chiral carbon atom S configuration at carbon atom 7. These two configurations are those of the natural molecules, the only ones to be active, in contrast to their enantiomers or their diastereoisomers. In addition, the presence of the isopropylidene group between the tertiary OH and the OH of the hydroxymethyl group attached to the same carbon atom S, mits simple protection of the hydroxymethyl group during the glycosidation of the hydroxy group at carbon atom 7 and preparation of 7 0 α L glycosyl derivatives which are essential for obtaining a remarkable antitumor activity. According to an advantageous embodiment of the subject of the invention, the hydroxyl protecting group consists of tert butyldimethylsilyl or methylethoxymethyl. The instant anthracyclins may be obtained by glycosidation of the glycone of the following formula I with various pent or hexoses activated by the action of a halogen donor, followed by removal of protecting groups from the aglycone and then from the carbohydrate moiety. The pent or hexoses taking part in the glycosidation reaction may be activated either in the form of a derivative halogenated in an anomeric position of in the form of iodonium. The removal of protection from the aglycone is carried out by an acid hydrolysis and the removal of protection from the carbonhydrate by an alkaline hydrolysis. The operational schemes will consequently be as follows after 1st acid hydrolysis XXIV R H R₁ Ac after 2nd alkaline hydrolysis XXV R R₁ H after 1st acid hydrolysis XXVII R H R₁ Ac after 2nd alkaline hydrolysis XXVIII R R₁ H The glycosides XXIII , XXIV and XXV , for example, are obtained by coupling the aglycone I with di The glycosides XXVI , XXVII and XXVIII are obtained by glycosidation of I with di O acetyl The aglycone I may be obtained from tetralins containing at least one chiral carbon atom and corresponding to the formula V below in which R₁ and R₂ denote a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom or the group OCH₃, provided that one of the two sustituents R₁ or R₂ must denote OCH₃, and R₃ denotes a hydrogen atom or the group OR , R being hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group. To convert the tetralins V to anthracyclinones, i.e. to construct the anthracyclinone framework A B C D from tetralins V which represent the future rings A and B, several routes which are described in the literature may be employed. It is possible, for example, to carry out Thus, to gain access to the anthracyclinones I or from the quinone monoacetal XIX obtained by anodic oxidation of V , followed by selective hydrolysis, Coupling of the products Vb , XIX and XX with appropriate substrates readily provides access, after removal of the protecting group, to anthracyclinone I . In addition to the preceding arrangements, the invention also incorporates other arrangements which will become apparent from the following description. The invention will be understood better with the aid of the following additional description which refers to examples of implementation of the process which is the subject of the present invention, together with a report on pharmacological experiments. It should be clearly understood, however, that these examples of implementation and of the report on pharmacological experiments are given solely by way of illustration of the subject of the invention, and consequently do not constitute a restriction of any sort.

The number of cells placed in the dishes is reduced to 5 10² dish on account of the rapid growth of the L 1210 leukemia cells. The cells are incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in the presence of various concentrations of the tested substance. The cells are then washed twice with Mc Coy 5 A and placed on agarose plates according to the method of Hamburger and Salmon. Furthermore, the test is carried out in parallel with continuous incubation with various concentrations of the substance under study by introducing the substance into the agarose layer before the cells are left to incubate. The dishes are placed in the oven at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5 CO₂ and 20 O₂, and a relative humidity of 95 for 5 to 7 days. After this time the colonies with a diameter greater than 60 mcm are counted with the aid of a reversed microscope. The results summarized in Table I below are expressed as a percentage of the colonies produced with treated L 1210 cells compared to the untreated controls. When the experiments are repeated, the variation coefficient is less than 15 . Two experiments are carried out, one with 1 hour s exposure, the other with continuous exposure. The daily dosage in man is of the order of 1 to 2 mg kg, expressed as active substance. As follows from the above, the invention is in no way restricted to those of its methods of use, of implementation and of application which have just been described in a more explicit manner on the contrary, it includes all the alternative forms which may occur to the expert in this field, without departing from the limits nor from the scope of the present invention.
