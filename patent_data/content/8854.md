The invention relates to insecticidal pentadienone hydrazones of formula I or II EMI1.1 wherein R1 is in the meta or para position and is selected from the group consistinq of haloaen.CF3 , CHF2CF20 and CH Fj Y R2 is hydrogen orEMI1.2 R3 and Rg may be the same or different and are selected from Cl Cl7 alkyl, C2 C17 al kenyl andEMI1.3 R4 and R5 are each hydrogen or methyl R7 and R8 are hydrogen, halogen, C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy Y is oxygen or sulfur m is an integer selected from 0, 1 or 2 n is an integer selected from 0 or 1 R11 and R12 are each selected from Y CF2X , hydrogen or halo, provided that at least one but not both of Rlland R12 is Y CF2X Y is selected from hydrogen, fluorine, CHF2 or CHC12 X is oxygen or sulfur R13 and R14 each are alkyl C1 C4 and, when taken together, they form an alkylene group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms or a methyl or a dimethyl substituted alkylene group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and the inorganic acid addition salts thereof. A preferred group of compounds represented by formula I are those wherein R1 is trifluoromethyl R2 is hydrogen orEMI2.1 R3 and R6 may be the same or different and are selected from Cl Cl7 alkyl, C2 C17 alkenyl andEMI2.2 R7 and R8 are selected from hydrogen, halogen,C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy and m is 0 or 1.Further, a preferred group of compounds represented by hereinabove defined formula II are those wherein R11 is selected from CHF2O , CHF2S , CF30 , CF3S or CHF2 CF20 R12 is hydrogen and R13 and R14 taken together with the amidino group they are attached to represent the moiety EMI2.3 EMI2.4 In general, the compounds of formula I whereinR2 is hydrogen, can be conveniently prepared by acylating a pentadienone hydrazone with an acid halide as shown below EMI3.1 wherein each of the R groups and m are as hereinabove defined X is halogen, preferably chlorine. Accordingly, a pentadienone hydrazone of formula III is reacted with an equimolar or even a slight excess of an acid halide, preferably chloride, of formula EMI3.2 in the presence of an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ether and the like and a Cl Cs trialkylamine at a temperature of 10 to 300C for a period of time sufficient to complete the reaction. When two or more moles of acid halide are employed in the above reaction, formula I compounds are obtained wherein R2 isEMI3.3 and where each of the Rs are as above defined.Alternatively, the nów acylated compound of structure I wherein R7 is H may be acylated a second time with a different acylating agentEMI3.4 to give formula I products in which R2 isEMI3.5 and where each of the R s are as above defined. The thus obtained compounds of formula I may be purified, if desired, by procedures such as recrystalliza tion, column chromatography and the like. Similarly, the compounds of formula II can be conveniently prepared by a reaction sequence graphically illustrated and described as follows EMI4.1 Substituted Benzaldehyde vI EMI4.2 Substituted Pentadienone VII EMI4.3 wherein each of the R groups are as hereinabove defined and HX represents a mono or divalent inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydriodic acid. In the above sequence, the desired product II is shown as theHX salt. The corresponding pentadienone hydrazone free base may be obtained by treating the HX salt with an aqueous solution of a base, such as sodium or potassium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide. As above illustrated, two moles of a substituted benzaldehyde VI are reacted with one mole of acetone in an aqueous alcohol in the presence of an alkali metal base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide at a temperature range of 10 to 40 C, preferably 20 to 250C for a period of time from one to three hours, or until the condensation reaction is essentially complete to yield the corresponding pentadienone VII . Next, the so obtained pentadienone is condensed with an equimolar or, if desired, slight excess amount of a salt of the appropriate hydrazine VIII in an alcohol at 500C to 8O0C or at the boiling point of said alcohol for a period of time of one to five hours or until the condensation reaction is essentially complete to yield the salt of a pentadienone hydrazone II .Exemplary of the alcohols used in the above reaction sequences are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and mixtures thereof. The pentadienone hydrazone may be recovered from the above salt, if desired, by treating said salt with a dilute aqueous solution of an inorganic base, such as sodium or potassium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide. Advantageously, the acylated pentadienone hydrazones of formula I are three to twenty times more soluble in solvents and vegetable oils, than are their immediate corresponding precursors. The increased solubility of formula I compounds is of advantage in the preparation of various liquid concentrates and of baits. In general, the formula IA compounds below can be conveniently prepared by a reaction sequence graphically illustrated as follows EMI5.1 wherein each of the R groups and m are as hereinabove de fined and HX represents a mono or divalent inorganic acid. In the above sequence, the product IA is shown as the HX salt. The corresponding pentadienone hydra zone free base can be obtained further by treating same with an aqueous solution of a base, such as sodium or potassium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or triethylamine. To obtain compound IA , it is a good practice to react 2 moles of an aldehyde of formula III above with one mole of acetone in an aqueous alcohol in the presence of an alkali metal base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide at a temperature range of 100C to 400C, preferably at from 20 C to 250C, for a period of time ranging from one to three hours, or until the condensation reaction is essentially complete to afford the corresponding pentadienone IV .Next, the thus obtained pentadienone is condensed with an equimolar or even a slight excess amount of a salt of the appropri ate hydrazine V in an alcohol at 500C to 800C or at the boiling point of said alcohol for a period of time of one to five hours or until the condensation reaction is essen tially complete to yield the salt of a formula IA penta dienone hydrazone. The alcohols used in the above reaction sequences are illustratively methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and mixtures thereof. The pentadienone hydrazone may be recovered from the above salt, if desired, by treating said salt with a dilute aqueous solution of an inorganic base, such as sodium or Dotassium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or triethylamine. The compounds of the present invention find utility in the control of insects and ants, Family Formicidae, by contacting said insects with, and or applying to their habitat or food supply, an insecticidally effective amount of a compound of formulas I and II hereinabove defined. Further, the compounds find utility in protecting agronomic crops, trees, shrubs, ornamentals and the like from attack by insects, by applying to the crops an insecticidally effective amount of a compound having the above structure.In practice, generally about 0.14 kg hectare to 11.2 kg hectare, and preferably 0.56 kg hectare to 4.48 kg hectare of a pentadienone hydrazone is effective for insect control other than through the use of baits as disclosed below and or for crop protection. The formula I or II compounds of this invention can be applied in either liquid or solid form. They may be applied in solid form as dusts or dust concentrates, or in liquid form as emulsifiable concentrates, flowable thixotropic formulations or wettable powders which are dispersed in water or other inexpensive liquid for application as a finely divided spray. The formula I or II compounds may also be prepared in the form of an attractant bait which is distributed to the locus or habitat of the insects sought to be controlled. A typical emulsifiable concentrate can be prepared by admixing from about 12 to 29 by weight of acylated pentadienone hydrazone, about 8 to 12 by weight of a blend of nonionic emulsifiers such asT Mulz 339 sold byThompson Hayward of Kansas City, Kansas , or polyoxyethylene derivatives and blends with alkyl aryl sulfonates, and about 59 to 80 by weight of cyclohexanone or a heavy aromatic solvent having a mixed aniline point between loc and 35.00C, a specific gravity between 0.880 and 1.5 at 15.50 15.50C and an aromatic content of 60 to 100 . These formulations provide from 119.8 g liter to 239.6 g liter of active compound and are generally diluted with water for application as a dilute liquid. However, said formulations can also be applied in the form of undiluted discrete droplets as low volume or ultra low volume sprays.For such application, the emulsifiable concentrate is usually applied with apparatus designed to disperse the liquid in the form of finely divided discrete droplets having a mass median diameter of from 25 to 150 microns. A typical wettable powder formulation can be prepared by grinding together about 34 by weight of a synthetic calcium silicate. 12 bv weight of a dispersing agent such as sodium lignosulfonate, 4 by weight of a wetting agent such as an alkyl aryl sulfonate, and 50 by weight of a pentadienone hydrazone. Such formulation is generally dispersed in water for application as a liquid spray. It has been found that pentadienone hydrazones, as represented by the formulae set forth above, are useful for the control of insects especially a wide variety ofLepidopterous insectsThe compounds of this invention, moreover, are active against Lepidopterous larvae, such as southern armyworms ispodoptera eridania Cramer , cabbage loopers fTrichoplusia ni Huner , tobacco budworms IHeliothis virescens Fabricius , and the like, at 10 to 1000 ppm rates. They do not appear to be especially toxic to most beneficial insects and thus are useful for pest management and integrated control programs. Moreover, these compounds show virtually no phytotoxicity to plants at rates of application up to 11.2 kg hectare. Advantageously, the pentadienone hydrazone compounds of the present invention are active as stomach poisons.Thus, they are effective against insects with chewing mouth parts Orthopterous insects such as cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets and Isopterous insects such as termites as well as those with sponge and lapping mouth parts Dipterous insects such as flies . They are effective for the control of fire ants, such as the southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, the black imported fire ant, Solenopsis richteri, and the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis inticta. They are also effective for the control of ants such as the big headed ant, Pheidole magecephala, and the Argentine ant, Iridomyrmax humilis, that are dominate pests in pineapple and sugarcane fields, and for the control of many species of ants that are classified under the general category of household ants.Ants are serious economic and public health.pests. Serious problems created by fire ants include stinging of humans and livestock, feeding on plants, particularly on seedlings and on germinating seeds, damage to farm machinery that strike ant mounds, loss of crops and refusal of workers to enter infested fields to cultivate and harvest crops.Ants invade houses, crawl over food, carry bits of food to their nests and also cause damage by establishing their nests in the woodwork of houses and other wooden buildings. Control of these pests can be achieved with treated baits that are distributed in or adjacent to the infested area, such as pasture, park dwellings or other locations in which ant control is desired, and made available to worker ants. The workers carry the treated bait to the colony where it is consumed by the queens and the young ants, leading to their destruction. In practice, generally from about 1.25 g ha to 75.0 g ha, and preferably from 2.5 g ha to 37.5 g ha of acylated pentadienone hydra zone is effective for fire ant control and or for crop protection from ants and about 0.0625 to 4 by weight, and preferably 0.125 to 2.0 by weight of the acylated pentadienone hydra zone is effective for the control of house ants and or insects that are controlled by bait. Baits can be prepared, for example, by admixing said formula I compounds with peanut butter or citrus pulp, vegetable oils such as soybean oil, animal fats such as lard and tallow, and with or without an organic filler such as bran, and or an attractant such as lecithin.The composition is then placed in soda straws or on a carrier such as puffed grain, corncob grits and or starch matrix and distributed in the area of the colony or infestation. Use of these baits has particular advantage, since such method of distribution poses little or no hazard to nontarget organisims that may frequent the infested area. The invention is further illustrated by the examples set forth below which are provided only by way of illustration and are not deemed to be limiting thereof. Unless otherwise noted, all parts are by weight.

The activity of the hereinabove compounds of this invention is demonstrated by the following tests, wherein pentadienone hydra zones are evaluated against test insect species at rates ranging from 10 to 1000 ppm. Test formulations and procedures used for evaluation are as follows Test FormulationsA. 100 Mg of the test material is weighed, placed in a funnel over a 113 g narrow mouth bottle, and rinsed into the bottle with a 35 ml scoop of acetone, followed by a scoop of water and another scoop of acetone to yield 1000 ppm in 65 acetone. If the material is not soluble, it is broken up with a glass rod and used as a suspension.B. This stock solution A is used to make 300 ppm solu tions or suspensions by pipetting 30 ml of A into a bottle containing 70 ml of 50 acetone to yield 300 ppm. Further dilutions in 50 acetone are made as required.C. Tests requiring 10 ppm in acetone solutions 1 ml of A is pipetted into 99 ml of acetone to yield 10 ppm. Additional dilutions are made using 50 acetone as re quired.Initial TestsTobacco Budworm Heliothis virescens Fabricius . A cotton pkant with 2 true leaves expanded is dipped for 3 seconds with agitation in 300 ppm solution. A 1.27 to 1.91 cm squire of cheesecloth with about 50 to 100 budworm eggs 0 24 hours old is also dipped in the test solution and placed on a leaf of the cotton plant, all being placed in the hood to dry. The leaf with the treated budworm eggs is removed from the plant and placed in a 236.6 ml 8 oz dixie cup with a wet 5 cm piece of dental wick and covered with a lid. The other leaf is placed in a similar cup with a wick and a piece of cheesecloth infested with 50 100 newly hatched larvae is added before covering the cup with a lid. After 3 days at 26.70C, 50 r.h., observations of egg hatch are made, as well as kill of newly hatched larvae, any inhibition of feeding, or interference of any sort with normal development.Southern Armyworm Spodoptera eridania Cram er . A Sieva lima bean plant with just the primary leaves expanded to 1.91 cm is dipped for 3 seconds with agitation in the A solution of 1000 ppm and set in the hood to dry. Following this, one leaf is placed in a 9 cm petri dish which contains a moist filter paper in the bottom and 10 third instar armyworm larvae about 1 cm long. This dish is covered and held at 26.70C, and 50 RH. After 2 days, mortality counts and estimates of the amount of feeding are made. Compounds showing partial kill and or inhibition of feeding are held for an extra day for further observations.Those materials which produce greater than 75 mortality, or which show only trace feeding damage are further tested. All compounds showing activity as defined above are retested, using the second leaf on the bean plant, after an interval of 7 days from original treatment, as an assay of residual activity.Secondary TestsTobacco Budworm Heliothis virescens Fabricius Third Instar. Three cotton plants with just expanded cotyledons are dipped in 1000 ppm solution and placed in the hood to dry. When dry, each cotyledon is cut in half, and each half is placed in one of ten 29.6 ml plastic medicine cups containing a 1.25 cm dental wick saturated with water and one third instar budworm larva is added. The cup is capped and held for 3 days at 26.70C, 50 r.h., after which mortality counts are made. Compounds killing more than 75 of the larbae are further tested. Cabbage Looper Tr ichoplusia ni Hibner Third Instar. A true leaf of a cotton plant is dipped into the test solution, agitated for 3 seconds, and removed to dry in an exhaust hood.

Mortality counts are made after 3 days at 26.70C, and 50 10 r.h. Compounds killing more than 75 of the loopers are further tested. Imported Fire Ant Bait Toxicant Tests Solenopsis invicta Buren Test Procedure Tests are conducted in 30 ml disposable plastic medicine cups 40 mm ID at the top, tapering to 32 mm ID at the bottom, 38 mm high . A hole 6 mm diam. is drilled through the bottom of each cup and a layer of plaster ofParis and builders cement 9 1 ratio poured over the bottom. The plaster mixture covers the hole and acts as a wick to draw up water when the cup is placed on a 8 mm thick foam rubber pad saturated with water. The cups are placed in a tray and covered by another tray inverted to prevent rapid evaporation of water from the foam pad.Moisture is necessary to keep the humidity in the cups high and thereby prevent disiccation of the ants. The cement is added to make a hard mixture through which the ants cannot tunnel and escape. Twenty worker ants from field collected colonies are placed in each test chamber ca. 24 hr preceding the start of the test. This pretreatment holding period allows time for recovery of the ants from handling and for orientation to the containers. Candidate chemicals are dissolved directly in the food material e.g., soybean oil. The toxic solution is offered to the ants on cotton swabs saturated with the material and placed in the test chamber in small vial caps.Preliminary tests are conducted at concentrations of 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01 percent. The ants are allowed to feed as desired on the toxic bait for 24 hr. After this exposure period, the toxicant is removed from the chamber and the ants remain without food for an additional 24 hr. At the end of this time. new vial caps containinq cotton swabs saturated with soybean oil are placed in the chamber and left for the remainder of the test period. Knockdown and mortality counts are made at intervals of 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 14 days following initial exposure. Each test consists of 3 replications. Room temperature is maintained at 23.9 i 10C. Data obtained are reported in Table IV below. TABLE IV EVALUATE OF PENDADIKNONE HYDRAZONES AS INSECTICIDES Percens Mortslity.
