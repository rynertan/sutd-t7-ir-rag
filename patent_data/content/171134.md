# SELECTIVELY REMOVABLE PROSTHETIC NAIL

## Abstract
A selectively removable prosthetic nail adapted for use on one of the digits of a person s hand or foot includes a nail plate 12 comprising a sheet having a front 14 and rear 16 ends and a longitudinal axis extending therebetween. A bifurcated anchor member 26 extends downwardly from near the front end of the nail plate the member has two legs 28, 30 with proximal 36, 38 and distal 32, 34 portions. The distal portions 32, 34 of the legs have a rest condition at which they are spaced apart appreciably further than are their proximal portions, and the distal portions are susceptible of being temporarily brought together so that their distal portions are essentially as close as are their proximal portions. The two legs preferably lie in a transverse plane where they are exposed to being externally gripped by tweezers or the like from the front of the nail plate. The nail plate is held in place on a digit when the distal portions of the legs are in their rest condition and when they are in contact with a pocket of tissue on the forward end of a person s digit. When the distal portions of the legs are temporarily brought together, the anchor member may be lifted vertically away from the person s nail bed without damaging the pocket of tissue. When desired, the prosthetic nail may be replaced on the digit without any new surgery, and may even be replaced at home by the wearer.
