# Optical fibre connector.

## Abstract
The connector ensures the alignment between the two fibres ends 9, 10 thanks to the force exerted by a locally generated magnetic field 5, 6, 7, 8 on a ferromagnetic fluid placed between the side fibre surface and a small tube 1 with a diameter greater than fibre diameter.
