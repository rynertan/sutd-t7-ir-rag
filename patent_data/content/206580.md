# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTERCONNECTING PROCESSORS IN A HYPER DIMENSIONAL ARRAY

## Abstract
A massively parallel processor is described comprising 65,534 2¹⁶ individual processors organized so that there are 16 2⁴ individual processors on each of 4,096 2¹² integrates circuits 120 . The integrated circuits are intercon nected in the form of a Boolean cube of 12 dimensions for routing of message packets. Each circuit board carries 32 2⁵ integrated circuits and each backplane 140 carries 16 2⁴ circuit boards 100 . There are eight 2³ backplanes 140 advantageously arranged in a cube that is 2 2 2. Each inte grated circuit 120 on a circuit board 100 is connected to five integrated circuits 120 on the same board 100 which are its nearest neighbors in the first five dimensions. Further, each integrated circuit 120 is also connected to four other integrated circuits 120 on different circuit boards 100 , but on the same backplane 140 . Finally, each integrated circuit 120 is also connected to three other integrated circuits 120 , each on a different backplane 140 . As a result of this arrangement, all message packets are first routed to nearest neighbor ICs located on the same circuit board all message packets are then routed to nearest neighbor ICs located on the same backplane 140 and finally, all message packets are then routed to nearest neighbor ICs located on different backplanes 140 .
