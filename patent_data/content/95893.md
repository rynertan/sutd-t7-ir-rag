## Description
The present invention relates to a polyamide elastomer consisting essentially of a segmented polyether ester amide and more particularly to a polyamide elastomer which exhibits superior rubber elasticity, mechanical strength and moldability over a wide temperature range from low to high temperatures. Polyether ester amide block copolymers are known that they are thermoplastic elastomers having superior impact resistance and rubber elasticity like polyether esters and polyether amides. For example, a polyether ester amide comprising polydodecaneamide nylon 12 as hard segment and poly tetramethylene oxide glycol as polyether component is presently available commercially. This block copolymer is superior in flexibility and impact resistance at low temperatures, but its high temperature characteristics and oil and chemicals resistance are not satisfactory. Especially at a high temperature region not lower than 100 C, a conspicuous deterioration is observed with respect to elastic modulus and strength, and at temperatures not lower than 120 C it is substantially impossible to use such commercially available polyether ester amide. In an attempt to improve high temperature characteristics of polyether ester amide there has been proposed one which employs polycapramide nylon 6 as hard segment. But the affinity of nylon 6 for such a polyether as poly tetramethylene oxide glycol is low and so its copolymerizable composition range is limited besides, it is necessary that the caprolactam should be distilled out of the reaction system during melt polymerization, thus it being difficult to produce on an industrial scale a polyether ester amide of a desired composition and of a high polymerization degree. Under the circumstances, with such polyether ester amide using nylon 6 as hard segment, an elastomer superior in both flexibility and high temperature characteristics has not been obtained yet. In the case of a soft type polyether ester amide using nylon 6 as hard segment and containing a larger amount of polyether component, the deterioration of crystallinity is conspicuous and also from this point it is difficult to attain both high temperature characteristics and flexibility. There has been proposed a process for preparing a polyether ester amide by reacting a dicarboxylic polyamide nylon 6 12 component , obtained from hexamethylene diamine dodecanoate and adipic acid, with polytetramethylene glycol U.S.P. 4,230,838 . Polyether ester amides are also described in DE A 2135770, where a polyamide composition comprises as an antistatic agent a minor amount of the reaction product of a polyalkylene ether ester with a polyamide or polyamide forming reactant. However, most of the polyether ester amides concretely disclosed hitherto using as hard segment a polyamide in which the total number of carbon atoms of diamine and dicarboxylic acid is not less than 16 have melting points lower than 160 C. Even a polyether ester amide having a melting point higher than 160 C, the elastic recovery is low and the tensile strength at elevated temperatures, for instance, 120 C or more is lower than 50 kg cm². Therefore, they are unsuitable for use in automobile hose or the like. It is an object of the present invention to eliminate the aforementioned disadvantages of conventional polyamide elastomers. It is another object of the present invention to provide a thermoplastic elastomer which retains superior flexibility and impact resistance at low temperatures as well as a superior moldability and which further exhibits a high mechanical strength and rubbery properties even at a high temperature region of 100 to 150 C. According to the present invention there is provided a polyether ester amide comprising polyamide segments and polyether ester segments and characterised in that it consists essentially of about 5 to 50 weight per cent of polyamide segment A and about 95 to 50 weight per cent of polyether ester segment B , and having a melting point not lower than 160 C, a Shore hardness in the range of 80A to 45D, a tensile modulus in the range of 100 to 2100 kg cm² and an elastic recovery of 50 elongation of not less than 70 . The above polyether ester amides may be obtained by charging into a vessel capable of being heated both a substantially equimolar amount of at least one aliphatic diamine A 1 having at least 6 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid A 2 selected from the group consisting of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having an even number of carbon atoms which is at least 6, terephthalic acid and hexahydroterephthalic acid, or a salt formed from said aliphatic diamine A 1 and said dicarboxylic acid A 2 , and a substantially equimolar amount of a poly alkylene oxide glycol B 1 and a dicarboxylic acid B 2 being either the same dicarboxylic acid as dicarboxylic acid A 2 or being terephthalic acid, said poly alkylene oxide glycol B 1 having a ratio of carbon atom number to oxygen atom number of not less than 2.3 and having a number average molecular weight in the range of 500 to 3000, followed by heating for homogenization at a temperature in the range of 150 C to 260 C under stirring and In the polyether ester amide of the present invention, the polyamide hard segment is obtained from an aliphatic diamine A 1 having at least 6 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid A 2 selected from aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, having an even number of carbon atoms which is at least 6 terephthalic acid and hexahydroterephthalic acid, provided the total number of carbon atoms of the diamine and the dicarboxylic acid is from 16 to 19. More particularly, the following polyamide units are preferred It goes without saying that a small amount of a copolymerizable component may be contained in such polyamide hard segment within the limits of not preventing the objects of the present invention. Examples of copolymerizable component in the above polyamide unit 1 include aliphatic diamine units such as hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine and decamethylenediamine, and dicarboxylic acid units such as adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid and isophthalic acid. Examples of copolymerizable component in the above polyamide unit 2 include diamine units such as heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, undecamethylenediamine, bis p aminocyclohexyl methane and xylylenediamine, and dicarboxylic acid units such as adipic acid, azelaic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and hexahydroterephthalic acid. Further, examples of copolymerizable component in the above polyamide unit 3 include dicarboxylic acid units such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, hexahydroterephthalic acid, 5 sodium sulfoisophthalic acid, dimer acid and dodecadionic acid, and diamine units such as hexamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis p aminocyclohexyl methane and xylylenediamine. In the polyether ester amide of the present invention, as one constituent of the polyether ester soft segment, there is used a poly alkylene oxide glycol having a ratio of carbon atom number to oxygen atom number of not less than 2.3 and a number average molecular weight in the range of 500 to 3000. The number average molecular weight of poly alkylene oxyde glycols may range from 500 to 3000 but an optimum molecular weight region is selected so as to give superior high and low temperature characteristics and mechanical properties without causing a gross phase separation during polymerization. Such optimum molecular weight region differs according to the kind of poly alkylene oxide glycol. The preferable number average molecular weight of poly alkylene oxide glycols ranges from 500 to 2,500. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the melting point of the resultant polymer. As poly alkylene oxide glycols having a ratio of carbon atom number to oxygen atom number of not less than 2.3 are exemplified poly 1,2 and 1,3 propylene oxide glycols, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol, poly hexamethylene oxide glycol, block or random copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and block or random copolymer of ethylene oxide and tetrahydrofuran. Especially, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol is preferred in view of superior physical properties of the polyether ester amide such as superior thermal stability, water resistance, mechanical strength and elastic recovery. In order to obtain polyether ester amides having the physical properties required to be industrially effective as the other constituent of the polyether ester soft segment in the polyether ester amide of the present invention a dicarboxylic acid B 2 is used which is either the same dicarboxylic acid as dicarboxylic acid A 2 or terephthalic acid. Examples of such dicarboxylic acid include adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid and dimer acid. The polyether ester amides of the present invention must have the following physical properties. It is necessary for that that the polyamide unit and the polyether ester unit be copolymerized at a ratio by weight of 5 50 95 50 and so that the resultant copolymer has the following values of physical properties Particularly, it is preferable that the polyether ester soft segment be copolymerized in the range of 50 to 90, most preferably 55 to 80 by weight based on the total weight of polyether ester amide. Ratios of the polyether ester component exceeding 95 are not desirable because the length of the polyamide hard segment in the resulting polyether ester amide would become too small, leading to deterioration in physical properties of the copolymer. This copolymer not only is flexible and superior in rubber elasticity at room temperature and thereabout, but also exhibits superior physical properties and moldability as elastomer over a wide temperature range from low to high temperatures. Among the foregoing items of physical properties of the copolymer, it is the item of melting point that is most important in defining high temperature characteristics mainly aimed at by the present invention. Though the high temperature properties depend not only on the melting point but also on the degree of crystallinity, the form of crystal and the perfectness of crystal, but generally the copolymer should be designed so as to exhibit a melting point not lower than 160 C, preferably not lower than 180 C. Although the process for preparing the polyether ester amide of the present invention is not specially limited, a particularly superior process comprises the step of charging into a vessel capable of being heated a substantially equimolar amount of at least one aliphatic diamine A 1 and an dicarboxylic acid A 2 , or a salt formed from A 1 and A 2 , the choice of A 1 and A 2 being such that the total number of carbon atoms of A 1 and A 2 is from 16 to 19, and a substantially equimolar amount of a poly alkylene oxyde glycol B 1 having a ratio of carbon atom number to oxygen atom number of not less than 2.3 and a number average molecular weight in the range of 500 to 3000 and a dicarboxylic acid B 2 , and applying heat at 150 260 C under stirring to allow homogenization to take place, and the step of heating the homogenized reaction mixture at 220 300 C under a high vacuum of not more than 15 mmHg 2 kPa , preferably not more than 5 mmHg 0.7 kPa and more preferably not more than 1 mmHg 0.13 kPa to allow polycondensation to take place to obtain a copolymer consisting essentially of about 5 to 50 by weight of polyamide segment and about 95 to 50 by weight of polyether ester segment. The term homogeneous as referred to herein does not always mean a commingled state on a molecular order, but includes a state free from phase separation or the like as a whole even in a whitely turbid state in appearance. According to the above process, the polyether ester amide block copolymer of the present invention can be prepared industrially advantageously as a colorless polymer having a high degree of polymerization. The most typical combinations of A 1 and A 2 include a combination of hexamethylenediamine and sebacic acid or dodecanedioic acid, a combination of undecamethylene diamine and or dodecamethylene diamine and a carboxylic acid selected from adipic acid, suberic acid, terephthalic acid and hexahydroterephthalic acid. The upper limit of the total carbon number can be determined according to whether the melting point of the polymer obtained is over 160 C or not but is not greater than 19. But the polyamide forming components may be fed directly to the aforementioned reaction system without being formed into salt beforehand, and, in this case it is necessary to control the reaction conditions in the dissolving and homogenizing step so as to prevent the amine from being distilled out of the reaction system. There also may be adopted a method in which a dicarboxylic acid terminated polyamide prepolymer is formed in advance from the amine forming and dicarboxylic acid components and a poly alkylene oxide glycol is reacted therewith. But in this case, it is essential that the dicarboxylic acid as a constituent of the polyether ester unit be either identical with the dicarboxylic acid as a constituent of the polyamide unit, or terephthalic acid. Otherwise, the polyamide hard segment will be random copolymerized, thus making it impossible to obtain a soft elastomer superior in high temperature characteristics aimed at in the present invention. Preferable examples of catalyst which may be used in the polymerization reaction for preparing the polyether ester amide of the invention include titanium type catalysts such as tetraalkyl titanates, e.g. tetrabutyl titanate, and titanium oxalate metallic salts, e.g. potassium titanium oxalate tin type catalysts such as dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin laurate and monobutyltin oxide zirconium tetraalkoxide type catalysts such as zirconium tetrabutoxide and zirconium isopropoxide hafnium tetraalkoxide type catalysts such as hafnium tetraethoxide and lead type catalysts such as lead acetate. These compounds as polymerization catalysts accelerate the reaction and are useful in easily preparing the colorless copolymer of the invention having superior physical properties and a high degree of polymerization. There also may be incorporated polyfunctional compounds such as trimesic acid, glycerin and pentaerythritol provided there should not occur gelation. The polymerization degree of the polyether ester amide of the present invention, which differs according to the use, purpose and the molding method, should be not less than 1.5, preferably not less than 1.7, in terms of a relative viscosity ηr in solution determined under the conditions of 0.5 concentration and 25 C in orthochlorophenol. In the polyether ester amide block copolymer of the present invention there may be incorporated heat and light resisting stabilizers such as an anti oxidant, a thermal decomposition inhibitor and an ultraviolet ray absorber, during polymerization or before molding after polymerization. Examples of heat resisting stabilizers include various hindered phenols such as 4,4 bis 2,6 di tert butylphenol , 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene, tetrakis methylene 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane and N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamamide aromatic amines such as N,N bis β naphthyl p phenylenediamine and 4,4 bis 4 α,α dimethylbenzyl diphenylamine sulfur compounds, e.g. dilaurylthiodipropionate, and phosphorus compounds, as well as alkaline earth metal oxides, nickel salts of Schiff bases, cuprous iodide and or potassium iodide. As examples of light stabilizers, mention may be made of substituted benzophenones, benzotriazoles, and piperidine compounds such as bis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidine sebacate and 4 benzoyloxy 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine. Furthermore, the polyether ester amide block copolymer of the present invention may contain a hydrolytic stabilizer, a coloring agent e.g. pigment or dye , an antistatic agent, a conducting agent, a flame retardant, a reinforcing material, a filler, a lubricant, a nucleating agent, a releasing agent, a plasticizer, an adhesive aid, a tackifier, etc. The following examples are given to further illustrate the invention, in which the parts represent parts by weight unless otherwise specified. 42.32 parts of nylon 6 12 salt dry product prepared from hexamethylenediamine and dodecanedioic acid, 46.68 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 680 and 15.79 parts of dodecanedioic acid were charged, together with 0.20 part of Irganox 1098 antioxidant N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di t butylhydroxyhydrocinnamide and 0.05 part of a tetrabutyl titanate catalyst, into a reaction vessel equipped with a helical ribbon agitation blade, which was then purged with nitrogen gas. After subsequent heating at 240 C for 40 minutes under stirring to obtain a substantially transparent, homogeneous solution, there were created polymerization conditions of 270 C and 0.5 mmHg 66 Pa according to a heat up and pressure reducing program, under which conditions a polymerization reaction was allowed to take place for 4.5 hours to give a viscous, colorless, transparent, molten polymer exhibiting an agitation torque of 5.0 kg cm at 22 rpm. The polymer was discharged in the form of strand into water to obtain a flexible, transparent and non sticky strand. The polyether ester amide I thus obtained had a relative viscosity ηr of 1.72 determined at 25 C, 0.5 concentration in orthochlorophenol, and its melting point Tm and crystallization temperature Tc according to DSC proved to be 205 C and 168 C, respectively. Also in the following Examples and Comparative Examples the values of ηr, Tm and Tc will be determined in this way . The polymer was compression molded into sheets. The resultant article proved to have such mechanical properties as shown in Table 1 below. It was flexible and had rubber elasticity. Polymerization was carried out under the same conditions as in Example 1 except that 42.55 parts of nylon 6 10 salt prepared from hexamethylenediamine and sebacic acid, 48.23 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 680 and 14.33 parts of sebacic acid were used as starting materials. An agitation torque of 5 kg cm 22 rpm was reached in the polymerization time of 6 hours. The resultant polyether ester amide II was translucent in molten state, and main physical properties thereof were as follows Using as starting materials 26.45 parts of nylon 12 6 salt prepared from dodecamethylenediamine and adipic acid, 64.56 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 13.86 parts of adipic acid, heating was performed at 240 C under stirring in the same way as in Example 1 to give a homogeneous, transparent solution. Thereafter, polymerization was allowed to take place at 270 C for 8 hours to obtain a polyether ester amide III as a transparent, viscous polymer, properties of which were as follows 25.806 parts of dodecamethylenediamine, 29.928 parts of adipic acid and 51.646 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 were charged into a polymerization tube, followed by heating at 200 C for 45 minutes under stirring, to give a completely transparent, homogeneous solution. Subsequently, polymerization was allowed to take place under a high vacuum of 0.3 mmHg 40 Pa at 255 C for 2 hours and further at 275 C for 2 hours to afford a polyether ester amide V as a transparent, viscous, molten polymer, which proved to have the following properties Using as starting materials nylon 11 6 salt, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 and adipic acid, there was prepared a polyether ester amide VI consisting of 50 wt. of nylon 11 6 units and 50 wt. of polyether ester units. This polymer VI proved to have the following properties 33.4 parts of undecamethylenediamineterephthalate nylon 11 T salt prepared from undecamethylenediamine and terephthalic acid, 58.3 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 14.9 parts of terephthalic acid were charged, together with 0.20 part of N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di t butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamide antioxidant trade name Irganox 1098 and 0.05 part of a tetrabutyl titanate catalyst, into a reaction vessel equipped with a helical ribbon agitation blade, which was then purged with nitrogen gas. After subsequent heating at 240 C for 40 minutes under stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution, there were created polymerization conditions of 280 C and 0.5 mmHg 66 Pa according to a heat up and pressure reducing program, under which conditions a polymerization reaction was allowed to take place for 3.5 hours to give a colorless, translucent, viscous, molten polymer exhibiting an agitation torque of 50 kg cm at 22 rpm. The polymer was discharged in the form of strand into water to obtain a flexible, non sticky strand. The ηr and Tm of the polyether ester amide VI thus obtained were 1.84 and 230 C, respectively. The polymer was compression molded. The resultant article proved to have such mechanical properties as shown in Table 2. It was flexible and had rubber elasticity and exhibited a high mechanical strength even at high temperatures. Using as starting materials 38.2 parts of aminododecanoic acid, 54.2 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol and 13.9 parts of terephthalic acid, a polyether ester amine VI was prepared under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 6. The ηr and Tm of this polyether ester amide were 1.81 and 138 C, respectively. As shown in Table 2 below, in the temperature region from low to normal temperature, the polymer exhibited superior mechanical properties like the polymer prepared in Example 6, but at higher temperature its elastic modulus and strength deteriorated to a large extent, and at 120 C the polymer almost flowed. Using as starting materials 44.6 parts of undecamethylenediamine terephthalate, 50.0 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 12.8 parts of terephthalic acid, there was prepared a polyether ester amide VII in the same way as in Example 6, whose physical properties were as follows Using as starting materials 27.3 parts of undecamethylenediamine terephthalate, 68.6 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1,400 and 8.14 parts of terephthalic acid, there was prepared a polyether ester amide VIII in the same way as in Example 6. This product, which was translucent and extremely flexible, proved to have such physical properties as shown in Table 3. Polymerization was carried out under the same conditions as in Example 8 except that the poly tetramethylene oxide glycol used was of a number average molecular weight of 6,000, to afford a polyether ester amide VIII , which was milky like pearl during melt polymerization and inferior in physical properties see Table 3 . 17.5 parts of undecamethylenediamine and 30.8 parts of terephthalic acid were charged into a reaction vessel and heated with stirring at 160 230 C for 1 hour under a nitrogen gas stream. Then, 58.3 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650,020 part of Irganox 1098 and 0.05 part of tetrabutyl titanate were added into the reaction mixture, and polymerization was allowed to take place according to the same heat up and pressure reducing program as in Example 6. After 5 hours and 20 minutes, a target torque of 5.0 kg cm 22 rpm was reached. The ηr and Tm of the resultant polyether ester amide IX were 1.85 and 228 C, respectively. Not only in mechanical properties but also in physical properties this product was almost equal to the polyether ester amide VI prepared in Example 6. Polymerization was conducted in the same way as in Example 6 using as starting materials 33.4 parts of undecamethylenediamine terephthalate, 65.9 parts of polyether glycol from copolymerization of polyethylene oxide and polytetrahydrofuran, the polyether glycol having a number average molecular weight of 2,100 and containing 30 of ethylene oxide units, and 5.2 parts of terephthalic acid, to afford a polyether ester amide X having the following physical properties Polymerization was conducted in the same way as in Example 6 using as starting materials 33.4 parts of undecamethylenediamine cyclohexanedicarboxylate prepared in advance from undecamethylenediamine and cyclohexane 1,4 dicarboxylic acid 58.3 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 15.3 parts of cyclohexane 1,4 dicarboxylic acid, to afford a polyether ester amide XI having the following physical properties 33.5 parts of hexamethylenediamine dodecanedioate nylon 612 salt prepared from hexamethylenediamine and dodecanedioic acid, 53.9 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 19.1 parts of dodecanedioic acid were charged, together with 0.20 part of N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamide antioxidant trade name Irganox 1098 and 0.05 part of a tetrabutyl titanate catalyst, into a reaction vessel equipped with a helical ribbon agitation blade, followed by heating with stirring at 230 C for 1 hour under a nitrogen gas atmosphere to give a homogeneous solution. Thereafter, polymerization conditions of 270 C and 0.5 mmHg 66 Pa were created according to a heat up and pressure reducing program, under which conditions a polymerization reaction was allowed to take place for 4 hours and 10 minutes to obtain a colorless, transparent, viscous, molten polymer. The polymer was discharged in the form of strand into water to afford a flexible, non sticky strand. The ηr and Tm of the polyether ester amide XII thus obtained were 1.82 and 193 C, respectively. A compression molded article from the polymer proved to have such mechanical properties as shown in Table 4. It was flexible and had rubber elasticity and exhibited a superior mechanical strength even at high temperature. Using as starting materials 38.2 parts of aminododecanoic acid, 50.1 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol and 17.7 parts of dodecanedioic acid, there was prepared a polyether ester amide XII under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 12. The ηr and Tm of this polyether ester amide were 1.80 and 139 C, respectively. As shown in Table 4, this product was superior in mechanical properties in the temperature region from low to normal temperature like the product of the invention prepared in Example 12, but at higher temperatures its tensile modulus and strength deteriorated to a large extent, and at 120 C it almost flowed. 34.8 parts of hexamethylenediamine adipate nylon 66 salt , 59.9 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 13.5 parts of adipic acid were polymerized in the same manner as in Example 12. As a result, there occurred a gross phase separation and a brownishly turbid polymer resulted, whose polymerization degree, elastic recovery and strength were all low. Using as starting materials nylon 6 12 salt, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol PTMG 650 having a number average molecular weight of 650 and terephthalic acid, there were prepared three kinds of polyether ester amide block copolymers XIII , XIV and XV under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 12. Table 5 shows physical properties of these polymers. A polyether ester amide XVI was prepared under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 12 except that there were used 27.9 parts of nylon 6 12 salt, 66.4 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 and 11.1 parts of terephthalic acid. In the polymerization time of 3 hours and 55 minutes there was attained a high degree of polymerization reaching a predetermined torque, and a polymer of a light white color was obtained. This polymer, having a hard soft segment ratio of 25 75, proved to have the following physical properties Polymerization was conducted so as to give a hard soft segment ratio of 60 40 in Example 16. The resultant polymer was turbid in milky white and formed a gross phase separation. The polymer when discharged from the polymerization vessel exhibited a great Barus effect and it was impossible to take up the polymer as strand. The melting point of the polymer thus obtained was 205 C. But the elastic recovery was only 57 and the tensile strength at 120 C was quite low. Using as starting materials 27.9 parts of nylon 6 12 salt, 71.1 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol and 4.7 parts of dodecanedioic acid, the preparation of a polyether ester amide having the same hard soft ratio as that in Example 16 was tried, but the resultant polymer presented a pearl like milky white color and formed a gross phase separation. This polymer, which was difficult to take up as strand, was pelletized and measured for physical properties as a pressed sheet as a result, at 23 C it exhibited a tensile strength of 130 kg cm² and an elongation at break of 340 , but at 80 C it scarcely exhibited strength. 27.9 parts of nylon 6 12 salt and 11.1 parts of terephthalic acid were charged into a polymerization vessel and heated with stirring at 230 250 C for 2 hours under a nitrogen gas stream, then 66.4 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1,000, 0.05 part of tetrabutyl titanate and 0.20 part of Irganox 1098 were added into the reaction mixture, and subsequently there were created the same polymerization conditions as in Example 12. As a result, after 5 hours and 30 minutes, a predetermined torque was reached. Physical properties of this polymer are set out in Table 6. 27.9 parts of nylon 6 12 salt, 9.9 parts of adipic acid and 67.6 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1,000 were used as starting materials in Example 17. Even after the lapse of 8 hours of polymerization, a predetermined torque was not reached and the polymer became brownish, so taken out and evaluated. This polymer, whose physical properties are shown in Table 6, proved to be low in melting point and inferior in high temperature characteristics. A polyether ester amide was prepared under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 12 except that 28.2 parts of nylon 6 12 salt, 62.5 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 16.0 parts of terephthalic acid were used as starting materials. The polymer proved to have the following physical properties 39.3 parts of undecamethylenediamine adipate nylon 11 6 salt prepared in advance from undecamethylenediamine and adipic acid, 54.2 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 13.8 parts of terephthalic acid were charged, together with 0.20 part of N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamide antioxidant trade name Irganox 1098 and 0.05 part of a tetrabutyl titanate catalyst, into a reaction vessel equipped with a helical ribbon agitation blade, and heated with stirring at 230 C for 1 hour under a nitrogen gas stream to give a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, there were created polymerization conditions of 280 C and 0.5 mmHg 66 Pa according to a heat up and pressure reducing program, under which conditions a polymerization reaction was allowed to take place for 2 hours to afford a colorless, transparent, viscous, molten polymer. The polymer was discharged in the form of strand into water from the lower portion of the polymerization vessel as a result, it whitened and became a flexible, non sticky strand. The ηr and Tm of the polyether ester amide XII thus obtained were 1.75 and 204 C, respectively. A press molded article from the polymer proved to have such mechanical properties as shown in Table 7. It was flexible and had rubber elasticity and exhibited a superior mechanical strength even at high temperatures. For comparison with Example 19 in which the polyether ester amide contained 35 wt. of nylon 11 6 as hard segment, there were prepared five kinds of polymers respectively containing as hard segment nylon 12, nylon 66, nylon 6, nylon 12 12 and nylon 11 12 and having the same composition and content of soft segment, under the same conditions. As to nylon 12 and nylon 6, the respective corresponding aminocarboxylic acids were used, while the others were used as nylon salts. The state of polymerization and physical properties of the polymers are shown in Table 7. Polymerization was conducted in just the same manner as in Example 19 except that the copolymerization ratio of nylon 11 6 salt, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol PTMG 650 having a number average molecular weight of 650 and terephthalic acid was changed so as to give hard soft ratios of 30 70 and 40 60. Physical properties of the polymers thereby obtained are shown in Table 8 below. Using as starting materials nylon 11 6 salt, poly tetramethylene oxide glycols respectively having number average molecular weights of 800 and 1,000 and terephthalic acid, there were prepared polyether ester amide block copolymers XXII and XXIII having a hard soft ratio of 30 7O, physical properties of which are as shown in Table 9 below. A polymerization reaction was carried out under the same conditions as in Example 19 except that 44.9 parts of nylon 11 6 salt, 51.3 parts of poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 650 and 12.1 parts of adipic acid were used as starting materials. The polymer thereby obtained, corresponding to the polymer of Example 21 except change of the dicarboxylic acid component from terephthalic acid to adipic acid, proved to have such physical properties as shown in Table 10 below. There was tried preparation of a polyether ester amide having the same hard soft ratio as that in Example 24 except that the poly tetramethylene oxide glycol used was of a number average molecular weight of 3,500. But the polymer thereby prepared presented a pearl like milky white color and formed a gross phase separation. Its tensile strength and elongation at break at 23 C were 240 kg cm² and 300 , respectively, and thus somewhat low. At 120 C they were 18 kg cm² and 70 , respectively, and thus too low to stand use. A polyether ester amide XXV was prepared under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 19 except that 33.6 parts of nylon 11 6 salt, 65.7 parts of polypropylene glycol containing a total of 20 of ethylene oxide blocks at both ends thereof and having a number average molecular weight of 2,000 and 5.5 parts of terephthalic acid were used as starting materials. The polymer XXV proved to have the following physical properties
