# Core material.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an iron core material, comprising a high density compression molded product of a mixture of magne tic powder of iron or iron alloy having a mean particle size of 100 µ or less and an insulating caking material such as thermosetting resins. The magnetic powder, when its mean particle size s represented by D µ and its resistivity by ρµΩ cm, is preferred to have a value of the resistivity which may satisfy the following equation
