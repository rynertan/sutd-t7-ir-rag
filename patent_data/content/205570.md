## Description
This invention relates generally to high frequency transmission lines and more particularly to planar type waveguide structures for millimeter wave applications. Guided wave transmission lines are widely used to channel the flow of high frequency electrical energy. Common examples of these transmission lines are the coaxial line, the hollow metallic waveguide and the optical fiber. All these waveguiding structures are useful in long link applications. However, in situations where the distance between the transmitting and receiving points is below a few inches, as in an integrated circuit, planar transmission lines offer an attractive alternative to these types of transmission lines. A variety of planar transmission line configurations are possible. In one type of planar transmission line, metallic conductors play a primary role in the waveguiding process. This includes the well known microstrip transmission line, the slotline, the coplanar waveguide, and coplanar strip line. In another type of planar transmission line, a dielectric strip plays a primary role in the waveguiding process. This includes the well known dielectric strip guide and the inverted strip guide, typical examples of which are respectively disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,028,643, entitled Waveguide Having Strip Dielectric Structure , which issued to T. Itoh on June 7, 1977 and U.S. Pat. 4,463,330, entitled Dielectric Waveguide which issued to T. Yoneyama on July 31, 1984. In general, all of these offer significant savings in size and weight over the non planar varieties. Further, monolithic and hybrid technologies are closely compatible with the planar configuration. Consequently, these technologies can be used to generate with higher producibility, systems which offer superior performance and enhanced reliability. When combined with high volume batch fabrication, significant cost savings can result. This invention is directed to a multi layer dielectric slab structure including a substrate layer and a guiding layer, with the substrate layer being bounded on the bottom side by a metal ground plane. A dielectric loading strip metallized on the top face comprises the top layer and forms the remainder of the structure. The layers of dielectric are primarily chosen with respect to their permittivities to keep the propagating energy away from the conductor surfaces, and thereby reduce conductor losses. Such a structure is known from document US A 4 028 643 The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1A shows a perspective view of a known prior art microstrip line Before considering the preferred embodiments of the invention, the details and limitations of known prior art structures shown in Figures 1A through 1D and 2A and 2B will first be discussed. The development of planar waveguiding structures for millimeter mm wave applications has been proceeding for about two decades. An important concept in propagating energy in a waveguide is the notion of a mode. A mode is a spatial distribution of energy across the cross section of the guiding structure. In general, a waveguiding structure can propagate several modes. Each of the modes has a characteristic cut off frequency below which the waveguiding structure will not support it. It is customary to choose the cross sectional dimensions of the waveguiding structure such that, over the frequency range of interest, only one mode will be supported. This mode is often the one with the lowest cut off frequency and is called the dominant mode and the cut off frequency for the next higher order mode represents the useful bandwidth for the waveguiding structure. Accordingly, it is customary to design structures for the widest possible bandwidth consistent with single mode operation as described above. An important consideration in the design of a planar structure is the nature and behavior of the so called substrate modes. These are undesirable parasitic modes which, if allowed to propagate, can cause severe transmission losses, especially at waveguide bends and discontinuities. Such consideration must be given attention over a wide range of geometric parameters, as well as over the entire operating frequency range. For example, in the non radiative waveguide disclosed in the above referenced U.S. Pat. 4,463,330, Yoneyama, it is now established that small gaps, due to fabrication imperfections, between the metal planes and the dielectric materials leads to radiation loss. This occurs primarily because the electric field for the dominant mode is substantially parallel to the metal planes. It is desirable to establish the polarization of the dominant mode such that the electric field is largely normal to the metal planes. This is not possible with the non radiative guide. Similarly, the strip dielectric waveguide structure of Itoh, disclosed in the above referenced U.S. Pat. 4,028,643, also has limitations. For one, its dominant mode is actually an admixture of two orthogonal polarization states. Consequently, some leakage via coupling to the parasitic substrate modes is unavoidable. Further, this coupling grows stronger as one progresses to lower frequencies since then, the difference between the guiding structure and the region external to it cannot be distinguished by the propagating energy. Additionally, the structure has no inherent mechanism for propagating direct current energy. Considering now the drawings, in the structures shown in Figure 1A through 1D, which are illustrative of known prior art, metallic strips are of primary importance in the waveguiding process. In the microstrip line of Figure 1A, a conducting strip 10 is mounted on a dielectric 11 which is coated on its bottom surface with a metallic ground plane 12. In the slotline of Figure 1B, two parallel conductors 13 are placed upon dielectric 14. In Figure 1C, a coplanar waveguide configuration is shown in which three parallel conductors 15 are placed on dielectric 16, the two outer conductive strips acting as a ground plane. In Figure 1D, coplanar conductive strips 17 are mounted on dielectric 18, but the edges of the strips are not coextensive with the edges of the dielectric slab, as they were in the slotline of Figure 1B. The microstrip structure shown in Figure 1A has proven the most versatile and successful among the prior art configurations using metallic strips. The microstrip type of transmission line has been successfully used in applications up to 60GHz, but even at those frequencies, some of the problems associated with its use are evident. In microstrip, the substrate modes are suppressed by choosing a dielectric substrate that is thin enough. At 60 GHz, a typical substrate thickness must not exceed 0.203 mm 0.008 inches . At higher frequencies, even thinner substrates must be used. The requirement of thin substrates bears important consequences for the electrical and mechanical properties of the microstrip structure. The impedance of a transmission line in microstrip is primarily determined by the ratio of the conductor strip width W, to the dielectric thickness h, i.e. W h. The value of W is bounded at the upper end by the requirement that it be small compared to the wavelength of the propagating energy at the frequency in question. The lower bound on W is determined by the accuracy and reproducibility with which a narrow line can be fabricated. These bounds in turn limit the range of line impedances available to the circuit designer. Consequently, the versatility of the structure is limited when very thin dielectric substrates are used. Another serious problem is transmission line loss. In microstrip, this loss is dominated by the ohmic losses in the metal conductors. These losses inherently increase with frequency, and in microstrip, are made to increase even more rapidly as thinner dielectric substrates are used. A third problem is related to fabrication. The thin substrates required make for very delicate in process handling. Such processing conditions can result in poor fabrication yields. A fourth problem concerns the thermal properties of the structure. Ironically, this consideration leads to the conclusion that the substrate is not thin enough. If the dielectric substrate is a semiconductor on which truly planar transmitting sources are integrated, then the heat generated within these sources would have to be removed if the device is to survive operation. Unfortunately, most electrical insulators are also thermal insulators, diamond and beryllium oxide being exceptions, and consequently, the heat generating device would be thermally isolated from a heat sink, unless the substrate was made very thin. Several attempts have been made to reduce the impact of the above drawbacks, by inserting these substrates into waveguide enclosures to form fin line and suspended substrate stripline configurations. However, these structures are limited by the dimensions of the waveguide enclosures in which they are housed. Besides, the advantages of size and weight are compromised somewhat, and the thermal problem is left unaddressed. The shortcomings of microstrip are described in Pucel, R.A., Design Considerations for Monolithic Microwave Circuits , IEEE Trans., Vol. MTT 29, no. 6, pp. 513 534, June, 1981. Planar dielectric waveguides, on the other hand, offer more convenient substrate and guide dimensions, and also have low loss. Considering now Figures 2A and 2B, in Figure 2A, a dielectric strip guide is shown in which a dielectric strip 19 is mounted on a dielectric slab 20 which is coated on its bottom surface with metallic ground plane 21. An inverted strip guide is shown in Figure 2B in which a dielectric strip 22 is sandwiched between dielectric slab 23 and metallic ground plane 24. A key feature of planar dielectric structures is that they have very low loss at frequencies where the structures of Figure 1A Figure 1D cannot be used at all. Thus, planar dielectric waveguides have been used at optical frequencies spanning the infrared to visible range. This is in part due to the outright absence of conductors or the relative remoteness of the conductor surfaces from the propagating energy. An elementary way of perceiving the guiding process is illustrated in Figure 3. If light in an optically denser medium is incident on an interface with a relatively rarer medium, then total internal reflection off the interface occurs whenever the angle of incidence ϑ in the denser medium exceeds a certain critical angle. This critical angle is characteristic of the pair of materials forming the interface. If a slab of optically dense material, e.g. glass is sandwiched by optically rarer medium e.g. air, then waveguiding is possible by total internal reflection off both interfaces. The optically dense medium is called the guiding layer the bounding rarer medium is called the cladding layer. The structure is appropriately called a slab waveguide. The planar dielectric structures of Figures 2A and 2B, however, suffer from the inherent limitation of being multi modal in that they all support at least two modes. Any attempt to realize single mode operation usually results in a mode that is too weakly bound to the structure to be of any practical use. The very close separation in the cut off frequencies between the dominant TM₀ mode and the next higher TE₀ mode forces either an acceptance of a very narrow band waveguiding structure, or a dual mode guide. The coupling between these two modes can result in high radiation loss at discontinuities and bends, as well as increased coupling to the spurious substrate modes mentioned in connection with microstrip and dielectric strip waveguide. A second disadvantage of planar dielectric structures is their extreme sensitivity to the condition of the interface. Thus, any roughness in the surfaces of the guiding or cladding media or any bubbles trapped between them during the bonding process can have a profound influence on the losses due to random scattering from these centers at the boundaries. In view of the foregoing, the details of the various embodiments of this invention will now be considered. Referring now to Figure 4, a substrate 30 whose permittivity is ε The permittivity ε The line loss in this waveguide was measured at 94GHz and was found to be only 15,75 dB m 0.4db inch , compared with a loss of 98,4 dB m 2.5db inch at that frequency for microstrip, an improvement of almost six to one. The transmission line of Figure 4 combines the wideband feature of microstrip and the low loss characteristic of planar dielectric waveguides. Like the planar dielectric waveguide, it has no sidewalls so that scattering losses are reduced. Ohmic conductor losses are reduced substantially below those in an equivalent microstrip structure, permitting operation at higher frequencies. Further, the amount by which they are reduced increases as the frequency is increased. In the example presented, the conductor losses are 56 of their microstrip contributions at 75GHz. At 100GHz, they are 33 of their microstrip contributions. This is a significant result since conductor losses are known to increase with increasing frequency. It was earlier remarked that in the planar dielectric waveguide, including the strip loaded guide, the dominant TM₀ mode is not widely separated from the TE₀ mode. The addition of metal conductors 31 and 34 in the manner shown is particularly significant in the instant invention in that the separation between these modes is widened, thus permitting single mode operation over a wider band. The actual separation is determined by the ratio The thickness of the microstrip substrate 11 of the known prior structure shown in Figure 1 is limited because of the need to suppress the spurious substrate modes, as indicated previously. The most troublesome among these modes is the TE₀ mode for a grounded dielectric slab. The structure shown in Figure 4, on the other hand, suppresses the propagation of this TE₀ mode, thus permitting the use of thicker substrates 30 at a given operating frequency than would be possible with a comparable microstrip guide. As a result, losses at waveguide bends and waveguide discontinuities will be greatly reduced. As illustrated by the foregoing example, the dimensions of the waveguide Figure 4 at the frequency range of 75 100GHz will be larger than those of a microstrip structure Figure 1 designed for that range. The choices of the guiding layer 32 thickness h, the substrate dielectric 30 thickness d Any or all of the dielectric elements 30, 32 and 33 of the structure shown in Figure 4 may be semiconductors. Another unexpected result that emerges from a consideration of the new structure, particularly when semiconductors are used, is a method for exciting the dominant mode. The conventional shunt and series excitation in microstrip line are well known. In the present guide of the present invention, however, another excitation method exists. The excitation source may be located at the interface 29 between guiding layer 32 and substrate dielectric 30 or at the interface 31 between guiding layer 32 and strip 33. The excitation source would be oriented with its current transport direction parallel to the desired direction of propagation of the energy i.e. parallel to the longitudinal axis of the strip. This method of excitation is useful because i the interface 29 or 31 is the natural location of a device integrated on a semiconductor guiding layer 32 and ii substrate 30 and strip 33 would provide dc isolation of transmission line conductors 31 and 34 from such a device. This is a convenient feature which adds to the design flexibility of the structure. In many respects, the transmission line of Figure 4 resembles microstrip with the closeness of the resemblance under the designer s control. At low frequencies, its behavior is identical to microstrip. In effect, the structure of the present invention may be viewed as a means to extend the frequency of operation of microstrip circuits without having to change the substrate thickness. Thus, a 1,778 mm 0,070 inches thick conventional microstrip configuration is only usable from dc to 14GHz while the 1,778 mm 0,070 inches compound dielectric slab in accordance with the invention and as presented in the design example above is usable from dc to 100GHz. The characteristic impedance of the transmission line shown in Figure 4 is determined primarily by the ratio of the width W of the loading strip 33 to the effective guiding layer thickness, which is always somewhat larger than the actual thickness h , when the width is small compared to the wavelength. Changes in width W can also be used to provide impedance matching and frequency filtering. For widths comparable to or larger than the wavelength, no complicated field analysis is required to define the impedance level, which is dependent on the operating frequency. However, this change need not be very large. In the design example presented, a 50 Ω line at 75GHz becomes a 64 Ω line at 100GHz. Smaller variations in impedance are possible with alternative designs at the cost of higher line loss. In the structure of Figure 4, an appreciable amount of energy is propagated in the guiding and the substrate layers 32 and 30 where no sidewall losses are manifested. A smaller proportion of energy is present in the loading strip 33. This energy, however, is subjected to sidewall scattering loss. Besides, the fields at the edge of the conducting strip 34 are relatively higher, so that the scattering losses could be greater. A solution to this problem is to taper the sides of the dielectric loading strip 33 so that its cross section is no longer rectangular. Figure 5 shows the special case of a symmetric linear taper so that loading strip 36 has the cross section of an isoceles trapezoid. The rest of the configuration is similar to that previously described with respect to Figure 4. Strip 36 rests on guiding slab layer 37 which is in turn mounted on substrate dielectric layer 38. Ground plane 39 is coated on the bottom of layer 38 while a metal cladding layer 40 is formed on the top surface of the tapered loading strip 36. A variety of other tapers may also be used for strip 36 such as concave and convex circular, concave and convex hyperbolic, exponential, etc. The technique of tapering the strip 36 has some additional latent advantages i It permits a wider range of conductor linewidths and can be realized without running into the mechanical difficulty of having to mount very thin strips edge on on the guiding layer ii The tapered sides soften the discontinuity at the strip s edge. This has the effect of focusing the energy towards the center of the strip. This focusing effect is increased if the taper is such that the slope at any point on it relative to the vertical is greater than the critical angle for that interface. The tapered sides also increase the separation between the TE₀ and TM₀ modes beyond the effect previously described. Thus, a wider operating bandwidth is permitted. Alternatively, for a given operating bandwidth, the conductor losses may be reduced even further. One of the anticipated disadvantages is the sensitivity of the propagating energy to imperfections of the tapered sides. This is expected to be more critical for high impedance narrow conductor width lines. However, such sensitivity will have a smaller impact than any corresponding effect in a competitive planar dielectric waveguide. The wide bandwidth afforded by the waveguide of this invention makes the medium ideally suited for digital transmission. Additionally, one or more of the dielectric layers 30, 32, 33 of Figure 4 may be replaced by a non reciprocal medium, including, for example, a ferroelectric or ferrimagnetic material such as Barium titanate or a ferrite. The relatively small volumes in which the propagating waves are confined would enable one to use smaller amounts of control energy, and yet maintain the control energy density energy volume at high enough levels to manipulate the guided energy. In practice, this means that one may use smaller magnetic field strengths to manipulate the high frequency energy in devices such as ferrite phase shifters and modulators as well as in circulators and isolators. The heat dissipation problem outlined earlier can be more effectively overcome by using materials, such as BeO, that are electrical insulators but thermal conductors for the substrate dielectric and or dielectric strip. Since these materials can be brought in direct contact with the power generating device, they can serve as a low thermal resistance path between the device and a heat sink. It should also be noted that semiconductor materials can be used as one of the layers such as the loading layer 33, in the transmission line structure shown in Figure 4. Semiconductor materials can be used as one or more of the layers. This even includes the guiding layer 32. Furthermore, active and passive sources can be integrated into the semiconductor. Active devices should be aligned so that their current path is colinear with the long axis of the transmission line in order that energy may be effectively coupled to and from the line. The waveguide structure of the subject invention thus has the potential for realizing complete circuit and system functions on a single semiconductor wafer in other words, it is compatible with monolithic integration. Thus what has been shown and described is a slab type of structure for a millimeter wave transmission line.
