# LIQUID LEVEL MEASUREMENT APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for measurement of a column of substan tially transparent liquid, or for the detection of the presence or absence of the substantially transparent liquid at a selected level, in a transparent, substantially cylindrical tube is disclosed. A light source directs light across the cylindrical axis of the tube. Opposite the light source with respect to the cylindrical axis of the tube is located light sensor means capable of distinguishing between light focused by the substantially transparent liquid when the liquid is present at the sensor level, and light diffused by the empty tube when the substantially transparent liquid is not present. An array of sensors provides the capability of measuring the column of liquid quantitatively.
