# Process for treating a poly arylene sulfide surface with a fluorine containing gas poly arylene sulfide compositions and articles so treated.

## Abstract
Surfaces of articles formed from poly arylene sulfide resins are conditioned for the reception of adhesives, coat ings, paints, and the like by contact with a fluorine con taining gas under conditions and for a period of time sufficient to render the surtace water wettable. The fluorine containing gas can be pure or admixed with up to about 99 volume percent inert gas.
