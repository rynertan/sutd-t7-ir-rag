# INJECTION LASERS

## Abstract
An injection laser 10 includes a plurality of contiguous semiconductor layers deposited on a substrate, one of the layers being an active layer 16 and having a lower bandgap and higher index of refraction relative to at least cladding layers 14, 20 imemdiately adajcent to the active layer. The active layer is provided with an active region 19 to permit carrier recombination and support radiation propagating under lasing conditions in a optical waveguide cavity established between transverse end facets of the laser. Means is incorporated on and into the surface of the laser to form a current confinement region to the active region. The extremities of the active region fall short of the end facets so that the regions of the active layer between the active region function as a passive waveguide for the propagating radia tion in the optical cavity. The active region is an active waveguide strip of materially smaller length than the length of the optical cavity. More than one laser cavity may be formed on the same substrate so that several active regions are formed with separate current confinement regions forming a laser array device.
