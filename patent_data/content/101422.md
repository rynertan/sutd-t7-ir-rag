# SURFACE MODIFIED ELECTRODE

## Abstract
A surface modified electrode material to act as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell or oxygen evolution in a water electrolysis cell including at least one transition element, preferably nickel or cobalt. The material is surface modified by soaking in an alkali metal containing solution. The material is removed from the solution and allowed to dry thereby forming an alkali metal containing film on the surface of the material. The material is thereafter heat treated in an oxygen containing atmosphere at a temperature in the range of 250 C to 450 C. The heat treatment at least partially decomposes the film forming a highly active catalytic layer on the surface of the electrode material. The catalytic layer includes an oxide of the transition element of the electrode material as well as an oxide of the alkali metal contained in the film.
