# A DEVICE FOR DELIVERING METERED QUANTITIES OF LIQUID PRODUCTS TO A UTILISER

## Abstract
A device for delivering metered quantities of liquid products to a utiliser 8 comprises a plunger type pump 6 and a pump control means 7 including a programmable memory of any type, such as a memory card by means of which the number of strokes of the plunger of the pump 6 and consequently the quantity of liquid delivered thereby can be determined. The pump 6 is connected at its suction side to a plurality of liquid containers 1 by a network of pipes 2 each having a controllable valve 4 the opening and closing of which can be controlled by the pump control means 7 in dependence on the programme stored in the programmable memory. A typical utiliser 8 for such device is an industrial washing machine which can thus receive metered quantities of liquid detergents and other additives in place of powders used conventionally without recourse to liquid metering devices of other type and greater complexity.
