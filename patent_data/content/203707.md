# Potted electronic components.

## Abstract
A miniaturised magnetically shielded potted electronic component such as a reed relay is manufactured by first producing a casing by etching a Âµ metal sheet to produce a casing blank together with fold lines thereon, the blank then being folded to produce a casing part 10 completed by in sulating plastics material end walls 21 located between turned over end wall sections 16, 17 integral with the casing side walls 12, 13 . The reed relay insert 24 and operating coil 25 are mounted on a lead frame 23 including pins 27, 28 and then the components are positioned within the casing 10 the lead frame 23 engaging grooves 22 in the end walls 21 . The space within the casing surrounding reed relay is then filled with a potting compound and the relay completed by removing the salvage bar 31 from the lead frame 23 .
