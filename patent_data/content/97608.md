# Turbine wheel having buckets or blades machined into the outer circumference of the wheel.

## Abstract
The buckets 30, 30a, 30b of a turbine wheel 26 are formed as a series of equally spaced, overlapping U shaped passages in the rim of a wheel blank. In the machining operation, an island 31 is left as the inner segment of the curved portion of the U and this is used in combination with labyrinth seals 41, 44 to provide a fluid seal between the inlet and the outlet portion of each bucket.
