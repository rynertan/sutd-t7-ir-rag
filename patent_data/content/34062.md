## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ETHYLIDENE DIACETATE This invention relates to a process for producing ethylidenediacetate which comprises reacting acetic anhydride with hydrogen. A process for producing ethylidenediacetate by reducing acetic anhydride with hydrogen was known. Cobalt or noble metals belonging to Group VIII of the Periodic Table as a catalyst were employed in the process. refer to Japanese PatentPublication No. 19285 1973 and USP No. 3,579,566 . When cobalt is employed as a catalyst, carbon monoxide must be present in the reaction system. In addition, in separating the resulting reaction product by distillation, volatile cobalt compounds such as cobalt carbonyl are incorporated in the product, and this makes the process unsatisfactory from industrial point of view. When noble metals belonging to Group VIII of the PeriodicTable are employed, organic phosphine, organic arsine or organic stibine must be employed with the noble metal. However, the organic phosphine, organic arsine and organic stibine are special materials and are expensive. As known by the specialists in this field, these organic compounds are readily oxidized in air to inactive materials in the reaction. In addition, on account of instability the organic compounds tend to lose coordinating ability within a relatively short time. Furthermore, since the life of these organic compounds, such as organic phosphine, organic arsine and organic stibine,is short, the industrial process employing these compounds is not economic.In addition, since these organic compounds are very toxic, the processing step employing these compounds must be controlled carefully so that the compounds are not incorporated in the object product. The present inventors carried out research to find a process for effectively synthesizing ethylidenediacetate by reducing acetic anhydride with hydrogen. As a result, we found novel catalysts for the reaction. An object of this invention is to provide a process in which ethylidenediacetate can be obtained in a high yield under mild conditions in the presence of a low concentration of catalyst. This invention relates to a process for producing ethylidenediacetate which comprises reducing acetic anhydride with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst comprising a as a main component at least one material selected from the group consisting of metals belonging to Group VIII of thePeriodic Table, compounds of the metals and mixtures thereof and b as a secondary component i at least one halide selected from the group consisting of chlorides, iodides, bromides and mixtures thereof or ii at least one material selected from the group consisting of ammonia, organic nitrogen compounds and mixtures thereof, substantially anhydrous conditions being employed.

In addition, metal polymer complexes as disclosed inCHEMTECH, 1973 Pages 560 566 and CHEMTECH, 1975 pages 117 122 can be used as a main component of the catalyst. For example, the metal polymer complexes are those in which a metal belonging to Group VIII of the Periodic Table is bonded to silica, polyvinyl chloride, or polystyrene divinylbenzeni substrate crosslinked by phosphine, silyl, an amine, pyridine or sulfido bond. Of these metals and metal compounds, palladium, iridium, ruthenium, platinum, rhodium, nickel and cobalt and compounds of these metals are preferable palladium, iridium, ruthenium, platinum and rhodium and compounds of these metals are more preferable and palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium and compounds of these metals are most preferable. The main component of the catalyst may be soluble in a reaction solution. In this case a catalytic reaction is effected in a homogeneous system. The main component may be insoluble in the reaction solution or partially soluble in the solution. In this case the reaction is effected in a heterogeneous system. The heterogeneous . system catalysts include, for example, a metal itself, compounds of the metals or a metal held on a carrier. A metal can be held on a carrier by coprecipitatlon, impregnation, blending, adsorption, and ion exchange and the like. One of the processes for holding a metal on a carrier is as follows A carrier is impregnated with a solution of a metal belonging to Group VIII of the Periodic Table or a compound of the metal. The metal or the metal compound on the carrier is reduced with formalin, hydrogen, sodium format, carbon monoxide, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, or hydrazine, and then dried. Of course, the main component may be held on a carrier by other methods. Examples of the carriers include carbon, graphite, bone black, alumina, silica, silica alumina, barium sulfate, natural or synthetic zeolite, spinel, magnesia adhered alumina, thoria, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, thorium oxide, lanthanum oxide, cerium oxide, zinc oxide, tantalum, clay, diatomaceous earth, Celite trade name of product being commercially available from Johns Manville Co. , asbestos, pumice stone, bauxite, terra abla, natural and treated terra abla, such as Super Filtrol, silicon carbite, molecular sieves, ceramic honeycomb, boria, cements, alundum, corundum, brick, talk, gypsum and the like.

The carriers may be in the form of particles having uniform or ununiform size.The carriers may be in the form of molded articles, extruded articles, ceramic bars, balls, fragments, tiles and the like. Heterogeneous system catalysts are preferred to homogeneous system catalysts, because separation and purification of the product or separation and recovery of the catalyst are easy in a heterogeneous system. Either one of i at least one halide selected from the group consisting of chlorides, bromides, iodides and mixtures thereof or ii at least one material selected from the group consisting of ammonia, organic nitrogen compounds may be used as a secondary component constituting the catalyst. Halides are preferable as a secondary component. Of halogen compounds, methyl chloride, methyl bromide and methyl iodide are more preferable, because the use of these compounds makes easy selection of corrosion resistant reactor and separation of the reaction product from the reaction mixture and purification of the reaction product. Iodides, chlorides and or bromides may be added to the reaction medium in the form of an alkyl halide, such as methyl iodide, an acid halogenide, such as acetyl iodide or hydrogen halide, such as hydrogen iodide as a secondary component. Materials which can convert to an alkyl halide, an acid halogenide or hydrogen halide can be used as a secondary component.Examples of the materials which convert to an alkyl halide, an acid halogenide or a hydrogen halide by reacting with components in the reaction medium include inorganic halides, such as alkali metal halides, such as lithium halides, sodium halides, or potassium halides alkaline earth metal halides, such calcium halides or magnesium halides metal halides, such as aluminum halides, zinc halides, copper halides, lanthalum halides, or cerium halides halogens, such chlorine, bromine or iodine phosphorus halides, such as pohsphorus trichloride, or phosphorus pentachloride and carbonyl halides, such as phosgene. Ammonia or organic nitrogen compounds employed as a secondary component ii are capable of forming a coordination compound with the main component having one or more electron pairs being capable of forming a coordination bond with the metal in the main components. The secondary component ii may be introduced to the reaction zone together with the reactants. Alternatively the secondary component ii may first be bonded to a main component and then the resulting metal complex may be introduced to the reaction zone.

II Heterocyclic compounds include, for example, pyrrole pyrrolines pyrimidine pirazine pyrazole pyrazoline pyridazine picolines, such as a picoline, ss picoline or y picoline lutidines, such as 2,6 lutidine, 2,4 lutidine collidines, such as 2,4,6 collidine benzotriazole dipyridyls, such as 2,2 dipyridyl, 4,4 dimethyl 2,2 dipyridyl, or 4triethylsilyl 2,2 dipyridyl pyridines such as pyridine, alpha aminopyridine, ss aminopyridine, 2 hydroxypyridine, methyl substituted 2 hydroxypyridine, picolinic acid, methylsubstituted picolinic acid, 2,6 dicarboxypyridine, 2 dimethylamino pyridine imidazole phenanthrolines, such as 1,10phenanthroline, 4 chloro l, lO phenanthroline, or 5 thiabentyl l,10 phenanthroline quinolines, such as quinoline, 2 dimethylamino 6 methoxyquinoline, 8 hydroxyquinoline or 2 carboxyquinoline. III Pentavalent nitrogen compounds such as ammonium acetate, ammonium propionate, triammonium phosphate, diammonium hydrogenphosphate or ammonium dihydrogenphosphate. Rate of the reduction of acetic anhydride depends on amount of the main component employed, and concentration of the secondary component. Amount of the main component employed depends on type of the catalyst employed, such as homogeneous system or heterogeneous system, and type of the reaction whether being effected in a fixed bed or fluidized bed. However, in general, the amount of the main component employed may be in the range of from 1 x 10 4 to 25 wt , preferably in the range of from 5 x 10 4 to 20 wt more preferably from 1 x 10 3 to 15 wt and most preferably from 2.5 x 10 3 to 10 wt on the basis of weight of a reaction solution in terms of metal. Amount of halides employed as secondary components employed may be in the range of from 10 3 to 15 mol, preferably 10 2 5 mol and preferably 10 1 3 mol per 1 liter of a reaction solution in terms of halogen atom. Amount of ammonia or an organic nitrogen compound employed as a secondary component may be in the range of from 10 6 to 10 mol, preferably 10 4 to 5 mol and more preferably 10 3 to 1 mol per 1 liter of a reaction solution. In practicing this invention, the reaction temperature is not critical. In general, the reaction temperature may be in the range of 200C 5000C, preferably 30 3500C, more preferably 40 2500C. The reaction pressure is kept high enough to keep the raw material s , the solvent and the product in a liquid phase and to maintain an appropriate partial pressure of hydrogen.The partial pressure of hydrogen may be in the range of 0.2 350 atm. preferably 0.5 300 atm. and more preferably 1 200 atm. However, partial pressure of hydrogen may be in the range of 0.05 1000 atm. Hydrogen used as a starting material need not necessarily have high purity. The hydrogen may contain carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen, rare gases and the like.Synthesis gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide may be used as a raw material. Carbon monoxide contained in the hydrogen tends to make the catalyst stable and to restrain side reactions and consequently assists the reaction to proceed effectively. However, hydrogen of extremely low purity is not preferred, because other gases contained in the hydrogen increase the pressure of reaction system. Therefore, hydrogen with purity below 2 mol is not preferred as a raw material.In general, hydrogen with purity above 5 mol may be used, and preferably hydrogen with purity above 10 mol may be used. Acetic anhydride employed as a raw material may be prepared as follows Acetic anhydride may be prepared by oxidization of acetaldehyde or via ketene so called Wacker process from acetic acid which may be prepared by reaction of methanol and carbon monoxide. Alternatively acetic anhydride may be prepared from methyl acetate and carbon monoxide. As mentioned above acetic acid, methyl acetate and acetaldehyde are incorporated in acetic anhydride employed as a raw material.However, incorporation of these compounds in acetic anhydride is permitted, as long as an overall balance of the process is obtained. A large amount of water is preferably avoid ed in this process because such large amount of water causes decomposition of raw materials and products. However, since commercially available hydrogen and acetic anhydride contain small amounts of water, hydrogen and acetic anhydride containing water of such low concentration are permitted in this invention. By substantially anhydrous condition is meant that water content in the reaction system is less than 10 mol on the basis of total mol of the liquid components present in the system. In general, water content less than 5 mol is preferable, and water content less than 3 mol is more preferable.When raw materials contain large amount of water, they should be dried before introducing them into the reaction system. Since acetic anhydride acts as a solvent for the reaction, another solvent is not necessary but as occasion demands,another solvent may be used. Examples of solvents include organic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, octanoic acid, phthalic acid, benzoic acid esters of organic acids, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, dimethyl adipate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, phenyl acetate, and tolyl acetate hydrocarbons, such as dodecane, hexadecane, benzene, naphthalene, and biphenyl esters of inorganic acids, such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, dibutylphenyl phosphate silicates, such as tetramethyl ortho silicate, and tetrabutyl silicate aromatic ethers, such as diphenyl ethers ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, dibutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetophenone, and benzophenone. Use of acetic acid or carboxylic esters, such as methyl acetate or mixture thereof is preferred as a solvent. The present process may be carried out by batch, semicontinuous or continuous method. When a heterogeneous system catalyst is used, the reaction can be effected in a fluidized bed or a fixed bed. In continuous process, the raw material and the catalyst are continuously introduced into the reaction zone reduction of acetic anhydride with hydrogen is effected and the reaction mixture is continuously removed from the zone.Ethylidenediacetate is separated from the reaction mixture, for example by distillation. In another embodiment, the reaction mixture containing ethylidenediacetate removed from the reaction zone is introduced into another reaction zone as it is, or alternatively after part of the components other than ethylidendiacetate are separated from the reaction mixture, the resulting reaction mixture may be introduced into another reaction zone. In the reaction zone, ethylidenediacetate may be converted to acetic acid and vinyl acetate. From the resulting mixture acetic anhydride, acetic acid and vinyl acetate may be separated by distillation, and vinyl acetate may be obtained as the product. Acetic acid obtained in this process may be esterified with methanol to form methyl acetate. The methyl acetate so obtained may be reacted with carbon monoxide to form acetic anhydride. The resulting acetic anhydride can be used in the present invention. A process for producing ethylidenediacetate from acetic anhydride by using a novel catalyst is very advantageous from commercial point of view. The following examples are given as illustrative embodiments of the invention and should not be construed as limiting its scope.

The reaction was continued for 4 hours with stirring. The reaction pressure was lowered by 30 Kg cmê during the reaction. After cooling the reaction mixture, GC analysis showed that it contained 6.31 g of ethylidenediacetate, 2.49 g of ethyl acetate and 9.33 g of acetic acid. The remainder was for the most part unreacted acetic anhydride. Example 21 The procedure of Example 20 was repeated except that 0.224 g of palladium acetate was used in place of rhodium chloride. GC analysis showed that the reaction mixture contained 4.56 g df ethylidenediacetate, 1.86 g of ethyl acetate and 6.37 g of acetic acid.Example 22 The procedure of Example 20 was repeated except that 0.314 g of ruthenium chloride was used in place of rhodium chloride and 0.400 g of 2,6 lutidine was used. GC analysis showed that the reaction mixture contained 1.70 g of ethylidenediacetate and 6.04g of ethyl acetate.Example 23 The procedure of Example 20 was repeated except that carbon monoxide was not used. GC analysis showed that the reaction mixture contained 5.87 g of ethylidenediacetate.Example 24 The procedure of Example 22 was repeated excpet that carbon monoxide was not used. GC analysis showed that the reaction mixture contained 1.56 g of ethylidenediacetate.Examples 25 34 The reactions were effected under the conditions as shown in Table 2. The partial pressure of hydrogen to that of carbon monoxide was 3 1. The results are shown in Table 2.
