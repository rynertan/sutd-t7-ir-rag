# Process for metal plating a stainless steel.

## Abstract
A process for metal plating a stainless steel comprising the first step of treating the stainless steel by a cathod electrolysis in an aqueous solution containing free HC1 in an amount at least 30g ℓ and at least one species of Ni and Co in an amount at least 0.1g ℓ the second step of metal plating the same by Ni or a Ni alloy in a weakly acidic Ni plating bath and the third step of subsequently plating the same by a noble metal, Cu or an alloy thereof.
