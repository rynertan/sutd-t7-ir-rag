# Polyglycidyl ethers, their preparation and their use in curable compositions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to polyglycidyl ethers and provides such compounds based on diphenylol C₇ to C₁₃ alkanes, and their preparation from the appropriate diphenylol alkanes. The polyglycidyl ethers may be cured with known epoxy resin curing agents and may be used as base materials for the preparation of anionic or cationic aqueous thermosetting paint binders. The polyglycidyl ethers exhibit good compatibility with aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents.
