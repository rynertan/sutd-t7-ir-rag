# Method for the manufacture of olefin polymer fibrils and polymer fibrils so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for preparing olefin polymerfibrils is disclosed. A high molecular weight ethylene polymer is dissolved in methylene chloride in a first zone 20 that is heated to develop a superatmospheric pressure. The polymer solution is fed to a second zone 30 which is maintained at atmospheric pres sure. The polymer solution is discharged into vigorously stir red isopropanol to form fibrils. Polymer solvent is distilled from the resulting slurry 42 . The fibrils are refined in the isopropanol slurry 50 . The polymer solvent and the sop ropanol are recycled to the process 84 , 88 .
