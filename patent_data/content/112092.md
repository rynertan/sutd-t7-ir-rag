# Turbine blade with integral shroud and method of assembling the blades in a circular array.

## Abstract
A circular array of rotatable blades for a steam turbine formed from blades having an integral shroud 15 with a leading planar surface 17 and a trailing planar surface 19 , the leading planar surface 17 being parallel to an axial radial plane 21 passing through the center of the root of the blade and the trailing planar surface 19 , if extended, intersecting the axial radial plane 21 passing through the center of the root of the blade to form an angle equal in degrees to 360 divided by the number of blades forming the circular array.
