# Am stereo signal decoder.

## Abstract
A simplified stereo signal decoder is disclosed for use in an AM stereo receiver which receives composite AM stereo broadcast signals comprising a radio frequency carrier wave having amplitude modulation representing stereo sum L R information and phase modulation representing stereo dif ference L R information. The decoder makes novel use of a common, commercially available integrated circuit IC that normally is used as a tone detector or a frequency modulation FM detector. The decoder provides synchro nous detection of the L R information, combined two mode phase locked loop PLL recovery of the carrier component and enabling of the L R signal output, and delayed enabling of the L R signal output for a stereo bloom effect. The decoder is particularly useful for decod ing independent sideband ISB AM stereo broadcast signals.
