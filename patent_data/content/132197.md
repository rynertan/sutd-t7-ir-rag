# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR CLEANING AN OIL CONTAMINATED VESSEL

## Abstract
An apparatus and process adapted to clean oil contami nated vessels 1 which uses a closed fluidized system 10 through which fluidized sludge is recirculated to be sprayed under pressure on interior walls of the vessel. Emulsifying agents are added to the vessel to initially form a pool of fluidized sludge in the vessel which is then conveyed to a tank and from the tank conveyed to a high pressure spray where it is sprayed onto the walls to fluidize more sludge.
