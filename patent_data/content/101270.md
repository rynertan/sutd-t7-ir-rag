# Tobacco opening and conditioning apparatus.

## Abstract
To enable tobacco, in the form of blocks e.g.. cases, bales or hogsheads of laminated tobacco to be handled e.g., cut, it is necessary to add moisture in a preconditioning apparatus. The apparatus comprises a tobacco conditioning cylin der 14 which is rotatable about a substantially horizontal axis or on an axis slightly inclined to the horizontal. The cylinder contains slicing means 16 which rotate with the cylinder and effect slicing of the tobacco between the laminae as the tobacco is conveyed into the cylinder.
