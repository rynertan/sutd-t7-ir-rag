# Container actuated counterpressure filling valve.

## Abstract
An improved liquid filling valve for filling containers with carbonated liquid such as soft drinks is disclosed which features concentric valves for introduction of the counter pressure gas and product into the container. The container is moved into sealing engagement with the valve which movement is continued to open the valve for admission of counterpressure gas. After counterpressurization is com pleted the valve for admission of product opens automatical ly allowing product to fill the container. After filling is completed, motion of the container away from the valve automatically closes it. In the bottle filling embodiment, motion of the bottle away from the valve additionally uncovers a snift port. The counterpressure filling and snifting of containers with carbonated liquids is thus accomplished without use of external valve operating cams or the like.
