# Method of inhibiting precipitation of salts from water dispersed in oil and compositions containing polymeric antiprecipitants.

## Abstract
Precipitation of salts such as barium and calcium sulfates is prevented in subsurface oil field formations or in streams of flowing oil which entrains water by adding emulsified, oil solu ble polymeric compositions.
