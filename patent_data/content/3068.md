# Faulty window construction detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A tri level output sensor 23, 25 for sensing faulty window 17 construction in a web of continuous business forms of stationery 13 , for controlling visual and audible indicators, including a display 31 of the relative position of the faulty sensed window construction, within a continually fanfolding end stack 21 . Pulsing circuitry drives tri level to digital processing circuitry, conjointly providing referencing information to process the sensor output and timing information to sample the processing circuitry, and drives a pair of counters 119, 103 for fanfold position indication and consecutive fault occurrence determination, dependent on the processing output.
