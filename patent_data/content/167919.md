## Description
Use of benzodiazepine derivatives for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical compositions for use in antagonizing cholecystokinin and gastrin and new benzodiazepine derivatives. The present invention concerns the use of benzodiazepine derivatives which have a substituent in the 3 position of the seven membered ring and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salts of said benzodiazepine derivatives for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical compositions for use in antagonizing cholecystokinin in gastrointestinal tissue and for antagonizing gastrin by binding to the corresponding cholecystokinin receptor or gastrin receptor. The present invention furthermore concerns new benzodiazepine derivatives. The benzodiazepine derivatives which are used according to the present invention comprise new chemical substances as well as also the benzodiazepine derivatives which are already disclosed in the prior art and which were already used as active ingredient of pharmaceutical compositions, however for other purposes than antagonizing cholecystokinin in gastrointestinal tissue and for antagonizing gastrin. Cholecystokinin CCK is a neuropeptide composed of thirtythree aminoacids in its originally isolated form. See Mutt and Jorpes, Gastrin occurs in 34, 17 and 14 amino acid forms in cirulation and is related to CCK by indentity of the C terminal pentapeptides Gly Trp Met Asp Phe NHR₂. Gastrin and CCK exist in both gastrointestinal tissue and the central nervous system see V. Mutt, CCK is believed to play an important role in appetite regulation and CCK may be a physiological satiety hormone see G.P. Smith, Among additional effects of CCK are stimulation of colonic motility, stimulation of gall bladder contraction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and inhibition of gastric emptying. CCK reportedly co exists with dopamine in certain mid brain neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain, as well as serving as a neurotransmitter in its own right. See A.J. Prange et al., Peptides in the Central Nervous System , The primary role of gastrin appears to be stimulation of secretion of water and electrolytes from the stomach and it is therefore involved in control of gastric acid secretion. CCK antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of animals, specially humans. CCK antagonists are also useful in potentiating and prolonging opiate mediated analgesia and thus have utility in the treatment of pain see P.L. Faris Three distinct chemical classes of CCK receptor antagonists have been reported. One class comprises derivatives of cyclic nucleotides detailed structure function studies have demonstrated that of the various members of this class, dibutyryl cyclic GMP is the most potent. See N. Barlos et al., The second class comprises peptide antagonists which are C terminal fragments and analogs of CCK. Recent structure function studies have shown that both shorter C terminal fragments of CCK Boc Met Asp Phe NH₂, Met Asp Phe NH₂ as well as longer CCK fragments Cbz Tyr SO₃H Met Gly Trp Met Asp NH₂ can function as CCK antagonists. See R.T. Jensen et al., All of these compounds are relatively weak antagonists of CCK IC₅₀ 10 ⁴ 10 ⁶M generally, 10 ⁴M but down to 10 ⁶M in the case of peptides . The peptide antagonists have substantial stability and absorption problems. Gastrin antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of gastrin related disorders of the gastrointestinal system in humans and animals such as ulcers, Zollinger Ellison syndrome, central G cell hyperplasia and other conditions in which reduced gastrin activity is of therapeutic value. There are no effective receptor antagonists of the In the publication of J. Bradwejn and in the corresponding benzodiazepine which is named lorazepam the radical R is hydrogen and in the corresponding compound named flurazepam the radical R is a group of formula In both said compounds the benzene nucleus which is bonded to the carbon atom in the position 5 is substituted in its ortho position with a chlorine atom. The third tested compound which is named diazepam differs from the compounds of formula A in that to the carbon atom in the position 3 of the seven membered ring there are bonded two hydrogen atoms and no hydroxy group and in said compound the radical R is methyl and the benzene nucleus bonded to the carbon atom in the position 5 is unsubstituted. Of the three tested compounds lorazepam had the highest antagonizing activity and there is nowhere stated in said publication that the three tested benzodiazepines are also able to antagonize cholecystokinin in the gut. The benzodiazepine BZD structure class has been widely exploited as therapeutic agents, specially as central nervous system CNS drugs. These compounds exhibit strong binding to benzodiazepine receptors However in the following publications there are described benzodiazepine derivatives which have a substituent in the 3 position.

In the British patent 1 034 872 there are as well disclosed benzodiazepine derivatives which about correspond to the above stated formula B, which however are not N oxides, but the nitrogen atom in the position 4 of the 7 membered ring is the nitrogen atom of a corresponding tertiary amino group. In the compounds disclosed in said British patent the radical Furthermore in the compounds described in said British patent the benzene nucleus which is condensed with the 7 membered aromatic ring can be optionally substituted with a haline atom and to the carbon atom in the position 5 of the 7 membered ring there can be bonded either an optionally substituted phenyl radical or a heteroaromatic radical like thienyl. The compounds disclosed in said British patent are stated to have a muscle relaxant effect, a sedative effect or an anticonvulsant effect. In the British patent 1 309 947 there are described benzodiazepine derivatives which about correspond to the above stated formula B, which compounds however are not N oxides, but the nitrogen atom in the position 4 of the 7 membered ring is a corresponding tertiary amino group. In said compounds furthermore the radical Furthermore in said compounds the benzene nucleus which is condensed with the 7 membered ring can be optionally substituted with 1 or 2 substituents and to the carbon atom in the position 5 of the heterocyclic ring there can be bonded instead of an optionally substituted phenyl nucleus also an alkyl group, a phenyl substituted alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or a heterocyclic group.

The benzodiazepine derivatives described in said British patent are stated to have the activity of tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, antispasmodics, anticonvulsants and hypnotics see page 2, right column, lines 77 83 . In the French patent publication 2 220 269 there are described benzodiazepine derivatives which are closely related to the compounds of formula B stated before, which compounds however are not N oxides, but the nitrogen atom in the position 4 of the 7 membered ring is the nitrogen atom of a tertiary amino group.

In the U.S. patent 4 045 569 there are described benzodiazepine derivatives which have a tranquilizing activity and said compounds correspond to formula B stated before, except that they are not N oxides, i.e. the nitrogen atom in the position 4 of the 7 membered ring is the nitrogen atom of a tertiary amino group. In said compounds furthermore the radical To sum up there are accordingly described in the prior art several benzodiazepine derivatives in which the carbon atom in the position 2 of the 7 membered ring is a carbonyl group. Some of said compounds have a substituent in the position 3 of the 7 membered ring and the corresponding compounds usually have a muscle relaxant activity, a sedative activity, a tranquilizing activity and some of them are hypnotics. Nowhere in the prior art, except the citation Nature, 312, pages 363 and 364, there is reported that the benzodiazepine 2 ones described in the prior art had the ability of antagonizing cholecystokinin or of antagonizing gastrin. Furthermore in the citation Nature there are only described three specific benzodiazepine 2 ones, which are closely related to each other and which compounds are able to antagonize the sulphated form of the cholecystokinin octapeptide in the brain. It was the aim of the present invention to prepare pharmaceutical preparations which are able to antagonize cholecystokinin not only in the brain but also in the gut and which furthermore are also able to antagonize gastrin, by using as active ingredient of said pharmaceutical composition benzodiazepine derivatives. It was now surprisingly found out that several benzodiazepine derivatives described in the prior art as well as new benzodiazepine derivatives have the desired activity. One object of the present invention is the use of compounds of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salt of said compound of formula I in which compounds of formula I wherein q is 0, then R⁷ has to have another meaning than that of a group of formula for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical compositions for use in antagonizing cholecystokinin in gastrointestinal tissue and for antagonizing gastrin by binding to the corresponding cholecystokinin receptor or gastrin receptor. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention there are used compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of formula I for the manufacturing of the corresponding pharmaceutical compositions the pharmaceutically active ingredient in which compounds of formula I Still more preferred it is to use as pharmaceutically active ingredient a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salt of said compound of formula I in which The most preferred class of pharmaceutically active ingredients of the above stated preferred group corresponding to formula I are those compounds of formula I in which As already outlined before the active ingredients of formula I for use in the invention comprise compounds which are already described in the prior art, however not as antagonists of cholecystokinin and as antagonists of gastrin, as well as compounds which are new. It furthermore was surprisingly found out that the compounds used in the inventive process have the ability of binding strongly to CCK receptors, however only weakyl to benzodiazepine receptors, specially with increasing size of the substituents of the compounds of formula I. As it can be seen from the above stated definition of the preferred compounds of formula I the stereo chemistry of said compounds in the position 3 is R, which accordingly corresponds to a D amino acid like D tryptophan. Contrary to this the preferred stereo chemistry of the prior art benzodiazepines in the position 3 is S, which accordingly would correspond to a L amino acid, such as L tryptophan. In the compounds of formula I corresponding substituents which occur more than once in any structure are intended to be independent of the corresponding definition elsewhere in the structure. This for instance is true for the different substituents as well as the symbols m, n and p. With the ring fragment since each p is independently 1 or 0, represents the three structures and when R¹³ is not O. The halo substituents of the compounds of formula I are fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. A further object of the present invention are new benzodiazepine derivatives which correspond to the following formula Ia wherein The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I used for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions are e.g. corresponding salts of the compounds of formula I with non toxic inorganic acids or non toxic organic acids. For example, such conventional non toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic and isethionic. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be synthesized from the compounds of Formula I which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts are prepared by reacting the free base or acid with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt forming inorganic or organic acid or base in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acid of Formula I are also readily prepared by conventional procedures such as treating an acid of Formula I with an appropriate amount of a base, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide e.g. sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, or magnesium, or an organic base such as an amine, e.g., dibenzylethylenediamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, pyrrolidine and benzylamine, or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The pharmaceutical preparations of compounds of Formula I. can be used for the treatment and the prevention of disorders of the gastrointestinal, and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, especially of man. Specifically, they are useful in treatment and prevention of disorders of gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, pancreatic secretions, and dopaminergic functions. The compositions which contain compounds of Formula I are especially useful in the prevention and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, excess pancreatic or gastric secretion, acute pancreatitis and motility disorders. The pharmaceutical compositions contain the compounds of formula I or salts thereof either alone, or preferably, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compositions can be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and topical administration. For oral use of an antagonist of CCK or gastrin the compositions can be administered, for example, in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are commonly added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. When a composition containing a compound of Formula I or a salt thereof is used as an antagonist of CCK or gastrin in a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However, in most instances, an effective daily dosage will be in the range from about 0.05 mg to about 50 mg kg and preferably 0.5 mg to about 20 mg kg in a single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. The compounds of Formula I are prepared according to the following schemes.
