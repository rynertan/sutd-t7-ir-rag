## Description
This . nvention relates to a method fcr producing high molecular wight stereoregular polymers More particularly, this invention relates te a modified catalyst system for producing high molecular weight stereoregular isotactic polymers using Zie ler Natta catalysts and a small amount of Group I A andor II A organop5Gsphides. Two component systems for polymerizing a olefins for the production of polymers comprising of organo aluminum compounds and transition metal salts and halides are known as described in U.S. Patent 3,113,115 issued to Ziegler et al. Such catalysts have become well knowsn generally asZiegler Natta catalyst systems. A variety of compounds have been identified as effective modifiers te the conventional system described in the referenced patent. Many patents are directed toward processes for improving the stereospecificity of the polymerization of alpha olefins, particularly butene, when using the catalysts of the Ziegler Natta type. For example, British Patent 1,421,217 describes the use of hydrazine derivatives such as l,l dimethylhydrazine to increase stereospecificity. U.S.Patent 3,318,860 teaches a third component comprising of a nitrogen containing Lewis base and then treating the modified Ziegler Natta catalyst so obtained with hydrogen. This modification of the catalyst system is taught to produce isotactic polymers having both reduced molecular weight and a high degree of stereoregularity.However, for many applications of polymers obtained using these systems, a high molecular weight is greatly desired.For example, when used for reducing the flow of liquids through pipelines, such polymers are commonly called drag reducing agents, and of necessity are 6f high molecular weight in order to be effective as drag reducers. Thus it is knowal that alpha olefins such as propylene and l butene can be converted to highly linear crystalline polymers at low temperatures using a Ziegler Natta catalyst.Crystalline polymers can be produced using such systems. The crystallinity of the polymer obtained is due to the arrangement cf the substituents along a polymer backbone. In general, isotactic polymers have a strictly regular arrangement of substituents yndiotactic polymers have a regularly alterrating patter CtL substituents atactic polymers have a completely at random pattern of substituents. The nlgn molecular weight isotactic polymers are commercially useful.However, the basic Ziegler Natta catalyst, compr ising of an organo metallic complex generated through the reaction of a transition metal compound such as titanium trichloride with an organo aluminum compound such as aluminum triethyl, is not free from disadvantages. In addition, the catalysts residues must be removed from the polymers since these substances have a detrimental influence on polymer properties such as color and light stability. Thus, modifications such as described above have been made to the basic catalyst. Another disadvantage of the basic Ziegler Natta catalyst is the low degree of tacticity. The degree of tacticity is a measure of the isotactic index, which is defined as the weight of the polymer insoluble in boiling diethylether. Highly stereoregular or isotactic polymers are to be greatly desired toward the preparation of film, pipe, packaging, lenses, and other useful articles of commerce Other references, such as U.S. Patent 3,476,730, hereby incorporated by reference, teach a process of polymerization of olefins in the presence of mixed catalysts of the Ziegler Natta type which contain third cOmponents.An extensive list of third components is proposed in this reference. In addition, United States Patent 3,635,839 teaches a modified catalyst system for stereospecific polymerization of olefins. This reference substitutes the reaction product of a dialkylaluminum chloride reaction with iodine in place of the organoaluminum compound proposed by the basic Ziegler Natta system. The result of such a reaction would be expected to be a dialkylaluminum chlorideiodide mixture. U.S. Patent 3,051,690, hereby incorporated by reference, utilizes hydrogen as a means of regulating molecular weight. However, none of these references, whether taken alone or in combination, provide an acceptable method for obtaining high molecular weight, highly regular, isotactic polymers. Such high molecular weight polymers would be extremely useful in applications such as reducing the flow resistance of fluids through pipelines.Highly isotactic polymers are very useful in the manufacture of pipe and films, lowering the molecular weight by carrying out merization reactions in the presence of hydrogen 2 it would therefore be of great benefit to provide a method for producing polymers from alpha olefins having a high molecular weight and or a highly isotactic structure It is therefore an object of the instant invention to provide a process for producing a highly isotactic polyolefins, particularly poly l butene, while optionally obtaining a high molecular weight polymer. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been discovered that a highly isotactic, high molecular weight polymers can be obtained from alphaolefins when polymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a compound of a transitional metal of groups IV B, V B, VI B, and VII B of the PeriodicTable in which the metal is in a reduced valence state, and an organoaluminum halide, together with a limited amount ofGroup I A or II A metal organophosphide, said amount being from about .01 to about .15 moles of metal organophosphide based on the amount of the organoaluminum halide present.Amounts higher than .15 and lower than .01 are within the scope of this invention, but is must be realized that no gain in isotactivity and molecular weight will be obtained. Olefins which can be polymerized using the process of the instant invention are those having the formula CH2 CHR in which R represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical with up to.about 10 carbon atoms or a cyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical. Representative examples of such olefins are ethylene, butene and propylene. However, higher olefins, as well as these materials, can be used to form copolymers, one with another. The polymerization of these materials is usually carried out in a slurry in liquid butene or inert diluent such as heptane, octane, benzene, or other diluents known to the art. In the case of butene l and higher olefins however, it is preferred to use the solution polymerization techniques described in U.S. Patent 3,362,940, hereby incorporated by reference. The preparation of the catalyst of the instant invention can be by any one of several methods. The most preferred method is simply preparing the desired Zieg Natta basic catalyst, and addi ng lithium diphenylphosphide to the catalyst wale in the reactor. However, the catalyst can be totally prepared outside the reactor by techniques well known to those skilled ln the art, including cocrystallization and ball milling techniques. The addition of the metal organophosphide prior to insertion into the reactor does not affect the catalyst or the method of carrying out the polymerization. Thus, metal organophosphide may be added before, during or after the charging of the Ziegler Natta catalyst of olefin. The instant invention provides an improved process for polymerizing alpha olefins to isotactic polymers, the improvement comprising carrying out the polymerization in the presence of a catalyst comprising dialkylaluminum halides, titanium trichloride, and Groups I A or II A organophosphides, wherein the metal organophosphide is present in the catalyst in amounts of from about .01 to about .15 mole per mole of dialkylaluminum halide. Generally, the Group I A metal organo phosphide modifier has the formula M P R1 R2, wherein M is an alkali metal and R1 and R2 are, independently, aryl, alkyl, aralkyl or alkaryl. When Group II A metals are used, the modifier has the formula M PR1R2 2, where M is a Group II A metal and R1 and R2 are as described above. Representative examples of such catalyst modifiers are lithium diphenylphosphide, sodium dibutylphosphide, potassium di phenylmethyl phosphide, rubidium dibenzylphosphide, cesium butylphenylphosphide, lithium methylphenyl phenylmethyl phosphide, potassium phenylmethyl methyl phosphide, sodium phenyl methylphenyl phosphide, beryllium diphenylphosphide, magnesium di phenylmethyl phosphide, calcium dibutylphosphide, strontium dibenzylphosphide, and barium butylphenylphosphide. Of these, diphenylphosphides are preferred. Representative examples of such diphenylphosphides are those having Group I A and II A cations, such as lithium diphenylphosphide, sodium diphenylphosphide, potassium diphenylphosphide, rubidium diphenylphosphide, cesium diphenylphosphide, beryllium diphenylphosphide, magnesium diphenylphosphide, calcium diphenylphosphide, strontium diphenylphosphide, and barium diphenylphosphide Polymerizations are generally carried out at temperatures less than 2500C and pressures less than 150 atmospheres, but can be carried out within a temperature range cf from about 1100C to about 2500C and preferably between 10 C and about i50 C., and pressures of about ambient, or preferably at pressures of from about 1 to 50 atmospheres.It is realized that higher pressures can be used to increase the reaction rate however, such pressures are not normally necessary. Representative examples of dialkyl aluminum halides useful in the practice in the instant invention are diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl aluminum chloride, and ethylbutyl aluminum chloride. Representative examples of transition metal halides are violet titanium trichloride, vanadium trichloride and vanadium trichloride oxide. Should highly isotactic polymers of lower molecular weight be desired, the catalyst system of the instant invention could be utilized in conjunction with hydrogen during polymerization to lower molecular weight to desired levels. This procedure is set forth in U.S. Patent 3,056,690, and is entirely compatible with the instant invention to produce highly isotactic polymer of desired molecular weight The invention is more concretely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to illustrate the instant invention and do not limit it. Example 1 is a comparative example wherein a polymerization is carried out in the absence of a lithium diphenylphosphide stereoregulator and molecular weight amplifier. Example 2 shows an identical reaction carried out using lithium diphenylphosphide. Examples 3 and 4 vary the amount of lithium diphenylphosphide added.
