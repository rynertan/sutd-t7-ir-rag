# The interfacial viscosification of salt water systems utilising sulphonated polymers.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for the gelation i.e. thickening of salt water which includes the steps of formig a solvent system of an organic liquid or oil and a polar cosolvent, the polar cosolvent being less than 15 weight percent of the solvent system, the viscosity of the solvent system being less than 1000 cps dissolving a nonionic surfactant and water insoluble neutralised sulphon ated polymer in the solvent system to form a solution, the concentration of the neutralised sulphonated polymer in the solution being 0.01 to 0.5 weight percent, the concentration of the nonionic surfactant in the solvent system being 0.0001 to 1.0 weight percent, the viscosity of the solution being less than 2,000 cps. Thereafter said solution is admixed or contacted with 5 to 500 volume percent of salt water, the salt water being immiscible with the organic liquid, the polar cosolvent and nonionic surfactant wherein the water insolu ble, neutralised sulphonated polymer transfers from the organic liquid to the salt water phase, thereby causing the salt water phase to gel.
