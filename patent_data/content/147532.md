# Rotatable tool power lock retention apparatus for food processor.

## Abstract
Rotatable tool power lock retention apparatus for food processors having a working bowl 26 with a vertical motor driven shaft 23 extending up into the bowl 26 and in which a rotatable tool has a hub 15 removably engaging upon this shaft 23 in driving relation with the shaft 23 . The tool has at least one outwardly extending food processing blade 12, 14 secured to the hub 15 , such as cutting and chopping blade or a dough mixing and kneading blade. During a food processing operation, the rapid rotation of the tool blade 12, 14 with respect to the food being processed often creates a dynamic lifting action on the blade 12, 14 , thereby tending to raise or elevate the hub 15 upward along the drive shaft 23 . The present tool retention apparatus prevents the hub 15 from being lifted upwardly relative to the drive shaft 23 during operation and yet it enables quick, easy installation and removal of the tool.
