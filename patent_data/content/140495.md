## Description
This invention relates to a method of making a stable, optically clear, triglyceride containing serum especially useful as a standard or reference solution. Reliable results in any chemical analytical determination of various blood serum components depend upon the continuous evaluation of the test procedure, equipment and reagents being used. This is accomplished by calibration of the instruments with standard solutions and the use of controls concurrent with the analysis to be performed see, generally, U.S. Patent No. 4,158,544 . These controls or standards contain known amounts of the material being analyzed, such as triglyceride. The level of triglyceride in normal human blood is critical, as it is generally recognized that high concentrations are related to coronary artery disease. It is, therefore, necessary to provide controls and standards containing normal and elevated triglyceride levels, to avoid discrepancies between various analytical procedures. Thus, accurate results in the use of instruments, particularly in the case of highly automated instruments, depend upon the strict standardization of the biochemical determinations being made. Substantial work has gone toward providing triglyceride rich fractions from various sources in order to enhance the triglyceride levels of human and animal sera which are thereby made available for use as such calibrators or controls see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,764,556 . The use of human sera in the preparation of chemical standards and controls for the assay of human serum constituents is well known, and they are usually provided as lyophilized materials to be reconsituted at the time of use. However, these sera are often highly turbid, both before lyophilization and after reconstitution. Even sera which are clear prior to lyophilization are sometimes found to be highly turbid upon reconstitution. This turbidity in serum and plasma samples is believed to be due to the presence of proteins or of lipids, which are primarily composed of triglycerides. Turbidity in lyophilized biological products has been shown to correlate with triglyceride level see Buhl, et al, For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,853,465 discloses the reduction of serum turbidity by treating the serum with a polyoxyethylated lauric acid which remains in the serum even during use in an assay procedure. More recently, U.S. Patent No. 3,955,925 has described a procedure for reducing serum turbidity by precipitating chylomicrons, unstable very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins, from human serum. The process includes mixing a human serum sample with a metal cation and thereafter adding a polysulphate derivative which precipitates lipoprotein polysulphate complexes containing the constituents to be removed. A precipitating agent such as oxalate is then added to precipitate the remaining metal cation from the clear supernatant, which is then stored for use. This process requires the use of human serum for preparation of calibrators or controls. The triglyceride levels of the human serum, which are reduced by this precipitation, must be restored to desired levels by the addition of soluble derivatives, such as trichloroacetate triglyceride of glycerol triacetate, or by the addition of stable lyophilizable lipoproteins from animal sources, such as bovine lipoprotein fractions containing triglycerides, in order to provide a suitable calibrator or control preparation. U.S. Patent 4, 045, 176 further describes the preparation of standards and controls by the addition of human high density lipoproteins or non primate lipoproteins to human serum. As in U.S. Patent 3955925, it is indicated that the serum standards or references must be prepared from a base of human serum. The required use of human sera presents severe limitations of availability and cost in making calibrators and controls available. further, turbid sera result after lyophilization and rehydration when triglycerides have been added by conventional methods. U.S. Patent No. 4,264,471 describes a process for preparing delipified serum or plasma. The process involves first mixing the serum with an anion cation ion exchange resin to reduce the pH of the serum to 5.2 0.3 causing the precipitation of lipoproteins from the sera, followed by a separation step in which the supernatant serum is separated from the resin and the precipitated lipoproteins. Thus, this process also removes components from the serum which must be replaced to provide a suitable calibrator or control preparation. As above, turbid sera result after lyophilization and rehydration when triglycerides have been added by conventional methods. European specification no. 82587A discloses a serum composition and a method of making it which does not require the type of chemical treatment above described. The method provides for an extraction of acid precipitatable molecules to provide a stable, optically clear serum which is suitable for use in making calibrators and controls. This acid precipitation or insolubilization step creates a cloudy or turbid serum which is thereafter clarified by filtration or centrifugation. After this clarification, the serum is stabilized or neutralized by raising the pH to a range of from 7.0 to 8.0. This method does not remove serum components which must be replaced to provide a suitable calibrator or control preparation. Analytes of clinical interest can be introduced in conventional fashion thereafter, either before or after lyophilization of the stabilized, clear serum so prepared. Analytes which can be introduced in such conventional fashion include triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, various enzymes and ionic analytes of interest. As such, the method disclosed involves the preparation of an optically clear serum of human or animal origin in the absence of added analyte. In summary, the numerous serum clarification techniques which remove lipids, including triglycerides, from the serum lead those skilled in the art to the conclusion that such serum components cannot withstand the rigorous procedures necessary and must be restored artificially after the procedure has been completed, providing a base serum from which suitable calibrator or control can be prepared. Even European specification no. 82587A does not address the possibility of preparing sera having the desired levels of triglyceride prior to the complete clarification process. As such, there has been no disclosure of a method of achieving this desirable goal or of any product which such a method could offer. In contrast to the overall teaching and disclosure of the prior art and in accordance with the present invention, we have now found that it is possible to clarify sera of either human or animal sources having added triglycerides, without affecting the observed triglyceride levels. Further, the process of the invention offers sera of acceptable optical clarity in the presence of triglyceride levels which heretofore rendered serum calibrators and controls unreliable or totally unreadable. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a stable, optically clear, triglyceride containing serum from a serum containing one or more components susceptible to precipitation over time, which method comprises the steps in sequence of reducing the pH of the serum to not more than 5, removing insolubles, and then raising the pH to between 7 and 8 to stabilise the serum Triglycerides of any of a number of origins can be combined with the serum either before or after the pH reduction step. The acid insolubilized components are separated from the serum by separation techniques such as filtration or centrifugation and the separated serum is thereafter stabilized by establishing a pH of from 7 to 8 therein. This serum preparation can thereafter be used substantially immediately or can be lyophilized for later use. Further, in accordance with the invention, there is provided a stable, optically clear, triglyceride containing serum composition produced by the above described process. This composition retains the highly desirable level of optical clarity even in the presence of serum triglyceride concentrations not previously possible in sera having a clarity sufficient for clinical use. Other clinically significant analytes can be included in the serum in addition to the triglycerides. One of the significant advantages provided by the invention is that sera of any of a variety of human or animal sources can be used as starting material for preparing calibrators or controls applicable to clinical chemistry evaluations of human serum samples. As such, the sera which can be used in the method can be derived from human sources, such as pooled blood bank sources, or from animal sources, such as bovine, porcine or animal primate sources. These primate and non primate animal sources are made appropriate for use in clinical chemistry control and standard solutions by the method of the present invention. Other sources of sera which are tested by conventional means and give appropriate results as calibrators or controls are contemplated and can, likewise, be processed in accordance with the method of the invention to provide appropriate compositions. The triglyceride which is incorporated into the serum by the process of the present invention can be derived from any of a number of sources, including those which are known for use in the preparation of prior art controls and calibrators. For example, chicken egg yolk lipoproteins or water soluble triglycerides, such us trichloroacetate triglyceride, trihemisuccinate glycerol, glycerol triacetate and glycerol tripropionate can be added to the serum. Alternatively, isolated bovine lipoprotein fractions containing triglycerides can be added prior to or after the insolubilization step. The method in accordance with the invention preferably includes, an additional step of determining the endogenous protein concentration of the serum starting materials, by any conventional protein determination method, since the reproducible accuracy of the triglyceride levels for calibrators and controls is properly compared to a characteristic which defines the concentration of the serum itself. Normal total protein concentrations in serum range from about 6.6 to about 8.3 grams per 100 milliliters of serum in general. However, a variety of recognized methods for determination of protein in serum have been developed, each of which gives varying results on samples of similar protein content. Any standardized method which is used consistently is appropriate and such methods are discussed in Henry, et al, Eds , In accordance with the invention, triglyceride is usually added to the serum to an extent sufficient to provide a final triglyceride concentration of 14 milligrams of triglyceride per gram of endogenous protein. In preferred embodiments, sufficient triglyceride is added to provide a normal human triglyceride concentration of 33 milligrams per gram of endogenous protein, and especially preferred is the range of from 35 to 43 milligrams or more of triglyceride per gram of endogenous protein as a final concentration. Such are based on methods which provide at least a normal serum protein concentration range, of from 14 to 17 grams per deciliter of serum. The insolubilization step is effected by reducing the pH of the serum below about pH 5, preferably by the addition of an inorganic or organic acid which does not interfere with any of the properties of the serum which will affect its intended use. Suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Suitable organic acids include acetic, benzoic, oxalic, phthalic and maleic acids. The reduction of serum pH is preferably effected by the intermittent addition of small amounts of acid with a continuously monitoring pH meter in place. The serum can be combined with the triglyceride sources either prior to or after establishing a pH in the serum of below 5. In either case, an additional clinically significant substance can be added to the serum along with the triglyceride at this stage or at subsequent stages of the process without interference to their properties or concentrations. Such other substances can include, for example, albumin, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, glucose, inorganic phosphate, iron, potassium, sodium and urea. A more comprehensive list is set forth in the embodiments described by the working example. In combination with any of the above embodiments, the step of separating the acid insolubilized components from the serum can be performed by known techniques for separating precipitative materials, including filtration, centrifugation and other such mechanical separation techniques. Filtration can be accomplished by use of filtering media or paper, such as asbestos cellulose or a fiberglass filter media. The addition of diatomaceous earth as a filtering aid has also been found advantageous. The step of stabilizing the separated serum is accomplished by establishing a pH of from about 7.0 to about 8.0 therein by the addition of am inorganic or organic base which does not interfere with any of the properties of the serum which will affect its intended use. Suitable inorganic bases include sodium, potassium and ammonium hydroxide and metal oxides such as aluminum and copper oxide. Suitable organic bases include trihydroxy aminomethane, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide and trimethyl amine. The stabilized, optically clear, triglyceride containing serum so prepared can be used immediately, stored for later use or lyophilized for long term storage and reconstituted prior to use. Alternatively, the serum can be lyophilized prior to stabilization and stabilized after reconstitution and just prior to use. The following working Examples describe experiments which were performed in developing the present invention. Standard commercially available reagent grade chemicals were used whenever possible. Reference will be made to the accompanying drawing which is a graphical illustration of the triglyceride concentration and absorbence of commercial products and the preparations in accordance with the invention as prepared in the Example. One hundred liters of Plasma Diagnostic Base concentrated bovine serum Armour Pharmaceutical Co., Tarrytown, NY were assayed for total protein T. Protein concentration on a SMAC continuous flow analyzer Technicon Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, NY . A concentration of 19 grams per deciliter g dl was found. The 100 liters of serum was combined with 66.5 g egg yolk triglycerides to give 35 milligrams mg triglycerides per g of T. Protein. The egg yolk triglycerides were prepared by combining 1 volume of chicken egg yolks with 3 volumes of 50 millimolar mM TRIS succinate buffer pH 7.5 followed by centrifugation for 1 hour at 5000 g. TRIS is tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane. The supernatant was saved and assayed for triglycerides on a SMAC analyzer. A value of 4500 mg triglycerides per dl of the preparation was found. The serum triglycerides preparation so obtained was stirred until homogenous, about 20 minutes, and 3 molar M hydrochloric acid was added to make the solution pH 4.5 range 4.4 4.6 . The pH was continuously monitored by a pH meter with the electrode in dwelling in the preparation. The serum triglycerides preparation was again stirred for 30 minutes. Then, 500 g of Standard SuperCel brand diatomaceous earth Johns Mansville, Celite Division, Denver, CO was added and the preparation stirred for an additional 30 minutes before being filtered. An AMF Cuno AMF, Cuno Division, Meridian, CT filter housing containing AMF Cuno 50S filter media was used to remove the diatomaceous earth. The filtered serum was titrated to pH 7.5 range 7.4 7.6 with 4 M sodium hydroxide. The serum was then sterilized by filtering through an autoclaved filter consisting of AMF Cuno 90S media in a AMF Cuno housing. The yield was 97 liters of the triglyceride containing serum preparation, which had a T. Protein of 17.2 g dl and triglycerides of 602 mg dl. This serum was then used to make three separate preparations having levels of other analytes which were the same as those in the TQC Alert 1 Chemistry Control, Chemistry Calibrator and TQC Alert 2 products. Complete information on the additional analytes and their concentrations is available for each of the products to which these preparations were conformed from Technicon Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, NY. The desired levels of other analytes were established by dilution and or additions to the serum in a conventional manner. The serum triglycerides T. Protein ratio was approximately 35 mg g for each. The formulated serum was filtered through on a Pall NRP 0.2 µm micron filter Pall Trinity Micro Corp., Cortland, NY to remove any added microbes. After filtration, the serum was aliquoted into amber vials, frozen and dried under reduced pressure. The lyophilized products were rehydrated with appropriate amounts of diluent 20 ml for calibrator and 10 ml for controls for use as calibrators for clinical methods or as controls to monitor analysis of analytes of clinical interest. The above described preparations were then compared for triglyceride concentration and optical clarity turbidity with several of the presently available commercial products offered for use as calibrators and or controls. The triglyceride concentration of each commercial product and of the preparations in accordance with the invention were measured on a SMAC automated analyzer. Turbidity determinations of each were made by measurement of absorbence at 710 nanometers nm using a 1.0 centimeter cm light path on a Cary Model 219 spectrophotometer Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA . The commercial products and preparations in accordance with the invention which were so tested are grouped by their approximate triglyceride concentrations in Table 1. The results obtained using each of the preparations set forth in Table 1 is graphically illustrated in the accompanying drawing. As can be seen from reference to the drawing, the preparations in accordance with the invention were substantially less turbid than any of the prior art products at each of the triglyceride concentrations tested. This enhanced optical clarity improves the reliability of the preparation at each of the triglyceride concentrations tested and makes it possible to obtain accurate results from sera containing higher concentrations of triglyceride than could reliably be used in the past.
