## Description
The present invention relates to novel pesticidal aqueous based microemulsions and methods for using said microemulsions for controlling insect pests. Aqueous pesticidal formulations have attracted considerable interest in recent years because such formulations possess certain advantages over non aqueous systems. One such advantage such suspension concentrates, concentrated emulsions, and flowables possess includes the reduction or elimination in using organic solvents. This reduction or elimination of organic solvent use then results in reduced phytotoxicity encouraged by some organic solvents decreases in costs when compared to organic based systems safer handling compatibility with a greater variety of packaging materials and, in some instances, enhanced biological activity. Recently, concentrated aqueous emulsions have been introduced as alternative pesticidal formulations to emulsifiable concentrates. The successful introduction of such emulsion compositions is due to advances made both in understanding formulating such emulsions and understanding factors influencing emulsion stability. Even with such advances in understanding emulsion stability, it is known that the high surface area created in preparations of this sort is usually accompanied by large surface free energies. This, in turn, creates the opportunity for a variety of breakdown processes, and therefore, while the kinetic stability of these emulsions dispersions may be increased, they still represent thermodynamically unstable systems. Microemulsions, on the other hand, present a unique class of thermodynamically stable liquid dispersions. This stability is attributed to the presence of near zero interfacial tensions at equilibrium and also a minimum or potentially negative Gibbs free energy term for the system. In order to achieve low interfacial tensions, the use of several surfactants is usually required. When one of the surfactants is soluble in the water phase and the other is soluble in the organic phase, each one has only a marginal effect on the other, and their combined effect may be large enough to reduce the inter facial tension to near zero at finite concentrations. Thus, although microemulsions are obtainable with certain surfactant combinations and within finite concentrations of these surfactant combinations, at present, formulating such microemulsions is still an art. The present invention, therefore, relates to novel insecticidal microemulsion compositions which are aqueous based. These microemulsions are comprised of 1 to 20 , on a weight to volume basis, of an insecticide and 1.0 to 40 , preferably 1.25 to 40 , on a weight to volume basis, of a certain surfactant blend plus water. These microemulsions can also contain microemulsion adjuvants such as antifoaming agents, antifreezing agents, viscosity adjusting agents thickening agents , and antimicrobial preservatives, with the remainder being water. These aqueous based insecticidal microemulions are thermodynamically stable and exhibit exceptional stability over a wide range of temperatures. Furthermore, it is an additional object of the present invention to provide such temperature stable microemulsions in a clear to opaque form. Additionally, another object of this invention is to provide methods whereby such microemulsions are useful in combatting insect pests, especially methods wherein the microemulsions of the invention are applied utilizing ultra low volume ULV applications. These and other objects will become apparent by the more detailed description of the invention that follows. The present invention is a novel, aqueous based insecticidal microemulsion composition comprising 1 to 20 , on a weight to volume basis, of an insecticide, such as the synthetic pyrethroid, α cyano Preferred surfactant blends of the present novel insecticidal microemulsion compositions include mixtures of a 70 alcoholic solution of calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate with ethoxylated distyrylphenol ammonium sulfate 5 moles ethoxylation and or ethoxylated tristyrylphenol 17 moles ethoxylation . The preferred ratios of such surfactants in combination are 3 7 5 1 14 0 and 6 0 9, respectively. The insecticidal microemulsion compositions of the invention may conveniently be prepared by admixing from 1 to 20 of an insecticide, on a weight to volume basis, such as the synthetic pyrethroid α cyano Alternatively, such compositions may be prepared by admixing the required amount of water to a mixture of surfactants combined with the synthetic pyrethroid or organophosphate. Then, the remaining ingredients may be added to the mixture. It also has been found that the stability of such prepared aqueous based insecticidal microemulsions may be enhanced by partial neutralization of acidic functions contained within the surfactants. Furthermore, the aqueous based microemulsion insecticidal compositions of the present invention contain finely divided discreet droplets with a droplet mass median size of about 17µ to 150µ. This, in combination with the unique surface tensions, viscosity and evaporation rates of such microemulsions, makes such microemulsions extremely attractive and effective when used in ultra low volume ULV applications. Additionally, the resultant insecticidal microemulsion compositions of the present invention possess an additional advantage in that they have unexpectedly low volatilities in ranges of 20 25 of that of water, when tested in a Piche evaporimeter. This allows for the selection of certain compositions, especially those containing 0.1 to 1 thickeners, useful for direct application by ultra low volume ULV techniques. Thus, the compositions of this invention allow for the direct application, utilizing ULV techniques, of water based formulations of insecticides, such as synthetic pyrethroids and organophosphates in addition to the suitability of such microemulsions for use under a wide variety of climatic conditions. It has been found that applying 0.0025 to 1.5 of the active ingredient of the present, aqueous based microemulsion to the habitat, food supply or breeding sites of insect pests, will produce effective control of such pests. The compositions and methods of the present invention are further illustrated by the following non limiting examples. A synthetic pyrethroid, at 1.33 to 20.0 , on a weight to volume basis, is added to a stirred mixture containing 0 to 1 , on a weight to volume basis, of a silicone antifoaming agent, the desired mixture of surfactants, as described in Table I, and 60 to 75 of the required water for higher pyrethroid concentrations or 5 to 20 water for lower pyrethroid concentrations. After stirring to ensure the microemulsion formation, usually one quarter to one hour, an antifreezing agent, such as ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol, at levels of 0 to 10 , on a weight to volume basis, is added, and the microemulsion is diluted to 100 with water. Thickening agents such as cellulose derivatives and required preservatives , polyacrylamides, natural gums, polyvinyl alcohols, or pyrollidones, among others, may then be admixed, as required, to yield the insecticidal microemulsion compositions of Examples 1 12 presented in Table II. Insecticidal aqueous microemulsion compositions containing 10 , on a weight to volume basis, of the synthetic pyrethroid, α cyano As is evident in reviewing TABLE III, the microemulsions of the present invention provide effective insecticidal activity for a variety of crops and under a variety of environmental conditions. A solution of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 0.5 , 1.5 kg in water 300 liters , containing ethanediol and methylparaben 0.3 kg was added to a 10 microemulsion prepared with the insecticide, α cyano m phenylbenzyl 2 Examples prepared as above possess evaporation rates, surface tensions and viscosities making them highly suitable for ULV application.
