# A method and an apparatus for determining the degree of freshness of fish or other pieces of meat.

## Abstract
By a method of and an apparatus for determining the degree of freshness of fish 19 or other pieces of meat a pair of electrodes of an electrode assembly 100 are brought into contact with the pieces of food, and the degree of freshness is determined electrically by determining the phase angle of the impedance which the tissue of the piece of food in question represents by inducing an alternating current into the tissue of the piece of food and by determining the delay of the voltage produced by the current in relation to the current. The pieces 19 of food are successively moved along a first path of movement 18 across a supporting surface, in which a first electrode assembly 100 is mounted for measuring the degree of freshness of the pieces of food at the first side, whereafter the pieces of food are successive ly turned upside down and moved along a weighing unit 23 and further along a second path of movement 20 across a supporting surface, in which a second electrode assembly 100 is mounted for measuring the degree of freshness of the other side of the piece of food. On the basis of the measurement of the degree of freshness and the weight of the piece of food in question, the pieces of food are sorted by means of sorting means 24 which bring the pieces of food to respective containers 26 . The sorting apparatus for carrying out the method comprises a first and a second supporting surface 18, 20 along which two measuring assemblies 100 are mounted, a weighting unit 23 , means 22 for turning the pieces of food upside down and sorting means 24 for sorting the pieces of food into respective containers 26 on the basis of the results determined by means of the electrode assemblies 100 and by means of the weighing unit 23 .
