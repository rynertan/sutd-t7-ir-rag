# Variable reluctance motor.

## Abstract
A high performance, low cost variable reluctance step per motor has an integral structure 10 with a ring 11 and a plurality of aligned salient pole members 12 . A plurality of teeth 14 are located on the face of each pole member 12 . Windings 13 are disposed on alternate ones of the pole members and a high impedance means 19 isolates the pole members from one another. A rotor with a plurality of teeth 16 and a plurality of holes 18 disposed thereon coacts with the pole members 12 and is moved in a step fashion by the sequential energization of the windings 13 . The flux generated by the energization of the windings 13 is confined to a short path and coupling to the remainder of the structure is negligible. Recesses 20 positioned symmetric ally around the structure enhance flux splitting and reduce adjacent flux coupling.
