# METHOD OF PRODUCING A CAMSHAFT

## Abstract
A method of producing a cast iron camshaft 1 compris ing the steps of applying a high density energy source, such as a TIG arc 3 , a laser beam, and an electron beam over the en tire sliding surface of a cam 2 to melt the surface portion and cooling the cam by dissipating the localized heat through the camshaft itself so as to form a double structure hardened layer 7 consisting of a chilled layer 8 having a large amount of ce mentite and a hardened layer 9 of martensite. This method omits the preheating of the camshaft prior to the high density energy irradiation.
