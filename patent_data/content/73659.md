# Brake mechanisms.

## Abstract
A brake mechanism 10 operable to maintain an air operable control drive mechanism 12 in position in the event of failure of the air supply comprises a first rack section 22 attached to a control lever 16 of the con trol drive mechanism 12 and engageable in any oper able position of the control lever 16 by a second arcu ate rack section 24 . A compression spring 62 acting on a toggle mechanism 28 biases the racks into engage ment, and an air cylinder assembly 26 acting on the toggle mechanism 28 against the compression spring 62 maintains the second rack section 24 out of en gagement with the first rack section 22 so long as the air supply to the air cylinder assembly 26 is main tained.
