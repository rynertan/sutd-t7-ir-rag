# Direct conversion radio receiver for F.M. signals.

## Abstract
A radio receiver for FM signals having a demodulation system 9 to produce an approximation to an analogue output by either measuring the time intervals between successive zero crossings in the intermediate frequency I.F. or by filtering pulses produced at zero crossings of the I.F.
