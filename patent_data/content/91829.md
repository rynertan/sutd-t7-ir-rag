# Ear defenders.

## Abstract
An ear defender for a headset, the ear defender compris ing a rigid shell 1 having holes 9 in a central portion to permit the passage of ambient sound and including a valve 11 mechanism to close the holes as required. The shell consists essentially of a unitary construction, being formed as a one piece moulding. The valve mechanism consists of a fixed plate 13 and sliding plate 19 both of which have holes which can be aligned to open the valve or misaligned to close the valve. The valve is mounted wholly within the shell so providing protection for the valve mechanism. Access to the valve and to other components within the shell is thus provided entirely from one side of the shell.
