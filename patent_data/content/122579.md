# A method in the operation of a firing plant, and a firing plant for performing the method.

## Abstract
A plant for performing the method is characterized by containing a pump 11 which has a relatively small inlet opening 10 so that the pump 11 creates a negative pressure in the portion 12 of the heat exchanger 9 where the liquid, fed by means of a nozzle 13 , evaporates. This allows large amounts of water to evaporate, and the flue gas, which flows through the heat exchanger portion 14 , is cooled to a low temperature. The flue gas will then condense, and this proce dure is accelerated by the constriction at 16 of the flue 15 so that there is a positive pressure in the heat exchanger portion 14 . According to the heat pump principle, the advantages are an unprecented low temperature level and humidity content of the discharged flue gas and a correspondingly high effi ciency of the firing plant.
