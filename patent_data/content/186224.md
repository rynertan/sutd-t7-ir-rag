# A method of converting particles liberated in chemical or physical processes into a harmless form by mixing with a molten slag.

## Abstract
A method of converting particles liberated in chemical or physical processes, such as fly ash, metal processing sludge particles obtained in the preparation of metals or metal compound, or particles of electroplating sludges, are made harmless by preheating these particles to at least 600 C and then mixing same with a molten slag material, whereafter the mixture is solidified and broken. Preferably, the particles are preheated to their softening point or are molten. Noxious products, such as metals, being present in said particles cannot be leached out from the broken solidified composition.
