# Peritoneal catheter.

## Abstract
A two section implantable catheter 10 for peritoneal dialysis is disclosed, the catheter 10 having a retainer section 11 which permanently ingrows into the abdominal wall and a catheter tube section 12 . The two sections 11, 12 are normally connected together in a fluid tight seal but may be separated to permit replacement of the tube section 12 of an indwelling catheter 10 without necessitating surgical removal of the retainer section 11 .
