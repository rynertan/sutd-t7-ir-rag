# Power tool.

## Abstract
A power tool comprising a motor 2 a rotatable output shaft 16 drivable by the motor and adapted to carry a tool 20 means 30 for generating a first electrical signal representing the torque applied to the output shaft means 40, 41 for generating a second electrical signal representing the angular rotation of the output shaft and means 100 for processing the signals whilst the tool is in operation to monitor the angle theta 1 theta 2 through which the drive shaft rotates whilst the applied torque rises from a predetermined threshold value T1 to its greatest value T2 and for generating an indicator signal if the said angle theta 1 theta 2 and the greatest value T2 both lie between respective predetermined maximum and minimum values theta 3, theta 4, T3, T4 , and for storing, in order, a predetermined number of values of the signals read at periodic intervals, and means 110 for displaying the stored values.
