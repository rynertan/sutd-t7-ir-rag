## Description
SPIRAL LOCK SAFETY CLOSURE TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to safety closure and container assemblies, and is particularly concerned with an improvement in safety closure and container assemblies wherein it is necessary to provide a li.quid or moisture proof seal for the contents of the container. BACKGROUND ART In order to reduce the number of accidental poisonings resulting from young children having access to unsafe medicines, drugs, household chemicals and other products, there has been considerable activity in recent years toward the development of closures and containers in which a type of manipulation between the cap and container is required in order to gain access to the contents of the container that a young child is incapable of performing. For example, it has been found that young children are generally incapable ot r.anip ulating a cap mounted on a container with bayonettype locking means a type of locking means that requires that the cap be pushed axially relative to the container and then rotated relative to the container in order to separate the cap from the container.The cap must be pushed axially toward the container against the biasing force of a spring in order to disengage the bayonet locking means. See, for example, Hedgewick U.S Reissue Patent No. 27,155. Gather examples of safety closure and on iainer asscrblies having various locking and scaling arrangements are disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 2,776,066 3,445,022 3,608,763 3,623,623 3,669,294 3,675,804 3,739,933 3,741,421 3,8g8,376 3,79t,200 3,952,899 3,963,139 3,979,001 4,032,028 and 4,049,148. When the contents of the container is liquid, or is some substance that deteriorates in an atmosphere of high humidity, the closure must be capable of maintaining an adequate seal under a variety of conditions. The contents of the container, if liquid, may require vigorous shaking before being used, or the contents may be of the type that causes a pressure buildup ithin the container over a period of time. A tight seal is also necessary in order to prevent the undesired escape of the contents frora the container, and because the entrance of moisture and other contaminents into the container may cause deterioration of the contents. In order to maintain a good seal against the entrance or escape of moisture, it is desirable to be able to provide a seal that projects into the mouth of the container and engages the inner surface of the container mouth with a tight fit Ptile the spring force on the cap should be sufficient to prevent children fron gaining access to the contents, it should not be so great as to rake it unduly difficult for adults to manipulate the cap. Accordingly, a tight seal r lust be mtaintained by the closure without at the same time r iaking it oo difficult for adults to manipulate the closure. In order to provide a tight, moisture proof seal, it is generally necessary for the cap to carry a sealing member with a flange tat pro jects into the mouth of the container into tight, scaling engagement with the inner surface thereof.United States Paters Nos. 3,432,065 3,623,623 3,753,510 3,974,928 and 4,049,148 each disclose safety closure and container assemblies having sealing members that are pushed into the mouth of the container by dome shaped spring portions on the sealing members. Considerable force is required in order to insert and remove such sealing members from the mouth of the container. With conventional bayonet locking elements on the cap and container of th type showm in the patents referred to in the preceding paragraph, the seal is inserted into and removed from the container primarily by the application of direct axial force between the cap and container.The orator, in applying the cap to the container, must first exert considerable axial pressure between the cap and container in order to force the seal into the mouth of the container before te cap is rotated nto locked engagement with the container. Conversely, in order to remove the cap from the container, after te cap has been unlocked from the container, the operator must pull the cap and sl axially from the container with a force sufficient to overcome the resistance of the seal to disengagement from the container. For the aged1 arthritic or otherwise infirm user, the Force required can cause considerable inconvenience. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to provide a safety closure and container assembly wherein a moisture proof seal is provided by a sealing order that projects into the container mouLh with cap and container locking means provicled which will permit the cap to be applied to the container with a smooth, rotatable motion relative to the container to force the sealing member into tight engagement with the mouth of the container and wherein the locking cans engage after the sealing member is pushed into the container such that the cap can b disengaged from the container only by first pushing the cap axially against a spring force on the sealing member and then rotating the cap relative to the container. A further object is to provide a tight, moisture proof safety closure and container assembly having improved locking means that will permit the cap to be applied to the container with a smooth, rotatable motion requiring little strength on the part of the user in carrying out the foregoing, and other objects, a child resistant closure assembly according to the present invention includes a cap having an end.wall with a skirt projecting therefrom with locking means formed on and projecting from the inner wall of the skirt for selective engagement with and disengagement from complementary locking means formed on the container. The cap locking means includes at least two sets of cap locking elements, each set being disposed in at least one helical path on the inner surface of the skirt. Each of the cap locking elements includes an elongated thread like rib having a trailing end located at the trailing end of the helical path and a leading end located near the free end of the skirt. The cap locking elements further includes a pair of spaced locking lugs, the first one of which is located near the free end of the skirt and the second one of which is located between the first lug and the leading end of the thread like rib. The container locking means includes at least to sets of container locking elements. Teach set of container locking elements includes an elongated guide rib located along a first container helical path on the outer surface of the outh portion of the container. Each set of container locking elements further includes a pair of spaced stop members located in a second container helical path.When the cap is applied to the container, the cap locking elements are camned downwardly by the elongated guide rib until the leading locking lug engages a connector portion to cam the locking lugs into locked engagement with tne stop members. The elongated thread like member of the cap locking elements engages the underside of the guide rib on the container to prevent axial separation of the cap and container, the engagent of the locking lugs and stop me ers preventing ray motion of the cap relative to the container. To remove the cap, the cap is pushed axially toward the container to disengage the locking lugs from the stop members to permit reverse rotation of the cap relative to the container. Other objects, advantages and features of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

BEST lODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION With reference to the drawings, a safety closure and container asscz Dly according to the embodiment of FIGURES 1 6 includes a container designated generally by reference numeral 10 and having a neck or mouLh potion 12 with an annular rim 14. The safety closure assembly of FIGURES 1 6 includes a cp 16 having an end wall 18 azith a peripheral skirt 20 projecting axially therefrom for receiving the mouth portion 12 of the container 10. The skirt 20 has a free end 22 opposite the end wall 18 of the cap 16. nen the cap 16 is mounted on the container 10 in the closed and locked position shown in FIGURE 3, it is biased against movement from locked engagement with the container 10 by a one piece plastic spring and sealing member designated collectively by reference numeral 25. The inner surface of the skirt 20 of the cap is fo Ted with retention means for the sealing member 25, as well as cap locking means. The retention means is in the form of a pair of semicircular riss 24 projecting inwardly from the skirt 20.The sealing member 25 engages the retention ribs 24 to prevent axial separation of the spring and sealing member 25 from the cap 16. The cap locking means includes at least two sets of cap locking elements. Each set of cap locking elets is disposed in a helical path on the inner surface of the skirt 20. Each set of cap locking elenents includes an elongated rib 26 having a trailing end 26a and a leading end 26b FIGURE 1 .The trailing end 26a is located axially between the retention ribs 24 and the leading end 26b The trailing end 26a of each rib 26 defines the trailing end of of the helical path of each set of locking elements on te cap 16. The cap locking elements also include a pair of spacel locking lugs 28 and 30, the locking lug 30 being located at the leading end of the helical path. The locking lug 28 is located between locking lug 30 and the leading end 26b of the rib 26. The spring and sealing member 25 comprises a one piece molded plastic body having an annular sealing portion which, when the closure assembly is applied to the container 10 as illustrated in FIGURE 3, engages the rim 14 and the inner surface 27 of the mouth portion of the container 10. The sealing portion of the member 25 includes a cylindrical sealing wall 3t having an outer surface 35 for engaging the inner surface of the mouth of the container 10, and a flange 36 projecting radially outwardly from tfe upper or outer end of the sealing wall 34 for overlying the container rim 14. In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of axially spaced ribs 37 are formed on the surface 35 of the sealing wall 34. The spring and sealing member 25 includes a dome shaped plunger portion 32 having a cylindrical base portion 42 which is concentric with the sealing wall 35. The base portion 42 engages the inner surface of the end wall 18 of the cap 16. In the illustrated embodiment, a cylindrical projection 44 is formed on the inner surface of the end wall 18 of the cap 16 for cooperating with the base portion 2 to maintain the spring member 25 centered with respect to the cap 16. The base portion 42 is formed with a closure portion 40 at the inner end of the cylindrical wall of the base portion 42. Extending between the lower end of the base portion 42 and the inner end of the sealing wall 3t opposite flange 36 is a side wall 38. The side wall 38 is of annular crosssection, and flares outwardly in bell shaped configuration from the periphery of the lower end of the base portion 42 to the periphery of the lower, inner end of the sealing wall 34. trlnn the sealing member 25 is installed in the cap 16, it is pressed toward the end wall 18 until flange 36 snaps over the retention ribs 24 as shown in FIGURE 1. The outer surface of the mouth portion 12 of the container 10 is formed with container locking means. The container locking means includes at least two sets of container locking elements. Each se of container locking elements includes an elongated helical guide rib 50, and a par of spaced stop mergers 52 and 54 located at the leading end of the guide rib 50. The stop members 52 and 54 are located in a second helical path on the container 10 offset frorn the helical path of the guide rib 50. A locking ramp or connector portion 56 connects the leading end of the guide rib 50 with th stop r. iembnr 52. rrThen the cap 16 is placed on the container 10, the mouth portion 12 is received in the skirt 20 of the cap 16. As the cap 16 is rotated, the locking lugs 28 and 30 each engage one of the guide ribs 50 beginning at the trailing end thereof opposite the locking ramp 56.As the cap 16 is rotated, the guide ribs 50 cause the locking lugs 28 and 30 to pull the cap 16 axially toward the container 10 and sirultaneously force the sealing member 25 into the mouth portion 12 of the container 10 so that the surface 35 and ribs 37 engage tne mouth portion 12 of the container 10 with a it fit. tThen the locking lug 30 reaches the rar 56, the sealing member 25 is in tight, sealing relationship with the container 10 with the ribs 37 and the sealing wall surface 35 in tight sealing engagement with the inner surface of the container mouLh portion 12.As the lugs 30 and 28 are moved passed the locking ramp 56, the position illustrated in FIGURE 6 , the sealing member is flexed doamwardly because of the reaction between the flange 36 and rim 14 of the container 10. When the locking lugs 28 and 30 reach the position illustrated in FIGURE 6 such that stop member 54 is located between lugs 28 and 30, and lug 28 is located between the stop members 52 and 54, the spring portion of member 25 urges the lugs 28 and 30 into the locked position illustrated inFIGURE 3. The engagement of the locking lugs 28 and 30 with the stop members 52 and 54 prevents rotation of the cap 16 relative to the container 10. The engagement of ribs 26 with the guide ribs 50 as shoam in FIGURE 3 prevents axial separation of the cap 16 from the container 10. In order to remove the cap 16 from the container 10, it is necessary to press the cap 16 toward the container 10 against the biasing force of member 25 to disengage lugs 28 and 30 from the stop members 52 and 54 as illustrated in FIGURE 6.Reverse rotation of the cap 16 then permits the cap 16 to be axially withdraw from the container 10. ine engagement of the flange 36 with the retention ribs 24 causes the spring and sealing member 25 to separate from the container 10 with the cap 16. If it is desired not to lock the cap 16 to the container 10 as shotdn in FIGURE 3, rotation of the cap 16 relative to the container 10 can stop when the lugs 30 engage the respective locking rale.ps 56. In this position, the spring and sealing member 25 will be in sealing engagement with the mouth portion 12 of the container 10, and it will not be necessary to press the cap 16 axially toward the container 10 before removing it. The cap 16 illustrated in FIGURES 1 5 is made of molded plastic material. FIGURE 7 illustrates a modified form of the cap 16 having the same com ponents but made of metal. The cap 116 includes all end wall 118 with a skirt 120 projecting from the peripllery thereof to an outer free end 122. The retention ribs 124 in FIGURE 7, corresponding to ribs 24 of FIGURE 1, are deformed out of the material of the skirt 120 by 2 stamping or pressure forming operation.Similarily, the ribs 126 and lugs 128 and 130, corresponding respectively to ribs 26, 28 and 30 of the previously described embodiment, are stamped or otherwise depressed out of the material of the skirt 120. A projection 144 is punched out of the end wall 118 of the metal cap 116 and surrounds an opening. Again, with reference to the drawings, a second safety closure and container assembly according to the erModim.ent cf FIGURES 8 12 Includes a container designated generally by reference numeral 210 and having a neck or mouth portion 212 with an annular rim 214. The safety closure assembly of FIGURES 8 12 includes a cap 216 made of molded plastic material and having an end wall 218 with a p2risheral skirt 220 projecting axially therefrom for receiving the mouth portion 212 of the container 210. The skirt 220 has a free end 222 opposite the end wall 218 of the cap 216. s Snen the cap 216 is mounted on the container 210 in the closed and locked position shown in FIGURE 9, it is biased against movement from locked engagement with the container 210 by a one piece plastic spring and sealing limber designated collectively by reference n r.eral 225. The inner surface of the skirt 220 of the cap is formed with retention means for the sealing member 225, as well as cap locking means. The re tent ion means is in the form of a plurality of retention nibs 224 projecting inwardly from the skirt 220. The sealing member 225 engages the reLention nibs 224 to prevent axial separation of the spring and sealing member 225 from the cap 216. The cap locking means includes at least to sets of cap locking elements. Each set of cap locking elements is disposed in two helical paths on the inner surface of the skirt 220. Each set of cap locking elements includes an elongated rib 226 having a trailing end 226a and a leading end 226b FIGURE 8 . The trailing end 226a is located axially between the retention ribs 224 and the leading end 226b. The trailing end 226a of each rib 226 defines the trailing end of the first helical path of each set of locking elements on the cap 216. The cap locking elements also include a pair of spaced locking lugs 228 and 230, the locking lug 230 being located at the leading end of the second helical path. The locking lug 228 is located between the locking lug 230 and the leading end 226b of the rib 226 and is integrally formed with the rib 226 at the leading end 226b. The locking lug 228 and the rib 226 together define a z thread or rib. The spring and sealing member 225 comprises a one piece molded plastic body having an annular sealing portion which, when the closure assembly is applied to the container 210 as illustrated in FIGURE 9 , engages the rim 214 and the inner surface 227 of the mouth porLion of the container 210. The sealing portion of the member 225 includes a cylindrical sealing wall 234 having an outer surface 235 for engaging the inner surface of the mouth of the container 210, and a flange 236 proejecting radially outwardly from the upper or outer end of the sealing wall 234 for overlying the container rim 214. In the illustrated embodiment, a pair of axially spaced ribs 237 are formed on the surface 235 of the sealing wall 234. The spring and sealing member 225 includes a dome shaped plunger portion 232 having a cylindrical base portion 242 which is concentric with the sealing wall 235. The base portion 242 engages the inner surface of the end wall 218 of the cap 216. In the illustrated ertbOdiment, a cylindrical projection 244 is formed on the inner surface of the end wall 218 of the cap 216 for cooperating with the base portion 242 to maintain the spring merger 225 centered with respect to the cap 216. The base portion 242 is formed with a closure portion 240 at the inner end of the cylindrical wall of the base portion 242. Extending between the lower end of the base portion 242 and the inner end of the sealing wall 234 opposite flange 236 is a side wall 238. The side wall 238 is of annular crosssection, and flares downwardly and outwardly in a bell shaped configuratioc from the periphery of the lower end of the base portion 242 to a flange portion 245 which integrally connects the side wall 238 to the periphery of the lower, inner end of the sealing wall 234.When the sealing n mber 225 is installed in the cap 216, it is pressed toward the end wall 218 until flange 236 snaps over the retention nibs 224 as sho ç7n in FIGURE 8. The outer surface of the mouth portion 212 of the container 210 is formed with container locking means. The container locking means includes at least two sets of container locking elements. Each set of container locking elements includes an elongated helical guide rib 250, and a pair of spaced stop members 252 and 254 located at the leading end of the guide rib 250. The stop members 252 and 254 are located in the first helical path on the container 210.Offset above the helical path of the guide rib 250 are a pair of spaced vertical stop members 253 and 255. The stop embers 253 and 255 are located at the leading end of the guide rib 250 and in a second helical path on the container 210. The stop member 253 is integrally formed with the stop member 252.Each set of container locking elements also includes a stop means or a check member 257 also located at the leading end of the guide rib 250. The check member 257 is located in a third helical path of the container 210 offset below the helical path of the guide rib 250. A connector portion 256 also disposed in the first helical path integrally connects the leading end of the guide rib 250 with the stop member 252. When the cap 216 is placed on the container 210, the mouth portion 212 is received in the skirt 220 of the cap 216. As the cap 216 is rotated, the locking lugs 228 and 230 each engage one of the guide ribs 250 beginning at the trailing end thereof opposite the connector portion 256. As the cap 216 is rotated, the guide ribs 250 cause the locking lugs 228 and 230 to pull the cap 216 axially toward the container 210 and simultaneously force the sealing member 225 into the r ollth portion 212 o E the container 210 so that the surface 235 and ribs 237 eye the mouth portion 212 of the container 210 with a tight fit. When the locking lug 230 reaches the connector portion 256, the sealing ember 225 is in tight, sealing xelationship with the container 210 with the ribs 237 and the sealing wall surface 235 in tight sealing engagement with the inner surface of the container mouth portIon 212.As the lugs 230 and 228 are moved passed the connector portion 256, the position illustrated in FIGURE 12 , the sealing member is flexed downwardly because of the reaction between the flange 236 and rim 214 of the container 210. When the locking lugs 228 and 230 reach the position illustrated in FIGURE 12, further movement of the lugs 230 and 228 is stopped by the check m mber 257 which engages the lug 230 if the cap 216 is further rotaxed. As shown in FIGURE 12, the stop member 254 is located between lugs 228 ad 230, and lug 223 is located between the stop members and 254, the spring portion of the member 225 urges the lugs 228 and 230 into te locked position illustrated in FIGURE 9.As shown in FIGURE 9, the locking lugs 228 and 230 engage the stop members 253 and 255 to prevent the cap 216 from cocking or tilting on the container 210 when locked. The engage .flent of the locking lugs 228 and 230 with the stop members 252 and 254 prevents rotat on of the cap 216 relative to the container 210.The engagement of ribs 226 with the guide ribs 250 and the engagement of the lugs 228 and 230 with the stop members 253 and 255, respectively, as silown in FIGURE 9 prevents axial separation of the cap 216 from the container 210. In order to remove the cap 216 from the container 210, it is necessary to press the cap 216 toward the container 210 against the biasing force of member 225 to disengage lugs 228 and 230 from the stop members 252 and 254 and the stop members 253 and 255 as illustrated in FIGURE 9. Reverse rotation of the cap 216 then permits the cap 216 to be axially withdralm from the container 210. The engagement of the flange 235 with the retention nibs 224 causes the spring and sealing member 225 to separate from the container 210 with the cap 216. If it is desired not to lock the cap 216 to the container 210 as shown in FIGURE 9, rotation of the cap 215 relative to the container 210 can stop when the lugs 230 engage the respective connector portions 256. In this position, the spring and sealing member 225 will be in sealing engagement with the mouth portion 212 of the container 210, and it will not be necessary to press the cap 216 axially toward the container 210 before removing it. While Specific forms of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing specification, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact construction shown. To the contrary, alterations in the construction and arrangement of parts, all falling within the scope and spirit of the invention, will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
