# Vinylphenyl benzimidazole derivatives, their polymers, their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Novel benzimidazolyl compounds which are basic com pounds and have high polymerizability are disclosed. The basic compound of the present invention is prepared by reacting a vinylbenzaldehyde with an o phenylenediamine compound, and can be used, for example, as a monomer for polymers. The benzimidazolylstyrene compounds are readily homopolymerized or copolymerized to provide li near homopolymers, linear copolymers or cross linked co polymers having pendant benzimidazolylphenyl groups. These polymers have greater resistance to oxidation and chemicals than the homologues, and are useful as ion ex change resins, and as extractants of metals.
