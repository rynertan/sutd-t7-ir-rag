# Solar cell made from amorphous superlattice material.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device which includes an active region including a superlattice amorphous material wherein the energy gap has a predetermined value. A preferred embodi ment of the device is a solar cell. In another embodiment of the present invention, the device is a tandem solar cell which includes a first active region including a superlattice material wherein the bandgap has a first predetermined value a second active region including a second superlattice material wherein the bandgap has a second predetermined value different from said first predetermined value a means for electrically interconnecting said first and second active regions such that current may flow between said first and second active regions.
