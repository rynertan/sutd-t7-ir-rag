# Speed control apparatus for a synchronous motor.

## Abstract
A speed control apparatus for a synchronous motor is provided with a resolver 2 fixedly connected to a rotor 7 of the motor 6 , which produces a phase modulated signal corresponding to an angular position of revolving magnetic field in the motor, a circuit 50 for converting the phase modulated signal into a rotational speed signal of the motor, a phase compensation circuit 52 for advancing in phase a reference signal in accordance with the rotational speed signal, a multiplier 8 for multiplying the phase modulated signal and a rotational speed instruction signal V , a synchronous rectifier 14 for synchronously rectifying the output of the multiplier 8 by an output of the phase compensation circuit 52 , and a current control loop circuit 16 for receiving an output of the synchronous rectifier 14 and for producing a signal having a phase angle delayed as much as the phase angle advanced in the phase compensa tion circuit.
