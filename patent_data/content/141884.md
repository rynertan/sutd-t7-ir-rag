## Description
NOVEL PHENYLPIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR PREPARINGTHEM AND THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to meta substituted phenylpiperazine derivatives that have valuable therapeutic properties as non narcotic analgesics, and to a process for preparing them. It also relates to therapeutic compositions comprising as active ingredient one of these derivatives, for oral, rectal or parenteral administration. According to Manoury et al., J. Med. Chem. 22, 5, 554 1979 , the esterification of certain quinoline anthranilic acids used as antiinflammatory and analgesic agents in clinical practice with phenylpiperazinyl alkanols gives rise to compounds with increased analgesic activity and reduced anti inflammatory activity, so that they are less ulcerogenic. The compounds are better absorbed by virtue of their increased liposolubility. The compound 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid is well known and widely employed in general clinical practice as an antiinflammatory analgesic.In the hope of obtaining compounds with higher analgesic activity and lesser degree of toxicity, we have prepared several derivatives of the 2 4 isobutylphenyl butyric acid of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1, is an ethyl group and R2 is a hydrogen or chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group see SpanishPatent No. 515,541 . The compounds were found to have interesting analgesic properties and low toxicity. We have now found that the compounds of general formula EMI2.2 wherein R1 equivalent to R2 in Formula I represents a hydrogen or chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group have a therapeutic index ratio of LD50 ED50 higher than those of their individual components and that they have more reduced antiinflammatory properties and better absorption and bioavailability due to their increased liposolubility.The compounds of Formula Ia have been found to have very surprising analgesic properties and pharmacological studies have shown that they do not exhibit the harmful side effects of narcotic type analgesics probably because so it is believed their mechanism of action does not involve the same type of receptors. The compounds of general formula Ia may be also used as medicaments in the form of the free bases as well as under the form of the physiological acceptable salts obtained from the addition of organic or inorganic acids hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, maleic acid to the piperazinyl nitrogens. The invention also provides processes for preparing the general formula Ia. One such process involves esterifying a phenylpiperazinyl ethanol of general formula EMI3.1 wherein R2 represents a hydrogen or chlorine atom or trifluoromethyl group with 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionyl chloride EMI3.2 The reaction can be carried out at low temperatures 5 C and in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate or pyridine. Compounds of formula II may readily be obtained by reaction of the corresponding phenylpiperazine EMI3.3 wherein R2 repesents a hydrogen or chlorine atom or trifluoromethyl group with 2 chloroethanol.An alternative process for preparing a compound according to the invention involves esterifying 2 chloroethanol with the acid chloride III to give the compound EMI4.1 which upon subsequent reaction with a phenylpiperazine of formula IV in a basic medium yields a compound of formulaIa. The compounds of the invention can be presented for administration to human beings by the oral, rectal or parenteral routes in the form of the free bases as well as in the form of their physiologically acceptable salts.For oral administration they may be presented in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, sugar coated tablets, suspensions or solutions. These preparations may incorporate acceptable auxiliary agents as talc, magnesium stearate, vegetable gums, sucrose, mannitol, lactose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, a tween surfactant and flavouring and colouring agents. For rectal administration they may be presented as suppositories containing a compound of the invention together with neutral fats such as mono , di and triglycerides of fatty acids or polyethyleneglycols. The compounds of the invention may be presented for parenteral use in association with an appropriate hydroalcoholic vehicle and with an antioxidant and heavy metal chelating agents. The unit dosage presentations may contain 100 to 700 mg of a compound according to the invention as active ingredient. Unit dosage forms for oral administration preferably contain 200 to 500 mg of the compound, those for parenteral administration preferably contain 100 to 200 mg, and suppositories preferably contain 500 700 mg thereof. Such preparations may be made by methods well known in the art, and the active ingredients of the present invention may also be incorporated into the novel composition with other known therapeutically active compounds. The studies of analgesic activity for these compounds have been carried out over 2,178 mice by using the writhing test method. 2 Phenylbenzoquinone was used as nociceptive agent and the material under test was administered by the oral route. In all the cases theED50, ED16 and ED84 minimum dose for each product which reduces the writhes by 50, 16 and 848 respectively were calculated, as well as the 95 confidence limits for theED50. The oral acute toxicity study LD50 determination has been performed using 770 Swiss mice half males and half females weighing 18 22 g.A. Analgesic activity ED5n A slight modification of the method described byHendershot and Forshait J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 125, 237 1959 which employs as nociceptive agent a 0.02 hydroalcoholic solution of 2 phenyl 1 4 benzoquinone, was used. 0.2 ml Of this solution was administered by the i.p. route at a constant temperature of 370 C. The administration of this substance produced in the animals abdominal writhes which were easy to count. The animals used were female Swiss mice of weight 20 2 g. The products to be studied, i.e. the compounds of the invention, phenylpiperazinoethanols of formula II and 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid, were administered to the animals by the oral route one hour before the administration of the nociceptive agent. The value ofED50 was calculated according to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 99, 96 1949 .B. Acute toxicity LDEn This test was carried out by administering the compounds of general formula I, the reference compounds phenylpiperazinoethanols of formula II and 2 4isobutylphenyl propionic acid suspended in Tween 80 by gastric sondage at different dose levels. The doses administered were within those that do not produce any death in the animals LDo, and those killing all the animals LD100 during a 7 day observation period. The calculation of LD50 was made according to Litchfield andWilcoxon, and when this method could not be used, the method described by Reed and Muench Am. J. Hyg. 27, 493 1938 was employed. The results of these studies together with the ratio between LD50 and ED50, which gives an idea of the therapeutic margin of each product are shown in tables 1 and 2. The invention is further described in the following examples.Example 1 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid chloride To a 250 ml flask provided with a magnetic stirrer containing 20.6 g 0.1 mol of 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid was added 11 ml 0.15 mol of thionyl chloride and 1 ml of pyridine. The mixture was left at room temperature for a period of 3 hours, after which it was evaporated under vacuum. 100 ml Of toluene were then added and the mixture evaporated again. The residue obtained was used without further purification. In this manner 19.9 g 858 of 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid chloride were obtained.Example 2 2 4 3 chlorophenyl l piperazinyl ethanol 24.2 ml Of 2 chloroethanol were added slowly from a dropping funnel to a mixture of 46.8 g of l 3 chlorophenyl piperazine and 38.2 g of sodium carbonate in 300 ml of ethanol in a flask provided with mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser. The mixture was heated at reflux for 30 hours and then was filtered and washed with 100 ml of chloroform. The solvent was distilled off to dryness and the residue recrystallized from ethyl acetate to yield 52.3 g 91 of a solid with a melting point of 98 100 C.
