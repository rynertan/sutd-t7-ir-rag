# Programmable cardiac pacemaker.

## Abstract
A programmable pacemaker apparatus having means for receiving programme information from an external source, means for generating and delivering stimulus sig nals, means for sensing the occurrence of natural heart beats in a patient, and a battery source powering the apparatus. A microprocessor 50 combined with program instructions stored in a memory controls the operation of said pacemak er. A controller circuit means external to said microprocessor and interconnected therewith for controlling its operating state has means for determining the occurrence of given events. Said controller means further comprises means for stopping operation of said microprocessor on command from said microprocessor and for starting operation of said microprocessor upon determination of one of said events, whereby said microprocessor normally is on less than about 25 of the time. The pacemaker offers selectable flywheel and overdrive modes.
