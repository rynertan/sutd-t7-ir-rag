# Improvements relating to the lining of pipelines and passageways.

## Abstract
The invention provides that in inserting a resin impreg nated liner into a pipeline or passageway and shaping same to the passageway surface, followed by curing of the resin to form a rigid lining inside the pipeline or passageway, there are placed in the passageway reinforcing circumferential coils or members which bond to the liner and provide extra resistance to compressive hoop stress.
