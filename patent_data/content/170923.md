# Resin composition and laminate produced therefrom.

## Abstract
A resin composition comprising a prepolymer of homo polymer or copolymer of isocyanuric acid derivative or cyanu ric acid derivative, and a cyclized polybutadiene can give a lam inate for multi layer printed circuit boards excellent in heat re sistance, dimensional stability and high frequency electrical properties.
