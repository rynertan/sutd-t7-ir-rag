# Ceiling construction with access door.

## Abstract
A ceiling construction for buildings comprises a plurality of flanged main beams 11 disposed in a predetermined spaced relationship to each other and bridging wall mould ings opposed and spaced to each other a plurality of flanged cross beams 12 connected to the main beams 11 in a predetermined spaced relationship to each other at right angles to the main beams 11 so as to form a ceiling framework a ceiling wall 13 mounted to the ceiling framework so as to form an access opening 21 in a predetermined position a pair of auxiliary beams 14 a plurality of fastening means 15 for the auxiliary beams 14 an access door 16 and a plurality of mounting means 17 for the access door. The pair of auxiliary beams 14 each is bridged in a predetermined relationship flanges the opposite main beams 11 of the main beams 11 adjacent to and spaced to each other or flanges of the opposite cross beams 12 of the cross beams 12 adjacent to and spaced to each other in the access opening 21 on the ceiling wall 13 . Further, the opposite ends of the auxiliary beams 14 are secured to one of the main and cross beams 11, 12 by the fastening means 15 . Furthermore, the access door 16 is positioned in the access opening 21 , and is secured to the ceiling framework by the use of the auxiliary beams 14 and mounting means 17 .
