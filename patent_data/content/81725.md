# Projectors headlights of vehicles that do not dazzle the eyes at the time of their meeting.

## Abstract
Based on the principle that the human eye can only be dazzled if it can see the focus of the light, the head lamp is produced for preventing the driver of a vehicle from having his vision impaired by dazzle from the headlamps of an oncoming vehicle. The device for preventing headlamp dazzle, consists of a stack of spaced apart non transparent plates being mounted in front of the headlamp. The individual plates are quite thin and the spacing between adjacent plates is approximately equal to the plate thickness. The plates have a significant length in the direction of the fore and aft axis of the vehicle and the headlamp is tilted very slight downwards, such that an observer looking horizontally no longer has a clear view through the gaps in the stack of plates and therefore with this arrangement the driver of one vehicle cannot see the focal point of an oncoming vehicle s headlamps and consequently is not dazzled.

## Description
DESCRIPTIONOf the invention that has been declared by DIr. Aristides KOTSIFAKIS son Constantinos, under the brief summary Projectors Headlights of Vehicles that do not dazzle the eyes at the time of their meeting .Based on the principle that the human eye, when it does not see the focus of the light, does not dazzle I have devised the folllowing way that solves the problem of dazzlimg, having to be faced by all drivers of vehicles at the time they meet, coming from the opposite direction. In front of the whole luminous surface of a powerful projector haedlight of a vehicle, I place a series of horizontal plates non transparent, of a very slight thickness, which are at a small and of equal size distances from each other, having a length Drawing I, Drawing 2 . When the system of the projector Headlight plates is at an horizontal position and on the same straight line with the eye, then the eye sees the focus of the projector headlight and, consequently, it dazzles. te divert the system from its horizontal position at one angle downwards, so that the beginning of the length of the one plate Elevation,Drawing 3 e covers the end of the immediately next one. Drawing 3 . This way, we prevent the eye from seeing the focus of the projector headlight Drawing 3, B and, therefore, it ceases to get dazzled. On the other hand, the rays of the light carry on being spread on a straight line, following the direction of the inclination of the system. Following the afore mentio ned principle, we can even instead of using one piece plates, divide each pla t divide each plate into two or more parts and place them at a small distance from each other Drawing 4 .Giving that angle to the system, the luminous beam ceases to have an im mense length and inevitably it touches the grout I and termi nates at a certain point In Drawing 3 it is marked with the point C . The distance of the projector headlight from that point is as greater bigger as smaller is the inclination of the system Ci.e as smaller is the angle BAC, Drawing 3 .The small inclination is being achieved by using either plates with a greater bigger length. our a much smaller distance be tween them or both of them. Thus, the beam touches the ground at a greater length, allowing the driver to control the area and, at the same time, not to be dazzling the one coming from the opposite direction, as well as the pedestrians. In order that the projector headlight follows this mathematical inclination, the surface of every plate should be blurred as, otherwise, the inclination increases a little.The result remains the same, regardless of the shape of the projector headlight , if that is it is square, round, ovel etc.The. plates are, always, adjusted to the shape of the projector headlight , maintaining, of course, their horizontal direction and the distance between them. Also, the common window pane does not affect the result. It may, therefore, be used in the front of the plates for protecrive reasons as, for instance, dust, rain etc .Due to the fact that the roads show a convexity curvature and, therefore, a level difference between the drivers, this why we make the projector headlight movable. In its horizontal position the system may be used as the main projector headlight , since it has an immense length yielding better than the alrea dy available ones, as it creates a directed beam. In the first scale downwards, the angle we have mentionipreviously is being formed and it ceases to get blurred. The next of the scales can cover all the cases of the convexity of the roades. Also, one or more having an upwards direction cover the cavities. This way, the driver will be in a position at his own discretion to give the system the angle it will be needing.Furthermore, by keeping the projector headlight in a a firm position, we can only move the plates, either they are made firm with each other or they are independent. These movements are, easily, achieved with the known techniques being applied, that is either mechanically rods or electromagmetically or hydraulically. It is for that reason that I do not suggest any way or motion as I do not consider that point as a part of my invention. In the case of a permanent setting, the system is pleaced with a greater angle downwards, so that it covers the altimetrical altitudinal difference of the convexity between the two vehicles at the distance that we desire to have, in order to by pass. The altimetrical altit dinal difference is being figured aut, according to the specifications of the roads.The projector headlight may have one powerful or more focuses, taking also the appropriate rays of curves.In order that we obtain the greatest efficiency of the system and have the rays not caged encircled , the curve ray of the mirror should follow the types Cprinciples of Physics so that the rays at the time they enter the platesbhave, already, taken a parallel direction with them. For facilitating them, we can build up a cavity at the side of the plates, wherefrom the rays enter. Furthermore, in the front side the convexity at our discretion achieves a greater diffusion of the rays. Having the afore mentioned as granted, we may construct various types of progectors headlights , at our volition, acting as follows Starting, according to how far we want the luminous beam to be from the vehicle, we figure out the length of the plates and the distance among them.The width of the side angle of the progector headlight , that we are going to use, depends on how big we intend the width of the beam to be.The battery of the plates is constructed either with independent plates that have been assembled or with a cast compressed nattery.Materials It can be constructed by using any sort of materials, provided that the material is considered to be economical and satisfactory as far as the endurance strength is concerned, so that extremely thin superfine plates are constructed, capable of remaining inflexible inbening , that is not to warp. Because of the fact that the vehicles vary, as for the height and the speed, a concrete specific system could not have covered all the cases. This is the only reason that I provide the rules of construction only and that I do not suggest any specific ones Cand types in dimensions and power. According to the case,we make the lengthy the width and the distance among the plates, elements that constitute the basic parts of my invention. On the basis of them, any experienced technician can Construct the type that he prefers. The rest of the cons truction elements may combe out as follows,The curve ray of the mirror of the projector headlight fromPhysics, varying in every dimension, whereas the system motion from the given facts of the present technology.
