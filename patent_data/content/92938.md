# Process for the preparation of woven fabrics of low air permeability.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of a woven fabric of low air permeability which comprises preparing a woven fabric by use of a composite fiber of a splitting and severing type, which consists of polyester and polyamide and produces extremely fine fibers of 0.001 to 0.8 denier size, as a warp and or a weft treating thus obtained woven fabric by use of an aqueous emulsion of a swelling agent for polyester and nylon under the conditions where nylon is mainly allowed to swell and then shrink scouring and dyeing the woven fabric and after calendering the woven fabric with the use of heated rollers rotated under pressure.
