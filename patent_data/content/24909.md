# Improvements in solenoids.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a solenoid which functions as a bi directional linear actuator. In one embodiment, the solenoid includes a stator 26 having first and second closed flux carrying paths defined by first and second cores 26, 40 , each having a plurality of concentric cylindrical pole surfaces 32, 34 and 36 43, 44 and 46 respectively and each defining an air gap 38, 48 respec tively between the outermost of the pole surfaces 32, 43 and the second outermost of the pole surfaces 34, 44 . Coils 50, 52, 54, 56, 58 and 60 are provided for generating elec tromagnetic flux in the first and second closed flux carrying paths with the direction of flux flow across the air gaps 38, 48 being substantially radial with respect to the cylindrical pole surfaces. An armature 24 defines a first and a second plurality of concentric cylindrical armature surfaces 73, 74 and 76 78, 80 and 82 respectively . The armature is mounted to be movable in a direction substantially parallel to the pole surfaces with each of the first and second cylindrical armature surfaces overlapping a corresponding one of the concentric cylindrical pole surfaces by an area dependent upon the position of the armature. The area of overlap between the outermost pole surfaces 32, 43 and their respective armature surfaces 73, 78 is substantially equal to the sum of the areas of overlap between the others of the pole surfaces and their respective armature surfaces. The pole surfaces are defined by tapered ring portions of the stator, which portions have non uniform cross sectional areas in the direction parallel to the direction of movement of the armature. Similarly, the armature sur faces are defined by tapered ring portions of the armature with the tapered portions having non uniform cross sectional areas in a direction parallel to the direction of movement of the armature. A plurality of coils 50, 52 and 54 56, 58 and 60 are used to generate the electromagnetic flux in the cores 26 and 40 respectively .
