## Description
RENALLY ACTIVE TETRAPEPTIDES This invention comprises a new group of chemical compounds whose structures are characterized by having a tetrapeptide chain with terminal prolyl groups. The tetra peptides have pharmacodynamic activity especially useful for improving renal function leading to anti hypertensive activity. The new compounds of this invention are represented by the following structural formula EMI1.1 in which R is hydrogen or lower alkyl of 1 3 carbons R1 is hydrogen, phenyl or phenyl optionally substituted with l or 2 hydroxy or methoxy groups Rê is hydrogen, lower alkyl of 1 3 carbons, phenyl or phenyl optionally substituted with 1 or 2 hydroxy or methoxy groups and Y is hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy X is O or H,H and n and m are each integers from 0 4. A subgeneric group of the new compounds of this invention are those represented by formula I in which X isO R is methyl, R1 is phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl as described above and m is 0. Species of high renal activity are the compounds in which R is hydrogen or methyl, R1 is phenyl, R2 is hydrogen, n is 3, m is 0 and X is 0 especially in theL prolyl DL a methylphenylalanyl glycyl L proline or L prolyl L phenylalanyl glycyl L proline configurations. Certain of these compounds include the various pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the invention such as those formed with nontoxic acids due to the basicN member of the N phenylalkylprolyl fragment formula I when X is H,H or those formed by reaction of a carboxylic acid group with pharmaceutically acceptable bases such as the alkali metal hydroxides. The former include the sulfate, hydrochloride, phosphate, hydrobromide, ethanedisulfonate, methanesulfonate and the like. The latter include the sodium, potassium, calcium salts as well as other nontoxic salts with strong organic bases.The alkali metal salts are most useful as intermediates rather than as end products although they may be used either way. The salts are formed by reacting the compounds of formula I in a suitable solvent with an appropriate acid or base, using reaction conditions which will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Usually, an excess of the inorganic acid or base is reacted with the compound of this invention dissolved in water or in an appropriate organic solvent such as aqueous ethanol. The compounds of this invention often form solvates such as hydrates or lower alcoholates. The tetrapeptides in the form of the free acids are most useful compounds of this invention. Further the acid forms of formula I may be used in pro drug forms, such as a lower alkyl ester derivative of from 1 5 carbons in said alkyl group or such as a benzyl or other ester like group. The compounds of this invention are conveniently prepared by reaction sequences using standard peptide coupling reactions which involve as a key step the formation of the amide bond by the two dipeptide subunits. Most useful is reacting the carboxylic acid bearing fraction, II below, with the amine bearing fraction III in the presence of a dehydrating coupling agent common in the peptide art. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is used under conditions which employ reacting it with the dipeptide subunits in a suitable organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylacetamide or dimethylformamide at moderate temperatures, for example at ambient temperature. Reaction Sequence AEMI3.1 In Reaction Sequence A, X, Y, n, m, R, R1 andR2 are as described above for the compounds of Formula I or precursors therefor, R3 is an easily removed carboxylic acid protective group such as a benzyl or allyl group which can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The carboxylic acid bearing dipeptide II is prepared from known starting materials by N alkylation orN acylation of proline or, preferably, an ester of proline as known to the art, then, condensation of the resulting compound with the desired alanine derivative using standard peptide coupling reactions. The amine bearing dipeptide III is prepared from known starting materials by reacting a N protected glycine, such as t boc. derivative, with a proline ester, followed by regeneration of the amine function. Of course, the order of condensation in building the tetrapeptide chain may be altered as will be recognized by one skilled in the art. The condensation of two dipeptides is more convenient than is the condensation of a tripeptide with a suitable amino acid. The chemical protective devices on any functional groups in the compounds of structure IV are then removed.For example, in the most useful route of synthesis, that iSI when R3 in structure IV is an ester forming group susceptible to removal by catalytic hydrogenation such as benzyl or a substituted benzyl group, the intermediate compound is treated in an organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol over a palladium catalyst under moderate hydrogenation conditions to give the desired end product of this invention. The tetrapeptide products of this invention are also prepared using solid phase or enzyme technology commonly used in preparing peptides. The compounds of this invention have renal pharmacodynamic activity and, as such, are useful pharmaceutical compounds. More specifically, their renal effects are similar to those of dopamine but at very low doses. Their improvement of kidney function often appears to be cumulative. These compounds, therefore, are relatively long acting agents for improving kidney function and, thereby, for treating hypertension in patients in need of such treatment. The biological activity of the compounds of formula I was demonstrated by administering the compounds by infusion to anesthetized dogs measuring the mean arterial blood pressure MAP , renal blood flow RBF , renal vascular resistance RVR and heart rate HR .Generally speaking, the compounds demonstrated a decreases renal vascular resistance and increased renal blood flow at doses ranging from one half to one hundred times of that for dopamine in this test procedure. Specific results demonstrating this biologidal utility are included in the examples. The new chemical compounds described above are incorporated into dosage unit forms and used for improving renal function and, thereby, treating high blood pressure. Pharmaceutical compositions containing the peptides of this invention which have peripheral dopaminergic like, or, more specifically, renal function improvement activity are prepared in conventional dosage unit forms by incorporating a compound of formula I, an isomer thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a prodrug derivative thereof with a nontoxic pharmaceutical carrier according to accepted pharmaceutical procedures in a nontoxic amount sufficient to produce the desired pharmacodynamic activity in an animal or human subject. Preferably, the compositions will contain the active ingredient in an active but nontoxic amount selected from about 5 mg to about 500 mg, preferably about 25 100 mg, of active ingredient per dosage unit. This quantity will vary depending on the relative potency of the basic compound, the specific biological activity desired, the route of administration and the conditions of the patient. The methods of using the new compounds of this invention for medical purposes manifest themselves in a number of ways. Broadly speaking, a peripheral dopamine like effect in the form of a specific renal vasodilation is produced in patients in need thereof. The compounds induce an increased renal blood flow, usually at a low dose. The end result will be an anti hypertensive effect and improved renal function. This assertion does not rule out that the described end result may be wholly or partially due to another mechanism of action, one unlike that of dopamine. Alternatively, since the compounds of this invention are selective peripheral dopaminergic like compounds and dopamine itself is useful in the treatment of shock, these compounds, for example the compound ofExample 1 below, may be used to treat shock in the hospital or emergency treatment room when administered intravenously at a dose selected from the range of about 10 200 mcg min of the basic compound for the average human subject. Dopamine, itself, in the dog test procedure outlined above has an ED15 of about 3 mcg kg min. In medical practice, dopamine has utility for treating various hemodynamic imbalances but such uses are not renally selective. The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl monostearate of glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax. Such sustained release products as well as derivatives which may be gradually metabolized to the active parent can be employed to prolong the unique biological activity of the compounds of this invention A wide variety of pnarmaceutical forms can be employed.Thus, if a solid carrier for oral administration is used, the active ingredient can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder, regular or sustained release pellet form or placed in the form of troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will va widely but, preferably, will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as in an ampul together with an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid suspension for oral administration. One skilled in the art will recognize that the compounds of this invention may exist in various configur l tions such as optical isomers or mixtures thereof.Isomeric compounds other than those specifically described here are easily prepared by substituting the amino acid of a selected configuration into the chemical reactions of the examples which illustrate this invention. The following examples are intended to teach the preparation and use of the new compounds of this invention but not to limit its scope. All temperatures are expressed in degrees Centigrade.
