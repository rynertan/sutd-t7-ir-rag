# Rust preventing wax treatment method.

## Abstract
In a rust preventing wax treatment method which is appli cable to automobile bodies already provided with a finish coat of paint, use is made of a wax which possesses not only thixo tropy but also such a temperature sensitive property that the viscosity of the wax decreases when heated and increases again when cooled near to room temperature. In the wax treat ment method the wax and or the article to be treated with the wax is heated and the wax, which is kept under action of a me chanical force to utilize its thixotropy, is applied to desired sur faces of the article. After that the waxed article is cooled near to room temperature. By this method the wax exhibits a very low viscosity when applied to the article and therefore can penetrate even into narrow spaces, and the applied wax soon solidifies as the waxed article is cooled. Therefore, a wax coat ing film of a sufficient thickness can be formed without suffer ing from dripping of the applied wax.
