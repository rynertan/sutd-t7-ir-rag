# Modified cross section handlebars for bicycles.

## Abstract
This invention relates to cycle handlebars, for mounting on a handlebar stem and supporting at least one brake and or gear control lever 2 , said handlebars having a handlebars body 10 having a central mounting portion 11 . Known such handlebars create significant air turbulence especially during high speed cycling and thus result in increased air resistance. According to the present invention there is provided a pair of extension members 20 extending outwardly of the central mounting portion 11 along the trailing side of the handlebars body 10 on respective sides of the central mount ing position 11 each said extension member 20 having, in transverse cross section, on one side a generally hemi elliptical shape and on its opposite side a concave surface 21 formed to fit the predetermined cross sectional shape of the handlebars body 10 at said trailing side thereof.
