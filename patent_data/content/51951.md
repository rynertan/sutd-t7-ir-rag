Electrical access to the conduc tors is achieved via a contact plug 4 and a series of spaced en try apertures 30 which are shaped to receive the plug in a par ticular orientation. Safety door means 33, 42 are provided in the conduit for each aperture and are designed to prevent con tact with the conductors by means other than the correct entry plug.
