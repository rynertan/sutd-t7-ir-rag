# Breathing aid device.

## Abstract
A breathing device 10 which provides for heat ex change relationship between exhaled air, body heat and inhaled air is the subject of the present invention. A mask 12 is utilized to cover the mouth and nose of the wearer and this mask has an air intake port 22 which is coupled with an air intake conduit 26 . The conduit is provided with first 28 , second, third 30 and fourth conduit stretches which are adapted to be disposed around the neck of the wearer on opposite sides of the head. The air intake conduit is encased by a muffler 40 which also extends around the head of the wearer. The muffler 40 is provided with insulat ing means extending over a substantial portion of its surface and the insulating layer 50 is provided with a highly reflec tive inner surface 52 . Heat radiating from the body of the wearer will pass through the side of the muffler 40 which is closest to the body where it undergoes heat exchange relationship with inhaled air passing through the conduits 26 . This radiant heat will then be reflected by the afore mentioned reflective surface for still further heat exchange. Meanwhile, exhaled air is also passed through the muffler 40 to gain further heat exchange with the air passing through the intake conduits 26 .
