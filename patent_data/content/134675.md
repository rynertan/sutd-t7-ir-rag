# Perpendicular magnetization type magnetic head.

## Abstract
A perpendicular magnetization type magnetic head comprises a main magnetic pole part 20 wound with a coil 24, for subjecting a magnetic recording medium to magnetic fluxes which pass perpendicularly through a magnetic layer of the magnetic recording medium, a non magnetic part 21a, 21b located on both sides of the main magnetic pole and adjacent to the magnetic recording medium, so as to sandwich the main magnetic pole, and a closed magnetic path forming magnetic pole part 23a, 23b for forming a closed magnetic path of the magnetic flux with respect to the main magnetic pole party. The closed magnetic path forming magnetic pole part has an edge 25a, 25b which is bounded on the non magnetic part. This edge is non parallel to the main magnetic pole part.
