# Process for the manufacture of nitric oxide.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of nitric oxide by the oxida tion of ammonia using a catalyst 1 comprising platinum in which the ammonia conversion efficiency of the process is improved by the use of a palladium catchment trap 2 in which the conventional layers 8 and 10 of palladium scaven ger wire are adjacent to layers 7, 9 and 11 of interstitial preferably woven ceramics material. The preferred ceramics material consists of alumina, silica and boria. Also a catch ment trap comprising layers of ceramics material for use in the process.
