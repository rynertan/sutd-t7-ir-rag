# MOTOR OPERATED MECHANISM

## Abstract
A windscreen wiper mechanism includes a motor driven reciprocating link 112 oscillating on rotary wiper arm shaft 116 via an arm 115 secured to the shaft 116 . A limit switch 117 is slidably mounted on a fixed plate 118 through rivets 130 and an elongate slot 131 and a friction material 132 . An operating member 121 of the limit switch 117 is disposed to be engaged by a member 140 mounted on arm 115 . The limit switch 117 is mounted so that the force required to move it relative to the plate 118 is greater than that required to operate the operating member 121 but less than the maximum force which can be applied by the motor to the arm 115 . The position of the limit switch 117 can thus be initially set automatically. A plate 128 on the body of the switch 117 provides an abutment for the member 140 on the arm 115 so that the overwiping and unwanted locking of the mechanism is prevented by the abutment which is auto matically set in the required position initially.
