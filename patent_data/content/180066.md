# MULTIDROP MODEM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A multidrop high speed modem communication system having a master and a plurality of remote modems, wherein an initial long train sequence provides the necessary modem equalization, wherein subsequent channel commu nications are preceded by a short training sequence. The remote modems, operating as slave modems, include a transmitter pre equalizer, wherein the equalizer coef ficients for each remote to master channel are generated at the master modem and sent to the remote modems. Upon subsequent communications, a slave modem reloads the previous coefficients for its channel into its transmitter equalilizer. Other modem parameters, such as timing, phase, and frequency are reestablished by a short fast train sequence. Thereby, the modems may quickly exchange data without consuming excessive time in equalizing the channel for each remote to master transmission.
