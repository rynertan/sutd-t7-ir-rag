## Description
Title FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR Description Technical Field This invention relates to a fiber optic connector. More specifically, it refers to a fiber optic connector having a stripped optic fiber permanently centered within a terminal of the connector by a crimp. Background of the Invention Accurate alignment of the opposed ends of two connecting optic fibers is critical since misalignment severity reduces trasmission across the connection point. Significant research and development money has, therefore, been expended to create a more perfect alignment. There are many methods for aligning optical fibers in current use. Unfortunately, many of these are bulky, expensive, or not sufficiently accurate to prevent at least some reduction of transmission in the connection area. In the prior art, U.S. Patent 4,176,909, describes a proceB for welding bundles of fibers to a plastic tip of a connector by ultra sound. U.S. Patent 4,193,665, describes a lateral alignment of fiber optic cable by crimping a tubular alignment sleeve around the fiber terminal. U.S. 3,972,585, describes a connector with deformed walls as in the shape of a triangle.In this latter device, crimping is employed for axial connection and not for alignment of fibers. Summary of the Invention According to the present invention, there is provided a fiber optic connector adapted to centrally and permanently locate an optic fiber in a terminal using a simple one step crimping operation. The fiber optic connector of this invention employs a plastic terminal enclosing the stripped end of an optic fiber. The fiber is permanently centered in the terminal by heat crimping or mechanically crimping the walls of the plastic terminal. Thereafter the terminal is aligned with an identical terminal containing an opposing optic fiber in an interconnecting bore. Additionally, the terminals have a pair of slots at their tip, which allow for movement and adaptation to different diameter optic fibers as described in U.S. Patent application Serial No. 050,426, filed June 20, 1979.

Description of the Preferred Embodiment The fiber optic connector chosen for purposes of illustration includes a body 10 having opposed pairs of terminals 12 and an interconnecting bore 14. The terminals are fastened to the interconnecting bore by C rings 16. Each C ring fits into a slot 18 of the terminal. A strain relief is provided by crimping the metal end 20 of the terminal 12 to the insulated fiber optic cable 22. The terminal 12 is prepared by insert molding plastic 24 onto metal crimp arms 20 as shown in Figure 2. The carrier strip 26 supports the terminals 12 until ready for use. Optionally, the metal portion 20 of the terminal 12 can be coated with a plastic such as polyethylene or polypropylene. The insulation layer 28 is partially stripped away before inserting the fiber 30 into the terminal. The fiber core covered only by its cladding is allowed to exit from the tip 32 of the terminal 12 and is cut off close to tip 32.Until ready for inserting into the interconnecting bore 14, a protective end cap 34 as shown in Fig. 3 is placed over the terminal 12. The end cap 34 has a stop 36 which rests on a shelf 38 of the terminal 12. Identical terminals 12 are shown in a cut away longitudinal section at the top and bottom b and c of Fig. 4. This view shows the metal part 20 which is used to crimp the insulated fiber optic cable in a conventional manner to provide a strain relief. The insert molded plastic portion 24 of the terminal 12 has a tip 32 which consists of an exterior surface 40 and an interior surface 42. The tip 32 has two slots 44 which grip the fiber 30. The stripped optic fiber 30 which may be either glass or plastic, is inserted between the two interior surfaces 42 of the terminal 12 and exits slightly from the slots 44 in the tip 32. The terminal 12 has two slots 46 for receiving side walls 48 of interconnecting bore 14. Additionally the terminal 12 has a slot 18 which receives a C ring 16 for permanent attachment to the interconnecting bore 14. It also has an anti rotational slot 50 for receiving the ramp 54 from the interconnecting bore 14. The interconnecting bore 14 has a small light oriface 52 in its mi Ã© where the optic fibers 30 oppose each other.Although the two opposing optic fibers meet in the light orifice 52, they do not touch under normal circumstances. The ramp 54 locks into an anti rotation slot 50 of the terminal 12 as the terminal is shoved over the interconnecting bore 14.The C ring 16 locks each terminal to the interconnecting bore 14. The ramp 54 can be on either side of the interconnecting bore 14 depending on the location of the slot 50 on the terminal 12. Figure 5 shows the two terminals 12 opposing each other in the interconnecting bore 14. The crimp 56 in the terminal tip 32 is formed by three prongs equally spaced apart 1200 .These prongs are pressed into the plastic exterior surface 40 of the terminal tip 32 by a tool in order to permanently crimp the plastic 24 to the stripped optic fiber and simultaneously center it within the terminal 12. More than three prongs can be used to crimp the optic fiber. However, the crimp prongs must be equally spaced or continous in order to insure centering of the fiber in the terminal 12. It is preferred that the plastic terminal tip 32 be heated to its softening point to facilitate crimping. It is also possible to cold crimp using a mechanical method. A bulkhead mount 58 can be used to hold the connector in place. Figure 6 shows the fiber core 30 with its insulation 28 inserted into one end of a terminal 12. The stripped fiber is shown in Fig. 7 with a sectional view through the crimp zone 56.Voids 60 are created by the crimping action. Three prongs are preferred for use in centering the fiber 30. Fig. 7a shows a crimp made by using four instead of three crimping prongs. As an alternate embodiment, pairs of terminals 12 can be inserted into a dual channel interconnecting bore 62 shown inFig. 8 to provide multiple connections. In the embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 8 a single locking ramp 54 is latched by a positive locking latch 68 located within the dual terminal housing 64. A metal strain relief clamp 66 is used around the outer insulation covering the two fiber optic cores. As in the connector of Fig. 5, the ends of the optic fiber is stripped from its insulation prior to insertion into the dual terminal housing 64. The latch 68 shown in Fig. 9 should be made out of metal or high strength plastic. The optic fiber is crimped by exerting a heat crimping device or mechanical crimping to the tip 32 of the terminal 12 before inserting the terminal into the dual channel interconnecting bore 62. A typical crimping tool is shown in Fig. 10. Three prongs 72 actuated by a circular mechanical motion moving the prongs over a cam 74 forces pressure on the plastic of the terminal and causes it to collapse onto the optic fiber 30. This step centers the fiber and permanently affixes the fiber within the terminal 12. Plastic used for the terminals of this invention are polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinylchlonicle with flame retardant, fiber fill. Optic fibers used in this invention are gradient index glass, step index glass, plastic clad silica or step index plastic. These fibers have a diameter between 0,1016 mm to 1,016 mm.The split end slots 44 of the terminal tip 32 allows for variation in the diameter of the fiber. Under normal circumstances the temperature required for heat crimping the plastic is about 1200C.
