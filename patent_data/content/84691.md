## Description
Method for preparing N monoacylated gem diamino derivatives Inversion of the direction of the amide bonds of peptideEMI1.1 peptide analogues to be obtained which besides being an interesting object of study in that they make it possible to determine the relative importance of the side chains and peptide skeleton in biological activity, can find useful practical application in pharmacology because of their high stability to enzymatic degrsdation Goodman tI. and Chorev M, Acc. Chem. Res. 12. 1 1979 and cited references .This modification of the peptide skeleton accompanied when necessary by inversion of the chirality of some of the aminoacid residues in the chain and by the modification of the terminal groups is carried out with the intention of maintaining the topology of the side chains unaltered.The resultant analogues, known generally as retro inverso peptides, are structural isomers which although not exactly identical with the natural reference peptides from the topochemical aspect, can retain their biological activity. In particular, in the case of cyclic peptides and depsipeptides, it has been shown that inversion of the direction of the peptide skeleton accompanied by inversion of each of the chiral centres of the chain produces structural isomers with complete biological activity Shemya Kin M.X., OveÅainnikov, Y.A. and Ivanov, V.T., Angew. Chem. 8, 4S2 1969 . It is apparent that in these compounds the biological activity depends on the three dimensional orientation of the side chains rather than on the structure of the peptide skeleton. In the case of retro inverso analogues of linear peptides with all the peptide bonds inverted, the existence of the terminal groups poses particular problems for maintaining the steric complementarity with the reference peptide.In general, and in the case of linear reference peptides with amino chain terminals and free carboxyls, the problem is solved by transforming the N terminal amincacid residue into a gem diamino residue, transforming the C terminal aminoacid residue into a malonyl residue or a malonyl residue substituted in position 2, and inserting the intermediate residues in the chain with inverted configuration.If not all the peptide bonds of thechain are retro inverted, partially modified retro inverso analogues are obtained in which the modified chain segments are incorporated between normal segments,The inversion of a single peptide bond produces two adjacent non aminoacid residues in which the residue closer to the amino end is of gem diamino type, whereas that closer to the carboxyl end is of malonyl or 2 substituted malonyl type.The extension of the modification to non adjacent peptide bonds leads to inversion of the chirality of the aminoacids interposed between the two non aminoacid residues.Up to the present time, biologically active retro inverso analogues of linear peptides have been synthesised such as angiotensin, bradykinin, luteotropic hormone releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, encephalin, tuftsin, C terminal tetrapeptide of desamino gastrin, 5 9 pentapeptide of melano tropin, Substance P and aspartame Goissis G. et al,, J. 5 ilMed.

Ed.,Scriptor, Copenhagen, 1981, p. 608 .In particular, the synthesis of four analogues of encephalic smide with inversion of the peptide bond between the four and five residues, with or without simultaneous inversion of the terminal carboxyvmide bond1 has produced new and powerful topochemical analogues of the encephalins.In this case, the inversion of part of the amide bonds of the chain has enabled not only the biological activity to be preserved unaltered but also to potentiate it, probably by the effect of the increased resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis in vivo.While the incorporation of the malonyl or 2 substituted malonyl residues into the skeleton of these peptides has not presented particular problems, that of the gemdiaminoa1kyl residues has required special and delicate synthesis manipulations. The sequence of reactions used can be summarised as follows an aminoacid or peptide azide suitably protected at the NH2 is firstly converted into the corresponding isocyanate by means of Curtius rearrangement.The isocyanate intermediate is then subsequently utilised either in reactions with the carboxyl component to give the mixed carbamiccarboxylic anhydride, which by thermal elimination of carbon dioxide produces the desired amide bond, or is captured by reaction with an excess of an appropriate alcohol in general tertiary butyl alcohol or benzyl alcohol to give a new type of urethan protector group for the gem diamino residue.This new amino protector group is eliminated immediately before the condensation reaction with the carboxyl component because of the instability of the gem diamino alkyl derivatives Goodman H. and Chorev M., Acc. Chem. Res., 12, 1 1979 .The isocyanate intermediates are prepared in their turn by three different synthesis procedures a reacting the carboxyl component with diphenylphosphorylamide in toluenes followed by heating in the presence of triethylamine WilsonC.G. et al., in peptides Proceedings of the 5th AmericanPeptide Symposium , Goodman M. and Mienhofer J., Editors, Wiley, New York, 1977, p. 579 b reacting the mixed carbamic carboxylic anhydride under cold conditions with an excess of sodium azide in water to give the corresponding scyl azide, followed by thermal rearrangement Sheehan, J.C.et al., J. Org. Chem. b 4045 1977 c reacting an acyl hydrazide with nitrosyl chloride in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran to give the corresponding azide, followed by thermal rearrangement Honzl Rudinger process Honzl J. and Rudinger J.,Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun. 26, 2333 1961 .We have now devised a method, constituting the subject matter of the present invention which makes it possible to introduce a gem diamino residue into a peptide skeleton in a particularly easy manner without special tedious chemical manipulations, by using IXI bis trifluoroacetoxy iodobenzene. This new reagent has been used recently for the direct conversion of primary carboxyl amides of simple structure into amines under extremely mild reaction conditions without the need to isolate or capture the intermediate isocyanate Rsdhakirishna A.S. et al., J. Org. Chem. 44, 1746 1979 .We have now found that said procedure can be suitably adapted to the direct conversion of primary aminoacid, hydroxyacid, peptide or depsipeptide amides protected at the terminal NH2 or OH, of general formula II, into the corresponding trifluoroacetic acid salts of N monoacylated gem diamino derivatives of general formula I, in accordance with the following scheme EMI6.1 In said formulas P is a benzyloxycarbonyl group Z , a tertbutyloxycarbonyl group Boc , an acyl residue or generally any NH2 or OH protector group stable under reaction conditions A is a residue of an aminoacid or hydroxyacid which can be either natural such as valene, alanine, tyrosine, methionine, lactic acid, mandelic acid etc. or synthetic 4 methylproline, trifluoroalanine etc. R is a hydrogen atom, or an slkyl, phenyl, phenylalkylene, hydroxyphenylalkylene, hydroxyalkylene, aminoalkylene, acylaminoalkylene, guanidinylalkylenc, imidazolylalkylene, indolylalkylene, mercaptoalkylene, alkylmercaptoalkyleneor carboxyalkylene group or their suitable derivatives n is either 0, 1 or greater than 1, in which case the aminoacid sequence represented by A can be constituted by residues which are the same or different and, if different, disposed at random or in predetermined sequence or the sequence represented by A n can be constituted by aminoacid residues which are the same or different, or hydroxyacid residues which are the same or different1 either disposed at random or in a predetermined sequence.The described invention is generally applicable to amides of general formula II, with yields which normally are of the order of 80 90. Pilot reactions are used as required in order to determine the optimum reaction conditions, in particular with regard to the duration of the reaction and the molar excess of reagent. The reaction, carried out under effective sgitation of the initial solution or suspension and bubbling inert gas through the reaction mixture, requires from two to six hours to attain completion.On termination of the reaction, the mixture is evaporated to dryness, the residue is taken up in a suitable organic solvent and treated with a stoichiometric quantity of HC1 dissolved in an organic solvent miscible with the former, to obtain, either directly or by adding a suitable quantity of ethyl ether, the hydrochloride of the gem diamino derivative protected at the terminal NH2 or OH in crystalline form.The final products, prepared in accordance with the described methods, can be isolated in their pure state, by crystallising the hydrochlorides in the case of the shorter peptides and depsipeptides 2 5 residues , or by chromatography separation in the case of more complex peptides. The hydrochlorides of the gem diamino derivatives protected at the terminal NH2 or OH can be preserved without appreciable degradation in an inert gas atmosphere under cold conditions.Two examples are reported hereinafter involving the use of gem diamino derivatives protected at the terminal NH2 in condensation react ions with carboxyl components constituted by aminoacid or peptide derivatives. The carboxyl which participates in the condensation can pertain to aminoacids or malonyl or 2 substituted malonyl residues, either free or bonded to peptide fragments. For example, products of the condensation of gem diamino derivatives with the said carboxyl components induced by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and catalysed by N hydroxybenzotriazole are generally isolated with high yields by the known standard procedures of peptide synthesis.A characteristic of fundalmental importance of this invention is that the described process can be applied with substantially total control of rscemisation. In this respect, we have verified, by appropriate synthesis and the application of high pressure liquid chromatography, that the transformation of the peptide amides Boc Phe Phe NH2 and Boc Phe D Phe NH2 into the corresponding analogues Boc Phe g Phe H.HCl and Boc Phe g D Phe H.HCl where g Phe represents the corresponding gem diamino Phe derivative takes place with substantial configuration retention degree of racemisation undetectable by the analytical methods available .The subject matter and scope of the invention will be more apparent from reading the following examples, which are simply illustrative and must in no manner be considered limitative of the invention.The product purity was demonstrated by reverse phase high pressure chromatography analysis RP HPLC using the following eluent systems H20 acetonitrile 0.01 M N114H2PO4 acetonitrile 0.005 EI heptanesulphonic acid O.Ol M NH4H2PO4 acetonitrile. and chromatography analysis on a thin layer of silica gel using the following eluent systems n butanol acetic acid water 4 1 1 chloroform methanol acetic acid 85 10 5 n butanol isopropanol 1N NH40H ethyl acetate 1 1 5 1 organic phase.
