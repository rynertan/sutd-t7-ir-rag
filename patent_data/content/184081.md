# Perfluoroalkylvinyl polymer and production thereof.

## Abstract
A perfluoroalkylvinyl copolymer comprising 1 repeat ing units of the formula CHRfCH₂ I wherein Rf is a C₅ C₂₁ perfluoroalkyl group, and b repeating units of the formual CHYCHZ or COOR CH₂ II wherein Y is OR¹, OCOR¹ or COOR¹ and Z is a hydrogen atom or COOR² in which R¹ and R² are, the same or different, a C₁ C₁₈ alkyl group with the proviso that when Y is OR¹ or OCOR¹, Z is an hydrogen atom, and R is a C₁ C₁₈ alkyl group, which is useful as a mold release agent, a water and oil repellent and a non tackifier.
