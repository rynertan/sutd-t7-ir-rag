# Ultrasonic transducer.

## Abstract
A real time ultrasonic transducer 10 for use in a scanning system and a novel drive circuit therefor are provided. The transducer includes a housing 12 and a transducer assembly 64 mounted therein for movement in a predetermined manner. An electromagnet 34, 82 causes the transducer assembly 64 to move in such a predetermined manner. The drive circuit 86 reverses the polarity of the voltage applied to the electromagnet 82 when the transducer assembly 64 reaches a predetermined limit of movement thereby reversing the direction of movement thereof. The drive circuit 86 and the transducer assembly 64 are located within the transducer housing 12 . The drive circuit 86 in cludes a set reset R S flip flop that reverses the polarity of the voltage applied to the electromagnet 82 . The two conventional collector resistors of the flip flop are each replaced by a transistor circuit thereby providing the R S flip flop with power amplification capability. The ultrasonic transducer 10 can include a circuit for gen erating a signal related to the actual position of the transducer assembly 64 . That signal is used by the scanning system to synchronize image creation with transducer assembly movement.
