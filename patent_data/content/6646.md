## Description
IMPROVED COFFEE IIKE INSTANT COFFEECRAIN BEVEP9GE The history of the use of coffee substitutes is probably as old as the use of coffee itself. Reasons for their use include 1 lower cost where the substitute material may be substantially cheaper than coffee, 2 lack of availability due te political crisis, weather problems in the producing countries, etc., and 3 caffeine control. Numerous coffee substitutes have been sold in Europe for quite some time and since the recent frost in Brazil several new coffee substitutes have been introduced inAmerica. One of the leading coffee substitutes comprises chicory and coffee base. Another leading coffee substitute comprises wheat, bran, molasses and coffee base.Although such coffee substitutes have found some acceptance, most real coffee drinkers will bear witness that such coffee substitutes do not smell or taste like real coffee and are not as acceptable as 100 real coffee. U.S. Patent No. 3,997,685, December 14, 1976, to Rudolf G.K. Strobel, discloses adding a coffee flavor aroma frost to cereal solids to make a coffeelike product. This patent, however, does not teach the use of refined or deflavored cereal extract solids. It is an object of the present invention to provide the consumer with a coffee grain beverage mix which smells and tistcs like 100i real coffee. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of making a coffee grain beverage mix which smells and tastes like 1002 real coffee. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coffee like coffee grain beverage mix which is as acceptable to real coffee drinkers as real coffee itself. SU A AARY OF THE INVENTION An improved coffee like instant coffee grain beverage mix having an orthodox coffee flavor, taste, and aroma is made from 15 98 wt. refined grain extract, 0 84 wt. coffee base extract, and from 0.05 to about 3.0 wt. of cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds. The refined grain extract is refined by separating characteristic grainy flavor and aroma constituents from the grain or from an aqueous grain extract.The coffee aroma flavor compounds are prepared by collecting low temperature vacuum steam stripped or desorbed coffee aroma and flavor volatiles as a frost by condensation at a cryogenic temperature and an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 to about 200 mm of mercury. An improved coffee like instant coffee grain beverage mix comprising the refined grain extract, the coffee aroma flavor compounds and a coffee base in the said amounts provides a beverage which smells and tastes like real coffee and in its preferred compositions is surprisingly as acceptable as coffee to real coffee drinkers as the leading 100 instant coffees. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved coffee lie instant coffee grain beverage mix having an orthodox coffee aroma and flavor. A beverage made with the mix of this invention is more satisfying to coffee drinkers than previous coffee substitutes.The invention attains chis result from a novel combination of inrcdi.ents. Spccifical , high cjuality coffee aroma flavor comt,ounds are combined with a refined grain extract and a coffee base extract.Taste tests have shown that beverages made from said coffee grain beverage mix are significantly preferred over the current leading coffee substitutes. Sloreorer, expert flavor panels show that the beverages of this invention are as acceptable in coffee flavor and aroma as the leading instant coffees. The composition of the present invention comprises from 15 to 98 wt. refined grain extract powder, 0 84 wt. of coffee base extract, and from 0.05 to 3 wt. e of cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds A preferred composition of the instant coffec grain dry beverage mix of the present invention comprises from about 15 to about 80 wt. g of refined grain extract, from about 1 to about 20 wt. of a coffee aroma flavor concentrate AFC , and from about 29 to 60 wt. of a coffee base extract.The AFC comprises the cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds trapped in an extract matrixA preferred composition made with AFC will preferably provide coffee aroma flavor compounds in an amount of from about 0.1 wt. to about 2.0 wt. t. Sufficient solids must be provided to matrix the aroma flavor compounds in the frost. In general, when using a C02 surge and a single trap, 100 grams of ground coffee will produce about 2 grams of flavor aroma frost of which about 1,800 mg will be water and CO2. The remainder is a complex mixture of about 200 mg of coffee aroma flavor compounds which comprise about 190 mg of organic acids, such as, short and medium chain fatty acids c1 C12 , di and tri carboxylated acids, and other natural and basic aroma flavor compounds, and about 10 mg of phenols and their derivatives.About 2 gm of solids are preferably added to 2 gm of flavol arom,a frost, such solids should be at a concentration of 10 to 70 and preferably about 409 to minimize the amount of water which must be removed in the subsequent drying operation. Additionally and as is well known in the art, the use of higher initial concentration of solids in a flavor and ar ona containing solution to be freeze dried results in lower losses of flavor and aroma. The refined grain extract of this invention is preferably prepared by a distilling and separating grainy flavor and aroma constituents from an aqueous extract of roast and ground grain, said grain extract having an initial soluble solids content of from about 5 to about 25 b concentrating said grain extract to 3G to 608 solids, GS cj trying said concentrated extract. The distilling, separating and concentrating of said grain extract can also be accomplished by a process known as flash or thin film evaporation. Equipment for this operation is a Falling FilmEvaporator, shown in Figure ll 16h and described on pages 11 29 of Chemical Engineers Handbook, 5thEdition, by Perry, Robert H. and Chilton, Cecil H.,McGraw Hill Book Co. 1973. Another preferred method of separating grainy flavor and aroma constituents from an aqueous extract of roast and ground grain comprises a slowly passing water and wet steam through a zone containing roasted and ground grains in such a manner which avoids flooding of said zone and while said zone is held at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 mm to 200 mm of mercury, thereby to provide a continually moving interface between dry and wetted particles of said roast and ground grain b prior to the reaching of said moving interface to the end of said zone and the emergence of a liquid grain extract from said zone, expelling a steam fraction containing objectionable grainy aroma and flavor bodies rcmoved from said roast and ground grain.This liquid grain extract will preferablzrlwave an initial soluble solids content of about 5 to 20 . This aqueous grain extract can be further refined by the processes set out above for aieous grain extracts, or it can be dried without further refining. An alternative method of refining an aqueous grain extract is by passing steam through an aqueous solution containing up to 50 grain extract solids and thereby removing objectionable grainy flavor bodies therefrom. Other alternative methods of making refined grain extract of this invention are also contemplated as within the spirit and scope of the present invention. The grain extract of this invention is prepared from roast and ground grain selected from the group consisting of malted barley, barley rye and wheat, corn, chicory, and soybean. Roasted malted barley having a color of 65 to 95 photovolts is the preferred grain from which the grain extract is made. A most preferred color is 67 to 69. The coffee AFC of this invention is preferably prepared by processes comprising the steps of a desorbing or steam stripping roast and ground coffee at a temperature below 1000C and an absolute pressure of from 0.1 mm to 200 mm of mercury b collecting desorbed or steam stripped coffee aromaflavor volatiles as a frost by condensation at a temperature of below about 730C and at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 mm to about 200 mm of mercury c melting said frost by contacting it with an aqUcoLs ci tract having a soluble solids content of from about 25 to about 659, said extract being selected from the group consisting of extracts of coffee or grain and d drying the melt and extract of step Cc to obtain said coffee AFC.The desorption processesare disclosed in detail in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,717,472 and 3,997,685, to the present inventor,R.G.K. Strobel all of which patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In one preferred process, the coffee aroma flavor compounds are prepared by a pulsing water and wet steam onto a zone con taining roast and ground coffee at a temperature below 1000C and an absolute pressure of from O.lmm to 200mm of mercury b collecting steam desorbed coffee aroma flavor volatile compounds as a frost by condensation at a temperature of below about C and at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 to about 200mm of mercury c melting said frost by contacting it with a sufficient amount of aqueous extract having a soluble solids content of from about 25 to about 65 , said extract.being selected from the group consisting of extracts of coffee or grain and d drying the melt and extract of step c to trap said coffee aroma flavor compounds in a coffee aroma flavor concentrate. In another preferred process, the coffee aromaflavour compounds are prepared by a slowly passing water and wet steam through a zone containing roasted and ground coffee in such a manner which avoids flooding of said zone and while said zone is held at a temperature below 1000C and at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1Em to 200nun of mercury, thereby to provide a continually moving interface between dry and wetted particles of sad roast and ground coffee b prior to the reaching of said moving interface to the end of said zone and the emergence of a liquid extract from said zone c collecting steam desorbed coffee aroma flavor volatile compounds as a frost by condensation at a temperature of below about 730C and at an absolute pressure of from about 0.1 to about 200m.m of mercury d melting said frost by contacting it with a sufficient amount of aqueous extract having a soluble solids content of from about 25 to about 65 , said extract being selected from the group consisting of extracts of coffee or grain and e drying the melt and extract of step d to trap said coffee aroma flavor compounds in an aroma flavor concentrate. In the above processes, preferably the steam desorbed coffee aroma flavor volatile compounds are collected as a frost at an absolute pressure of 80mm of mercury or below, and the frost is melted by contacting it with an amount of said aqueous extract at least of an equal weight as said frost. The most preferred desorption process is set out in U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 722,250, filedSeptember 10, 1976, entitled Improved Stable Aroma andFlavor Products , R.G.K. Strobel, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. According to this process the coffee aroma compounds are prepared by pulsing or continuously passing wet steam into a zone containing said roasted and ground coffee in a manner which avoids flooding said zone and while said zone is held at an absolute pressure of from O.lnrm to 200nun of mercury, thereby providing continuously moving interface between dry and wetted particles of said roast and ground coffee prior to the reaching of said moving interface to the end of said zone and the emergence of an aqueous coffee base extract from said zone, collecting a coffee aroma and flavor containing frost fraction by condensing aroma flavor volatile compounds removed from said roast and ground coffee at a temperature of from 0 0 about 20 C to 200 C thereafter melting said aroma and flavor containing frost fraction with an aqueous extract containing water soluble solids selected from the group consisting of proteins and carboydrates, combining said frost fraction with said aqueous extract at a temperature below about 5 C in a closed container which has been purged with inert gas and which contains no air space surrounding said mixture freezing said mixture with agitation at a temperature in the range of from about 40C to 2000C to provide a frozen mixture wherein the ice crystals exceed 1000 microns comminuting the resultant frozen mixture to a particle size of from about500 to 2000 microns and freeze drying said particles. A notable steam stripping method is that of RichardGregg, co pendir.g U.S. Patent 4,100,305, issued July ll, 1978, and entitled A METHOD OF MAKING AN IMPROVED COFFEEVOLATILES CONCENTRATE, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other alternative methods of cryogenically collecting coffee aroma flavor compounds may be employed in the practice of the present invention. A most preferred embodiment of the present invention corpses a mix containing from about 25 80 wt. of the refined grain extract, from about 5 15 of the AFC and from about 30 60 wt. t of a suitable coffee base, wherein said mix comprises from 0.1 to about 2.0 wt. of said cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds . The coffee base extract of the invention is prepared by conventional coffee extract operations or desorbate processing described in the above mentioned patents and patent application to R.G.K. Strobel, incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLE I A dry, refined grain extract was obtained from 500 g of roasted and ground malted barley. The barley was placed into a 5 ffi glass column. The glass column was closed with a disk shaped lid. The lid was equipped with four openings, a center opening, and three additional openings symmetrically arranged around the center opening. The center opening was used for placing a nozzle above the barley substrate bed. The distance between nozzle opening and substrate bed was 15 cm. Two of the remaining three openings were used for placing thermocouples into and above the substrate bed for temperature measurements during the run two openings . The remaining opening was used for connecting a nitrogen line to the column. The column was evacuated to an absolute pressure of Imam. A condensing trap was placed between the vacuum pump and the column to condense volatile materials from the barley bed. The condenser was cooled with liquid nitrogen. The volatiles were driven off by pulling spurts of boiling H20 through the nozzle. The spurts of hot water were partially transformed into steam approximately 20 steam transformation at lmm vacuum .The steam transformation also caused a temperature reduction of the steam water mixture to 20 C. The water was instantaneously soaked up by the substrate. The water caused the desorption of additional volatiles which were carried by the steam through the substrate bed steam distillation . The volatiles and steam distillable volatiles showed a faint yellowish tint when condensing in the trap. They also gave off a greenish, pungent unpleasant aldehydic aroma. Addition of subsequent water steam spurts Y 10 ccm each onto the substrate pushed the aqueous front deeper into the substrate bed, causing the desorption of additional volatiles, etc. After 13 minutes, a total of 900 ml of water was placed onto the substrate bed, at which point the aqueous front had reached the lower end of the substrate bed. blow, the condenser containing the volatiles and steam distillable materials was replaced by a fresh conden ser. This fraction was discarded. Addition of subsequent water spurts onto the substrate bed causcd the aqueous front, which con tained water soluble refined grain extract pigments, carbohydrates, proteins, inorganic components, etc. to exit into the new condenser. The new condenser was placed into a dry ice solvent mixture. After 38 minutes, 1.9 liters of hot H2O had been placed onto the substrate bed. 1029 ccm of H20soluble grain solids were collected in the trap drawoff ratio 1 2.06 . This aqueous grain extract contained about 28 solids based on the weight of the starting roast and ground malted barley. The aqueous grain extract was frozen, milled, and sieved. Particles ranging from 850 microns to 2000 microns were collected and freeze dried. The dry refined grain extract exhibited a bland flavor. A coffee aroma flavor concentrate, of ExampleII, was uniformly mixed with the dry refined grain extract of this Example at a level of about 70 10 mg per gram of grain extract. The coffee aroma flavor concentrate contained about 3.2 wt. 8 of cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds and about 96.8 wt. coffee base extract. The coffee grain dry beverage mix dontained about 0.21 coffee aroma flavor compounds and 6.3 wt. coffee base extract. A hot beverage prepared with this mix was described by expert coffee tasters as virtually indistinguishable from a 1008 coffee beverage. EXAMPLE IIA. Twenty five kg of coffee beans roasted to a photovolt reading of 70 were quenched, first with one liter of water and then with liquid nitrogen. The water quenchilug was carried out in the roaster Probat roaster . Immediately after water quenching, the beans were dunipcd into metal drums and shock quenched with 20 kg of liquid nitroqen to a temperature of 100C. One kg of powdered Dry Ece was mixed into the quenched beans before grinding. The beans were then ground to a coarse grind instant coffee grind and then inmediately milled on a roses mill with a distance of 88.9 microns 3.5 mils between rolls. Hydraulic pressure on the rolls was 350 lbs. Speed of the rolls was 100 rpm.B. Desorbte Column and Ancillary Equipment The Desorbate Column consisted essentially of four components, namely l. A cylindrical section 60 cm in diameter and 50 cm high. Both ends of this section are ground. 2. A top section, dish shaped with four open ings, receiving a nozzle system for steam water application, C02 purging, and thermocouples for temperafrre measurcents. A hot water reservoir was connected to the nozzle system A solenoid valve was placed between the hot water reservoir and the nozzle system. The top section was placed on a stainless steel ring plate that provided via two O rings, a vacuum tight seal between the cylindrical and top section. The stainless steel ring also provided a means for lifting the top section for filling and discharging the column. 3. A false bottom, consisting of a 55 perfor ated stainless steel plate placed between the cylindrical section and the bottom section. Two O rings provided a vacuum tight seal between the two sections. Seven layers of cheesecloth were placed on the perforated plate to prevent the flaked coffee from falling through when loading the column. 4. A dish shaped bottom, equipped with a valve. The valve extended via vacuum tubing to a con The condensing system was connected to a mechanical vacuum pump. The. pump was pro tected with two cryogenic traps against water vapors. The three column sections, made of Duran glass, were held together by metal flanges. The metal flanges were connected to metal plates which in turn connected to a tubular frame system supporting the entire column setup.C. Loading and Purging the Column The lid section was lifted with a mechanical winch and 20 kg of Coffee flakes were placed onto the false bottom cheesecloth . The coffee flakes were spread out to obtain a level bed surface in parallel with the false bottom plate. The lid was then lowered onto the cylindri cal section and the air above the coffee bed was displaced with CO2. D. Preparation of Aroma Flavor Frost Condensing Vessels The condensing system. consisted of three 8 liter cylindrical flasks 18.7 cm diameter placed in parallel between the column and the vacuum source. The condensing vessels were placed into liquid nitrogen. Each condensing vessel had been previously coated on the inside with 300 grams of a 609 solution of Desorbate coffee base extract obtained fro a previous run 180 grams Desorbate base dissolved in l,O mi of distilled water . The concentrate was poured into the cylindrical vessels and then the vessels were rotated in a near horizontal position until an even coating of concerlt ate was achieved on the inside walls. The vessels were then quickly placed into the liquid nitrogen to freeze the even coating.E. Evacuation of Column After displacing the air from the column and connecting the condensers to the column on the one side and to the vacuum pump on the other side, the vacuum pump was turned on. The bottom valve of the column was only slightly opened to prevent the highly volatile materials from rushing through the condensing system. Evacuation of the column under these delayed conditions took about 10 minutes.F. Desorption and Condensing of Aroma Flavor Frost After evacuating the column to 1 Torr, the solenoid valve was opened by an electrical switch for approximately one second. One half liter of water from the reservoir was pulled into the nozzle system. The nozzle system produced an even spray pattern over the coffee bed. The vacuum in the column caused part 202 of the hot water 99 C to transform into steam. The transformation into steam was accompanied by a temperature drop from 990C to 200C of the steam water mixture. The water was immediately soaked up by the coffee particles and in turn desorbed volatile gases like C2 and coffee aroma flavor compounds from the coffee flakes. The evaporation of the vola tiles was visually observed by the formation of gas bubbles at the interface between the wetted part and the dry part of the coffee bed. As soon as the formation of gas bubbles sub sided, another spurt of hot water was placed onto the column bed. This spurt drove the inter face deeper into the coffee bed. The interface developed without any channeling or uneven migration into the coffee bed. As soon as the coffee particles were saturated with water, dissolution of soluble materials into the aqueous phase occurred as evidenced by the fornation of a dark brown band of solubles. This dark brown band was moved deeper into the coffee bed and renewed activity of volatiles desorption occurred when additional spurts of water were appliedThe subsequent Table gives detailed information on various parameters like tnpexature in and above the coffee bed, the vacuum at the interface and above the column bed, the quantities of water applied, the time elapsed, etc. TABLE I VARIOUS DESORBATE PARAMETERS Temperature C Hot Head Top oxter Time Vaccum of Added tEn.

The volatiles produced a whitish slightly yellow layer of aroma flavor frost in the condensers. The condensers were protected against light during collection of the aroma flavor frost As shown in Table I, the collection of the aroma flavor frost was finished after 30 minutes run time and application of 23 liters of hot water through the nozzle system. At this time, the interphase had advanced to the false bottom and started to break through the layers of cheese cloth. At this point the aroma flavor frost traps were removed from the column system. The traps were sealed with cellulose plugs and kept in the dark in liquid nitrogen jackets until combining with the first liquid Desorbate coffee base effluent extract as described next.G. The First Liquid Desorbate Effluent After removing the aroma flavor frost traps, a single 10 liter capacity trap was placed into the column system. The trap was cooled with liquid nitrogen. After a total of 55 minutes run time and addition of a total of 33 liters of water to the column bed, 3.606 liters of dark liquid Desorbate effluent coffee base extract were con densed in the trap. This liquid effluent coffee base extract showed a solids content of 20,6 as measured with a refractometer. H. Preparation of Coffee AFC The first liquid Desorbate effluent coffee basc extract containing 20.6 solids was adjusted to 30 solids content by adding dry Desorbate coffee base extract obtained from a previous run. The dry Desorbate base was dissolved directly into the first liquid base effluent at a tempera ture of not more than 10 C. Sufficient 30b solids coffee base extract conaining the first liquid effluent was poured into each of the three aroma flavor frost traps, each at which contained about 400 g of frost. A total of 400 g of Desorbate base was contained in each flask. Aliquots of first liquid effluent coffee base extract adjusted to 30 solids were poured into each frost trap while rotating the trap in a slanted position to coat the frost unifonnly with coffee solids. The liquid effluent froze during this process onto the frost. Then the flask was warmed up under a stream of water at 250C until sufficient melting of the 60t solids flask coating was achieved to slide the entire contents at once into a plastic bag which had been previously purged with nitrogen. The plastic bag was then closed loosely and the contents were kneaded until uniform plasticity was achieved. CO2 escaped during this operation. The plastic bags were then placed into a freezer box kept at 200C. After 30 minutes time the bags were removed for a second kneading. The bags were returned to the cold storage for another 30 minute period and then again kneaded. This process was repeated four times. The contents of the bags were then frozen solid at 60 C. The plastic, surrounding the solid frozen aroma flavor concentrate AFO , was then peeled away and the frozen AFC was crushed coarsely to fit into the feeder of a Buss Condux toothed disc mill. The crushed AFC was then milled on theBuss Condux mill which was housed in a cryogenic chamber at 700C. The milled particles were then sieved on a SWECO vibrating sieve system also housed in the same cryogenic chamber . The particles ranging from 850 microns to 2300 microns were collected Coarser particles were reground and resieved, etc.Particles finer than 850 microns were discarded 258 of total AFC . he desired sieved fraction of Arc was then immediately placed onto freeze dryig trays which had been cooled down with liquid nitrogen, the trays were then placed in a freeze dr er and the AFC was dried to a H20 content between 2 te 2.8t Approximately 5 of the AFC was freezedried with a dynamic freeze dryer Leybold Heraeus . The bulk of the AFC was freeze dried with static freeze dryers. Combining the AFC after freeze drying 900g of AFC was obtained from eachDesorbate run. Preliminary gustatory testing indicated that a range of 50 to 140 mg of AFC per 1 g of grain coffee base was suitable. The AFC comprised from about 10 wt. of cryogenically collected coffee aroma flavor compounds. The preferred AFC level was 7.58 of the coffee grain dry mix to yield a cup of coffee of considerably improved aroma flavor characteristics as compared to the base material without AFC. This mix was also found to be more acceptable as coffee to coffee drinkers as the leading instant coffees. E .MIPLE III As shown in Table I, collection of more Desorbate coffee hase extract was carried out after the collection of the first liquid Desorbate effluent. About 15.4 liters of coffee base extract was collected.Solids content of this base was 138. Application of steam wa .er spurts was stopped after a total run time of 90 minutes to avoid dilution of the Desorbate liquid coffee base extract. A total of 46 liters ofH20 had been applied to the column bed The draw off ratio at this point was 1 0.952 weight of roasted coffee beans vs. weight of column effluent . A yield of 13.71 solids had been obtained. Continuation of runs to a drawoff ratio of 1 2 or greater achieves solids yields of up to 27 solids. The Desorbate coffee base extract was poured into three plastic bags holding 5 liters each.The base was slowly frozen at 200C and then cooled down to GOOC. The frozen base was then milled and sieved in the same fashion as the AFC of ExampleII. The sieved base of the proper particle size was then freeze .ried. The dry Desorbate coffee base extract prepared in the manner as outlined above was used to prepare the AFC needed for the coffee grain product of this invention as set out in Example II. EXAMPLE IV A refined grain extract was made from pre roasted 4 day dark roast malted barley having a photovolt color reading of 68. Te roasted malted barley was prewet with tap water to a moisture level of about 15 . The barley was dechaffed with 30 pounds of blowing air in a rotary drum at 90 psig for 5 minutes. The yrinding was performed in a Gump grinder using a 13 and out setting. Sieve Analysis is.set out in Table II.

Prior to ref ining by flash evaporation, all feed material was filtered with 0.5 1.0 micron filters E39RlOS. Refining by thin film evaporation a equipment used rising and falling film evaporator at 1070C. b procedure the equipment was started up on water until the following conditions were established and then the barley grain extract was fed into a thin film evaporator and concentrated to a 45 solids grain extract. The thin film evaporated refined malted barley extract having a solids content of about 45 was spraydried. EXAMPLE V The barley spray dried refined grain extract powder of IBalrole IV and a commercially spray dried coffee Sse extract powder were mixed in a ribbon blender and then agglomerated. This powder blend comprised 49.0 said refined grain extract powder and 51 coffee base extract powder. The agglomerated product was run through the Rotex Siever on a No. 6 size screen. Final Product Blend. After the powders were TM ribbon blended, densified through an Alpine mill etld agglomerated, the final step of mixing theAFC of Example II into the material was done by riffling the products together. Two passes on one riffle tank was used. The final product blend pe centages were dried, refined grain extract 44.0 , instant coffee extract base, 48.52, and said AFC 7.500. This product provided a hot beverage which smelled and tasted like real coffee and was surprisingly as acceptC e to coffee drinkers as the leading instant coffee. EXALAPLE VI Another AFC was prepared from 10 kg of roasted and ground coffee beans following the general procedure set out in Example II. Four hundred grams of cryo genially collected Desorbate coffee aroma flavor frost were obtained by condensation in a cylindrical condensing vessel at 180 C and an absolute pressure of about 0.1 mm of mercury. One liter of a liquid coffee extract base concentrate with a 20 solids content at a temperature not higher than 50C was poured into the cylindrical vessel containing the aroma and flavor frost. As soon as some melting of the frost occurred, the frost, together with the liquid coffee extract base concentrate, was poured into a plastic bag which had been previously flushed with nitrogen gas. After the frost and coffee extract concentrate were added to the bag, the bag was sealed. The frost was now completely melted by gentle agitation and kneading. No headspace was permitted in the bag, thus preventing the vaporization of the highly volatile aroma materials. After complete melting of the frost and mixing, the bag was cooled in a freezing chamber at a temperature in the range of 4QC to 25 C until the mixture solidified several hours . At intervals of 30 to 45 minutes, the bag was removed from the chamber and agitated or kneaded to melt the small ice crystals. After the mixture solidifies, the bag with contents was immersed in liquid nitrogen. The bag was removed and the solids crushed and sieved to a particle size in the range of 500 to 1500 microns. The mixture was then freeze dried using a commercial vibrational freeze drying apparatus at temperatures of from 50 C to 100C. Coffee like instant coffee grain dry beverage mixes were prepared hy adding from 30 mg to 200 mg of this coffee AFC to 1 g of tIe dried, refined grain extract of Exarnplc I. A prepared mi was made which contained dro mg of this AFC per gram of the refined grain extract of Example I. This mix produced a beverage that was described by expert coffee tasters as virtually indistinguishable from a 100 coffee beverage. EXAMPLE VII Another AFC was prepared from roasted and ground coffee beans following the general procedure set out in Example II except that the flaked coffee was admixed with finely ground ice H20 in an amount sufficient to maintain a substantially melt free and uni . form admixture when loading into the Desorbate column. The use of finely ground ice allows water vapor to pass through the bed and the melting ice provides more uniform wetting for Inore uniform desorption. A preferred ratio of roast and grcu.d fee to ground ice on a weight basis is from about 2.5 1 to about 4 1.
