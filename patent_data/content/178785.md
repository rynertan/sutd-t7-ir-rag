# Nickel based alloy with high intergranular corrosion resistance, high stress corrosion cracking resistance and good hot workability.

## Abstract
An alloy prepared by reducing the sulfur content of ASTM UNS N06600 Trademark Inconel Alloy 600 to an extremely small value and adding specified amounts of Nb and N, and an alloy prepared by reducing the oxygen content of Inconel Alloy 600 and adding specified amounts of Nb, N, B and Mg show a mechanical strength equivalent or superior to that of Inconel Alloy 600 and excellent hot workability, and further has intergranular corrosion resistance and intergra nular stress corrosion cracking resistance which are far more excellent than those of Inconel Alloy 600.
