# Method and apparatus for fabricating a thermoelectric device.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for fabricating a thermoelect device includes forming a matrix board 12 with an array of orifices 100 formed therein. A plurality of P type thermoele ments 96 are formed and then a vacuum chuck 92 is utilized to dispose alternating ones of the elements 96 into the alternating ones of the orifices 100 . A plurality of N type elements 108 is formed and a vacuum chuck 104 is utilized to dispose alternating ones of the elements 108 into the remaining orifices 100 of the matrix 12 . This forms an assembled array 52 . A plurality of conductive tabs 114 is placed onto the P type elements 98 and N type elements 108 by a vacuum chuck 116 . A second set of conductive tabs 120 is disposed on the opposite side of the assembled array by a vacuum chuck 124 . A solder flow oven 54 and a solder flow oven 76 are utilized to reflow the solder on the tabs between the two operations. After connecting the tabs, the assembly 78 is moved to an epoxy station 80 to form an epoxy layer around the peripheral surfaces thereof to form a void 146 in the center portion thereof.
