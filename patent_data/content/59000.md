# A direct modulation FM demodulator.

## Abstract
A direct modulation FM demoduiator in which an incom ing FM signal 2a sin ω δω t is demodulated to baseband δω by applying it to first and second mixers 12, 14 . The out put b sin ωt of a local oscillator 16 is applied to one 14 of the mixers and is also applied to the other 12 of the mixers via a 90 phase shifter 18 . The phase of the output of one of the mixers is shifted so as to be in phase or in antiphase to the other and is applied together with the output of the other of the mixers to a divider 22 , the output of which comprises the baseband signal which is substantially independent of fading. The channel phase shifting may be done using a differen tiator 20 or an integrator.
