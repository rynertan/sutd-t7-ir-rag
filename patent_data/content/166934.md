# Removal of polyhalogenated biphenyls from organic liquids.

## Abstract
Polyhalogenated biphenyls such as PCB s, contained in transformer or capacitor oils, are removed from the transfor mer or capacitor oils by means of a combustible adsorbent which selectively adsorbs polyhalogenated biphenyls from transformer oils and the like. The adsorbent containing the adsorbed polyhalogenated biphenyls and the polyhalogen ated biphenyls adsorbed thereon are destroyed by combus tion in a molten salt.
