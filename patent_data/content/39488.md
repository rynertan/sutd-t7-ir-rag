## Description
SPECIFICATION 3ACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improved poly alkylene oxide compositions, and more particularly to polytalkylene axide compositions and aqueous solutions thereof that exhibit excellent resistance to oxidation and that inhibit corrosion of ferrous metals with which they come in contact. Poly alkylene oxide polymers have many and diverse industrial applications, providing not only compatibility with water, but good lubricating qualities and stability as well. Thus, these materials have found wide use both as substantially 100 percent active compositions and as aqueous solutions in applications such as hydraulic fluids, metal working lubricants, metal treating formulations, and the like. As with all materials that may contain some water, these must protect metals with which they come in contact, and ferrous metals are of particular interest.Corrosion inhibitive additives are therefore commonly included in the poly alkylene oxide containing compositions for this purpose, and success or failure in a particular application may well depend upon the quality of protection for metals realized in service. A potential hindrance to the protection accorded is that, like most organic polymers, polytalkylene oxides are oxidized by oxygen at elevated temperatures. Even in an aqueous medium, oxidation of the polymer can have a significant effect on the lubricating quality of the fluid. Moreover, the products of oxidation are usually acids that foster corrosion of most metals,and further limit the useful life of the polymer containing compositions. Heretofore1 alkali metal nitrites such as sodium nitrite have been widely used as additives for polytalkylene oxide solutions to inhibit corrosion of metals their powerful passivating effect on ferrous metals being well knows Recently, however, the carcinogenic properties of N nitrosamines, which are the reaction products of secondary amines with nitrites, have caused serious concern about the advisability of using nitrites, and the replacement of nitrites with additives that do not present a health hazard, yet are effective in corrosion inhibition, is of considerable interest. However, it has been found that nitrite ions are very efficient in preventing the oxidation of higher polytalkylene oxide polymers in hot aqueous solutions, in addition to inhibiting corrosion, and, therefore, a suitable replacement for the alkali metal nitrites in poly alkylene oxide containing compositions must impart resistance to oxidation as well as protection against corrosion. while there are many additives known in the art which inhibit the corrosion of metals or improve the oxidation resistance of organic polymers, none of these materials has been shown to achieve both effects in an aqueous polymer solution. In copending application 053,536 of B. Mago, filed June 29, 1979, there are disclosed poly alkylene oxide compositions containing small amounts of a b i ed di er of a hydroxyl substituted aromatic carboxylic acid, and in copending application 079,202 of 3. Mago, filed September 26 r 1979, there are disclosed pcly al ylene oxide compositions containing small amounts of a mononuclear aromatic compound having at least one substituent nitro group, both of which compositions exhibit excellent resistance to oxidative degradation and inhibit the corrosion of ferrous metals.The effective concentration of the inhibitor additives disclosed is, however, somewhat greater than that of the alkali metal nitrites, and it would be desirable to provide suitable protection with a lesser amount of additive or even further improvements in corrosion inhibition may be desirable for certain applications. SUMMARY OF TXE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there are provided poly alkylene oxide compositions which exhibit resistance to oxidative degradation and inhibit the corrosion of ferrous metals, having incorporated therein a small effective inhibiting amount of a mixture comprising a mononuclar aromatic compound having at least one substituent nitro group and a precipitant anodic inhibitor. Preferably, said compositions comprise a buffer having a pE between about 8 and 10. There are also provided in accordance with the present invention aqueous poly alkylene oxide compositions comprising a small effective inhibiting amount of a mixture comprising a mononuclear aromatic compound having at least one substituted nitro group and a precipitant anodic inhibitor. Preferably, a buffer having a pa between about 8 and 10 is also included in said compositions. Also provided is a method for preparing poly alkylene oxide compositions which exhibit resistance to cxidative degradation and inhibit the corrosion of ferrous metals which comprises ineorporating in a polytalkylene oxide composition a mononuclear aromatic compound having at least one substituent nitro group and a precipitant anodic inhibitor. Zt has been found that the particular combinations of additive components herein disclosed is efficient in inhibiting the oxidation of poly alkylene oxide polymer compositions, including aqueous solutions thereof, and is significantly more effective in inhibiting the corrosion of ferrous metals contacted by such compositions than either of said components are when used alone, while not presenting any known health hazards or toxicological problems. DESCRfPTION OF TEE INVENTION Poly alkylene oxide polymers suitable for use in the compositions of the invention are known compounds, and even though of high molecular weight, are water soluble. In general, these polymers will contain oxyethylene groups or both oxyethylene groups and higher oxyalkylene groups such as oxybutylene and oxypropylene groups in their molecules, and will have average molecular weights from 400 to 40,000.The proportion of oxyethylene groups in the molecule is such that the poly alkylene oxide polymers are soluble in water at ordinary temperatures, and the proportion of oxypropylene or higher oxyalkylene group is such that the poly alkylene oxide remains liquid at ordinary temperatures up to a molecular weight of 40,000 and higher, or melts at temperatures below about ó0eC. The oxypropylene oxyethylene molar ratio may vary from zero to about unity.These poly alkylene oxide polymers may be.made by processes well known in the art by reacting ethylene oxide or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide or higher alkylene oxide with a compound having from one up to as many as six active hydrogen atoms, such as water, monchydroxylic alcohols such as ethanoL and propanol, dihydroxylic alcohols such as ethylene glycol, trihydroxylic alcohols such as glycerine and trimethylolpropane, tetrahydroxylic alcohols such as pentaerythritol, hexahydroxylic alcohols such as sorbitol, and mono or poly functional amines such as butylamine and ethylene dizmine. The poly alkylene oxide products of such reactions will have linear or branched oxyethylene or oxyethylene higher oxyalkylene chains, and such chains will terminate with hydroxyl groups. Some or all of these hydroxyl groups may be etherified by reaction with a dialkyl sulfate such as diethyl sulfate. As hereinabove stated, the poly alkylene oxide compositions af the invention can be used in their substantially 100 percent active form or as aqueous solutions thereof. The proportion of poly alkylene oxide polymers in such aqueous solutions depends upon the particular application for which they are intended and can be varied within a wide range to obtain the desired results. In general, the aqueous solution contains any amount of pòlymer from about 0.1 percent by weight to about 56 percent by weight. An essential component of the compositions of the Invention is a mononuclear aromatic compound having at least one substituent nitro group. Suitable nitroaromatic compounds are the nitro substituted aromatic acids and compounds such as nitroaromatic saltsr esters, and the like, that, in situ, effect the formation of the acid anion. Exemplary suitable njtroaromatic compounds are 3 nitrobenzoic acid, 4 nitrochthalic acid, 4 nitroisophthalic acid, 3,5 dinitrobenzoic acid, p nitrocinnamic acid, and the like, and alkali metal or omonium salts thereof. Another essential component of the compositions of the invention is a precipitant anodic inhibitor. Suitable precipitant anodic inhibitors include the anion of a fatty acid, which may be saturated or unsaturated, having up to 24 or more carbon atoms. Zllustrative of such fatty acids are hexanoic, octanoic, capric, decanoic, lauric, myristic, palmitic, nonanoic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and the like acids which may have either straight or branched carbon chains. Products in which mixtures of acids of the foregoing kind occur, such as tall oil acid, may also be used. Also suitable are bridged dimers of a hydroxyl substituted aromatic carboxylic acid and salts thereof of the general formula EMI7.1 wherein X is a chemically stable group selected from lower alkylene, sulfonyl, and amino groups, and a sulfur atom, and Y and Y may be the same or different and are a hydrogen atom, hydroxyl group, amino group, or alkyl group. Also suitable are non oxidizing inorganic acids such as tungstic, molybdic, and phosphoric acids. Other suitable precipitant anodic inhibitors are boric acid and benzoic acid. As a general rule, the additive components hereinabove described are used in a combined amount sufficient to impart the desired degree of corrosion inhibition and oxidation resistance to the composition, depending upon the severity of operating conditions and service requirements for the particular application.The amount used may vary somewhat depending on such factors and can be readily determined by routine etperimentationo The maximum amount of each of the additive components and the combinations thereof that should be present is not critical, with economic factors generally determining the use of amounts greatly in excess of that actually required.The combined amount of additive components that should be present will be called herein an effective amount , which is defined as being above the minimum required to achieve the oxidation resistance and corrosion protection required for a particular application, In general, however, an amount of each of the additive components of about 5 to 16 millimoles of compound per liter of polymer solution, or even less, will be a minimum effective amount of the combination of additives. In accordance with the present invention, preferred embodiments of the compositions of the invention may also have incorporated therein a class of buffets having a pR between about 8 and 10. Exemplary suitable buffers are amine buffers such as alkanolamines and borax. Poly alkylene oxide compositions and aqueous solutions thereof which exhibit resistance to oxidative degradation and inhibit the corrosion of ferrous metals, ..such as th poly alkylene oxide compositions of the invention, may be prepared by incorporating the additive components herein described in a polyfalkylene oxide polymer by admixing said additive components with the poly alkylene oxide using any known method until a solution or uniform dispersion thereof is formed. Preferably, the additive components employed will be soluble in the poly al cylene oxide and in aqueous solutions thereof. The order of addition of said additive components is not critical. Studies of corrosion inhibition of aqueous solutions of poly alkylene oxide of this invention, as well as the controls which demonstrate the prior art, involved izzersion tests of panels of steel for eight days in a 10 polymer solution at 700C while sparging lightly with air, and then measuring weight loss and noting the appearance of the metal and of the solutions.The corrosion inhibiting ability of the various polymer solutions was determined for solutions prepared with distilled water to which, typically, 500 ppm each of sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium formate were added to simulate typical impurities The samples used in this study were weighed, cold rolled 4 inch x 4 inch x 1 16 inch mild steel plates which had been polished and scrubbed with a wet bristle brush and commercial kitchen powder cleaner, rinsed, and dried. The degree of corrosion was determined from the weight change of the steel panel sample after cleaning, with weight loss being recorded in units of mils per year mpy . The invention will become more clear when considered together with the following examples, which are set forth as being merely illustrative of the invention and which are not intended, in any manner, to be limitative thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. XA PL 1 The apparatus and procedures outlined above were used to evaluate the corrosion inhibition of steel for lot aqueous solutions of various poly alkylene oxide compositions. In the immersion corrosion tests, the polyfalkylene oxide polymer used was a liquid, water soluble commercial product available under the trademark designation UCON 75 E 90000 from Union CarbideCorporation. In these tests, compositions containing the sodium salt of m nitrobenzoic acid in various proportions by itself and in combination with benzoic acid a precipitant anodic inhibitor and monoethanolamine a buffer were compared with compositions prepared without any inhibitor and with compositions containing the sodium salt of benzoic acid or monoethanolamine by itself and in combination thereof. The results obtained during the corrosion tests are summarized in Table I. The data thus presented show that when no inhibitor was used in the aqueous poly alkylene oxide composition Tests 1, 2, and 3 , the weight loss of the steel test panels was very high, whereas the corrosion rate was insignificant with an aqueous poly al yIene oxide composition containing a combination of the sodium salt of m nitrobenzoic acid, monoethanolamine, and ben oic acid Test 9 .Tests 4 and 5, however, show that m nitroben oate ion, when used alone, had a critical concentration between 36 mmol liter Test 4 and 72 mmol iiter Test 5 , below which it was ineffective and above which the corrosion rate was essentially not measurable less than 0.1 mil year , which critical concentration was much higher than was used effectively in Test 9. Moreover, in Test 6, it was shown that the benzoate ion at high concentration and pE only partly inhibits the corrosion rate, and in Tests 7 and 8, monethanolamine by itself and in combination with benzoic acid only partially reduces the corrosion rate.

The type and proportions of additives employed in the compositions of this Example and the corrosion inhibition results are summarized inTable It. The poly alkylene oxide was the same polymer employed in the compositions of Example 1. The data thus presented show in Tests 1 3 the high weight loss of steel test panels resulting from aqueous poly alkylene oxide compositions where no inhibitor was used, and in Tests 4 and S that the corrosion rate was reduced to a negligible value by the a nitrobenzoate ion alone when it is used at a concentration above a critical value in the range 36 to 72 o1 liter. Tests 6 and 7 show that the pentasodium salt of diethylenetriaminepenta methylene phosphonic acid , a buffer available commercially under the trademark designation Wayplex 5 FS from Philip A.EuntCorp., used in combination with the sodium salt of m nitrobenzoic acid resulted in a corrosion rate so high, as determined by visual observation, that the tests were terminated after one day without determining the weight losses. Further, Tests 8 and 9 show that disodium pamoate alone was a partial corrosion inhibitor, although the combination thereof with the buffer Wayplex 5 FA Tests 10 and 11 , appears to promote corrosion. In Tests 11 and. 13, it was shown that the combination of disodium pamoate and sodium m nitrobenzoate, used at concentrations at which neither material was effective in inhibiting corrosion by itself, together reduced the rate of corrosion to a negligible value, even when employed in combination with Wayplet 55 FA.

The poly al ylene oxide was the same polymer employed in the compositions of Example 1, and the Wayplex 55 FA was the same buffer used in Example 2. In these tests, compositions containing the nitrobenzoate additive were compared with compositions prepared without any inhibitor and with compositions containing the other additives by themselves or in combination. The compositions employed and results obtained are summarized in Table IIT. The data presented in Tests 1 to 7 are the same as Tests 1 to 7 in Example 2 and show the high weight loss of steel test panels resulting from aqueous polyEalkylene oxide compositions where no corrosion inhibitor was used Test 1 to 3 , that m nitrobenzoate by itself was an effective corrosion inhibitor when used at a concentration above a critical value in the range 36 to 72 mmol liter Tests 4 and 5 , and that the combination of the buffer, Wayplex 55 PA, and m nitrobenzoate resulted in an extremely high corrosion rate Tests 6 and 7 . In tests 8 and 9 hereof, the data presented show that compositions containing the combination of the disodium salt of methylene disalicylic acid and Wayplex SS FS exhibited a very high corrosion rate, and the tests were terminated without measuring the weight losses.Tests 10 and 11, however, show that compositions containing the combination of the disodium salt of methylenedisalicyclic acid and the sodium salt of m nitrobenzoic acid, at concsnttations at which neither additive was an effective corrosion inhibitor alone, exhibited essentially negligible corrosion.

The poly alkylene oxide polymer ofExample 1 was used in the compositions of this example. In these tests, buffered poly alkylene oxide compositions containing no additional additive were compared with compositions in which other additives and combinations of additives were used, and the results obtained during the corrosion tests are summarized inTable rv. The data thus presented show that poly alkylene oxide compositions containing a partially neutralized monoethanolamine buffer Tests 1 3 exhibit a high corrosion rate of steel panels, and Tests 4 and 5 show that 3,5 dinitrobenzoate in the buffered poly alkylene oxide compositions up to a concentration of at least 10 mmol liter was ineffective in inhibiting corrosion. ZnTests 6 and 8, it is shown that methylenedisalicylic acid and pamoic acid were partial inhibitors for corrosion by the buffered poly alkylene oxide compositions, but the combination of 3,5 dinitrobenzoic acid with methylenedisalicylic acid Test 7 or with pamoic acid Test 9 inhibits corrosion by the buffered polytalkylene oxide solutions better than does any component alone.

In these tests, compositions containing 3,5 dinitrobenzoic acid by itself and in combination with various inorganic acid salts were compared with compositions prepared without any inhibitor. The compositions employed and results obtained during the corrosion tests are summarized inTable V. The data show that in Tests 1 to 5, the buffered poly alkylene oxide composition without other additives was quite corrosive, and that 3,5 dinitroben oic acid in concentrations up to at least 10 mmol liter did not achieve any inhibition of the corrosion by the poly alkylene oxide composition.Tests 6 and 8 show that sodium tungstate and sodium molybdate partially inhibit the corrosion of buffered poly alkylene oxide compositions, while Tests 7 and 9 show that combinations of 3,5 dintrobenzoic acid with sodium tungstate or sodium molybdate effect better corrosion inhibition than either additive alone at the concentrations employed.
