## Description
This invention relates to chioropyridyl antifungal agents and in particular to certain l 5 chloropyrid 2 yl l 2,4 dihalo phenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol L yl ethanol compounds which are particularly effective as oral and topical agents in the treatment of fungal diseases in humans and other animals, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. European Patent Application no. 0046337 discloses a broad class of triazole compounds having the general formula EMI1.1 formula I or stereoisomers thereof, wherein R1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl or optionally substituted phenyl R2 is a heterocyclic group and Az is a 1,2,4 triazolyl radical and acid addition salts, ethers, esters and metal complexes thereof. Az represents a 1,2,4triazol l yl radical or a 1,2,4 triazol 4 yl radical. These compounds are stated.to possess fungicidal activity, principally as plant fungicides, and also to be plant growth regulators. They are also stated to possess antifungal properties which are useful in the treatment of candidiasis and human dermatophyte infections. It has now been found that two specific unexemplified compounds within this broad class have a degree of in vivo antifungal activity far greater than the compounds illustrated in theExamples of European Patent Application no. 0046337, and this surprising degree of activity makes the compounds of particular value in the systemic treatment of human fungal infections. To reach these compounds it is necessary to select specific values for R1 and R2 from the wide range of values specified, and in particular it is necessary to select for R2 a 5 chloropyrid 2 yl group, a particular substituent group which is not disclosed in the European Patent Application referred to. The chloropyridyl compounds of the present invention have the formula 11 .EMI2.1 where Ar is 2,4 dichlorophenyl or 2,4 difluorophenyl, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compound wherein Ar is 2,4 difluorophenyl is preferred. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions, especially compositions for oral administration, comprising a compound of the formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The compounds of formula II can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme wherein Ar is as previously defined EMI3.1 The rection is simply performed by first reacting 2 bromo 5 chloropyridine with n butyl lithium in an inert organic solvent, e.g. diethylether, at a low temperature, e.g. 78cm, and then adding the appropriate 2 chloro 2 ,4 dihaloacetophenone III . The intermediate IV is generally not isolated in pure form but is reacted directly with triazole and anhydrous potassium carbonate in dimethylformamide. The reaction is assisted by warming e.g. at 800C, and after several hours the desired product may be isolated in a conventional manner and further purified, if desired, by crystallisation or by chromatography. The compour.ds of the invention contain a chiral centre, and the invention includes both resolved and unresolved forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula II include those formed from strong acids which form non toxic acid addition salts, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, oxalic and methanesulphonic acids. The salts may be obtained by conventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing equimolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent. The compounds of the formula II and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are anti fungal agents, useful in combating fungal infections in animals, including humans. For example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in man caused by, among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused byCandida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis . They may also be used systemically in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by for example, Candida albicans, Crpptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Uistoplasma or Blastomyces. The in vitro evaluation of the anti fungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minium inhibitory concentration m.i.c of the test compounds in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular micro organism fails to occur.In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration are inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 370C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate m.i.c. value is noted. Other micro organisms used in such tests can include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton spp Microsporum spp Epidermophyton floccosum, Coccidioides immitis, and Torulopsis glabrata. The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice which are inoculated with a strain of Candida albicans. Activity is based on the survival of a treated group of mice after the death of an untreated group of mice following 48 hours observation. The dose level at which the compound provides 50 protection against the lethal effect of the infection is noted. Results obtained for the compounds of formula 11 in such tests show that they are much more effective as oral antifungal agents than the compounds disclosed in the Examples of EuropeanPatent Application no. 0046337, as can be seen from the following tabIe which gives comparative results for several of the compounds of European Patent Application No. 0046337, together with the results for Examples 1 and 2 of the present application when tested orally in mice infected with Candida albicans.

For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of a syrup or suspension containing flavouring or colouring agents. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneQusly. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, it is expected that the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the invention will be from 0.1 to 10 mg kg in divided doses when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus. tablets or capsules of the compounds can be expected to contain from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. Inany event the physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable. for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention. Alternatively, the anti fungal compounds of formula II may be administered in the forz of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they may be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they may be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10Z, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required. The following Examples illustrate preparation of the compounds of the invention.
