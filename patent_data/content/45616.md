# Fitments for injection devices.

## Abstract
In order to minimise the risk of infection when a large number of animals are injected with the same needle 3, the injecting gun 1 is provided with a stainless steel sleeve 9 which surrounds the needle 3. The sleeve 9 comprises a first tube 10 attached to the needle connecting body 2 and a second tube 11 telescopically slidable within the first tube 10 against a spring 22. A detachable plastics cap 12 incorporat ing a sterilizing substance and having a layer of felt 18 projecting therefrom is fitted on the free end of the second tube 11. In use of the gun 1 to inject an animal, the layer of felt 18 projecting from the cap 12 is brought into contact with the proposed site of injection and pressure is applied to the gun 1 to apply sterilizing substance to the animal s skin, and to cause the tubes 10, 11 to telescope, so that the point of the needle 3 passes through the sterilizing substance and punctures the skin of the animal. On releasing the applied pressure, the point of the needle 3 will be withdrawn from the animal and will pass back through the sterilizing substance under the action of the spring 22. A similar fitting may be used for marking an animal during injection, and such a fitting is applicable to a high pressure hypodermic gun.
