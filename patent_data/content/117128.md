# MULTIPLEXED ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTER

## Abstract
A multiplexed analog to digital converter for video and sound signals is provided. Apparatus employing the inven tion comprises sources of analog video signals 10,12,14,16 and sound signals 10,22,24,26,28,30 , an analog to digital converter 34 , and digital video and sound signal processors 50,54 . The analog video signals include successive horizon tal line intervals. Coupling means 18,20,36,40 couple the analog to digital converter between the analog video signal source and the digital video signal processor during first predetermined portions of the horizontal line intervals and between the analog sound signal source and the digital sound signal processor during second predetermined por tions of the horizontal line intervals which are different from the first predetermined portions.
