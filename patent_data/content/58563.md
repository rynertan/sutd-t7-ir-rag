# Lyophilized phosphorylated nucleosides.

## Abstract
Phosphorylated nucleotides for addition to nucleotide chains in the stepwise synthesis of oligonucleotides, e.g. on a polymeric support, are prepared in dioxane solvent and then lyophilized, to provide a stable, dry product ready for re dissolving in reaction solvent. The lyophilized products are stable indefinitely and do not suffer from decreased reactivity.
