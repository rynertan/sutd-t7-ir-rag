# Vacuum limiting arrangement.

## Abstract
A vacuum limiting arrangement uses a three port, two position valve 10 in conjunction with a vacuum sustain valve 26 to limit the vacuum applied to a vacuum driven device 22. A source of vacuum is connected to one of the ports 16. The device 22 is connected to the port 14 and the third port is vented. The device can thus be connected either to the vacuum source in one position of the valve 10 or to vent. A control port 12 which is effective to switch the valve 10, is connected into a vacuum line between the valve 10 and the device 22. The sustain valve 26 allows free flow of air from the device 22 to the valve 10, but only allows a restricted flow in the opposite direction.
