## Description
RECIRCULATING DOCUMENT HANDLER AND METHOD The present invention relates to a recirculating document handler and method for recirculating original document sheets from a stack thereof to an imaging station of a copier for copying with selected document recirculation loop paths depending on the copying mode selected, and in particular for providing such a document handling system with both immediate duplex and common side duplex precollation copying modes of operation. Especially for the faster xerographic and other document copiers now in commercial use, it is increasingly desirable to provide for the automatic handling of the individual original document sheets being copied, in order to more fully utilize the higher copying speed capabilities of these copiers. It is particularly desirable to rapidly automatically feed, register and copy document sheets of a variety or mixture of sizes, types, weights, materials, conditions and susceptibility to damage, yet with minimal document jamming, wear or damage by the document handling apparatus. Yet it is also desirable that the document handling units be as compact, simple and lightweight as possible.This is especially desirable where, as conventionally practiced, the entire document handling unit is pivotally mounted over the existing copier platen to be liftable by the operator to facilitate alternative manual document placements on the platen. A known desirable feature for an automatic document handling system for a copier is to provide document recirculations for precollation copying. Such precollation copying systems provide a number of important advantages. The copies exit the copier into a set collector already in precollated sets, and do not require subsequent sorting in a sorter or collator.On line finishing and or removal of completed copy sets may be provided while additional copy sets are being made from the same document set. Also, a complete copy proof set is available from the first document set circulation.Any desired number of such copy sets may be made by making a corresponding number of recirculations of the document set in collated order past a copying station and copying each document once each time it recirculates. Examples of such systems are further described in the patent literature cited hereinbelow. However, a disadvantage of precollation copying systems is that the documents must all be repeatedly recirculated and repeatedly individually copied a number of times equivalent to the desired number of copy sets. For example, to make 10 copy sets of a 5 page document set or book, one copy at a time can be made of each of the 5 document pages in this order pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or the reverse page order repeated a total of 10 times to make the desired 10 copy sets. Thus, increased document recirculations are necessitated for a precollation copying system, with consequent increased likelihood of document jams and document wear, image smearing, or damage, particularly if the document feeding paths are lengthy, interrupted, or excessively arcuate. The type of document transport and registration system is affected by the type of copier optics, i.e., the copying system. In the known constant velocity transport CVT system a moving document is copied with a stationary optics system. The document sheet is fed by wheels or belts at a constant velocity over a narrow transparent scanning slit, window or platen of a copier.This is desirable for a small copier since the overall system can be much more compact. However, such a CVT system can also be combined into a copier also providing a full size stationary platen by using a part of the full platen to provide the CVT scanning slit. This has been used to provide for alternativeCVT document stream feeding , or for feeding documents which are larger than the platen, e.g., the Xerox 3100 LDC copier e.g., U.S. Patents Nos.3,900,258 and 4,017,172 It is generally preferable in such a CVI system to preregister the document to its transport just before the document is transported over the copying window. Examples are disclosed in the above patents or in U.S.Patent 3,536,320 issued October 27, 1970 to D.R. Derby. In contrast, in many other copying systems or modes, the document is registered overlying a full document sized full frame platen, and either optically scanned by moving scanning optics while it is held stationary over the platen or optically stopped by flash illumination and imaging of the entire document when the document is driven by the document transport to the registration position over the platen. Examples are disclosed in patents cited below. Of particular interest as disclosing a recirculating document handler for a copier with a stack at one side of an imaging station and means for returning the document through alternative paths to the stack inverted or not inverted for duplex or simplex precollation copying, are U.S. Patents 4,238,126 issued December 9, 1980 to M.J. Langdon 4,234,180 issuedNovember 18, 1980 to J.H. Looney and 4,229,101 issued October 21, 1980 toT.J. Hamlin et al the latter also disclosing CVT imaging, and plural circulation of a single document in col. 11, lines 46 52. Other duplex or simplex recirculating document handlers are disclosed, for example, in U.S. PatentNos. 4,278,344 issued July 14, 1981 to R.B. Sahay 4,269,406 issued May 26, 1980 to T.J. Hamlin 4,176,945 issued December 4, 1979 to R.C. Holzhauser, et al 4,158,500 issued June 19, 1979 to A.B.DiFrancesco et al and 4,140,387 issued February 20, 1979 to G.B. Gustafson et al and 4,089,515 issued May 16, 1978 and 4,109,903 issued August 29, 1978, both to Klaus K. Stange, et al. A simplex document recirculating handler and diagnostics therefor is disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,206,995 issued June 10, 1980 to E.L. Legg. Examples of non recirculating single duplex moving document copiers with reversing document movement are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,066,252 issued January 3, 1978 to R. Wick and Japanese Application No. 47 49718 filed May 19, 1972 and laid open February 9, 1974 as No. 49 15435. A curved chute duplex document inverter is detailed in U.S. Patent No. 4,262,895 issued April 21, 1981 to S.J. Wenthe, Jr. Cross reference is also made to copending U.S.applications Serial Nos. 314633 and 314801, filed October 23 and 26, 1981 respectively, and corresponding to European Patent Application No. filedOctober 23 1982 D 79299K . The art also includes various other patents teaching document handlers and also control systems therefor, such as U.S. Patent Nos. 4,062,061 4,076,408 4,078,787 4,099,860 4,125,325 4,132,401 4,144,550 4,158,500 4,176,945 4,179,215 4,229,101 4,278,344 and 4,284,270. Conventional simple software instructions in the copier s general microprocessor logic circuitry and software of document handler and copier control functions and logic, as taught by the above and other patents and various commercial copiers, are well known and preferred. However, it will be appreciated that the document feeding functions and controls described herein may be alternatively conventionally incorporated into a copier utilizing any other suitable or known simple software or hard wired logic systems, cam bank switch controllers, etc. With the present system, both document feeding and copying thereof can be initiated simply by a known document lead edge detector switch actuated as the document sheet is being inserted. See, e.g., the above cited U.S.Patent No. 4,132,401 issued January 2, 1979 toJ.F. Gauranski et al and the references cited therein. The present invention overcomes or reduces various of the abovediscussed problems. A preferred feature of the invention disclosed herein is to provide, in a recirculating document handler for plurally recirculating duplex original document sheets to and from a stack thereof and to and from the imaging station of a copier for providing duplex document precollation copying, the improvement comprising a plural mode document recirculation loop path means providing selected ones of different document recirculation looped paths, depending on the copying mode selected, and movable path selector means in said pluralmode document recirculation loop path means for, in one selected mode, returning a document sheet in a selected said loop path directly but inverted to said copying station for copying the opposite side thereof after copying one side thereof and before returning the document sheet to said stack, and alternatively, in another mode selected by movement of said selector means, returning a document sheet to said stack inverted after copying one side thereof, so that said recirculating document handler provides, selectably, both an immediate duplex document precollation copying mode and a common side duplex document precollation copying mode, respectively. Further features which may be provided by the recirculating document handler disclosed herein include those in which said document recirculating loop path means provides a completed single inversion document recirculation loop path from and back to and over said imaging station in said immediate duplex copying mode, and provides a single inversion path from said imaging station back to said stack in said common side duplex precollation copying mode, or in both said duplex document precollation copying modes the duplex document sheets are fed separately from the bottom of the stack of sheets in a stack support adjacent the side of said imaging station, fed by the same constant velocity transport means over a narrow scanning slit at said imaging station without inversion and thereafter in said immediate duplex copying mode the duplex documents are then inverted once in a first inversion path and refed to said imaging station for copying the opposite side of the same sheet, and then fed back to the top of the stack of sheets in said stack support with one additional inversion in a second inversion path so that the sheet returns to the same stack in its same, original, orientation in said stack and may be refed to recopy both sides of the same sheet in the same page sequence and wherein in said common side duplex document copying mode the duplex document sheets are returned from the same imaging station inverted once through a return inversion path to the top of the stack in said stack support, so that the document sheets are inverted from their previous orientation in the stack and may be refed to the imaging station to recopy the opposite sides of the sheets in a different page sequence, or the return path for a document sheet from said imaging station back to the top of the stack including said return inversion path in said common side duplex copying mode is the same as that for a document sheet in said immediate duplex copying mode after the second side has been copied, including said second inversion path, or in a recirculating document handling method for plurally recirculating original document sheets to and from stack thereof and to and from the imaging station of a copier in a selected one of at least two different document recirculation looped paths, depending on the copying mode selected, for providing precollation copying, in a single document recirculating apparatus, the improvement for duplex document precollation copying comprising the steps of feeding duplex document sheets seriatim from the stack to the imaging station and in one selected mode returning a document sheet on a selected loop path directly, but inverted once, to said copying station after copying one side thereof and before returning the document sheet to the stack and then returning the document sheet to the stack in its original orientation in the stack and in an alternative selectable mode returning a document sheet to said stack inverted once after copying one side thereof so that the document sheets are inverted from their previous orientation in the stack and may be refed to the imaging station to recopy the opposite sides of the sheets in a different sequence to provide, selectably, an immediate duplex document copying mode and a common side duplex precollation copying mode with the same recirculating document apparatus, or in said immediate duplex copying mode duplex each document sheet is fed separately from the bottom of the stack of sheets from adjacent the side of said imaging station, then fed with a constant velocity through a narrow scanning slit at said imaging station without inversion, then reversed and inverted through a first single inversion path and refed through said scanning slit for copying the opposite side of the same sheet, and then fed back to the top of the stack of sheets with one additional inversion through a different inversion path so that the sheet returns to the same stack in its same, original, orientation in said stack and may be refed to recopy both sides of the same sheet in the same sequence on the next recirculation of the document stack. In order that the invention may be better understood reference will now be made to the following description of a specific example thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional side view of an exemplary document handling apparatus in accordance with the present invention on an exemplary copier partially shown and Fig. 2A 2D schematically show the document paths for four different modes of operation of the document handling unit of Fig. 1. Referring to the embodiment of Fig. 1 and 2, an exemplary constant velocity transport CVT document handling unit 10 is mounted on an exemplary copier 11. The unit 10 feeds individual original document sheets 12 seriatim from the bottom on a stack 13 in a constant velocity movement path over the transparent copying window or platen 14 of the copier 11. The unit 10 also transports documents from the platen 14 back to the top of the stack 13. The stack 13 is in a stack holder or tray 16 adjacent one side of the platen 14. The documents are loaded face down and generally fed in 1 N or forward serial page order in a short and substantially linear path directly from the bottom of the stack 13 to the platen 14. Since the copier 11 may be any of various known types such as those in the patents cited above, its example here is disclosed only to the extent of the document handler 10 optical interface therewith. Here each document sheet 12 is preferably conventionally exposed on the platen 14 by an illumination lamp 17 or lamps and a light reflector therefor under the platen.The flowing slit image of that portion of the document thus uniformly illuminated which is within an imaging or viewing area 18 in a central portion of platen 14 is conventionally focused onto the copier photoreceptor 19 through a stationary lens 20. Here the lens 20 is a self focusing linear optical fiber array as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,977,777. This flowing light image on the photoreceptor 19 may then be conventionally developed and transferred to a registered copy sheet, as further described in the above cited references. As discussed above, the lamp 17 and lens 20 may be permanently fixed, or may be only temporarily locked in this position and otherwise movable to scan a full size platen contiguous or adjacent the imaging area 18. Here a portion one edge of such an adjacent full platen 21 is shown. The side of the document parallel the direction of document motion may be initially registered against, and guided along, an edge guide 22 in the stack holder 16. The initial registration of the lead edge of document to the other orthogonal axis, an imaginary line transverse the direction of document motion, can be done in several ways. Here it is conventionally accomplished simply by aligning abutting the lead edge of the document sheet with sheet feed rollers, that is, against a plural roller transverse nip line.As discussed above, a document sheet lead edge detector switch may be activated as this is done to initiate the operation of both the document handler 10 and copier 11 in a known manner. This initial separation and feed in of each document sheet 12 from the stack 13 may be done by a corrugating vacuum belt bottom feeder 24 assisted by an air knife system 26, shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,284,270 issuedAugust 18, 1981 to M. Silverberg, for example. The transport 10 provides a CVT with no changes in driving velocity while the document is being driven over the optical scan slit 18. Here the constant velocity line nip from aligned rubber rolls 28 and mating idler rollers thereunder catches and drives the lead edge of the document upstream of before the document enters the scan slit 18. This nip drives the document over the scan slit 18. On the other side of the imaging area 18 is a similar set of equal speed rollers 30 which continue the document sheet movement until it is all imaged. Switch 32, connected to the copier microprocessor controller 36, is activated by the document lead edge slightly before the document enters the imaging area 18. That, and or paper path switches, including conventional set counter bail and stack sensor switches 34, may be used to initiate the operation of the copier as well as counting the number of documents copied.Switch 32 may also be used to sense the emminent passage of the trail edge of the document through the imaging station for other controls, including the timing of document reversal in certain operating modes as described below. Considering now the overall configuration of the document handling unit 10, it may be seen that other than the separable stack tray 16 and input feeder assembly 24,26, the unit 10 comprises a very compact and short path racetrack or flattened oval looped path baffle and feeder unit. A complete or closed loop racetrack path 38 is provided enabling continuous recirculation of a sheet in one direction from and back to the imaging slit 18.It provides a total racetrack path length preferably less than twice the document sheet dimension in its feeding direction. The racetrack path 38 includes two 1800 semi cylindrical sheet inverting loop paths 42 and 44 at opposite ends of the racetrack. In addition to this outside or racetrack path 38 there is provided here a diagonal cross path 40, internally bisecting and connecting with the outer racetrack path 38. The cross path 40 connects between the bottom entrance of loop path 42 and the top entrance of loop path 44. Further an output restack path 46 from path 38 connects at the opposite side of the top of path 44 with path 40.The path 42 here provides an integral inverter return loop path in which the same, common, path 42 provides in certain copying modes a compact, curved, sheet reversing and non inverting temporary storage chute for sheets fed in and out of one end thereof and in other copying modes the same path 42 provides a non reversing and inverting document path therethrough. All of these paths are short and interconnecting for rapid document circulation without requiring high velocity document movements. Further, all document sheet movements are gentle transitions, i.e., there are no undesirable sharply arcuate small radius turns or inversions in any of these document paths, even though the overall size of the unit is quite small. The above described paths and their associated feed rollers provide a recirculating document handler 10 for recirculating document sheets to and from the stack 12 thereof to and from the imaging station 18 of the copier Il with a selection of document recirculation loop paths to provide a plurality of modes of operation, i.e., plural document circulation modes, as illustrated inFigs. ZA 2D. That is, different ones of interconnecting integral, short, document recirculation looped paths may be selected, and in different sequences, depending on the desired copying mode selected. The overall document recirculating path unit 10 thus provides not only a completed contiguous oval document recirculation loop 38 directly over the imaging station 18, but also reversing means and an alternative transverse intersecting bypass path 40. It may be utilized for selectably recirculating a document sheet in the recirculation loop 38, or reversing a document sheet at one side 42 of the loop 38 and or feeding it into the selectable bypass path 40 for recirculation through path 44 back to the imaging station 18, or ejection through path 46. It will be noted that here the copier imaging station is only a narrow optical scanning slit underlying only a minor portion of the document recirculation loop path 38, adjacent the one end 42 thereof. Further, the document feeding wheels 28, 30 for feeding document sheets over the imaging station at a constant speed for imaging same are also an integral part of, and provide part of the sheet movement in, the recirculation path 38. With the exception of only feed rollers 30 when they reverse in the operating modes in which sheet movement reversal there is selected, all of the other document feeding rollers disclosed in unit 10 may be commonly and unidirectionally driven. Here this includes rollers 28, rollers 48 at the upper end of loop path 42 rollers 50 at the top of paths 40 and 44 and the entrance to path 46 and rollers 52 centrally of path 44 . All these rollers are within less than one sheet length or width of one another so that a sheet is constantly engaged by at least one set of driven rollers and its mating idler rollers. The exception is rollers 48. There its idler rollers 54 are engagable and disengagable by a solenoid 56.When the document is to be reversed in path 42, where path 42 is serving as a compact reversing non inverting chute, then the solenoid 56 is temporarily actuated to open the nip with driven rollers 48 and allow slippage non engagement with the document sheet. That allows the reversal of rollers 30 to reverse the direction of document motion unobstructedly. Here that reversal, when selected, occurs after the trail edge of the document has passed a pivotable deflector gate 58. This is an automatic one way gate. It allows document sheets to feed in one direction from the imaging station 18 into the loop path 42 by the lead edge of the document deflecting the gate 58 up out of the way. However, on the reversed movement of the document sheet from the loop path 42 back towards the imaging station 18, the sheet is automatically deflected up into the entrance of bypass document path 40 leading away from the imaging station by the upper surface of gate 58, which has dropped down into the sheet path its illustrated solid line position . This automatic one way deflection gate 58 is gravity operated, i.e., gate 58 swings down about its pivot axis 60 into said deflecting position except when it is pushed up by a sheet passing thereunder from the imaging station 18. At the opposite downstream end of bypass path 40, and also in the loop 38 portion connecting between the upper downstream end of path 42 and the entrance to path 44 is a solenoid actuable two way pivotable gate 62.The gate 62, if left down in the solid line position shown, causes sheets fed out from the downstream ends of either of paths 42 or 40 to be deflected into output path 46 and thereby restacked on stack 13, via the higher speed restack ejector rollers 64 in path 46. In contrast, when gate 62 is raised to its illustrated dashed line position it deflects all sheets down into return loop path 44 leading directly back to the imaging station 18 with an inversion, via registration and feeding rollers 28, for recopying of the same sheet. However, whether the same side of the same sheet is so copied depends on whether the sheet was fed to path 44 by returning through path 42, or was reversed in path 42 and returned through path 40 instead.The former as in Fig. 2C return provides two sheet inversions in paths 42 and 44 for recopying the same side of a document, whereas the latter as in Fig. 2D return to the imaging station provides only one inversion in path 44 for copying the opposite side of the document. Referring now particularly to Figs. 2A through 2D, these illustrate schematically the document sheet paths for four different selectable modes of operation of the document handling unit 11. These and additional copying modes and their respective advantages are further described in the abovecited patents. Respectively, as so labeled, Fig. 2A illustrates a mode of operation for pre collation copying of a set or stack of simplex one sided original document sheets. Fig. 2B illustrates one mode of pre collation copying of a set of duplex two sided document sheets. See, e.g., above cited 4,229,101 for further copying details. Fig. 2C illustrates a known mode of making N any selected plural number of copies in direct sequence by the repeated circulation of a single document fed manually or one document at a time fed from a stack by the same feeder.In the latter case this will produce non collated copies. In the case of a single document, there is, of course, no difference between precollation and post collation copying, i.e., no collation is required. Thus, such immediate and direct recirculating loop copying of a single document is preferable, to as opposed to returning the document back to the stack support and back for each copy. This Fig. 2C mode can be automatically selected by the tray set counter and sensor switch detecting that there is only a single document present in the document tray. The dashed line in Fig. 2C indicates the return or ejection of the document after the desired number of recirculation loops solid line has been completed. Fig. 2D illustrates another mode of pre collation copying of a set of duplex document sheets. This copying mode is known as immediate duplex, see, e.g., above cited 4,176,945 or 4,158,500 for further copying details in that the first and second sides of each document sheet are copied immediately one after the other, rather than all of the first sides of each sheet in the whole set being copied at a time and then all of the other sides being copied, as in the Fig. 2B mode. In the Fig. 20 mode each document is reversed after copying one side and inverted and immediately returned to the imaging station for copying the second side as shown in the solid lines and then returned as shown in the dashed line to the tray for restacking. Heretofore, the selection between a stack circulation duplex precollation mode, as in Fig. 2B, and an immediate duplex mode, such as in Fig.2D, has not been practically achievable in a single integral document handler because of the different document paths required and the difficulty of providing such paths with appropriately short yet sufficiently large radius inversion loops so that the document handler can keep up with the copying rate of the copier and yet provide acceptable feeding with sufficiently low jam rates, and jam clearance accessibility of the document transport. In that regard it will be noted that the increased selectivity of operating modes provided with the document handling unit 10 also provides increased job recovery capabilities. For example, in the event of a document jam during copying, instead of recycling through the entire document set back to the particular document to be recopied for job recovery, the document to be recopied may be directly recycled in the Fig. 2C or Fig. 20 path modes to make an additional copy therefrom. That is, certain of the illustrated copying modes, even though not normally utilized for copying with a particular copier processor, may be specially utilized in the event of a document jam for making up additional copy sheets which are needed to complete incomplete copy sets,i.e., to replace sheets removed from the copier during the job recovery jam clearance . It may be seen that the selection of any of the above described modes of operation, and others, can be accomplished, as exemplified here, simply by the actuation or non actuation of the deflector gate 62 and the reversal or non reversal of the feed wheels 30 together with the actuation of the solenoid 56 . This selection can provide for the alternatives of returning the document sheet through selected loop paths directly back to the copying station, either inverted or not inverted, or further alternatively returning the document sheet directly back to the top of the stack 12, again, either inverted or not inverted, after copying only one side thereof, or after having copied both sides thereof, and after copying the document sheet once, or after the document sheet has been copied a plural number of times. Thus it may be seen that further and additional copying modes and or job recovery modes are available in addition to those disclosed in Figs. 2A through 2D. Note, for example, that the Fig. 2B copying mode with its single natural inversion on path 42, will leave the stack 13 of documents inverted at the end of an odd number of document set circulations. By automatically switching to the Fig. 2A copying mode for the last document set circulation that can be avoided, i.e., the documents will restack in their initial orientation face down .
