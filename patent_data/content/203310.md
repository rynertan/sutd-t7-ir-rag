# APPARATUS COMBINING EXTERNAL COUNTERPULSATION MASSAGE AND EXTERNAL CARDIAC MASSAGE

## Abstract
A combinated device is provided for a micro computerized and enhanced type of external counter pulsation and extrathoracic cardiac massage apparatus. In addition to balloons for the 4 limbs, the device comprises a pair of lower abdomen buttock ballons and a chest balloon. It is controlled by microcomputer process. The various sets of balloons are sequentially inflated from the distal portion to the proximal por tion during the diastolic period of the heart beat. The pressure is applied from the distal to the proximal portion gradually onto the 4 limbs, lower abdomen but tock and lower portion of the sternm.At the beginning of the cardiac systole all of the balloon deflate simultaneously. The cycle is then repeated. This de vice is used for the treatment of diseases of the heart, the brain, the kidneys, the ischemic disease of the retina and the peripheral vascular disease with appa rent curative effect. For those cases of sudden car diac arrest, the computer gives orders according to need, so that the above mentioned sets of balloons exert pressure sequentially from the distal portion to the proximal portion to force the blood to the abdomen, the chest and the head. Thereafter the device deflates suddenly, and then again the balloons sequen tially inflate from the proximal portion to the distal portion to force blood back to the lower portion of the body. Thus the circulation goes on wavelike in succession to support adequate output as well as ade quate cardiac blood inflow, and improves the effect of resuscitation.

## Description
The present invention relates to a new instrument for physical treatment. Virtually, it provides a new type of combination for a computerized and enhanced model of external counterpulsation and extra thoracic massage apparatus. In the American Cardiavascular Journal 32 10 656 661. 1973 Dr. Cohen has reported a device for exter nal counterpulsation, a four limb sequential counter pulsation device. It consists of multiple balloons wrapped around the four limbs of the patient. The pressure is applied sequentially from the distal por tion to the proximal portion of the four limbs. Using high pressure gas for its source of energy 1000 1750 mm Hg and by controling the time of opening of the solenoid valve, the balloons receive a fixed amount of air during inflation and by using a vacuum pump the balloons deflate. The necessity of using a large air compressor vacuum pump set and pressure monitoring device insures that no excessive pressure is exerted in the ballons. However this bulky device causes loud noise in this complicated operation, and at high cost, so that it is not suitable for clinical use. The inventor of the above mentioned device, however has introduced and adopted another device of sequen tial counterpulsation on the four limbs without the source energy from high pressure gas and the vacuum pump. The device makes use of a low pressure large flow pump to supply oil free gas. In this way the size of the apparatus is decreased and the noise is reduced to below 62 dB. Owing to the adoption of a larger chan nel and fixed time of inflation 100 ms and kee ping the pressure in the gas reservoir at 270 300mmHg, the pressure in the balloons is constant. There is no need to install a pressure monitoring system, and so the operation is relatively simple. The diastolic pre ssure is augmented by 32 . Ear pulse wave has shown that the ratio of diastolic wave amplitude to that of systolic wave amplitude D S is equal to 1.32 0.19. The clinical and experimental data have shown that in order to get better counterpulsation effect and to promote the establishment of collateral circu lation it is necessary to raise the diastolic pressure to a certain level. In that device of counterpulsation the augmenta tion of diastolic pressure is not conspicuously enough. Besides, the ECG analogue filter, the R wave detector and the R R integrator of the inflation deflation pro cessing device are all part of the analogue circuit. There fore, the control of inflation deflation timing is less accurate and their range is small. The device has no automatic delay control function, occupying more space and emitting a loud noise. The bed for counter pulsation is flat and therefore uncomfortable for the patient. The clinical results are not satisfactory Besides, the extrathoracic cardiac massage appara tus in current use is one that is placed at the low er portion of the sternum. The massage head is perio dically lowered down and presses over the sternum so that pressure is exerted over the heart and the great vessel underneath, thus drives the blood to the perip hery to achieve resuscitation. Yet this method cannot expel an adequate amount of blood from the heart and the big vessels in the left chest. The amount of blood expelled is limited and cannot meet the physiological requirements. When the chest receives pressure the venous blood is expelled from the chest cavity. Due to the relaxation of the peripherical vessels, a great amount of blood is stored in the blood vessels, which in turn causes brain anoxia. Besides, the brain anoxia and the relaxation of the peripheral vessels, a great amount of blood is stored in the blood vessels so that the return of venous blood to the heart is decressed, central venous pressure is low , cardiac output dimi nishes, the arterial perfusion to the brain is low and is even lower to the cardiac muscles. Through years of clinical practice this method has proved that it offers less chance of resuscitation. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a combinated device for an external counterpulsation and extrathoracic cardiac massage apparatus. Its purpose is to augment the diastolic press ure of the aorta and cardiac output , to improve anoxe mia and thus to effect the counterpulsation and res uscitation more efficiently. Another object of the present invention is to pro vide a control system of the combinated device for external counterpulsation and extrathoracic cardiac massage, which has the ability to select the proper time of inflation and deflation in relation to the exact time of the pulsation. This will improve pre cision of control of the timing of inflation and deflation. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a combinated device of external counterpu lsation and extrathoracic cardiac massage, the volume of which is small, with well muffled noise, and easy operation for clinical use. A further object of the present invention is to provide a special bed for treatment with the combina ted device for external counter pulsation and extra thoracic massage. This bed gives the patient a comfort and proper placement of the massage apparatus, and thus achieves a better result of the treatment. Additional objects, advantages, and other novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned with the practice of the invention. To achieve the foregoing and other objects, a dec reasing pressure grading is applied to the lower limb sequentially from the distal to the proximal portion, thus to prevent the impediment of the blood from re turning to the heart. Besides, a pair of lower abdomen buttock balloons and a chest balloon are added. The control system of the combinated device for external counterpulsation and extrathoracic cardiac masage consists of a single board microcomputer, ADC, DAC, counter and LED. The control system controls sequen tially the device of processing inflation and defla tion as well as the monitoring device. Under the control of the microcomputer, , the signal of ECG triggers a mechanical system which exerts pressure over the lower limbs, buttock and lower portion of the abdomen as well as the chest during diastole. In this way a large amount of blood is driven back to the aorta. In connec tion with the return of the blood, pressure is applied by the extra thoracic massage instrument so that the amount of blood reaching the brain, the heart, the kid neys and the liver would be considerable, which is qui te enough to maintain physiological requirements. This will improve the effect of counterpulsation and resuscitation. While in systole, all the parts exerting pressure are quickly relieved. Owing to the decrease in intravascular pressure , the systolic pressure is lowered, thus the resistance is lowered when the heart contracts, After load and the oxygen consumption of the heart is thus diminished. In addition , a counterpulsation bed is provided, which is especially suited for the combinated device for external counterpulsation and extrathoracic car diac massage apparatus for clinical use. The bed is designed in accordance with the physiological curva ture of the body with respect to its concave and con vex surface. The ends of the bed can be raised and lowered. There are noise muffling hoods over and beneath the bed. The cardiac massage device is placed in a fixed position. Thus the bed is kept off the noise to leave the patient in a comfortable state while giv ing efficiency to the treatment. In a further aspect of the invention, in accordance with its objects and purposes , a method is applied through the use of the combinated device for external counterpulsation and extrathoracic cardiac massage on sudden cardiac arrest patients and on those patients with organ anoxia while the heart is still pumping. For the sudden cardiac arrest patient, the device by means of computer control, sends out a pulse signal with a frequency of 30 80 times per minutes. Each pulse signal indicates a pressurized cycle, each of which triggers a mechanical system, which again, when the heart is in diastole, sequentially applies a decreas ing pressure grading from the distal to the proxi mal portions on the balloons wrapped around the legs, the thighs, the liver abdomen buttock and the chest . This will force the blood to the body to supply the main organs, as the brain, the heart, the kidneys, the lungs and the liver, etc., and to maintain effective and near physiological state blood circulation. While in systole all the balloons deflate simultaneously. Thereafter the balloons over the chest and the lower abdomen buttocks are sequentially infla ted, to drive blood to the lower parts of the body for the use of the next pressurized cycle. For those patients recovering from cardiac resus citation , yet with a lower return blood wave during the diastolic phase of the heart beat, and also for those patients with organ ischemia , the combinated device under the control of the computer will improve their blood supply and promote the establishment of collateral circulation. The computer will first detect QRS wave as a signal to trigger a mechanical system which, during cardiac diastole, will sequentially inf late with pressure grading the balloons wrapped around the legs, the thighs, the liver abdomen buttock and the chest. This will drive a large amounts of bl ood to the aorta and produce another set of pulse to perfuse the organs, such as the brain, the coronary arteries, the kidneys, the lungs, etc. The balloons, in the next cycle of the cardiac systole,will deflate ra pidly, so as to lower intravascular pressure, to less en the after load, and to decrease the oxygen consump tion of the heart. A preferred embodiment of this invention is shown an described in the following description, simply by way of illustration of one of the modes best suited to carry out the invention. The several details of the invention are capable of modification in vari ous, obvious aspects all without departing from the in vention. Accordingly, the drawing and description will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be illustrated in detail following the acco mpanying drawings. Reference is now made to Figure 1 showing the com binated device used for counterpulsating a patient with organic ischemia, signal of R wave of ECG or ear pulse wave through ECG amplifier 2 or ear pulse wave amplifier 3 , passing through the single board computer 1 with a preset program of automatic control time delay, then through a power amplifier 31 to trigger opening sequentially 4 inflation solemoid valves 5a , 5b , 5c , 5d , in the gas distribution box, thus rendering positive pressure gas in gas rese rvoir 7 connected from gas pump 6 , in a fixed time passing respectively through inflation solenoid valves 5a , 5b , 5c , 5d in the gas distribution box, thus rendering positive pressure gas in the gas reservoir 7 connected from gas pump 6 , in a fixed time passing respectively through inflation solenoid valves 5a 5b 5c 5d and pipes ga , gb , gc , gd and then ce entering into and inflating sequentially and res pectively each set of balloons wrapped around the body of the patient from distal to proximal portions. These sets of balloons are leg balloons 9a and upper limb balloons 9a thigh balloons 9b , buttock balloons 9c as well as chest balloon 9d . Except for the chest balloon 9d , each set of the other 4 sets of balloons is composed of symmetrically placed double balloons on both sides of the limbs and buttocks. The inflated balloons exert pressure on the respective parts of the body, yet with a decreasing pressure grading from distal to proximal parts, so that the bl ood in the 4 limbs and buttocks is driven back to the chest ,and thence to the trunk and the head. After the completion of inflation, in accordance with the preset program of controlled deflation time in single board computer by the operator, the time is a suitable one before occurrence of the next R wave in ECG, to trig ger simultaneously the opening of 4 deflation solenoid valves 10a 10b 10c 10d in the gas distribu tion box 4 , and to render deflation of all balloons that exert pressurs on the body. These balloons are the leg balloons 9a and the upper limb balloons 9a the thigh balloons 9b , the buttock balloons 9c and the chest balloon 9d . After the completion of de flation, blood is driven to the lower limbs until the next cardiac cycle, the same sequence of events is re peated. The gas pump 6 though connecting pipes supp lies positive pressure gas to gas distribution box 4 . The gas pump 6 is a greaseless membrane type of low pressure, large flow. The single board computer 1 is connected to the display unit 48 for dsplay ing ECG or ear pulse wave. In case the combinated device used in rescueing a patient with cardiac arrest without showing ECG or ear pulse wave, in their stead, the computer, according to the selected preset constant 20 dispatches pulsed signals with a frequency of 30 80 times per minute, after the completion of the above mentioned program of inflation deflation balloons, then the power ampli fier 31 triggers the sequential opening of inflation salenoid valves 5d and 5c in the gas distribution box 4 the positive pressure gas in the gas reser voir 7 enters the chest balloon 9d and the lower abdomen buttock balloons 9c to exert pressure on the respective parts and to drive blood to the lower limbs more effectively. After the completion of the inflation, the deflation valves open simecltaneously, thus gas in chest balloon 9d and lower abdomen buttock is expelled to the atmospher. After the completion of deflation, ano ther pulsed signal appears, and the same program is repeated. In figure 2a is a pair of lower abdomen buttock ball oons 9c symmetrically placed on the right and left sides, inserted into the interleaves of a bag 11 tailed to profile of the buttock and being able to be wrapped onto it tightly . Each balloon when lying flat has a surface area of more than 300 cm², and an internal pressure 160 250 mmHg, lower than that in the leg balloons 9a and the thigh balloos 9b . As shown in Figure 2b, the bag 11 is wrapped onto and fixed to the buttocks by nylon fasteners. Figure 3a represents the structure of a hard extratheracic cardiac massage apparatus with a massa ge head , whose casing is of either a cubic or circu lar box 14 in which the chest balloon 9d with its channel 13 is located . At the center of the top and bottom of the box, there is a hole 19 19 . The balloon channel 13 passes through the top hole 19 to connect the pipes 8D coming from the inflation deflation solenoid valves 5d and 10d . Located closely underneath the chest balloon 9d is a push board 15 , the center of the board bottoom is fixed to a rod 42 which passes through the hole 19 in the bothom of the box with a spring 17 attached. The other end of the rod is fixed to a massage head. A regulating screw 18 is inserted between the push board 15 and the casing . In static condition, both the push board 15 and the massage head 16 are pus hed upward by the spring 17 , so as to empty the chest balloon 9d . During inflation distention of the chest balloon 9d , the push board 15 moves downward by pressure , and thus the massage head 16 moves dounward too, to press tightly onto the lower end of the sternum. The moving distance between the two is 2,5 to 5 cm. The pressure exerted is 35 to 50 Kg. By adjusting the regulating screw, the moving distance as well as the pressure can be controlled. During defla tion of the chest balloon 9d both the push board 15 and the massage head 16 return to their original position by means of the spring 17 . The chest ballon 9d ,when lying flat, has a surface area of 100 to 150cm on one side, and the pressure after inflation is 0.35 to 0.50 kg cm. Figure 3b and 3c either is a structure diagram of a soft massage apparatus which can be wrapped and fixed around the chest. That wrapped around the chest is a ring shaped bag 14 , made of leather, leatheret or woven fabric and being able to be fastened together by a nylon fastener. Inserted in the bag 14 is a chest balloon 9d while the channel 13 of the ball oon passes through a hole 19 in the bag and is con nected with the pipes 8d coming from the inflation deflation solenoid valves 5d and 10d which are connected to the chest balloon too. In Figure 3b , un derneath the chest balloon 9d is a push board 15 , the bottom of which is connected to a cardiac massage head 16 . Both of them are wrapped together in the bag 14 . When in use, the massage head 16 is placed to the lower part of the sternum. While in Figure 3c, only the chest balloon 9d is in the bag 14 without the push board and massage head. When in use, the chest balloon 9d as well as the bag 14 is tightly applied to the lower part of the sternum. Reference is now made to the schematic diagram of the systematic electric circuit of the combinated device as shown in Figure 4 . During counterpulsation, the ECG wave through its amplifier 2 , ear pulse wave through its amplifier 3 or a preset constant 20 entering into the main electric circuit, pass through ADC 21 to be digital signals sent into CPU 22 . The ECG amplifier 2 is composed of a two level amplifier with amplification factor of 500, 1000 and 2000, to yield voltage level signal to ADC 21 , CPU 22 , EPROM 23 , RAM 24 , CTC 25 , LED 26 , counter 27 , PIO 28 , DAC 34 , 34 in the main electric circuit, and through A D transformation , to filter and detect QRS wave gronps, making a timed com puterization and display. In order to insure that the electric circuit has a common mode rejection ratio above 90 dB, it makes use of a preamplifier comprising three computing amplifiers, one of which is a main amplifier, while the other two are followers. Ear pulse wave amplifier 3 is a two level amplifier compris ing two computing amplifiers, with an amplification factor of 500,1000 and 2000,and amplifying the signals received by light sensitive diode to voltage level,whi ch the signal through processing by the main elec tric circuit is ready for display. ECG amplifier 2 and ear pulse wave amplifier, each of which has an emitter follower to match the main electric circuit, limiting the ontput signal to below 5 volts, thus pro tecting ADC 21 . CP 22 is timed by CTC 25 ,under the control of the storage instruction in EPROM 23 , through digi tal filtering of ECG or ear pulse wave, to input digital signals into RAM 23 , and detect QRS wave groups from ECG or ear pulse wave. According to the following formulae, timing constants may be obtained Inflation time T₁ is the time interval between R wave to the time of the beginning of inflation. Defla tion time T₂ is the time interval between T₁ and the time of the beginning of deflation. C₁ and C₂ in the formnlae are formed by preset constant in subroutine, and C₁ is related to factors as the time delay con trol due to electric or mechanical factors and the patient s individual variation . To keep the inflation time at an optimum the system can automatically follow the variations of the pulse rate and thus adjust the time when to begin the inflation . It needs only to adjust C₁ to augment the diasto lic pressure to a suitable level. C₂ is the time inter val between the time of deflation and the next R wave. The above formula 1 is derived and simplified from the empirical formula T₁ 0.4 Tr C₁ tracing error less than 10 ms . In order to trace the R R period Tr variation acc urately and to diminish the influence of random fac tors, first the average value of Tr is obtained by adding two Tr and dividing by 2 then take next normal Tr those deviationfrom mean is less than 120 ms , and according to the formula Tr 2, rectify of the last time. After deriving the time T₁ of the beginning of inflation and the time T₂ of the beginning of defla tion, from A port of PIO 28 it delivers a control signal of the beginning of inflation and deflation to the inflation deflation processing device to drive solenoid valve sets 32 , and thus to control infla tion and deflation of the balloons. The sequential processing device consists of a sequential control circuit 30 , of which the 8D trigger is the main com ponent, and a power amplifier 31 at each level of the electric circuit. The pulse rate and the time of the beginning of inflation and deflation, as computed by CPU 22 , are sent to two sets of LED 26 of 3 digits for displaying. CPU 22 controls counter 27 and th rough DAC 34 produces X axis scan serrated wave, which is then sent to an X axis deflection system 35 of the monitor. CPU 22 fetches the signal from RAM 24 and through B port of PIO 28 , the signal is sent to another DAC 34 forming the Y axis deflection 36 system of the monitor. Under the action of the function swi tch, the signal can be displayed dynamically or sta tically or the speed of scanning can be varied. The timing alarm signal for one hour conterpulsation is sent to timed alarm 36 by CPU 22 , to give visual and audible alarm. CPU 22 sends blank signals while PIO 28 sends synchronous signals to the monitoring device 39 . The monitoring device consists of the power amplifying circuit of the X, Y deflation system 35 36 , syn chronous and blanking signal amplifying circuit 40 41 , high voltage circuit and CRT not shown . Under the control of the main circuit, the monitor displays synchronously double track 3 signals ECG signal, inflation deflation signal, ear pulse wave signal or double track 2 signals ECG signals and inflation deflation signals , and possesses the ability of lock ing images. The main functions of the electric circuit of the combinated device, such as ECG digital filteration, QRS wave gronp detection, pulse rate calculation, inf lation deflation timing calculation, protection of automatic deflation, functioning of double track sig nals and image locking and time based scanning serrated wave are all performed by software. Once power is on, the system goes to zero suppres sion automatically, and executes an initial program, sets A port of PIO in the position of control and B port in the state of output. 2000 203F in 2K ROM is the data area of the system. which stores time variable para meters of the system, such as pulse rate and the time of beginning of inflation and deflation. 2047 27FF stores digital signals of two channels. After initi alization of the computer, through A D of ADC, the di gital signals of ECG undergo a two point smoothing pro cess, thence through digital fitteration, 50 HZ dis turb signals are taken off. Then through QRS wave group discrimination program, detect QRS wave group through pulse rate subroutine calculate pulse rate, and through inflation deflation subroutine compute in flation deflation timing interval. When the interrup tion of timed 10ms, as produced by CTC, happens, exec ute the digital display subroutine. When interpointer of signal display adds 1, the data in the storage area alternate incessantly. Read the data in channel 1 CH₁ first, thereafter read the data in channel 2 CH₂ , and read out alternatively the two interleaved channels. Due to incessant change of the data in the storage area, dynamic signals are displayed on the screen, with each displaying for 10ms of which 5ms for read out the data, and 5ms for changing the data. When the image is being locked, new data stop to enter the storage area. Then the original data is repeatedly read out in the storage area for resident displaying. In the soft ware of the system, the suitable time for the beginning of inflation T₁ ranges from 10 to 850ms, while the time for the beginning of deflation T₂ ranges from 5 to 800ms. The range can be increased by a re vision of the software. Although a patient may lie on an ordinary bed for treatment, yet it is far better to utilize a special counterpulsation bed in question for the pati ent in using this combinated device. The special counterpulsation bed, as shown in Figure 5, is design ed in accordance with the physilolgical curvature of the human body with respect to its concave and convex surfaces. The end of the bed can be raised or lowered down, and a noise muffler 43 is placed underneath the bed, the gas distribution box 4 being under its cover. Another noise muffler 43 which can rotate by 220 and be detached if not desired, is placed at the end of the bed. Holes 44 are made in the bed for pass age of pipes that connect inflation solenoid valves to their respective balloons. When the bed is used for a patient with cardiac arrest, it is better to place a specially made supporting board 45 on the bed, for a patient to lie on back. Four tapes 46 are attached to four corners of the supporting board for use to secure the hard cardiac massage apparatus to a suit able position, so that the massage head can be accura tely placed over the lower end of the sternum as shown in Figure 2A. It is also possible to use soft massage apparatus with a massage head as shown in Figure 2b, or to use a soft massage aparatus without massage head, yet with poor results. For use on a counterpulsating pati ent, the supporting board 45 on the counterpulsation bed may be taken away, while the soft massage appara tus without massage head as shown in Figure 3c should be used. Figure 6 represents the controlled pulse time se quence of the combinated device of the present inven tion used for a patient with cardiac arrest. Under the control of the microcomputer, pulsed signals are generated with a frequency of 30 80 times per minte to control sequentially the inflation and deflation of the ball oons, through trigger 8D to deliver control pulse in sequence, and through power amplification to drive re spective solenoid valves, thence the balloons in strict accordance with the set sequence and time, undergo inflation and deflation. In Figure 6, the square waves above the base line represent the pulses for inflation, while those below the base line repressent the pulses for deflation. The width of the square wave represents the time interval for opening either inflation solenoid valves or deflation solenoid valves, and each blank in abscissa represents 40ms. Square wave 51 respresents opening of sole noid valve 5a which renders inflation of leg balloon 9a and upper limb balloons 9a . Square wave 52 represents opening of solenoid valve 5b which renders inflation of the thigh balloons, square wave 53 repre sents opening of solenoid valve 5c which renders in flation of the lower abdomen buttock balloons 9c . Square wave 54 represents opening of solenoid valve 5d which renders inflation of the chest balloon 9d . Squa re wave 55 represents simultaneous opening of 4 sets of deflating solenoid valves 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d which render simultaneous deflation of 5 sets of balloons. The time interval of square waves 54 and 55 can be adjusted in the range of 50 to 150ms. Square wave 56 represents reopening of solenoid valve 5d which causes inflation of the chest balloon 9d inserted in the massage apparatus. Square wave 57 represents reopening of the solenoid valve which renders inflation of lower abdomen buttock balloon. Square wave 58 re presents simultaneous deflation of the chest balloon 9d and the lower abdomen buttock balloon. In this way, the process of massage cycle is completed. The cycle may be repeated or varied according to the change of the time interval between square waves 55 and 56 as well as between square wave 58 and the first square wave 51 in the next cycle. Its range is 30 to 80 times per minute. The number of repetitions can be set according to need. Figure 7 represents the controlled pulse sequence of the combinated device of the present invention used for patients with heart beat. The device detects patient s ECG, under the control of the microcomputer through trigger 8D, the QRS wave trigger controlled pulse in sequence as shown in Figure 7, through power amplification to drive respective solenoid valves rendering inflation and deflation of the balloons in strict accordance with the set sequence and the time. A comparison between Figure 7 and Figure 6 shows that the massage cycle includes only the se quential inflation and simultaneous deflation of the leg balloons 9a and the upper limb balloons 9a , the thigh balloons 9b , the lowe abdomen buttock balloons 9c and the chest balloon 9d . When the above mentioned combinated device is used in counterpulsating a patient with ischemic organ, the pipes 8a will connect the first set of infla tion solenoid valve 5a and deflation solenoid valve 10a to the leg balloons 9a and upper limb balloons 9a . As an alternative, the upper limb balloons 9a can be taken away while not in use, the inflation 5a and deflation solenoid valves 10a connected solely to the leg balloons,or the chest balloon 9d may be taken away, or the chest balloon 9d and the upper limb balloons can be taken away together. Yet the use of the chest balloon 9d will give the better result. The clinical and experimental data have shown that when performing counterpulsation and extratheracic cardiac massage, the time interval for sequential in inflation of each set of balloons is best set at 40 to 120 ms, the time duration for inflating balloons is 75 to 120 ms. The positive pressure gas from the gas reser voir in passing through the solenoid valves and entering into the balloons for inflation results in a variation in pressure, since the size of each set of balloons is different while the time of inflation is the same. The pressure in the leg balloon 9a and the upper limb balloons 9a is approximately 250 to 300mmHg, that pre ssure in the thigh balloons 9b is approximately 220 to 270mmHg, and that pressure in the lower abdomen buttock balloons is approximately 200 to 250mmHg. The de flation time lasts for 100 120ms. The adoption of the above mentioned method of se quential inflation and dereasing pressure grading will drive a sufficient amount of blood in the lower part of the body back to the trunk, thus diastolic pressure will be augmented conspicuously, to render most patients D S ear pulse wave deastolic amplitude systolic amp litude 1.2, and even to reach 2 to 4 for some of them. In a patient with sudden cardiac arrest, when the blood is returning to the arch of aorta, an inflation pres sure of 0.35 to 0.5Kg cm² is required to inflate the chest balloon 9d of the extratharacic cardiac mass age apparatus to cause a downward movement of 2.5 to 5cm of the massage head 16 , and to exert a pressure of 35 to 50Kg over the lower portion of the sternum, in order to produce a heart stroke with a stroke volume of 40 100cc. When the combinated device of the present inven tion is used as external counterpulsation for clinical treatment of patients with coronary heart disease nad angine pectoris, the symptoms after external couter pulsation have been relieved in most patients with a rate of effectiveness of 90.3 further more conspicu ous effects have been seen in patients with ischemic diseases of the brain, the retina, the kidney and the peripheral vessels. The results will be much better, if at the time of external counterpulsation, an intra venous dripping of thrombolytic drugs is used. The chance of resuscitating a patient with sudden cardiac arrest is greater in using this combinated device than ordinary extrathoracic cardiac massage apparatus. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teaching.
