# Method and means for filling of bulk material in flexible containers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and means for filling of bulk material, especially fluidized material, in flexible containers. Said material is filled through a filling pipe 3 while the container A is hanging on a double, load carrying hook 1 and simultaneously is resting against a supporting plate 5 . The lifting loops of the container are hereby stretched out during the whole filling operation. When filling of the container is completed, the hook and the supporting plate or plane are lowered simultaneously and said plane is also moved sideways, whereby the filling pipe is freed from the container. An external lever is then put into the lifting loop and the hook is opened, whereupon the container can be removed from the filling apparatus without having had any opportunity to tilt. The filling apparatus comprises a double hook which lower section can be opened while the hook is still in load carrying operation. The hook is connected to a holding device 2 which preferably is movably con nected to the plane for carrying the container. Said plane can be moved both horizontally and vertically.
