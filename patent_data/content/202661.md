## Description
Castanospermine is an alkaloid having the following formula Systematically, this compound is named 1S,6S,7R,8R,8aR 1,6,7,8 tetrahydroxyindolizidine. The isolation of this compound from Several publications have appeared which describe castanospermine as an inhibitor of a number of plant enzymes. See Y.T. Pan, et al., Acarbose, or Bay g 5421, is described in In It has now been found that castanospermine possesses digestive enzyme inhibitory properties and thus can be used as an antidiabetic agent and as an inhibitor of increased lipid biosynthesis. Thus, when carbohydrate is ingested either as glucose or in a form such as maltose, sucrose or starch in food or drink, the blood glucose level rises to elevated concentrations. In healthy subjects, this hyperglycemic state quickly returns to normal, the glucose in the blood being rapidly metabolized and stored and or utilized by the organism. In diabetes mellitus, however, the glucose tolerance of the patient is lowered and the abnormally high blood sugar levels which develop remain elevated for prolonged periods of time. A similar response to that seen in man can also be observed in other animals, including livestock, poultry, pet animals and laboratory animals. Such a condition can be described as postprandial hyperglycemia. One method for treating such a condition would be by administration of some substance which would prevent the conversion of complex sugars to glucose and thus prevent the development of the excessive glucose levels. In the present invention, it has been found that, where the high levels of glucose are a result of the hydrolysis of complex sugars, administration of castanospermine inhibits the initial formation of glucose in the blood and thus makes it possible to avoid the problems which would be associated with prolonged high levels of blood sugar. Equivalent to castanospermine for the purposes of this invention are the salts of castanospermine with pharmaceutically acceptable acids and, particularly, with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, methanesulfonic acid and The mechanism whereby the above result is achieved is the following although the utility described above should not be limited by the precise details of this mechanism. Enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates convert non absorbable carbohydrate into absorbable sugars. The rapid action of these enzymes leads to acute and undesirable elevations in blood glucose in diabetes. The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of these enzymes and, when co administered with a carbohydrate meal, they prevent harmful hyperglycemic excursions of this type. This inhibition of the formation of glucose can be useful in other ways too. Thus, the carbohydrates ingested by an organism appear in the form of glucose and are metabolized into lipids such as triglycerides, cholesterol or phospholipids. Too large a carbohydrate intake results in increased biosynthesis of lipids, causing hyperlipemia and excessive accumulation of lipids, both in adipose tissue and in other systems in the organism which can lead to obesity, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and other kinds of heart diseases. The inhibition of the formation of glucose accomplished by castanospermine would thus be useful in the control of these other conditions. The present Application also describes a process for the isolation of castanospermine from The following test procedures can be used to demonstrate the activity of castanospermine. Male ICR swiss mice with body weight of 25 35 g were fasted overnight. Sucrose was administered orally by gavage at a dose of 2 g kg 15 minutes after the similar administration of castanospermine at doses of 0.125 to 60 mg kg. Animals were sacrificed at 30 minutes after sucrose administration and blood glucose levels were measured by a method using glucose dehydrogenase. The results are shown in Table 1 below. The increase in glucose in the blood could be significantly inhibited by administering castanospermine at a dose of 0.125 mg kg or higher. Male ICR Swiss mice with body weight of 25 35 g were fasted overnight. Starch was administered orally by gavage at a dose of 1 g kg 15 minutes after the similar administration of castanospermine at doses of 1.9 to 60 mg kg. Animals were sacrificed at 45 minutes after starch administration and blood glucose levels were measured by a method using glucose dehydrogenase. The results are shown in Table 2 below. The increase in glucose in the blood could be significantly inhibited by administering castanospermine at a dose of 3.8 mg kg or higher. In practicing this invention, an amount of castanospermine effective to inhibit postprandial hyperglycemia is administered to a mammal in need thereof by a suitable route. For the purposes of this invention, oral administration is preferred. The effective amount of the compound, that is, the amount sufficient to inhibit postprandial hyperglycemia, depends on various factors such as the size, type and age of the animal to be treated, the particular compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt employed, the frequency of administration, the severity of the condition and the time of administration. Generally speaking, the compounds would be administered orally at a dose of 10 mg to 500 mg at mealtime, with a dose of 40 mg to 200 mg being preferred. More specifically, the present compounds would be administered to humans in single unit doses individual capsules containing 50 mg of active ingredient with the material being administered three times a day at mealtime. In practicing this invention, the active ingredient can be incorporated in a composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and from about 5 to about 90 percent by weight of castanospermine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The term pharmaceutical carrier refers to known pharmaceutical excipients useful in formulating pharmaceutically active compounds for internal administration to animals, and which are substantially nontoxic and non sensitizing under conditions of use. The compositions can be prepared by known techniques for the preparation of tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups, emulsions, dispersions and wettable and effervescent powders, and can contain suitable excipients known to be useful in the preparation of the particular type of composition desired. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and formulation techniques are found in standard texts, such as The following example is presented to illustrate the present invention.
