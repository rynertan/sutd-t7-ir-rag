## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR USE IN ION SELECTIVEELECTRODE MEASUREMENTS This invention relates to ion selective electrode measurements and is particularly applicable to the continuous monitoring of pH levels of, for example, boiler feed water. Apparatus for this purpose, has hitherto typically comprised a flow cell through which a sample of the boiler feed water is directed, the flow cell having mounted therein a pH sensor consisting, for example, of a glass electrode and a reference electrode. At perodic intervals it is necessary to standardize the apparatus with the use of a reference solution of known pH, and in many systems this involves removing the electrodes from the flow cell and placing them in the vessel containing reference solution. This practice is clearly time consuming, but it also introduces significant errors since a standardization is carried out in an environment which differs considerably, particularly in temperature, frozen that obtaining in the flow cell during pH measurement. The problem of achieving reliable yet rapid standard ization has been partially overcome in one proposal which provides an inlet in the apparatus for pouring reference solution directly into the flow cell. This procedure has the advantage that the electrodes are not removed from the flow cell, but there remains the risk that as a result of temperature differences between the reference solution and sample water, the apparatus may be incorrectly standardized. In addition, it is necessary with this procedure for the flow cell to be thoroughly rinsed with distilled water after it has been drained of sample water and before it is filled with reference solution this is a time consuming exercise. A further disadvantage is that whilst pH measurements are taken with the sample water flowing through the flow cell, standardization is carried out with reference solution which has been poured into the flow cell and is not flowing through the cell. This is a further possible source of error. It is an object of this invention to provide apparatus for the ion selective electrode measurement of sample liquid which may be standardized simply and quickly and in which the errors of standardization due to variations in temperature are significantly reduced if not removed. It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved method of standardizing a ion selective electrode sensor. Accordingly, the present invention consists, in one aspect, in apparatus for the ion selective electrode measurement of sample liquid, comprising a flow cell having an ionselective electrode assembly mounted therein a reference solution reservoir means including a heat exchanger connecting the reservoir with the flow cell and sample conduit means provided with a flow selector whereby sample liquid may be directed in a measuring mode through the flow cell and in a standardization mode through the heat exchanger, the passage of reference solution through the heat exchanger in the standardization mode thereby serving to equilibrate sample liquid and reference solution temperatures. In one form of the invention, the ion selective electrode assembly comprises a pH electrode and a reference electrode. In another aspect, this invention consists in a method of standardizing a ion selective electrode sensor installed in a liquid flow path and used for monitoring ion levels in a sample liquid, comprising the steps of diverting sample liquid from the sensor to a heat exchanger passing appropriate reference solution through the heat exchanger and thence to the sensor and standardizing the sensor with reference solution flowing there through. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows apparatus according to the invention in diagrammatic form. The apparatus comprises a flow cell 10 having a glass pll electrode 12, a reference electrode 14 and a temperature sensor 16 mounted therein. The electrodes and the sensor are electrically connected in known manner with a conventional pH meter. The presence of temperature sensor 16 enables the pH measurement to be temperature compensated in known manner. The flow of sample water through the apparatus proceeds, in the pH measuring mode, from a sample water inlet 20, through selector valve 22 and flow control valve 24 to a constant head unit 26. From this unit, the flow is directed to inlet 28 of the flow cell 10 with excess water from the constant head unit passing to the drain 30. The outlet 32 of the flow cell is connected to a thermometer 34 and thus to the drain 30. A reservoir 36 is charged with buffer solution and a control valve 38 at the base of the reservoir comnunicates with an inlet 40 of a heat exchanger 42, the outlet 44 of this heat exchanger being joined with the sample water conduit at Tpiece 46. The second outlet port of selector valve 22 is connected to one end of the coil of the heat exchanger 42 through pipe 48, the other end of the coil communicating via pipe 50 with the drain 30. In the normal pH measuring mode, the selector valve 22 is positioned to direct sample flow to the control valve 24 and thus to the constant head unit 26. The buffer reservoir control valve 38 is closed. Sample water passes continuously through the flow cell 10 and past thermometer 34 to the drain 30. When it is required to standardize the apparatus, the selector valve 22 is turned to direct sample flow through the coil of heat exchanger 42, and buffer control valve 38 is opened. Buffer solution passes through the heat exchanger and there rapidly assumes the temperature of the sample water. In one example, the described apparatus is used to measure the pH of ammonia ted boiler feed water with a pH range of approximately 8.8 to 9.3. The sample water is taken as a condensate and can vary in temperature from 100C to 400C. The 0 temperature coefficient in pH units is approximately 0.035t C and a pH measurement is required corrected to 250C. The 0 correction from pH at sample temperature to pH at 25 C can be achieved using a variable isopotential control, if this is available on the pH meter otherwise a variety of other methods can be employed.The buffer solution used is 0.01M borax 0 having a pil at 25 C of approximately 9.18 and a temperature coefficient in pH units of 0.008 0C. The temperature of the buffer solution will of course depend on the conditions under which it has been prepared and stored but may for example be taken as lying in the range 180C to 25or. The apparatus is arranged to bring the buffer solution 180C to 250C to the temperature of the sample solution 100C to 400C with an accuracy of 1 0C, and the dimensions of the heat exchanger are chosen to that end, taking into account the available sample flow rate. Typically, the flow of sample water through the heat exchanger required in the standardization mode will be greater than the flow of sample water required through the flow cell in the measuring mode. The flow rate at input 20 is accordingly chosen to give the the required flow through the heat exchanger say 300 cc minute and the flow control valve 24 is set to reduce this to 15 100 cc minute when the flow selector 22 is in the measuring mode position. Since the pH meter will be adjusted to correct for the temperature coefficient of pH of ammoniated water, the actual temperature of the borax solution in the standardization mode this being equal of course to the temperature of the sample water is required to be known. The thermometer 34 is used for this purpose although a sufficiently sophisticated pH meter could of course derive and display the temperature from the output of temperature sensor 16. It will be appreciated that during standardization, the buffer or reference solution flows through the flow cell in a manner identical to the flow of sample water and, in particular, at the same temperature. Accurate standardization can therefore be carried out. Furthermore, the operation of standardization involves only the actuation of selector valve 22 and control valve 38 and the allowance of sufficient time for a flow of buffer solution at the correct temperature to be established through the flow cell. With suitable design of the heat exchanger this period can be made conveniently short. It should be understood that this invention has been described by way of example only and numerous modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, for example, any suitable form of heat exchanger could be employed whilst items such as the constant head unit and control valve 24, whilst preferably included, are not essential. Although the primary usesof this invention probably lie in the field of pH measurement of boiler feed water or other sample liquids, the invention is not restricted to this application and extends to other forms of ion selective electrode measurements such as chloride ion measurements in dosed water or in process liquids. The same advantages are obtained of easier and more rapid standardization procedures coupled with the greater degree of accuracy which follows from the fact that the flow cell environment during standardization more closely approaches that during measurement.
