# Virtual memory computer system.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a virtual memory computer sys tem. In a paged, virtual memory computer system an apparatus is provided for enabling I O device adapters 4 to request the CPU 1 to allocate or resolve virtual pages into main storage pages as required for I O data transfers. The I O adapter 4 provides the channel virtual address information specifying the requested page and channel function informa tion which indicates whether the requested page is to be transferred from secondary storage into main storage 4 or merely allocated as a page in main storage 4 . The channel 3 forms the virtual address information and the channel func tion information into a page request function event which is stored in an I O event stack in main storage 4 for retrieval and processing by the CPU 1 .
