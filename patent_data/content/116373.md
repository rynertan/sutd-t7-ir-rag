The novel 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 2H 1 benzoxepinot5,4 b 1,4 oxzines of formula I can be readily prepared as illustrated in the following reaction scheme, wherein the symbols R, R1 and R2 are as defined above except that R2 cannot be hydrogen. Reaction Scheme A EMI5.1 Thus, a substituted 4 amino 2,3,4, 5 tetrahydro l benzoxepin 5 ol II can be acylated with chloroacetyl chloride in the presence of a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine to yield the corresponding substituted 2 chloro N 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 5 hydroxy 1 benzoxepin 4 yl acetamide III . The acylation can be conducted in an inert, halogenated solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride at a temperature ranging from about 100 to about 300 C. The chloroacetamido alcohol III can be cyclized with strong alkali in an aqueous alcohol solution. More particularly, cyclization can occur using a concentrated solution 50 of sodium hydroxide in isopropanol or aqueous isopropanol at room temperature for a period of from 8 to 24 hours. The substituted 4a,11b 4a,5,6,11b tetrahydro 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine 3 4H one IV so obtained is reduced using a hydride reagent or diborane in an inert organic solvent. More particuarly, lithium aluminum hydride can be favorably employed in a refluxing solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether for a period of from about 3 to 12 hours. Where the symbol R2 represents hydrogen in formula I above, the substituted 4a,lTh 3,4,4a,5,6,llb hexahydro 2H l benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazines V are obtained. Alternatively, where the symbol R2 is other than hydrogen or methyl in formula I above the resulting substituted 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazines V are conveniently acylated with an acid chloride or an acid anhydride in the presence of a trialkylamine. Acylation can again be conducted in the presence of an inert halogenated solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride to provide the corresponding substi tuted N acyl 4a, Llb 3,4,4a, 5,6,11b hexahydro 2H 1 benz oxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazines VI Reduction of these N acyl 2H fllbenzoxepino r5,4 bl 1,4 oxazines VI using a hydride or diborane reagent provide the desired 4a,llb 3, ,4a,5,6,Ilb hexdhydro 2H Ellbenzoxepinof5,4 b I 1,4 oxazines VII , wherein the symbol R2 is other than hydrogen. More particularly, lithium aluminum hydride can be favorably employed in an inert, refluxing solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl either for a period of from about 3 to 12 hours. Alternatively, where the symbol R2 represents the methyl group, it may be preferable to reduce the Ncarboxylic acid ester in lieu of the N acyl derivative in the last step of the reaction sequence. Thus, the substituted 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 2H l benzoxepino 5,4 b l,4 oxazines V can be reacted with an alkyl chlorqformate in the presence of a trialkylamine and a solvent such as chloroform or methylene chloride to provide the corresponding substituted 4a,llb 3,4,4a, 5,6,11b hexahydro 4 carboalkoxy 2H l3benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine derivatives VIII having the general formulaEMI7.1 Reduction of this 4 carboalkoxy derivative with a hydride or diborane reagent, using essentially the same procedure as for the reduction of the N acyl 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 2H l benzoxepino 5,4 b l,4 oxazine VI , provides the desired 4 methyl derivative. It is to be noted that the intermediate 4 amino 2,3, 4,5 tetrahydrobenzoxepin S ol compounds II may exist in either their cis or trans geometric isomeric forms, each of which are enantiomeric mixtures which may be separated into individual enantiomers by methods known in the art such as by the formation of diastereomeric salts.Alternatively, each enantiomer can be synthesized from an optically pure starting material. All such isomers are embraced herein although throughout this specification it is preferred, from an end use application of the compounds of this invention I , to utilize the trans isomers. The substituted 4 amino 2, 3,4, 5 tetrahydro l benz oxepin 5 ol compounds II useful as starting materials are either known compounds or compounds that can be readily prepared from known phenols or substituted phenols in accordance with the following reaction scheme Reaction Scheme B EMI8.1 Thus, phenol or a substituted phenol IX can be converted to the corresponding phenyloxybutyric acids X by heating the corresponding sodium phenolate with a slight excess of butyrolactone at a temperature of about 150 55 C. These phenyloxybutyric acids can be cyclized by heating with polyphosphoric acid at temperatures from about 55 to 1000C to yield the corresponding 2,3,4,5tetrahydro l benzoxepin 5 ones XI .The 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro l benzoxepin 5 ones so obtained XI can be dissolved in a solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol and treated with isoamyl nitrite at ice bath temperatures to form the 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro l ben2oxepin 4,5 dione 4 oximes XII . The oximino ketones XII obtained in this manner can be reduced with zinc dust in an acetic acid acetic anhydride mixture at temperatures of about 50 650C to form the corresponding 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 4 acetamido l benzoxepin 5 ones XIII . Further reduction of these compounds by means of sodium borohydride in ethanol at temperatures ranging from about 10 to 300C results in the formation of a mixture of the corresponding cis and trans 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 4 acetamido 1 benzoxepin 5 ols XIV . Recrystallization of this mixture from a solvent such as ethyl acetate or acetonitrile results in the isolation of the desired isomers, preferably the trans isomer.Hydrolysis of these isomers XIV by means of a refluxing solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide in ethanol provides the desired cis or trans substituted 4 amino 2,3 ,4,5 tetrahydro 1 benzoxepin 5 ols II , useful as starting materials for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. The compounds of this invention possess useful antihypertensive properties. In practicing this aspect of the invention an effective amount of one or more of the 2 H 1 benzoxepino 5, 4 b 1, 4 oxazines described herein are internally administered to a mammal in need thereof.

The residue is dissolved in ether and treated with an ethereal hydrogen chloride solution to precipitate the trans 4 ethyl l0 phenylmethoxy 4a,llb 3,4,4a, 5, 6,llb hexahydro 2H 13benzoxepino 5,4 1,4 oxazine hydrochloride. The 4 ethyl hydrochloride salt is dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol, shaken with hydrogen gas in a Parr shaker at 60 psi in the presence of 0.2 g of 10 palladium charcoal until hydrogen uptake ceases. The catalyst is filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The residue is triturated with ethyl acetate to yield the desired trans4 ethyl 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 10 hydroxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine as the hydrochloride salt. EXAMPLE 5Trans 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b Hexahydro 10 methoxy 4 methyl 2H 1 Jbenzoxepino 5, 4 b 1, 4 oxazine Maleate A mixture of trans 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro l0 methoxy 2H tl3benzoxepinot5,4 b3 1,4 oxazine, 3.0 ml of triethylamine and 25 ml of methylene chloride is stirred and a solution of 1.0 ml of ethyl chloroformate dissolved in 25 ml of methylene chloride is added dropwise thereto. The mixture is stirred overnight, washed with a dilute hydrochloric acid solution, followed by a saturated sodium chloride solution wash, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated and the residue is dissolved in 25 ml of tetrahydrofuran. This solution is added dropwise to a suspension of 1.0 g of lithium aluminum hydride in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The resulting mixture is refluxed for 6 hours, cooled in an ice bath and excess hydride is decomposed via the cautious addition of 4.0 ml of a 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. he mixture is stirred overnight, filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in ether, treated with an ethereal solution of maleic acid to form the maleate salt Recrystallization of this salt from a methanol ethyl acetate mixture provides 1.97 g of the desired title compound. Following essentially the same procedure but substituting trans 4a,llb 3,4, 4a, 5,6, Ilb hexahydro 8 hydroxy 2H l benzoxepino 5,4 b l,4 oxazine and trans 4a,llb 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 8,9 methylenedioxy 2H 1 benz oxepino 5,4 b l,4 oxazine for the starting material above results in the formation of trans 4a,llb 3,4,4a, 5,6,11b hexahydro 8 hydroxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine maleate and trans 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 8,9 methylenedioxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine maleate, respectively. Quite obviously, by starting with the cis isomeric forms of the compounds of the foregoing examples and by following the same procedures of these examples there are produced the corresponding cis isomers of the foregoing final compounds. EXAMPLE 6Preparation of a tablet formulation One thousand tablets for oral use, each containing 125 mg of trans 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro 10 methoxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine hydrochloride are prepared according to the following formulation Ingredients Gm a trans 4a,llb 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro lO methoxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1, 4 oxazine hydrochloride 125 b Dicalcium phosphate 150 c Methylcellulose, U.S.P. 15 cps 6.5 d Talc 20 e Calcium sterate 2.5 The trans 4a1 llb 3 ,4,4a, 5,6, lIb hexahydro lo methoxy 2H 1 benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine hydro chloride and dicalcium phosphate are mixed well, granulated with a 7.5 aqueous solution of methylcellulose, passed through a No. 8 screen and carefully dried.The dried granules are passed through a No. 12 screen, blended with talc and calcium stearate and compressed into tablets. EXAMPLE 7Preparation of a capsule formulation One thousand two piece hard gelatin capsules for oral use each containing 200 mg of trans 4a,llb 3,4,4a, 5,6,11b hexahydro 8 methoxy 2E benzoxepino rs,4 bl 1,4 oxazine hydrochloride are prepared from the following ingredients Ingredients Gm a trans 4a,11b 3,4,4a,5,6,11b hexahydro S methoxy 2H 1 benzoxepinol5,4 b 1,4 oxazine hydrochloride 200 b Lactose, U.S.P. 100 c Starch U.S.P. 10 d Talc, U.S.P. 5 e Calcium stearate 1 The finely powdered materials are mixed until uniformly dispersed and filled into hard shelled gelatin capsules of the appropriate size. In a similar fashion one piece soft gelatin capsules can be prepared in which the above formulation can be granulated, slugged or compressed directly into a rotary die or plate mold in which the capsule is formed. Alternatively, the above excipients may be omitted and the active ingredient dispensed as a powder directly into the capsule. EXAMPLE 8 The following example illustrates the anti hypertensive activity obtained with the compounds of this invention. Spontaneously hypertensive rats males, 250 300 g , obtained from the Charles Rivers Breeding Laboratories, are divided into different treatment groups of 12 rats each. On separate days, one group of 12 rats is given 3, 6 or 10 mg kg of the test compound, trans 4a,llb 3,4,4a, 5,6, llb hexahydro 10 methoxy 2H l benzoxepino 5,4 b 1,4 oxazine hydrochloride, by gavage and another group of 12 rats is given water vehicle, 5 ml kg . Systolic arterial blood pressure is recorded from the tail of each rat using an occluding cuff and transducer. Systolic arterial blood pressure is recorded prior and subsequent to the administration of drug or vehicle at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 hours post treatment. The results are indicated as follows.
