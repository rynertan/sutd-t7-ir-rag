# ROLLING MILL FOR METAL STRIP

## Abstract
A rolling mill system for the continuous rolling of metal strip or strand into a strip of predetermined thickness and straightness is disclosed, The system includes a frame in which two metal working rolls are mounted in such a way that both the distance or nip between the rolls and the tilt of one roll with respect to the other may be regulated by two gap adjusting devices mounted in the roll frame on opposite sides of the cen terline of the metal strip. At least one of the gap adjusting devices is operated responsive to a signal representing a meas urement of the straightness of the strip product. The gap ad justing devices are hydraulic assemblies wherein each piston is affixed to a piston rod and each piston rod is affixed at its op posite end to a chock block in which the movable roll is carried. A piston indicating rod which constitutes part of a position transducer is affixed to the opposite face of each piston to allow for monitoring of the actual distance between the two rolls at each end thereof. The motor drive for one roll is mounted an a door forming part of the roll mill frame to allow for free access to the rolls and chocks. The straightness or camber of the strip product is monitored and the tilt of the mov able roll with respect to the other roll is controlled responsive to signals representative of variations in camber.
