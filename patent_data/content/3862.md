# Process for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous liquids.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the removal of heavy metal ions, particularly chromium, lead and or zinc ions, from aqueous liquids by precipitation wherein the aqueous liquid containing the heavy metal ions and an aqueous liquid containing a base which precipitates the heavy metal ions in the form of their hydroxide or basic salt are added simultaneously to an amount of water at a pH between 5 and 10 and a temperature between 60 and 100 C and the pH and the temperature are maintained in the specified ranges during the precipitation.
