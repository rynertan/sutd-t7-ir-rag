# Automatic focusing apparatus for camera.

## Abstract
An automatic focusing system for a camera, compri sing a light emitting unit 26 which emits a distance measu ring light beam a condenser lens 30 which condenses the reflective light among the light beam projected from the light emitting unit and reflected by an object a light spot detector 31 disposed at the focal point of the condenser lens 30 and capable of producing first and second photoelectric currents I₁,I₂ according to the position of the focused spot of said reflective light on the light receiving surface thereof and pro viding output signals corresponding to the first and second photoelectric currents, respectively an arithmetic unit 34, 35 which process the output signals of said light spot detec tor 31 through addition and subtraction, a first variable gain amplifier 36 which amplifies an output signal of said arith metic unit 34 corresponding to the sum of the output signals of said light spot detector in response to a first control signal a second variable gain amplifier 37 which amplifies an out put signal of said arithmetic unit 35 corresponding to the difference between the output signals of said light spot de tector in response to the first control signal first and second rectifying units 41, 42 which rectify the output signals of said first and second variable gain amplifiers, respectively first and second integrators 45, 46 which receive the output sig nals of said first and second rectifying units, respectively, and provide integrated voltage signals corresponding to the output signals of said first and second rectifying units, res pectively a level decision unit 47, 48 which detects the level of the output signal of said first integrator 45 a lens encorder 57 which detects the existing focusing position of a picture taking lens 61 a comparator 56 which compares the out put signal of said second integrator 46 and an output signal of said lens encoder 57 a lens driving unit 60 which drives the picture taking lens 61 according to the output signal of said comparator 56 to an optimum focusing position an error detector 43 which receives a switching signal and said output signal of said first rectifying unit 41 and pro duces a second control signal for controlling the luminous flux density of said light emitting unit 26 and said first con trol signal for controlling the respective gains of said first and second variable gain amplifiers 36, 37 , wherein the picture taking lens is driven by said lens driving unit so as to be stopped at an optimum focusing position until the output of said lens encoder coincides with a value corresponding to an output signal of said second integrator at a moment when said level decision unit decides that the output of said first integrator is equal to a fixed value.
