# SUBMERGED BUOYANT OFFSHORE DRILLING AND PRODUCTION TOWER AND APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DEFINING AND INSTALLING SAME

## Abstract
A submerged tubular tower 10 is connected at its lower end 15 to an ocean floor 11 at a site where at least one subsea hydrocarbon well is to be drilled. A riser duct 22 for each well to be drilled extends from an up wardly accessible connection point 20 at the upper end 14 of the tower to the lower end of the tower. The tower is posi tively buoyant to stand erect in an unguyed manner. The upper end 18 of the tower is located a substantial distance above the ocean floor at a depth sufficiently small to enable wells to be drilled through the riser ducts, through equipment 19 landed on the top of the tower, using floating drilling equip ment 12 designed for use in substantially shallower water depths.
