# ELECTRICAL CONTACT UNITS AND COMPONENTS THEREOF

## Abstract
A contact unit having generally a plurality of contact assemblies 25 carried on a mounting board 15 therefor is provided. The contact assemblies 25 are each adjustably positionable along the length of one of a plurality of slots 16 provided in the mounting board 15 . The slots 16 generally form a series of parallel slots and the contact assemblies 25 have bodies 28 which can be fixed to the mounting board in any required position preferably by gluing, adhesive, fusion or welding. The contacts of the assemblies may thus be adjusted in one direction on the mounting board by move ment along a slot 16 and in the opposite direction by selection of a slot 16 for co operation with specific zones of conductive areas 2 on a juxtaposed member 1 .
