# Improved cylinder block for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
To increase the vibration damping structural rigidity of a cylinder block wherein the coolant jacket thereof is adapted to receive coolant in a liquid state and discharge same in a gase ous state, ribs are formed integrally between the outer wall of the coolant jacket and the cylinders surrounded thereby. With this arrangement as the coolant need not be forcefully circulat ed within the coolant jacket due to the nature via which heat is removed from the cylinders, the ribs may be formed in structur ally advantageous positions wherein the coolant stagnating effect caused by same is not objectionable and wherein they simultaneously increase the surface area via which the coolant is heated.
