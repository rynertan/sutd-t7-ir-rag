# Control means for vehicle automatic transmissions.

## Abstract
A vehicle automatic transmission including a torque con verter and a multiple stage transmission gear mechanism. The gear mechanism is controlled through a hydraulic system hav ing solenoid valves. An electronic control unit is provided to control the hydraulic system under a shift control map having shift up and shift down control lines. The shift down control line is determined in terms of the torque converter turbine speed and the engine throttle valve position as a line passing through points of maximumcurvature on iso engine output power lines as functions of the torque converter turbine speed and the en gine load.
