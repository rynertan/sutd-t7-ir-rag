# Synthesis of long chain alkanes having terminal functionality.

## Abstract
A process for preparing primary substitute n alkane compounds, comprising contacting the olefin product of an olefin metathesis reaction having an alpha olefin as the reactant with a bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium hydrohalide and, after contacting the product of the olefin zirconium hydrohalide reaction with an electrophilic reagent, recovering said primary substitued n alkane compound.
