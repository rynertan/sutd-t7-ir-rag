# Copper based alloy and lead frame made of it.

## Abstract
A copper based alloy for use in electrical and electronic devices, particularly as a material used for forming lead frames of semiconductor devices, which is less expensive than phosphor bronze while providing a mechanical strength and durability to repeated bending comparable with those of phosphor bronze, and also a relatively high conductivity. The inventive alloy is a copper based alloy containing 1.2 to 2.5 wt tin, 0.01 to 0.15 wt phosphorous, 0.1 to 0.6 wt nickel, 0.05 to 1 wt zinc, and the remainder being copper and minute amounts of unavoidable impurities.
