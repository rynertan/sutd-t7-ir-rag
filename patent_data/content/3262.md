## Description
MEDIUM, PROCESS AND SYSTEM FOR RECORDING INFORMATION The invention relates to a medium, process and system for recording information. More particularly the invention provides a medium having a solvent coated layer capable of being thermally deformed, during recording, in such a way that deformations occur at a high packing density, i.e., a large amount of information may be recorded per unit area of the medium. The recorded information can be read out nth a high signal to noise ratio and feimper fections or dropouts. The medium can therefore be used for high quality recording of information at high packing density, and as such is useful for the recording of video information. Solvent coated as used herein means that the layer material is coated from a liquid solution in a solvent. Media for recording information by thermally altering the physical structure of a material are known. U.S. Patent No. 3,475,760 describes a medium for recording information as a thermal deformation pattern doing so without requiring the formation of an electrical charge pattern on the medium . The medium is a 1 to 10 micron thick layer of a solventcoated thermoplastic material on a support. The patent teaches that some thermoplastic materials, modified to absorb radiation strongly at the wave length of a laser beam having a diameter of less than 10 microns, can be thermally deformed by that laser beam so that some of the thermoplastic material is displaced from the area illuminated by the beam and forms ridges along the edges of that area.This deforma tion pattern retains its shape after the laser beam is removed and may be read by projecting the pattern onto a viewing screen as a Schlieren image, and viewing the image thwoagll Schlieren optics. U.S. Patent No. 3,475,760 does not, however, teach or suggest that solvent coated materials could be used to form a medium to record video signals with such high quality that the recording could be read back with a signal to noise ratio greater than 40 decibels. Such a recording medium would be very desirable because it could then be possible, for example, to inexpensively manufacture a 30.5 cm 12 inch circular disc using solvent coating methods, the disc being suitable for recording at least one half hour of real time video programming per disc side. Newer developments such as those disclosed in U.SX Patent No. 4,023,185 provide a medium and a means for rapidly recording large amounts of informa tion in a small area in such a way that the informa tion can be read back with a high signal to noise ratio. The medium employs a thin 0.0525 micron recording layer of 4 phengazo 1 naphthylamine which z vapour deposited in a vacuum on a support. The recording means comprises a beam of high energy density radiation, such as a laser beam. Typically, the laser beam is modulated, e.g. pulsed correspond ing to a pattern of information, and focused onto the surface of the recording layer.The recording layer has reasonably high absorbance at the wave length of the laser beam so that the laser can transfer enough energy to small portions of the layer to burn, evaporate, or otherwise remove the organic material from those portions. This technique is usually referred to as ablative recording. Normally there is continuous relative motion between the laser and the layer so that, as the laser is pulsed or modulated, discrete holes of varying sizes are created in the layer. The sizes and spacing of these holes con stitute the encoded information.When a lower power laser beam of the same wavelength is arranged to follow the path of the recording beam at the same speed, the light reflected back from the recorded holes to a photodetector is converted into an electrical signal corresponding to the information recorded. As previously mentioned, U.S. Patent 4,023,185 discloses that the recording layers of such media known to be useful comprise a layer of 4phenylazo l naphthylamine. Unfo rtunat ely, this material can only be coated in layers of the desired thickness on a support by the relatively expensive and ime consuming technique ofvapour deposition in a vacuum. Belgian Patent No. 858,636 describes a material for recording the information carried by a modulated laser beam comprising a support bearing a 0.5 to 10 micron thick recording layer comprising a thermoplastic polymer having dissolved therein up to 10 percent by weight of an organic dye which provides a specular density of at least 0.1 to the layer with respect to the wavelength of the recording laser. Such recording material is said to develop light scattering onnt s with a minimum increase of white light specular density of 0.2 with respect to the background when exposed to a light energy dose of at least 1 x 106 erg cm2 2 0.1 watt sec cm with a focused laser beam having a beam intensity of at least 1.0 x 1011 erg cm2. sec. 1 x 104 watts cm2 . Information recorded on such recording material is read by scanning with the recording laser beam with its power reduced to about one tenth of that used for recording. All the recording materials mentioned above can be used to record an information modulated laser beam by thermal deformation or by ablation of a layer of laser energy absorbing material. However, none of the materials which record by thermal deformation has proved to be suitable for recording a modulated laser beam in which the modulating signal is a cdour video signal. In such a recording system the modulating signal contains at least 5 x 10 bits of information per second and the signal to noise ratio on playback must be 40 decibels or greater. The recording material described in U.S.Patent No. 4,023,185 may be able to record a colour video signal and be played back with the desired signal to noise ratio. However, this recording material cannot be prepared by the simple method of solvent coating. It must be prepared by the relatively expensive technique of vacuum evaporative deposition. Furthermore, this recording material is not reusable. The present invention provides a recording medium having the desirable characteristics described above. During experimentation with various materials for recording with a modulated argon ion laser, it was found that a high quality, high information density, recording material could be prepared by solvent coating an extremely thin, amorphous layer comprising a mixture of a thermoplastic binder and a dye which absorbs energy at the wavelength of the recording beam, i.e., 4s8 nanometers. It sms also discovered that the recorded information could be read using a loser of a different wavelength than that which the dye absorbs, e.g., a helium neon laser at 633 nanometers. Upon close inspection of the recording sur face with a scanning electron microscope, it was found that whether holes were created or not depressions surrounded by sharply defined ridges were formed in the amorphous material. The good reading made with the helium neon laser appears to be caused by the laser light scattering effect of the ridges i.e., the sharp change toward vertical in the surface of the amorphous material at the ridges from the horizontal surface of the undeformea areas causes sufficient light scattering to produce a good density variation when a reading scan is made with the helium neon laser. The present invention provides a medium for recording information pulse encoded on a high energy beam which medium comprises a support bearing a thermally deformable, solvent coated recording layer of amorphous material comprising thermoplastic binder and an absorptive substance wherein the recording layer is capable of being thermally deformed by the action of absorbed energy from the beam when focused thereon and scanned in relative motion thereto, the deformations produced in the layer comprising depressions or holes surrounded by sharply defined ridges, characterized in that the recording layer is less than 0.45 micron thick and has an absorption factor of 20 or greater at the wavelength of the beam. The recording layer is preferably less than 0.35 micron thick. It comprises an amorphous material having an absorption factor at the wavelength of a recording beam, greater than 20 and the material is capable of being thermally deformed by the recording beam without the aid of electrical charge patterns to form a hole or depression surrounded by a sharply defined ridge. The ridge and hole depression must have noticeable boundaries and sharply defined ridge means that, as measured in the plane of the undeformed outer surface of the layer and in the direction of relative motion between the recording beam and the layer, the width of the ridge is less than or equal to the breadth of the hole depression. The absorption factor of the recording layer is defined as the product of the weight percent of the absorptive substance in the layer and the extinction coefficient of that substance at the wavelength of the recording beam divided by the molecular weight of that substance. Preferably, the absorptive substance is a dye which absorbs energy at the wavelength of the recording beam. A medium according to the invention as defined can be recorded upon so that the size of each discrete deformation bit of recorded information is preferably smaller than 1.5 microns, and the information can be read back with a signal tonoise ratio of 40 decibels or greater. A recording medium in accordance with a preferred form of the invention is capableOf being recorded upon, erased, and recorded upon again. If the recording medium of the invention is to be used as a master for producing replicate recordings, it is useful in some embodiments to incorporate into the amorphous material another dye having high absorbency at a wavelength of radiation useful for recording upon a replicate recording medium. In such a case the support must be substantially transparent at that wavelength. Another useful method of producing replicates from the medium of the inventin is to deposit a metal layer on the deformed surface of the recorded medium, strip the metal layer off, and use the stripped off metal layer as a mould to press out replicate recordings. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of recording information pulse encoded on a nigh energy beam which method comprises focussing the beam on the recording layer of a recording medium which comprises a support bearing a thermally deformable, solvent coated recording layer of amorphous material comprising a thermoplastic binder and an absorptive substance which absorbs energy at the wavelength of the beam and scanning the beam in relative motion to the recording layer to produce deformations in the layer comprising depressions or holes surrounded by sharply defined ridges, characterized in that the recording layer is less than 0.45 micron thick and has an absorption factor of 20 or greater at the wavelength of the beam. The invention also provides a system for recording information pulse encoded on a high energy beam which system comprises means for producing the beam containing the pulse encoded information, a recording medium which comprises a support bearing a thermally deformable, solvent coated recording layer of amorphous material comprising a thermoplastic binder and an absorptive substance which absorbs energy at the rTave length of the beam, me as for focussing the beam on the recording layer and means for scanning the beam in relative motion to the recording layer whereby, when in use, deformations are produced in the layer comprising depressions or holes surrounded by sharply defined ridges, characterized in that the recording layer is less than 0.45 micron thick and has an absorption factor of 20 or greater at the wavelength of the beam. The invention is further illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a recording medium of the invention. Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the recording medium of Fig. 1 after it has been recorded upon, and Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a recording medium that has been recorded upon and that does not fall within the definition of the invention. It is included for purposes of comparison with Fig. 2. A recording medium of the invention is suitable for high quality, high information density recording. High quality recording as used herein is defined as a recording which when read back has a signal to noise ratio of 40 decibels or greater.and few imperfections or dropouts. High informationdensity recording as used herein is defined as a recording in which discrete bits of information are in the form of deformations having respective sizes smaller than 1.5 microns. Size is defined, referring preliminarily to Fig. 2 of the drawings, as the sum of the dimensions R plus D plus R, i.e.,the ridge width plus the depression breadth plus the ridge width, measured in the plane of the undeformed outer surface of the layer 10 and in the direction of relative motion between a recording beam and the recording layer. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, the recording medium comprises a layer 10 of amorphous material less than 0.45 micron thick coated from a solvent onto a support 20. The solvent coating may be by any of the widely known thin layer solventcoating techniques such as bar coating, spraycoating and whirl coating. The thickness M of the amorphous layer must be less than 0.45 micron because thicker layers have heat dissipation and flow properties that render them incapable of being thermally deformed by a recording beam to form the physical surface structure necessary to the practice of the invention.The layer should have a significant optical density, i.e., absorption factor of 20 or greater at the wavelength of the recording beam of choice, in order to be able to absorb sufficient energy from the recording beam to undergo proper thermal deformation. The layer preferably has a glass transition temperature significantly higher than room temperature and lower than the temperature that can be imparted to a point on the layer by the recording beam of choice. Otherwise, the layer may not be able to retain the thermal deformation pattern after recording or may not be capable of being recorded upon at all. The particular deformation structure that provides the high degree of radiation scattering necessary for high quality, high information density recording and reading according to the invention is illustrated in Fig. 2 of the drawings. Fig. 2 shows that the ridge width R is less than or equal to the breadth D of the depression or hole, dashed line 21 after recording. This provides a practical test for identifying amorphous materials suitable for use in the invention. A recording beam can be focussed on the material and then the resultant deformation viewed, for example, through a scanning electron micrcscope. By using a comparative scale, the ridge width and depression breadth can be measured in the plane of the undeformed surface and in tilL direction In which the recording beam was moved.If th rite width is not less than or equal to the breadth of the depression hole , or if the ridge and depression hole are not defined sharply enough to maIre such measurements, the amorphous material is not a useful one. In performing such a test an exposure series should be made. That is, the power of the recording beam or the recording time should be varied so that a series of attempted recordings is made which covers a range extending from the point where no deformation occurs low power or short exposure time to the point where actual vaporization or burning off of the amorphous material occurs high power or long exposure time .The measurements should then be made of the step in the exposure series that provides the most sharply defined ridge and depression, if any. Fig. 3 is included to illustrate a situa tion where the amorphous material is not a useful one or where the thickness M of the amorphous layer 30 is greater than 0.45 micron. It can be seen that in this case, after recording, the ridge width R , is greater than the depression breadth D . It will also be realized that it is difficult even to make the measurements in this case because the ridge is so ill defined that it is difficult to decide where the gently sloping ridge ends and the undeformed portion of the layer begins. The radiationscattering effect of such a gently sloping deformed tion is not sufficient for high quality, high information density recording. The amorphous materil of the invention is a mixture of a binder and an absorptive S S such as a dye chosen for its high absorptivity at the wavelength of the recording beam. The absorptive substance must be compatible with the binder be able to mix with the binder in such a way that no crystalline structure is formed , or the resultant material will not be useful for the invention. The mixture normally comprises a binder to dye ratio of 1 1 by weight, but in some cases at may be preferred to increase the ratio to 3 1 or more or to decrease the ratio to 1 3 or less. In some cases it may also be useful to include a plasticizer in the mixture to achieve the desired deformation capabilities.As mentioned previously the amorphous material must also be soluble in a solvent, such as cyclohexanone, acetone, benzene and xylene. Preferred binders are, for example, a cellulose acetate butyrate, a polystyrene, a polysulphonamide, a polycarbonate e.g. Lexan , a cellulose nitrate, hydroabietyl alcohol sold by the Hercules Chemical Co. asAbitol AUK 257 , a poly ethyl methacrylate , a poly vinyl butyral , or a combination thereof. A dye is chosen for its compatibility with the binder of choice and for its high absorpti vity at the wavelength of the recording beam of choice. Innumerable dyes are available and well known. When the recording beam is to be one produced by an argon ion laser wavelength 488 nm , suitable dyes include but are not limited to Iosol Red absorption factor at 488 nm 40 Eastone Red R available fromEastman Kodak Company having the structural formula EMI11.1 absorption factor at 488 nm of 74.2 and Eastone Red B available from Eastman Kazak Company having the structural formula EMI12.1 absorption factor at 488 am of 79.5 Sudan IV, having the structural formula EMI12.2 absorption factor at 488 nm of 66 1 2 pyridylazo 2 napthol, having the structural formula EMI12.3 absorption factor at 488 nm of 62 SKi having the structural formula EMI12.4 having an absorption factor at 488 nm of 128 and SK2 having the structural formula EMI12.5 having an absorption factor of 123.The preparation and utility of coumarin compounds such as SKI and SK2 are described in Research Dis closure11 Publication No. 16167 by Ind. Opp. Ltd. U.K. If the recording medium is to be used as a master record for producing replicate records, it is useful in some embodiments to incorporate into the amorphous material an additional dye having high absorbency at a wavelength of radiation useful for recording upon a replicate recording medium. In such a case the support must be substantially transparent at that wavelength. Another useful method of producing replicates from the recorded medium of the invention is to deposit a metal layer on the deformed surface of the recorded medium by a known technique such as chemical plating or vacuum deposition, and then to strip the metal layer off and use it as a press out replicate recordings much in. the same way as present day replicate phonograph records are produced . Referring again to Fig. 1, the support 20 may be rigid or flexible and transparent or reflective, depending upon the way it is to be used. The support may comprise any of a virtually unlimited number of materials, for example, glass plate, glass plate coated with 50 nm 500A thick reflective layer of aluminium, a resin film or plate such as polyethylene terephthalate or cellulose acetate, paper, clay, wood, or metal. Important characteristics of the support are that it have a relatively high melting point to avoid deformation during recording a very smooth surface to minimize noise and that it be capable of being solvent coated with a layer of amorphous material less than 0.45 micron thick, with good adhesion and no significant chemical reactivity between the layer and the support. The recording medium of the present invention is suitable for making a high quality recording by thermally deforming the medium with a recording beam, such as a laser beam, that is pulse encoded with the information being recorded. There is usually continuous relative motion between the surface of the recording layer and the recording beam. The rate of this relative motion scanning speed may vary, and the recording beam may. have varying power and diameter.The peak power delivered to the surface of the recording layer is from 2 to 10 milliwatts in the examples provided below but is not limited to that range. The beam diameter may also vary widely, being about 0.75 micron or less in the examples, but it may be larger, depending on the size of the deformation desired. The scanning speed may also vary.In the examples, the scanning speeds used resulted in 45 to 55 nanosecond exposures per recorded bit of information. The information may be read back by use of the recording beam, with its power, of course, reduced sufficiently so as not to cause any further thermal deformation. With a recording medium of the invention, however, the reading beam need not have a wavelength that is absorbed to any extent by the amorphous layer of material because reading depends not on absorbance but on the radiationscattering effects of the surface deformations.Schlieren optics may be used advantageously during reading but are not required. The reading beam cooperates with a photodetector which detects the sizes of and spacings between deformations by lay of their radiation scattering effects. In some embodiments of the invention, as previously mentioned, the recorded information can be erased by leating the whole surface of the recorded medium with a hot air stream until surface tension smooths out the surface or by following techniques such as those described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,475,760. The medium can then be recorded upon again. This cycle may be repeated a large number of times, depending upon whether any significant portion of the amorphous material has been lost because of vapourizatxn or burning during recording.A recording medium having a recording layer less than 0.45 micron thick, comprising a 3 to 1 mixture of Iosol Red and cellulose nitrate, is a good example of a recording medium that is erasable and rerecordable. The following examples are provided to further illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention Example 1 1.0 g of the dye SK1 defined previously was mixed with 1.0 g of cellulose nitrate. The mixture was dissolved in 120 g of cyclohexanone, filtered through a filter having a pore size of 0.45 micron and whirl coated at 200 RPM onto a circular glass plate having a diameter of about30.5 cms 12 inches , a thickness of about 0.64 cm 1 4 inch , and a 50 nm 500A thick layer of aluminium on the surface being coated. The resultant dried layer of amorphous material had a thickness of approximately 0.16 micron and an absorption factor of 64 at 488 nanometers. Information from a colour video signal was recorded upon this medium using an argon ion laser wavelength 488 nm having a beam diameter of about 0.7 micron. Each discrete bit of information was recorded as a deformation consisting of a depression surrounded by sharply defined ridges.The information was read back using a helium neon laser wavelength 633 nm , and yielded a signal having a signal to noise ratio of 52 decibels with few imperfections or dropouts.Example 2 0.5 g of the dye SK1 was mixed with 1.0 g of cellulose nitrate. The mixture was dissolved in 60 g of cyclohexanone, filtered through a filter having a pore size of 0.45 micron, and whirl coated at 400 RPM onto an aluminized glass plate as inExample 1, to a thickness of about 0.16 micron and an absorption factor at 488 nm of 43. Information from a odour video signal was recorded upon this medium using an argon ion laser.Each discrete bit of information was recorded as a deformation having a size smaller than 1.5 microns consisting of a depression surrounded by sharply defined ridges. The information was read back using a helium neon laser, and yielded a signal tonoise ratio of 54 decibels with few imperfections or dropouts.Example 3 3.0 g of Iosol Red dye was mixed with 1.0 g of cellulose nitrate, dissolved in 80 g of cyclohexanone, filtered to 0.45 micron absolute, and whirl coated, at 1050 RPM onto an aluminized glass plate as in Example 1, to a thickness of about 0.16 micron and an absorption factor at 488 nm of 30. Colour video signal information was recorded upon this medium using an argon ion laser. Each discrete bit of information was recorded as a deformation consisting of a depression surrounded by sharply defined ridges. The information was read back using a helium neon laser, and yielded a signal to noise ratio of 48 vdb with few imperfections or dropouts. This recording was erased with heat and re recorded, the cycle being repeated three times with equal performance.Example 4 1.0 g of the dye SKI was mixed with 1.0 g of Abitol AWÇ 257, dissolved in 50 g of cyclohexanone, and whirl coated as in Example 3. The layer had an absorption factor of 54. Colour video signal information was recorded upon this medium using an argon ion laser. Each discrete bit of information was recorded as a deformation consisting of a depression surrounded by sharply defined ridges. The information was read back using a helium neon laser, and yielded a signal to noise ratio of 48 db with few imperfections or dropouts. This recording was erased with heat and re recorded with good performance.Example 5 A number of amorphous materials were prepared, coated, and recorded upon as in the previous examples. Recording power ranged from about 2 to 10 milliwatts at a beam diameter of about 0.7 micron.The specific materials and their performances are listed in Table I. All of these materials were chosen for their capability of being thermally deformed to form depressions surrounded by sharply defined ridges.

These experiments are reported in the following comparative examples.Comparative Example 1 h coating composition according toExample 1 of Belgian Patent No. 858,636 was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of Solvent Red 1 dye in 10 ml of a 10 percent weight g per volume ml solution of PARLON 300 Cp in l,l,2 trichloroethylene. This coating composition was 2 by weight of dye with respect to the thermoplastic polymer. It was whirlcoated onto a 30.5 cms 12 inch diameter aluminized glass plate and dried at 250C to obtain a recording medium having a specular optical density of 0.37. The absorption factor of the coating at 488 nm was only 3. It was not possible to record a color video signal on this medium using the recording procedure described in Example 5, above. This experiment shows that the recording material according to this invention must have an absorption factor, as hereinbefore defined, of 20 or greater to produce a satisfactory, high quality recording.Comparative Example 2 A coating composition was prepared by dissolving 0.1 gram of the dye SKI in 10 ml of a 9 by weight solution PARLON 300 Cp in cyclohexanone. This is the maximum permissible ratio of dye to polymer according to Belgian Patent No.858,636. This solution was whirl coated onto a 30.5 cms. 12 inch diameter, aluminized glass plate to give a specular density of 0.88. The absorption factor of the recording layer was 13 at 488 nm. It was attempted to record a colour video signal on this medium using the procedure described in Example 5. On microscopic examination it was noted that slight deformations had been formed in the recording layer but it was impossible to obtain a picture on playback. This experiment shows that employing a useful dye see Examples 1,2,4 and 5 at only 10 by weight based on the thermoplastic polymer results in a recording layer having a low absorption factor which is not satisfactory for the purposes of this invention.Comparative Example 3 A coating composition was prepared by dissolving 0.1 gram of the dye SKI and 1 g of cellulose nitrate in 100 g of cyclohexanone. The solution was filtered as in Example 1 and whirlcoated on a 30.5 cms 12 inch aluminized glass disc at a specular density of 0.88. The absorption factor of the recording layer was 13 at 488 nm and the layer thickness was 0.75 micron. It was not possible to record a colour video signal on this medium using the recording procedure described in Example 5. A second recording material was prepared with this coating composition at a thickness of 0.15 micron. This medium had a specular density of 0.18 and was not capable of recording a colour video signal by the procedure described in Example 5.This experiment shows that an absorption factor of 20 or greater is necessary for a satisfactory recording medium of this invention.
