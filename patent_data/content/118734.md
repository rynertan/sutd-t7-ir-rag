# Earphone characteristic measuring device.

## Abstract
An earphone characteristic measuring device comprises an acoustic coupler 3, 5 having an acoustic tube 3 simulated to an external auditory canal in which an earphone under measurement is to be inserted and an acoustic tube 5 of a smaller diameter having an acoustic impedance of approximately 320 ohms connected to an end of the first acoustic tube 3 , a sound source 109 for emitting an impulse sound to the acoustic coupler, a microphone 2 mounted at the end of the first acoustic tube for picking up sound pressure information and a characteristic calculation circuit 108, 110 for transforming an earphone characteristic of the acoustic coupler to an earphone characteristic of a real ear based on an input impedance of the acoustic coupler looked from an end of a pinna of the earphone inserted in the acoustic coupler and an input impedance of the real ear corresponding to a sum of an eardrum impedance of the real ear and an external auditory canal volume, stored in a memory 104, 106 in response to the sound pressure information from the microphone. The use of the acoustic coupler of a simple structure facilitates the measurement of a vent characteristic of the earphone and an insertion gain and improves reliability of the measurement.
