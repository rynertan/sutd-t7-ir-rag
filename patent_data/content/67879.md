# NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED MACHINING SYSTEM.

## Abstract
A numerically controlled machining system, which en ables rough machining using command data for finishing. A clamping means clamps a pre designated driving shaft onto clamp coordinates. When executing the finishing command data recorded in a numerical information recording medium if the driving axis exceeds the previous set clamp coordin ates this driving axis is clamped by those coordinates. The clamp coordinates are changed sequentially by a clamp coordinates changing means, so that many ways of rough machining can be performed by use of the command data for finishing.

## Description
SPECIFICATION NUMERICAL CONTROLLED MACHINING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a numerical controlled machining system which permits rough machining through utilization of finishing command data TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND Numerical controlled machining is advantageous in that it permits high precision machining without a skilled worker, but it is disadvantageous in that the preparation of command data therefor requires much time and some experience. For instance, in the case of rough machining of a square shaped raw material, it is necessary in the prior art to prepare several kinds of data for rough machining and to rough the raw material to a shape close to a finishing shape by executing the data in a sequential order namely, the prior art involves troublesome preparating of several kinds of command data. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention is intended to overcome such a defect of the prior art and has for its object to make it possible to perform rough machining through utilization of data on at least a machining route in finishing command data, thereby making unnecessary the preparation of command data for rough machining.Briefly stated, the present invention is provided with clamp means for clamping a predesignated drive shaft at a clamp coordinate value when the drive shaft is to exceed the clamp coordinate value in the case of executing finishing command data stored on a numerical information storage medium, The clamp coordinate value is modified by clamp coordinate value modifying means, for instance, upon each completion of rough machining, and a number of rough machining operations are carried out using one finishing command data. Since preparation of rough machining command data can be omitted, maneuverability of the numerical controller can be enhanced markedly. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of an example of a numerical controller embodying this invention system Fig. 2 is a diagram explanatory of its operation Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of another example of the numerical controller embodying this invention system and Figs. 4 and 5 are diagrams explanatory of their operation. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of an example of a numerical controller embodying the system of the present invention. Reference numeral 1 indicates a numerical information storage medium, for instance, a command tape, 2 a decoder, 3 a pulse distribution circuit, 4X, 4Y and 4Z X axis, Y axis and Z axis servo units, 5X, SY and 5Z X axis,Y axis and Z axis motors, 6 a clamp data generator, 7 a current value counter, 8 a clamp coordinate value register, 9 a comparator, 10 a gate circuit, and 11 a keyboard. For example, in the case of sequentially roughing a cubicshaped raw material 20 to finally obtain a product 21 of such a shape as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 2, finishing command data designating a finish machining route indicated by Aw C C D E b A in Fig. 2 is stored on the command tape 1.The command tape 1 is decoded by the decoder 2 and data for pulse distribution are provided to the pulse distribution circuit 3, wherein a predetermined interpolating operation is effected to supply distribution pulses xp, yp and zp to the servo units 4X, 4Y and 4Z of the respective axes, driving the servomotorsSX, SY and SZ. The distribution pulses zp which are applied to theZ axis servo unit 4Z are integrated by the counter 7 to detect the current position of the Z axis motor SZ. The comparator 9 compares the content of the current value counter 7 and the content of the clamp coordinate value register 8 to detect the period for which the position of the Z axis motor SZ exceeds a clamp coordinate value set in the register 8, and turns OFF the gate circuit 10 for that period, inhibiting the input of the distribution pulses to the Z axis servomotor.Accordingly, for instance, in the case where a clamp value indicated by a broken line CL1 in Fig. 2 is set in the clamp coordinate value register 8, the distribution pulses zp are not supplied to the Z axis servo unit 4Z below the set clamp coordinate value, so that although the finishing command data are being processed in the pulse distribution circuit 3, the actual movement of the servomotor is along the machining route A B1 C1 D E b A inFig. 2. That is, rough machining takes place. The clamp data generator 9 is to sequentially modify the clamp coordinate value of the register 8 and a command, such as the rate at which the coordinate value is changed, is provided from the command tape 1 or the keyboard 11. Accordingly, for example, in the case of executing the finishing command data while changing the clamp value in the order CL1 to CL7 in Fig. 2, it is possible to perform rough machining with the clamp value modified sequentially in the order CL1 to CL7. While in the above embodiment the Z axis is clamped, it is also possible, of course, to carry out rough machining, clamping other axes, such as the X axis and the Y axis. Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of another example of the numerical controller embodying the present invention system, the same reference numerals being used as those in connection with Fig. 1, where the parts are the same. Reference numeral 30 indicates a clamp cutting control circuit. According to the method of the foregoing embodiment, when a predesignated shaft exceeds a clamp coordinate value during execution of the finishing command data, the supply of the distribution pulses to the shaft is stopped to thereby permit the clamp operation.In contrast thereto, according to the method of this embodiemnt, the finishing command data is subjected to arithmetic processing in the clamp cutting control circuit 30 to obtain rough machining command blocks, which are provided to the pulse distribution circuit 3, thereby allowing the clamp operation at the clamp coordinate value designated by the register 6. That is to say, the finishing command data stored on the command tape 1 is composed of, for instance, five command blocks r Ply2 P2P3 P3P4, P4 P5 and PSPs as indicated by the sclid line in Fig. 4. In the case where the clamp coordinate value is set at a position Dn, the clamp cutting control circuit 30 reads out the command blocks in a sequential order and decides the positional relationship of start and end points Zst and Zend of each command block to the clamp coordinate value Dn. And when the start and the end point both lie above the clamp GE coordinate value Dn corresponding to the command blocks P 1P2 andP5P6 , the clamp cutting control circuit produces a move command from the start point to the end point, and when the start point is above the clamp coordinate value Dn but the end point is under it corresponding to the command block Pup3 , the clamp cutting control circuit calculates the intersection of a commanded figure with Z Dn and produce a move command from the start point to the intersection.When the start point is under the clamp coordinate value Dn but the end point is above it corresponding r to the command block P4P5 , the intersection of the commanded figure with Z Dn is calculated and a move command from a current point corresponding to a point P2P3 to the intersection and a move command from the intersection to the end point are both produced and when the start and the end point both lie under the clamp coordinate value Dn, this command block is invalidated.Fig. 5 is a flowchart representation of the abovesaid arithmetic processing operation of the clamp cutting control circuit 30 so as to facilitate a better understanding of the operation. Such processing is implemented using the arithmetic operation function of a processor in practice. According to such a system of this embodiment, the finishing command data is subjected to arithmetic processing by the clamp cutting control circuit 30 to produce rough machining command data for input to the pulse distribution circuit 3, so that this method has the advantage of higher cutting efficiency than in the case of the method of the foregoing embodiment.Furthermore, if all command blocks necessary for one rough machining are prestored in a memory or the like, the memory capacity increases, so that it is preferred te calculate the rough machining blocks on line with cutting control, thereby to minimize the number of rough machining command blocks which are stored. As has been described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, since rough machining can be carried out using finishing command data, there is no need of preparing several kinds of rough machining command data in advance unlike in the prior art, providing the advantage of markedly improved maneuverability of the numerical controller. Incidentally, the present invention is not limited specifically to the foregoing embodiments but various other modifications and additions can be effected. For example, it is optional to control the feed rate of a tool by storing the tool feed rate in a predetermined section in each rough machning, or by manually entering it from the keyboard.
