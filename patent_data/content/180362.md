# Supported organometallic compounds for utilization in purification of fluids.

## Abstract
Supported organometallic compounds of Groups II, III and IV of the Periodic Table are utilized for purifying fluids particu larly hydrocarbon fluids, noble gases, nitrogen and hydrogen and desirable hydrocarbon solvents and olefins to remove im purities such as oxygen, sulfur, halogen containing com pounds, active hydrogen compounds and other polar com pounds. The supported organometallic compounds preferably supported metal alkyls, are prepared by reacting the pretreated dried solid support material with the organometallic com pounds in such a manner as to effect loading or impregnation of the organometallic moieties onto the support.
