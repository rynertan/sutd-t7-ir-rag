# Stepper motor load tuning.

## Abstract
A method is provided for adjusting to an original predetermined value the natural frequency of the carrier load 27 of a microprocessor 55 controlled stepper motor 33 driving said carrier through a belt 35 and pulley 34, 34a arrangement. The adjustement is performed by having the microprocessor move said carrier back and forth repetitively, at a rate based on the original natural frequency value and by adjusting 71 the belt tension for obtaining maximum amplitude vibrations of the carrier load.
