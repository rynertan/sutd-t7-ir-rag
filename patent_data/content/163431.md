# Texture equilibration in cookies.

## Abstract
A process for reducing the time required to achieve texture equilibration in crumb continuous cookies having distributed therein discrete regions of storage stable crisp texture and discrete regions of storage stable chewy texture comprises increasing the rate of sugar crystallization. The rate of sugar crystallization can be increased by exposing the cookies to an exogenous source of moisture, decreasing the level of crystallization resistant sugar in the outer region of the cookie, decreasing readily crystallizable sugar particle size for a given sugar level, increasing the readily crystalliz able sugar to flour ratio, increasing the moisture level in the cookie dough, baking the cookies to have a higher moisture content, or by any combination of these or other equivalent means.
