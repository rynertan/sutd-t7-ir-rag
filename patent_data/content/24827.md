# A method of producing light gauge metallic strip material.

## Abstract
A method of producing a coil of light gauge metallic strip material is disclosed comprising the steps of compressing a metal powder mixture into a cylindrical billet having homogeneous structure, grain size and chemical composi tion, rotating the billet about its longitudinal axis, and peeling a continuous light gauge layer from the exterior surface of the rotating billet by advancing a cutting edge of a cutting tool into subsurface contact with the rotating billet along the full longitudinal extent of the billet.
