# METAL BAR FEED CONTROL DEVICE FOR THE FEEDING OF AN AUTOMATIC MULTIPLE SPINDLE LATHE

## Abstract
The object of this invention is a device created to control the simultaneous or sequential feeding of metal bars in a guide equipment in order to feed an automatic multiple spindle lathe. The device consists basically of a series of drive shafts 21 , each of which accounts for the feeding of a bar. These shafts amount to the same number as the lathe spindles and are placed in a drum 7 that rotates synchronously with the lathe spindle holding drum. Each of these shafts 21 can be coupled with contrivances 1 that can make it turn, when a certain length of bar is to be fed. This coupling can take place thanks to engaging and disengaging parts 49 mounted bet ween every shaft 21 and its rotation control contrivances 1 . Each shaft 21 controls at least one gear 36 accounting for the feeding of a bar, through a chain or the like provided with a bar pusher, when the shaft is made to turn. This gear 36 can be moved so as to make it possible to adjust and to use the device, whatever the spindle centre distance regarding the multiple spindle lathe concerned may be.
