# Bottle carrier.

## Abstract
A bottle carrier P which holds several bottles R by the neck and middle, separately and independently of each other, comprises a supporting framework 10 with finger openings 24, 26 for handling the bottle carrier P with ease. A group of first rings 12 associated with said framework 10 independently hold each bottle R at the middle, and a group of second rings 14 of a smaller diameter hold the neck of each bottle R . Holding bars 16 interconnect each first ring 12 with a corresponding second ring 14 to form rigid structures which firmly hold the bottles inside the carrier P , independently of each other. The second rings 14 include a series of upwardly projecting flexible projec tions 18 in order to grip the bottle necks.
