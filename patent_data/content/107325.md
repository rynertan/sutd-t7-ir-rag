## Description
METHOD OF MAKING OXIDE FILMS This invention relates to the fabrication of thin film oxides. While oxide films can be grown using electron beam heating of the oxide source, the dissociation of the oxide results in a high background pressure of O2 in the chamber. Moreover, when an element is evaporated in an oxygen ambient, a very high 02 background pressure or very slow growth rate is necessary to form an oxide because of the short residence time of 02 on the growth surface. Another approach to growth of an oxide e.g., Al203 employs a Molecular Beam Epitaxy MBE chamber to evaporate the metal e.g., Al in a background of about 10 5 5 Torr of 02. However, there are several difficulties associated with this approach. First, the high 02 background will oxidize the hot filaments of the effusion cells, ion gauges, etc. as well as the evaporation charges. Secondly, the 02 will react with the hot elements in the chamber to form high levels ofCO and CO2, which could lead to undesirable carbon incorporation into the films. Finally, the kinetics of the reaction of Al with O2 are slow enough that the growth rate must be very slow or the 02 pressure very high so that the Al will fully oxidize. For example, R.W.Grant et al attempted to grow Al2O3 in an ambient of 10 4 4 Torr of O, by evaporating Al at a rate of 1 A sec at a growth temperature of 25 0C. They reported inAFWAL TR 80 1104, p. 25 1980 that a metallic Al layer resulted with no obvious difference from Al deposited under UHV conditions with no 02 ambient . According to the present invention there is provided a method of fabricating an oxide film RmOn, where R is at least one metal or at least one semiconductor, or combination thereof, and m and n are integers, comprising a mounting a substrate in a chamber, b providing in the chamber a solid oxygen source, which does not contain R, c providing a source of R in the chamber, and d heating the sources to evaporation, the evaporants reacting to form the oxide film RmOn on the substrate. Embodiments of the present invention enable oxide ROn thin films to be grown without an 02 ambient by using a second oxide as the oxygen source. Fro separate effusion cells, at least one metal and or semiconductor R and an oxide MrOs, the oxygen source, are evaporated onto a substrate in a chamber. When R O is thermodynamically more stable i.e., has a lower Gibbs free energy than MrOs, the following reaction takes place mR M O R O M O 1 where r, s, m, and n are integers. When MrO n is volatile at the growth temperature, an oxide film ofRmOn results.This growth technique avoids the difficulties associated with backfilling the chamber with 02. Using a MBE system, MrOs can be chosen to have a relatively low vapor pressure so that it will stick to the walls of the MBE chamber and its cryopanels. Thus, the heating filaments that are not in line of sight of theMrOs effusion cell are protected from oxidation, and the background pressures of CO, 02, CO2, etc. are kept lowFinally, the residence time of M O on the surface is long compared to 02. This property greatly decreases the flux of MrOS compared with 2 necessary for growth of the oxides. The invention can be readily understood from the following, more detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which the sole figure is a sputter Auger profile of an Al2O3 film grown on GaAs at 3500C, In the following examples, materials, temperatures, pressures, and other operating conditions are provided by way of illustration only. The growth of oxide thin films described herein was performed in a MBE apparatus of the type generally described by A.Y. Cho et al in Progress in Solid State Chemistry, Vol. 10, Part 3, pp. 157 191, PergamonPress 1975 . Extensive liquid nitrogen cryopanels were used in the belljar chamber although not around the effusion cells. Polished, Si doped, 100 oriented, n GaAs substrates were cleaned in organic solvents and frev etched in hot H2SO4 H202 H20 7 1 1 . The substrates were mounted using In as a solder on molybdenum block and loaded directly into the growth chamber. The system was pumped down to 10 6 Torr before flowing liquid nitrogen in the cryopanels, which reduced the pressure to the high 10 8 Torr range. After outgassing the effusion cells for about 45 minutes at or above operating temperature, the substrate was heated to about 60000 for five minutes to desorb any native oxide on the GaAs substrate, and then the temperature was set to that desired for growth. The cell containing MrOS was heated to yield a beam suitable for growth.For example, the cell containing Sub 203 was held at 380 0C yielding a beam equivalent pressure in the mid 10 7 Torr at the substrate for the films grown at about 0.2 Sm hr., whereas the cell containing As203 was held at 1000C yielding a beam equivalent in the mid 10 Torr range for films grown at about 3 Wm hr. The beam fluxes were also observed using a UTI Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer QMS with 0 400 AMU range. The growth surface crystallinity was monitored using 8 keV Reflection Electron Diffraction RED . A number of oxides were tried as the oxygen source, MrO As mentioned previously, this oxide should sublime congruently i.e., it should not decompose into unbonded 0 atoms or 02 molecules. This decomposition was studied by subliming the oxides in effusion cells in line of sight of the QMS. Two oxides were found to be unsuitable PbO and Bi 203 both decomposed as evidenced by the low ratio of the PbO Pb and BiO Bi peaks from the cracking patterns of the QMS. Also, when the line oi sight path between the heated effusion cell and the ion gauge was blocked with a shutter, the readings did not change, thereby indicating that the oxide had decomposed producing a high oxygen background.On the other hand, both Sub 203 and As 203 were found to be suitable oxygen sources both sublimed congruently as evidenced by the high ratio about 10 1 of theSbO Sb and AsO As peaks from the cracking patterns of the QMS. However, Sb203 was chosen over As 203 as the oxygen source for growth of most of the oxide thin films described below only because of its lower vapor pressure 10 2 Torr for Sb203 as compared with 102 Torr for As205 at 4000C . When the line of sight path between the heated Sb203 cell and the QMS was shuttered, the SbO peak dropped by a factor 10 4 within a few seconds. For other applications, possibly room temperature growth, the higher vapor pressure As 203 might be preferred. The results using the inventive growth technique are summarized in Table I. The oxide nature of the films was readily apparent after growth from the interference colors as well as the high resistivity, hardness, and chemical etching characteristics. The thickness and refractive index of the films were determined using ellipsometry. Further evidence of the oxide nature was provided by Auger Electron Spectroscopy AES and X RayPhotoelectron Spectroscopy XPS . The shift in energy of the Mg, Al, and Si peaks from the elemental peaks indicates that the atoms are bonded to oxygen. Also AES and XPS reveal that low levels of Sb 5 atomic are incorporated into the films. The higher values of index of refraction n correlate with lower oxygen content of the films.Note the deviations of n for some of these films from the stoichiometric values 1.65, 1.74, and 1.45 for A1203, MgO and SiO2, respectively . XPS atomic concentration results are summarized in Table II. The high level of carbon incorporation probably results from the high backgroundCO levels in the chamber and should be lower in a cleaner system. Al2O3 films were grown with both As203 and Sb203 as the oxygen source. Films 1 3 were grown at the highest growth rate of 3 m hr. at 6000C while the other fills were grown at 0.2 Wm hr. Growths at temperatures from 3500C to 7500C were successful, but growth at room temperature failed because the Sub 203 did not evaporate from the growth surface. However, theory indicates that use of a higher vapor pressure oxygen source will enable room temperature growth. The resistivity and breakdown field of Film 2 were greater than 1013 cm and 2 x 10 6V cm. For Film 5, grown at 350 C, sputter Auger measurements indicated a transition width of about 150 2 at the A1203 GaAs interface as shown in the Figure.A much higher transition width of about 900 resulted for much growth at 750 C for Film 6. In addition to Al2O3, films of MgO, SiO2, and thespinel MgO Al2O3 MgAl204 were also grown. All MgO films had a rough morphology while the other films had a smooth surface as viewed on a Nomarski interference contrast microscope. No evidence of pinholing was found after placing the samples in a GaAs etch, Ni130H H202 H20 1 1 3 , for 15 minutes. All films were able to pass an adherence test using adhesive tape. While all Al2O3 and SiO2 films were amorphous, all MgO and MgO Al2O3 films were polycrystalline with increasing orientation at higher growth temperatures. Similar to the work of R.W. Grant et al, supra, Al was evaporated in an ambient of 10 5 Torr with the Al flux and growth temperature identical to that used forSample 5. Instead of an oxide film such as Sample 5, a metallic film resulted in spite of the fact that the 02 Al flux ratio 100 was much higher than the antimony oxide Al flux ratio 2 . Of course, thermodynamics indicates that Al will oxidize at 3500C in 10 5 5 Torr of 02. However, for the oxide growth attempts in 10 5 Torr of O . the kinetics of the reaction of Al with 02 are the limiting factor i.e., the surface residence time ofO2 is short compared to the time needed for Al and 02 to react. Thus, when using the Grant et al technique, either high 02 pressures or slow growth rates are necessary to form the Al203 layers.Because of the lower vapor pressure of Sb2O3 and As203, the surface residence time of these oxides is much longer than for 02. The kinetics of the reaction of Al with Sb2O3 and As203 did not appreciably limit the oxidation of Al even at a growth rate of 3 im hr. Evidence of this effect is given by the low index of refraction, which indicates high oxygen ncorporation, of Sample 1. Sample 3, also grown at 3 m hr., had a high index of refraction see Table I and a correspondingly low oxygen incorporation see Table II .However, the low oxygen level was presumably due to the low Sb203 Alflux ratio used for this sample about 0.2 of the flux ratio used for other samples . However, in spite of the lower flux ratio, Sample 3 had more than twice the antimony concentration of the samples grown at 0.2 Cun hr, Thus, the desorption of the SbrOS n before burial will probably limit the growth rate of Awl 203 before the kinetics of the reaction of Al with Sb203. Sample 1, grown at a 3 m hr., but with a much higher flux ratio of As203 Al than the flux ratio ofSb203 Al of Sample 3, had a much lower Group V concentration 1 As vs. 5 Sb because of the higher vapor pressure of the As 203. Also the kinetics of the reaction of Al with Sb2O3 are expected to be slower than with the less stable As2O3. It is to be understood that the above described arrangements are merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments which can be devised to represent application of the principles of the invention Numerous and varied other arrangements can be devised in accordance with these principles by those skilled in the art. In particular, while most of the films described above were binary oxides, growth of mixed oxides such asMgO A1203 Sample 11 was straightforward. The technique is also applicable to the growth of many ternary oxide films which are of importance as display materials e.g., Y3Al5012 and as electrooptic materials e.g., Lint03 . In addition, while the above experiments utilized aGaAs substrate, other substrates are also suitable, e.g., other Group III V compounds, such as InP elemental semiconductors such as Si metals such as Al and dielectrics such as sapphire. Moreover, the oxygen source is not limited to the Group V oxides described. It is expected that oxides of Group VI elements such asS, Se, and Te would also be appropriate. While none of the oxide films grown were single crystals, the MgO and Mg0 Al 203 films, which both have a face centered cubic structure with about 5 lattice mismatch to GaAs, were polycrystalline. All Awl 203 and 5102 films, which have a much greater mismatch to GaAs, were amorphous. Thus, better crystallinity is expected for oxide films that lattice match the substrate. A MBE apparatus is particularly useful for growth of these oxide films. The same thickness uniformity and control that MBE provides for semiconductors and metals is obtainable for the oxide films. Growth of metal oxide and semiconductor oxide layered structures is possible by control of the oxygen source effusion cell shutter. Nevertheless, for other applications a MBE system may not be necessary. For example, a system designed for inert gas flow through the chamber may be suitable, but in general a high vacuum system with the capability of separately heated sources and a heated substrate is preferred.
