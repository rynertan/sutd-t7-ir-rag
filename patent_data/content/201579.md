## Description
The present invention relates to preparations to increase the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria containing an adhesive promoting protein as defined in the claims. The invention will be described and is applicable for both animals and humans. Animals here relates to domestic animals such as pigs, calves and poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. At present the mortality rate amongst the above mentioned animals is high, and is caused by the establishment and colonisation of pathogenic bacteria in the stomach and intestines. Pathogenic bacteria out compete the normal bacteria flora, adhere to the wall of the intestines and give rise to symptoms of disease such as diarrhoea, and results in increased mortality. The losses in some herds or flocks are considerable as a result of outbreaks of pathogenic bacteria as Numerous attempts are currently being made to introduce nonpathogenic bacteria into the gastro intestinal tract in order to prevent or remove colonisation of pathogenic bacteria. Oral administration of different types of bacillus to humans has been found to reduce the risk of cancer in the large intestine and increase the removal or ousting of intestinal pathogens as well as being of therapeutic value of elderly patients.Equivalent studies of animals and humans have the common factor that bacteria introduced in the gastro intestinal tract in order to improve the state of health and increase survival in the host organism. Colonisation of these bacteria is possible provided the bacteria cells are capable of attaching themselves to the epithelium walls of the host organism. An almost continuous supply of large bacteria cultures is required to achieve the above results, which makes the method impractical. Most studies of the above type have been carried out on animals and show negative results with respect to adhesion and colonisation of the specific type of bacteria used. Existing methods have the following problems,which also prevent successful experiments Some examples illustrate these limitations In humans From CH A 637 297, DE A 2010654, DE A 2738652, EP A 33584 and Rote Liste, Aulendorf 1984 , nrs 59371, 59372, 59374, 59375, 59376 and 59377 a number of bacteria or specifically lactic acid bacteria cultivation techniques and preparations containing those genera and their products are described. However, none of these documents discloses an elevated addition of glucose, lactose or sucrose to the common cultivation medium. In research into the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria e.g. the genera Lactobacillus and Streptococcus to the gastro intestinal tract in laboratory animals it was found contrary to accepted belief, that the specific binding of the bacteria to epithelial cells in the host organism, is not mediated by polysaccharides, but rather by a protein. The following points constitute the bases of the process on which the present invention is founded The invention is illustrated further with reference to the following non limiting examples, relating to experiments with animals. The cultivation conditions, relating to harvesting and adhesion capacity of lactic acid bacteria were investigated. The adhesion was determined by an in vitro adhesion system using bacteria free portions of the gastro intestinal tract of mice or pigs. The extent of binding of the bacterial cells was determined using both the radioactive isotop labeling method as well as light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Adhesion decreases markedly with subcultering especially in normally used media for culturing lactic acid bacteria. The addition of elevated levels of saccharides enhanced adhesion by a factor of 3. Brain heart infusion media normally contains 0.2 glucose. The bacterial cells show no adhesion after having been subcultured in complex nutrient On the other hand a defined casamino acid CAS medium with the addition of 2 sucrose resulted in lactic acid bacteria having excellent adhesion capacity to the epithelial cells in the gastro intestinal tract, see the Table. Other types of sugar, e.g. glucose and lactose, may be used as well as sucrose. Other amino acid compositions different from the casamino acid may also be used. Bacterial cells cultured in a complex medium could adhere if processsed to preserve APP with cells. This is further illustrated in example 2. The use of the CAS medium with enhanced levels of saccharides enabled a proteinaceous compound APP which promotes adhesion produced by the lactic acid bacteria to be harvested in the supernatant after cultivation. Several proteinaceous molecules are released from the bacterial cells during growth in CAS medium with enhanced levels of saccharides. Proteine fractionation of culture supernatant from lactic acid bacteria grown in CAS medium, has shown that APP can be identified and isolated. Once identified this APP was also detected when lactic acid bacteria were cultured in a complex brain heart infusion BHI broth. The molecular weight of APP has been determined to approximately 14000 using a FPLG system by Pharmacia. Bacteria which cannot adhere to the gastro intestinal tract are, however, able to adhere in the presence of this APP. Besides which, a four fold increase is obtained in adhesion of bacteria already possessing an ability to bind, when the APP is added. This APP has been demonstrated using hostspecific strains of lactic acid bacteria e.g. the genera Lactobacillus and Streptococcus for tissue from the gastro intestinal tract from both mouse and pig.
