# Lightning arrester with leakage current detection.

## Abstract
A lightning arrester comprises nonlinear resistance discs 2 stacked within a ceramic casing 1, with annular me tal cover rings 3, 4 being fixed to the opposite outer ends of the casing. Conductive plates 5, 19 having reduced thick ness rupturable portions are sealed to the ends of the cas ing, with the lower plate 19 being insulated from the lower ring 4 by an insulating ring 20. An ammeter 16 is connected between the conductive plate 19 and ground by a lead wire 21 passing through the ring skirt but insulated therefrom, whereby only leakage current passing through the nonli near resistance discs is sensed.
