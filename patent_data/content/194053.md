# Printed circuit board keying system.

## Abstract
Incorrect pairing of subsidiary printed circuit boards 100a, 100b on opposite sides of a main circuit board 10 is prevented by providing a shaped key or insert 150a, 150b on each subsidiary circuit board 100a, 100b . The inserts 150a, 150b are arranged to mate within an aperture in the main board 10 only when the inserts are complementary in shape and orientation.
