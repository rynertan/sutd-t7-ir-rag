## Description
Curable resin composition BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a curable resin composition.More particularly, the present invention relates to a curable resin composition which can be cured by photoirradiation and heating to give a cured product having excellent electrical characteristics, solder heat resistance, humidity resistance, adhesiveness, etc., which is very useful, for example, for solder resist of printed wiring plate, etc.In recent years, in the field of electrical or electronic instruments, as the wiring circuit is made higher in density or highly integrated, the electrical insulating materials, paints, resist materials have been strongly desired to have excellent electrical characteristics, particularly excellent electrical characteristics at higher temperatures, as well as good adhesiveness with the materials to be coated and good heat resistance of the coated film on the material surface.In the prior art, in printed wiring plates, it has been known to use an imagewise protective film for protection of the circuit and for prevention of solder bridge during soldering of parts hereinafter called solder resist . As the resin for solder resist, epoxy type thermosetting resins, acrylate type and or methacrylate type photocurble resins, etc. have been employed. Among them, epoxy type thermosetting resins are excellent in electrical characteristics, solder heat resistance, humidity resistance, adhesiveness, etc. but they have the drawback that, because of the printing method such as screen printing employed for formation of the image of solder resist, it is inferior in dimensional precision and therefore not applicable for a printed wiring plate with high density minute pattern.On the other hand, acrylate type and or methacrylate type photocurable resins are excellent in workability, since curing can be accomplished within a short time, and it is possible to employ, as the image forming method, the above printing method and the photographic method, namely, in which the photocurable resin laminated on the printed wiring plate is exposed through a nega mask, then developed by removing the unexposed portion with a solvent to form an image corresponding to the nega mask. The photographic method, which is excellent in dimensional precision of the image, is advantageous in production of printed wiring plates with high density minute patterns.However, acrylate type and or methacrylate type photocurable resins cannot necessarily be satisfactory with respect to electrical characteristics, solder heat resistance, humidity resistance, etc.As an improvement of the problems of epoxy type thermosetting resins or acrylate type and or methacrylate type photocurable resins as described above, for example,Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 62636 1983 discloses a composition for solder resist in which an epoxy resin having phososensitive groups capable of forming images by the photographic method is used.However, since this resin is an oligomer having photosensitive groups introduced into the main chain of the molecule, it is limited in solubility in solvents, and not necessarily excellent in workability. For example, there are involved the problems such that it is difficultly soluble in a nonflammable developing solvent for general purpose preferred for ensuring safety during production of printed wiring plates, such as l,l,l tri chloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethane, etc., or that it will take a long time for development due to poor solubility. Thus, this composition cannot be appreciated as satisfactory.Various studies and developments have been progressed in order to obtain resin compositions having good characteristics responding to such demands.Consequently, as such resin compositions, there have been known those comprising partially acrylated and or methacrylated hereinafter abbreviated as meth acrylated epoxy resins obtained by addition reaction of acrylic acid and or methacrylic acid hereinafter abbreviated as meth acrylic acid to an epoxy resin at a ratio not more than equivalent to the epoxy groups in said epoxy resin. Here, the partially meth acrylated epoxy resin was greatly useful as the resin having both the photocurability through acryloyl group and or methacryloy groups hereinafter abbreviated as meth acryloyl groups and the properties of electrical characteristics, heat resistance and adhesiveness imparted by curing of the epoxy groups.Also, the partially meth acrylated epoxy resin, because of having meth acryloyl group and epoxy group in one molecule, is different in properties from the resin composition comprising a mixture of an acrylate resin and or a methacrylate resin with an epoxy resin, and had more excellent photocurability. The partially meth acrylated resin, while having itself good characteristics as mentioned above, suffered from marked lowering in storage stability of the resin or electrical characteristics of the cured product, caused by the residual catalyst in the meth acrylated epoxy resin formed, because a quaternary ammonium salt or a tertiary amine is used as the catalyst in order to progress smoothly the addition reaction during production of the resin.Also, difficulties have been encountered in removal of the residual catalyst, and cumbersome washing steps or separation steps are required in most cases to be disadvantageous also industrial applications. For this reason, even after the catalyst removing operation, a small amount of the catalyst will frequently remain, whereby there is involved the drawback that satisfactory electrical characteristics could not necessarily be obtained.Further, as the method for curing the partially Cmeth acrylated epoxy resin, there have been generally employed the method in which a photopolymerization initiator, a sensitizer or a thermal polymerization initiator is used alone or in combination for polymerization of meth acryloyl groups and the method in which a curing agent or curing catalyst such as an amine type compound, an acid anhydride type compound,Lewis acid type compound, etc. is used for curing of epoxy groups. However, when the resin compositions of the prior art are used as insulating materials, encapsulating resin materials or resist materials for electronic or electrical instrument parts, they involved the drawbacks of having not necessarily satisfactory electrical characteristics or good workability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to cancel the drawbacks as described above, and particularly to provide a curable resin composition which can be cured by photoirradiation and heating and is useful in, for example, solder resist for a printed wiring plate with excellent electrical characteristics, solder heating resistance, adhesiveness and developing characteristic, etc.The curable composition of this invention comprises a at least one of partially acrylated and methacrylated epoxy resins b a sensitizer which can initiate the polymerization of at least one of acryloyl group or methacryloyl group by photoirradiation c a curing catalyst comprising an organic metal compound and an organic silicon compound. In a preferred embodiments, the curable composition may further comprises d a compound having at least one group selected from the group consisting of acryloyl group, methacryloyl group and epoxy group, with proviso that component a is excluded. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONThe partially meth acrylated epoxy resin a may be any one of those known generally as partially meth acrylated epoxy resins. Such partially meth acrylated epoxy resins may be produced, for example, according to the following procedure. In the presence of a tertiary amine such as dimethylbenzyl amine or a quaternary ammonium salt such as chlorinated trimethylbenzylammonium, an epoxy resin is allowed to react with meth acrylic acid at a ratio of meth acrylic acid not more than equivalent to the epoxy groups in the epoxy resin at a temperature of 100 to 110 OC for about less than 10 hours.Among these components a , there may be included a resin obtained by, for example, reacting an epoxy resin with meth acrylic acid at a proportion of meth acrylic acid not more than equivalent to the epoxy groups in the epoxy resin, preferably at an equivalent ratio latter former of 0.1 to 0.9, more preferably at an equivalent ratio latter former of 0.3 to 0.8. Here, in the case of an equivalent ratio less than 0.1, the photocurability of the resultant partially meth acrylated epoxy resin will be inferior, while at an equivalent ratio over 0.9, the cured product of the resin obtained will be inferior in adhesion to the substrate, electrical characteristics, solder heat resistance, etc.Among these components a , particularly when employing the curable composition of this invention for solder resist of the printed wiring plate, it is preferred to use a resin obtained by the addition reaction between an epoxy resin having two epoxy groups in the molecular with an average molecular weight of 150 to 1500 and meth acrylic acid as described above. If the average molecular weight in the epoxy resin is less than 150, a resin with excellent heat resistance can be obtained with difficulty. On the other hand, if the average molecular weight exceeds 1500, solubility in a solvent, for example, a halo containing nonflammable solvent such as l,l,l trichloroethane. is inferior. Preferably, the average molecular weight is 200 to 1200.Also, for the component a , a resin obtained by allowing an epoxy resin to react with Cmeth acrylic acid in the presence of an organic metal compound or an organic phosphorus compound is preferred. This is because the cured product of the curable composition of this invention can have excellent electrical characteristics.The epoxy resin to be used for preparation of the partially meth acrylated epoxy resin is not particularly limited, but inclusive of any of those known generally as epoxy resins. Typical examples may include, for example, bisphenol A type epoxy resin, bisphenol F type epoxy resin, phenol novolac type epoxy resin, cresol novolac type epoxy resin, hydrogenated bisphenol A type epoxy resin, glycidylether type epoxy resins obtained by the reaction between phenols or alcohols and epichlorohydrin, glycidylester type epoxy resins obtained by the reaction between aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids and epichlorohydrin.

If the amount employed is less than 0.1 by weight, no satisfactory curing characteristics can be obtained, while electrical characteristics and adhesiveness will be lowered at a level in excess of 5 by weight. Next, as the organic silicon compound, a compound capable of forming silanol groups by heating and or photoirradiation may effectively be used. For example, compounds having at least one selected from the group consisting of alkoxysilyl groups, aryloxysilyl groups, peroxysilyl groups and a ketosilyl groups may be employed.An organic silicon compound having at least one of alkoxysilyl groups and aryloxysilyl groups can be used together with the above organic metal compound to exhibit the curability of the epoxy groups by heating. Also, an organic silicon compound having at least one of peroxysilyl groups and a ketosilyl groups can be used together with the above organic metal compound to exhibit curability of epoxy groups by photoirradiation and or heating.Among these organic silicon compounds, specific examples of organic silicon compounds having at least one of alkoxysilyl groups and aryloxysilyl groups may include triphenylmethoxy silane, triphenylethoxy silane, triphenylpropoxy silane, triphenylbenzyloxy silane, triphenylphenoxy silane, diphenyltolylmethoxy silane, diphenyltolylethoxy silane, diphenyldimethoxy silane, diphenyldiethoxy silane, diphenyldipropoxy silane, dimethylphenylmetoxy silane, dimethylphenylethoxy silane, dimethyldimethoxy silane, dimethyldiethoxy silane, dimethyldiphenoxy silane and the like.Specific examples of the compounds having peroxysilyl groups may include tert butylperoxytriphenyl silane, di tert butylperoxy diphenylsilane, l,l dimethylpropylperoxytriphenyl silane, di l,l dimethylpropylperoxy diphenylsilane, l methylethylperoxytriphenylsilane, di l methylethylperoxy diphenyl silane, tert butylperoxymethyldiphenyl silane, tert butylperoxydimethylphenyl silane and the like.Specific examples of the compounds having a ketosilyl groups may include benzoyltriphenyl silane, benzoylmethyldiphenylsilane, benzoyldimethylphenyl silane, acetyltriphenyl silane, propionyltriphenyl silane, acetylmethyldiphenyl silane, benzoyltrimethyl silane, benzoylmethoxydiphenyl silane and the like.

If the amount employed is less than 0.1 by weight, no satisfactory curing characteristics can be obtained, while there may sometimes be caused problems such as increased cost or lowering in adhesiveness, etc. at a level in excess of 10 by weight.The respective proportions to be formulated of the organic metal compound and the organic silicon compound of the curing catalyst c to be used in this invention have been described above, but it is preferred to employ the whole component c in an amount of 0.5 to 10 by weight based on the total amount of the components a to c or the total amount of the components a to d when containing the component d , when the composition of this invention is to be used for the solder resist of a printed wiring plate.When the composition of this invention is to be employed for the solder resist of a printed wiring plate, it is preferred to add, in addition to the above components, a compound d having at least one group selected from acryloyl group, methacryloyl group and epoxy group, and the compound d is added for the purpose of controlling viscosity, improving photocurability, imparting flexibility of the composition according to this invention.

The amounts to be formulated may be 300 parts by weight or less, preferably 200 parts by weight or less, based on the total amount of the components a to d . If these additives exceed 300 parts by weight, it is not preferred because photocurability and or heat curability of the curable resin composition will be inferior.Particularly, when the composition of the present inventon is employed for solder resist of printed wiring plate, the amount of the above components formulated should be 100 parts or less, preferably 70 parts by weight or less.The curable resin composition of this invention can be produced readily by mixing and sirring predetermined amounts of the above components in a conventional manner.The curable resin comosition of this invention can be cured by photoirradition and heating to exhibit excellent characteristics, namely electrical characteristics, adhesiveness, mechanical toughness and het resistance.The wavelength of light advantageous for curing of the curable resin composition of this invention may generally be within the range of from 180 to 700 nm, preferably from 180 to 400 nm.

The method of curing and the order are not particularly limited, but there may generally be employed the method in which heating is effected subsequent to photoirradiation or the method in which photo irradiation and heating are simultaneously conducted. As the method for forming the image of solder resist with the curable resin composition of this invention, either screen printing method or photographic method may be applicable. When photographic method is employed, after exposure, developing can be carried out by use of a nonflammable halogenated hydrocarbon type solvent such as 1,1, l trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethane, followed by heating curing to impart characteristics such as electrical characteristics, solder heat resistance, humidity resistance, adhesiveness, etc. as demanded for solder resist.This invention is described in more detail by referring to Examples and Comparative examples, in which parts indicate all parts by weight .Example IA curable resin composition was prepared by formulating 100 parts of a partially acrylated epoxy resin epoxy equivalent 810, free acid 0.15 meq g, epoxy group acryloyl group 1 3 obtained by allowing 500 parts of an epoxy resin, Epikote 828 trade name, produced byYuka Shell Epoxy Co., bisphenol A type epoxy resin, average molecular weight 380, epoxy equivalent 190 to react with 142 parts of acrylic acid with the use of 13 parts of trisacetylacetonatoaluminum as the catalyst and 2.6 parts of p methoxyphenol as the thermal polymerization inhibitor at 110 OC for 12 hours, 30 parts of 1,4 dioxane, 4 parts of l hydroxy l methylethyl phenyl ketone, one part of trisCethylacetoacetato aluminum and 3 parts of tert butylperoxytriphenyl silane.The curable resin composition was applied uniformly by a bar coater on a copper plate, dried at 80 OC for 10 minutes to remove the solvent and form a coated film having tackiness with a thickness of 50 um.

The pencil hardness was 4H, the electrical resistance under normal conditions was 8 x 1013 Q and after moisture absorption was 7 x 1012 Q. Example 8A curable resin composition of this invention was prepared by mixing 70 parts of the partially acrylated epoxy resin synthesized in Example 6, 20 parts of trimethylolpropane, 5 parts of benzyldimethyl ketal, 1 part of trisacetylacetonatoaluminum, 4 parts of tert butylperoxytriphenyl silane, 10 parts of methyl methacrylatestyrene 2 1 copolymer, 2 parts of colloidal silica, 10 parts of silica powder, 0.6 parts ofPhthalocyanine Green, 0.3 parts of silicone oil and 150 parts of methylethyl ketone.
