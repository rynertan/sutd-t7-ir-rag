# Improved building structures.

## Abstract
A fixing bracket 5 in a roof construction is a metal sheet with two parallel grooves 39,40 pressed therein to protrude as ribs from the other side of the sheet, each groove extending from one edge of the sheet to another with two straight end portions and a central partcircular central portion. The outer edge of the sheet is concentrically part circular and the inner edge is folded up at 38. Such a bracket, or a pair of such brackets back to back with grooves 39, 40 protruding, can connect cold rolled channels 1,2 e.g. as used for the uprights or rafters of a portal frame structure, with compatible longitudi nal base grooves. The channels are again usually used in back to back pairs and the brackets are bolted within these back to back pairs of channels. The included angle can be from 90 135 for eaves brackets, or from 90 180 for ridge brack ets.
