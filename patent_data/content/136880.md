# Gate array type semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A gate array type semiconductor device including a plurality of basic cells 11 arranged in an array and diffusion regions 18, 19 for suppressing latchup between the basic cells 11 in the array has each of the diffusion regions 18, 19 formed as a comb shaped structure. The teeth 18c, 19c of the structures 18, 19 extend between the basic cells 11 in each column and occupy less space than the conventional diffusion regions 14, 15 since ohmic contacts are no longer required between every pair of adjacent basic cells. The comb shaped diffusion regions 18, 19 partially enclose each basic cell 11 .
