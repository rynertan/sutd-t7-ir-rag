A typical example of the conventional data output circuit is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the data output circuit comprises data latch circuits L1 to L4, a data output control circuit D, and a couple of output transistors 01 and 02. The latch circuits L1 to L4 are respectively coupled with memory arrays C1 to C4, each including a number of matrix arrayed memory cells, through pairs of data transfer nodes I 01 and In the read mode of the dynamic memory, data are concurrently read out from the memory cells in the memory arrays C1 to C4 at the address x, y , as specified by an address signal. The data read out are transferred, in the form of a potential difference, to the four pairs of data transfer nodes I 01 and In the subsequent active modes, the switch signals R2 to R4 are selected, and the data stored in the latch circuits L2 to L4 are output to the output node DOUT in the above mentioned manner. Figs. 2A and 28 illustrate a detailed circuit arrangement of the conventional data output circuit of Fig. 1. All the transistors are of N channel MOS type in the output circuit. As shown in Figs. 2A and 2B the latch circuit L1 comprises a flip flop made up of transistors 0102 and 0103, and switching transistors 0101, and 0104 to 0109. The transistor 0101 receives, at its gate, a signal A. One end of the current flow path of the transistor 0101 is connected, through a node N0101, to the junction between the current flow path of the transistors 0102 and 0104 and the current flow path of the transistors 0103 and 0105. The other end of the current flow path of the transistor 0101 is connected to VSS. The transistors 0102, 0104, 0106, 0108 are series connected. Similarly, the transistors 0103, 0105, 0107, and 0109 are series connected. The drain of the transistor 0102 is connected to the data transfer node I 01 and the gates of the transistors 0103 and 0105. The drain of the transistor 0103 is connected to the node The circuit arrangement of the latch circuit L1 is similarly applied to the remaining latch circuits L2 to L4. The source of the transistor 0108 in the latch circuit L1 is connected to those of the corresponding transistors 0208, 0308 and 0408 in the other latch circuits L2, L3 and L4. Similarly, the source of the transistor 0109 in the latch circuit L1 is connected to those of 0209, 0309 and 0409 in the other latch circuits L2, L3 and L4. The interconnection of the sources of the transistors 0108, 0208, 0308 and 0408 in the latch circuits L1 to L4 is connected to the intermediate node Do. The interconnection of the source of the transistors 0109, 0209, 0309 and 0409 is connected to the intermediate node The intermediate nodes Do and The data output control circuit D comprises the transistors 014 to 023. The data output drive signal OUT is coupled with the transistors 014 and 015. The signal p is also applied to the gate of the transistors 020 and 021. The transistors 014 and 020 are connected in series between the signal OUT and VSS. Similarly, the transistors 015 and 021 are connected in series between OUT and VSS. The gates of the transistors 016 and 017 are coupled with VDD. The current path of the transistors 016 and 019 is connected between the gate of the transistor 014 and VSS. Similarly, the current paths of the transistors 017 and 018 is connected between the gate of the transistor 015 and VSS. The node Do is connected to the junction between the current paths of the transistors 016 and 019. The other node The gate of the output transistor 01 is connected, through a node N01, to the gate of the transistor 023. The gate of the output transistor 02 is connected, through a node N02, to the gate of the transistor 022. The transistors 01 and 02 are connected in series between VDD and VSS.

In the precharge mode, a row address select signal The address signal applied when the signal One of the switch signals R1 to R4, which are coupled with the paired transistors 0108 and 0109, 0208 and 0209, 0308 and 0309, and 0408 and 0409, is selected by an address designation, and set at high level. It is assumed here that the node I 01 is high in level and the node If the node I 01 is low and the node I 01 is high, the transistor 02 is turned on and a low data signal appears at the output DOUT. The column address signal goes high again and the read operation enters the precharge mode. The switch signal R1 becomes VSS in potential level to electrically disconnect the latch circuit L1 from the paired nodes Do and The signal As described above, in the prior art circuit of Figs. 2A and 2B, the output terminal pairs of the latch circuit L1 to L4 are connected to a single pair of intermediate nodes Do and Prior art document EP Al 0 111 741 discloses an integrated semiconductor circuit including a memory data output circuit. In this output circuit the transfer of a drive signal is controlled by data D, It is an object of the present invention to provide a data output circuit with a nibble function for use in a dynamic memory in which the data read in the nibble mode is sped up by eliminating the timing restriction to set the level of the data output drive signal OUT high. To solve this object the present invention provides a data output circuit as stated in claim 1. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to Figs. 4A and 4B, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a data output circuit with a nibble function according to the present invention. As shown, the data output circuit of the present invention comprises latch circuits L1 to L4, data output control circuits D1 to D4 and an auxiliary control circuit DA, and output transistors 1 and 2. All of the transistors used in this circuit are N channel MOS transistors. The latch circuits L1 to L4 have the same circuit arrangements, and this is true for the control circuits D1 to D4 as well. Accordingly, the latch circuit L1 and the control circuit D1 are both explained. The latch circuit L1 comprises transistors 101 to 113. The paired transistors 102 and 103 form a flip flop. The data transfer node I 01 is connected to the drain of the transistor 102 and the gate of the transistor 103. The data transfer node The data output control circuit D1 comprises transistors 114 to 119. The data output drive signals OUT is applied to the drain of each of the transistors 114 and 115. The source of each of the transistors 116 to 119 is connected to VSS. The intermediate nodes N106 and N107 are coupled with the gates of the transistors 114 and 115, respectively. The signal p is coupled with the gates of the transistors 118 and 119. The junction between the current paths of the transistors 114 and 116 is connected by way of the transfer line TL1 to those of the current flow paths of the corresponding transistors in the remaining control circuits D2 to D4. Similarly, the junction between the current paths of the transistors 115 and 117 is connected by way of the transfer line TL2 to those of the current flow paths of the corresponding transistors in the control circuit D2 to D4. The output drive circuit DA comprises transistors 11 to 14. The transfer lines TL1 and TL2 are coupled with one end of the current path of each of the transistors 11 and 13 and one end of the current path of each of the transistors 12 and 14, respectively. The other ends of the current paths of these transistors 11 to 14 are coupled with VSS. The gates of the transistors 13 and 14 are coupled with a signal p2. Nodes N1 and N2 are located between the gates of the transistors 12 and 1 and between the gates of the transistors 11 and 2, respectively. The output node DOUT is connected to the junction between the current paths of the transistors 1 and 2. Other detailed interconnections among the circuit elements are referred to in the drawings of Figs. 4A and 4B. The operation of the data output circuit thus arranged will be described with reference to Figs. 5A to 5L. In the precharge mode the row address select signal When the signal Assume now that, of the switch signals R1 to R4, the signal R1 is selected by an address designation and goes high, and that the node I 01 is high and the node The column address signal The signal To start the data write at the initial stage of the active cycle, the drive signal OUT is kept at VSS level, so that no data appears at the output node DOUT. As seen from the foregoing description, the timing to set the drive signal OUT at H level for the output of the data onto the output node DOUT may be set at any time position during the read cycle. For example, if the drive signal OUT is rendered high before the switch signal R goes high, the data is output in response to the H level of the switch signal R. In contrast, if the drive signal OUT is set high after the switch signal R goes high, the data is output in response to the high level of the drive signal OUT. Turning now to Figs. 6A to 6G, waveforms of the signals of the respective data output circuits of the present invention and the prior art, are shown both for the purpose of comparison and in the interest of explaining the read operation. In Figs. 6F and 6G figures dotted lines indicate the waveforms of the signal in the data output circuit of the present invention. As clearly seen from Figs. 6A to 6G, in the prior art outputting the data onto the node DOUT necessitated that one of the intermediate nodes Do and
