# SYNTHETIC TANNING AGENTS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing syntans from a phenolic material rich in ortho and para substituted alkyl phenols. The alkyl phenols are subjected to sulphonation and condensation reaction with formaldehyde to produce a synthetic sulphonated resin. It has been found that the phenolic material used produces a sulphonated resin which is superior in solubility and colour to those conventionally pro duced from alkyl phenols rich in the meta isomer. The pro cess also enables the use of a crude alkylate from phenol directly without any purification without adversely affecting the quality of the resin.
