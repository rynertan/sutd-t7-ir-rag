# Slide assembly.

## Abstract
A seat 11 is fitted to a vehicle body 12 through a pair of slide assemblies 13 permitting fore and aft adjustment of the seat. Each slide assembly has a seat slide 15 which is integral with or secured to a part 29, 51 of the seat itself, so that a compact assembly is achieved and the slide gets strength from the part of the seat. The body slide 14 can be supplied assembled with the one slide in the seat, there being two assemblies one at each side of the seat, and they can be secured to the body of the vehicle through a bracket 31 which can be one of a number of different designs selected to suit the particular vehicle body in which it is being used, or can be capable of some deformation to accommodate manufacturing tolerance in the body of the vehicle.

## Description
SLIDE ASSEMBLY This invention relates to a slide assembly for example for the mounting of a vehicle seat in a manner to permit fore and aft adjustment to suit the occupant. One example of such a seat slide is the subject of European Patent Application No, 1301464 published under the No. 0037726 on the 14th october, 1981. An object of the present invention is to provide a design of such a slide assembly which can permit easy fitting in spite of manufacturing tolerance of the vehicle body in which it is to be fitted, or in spite of the need to fit the seat in vehicles of various designs. Another object is to provide a design which is neat and compact and a further object is to provide a design which can achieve some vertical rigidity from components of the vehicle seat itself. According to the present invention, a vehicle seat slide assembly comprising relative slidable fore and aft slides and means for attaching one of the slides to a part of a vehicle body, is characterised by anyone of the following features, or any combination of those features The other slide that is the slide other than the one for attaching to a part of a vehicle body may be integral with, or secured to, a vertical flange which is in turn integral with, or secured to, the side of a vehicle seat. In a simple case a vertical side wall of the vehicle seat is formed at its lower edge into the form of the said other slide, but in a more complicated arrangement a vertical web extending upwards from the said other slide can be connected to a vertical web forming a part of the seat through means providing height adjustment. According to another feature, the slides are located in relation to each other for foreand aft adjustment, through rows of balls or rollers including one row or two rows arranged to transfer the vertical loads from the seat slide to the body slide, and two rows or one row for providing lateral location between the slides. The slides can be normally out of contact with each other other than through the balls, and have respective co operating horizontal surfaces between which the balls in one or two rows run, but an additional row or rows of balls can be disposed between the slides to prevent lateral movement or relative angular movement and keep the load supporting balls properly located. According to another feature, the adjustment means comprises a bracket capable of adjustment or deformation , or is one of a number of alternative brackets, or both, and that enables the slide assembly itself to be of precision manufacture but nevertheless to be capable of being fitted into a vehicle body which may be one of a number of different designs or one in which manufacturing tolerances are greater than can be accommodated by the slides so that such tolerances can be accommodated by perhaps bending or drilling the bracket. That method of attachment enables the foreand aft adjustment slides to be formed integrally or in a unitary assembly with the seat with one slide under each side, and then the complete seat with its slides can be fitted to the vehicle body by use of the appropriate brackets. That enables the slide to achieve strength and rigidity from the material of the seat, allows a very compact design to be achieved, and permits the slides to be manufactured with great precision, and is a considerable advantage over the usual practice which is to provide a pair of slides and bolt one of the slides to the underside of the seat and the other of the slides to the floor of the vehicle. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways, and certain embodiments will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURES 1 and 2 are diagrammatic views from the front showing two different ways in which a seat can be mounted on the floor of a vehicle using a pair of slide assemblies in accordance with the invention FIGURE 3 is a front view of a preferred form of slide assembly FIGURE 4 is a side elevation of the slide assembly of FIGURE 3 to a reduced scale FIGURE 5 is a plan view of a part of the assembly of FIGURE 4 FIGURE 6 is a view corresponding to FIGURE 3 of a modified slide assembly FIGURE 7 is a view corresponding to FIGURE 4 of the assembly of FIGURE 6 and FIGURE 8 is a view corresponding to FIGURE 3 of another form of slide assembly. A seat as indicated generally at 11 in FIGURES 1 and 2 is mounted from a vehicle floor 12 by means of a pair of slide assemblies 13 extending in a fore and aft direction one under each side of the seat. Each slide assembly as seen from the front is as shown in FIGURE 3, and comprises a pair of interlinked slides 14 and 15 with the same cross section, which may be described as being similar to a shepherd s crook, in that from a web 16 the section bends over with one hand as indicated at 17, 18 and 19 and then bends back with the other hand as indicated at 21. The two slides can be assembled together by longitudinal sliding, and are retained in relative location against both twisting and lateral movement by three rows of balls, there being one ball of each row visible in FIGURE 3. There is a row of balls 23 between the bend 17 of one hand of the slide 14 and the bend 21 of the other hand of the slide 15, and another row of balls 24 between the bend of one hand of the other slide 15 and the bend 21 of the other hand of the one slide 14. Then the third row of balls of larger diameter as shown at 25 is positioned between the bends of the one hand 19 of the two slides. The dimensions are such that the sections have to be sprung slightly to get the balls into position so that they are slightly preloaded to prevent rattling, and in the assembled condition the two slides are out of contact with each other so that fore and aft adjustment occurs purely by rolling of the balls 23, 24, and 25 without any sliding between co operating surfaces of the slides. The other slide 15 leads to an upstanding web 26 which is connected in a conventional manner to the underside of the seat 11, possibly with the inclusion of some form of height adjustment mechanism. The one slide 14 is welded or bolted to a bracket which may be of any of the forms shown at 31,32,33 and 34 in FIGURES 1 and 2, to suit the shape of the floor of the particular vehicle in which the slide is being fitted. The attachments can have provision for some deformation perhaps simple bending about a fore and aft axis 30 or some adjustment laterally or angularly as at 20 to allow for inaccuracies in vehicle manufacture, and that enables accurately manufactured slide assemblies to be used in a wide range of vehicles. It will be observed from FIGURE 3 that the balls 23,24 and 25 run on axes of which two are only a little displaced from a vertical plane, through the other, and that gives the slide assembly good vertical rigidity. In a preferred arrangement there are two balls in which of the rows 23 and 24, one at the front and one at the rear, as shown in FIGURES 4 and 7, whereas there are three large balls 25 in the central race namely one at the front, and two at the back where the loads tend to be higher. The weight of the slide 15 and the seat 11 above it is carried on the slide 14 primarily through the balls 25, and the balls 23 and 24 are used to achieve proper lateral location to ensure that the bend 19 of the slide 15 sits on the balls 25 which in turn sit properly on the bend 19 on the slide 14. The seat 11 includes a cushion supporting part 27 and a stiffener 28 joined by a vertical flange 29 which continues below the stiffener 28 and is welded to a vertical plate 35 which can slide vertically in relation to the web 26 when a pin 39 is disengaged. That allows the height of the seat to be adjusted after which the pin 39 is engaged, and the plate 35 can be considered to be fast with the web 26. The transverse tube 40 ensures that adjustment of height is achieved at both slide assemblies, one at each side of the seat, at the same time, and there can be a similar arrangement both at the front and at the rear of the seat.Such a height adjustment mechanism is shown in FIGURE 7 of European Patent ApplicationNo. 81301464.4 published in October, 1981, and is merely described here as indicating how it can be included in an embodiment of the present invention. Once the pin 39 has been engaged, it will be clear that the vertical plate 29 forming an integral part of the seat 11 is effectively fast with the web 26 which is an integral part of the slide, and that makes for a very neat and spacesaving arrangement of the fore and aft slide while giving the whole mounting good vertical rigidity. FIGURES 1 and 2 show how the mounting can be on a floor, or on a sill, or on a tunnel, and it will be clear that the brackets 31,32,33,34 can be designed to have sufficient tear strength to carry such loads as may be demanded by seat belt restraint systems anchored to the seat fixing. For locating the slides in a selected position of fore and aft adjustment, a trigger 36 may be used, and that can be pivotally mounted as shown in FIGURES 4 and 5, at 37 on one slide and have windows 38 arranged to engage castellations 39 in the lower edge of the other slide. It can be released by a transverse bar 41 underneath the front of the seat for pivoting the trigger at 37 in a manner which is known in itself. FIGURES 6 and 7 show an alternative arrangement in which a locking tongue 43 pivotally mounted on one slide 15 about a fore and aft axis 45 has two teeth 47 which can engage in two adjacent holes 44 in a line of holes in the slide 14. Release is by a lever 48 united to the tongue at 45 and connected through a connecting rod 46 with a corresponding lever and tongue on the slide assembly under the other slide of the seat. A seat belt fixing is shown at 49 in FIGURES 4 and 7 The top of a bracket 31 is shown in FIGURE 6 welded to one slide 14. FIGURE 8 shows an alternative arrangement which is somewhat similar to that of FIGURE 3, although the arrangement is simpler in that there is no provision for height adjustment of the seat 11, and it is in fact an integral component 51 of the seat which constitutes the vertical web 26 carrying one of the slides. In the arrangement of FIGURE 8 the slide sections are not the same as each other, as is the case with FIGURE 3, but it can be seen how they have co operating sections providing races for three lines of balls 51,52,and 53. In this case the weight of the seat 11 is transferred to the lower slide 54 primarily through the balls 51 and 53, whereas the balls 52 are used for lateral and angular location to ensure proper seating on the balls 51 and 53. The lower slide 54 is secured to the floor of the vehicle by a similar bracket 31. The trigger 36 can also be seen in FIGURE 8 and that can operate generally in a manner similar to the method described with reference to FIGURES 4 and 5. The arrangement of FIGURE 8 is a particularly neat and compact arrangement. The slide can be considered to be a part of the seat frame with a double advantage of saving weight and achieving rigidity in the vertical plane of the member 51.
