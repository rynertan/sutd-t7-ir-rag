# Process for preparing compositions containing quaternary ammonium compounds.

## Abstract
A process for preparing compositions containing certain quaternary ammonium compounds from tertiary amines selected from the group consisting of tertiary amines contain ing one or two long chain aliphatic groups, and mixtures thereof, is disclosed. The process comprises reacting the ter tiary amine with dimethyl sulfate, diehtyl sulfate, or trimethyl phosphate. The reaction is performed in a reaction medium selected from the group consisting ofcompounds which have a melting point below about 100 C. preferably are capable of dissolving the desired quaternary ammonium compound, and which contain either i an ester linkage derived from a fatty acid, ii a primary hydroxyl group, or iii both, and mixtures of said compounds. The reaction typically is per formed at a temperature between about 50 C and about 15 C for a length of time sufficient to convert at least a portion of the tertiary amine to the desired quaternary ammonium compound. The compositions obtained in this way can be utilized for conditioning clothes, such as in an automatic laundry dryer.
