# ELECTROCHEMICAL METHOD OF TESTING FOR SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS, AND TESTING APPARATUS FOR USE IN THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method of electrochemically testing a bare or chemi cally treated metal or other electrically conductive surface to determine its characteristics, by contacting the surface with a dilute electrolyte, measuring at least the steady state potential of the surface and preferably also the direct current amperages obtained when respective small positive and negative voltage differentials relative to the steady state potential typically 50 millivolts are applied to the electrolyte solution and com paring and contrasting the measured results with those se cured with a standard comparison surface. This testing method is used to check the quality of the out put of metal pretreatment processes and in methods of control ling their operation. Testing apparatus used in these methods includes an open ended electrochemical cell, containing a standard re ference electrode and a counter electrode, for positioning on the surface to be tested as well as circuitry and meters for reading the steady state potential of the reference electrode and the currents flowing between the surface under test and the counter electrode via electrolyte in the cell.
