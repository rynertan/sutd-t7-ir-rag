# Activity sensor for pacemaker control.

## Abstract
A cardiac pacer is provided which incorporates a sensor 26 responsive to the physical activity of the pacer wearing patient. The output of the physical activity sensor 26 is uti lized by control circuitry 28 of a physiological sensor 22 to enable the physiological sensor to monitor a selected physio logical parameter only if the physical activity of the pacer wear ing patient exceeds a selected threshold. In this manner, the electrical energy requirements of the pacer are lessened.
