# Novel aminopropylpivalamides and a method of preparation.

## Abstract
3 Aminopropylpivalamide is prepared by contacting pivalic acid with 1,3 diaminopropane at temperatures above the boiling point of 1 ,3 diaminopropane and the latter is distilled off. The residue may be refluxed to provide 2 t butyltetrahydro pyrimidine. In a further step 2 alkyl pyrimidines are obtained by dehydrogenation of the tetrahydro pyrimidines over a supported noble metal catalyst under conditions which do not generate water and in which no water is added.
