# Composition for absorption refrigeration.

## Abstract
A composition for absorption refrigeration which com prises a fluorinated hydrocarbon refrigerant, an amide or glycol ether solvent serving as an absorption liquid, and a phosphite stabilizer. The stabilizer is used in an amount of 0.05 to 0.5 wt of the absorption liquid calculated as phos phorus, within which range the phosphite stabilizer can suitably protect the refrigerant and the absorption liquid from deteriorating and decomposing at high operation temperatures.
