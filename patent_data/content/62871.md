# Load management terminal.

## Abstract
The invention provides a load management terminal control logic circuit which is utilized as an end device in a utility s distribution network communication system. The distribution network carries electrical power as well as communication signals. The load management terminal is comprised of a power line coupling unit 27 for connecting the load management terminal to the power distribution network. A signal receiver and conditioning unit 29 pro duces a command signal in response to a received com munication signal. A solid state memory 32 contains preprogrammed instructions and data, and a microprocessor 31 performs load control functions in response to the command signal. The microprocessor additionally produces a diagnostic signal being in a low state in response to one of the preprogrammed instructions and being in a high state in response to another of the preprogrammed instructions. A reset circuit monitors the diagnostic signal and resets the microprocessor in response to irregularities in the diagnostic signal thereby greatly increasing the reliability of the load management terminal.
