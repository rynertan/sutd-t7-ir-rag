## Description
Electron Source of Lanthanum Hexaboride and method of constructing same. Field of the invention The present invention relates to the use of lanthanum hexaboride LaB6 as an electron emitter. Such a source finds application in many microelectronic engineering applications. Background to the invention Known lanthanum hexaboride emitters are formed of sintered powder material or single crystals mechanically or chemically shaped into a cone or pyramid or sometimes into a truncated cone or rod. The aim hitherto has always been to provide a small emitting area from which electrons emerge with rotational symmetry. Lanthanum hexaboride material is chosen because it has a lower work function and will emit electrons at a lower temperature than tungsten, for example. This means that because of the low work function more intensive electron sources with smaller emission surfaces and longer lifetimes are possible. It is known to grow cubes of lanthanum hexaboride in a natural crystallographic manner. T. Aita, U. Kawabe and Y. Honda, Single Crystal Growth of Lanthanum Hexaboride in Molten Aluminium , Appl. Physics Vol. 13, No. 2, p.391, 1974 . In this process, growth, crystal form and size are determined by selection of the ratio of lanthanum to boron and by the pressures and temperatures used. Using this method, LaB6 single crystals can be produced in large quantities. During the development of the present invention, cube shaped LaB6 crystals have been mounted in such an orientation that a corner of the cube formed by three cube faces forms a point electron source. In many new applications however, some of which will be referred to later, line electron sources are needed. Such sources are already used to a limited extent, for example in various X ray tubes where a heated wire is used as the electron source. Line sources of this kind, in limited usage hitherto, can be constructed with a ratio of length to width of the emitting line of at best 10 1 for example a wire of 100 um cross sectional diameter along 1 mm length. Longer wires cannot be mounted in a manner which remains stable at the high operating temperatures necessary in use. For many modern applications of electron emitters an increased length to linewidth ratio would be desirable. Line sources with such higher ratios of length to width would make possible many new applications in electron beam technology. Prior Art US Patent 4482838 Ishii et al describes a process for obtaining a thermionic emission cathode of a single crystal in which one end of the crystal is machined to form the electron emitter. Damage caused by the machining process disrupts the crystalline structure in the region of the machined surfaces and the US Patent describes how this damage can be removed, so as to expose what are described in the patent as natural crystal faces, either by vacuum heat treatment similar to the evaporation which occurs during initial stages of the life of an emitter in scanning electron microscopes and the like or by a much faster process of chemical etching. However there is nothing in the US Patent which would lead one to employ anything other than a fabricated ie machined crystal as the emitter, which is quite distinct from the present invention. Additionally although the US Patent is directed to the production of single point source types of emitter, viz. the formation of a generally pointed end surrounded by faces of a polyhedron at one end of a column of crystal , Figs 4a and 4b of the US Patent show a crystal having a hipped roof form, with the ridge of the roof forming the pointed end. However it will be seen from a study of the US Patent that the ridge of the roof will not serve as a line source since the ends of the ridge merge into the triangular regions of the hipped roof configuration and there are no well defined ends to the ridge. Furthermore the length of the ridge will be of the order of a few microns given that the typical diameter of the crystal column is of the order of 1mm in the first place. As such the ridge will not act as a line source but as an inferior point source. Object of the invention It is an object of the present invention to provide a line source, for example having a line length of 1mm whilst maintaining sufficiently high emission densities at the same time. It is another object of the invention to provide a method of making such sources. The invention The problem is solved by an electron emitter comprising a lanthanum hexaboride LaB6 single crystal mounted on to a heatable support in such a manner that one of the grown crystal edges forms an electron emitting line source and plane ends of the crystal substantially perpendicular to the direction of the edge, define the opposite ends of the line. The invention makes it possible not only to create a higher ratio of length to width but also for the first time to construct electron line sources smaller in width than visible light wavelengths. Furthermore this can be achieved over a length of many millimetres. Thus, ratios of length to width of 100 1, 500 1 and even 1000 1 become feasible. In practice, many applications can be visualised for line sources which are easier to handle, more cost effective and more precise in their dimensions, and which in addition give improved signal noise ratios. The signal noise ratios are increased for many applications by the same factor by which the ratio of length to width of the source increases. In addition since the emission of LaB6 is much higher, for example, than tungsten, such a line source in accordance with the invention is of sufficient intensity to open up new applications of usage, with all the resultant advantages. In known manner the total emission of a line source formed by the edge of a LaB6 single crystal can be influenced by an electric field established by a negative voltage applied to a control electrode assembly located between the line source and an accelerating electrode assembly. The negative voltage is adjustable in known manner to suit each specific application. It is advantageous to mount the LaB6 crystal into the heatable holder with two grown 1,0,0 faces forming the edge. This gives stable emission right from the beginning of use. The side emission of the two 1,0,0 faces may be controlled by appropriately shaped electrodes, whilst the high available electron emission current may easily be decreased if the resulting width of the energy distribution is not acceptable. As the edge of the emitter of this invention is atomically sharp, the energy distribution of the emitted electrons may in practice be made extremely small, for example as low as 0.4 eV, which is of decisive importance for many applications. Because the edge is defined as the junction of two crystal faces, it remains sharp despite removal of material from the two faces during use. Although 1,0,0 orientation has been referred to herein as a preferred crystal type, any other orientation may be used eg 1,1,0 1,1,1 2,1,0 etc provided it has a suitable edge to serve as the electron emitter. According to another aspect of the invention a method of constructing a line source electron emitter comprises the steps of mounting a single crystal on a heatable mount so that one of the naturally occurring edges of the crystal formed during growth of the crystal constitutes a ridge from which electrons can be emitted, the ridge being bounded on opposite sides by two naturally grown faces of the crystal and with the ends of the ridge being defined by plane ends of the crystal which are substantially perpendicular to the direction of the ridge. Description of drawings In the following the invention is exemplified with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the mounting of a cube of LaB6 crystal to a single heating wire by means of a supportive material. Figure 2 shows a similar, mechanically more stable configuration with two heating wires. Figure 3 shows the mounting of the emitting crystal by clamping between two blocks. Description of embodiments The drawings show different mounting possibilities of a cubic LaB6 crystal with one grown edge of the crystal as the line source. In the first two examples, the cube of LaB6 crystal 1 is mounted in supporting material 4, and reference 2 denotes the line edge forming the emitter while reference 3 denotes a single or double heating wire. The emitting edge 2 emerges from the supporting material 4, which can consist of sintered titanium carbide, and which partially covers the cube 1 whilst leaving the emitting edge 2 exposed. In contrary to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the emitting edge could also be mounted not vertical but parallel to the heating wire. In the configuration according to Figure 3 the cubic crystal 1, with the same orientation of the emitting edge 2 as in Figures 1 and 2, is clamped between two carbon blocks 5. The blocks 5 are pressed by respective clamps 6 against two parallel naturally flat surfaces of the cubic LaB6 crystal. It is evident that mounting possibilities other than as shown in the drawings exist for crystals emitting from a single edge. For example, mounting procedures known for point electron sources can readily be adapted for the purposes of the present invention. Two possible applications of the invention to electron beam technology with round electron sources, where physical limits of development on existing lines have been reached, are as follows 1. Electron beam lithography. E beam writing of a mask for X ray lithography with minimum feature sizes of 0.2 um requires writing times of approximately 80 hours on a 7.5 cm wafer. In this case throughput is limited by the serial writing process using a circular electron source, even with a variable cross section beam shape system. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a line electron source in accordance with the invention and a parallel writing process. 2. Electron beam testing. Electron beam testing of VLSI circuits is limited in spatial resolution, time resolution, and voltage resolution when a circular electron source is used, even when a variable cross section beam shape system is used. A line source in accordance with the invention enables much higher signal noise ratios to be otained by adapting the electron image of the line source to the size of an elongated electrode in the circuit, whose voltage is to be measured. In this way a considerable improvement in time resolution and voltage resolution can be obtained.
