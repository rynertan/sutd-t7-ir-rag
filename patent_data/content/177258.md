# FAST ACTING TUNER FOR MULTIPLE CHANNEL KLYSTRONS

## Abstract
A cylinder or barrel fitted with cams is used to limit the outward movement of spring loaded plungers attached to cavity shorting bars in a klystron. Different tunings of the klystron are achieved by rotating the cylinder so that different rows of cams limit the plungers. A linear solenoid is used to decouple the plungers from the cams before rotation. A stepping solenoid is used to move the cylinder from one setting to another.
