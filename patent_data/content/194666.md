# METHOD OF FABRICATING BIREFRINGENT OPTICAL FIBRES

## Abstract
The method uses a row material and dopant deposition technique, which requires vapour state reactants and ther mal sources for producing a temperature gradient suited to obtain a circularly and radially varying refractive index profile in the supporting tube.
