# Processes for the production of 1,2,3 trihydroxyphenyl compounds.

## Abstract
Pyrogallol, and analogues thereof having an alkyl, carboxy or alkoxycarbonyl substituent in the benzene ring, and their salts, are prepared by oxidising, preferably by hydrogen perox ide, the corresponding compounds in which 1 or 2 of the OH groups are replaced by COR⁵ groups where R⁵ represents hydrogen, alkyl or phenylalkyl. The production of intermediates is also described and some of these are novel.
