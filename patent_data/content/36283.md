# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LIQUID LIQUID EXTRACTION

## Abstract
An apparatus for effecting liquid liquid contact between an aqueous liquid medium and an organic liquid medium comprises a chamber for holding a body of each of the media having an agitator therein. One or both of the media are supplied to a mixing zone around the agitator. By means of the agitator a dispersion band is formed with a free space above and or below it which is devoid of baffles. A layer of disengaged lighter medium forms above the dispersion band and a layer of disengaged heavier medium below it, at least one of these layers extending into the or a corresponding free space. Disengaged lighter and or heavier medium is reco vered from the corresponding layer thereof at the same rate that it is supplied to the mixing zone.
