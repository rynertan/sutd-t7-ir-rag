# ELEMENT FOR EXCHANGING HEAT BETWEEN FLUIDS, AND RADIATOR CONSTRUCTED WITH THE SAID HEAT EXCHANGE ELEMENT

## Abstract
The invention belongs to the technical field of heat exchangers and relates, in particular, to an element for exchanging heat between two fluids of the same or of a differ ent nature, and to a process for constructing the said heat exchange element. The element according to the invention comprises a flat tubular element 1 and fins 3, the latter placed at least on the major sides 2a of the the former, directed crosswise to the direction in which the said element extends. In the region of the extremities thereof, the said tubular element has parts 4 devoid of fins, the depth of which corres ponds to the maximum height of the said fins 3.
