# Optical time division switching system employing optical bistable devices.

## Abstract
In an optical time division switching system, time division multiplexed calling and called station signals are arranged in incoming time slots and applied through an incoming common optical medium 15 to a first optical switching circuit 60 that switches the signals to optical bistable devices 81 84 in which the signals are stored as binary 1 s or 0 s. A second opti cal switching circuit 100 is coupled to the bistable devices for reading the stored calling station signal in the time slot of the called station and reading the stored called station signal in the time slot of the calling station to rearrange the signals in outgo ing time slots. The signals in the outgoing time slots are appli ed through an outgoing common optical medium 17 to a time division demultiplexer which sequentially distributes the signals to the calling and called stations.
