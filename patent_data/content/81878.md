## Description
This invention relates to a method for producing cells containing the enzyme cholesterol oxidase, using a strain of the Arthrobacter genus.The use of enzymes in the analysis of complex mixtures leads to considerable precision because of the specificity shown by these biological catalysts relative to common chemical reagents. Among others, the determination of cholesterol in biological fluids has assumed considerable importance in clinical chemistry. It has been proposed to use the enzyme cholesterol oxidase for this purpose see for example BritishPatent No. 1,385,320 . As stated, the object of this invention is the preparation of cells containing the enzyme cholesterol oxidase by using a microbe strain for which the ability to produce this enzyme has never been described.This strain, deposited at the collection of the NorthernRegionsl Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois, USA, underNo. NRRL B 11,115, was cited in the U.K. Patent N0 1.577.425 granteol Oil January 14, 19S1 , which related to a method for modifying the steroids based on their co oxidation with hydrocarbons. This strain was mentioned among others, all of which were able to induce modification reactions of the initial substrate, among which it was possible to identify oxidation of cholesterol to cholestenone.However, an examination of the contents of the aforessid application suggested nothing regarding the possibility of isolating a single enzymatic activity, as any one strain could be used to produce various modifications of the same substrate.We have now discovered that which constitutes the subject matter of the present patent application, namely that it is possible to produce and isolate with high efficiency the enzyme cholesterol oxidase starting from the aforesaid microbe strain.This strain is a non sporogenic strictly aerobic bacterium which during a growth period of 24 hours on solid culture media passes from a coccoid form of diameter 0.7 1.0 im to an irregular elongated. form with cells having a width of 0.7 1 m and a length of 1.5 4jum, sometimes joined in V shape, to then again become completely coccoid. The coccoid form is clearly Gwam . During the growth cycle, the appearance of globose forms Cystites of a diameter of about 2 3 iim was noted.The colonies on Nutrient Agar are opaque, with a complete periphery, and a colour which from white becomes intense pink after 3 4 days. However, on PS culture medium see example 1 they assume an intense orange colour. The total absence of aerial mycelium is noted on both culture media.These morphological characteristics enable the strain to be classed in the Arthrobacter genus, but it differs from that species of this genus described in Bergey s Manuel ofDeterminative Bacteriology 8th ed. 1974 by virtue of the strong pigmentation of the colonies. The physiological characteristics of the strain together with those reported in the literature for three strains taxonomically close to ours and described as producers of cholesterol oxidase are given in Table 1. The differences between these strains and our strain are indicated by an asterisk . TABLE 1 Brevibacterium Nocardia sp.

Patent 1,385,319 26 Feb. 1975.The microbe strain described heretofore is characterised by its capacity to use both n paraffins and cholesterol as the sole source of C, and by the fact that the oxidation of the cholesterol in a proliferative culture is intensified by the presence of n paraffins.We have observed that in the presence of n paraffins the strain produces a greater quantity of cholesterol oxidase.We have also observed that our strain produces the enzyme cholesterol oxidase even when cholesterol is absent, but its production increases if the culture medium contains cholesterol.The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following examples.

However, the cholesterol was omitted in one jar. After 32 hours of incubation, the culture broth containing cholesterol contained 0.23 U ml of cholesterol oxidase, whereas that without cholesterol contained 0.19 U ml of cholesterol oxidase.
