# Gasket of rubber or similar material.

## Abstract
A gasket 1 of elastic material, such as rubber or similar for use in forming a seal between respective sealing surfaces of two members to be joined, the sealing surfaces of the members being moved substantially parallel to each other during installation for squeezing the gasket therebetween. The gasket 1 comprises in combination a major portion or core 1, 1a, 1b which due to the squeezing between the seal ing surfaces effects a packing pressure, and a relatively thin gasket portion embracing the core so as to define a closed jacket 2, 2a, 2b, 32 around the core, said jacket being pro vided with a lubricant on the inside, and so as to transfer the movement taking place between the sealing surfaces via the jacket by the sliding thereof along the core. The jacket 32 may be provided with intermediate portions 40, 40a, 40b, 40c, 40d , such as folds, undulations or corrugations which are stretched during installation for thereby increasing the sliding length of the jacket.
