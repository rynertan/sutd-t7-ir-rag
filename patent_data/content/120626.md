# LEAFLET DISPENSER

## Abstract
A leaflet dispenser comprises at least three like channel section members 26 , one or more of which face upwardly to support the bottom edges of the leaflets and one or more pairs of which face inwardly to support the side edges of the leaf lets. Each member 26 comprises a base wall 27 , a rear side wall 28 , a front side wall 29 and one or more ribs 30 disposed between and substantially parallel with the side walls 28,29 . The rib or ribs 30 divide the member 26 into two or more sub channels into which leaflets may be put so that, although the dispenser can accommodate many leaflets, when only a few leaflets remain they will not bend and slide down into the dispenser. The base wall 27 has slots 33 therein to receive the rib or ribs 30 and front side wall 29 of another member 26 for storage purposes.
