# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING ACCELERATION IN A MULTI SHAFT GAS TURBINE ENGINE

## Abstract
A Free turbine, gas turbine engine provided with a pre swirl arrangement in the compressor, based on bleeding air from the compressor and using the bleed air as a pre swirl device upstream of the compressor to increase its rotational speed. A governor device, driven from the compressor rotor, controls the amount of pre swirl bleed air to maintain a constant compressor speed from minimum to maximum power. Compressor rotor and gas inertia effects during acceleration are thus eliminated.
