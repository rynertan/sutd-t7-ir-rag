# Catalytic cracking unit and operation.

## Abstract
A mixing chamber for catalyst and oil in a catalytic cracking unit 2 in which atomized oil is introduced prefer ably axially in a preferably vertically oriented transfer line or riser reactor 7 from an atomization chamber 102 segre gated from flow of cracking catalyst. The cracking catalyst flows with a radially inward component to the mouth of the riser 72 from the circumference thereof and mixes with the oil feed.
