# Clocked differential cascode voltage switch logic circuit.

## Abstract
A clocked differential cascode voltage switch CVS logic system is provided for a complete logic family which has a first switching circuit 10 that produces a given output signal at a first output node 14 and a second switching circuit 12 that produces a second output signal which is the comple ment of that of the given output signal at a second output node 18 . First and second clocked devices 24, 28 are connected from the first and second output nodes 14, 18 , respectively, to a voltage source V
