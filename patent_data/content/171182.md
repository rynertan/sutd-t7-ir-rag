# Variable capacity roller and vane type pumps.

## Abstract
A roller or vane type pump is described of the kind in which the cam ring is pivotally mounted within an external casing to vary the throw of the cam ring and hence the pump delivery, means is provided whereby a constant flow is obtained regard less of the pump speed. The cam surface of the cam ring is not wholly circular. The two portions of the cam surface extending between the inlet and outlet ports of the pump at opposite sides respectively of the pump axis have curvatures such that the in stantaneous distance R₂ of the point of contact of one of the sealing rollers or vanes with the cam surface from the axis of rotation of the rotor is given by R₂
