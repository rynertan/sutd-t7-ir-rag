# JOINTING FABRICS

## Abstract
A tape 1 comprising a fibrous reinforcement, a layer of adhesive which can be activated by heat and a strip of metallic foil is heated by the passage of an electric current through the foil so as to activate the adhesive and is then pressed into contact with two pieces of fabric to be joined. The electric current passes along two conductors 4 from a power unit 3 supplied by a source 2 and is caused to flow for a length of time which is controlled in accordance with the average temperature reached by the foil as computed by a micro processor 8 from the variation of its electrical resist ance derived from the potential drop across its ends for a predetermined current flow, tapped off by conductors 5. When the average temperature approaches a value corres ponding to full activation of the adhesive, an indication is provided to the operator by an indicator 9 and then, after an interval of time sufficient to allow the operator to press the tape against the loint between the two pieces of fabric, as measured by a timer 10, the current is automatically switched off by the microprocessor 8.
