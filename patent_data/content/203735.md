# A clutch and release bearing assembly.

## Abstract
The assembly includes a first sleeve 20 connected to a re leasing mechanism 14 of a clutch 10 and having a screw threaded surface. A second sleeve 40 is movable relative to the first sleeve 20 and is operatively connectable to a release mem ber 8. A collar 31 is in threaded engagement with the first sleeve 20 and clutch release forces are transmitted through the collar from the second sleeve to the first sleeve. The collar is prevented from rotating relative to the first sleeve during clutch release. An abutment 16 is provided on the clutch for releasing the collar 31 when the second sleeve 40 reaches a predeter mined position to allow the collar to rotate and allow the sleeve 20 to move axially relative to the second sleeve 40. A spring 19 for urging the second sleeve 40 towards the clutch 10 acts between the second sleeve 40 and part of the abutment 16 on the clutch. A locking ring 25 may be provided for locking the collar 31 to the second sleeve 40 during clutch release.
