# Compositions of melt processable polymers having improved processibility, and method of processing.

## Abstract
A melt processable composition comprising at least one polymer capable of forming an anisotropic melt and at least one other melt processable polymer characterised in that the temperature range over which the polymer can form an anisotropic melt overlaps the temperature range over which the melt processable polymer may be melt pro cessed. The melt viscosity of such compositions may be very much less than that of the melt processable polymer in the absence of the anisotropic melt forming polymer particularly at high shear rates, corresponding to those encountered during moulding and extrusion operations.
