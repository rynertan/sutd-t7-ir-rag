# Reconstituted tobacco processing.

## Abstract
A method for increasing the filling power of sheet or shredded reconstituted tobacco which is normally not sus ceptible to conventional expansion techniques is provided. Reconstituted tobacco having a uniform moisture content of 15 to 50 weight percent is heated to a temperature above about 90 C for a period of time beyond that required to drive off substantially all moisture and then is reordered. Heating may be effected in a convection or microwave oven or a drying tower. By means of the method, the tobacco is stiffened whereby a substantially irreversible filling power increase is effected.
