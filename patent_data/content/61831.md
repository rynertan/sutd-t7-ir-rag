# Improvements in or relating to stripline antennas.

## Abstract
European Patent Application No 79301340.1 Publication No 0007222 describes stripline antenna arrays in which the strip turns through successive right angle corners to form successive four cornered cells, the lengths of the longitudin al and transverse strip sections being such that the summed radiation in each cell has the same polarisation direction, viz vertical, horizontal or circular, radiating in the broadside direction. The present disclosure extends this concept to arbitrary polarisation directions radiating in any direction in the plane x z normal to the array which contains the array axis, by using cells having six potential right angle corner sites 1 6 and strip sections of appropriate lengths s, d, p, L . The number of actual corners may reduce to four eg where strip section lengths reduce to zero, as in the particular arrays described in the aforesaid European Patent Applica tion.
