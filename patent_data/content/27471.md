# HIGH FREQUENCY HEATING DEVICE.

## Abstract
High Frequency heating device of an induction heating type combined with a radiant heat source. The device includes a group of leakage wave guides arrayed in parallel, each of which has openings, in the form of long slits or stepping stones for emitting electric waves, in at least one side wall thereof. The openings for emitting electric waves are sealed with heat proof non metallic material such as teflon, glass or the like and a heating medium such as hot air, steam is passed through the wave guides. Since the foregoing arrangement allows an object to be heated to sufficiently consume heating energy, heating speed is improved and usable space in a heating chamber is increased.
