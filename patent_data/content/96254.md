# Fluid reservoir with fluid level sensor.

## Abstract
A fluid reservoir with a fluid level sensor 9 includes a manual testing device consisting of two separate but cooper ative rods 14, 19 . The fluid level sensor 9 consists of a float 6 within the reservoir 3 and a lead switch which is closed to generate a low level alarm when the float is lower than a predetermined level. The testing device serves to depress the float 6 to below that level to ensure that the switch and the alarm are working. A first rod 14 is supported by a filter mounted at the top of the reservoir. A second rod 19 is supported by a flexible cover 20 which fits over the top of the reservoir. The rods 14, 19 are coaxial and free to move downward far enough to push the float 6 to below the above level. Having the two rods separable allows the cover 16 to be removed easily without damaging the manual testing device.
