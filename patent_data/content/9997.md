# Hydraulically actuated cone clutch.

## Abstract
An hydraulic clutch 10 is provided, which is positively engaged by hydraulic means 37, 39 and is disengaged by mechanical means 49 . As shown in Fig. 2, the clutch includes a male cone member 52 carried for rotation on an input shaft 16 , and for limited axial sliding movement therealong. Interconnection between the male cone member and the input shaft is provided by a series of elongated pins 60 carried in recesses 61, 62 formed in the male cone member 52 and in the input shaft 16 . A female cone member 50 , formed integrally with an output shaft 26 , receives the male cone member 52 for driving engagement. When engagement is desired, a fluid pres sure piston 39 and a thrust plate 44 urge the male cone member 52 axially along the input shaft 16 into driving engagement with the female cone member 50 . A stop pin 46 carried by the thrust plate 44 engages an abutment for limiting the axial motion of the hydraulic piston 39 and male cone member 52 . When disengagement is desired, fluid pressure is released, and a resilient mechani cal device such as a set of springs 70 urges the male cone member 52 out of engagment with the female cone member 50 . A second mechanical device such as an addi tional set of springs 49 returns the thrust plate 44 and piston 39 to their deactivated positions.
