# Heating cable having radiation grafted jacket.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of radiation grafting a shape retaining jacket 32 made from an elastomeric polyurethane to an olefinic semi conductive composition 30 electrically interconnecting at least two elongate spaced apart conduc tors 28 to provide an improved, flexible, elongate semi conductive heating cable 8 that is provided with improved mechanical and electrical integrity and diminished imperfec tions and improved handling characteristics by reason of a substantially improved bond between the jacket 32 and the olefinic semi conductive composition 30 arising from radia tion grafting in a process that includes a means 14 of oxidizing the outer surface of the semi conductive composi tion 30 in combination with application of vacuum able to draw the jacket 32 against the semi conductive composi tion 30 within not more than about one and one half inches from the exit 26 of a die head 4 through which the product 6 is passed.
