# Quinolones having antihypertensive activity.

## Abstract
Quinolines with antihypertensive activity have the general formula I, CHEM wherein X is the residue of an optionally substituted benzene ring R is lower alkyl R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are hydrogen, lower alkyl, or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a 5 to 7 membered saturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing an additional hetero atom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur and optionally substituted by 1 or more lower alkyl groups and the dotted line between positions 2 and 3 of the quinolone nucleus represents an optional bond. The compounds are useful as antihypertensive agents. They are also indicated for use in treating heart failure and ischaemic heart disease. With the exception of the three compounds 1 methyl 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 3 sulphonamide, 1,N dimethyl 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 3 sulphonamide and 6,7 dimethoxyl methyl 4 oxo 1,4 dihydroquinoline 3 sulphonamide, the quinolones of formula I are novel. Pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of formula I are described. Processes for preparing the novel quinolones are also described.
