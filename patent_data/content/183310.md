# Apparatus for centring, aligning and clamping an optical disc.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device 27 for centring, aligning and clamping a rigid optical disc 29 in an operating position on a disc drive unit, which disc has a centre hole 89 which is bounded by a wall 87 . The device comprises rotatable drive spindle 57 with a centring device 63 which is situated near a free end 59 of the drive spindle and which comprises a plurality of radially movable centring members 65 which are pivotally connected to the drive spindle and which each comprise at least one centring surface 65b which centring surfaces are pressed against said wall of the disc in the operating position of the disc. The centring members each comprise a radial limb 73 which cooperates at one end with a sliding bush 75 which concentrically surrounds the drive spindle and actuating means 83 are provided for axially sliding the sliding bush from a first position, in which the centring members are in an operating position to centre and clamp the disc, to a second position in which the centring members are in a release position in which the centring surfaces are more inwardly located to permit mounting or removal of the disc. Further, resilient means 77 are provided for returning the sliding bush from the second to the first position and for moving the centring members from their release position to their operating position.
