## Abstract
A system for quickly indicating changes in density of a flow of material 13 using a radioactive source 14 and detec tor 15 where the count rate indicative of density is processed for sensing significant changes in the density in the flow of material as distinguished from random changes and for pro ducing an indication of such changes. In one aspect of the invention, a time filter is utilized with an RC circuit and diodes to require a count rate indicative of a significant density cha nge before producing an indication. In another aspect of the present invention the count rate is processed with respect to a predetermined formulation to determine the occurrence of a significant density change in a time frame and for producing an indication when such change occurs.
