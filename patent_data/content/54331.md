# Structural genes encoding the various allelic and maturation forms of preprothaumatin and mutations thereof, recombinant cloning vehicles comprising said structural genes and expression thereof in transformed microbial host cells.

## Abstract
The invention relates to structural genes encoding non processed and partly processed thaumatin, to the various allelic forms of said non processed thaumatin and to recombinant DNA s and plamids comprising said structural genes coding for the various allelic forms of preprothauma tin, and naturally and or artificially modified preprothauma tin in various stages of its natural processing, and to the use of said recombinant plasmids to transform microorganisms, particularly bacteria in which said genes are expressed.
