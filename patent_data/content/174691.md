# Ionisation chamber.

## Abstract
To enable an ionisation chamber used for measuring the intensity of a beam of ionising radiation, for example an electron beam produced by a linear accelerator and used for radiotherapy, both to give an output signal which is indepen dent of ambient pressure and temperature and to present a low weight of scattering material per unit area to the beam, the chamber is of flexible construction so that the volume of gas in it adapts to ambient pressure and temperature and such that the weight of gas in the active region between the electrodes per unit area remains substantially constant. Suitably, the electrodes are conductive layers on flexible plastics sheets 1, 2 , an outer annular portion 6 of one sheet 2 providing a flexible connection between two opposed chamber wall portions which remain substantially planar and parallel the proportional change ΔV₁ V₁ in a volume bounded by the opposed wall portions and including the active region equals the proportional change ΔV₂V₂ in the remainder V₂ of the internal volume.
