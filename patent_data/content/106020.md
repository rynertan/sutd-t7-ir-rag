# Line locked digital fluorography system.

## Abstract
In a digital fluorography system a television TV camera converts x ray images to analog video signals that are convert ed to digital pixel words in an analog to digital converter ADC . The sync signals for the TV camera and the sample clock signals for the ADC are derived from a novel resettable crystal controlled sync generator. A phase locked loop pro vides an ac reference signal at one half power line frequency which is equivalent to TV frame rate. The sync generator is res et to start a new frame and an ensuing sequence of crystal controlled horizontal sync pulses only in response to occur rence of ac reference signals so every frame is in registration. A digital video procesor DVP substracts a mask image from each image in a sequence of images that are acquired while an x ray contrast medium is appearing in and disappearing from a blood vessel. The resulting difference images are stored in an alog video signal format in an analog video disk recorder. The DVP and, hence the horizontal and vertical sync signals re corded on disk for each frame are also locked to the ac refer ence signal and are independent of sync signals from the crys tal controlled oscillator. A novel digital storage FIFO buffer sys tem couples the digitized pixel data from the ADC to the DVP and compensates for the timing differences between them. During image reprocessing wherein recorded difference im ages are subtracted from a selected difference or substitute mask image, the sample clock for the ADC is derived from a phase locked loop that is locked to the recorded horizontal sync signals so the sample clock is varied in correspondence with or modulated by the recorded sync signals.
