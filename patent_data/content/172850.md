## Description
The invention relates to an apparatus for coupling a male member to a female member as defined in the introductory part of claim 1. An apparatus of this type has become known from US A 2485799. In this known apparatus the wedges and wedge actuator means are located in the female member, while the reaction surface means are located in the shank portion of the male member. This arrangement results in a relatively complicated shape of the wedges which are of a substantially arcuate cross section in order to enable them to simultaneously engage the wedge actuator means and the reaction surface means. Furthermore, key means are required to retain the wedges in the female member. Since the wedge sliding surfaces and the interengaging surfaces of the wedges and the wedge actuator means are freely accessible from the outside, they are not protected against dirt or other contaminants. Quick connect disconnect coupling arrangements of another type are known wherein a cone shaped member, e.g. a cone point screw, is carried by one of the members and engages a corresponding conical surface in the other member along a line contact to generate coupling forces parallel to a longitudinal axis common to the two members. One example of such known arrrangements is found in US A 3923414. Another example is shown in a commercially available arrangement described in a brochure designated KOMET ABS 1 83 WA 10 published by Komet R.B., Inc., Rolling Meadows, Illinois. A quick connect disconnect coupling arrangement of a still further type has become known from DE B 14 02 301. In this arrangement three circumferentially spaced pins having wedge shaped ends are located in a pilot portion of the male member, while reaction surface means is located in the female member shank portion, with the wedge pins being moved outwardly from the axis to effect coupling and inwardly toward the axis to release coupling between the male and female members. Three circumferentially spaced indexing pins in parallel relationship to the wedge pins are provided for positioning the male member relative to the female member before the wedging surfaces engage the reaction surface means. When the wedging surfaces are moved into engagement with the reaction surface means, the female member is urged against the indexing pins to provide a clamping action. Such known prior art arrangements do not offer maximum coupling strength in that they rely on a line contact between the two members in generating the coupling force. Also, such arrangements have the disadvantage of not offering a positive disconnect or uncoupling action i.e. the parts used to effect coupling may, especially with prolonged usage in attendant wear, stick or hang up when the coupling is attempted to be loosened. It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for coupling a male member to a female member, which will generate coupling forces between interacting surface areas rather than by line contact between coacting coupling portions, and which is of simplified structure. The invention solving this object is defined in claim 1. The objects and features of the invention will become apparent from a reading of a detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawing in which It is to be noted that in the various views of the drawing the same components or portions of the apparatus disclosed are designated by identical reference numerals in each of the figures. With reference to Figs. 1 4, male member 100 comprises in this exemplary embodiment a boring bar nose carrying cutting cartridge 151 which in turn carries a cutting element or insert 152. Male member 100 includes a pilot portion 101 of smaller cross sectional area or diameter than that of the main shank of the boring nose. Female member 110, for example an extension adaptor suitable for mounting to the spindle of the machine tool, includes a pilot receiving bore or cavity 112 shaped for mating receipt of pilot portion 101 of male member 100. Rearward of the pilot receiving bore 112, member 110 includes an adaptor with an industry standard taper shank 120 for suitable mounting to the spindle of the machine tool. To assure the proper angular position of the cutting element 152 when members 100 and 110 are in the coupled condition, an alignment key 160 is bolted to the peripheral surface of the shank of male member 100 via key mounting bolt 161. A mating keyway 114 is formed in the peripheral surface of the shank of female member 110 for receipt of alignment key 160. Key 160 additionally provides the function of a back up drive element between member 100 and 110. Pilot portion 101 of male member 100 includes a wedge housing slot 102 extending through pilot portion 101 substantially normal to the common longitudinal axis 170 of the coupled members 100 and 110. Slideably received in slot 102 are a first wedge 131 and a second wedge 132, each threadingly coupled to an actuator element comprising in this embodiment differential screw 130. Differential screw 130 has a first threaded portion 135 threaded in a first sense and a second portion 136 threaded in an opposite sense respectively threadingly coupled to appropriately threaded bores in wedges 131 and 132. Retention pin 140 is housed in a bore passing through pilot portion 101 transverse to axis 170 and intersecting wedge housing slot 102 in a manner such that wedges 131 and 132 and screw 130, when threadingly coupled, are slideably retained in housing slot 102 even when male member 100 is completely disconnected from female member 110. Formed about the periphery of pilot receiving bore 112 of female member 110 is an annular wedge receiving cavity 115 extending about longitudinal axis 170. Cavity 115 includes an annular sloping reaction surface 111 which, when pilot portion 101 of male member 100 is inserted into cavity 112, will confront mating wedging surface 133 of wedge 131 and wedging surface 134 of wedge 132. In the embodiment of Figs. 1 4 surfaces 111, 133 and 134 are conical. However, any type surface, e.g. planar, may be employed in accordance with the invention. An access bore or port 172 extends radially from the outer surface of the shank of female member 110 inwardly to intersect wedge receiving cavity 115 of the pilot receiving bore 112 to provide access to an end of differential screw 130 by a suitable driving element 171. Preferably a second access port not shown is provided diametrically opposite port 172 such that either end of differential screw 130 may be accessed by a driving element. One such suitable driving element is a hexagonal wrench for insertion in an appropriately shaped hexagonal cavity 113 in either end of actuator screw 130. An alternative to annular wedge receiving cavity 115 and associated annular reaction surface 111 would be to provide separate distinct slots or windows for receipt of wedges of 131 and 132. Such slots would be appropriately positioned for receipt of the two wedging elements and each would include its own reaction surface for interacting with wedging surfaces 133 and 134 of wedges 131 and 132, respectively. Such an alternative approach would be particularly suited to applications involving very large diameter members 100 and 110 and would offer the advantage that less material would have to be removed from the body of female member 110 s shank. Additionally, it may be found more economical to mill out planar reaction surfaces for engagement by corresponding planar wedging surfaces on the wedges in this alternative approach. With the apparatus as above described, members 100 and 110 are coupled and uncoupled as follows. Pilot portion 101 of male member 100 is inserted into pilot receiving cavity 112 of member 110 in an appropriate radial position as determined by the mating engagement between key 160 and keyway 114. A driving element 171 such as a hexagonal wrench is then inserted through access port 172 to engage one end of differential screw 130. Turning driving element 171 will, in turn, cause differential screw 130 to rotate thereby moving in simultaneous fashion wedges 131 and 132 radially outwardly from longitudinal axis 170, in turn, causing wedging surfaces 133 and 134 to bear against reaction surface 111 of female member 110. Such interaction between surfaces 133, 134 and surface 111 generate axial forces parallel to axis 170 thereby drawing male member 100 and female member 110 into a rigidly coupled configuration. Since the wedges screw assembly floats in the wedge housing slot 102 in pilot portion 101, wedges 131 and 132 tend to be self centering while coupling is being effected and provide equal coupling force on both sides of axis 170. Such equal distribution of force leads to a stable connection between members 100 and 110. Rotation of driving element 170 in an opposite direction will cause differential screw 130 to positively retract wedges 131 and 132 radially inwardly towards axis 170 thereby releasing the connection. With reference to Fig. 5, a perspective view of a wedge 131 suitable for use in accordance with the principles of the invention is set forth. Wedge 131 includes threaded hole 137 for receipt of actuator screw 130. Wedging surface 133 is ground to substantially achieve surface contact with reaction surface 111 of Figs. 1 4. By appropriately shaping surface 133 in accordance with the principles of the invention, surface contact rather than line contact is established between the wedging elements and the reaction surface of the receiving member. With reference to Fig. 6, an alternative embodiment is set forth wherein the pilot extension 601 of male member 600 comprise a relieved portion 601a of smaller cross sectional diameter joined to a larger pilot portion 601b. Relieved portion 601a includes an appropriate wedge receiving slot for carrying the wedges, one of which, 631, is shown, along with actuator screw 630 having hex cavity 613 formed in the end thereof. Male member 600 includes a locator key 660 which is received in mating keyway 614 of female member 610. Pilot portions 601a and 601b are received in a pilot receiving bore 612 of female member 610. Surrounding pilot receiving bore 612 is reaction surface 611. Access port 615 is provided through the shank female member 614 for appropriate access by a driving element to the end of actuator screw 630 at its hex cavity 613. With this arrangement of the pilot portion, relieved portion 601 a allows for easier sliding fit between male member 600 and female member 610 prior to the initiation of lockup. Prototype coupling arrangements built in accordance with the disclosed invention have demonstrated excellent results. For example, male and female members, each two feet in length, were coupled axially together using the above arrangement and demonstrated a very reliable and repeatable rigid connection with minimal runout on the order of three ten thousandths of an inch. One surprising experimental result was evidenced by the fact that a solid four foot section of bar was measured to have a sag of four thousandths of an inch compared to two two feet coupled sections demonstrating only on the order of one and one half thousandths of an inch sag between centers. Experimental boring applications under relatively heavy cutting conditions have demonstrated that the rigidity of the coupling attained with apparatus designed in accordance with the disclosed invention has been highly satisfactory.
