# APPARATUS FOR HORIZONTALLY AND INTERMITTENTLY DRAWING OUT CAST STEEL PIECE FROM HORIZONTAL MOLD OF HORIZONTAL CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE.

## Abstract
Apparatus for horizontally and intermittantly drawing out a cast steel piece 1 from a horizontal mold of a horizontal continuous casting machine in a plurality of cycles each consisting of a drawing operation continuing for a predetermined period of time, suspension of the drawing operation for a predetermined period of time and a push back operation for a predetermined period of time. The apparatus comprises at least a pair of friction feed rollers 2A, 2B 3A, 3B a driving device 4 for driving the pair of friction feed rollers 2A, 2B 3A, 3B and a damping means 12 including a hydraulic damping device 13 which is driven in interlocked relation to the driving device 4 , and a throttle valve for restricting the flow rate of oil flowing out from the hydraulic damping device 13 while the cast steel piece 1 is being drawn out. While the cast steel piece 1 is being drawn out from the horizontal mold, the damping means 12 applies to the driving device 4 a damping force which is proportional to the number of revolutions of the driving device 4 , whereby the cast steel piece 1 is prevented from being drawn out from the horizontal mold beyond the above described predetermined period of time.
