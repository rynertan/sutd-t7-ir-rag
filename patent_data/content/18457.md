# Labelling equipment.

## Abstract
Labelling equipment for applying wrap around labels to cylindrical containers, e.g. bottles 50 . The equipment includes a label carrier 36 having a wheel 119 rotatable about its axis, a vacuum system 140, 142 coupled to the wheel to retain labels e.g. 44 on the wheel, a feeder 34 for directing containers individually to the wheel adjacent the periphery of the wheel to receive a label, and a drive system 38 for receiving containers from the container feeder and for rolling the containers upon receiving the label from the label carrier. The drive system includes at least one belt 128 engaged about the wheel 119 in slipping relationship there with to permit the belt to move faster than the periphery of the wheel and including a portion for moving in contact with the container 50 immediately after the container leaves the feeder to both carry the label 48 off the wheel and to engage it on the container. A cutter arrangement 40 is provided with a lobe 95 which removes tension from the label 129 as it is severed from the strip of labels.
