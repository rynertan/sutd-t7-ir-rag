# Electronic circuit for the control of refrigerating apparatus.

## Abstract
An electronic delay circuit is described, for refrigerator apparatus which has at least two cooling compartments at different temperatures, each of which is cooled by an evaporator traversed by the refrigerant fluid one for fresh foods and one for frozen foods , a single compressor, a single condensor and a system of capillary tubes. The said electronic control circuit serves to inhibit attempts to restart the compressor, after it has stopped for whatever reason whilst the conditions remain non optimal. More particularly, it avoids attempts to restart the compressor whilst the pressures of the refrigerant fluid in the delivery and induc tion ducts of the compressor are not in equilibrium and or if a PTC is used in the starter circuit of the electric motor, with the said PTC still hot. The said electronic control circuit even allows the requirement for a starter capacitor to be elimin ated. This delay is obtained by discharging a capacitor which is charged during the operating time of the compressor through a resistor the charged condition of the capacitor after the compressor has stopped in fact prevents the commutation of a threshold voltage comparator circuit which is responsible for enabling a new start up of the motor of the compressor. The values of the said capacitor and of the charging and discharging resistors are chosen in such a way that the voltage across the said capactor has substantial ly, instant by instant, the same variation as the pressure in the condenser of the refrigerator circuit.

## Description
ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT FOR THE CONTROL OF REFRIGERATING APPARATUS.The present invention relates to an electronic circuit for the control of refrigerating apparatus comprising at least two cooling compartments having different temperatures, each of which is cooled by an evaporator traversed by a refrigerant fluid and one of which is associated with fresh foods and one with frozen foods, a compressor for compressing the refrigerant fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrigerant fluid coming from the compressor, a system of capillary tubing for carrying the refrigerant fluid from the condenser to the evaporators, and in which the two cooling compartments operate substantially independently of one another.Combined or two door refrigerators with two cooling compartments, one for fresh foods and one for frozen foods, and a single compressor are known. It is also known that one of the characteristics most desired in this type of apparatus is independent operation of the two cooling compartments. One way of obtaining this object is by putting the evaporators of the two compartments in series or in parallel and by controlling them, by means of solenoid valves, in such a way that the refrigerant fluid circulates in both the evaporators or in only one of these depending on whether it is desired to cool both the compartments or only one of these. Independent control of the two compartments is obtained by means of independent thermostats one fitted in the frozen food compartment and one in the fresh food compartment.In this way, therefore, both the cooling compartments, independently from one another, can require the compressor to start or stop and this type of operation involves disadvantages in the functioning of the com pressor. In fact it is possible that soon after one of the two compartments has reached the desired tem perature, and therefore has made the compressor stop, the other compartment requires cooling and therefore would wish to make the compressor start up again.The said compressor, therefore, having just terminated one cycle, has refrigerant fluid at low pressure in the inlet duct and refrigerant fluid at high pressure in the output duct, and given that it is driven by a single phase electric induction motor which h a low starting torque, does not succeed in starting up again. Until now the problem has been resolved by mounting a starting capacitor in series with the starter winding, which by increasing the phase displacement between the currents which flow in the starter and main windings, increases the starting torque of the electric motor by 50 60 thereby allowing the compressor to start up.But even this solution has its disadvantages, because the said capacitor is of the electrolytic type which involves significant tolerances, has poor reliability in fact they can blow up rather easily and finally the cost is not insignificant.Moreover in motors the main winding of which is controlled by a resistor with a positive temperature coefficient PTC , it is necessary to take account of another problem. When it is first supplied the current flows both in the main winding and in the starter wind ing, in series with which latter the positive temperature coefficient resistor PTC is located. The current by flowing in both the said windings, allows the electric motor to start, but simultaneously heats the PTC and this latter experiences a large increase in its resistance and impedes the further passage of current in the starter winding. In this way, after starting, the starter winding is effectively excluded because of the continuous flow of current which maintains the PTC hot.If, however, soon after it has stopped the compressor were to attempt to restart again, the PTC would still be bot and the starter circuit would remain always open so that the compressor would not be able to start up again.The same disadvantage obtains if the compressor should not succeed in starting since, in fact, in this case also, the PTC would be heated and subsequent attempts to start would find the starter circuit always open.Therefore, the subject of the present invention is that of overcoming the above mentioned disadvantages and of providing an electronic circuit which functions, after the compressor has stopped, to prevent it from restarting for a time such as to permit the equilibrium conditions of pressure in the inlet and outlet ducts of the compressor itself to be re established, and to allow the PTC , if one is used, time to cool completely in such a way that the starting torque of the electric motor, with the pressures balanced, will be sufficient to start the compressor, and in the case of starting with a PTC , this latter having had time to cool, allows the current to flow in the starter winding.Further objects of the present invention are those of ensuring that the windings of the electric motor are not subjected to current overloads, and therefore to a high temperature, which could damage them, and to ensure that this electronic circuit will be reliable and of low cost.To achieve these objects the subject of the present invention is an electronic circuit for the control of refrigerator apparatus comprising at least two cooling compartments at different temperatures, each of which is cooled by an evaporator traversed by a refrigerant fluid and one of which is associated with fresh food and one with frozen foods, a compressor for compressing the refrigerant fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrigerant fluid coming from the compressor, a system of capillary tubing for carrying the refrigerant fluid from the condenser to the evaporators, and in which the operation of the two cooling compartments is substantially independent, characterised by the fact that for ensuring that after the compressor has stopped a predetermined delay occurs before the compressor is started up again, the length of this delay being such as to allow the equilibrium between the pressures of the refrigerant fluid in the delivery duct and the intake duct of the compressor itself to be re established, there are provided timer means of analogue type which enables a switching circuit to maintain the drive circuit of the compressor motor in an inhibited condition for the duration of the predetermined delay.Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become clearly apparent from the detailed description which follows and from the attached drawings given purely by way of explanatory and non limitative example, in which Figure 1 is a diagram of the electronic control circuit forming the subject of the present invention Figure 2 illustrates the driving arrangement for the electric motor of a compressor of a refrigerator, according to the invention Figure 3 illustrates the driving arrangement of an electric motor for a compressor, in a second embodiment of the present invention andFigure 4 illustrates the variation of the resistance of a resistor of the 11PTC11 type as a function of time in the cooling phase, such resistor being utilised in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 3. With reference to Figure 1 there can be seen a positive supply terminal VCC to which is connected one terminal of a resistor R3 the other terminal of which is connected to the non inverting input of a threshold comparator CS and a terminal of a resistor R4 the other terminal of which is earthed. To the inverting input of the threshold comparator CS there are connected one terminal of a resistor R2, the other terminal of which is earthed, one terminal of a capacitor C1 the other terminal of which is earthed, and the cathode of a diode D1 the anode of which is connected to one side of a resistor R1.The other side of the resistor R1 is connected to the collector of a PNP transistor Q1 the emitter of which is connected to the supply Vcc, whilst the base is connected to one side of a resistor R6 the other side of which is connected to the output Q of a flip flop of the setreset type indicated FF.The output of the threshold comparator CS is connected to one side of a resistor R 5 the other side of which is connected to the supply VCCJ and the set input of the flip flop FF.To the output Q of the flip flop FF there is also connected one terminal of a resistor R8 the other side of which is connected to the base of an NPN transistorQ2. The emitter of the transistor Q2 is connected to earth whilst the collector is connected to one side of a relay coil RL the other side of which is connected to the supply Vcc, and to the anode of the diodeD2 the cathode of which is also connected to the supply VCC. To the reset input of the flip flop FF there are connected one terminal of a resistor R7 the other terminal of which is earthed, and the output of an CR gate. To the a input of the OR gate there is supplied a positive signal for the whole of the time that, for any reason, the switch sensitive to the temperature and or to the current of the refrigerator on which the electronic control circuit is fitted, interrupts the supply circuit of the electric motor, the input buzz receives a positive signal for the whole of the time that the compressor of the refrigerator is stopped because it has finished a cooling cycle, whilst the input c is fed via a capacitor C2 which is connected between this input and the supply VCC to provide a positive signal whenever the refrigerator is plugged in to the mains.With reference to Figure 2 where the drive arrangement of the compressor motor of a refrigerator suitable to be associated with the electronic control circuit illustrated in Figure 1 is shown, there can be seen a thermostat 3 mechanical or electronic of the refrigerator apparatus, which has one contact connected to the network supply terminal 1 and the other contact connected to one terminal of the excitation coil of a starter relay 8 and to a normally open contact of the same relay 8.The other terminal of the relay coil 8 is connected to one end of the main winding 6 of a single phase induction motor the other end of which is connected to one end of the starter winding 5 of the same electric motor and to one end of a switch 7 sensitive to current and temperature overloads, the other terminal of which is connected to one of the contacts of the relay RL which is the same as in the electronic control circuit shown inFigure 1, the other contact of which is connected to the other terminal of the network supply 2. The other end of the starter winding 5 is connected to the other contact of the starter relay 8.For a good understanding of the operation of the electronic control circuit shown in Figure 1 it is necessary also to make reference to the drive arrange ment of Figure 2.Starting from the condition that the compressor of the refrigerator apparatus on which the electronic control circuit is mounted is in operation. In these conditions the output Q of the flip flop FF is low, the transistor Q2 is non conducting the relay Rt is not excited and given that it has normally closed contacts it allows the supply to pass to the compressor.The transistor Q1 on the other hand conducts and the capacitor C1 is charged through the resistor R1 and the diode D1 with a time constant R1x C1 which in the illustrated embodiment is in the region of 0.18 seconds .When the compressor stops, because it has terminated a cooling cycle , reset signal reaches the flip flop FF through the logic OR gate. The terminal Q becomes high, the transistor Q2 conducts, the relay RL becomes excited and its contacts open preventing the compressor from restarting even if the thermostat should, immediately after a stop, arrive at a new request in this sense. Simultaneously the transistorQ1 ceases to conduct and the capacitor C1 starts to discharge through the resistor R2 with a time constantR2xC1 which in the embodiment illustrated is in the region of 50 seconds .The voltage at the inverting input of the threshold comparator CS starts to fall until after a time equal to about 5xR2xC1 in our case about 4 minutes it reaches the voltage set on the non inverting terminal of the same comparatorCS by the voltage divider R3, R4. At this point the output of the said threshold comparator CS becomes high and the flip flop FF is sent a set input which makes its output Ç go low again turning off the trans istor Q2. This causes closure of the contacts of the relay RL consequently enabling the motor to start up again if the thermostat circuit requires it.In conclusion, from the moment that the flip flop FF receives its reset signal which opens the contacts of the relay RL a time of at least about sxR2xC1 seconds must pass before the compressor is enabled to start up again. This charging and discharging of the capacitor C1 with the two different time constants simulates the variation of the pressure of refrigerant fluid in the condenser of the refrigerator apparatus, and therefore with a suitable choice of the values of R2 and C1 a time delay 5XR2xC1 which corresponds to the time necessary to re establish the equilibrium between the pressures in the delivery duct and the induction duct of the compressor can be set. We have said that a reset at the flip flop FF prevents the compressor from starting up again for a time 5xR2xC1 so that, to obtain further advantages, it is arranged that such reset can also arrive from the switch 7 sensitive to overloads in the temperature and or the current and from the network supply.The continuous supply VCC is obtained by means of a supply device connected to the mains such that each time the apparatus is plugged in, a reset signal reaches the flip flop FF through the capacitor C2 and the AR gate.This means that each time that the plug is inserted into the main supply the electronic circuit, before starting the compressor, checks that the capacitorC1 is discharged and this gives the advantage that in the case of insertion, removal and re insertion of the plug a thing which quite soften happens both because of erroneous actions by the user and because of faulty contact the compressor will not find itself in the critical conditions described above of having to restart immediately after it has stopped.The reset signal which arrives from the switch 7 sensitive to overloads in temperature and or current via the OR gate, when these are open, serves to ensure that even in the case of a faulty start or an accidental stop for mechanical or thermal reasons, the restarting of the compressor will be delayed by the time 5xR2xC1, given that even in this case without the delay time the compressor would have to restart immediately after it has stopped.Moreover, it also serve in the case where a positive temperature coefficient resistor is used for starting the electric motor, to give this e ment time to cool completely, but to better understand the importance of this observation reference will be made to Figures 3 and 4.In Figure 3, where the same components as in Figure 2 are indicated with the same reference numerals, there can be seen a mains supply terminal 1 connected to a thermostat contact 3 mechanical or electronic of the refrigerator apparatus. The other contact of the thermostat 3 is connected to one side of a resistor having a positive temperature coefficient PCT 4, the other terminal of which is connected to one end of the starter winding 5 of a single phase induction motor, and to one end of the main winding 6 of the same electric motor.The two other ends of the starter winding and the main winding are both connected to one end of a switch 7 sensitive to overloads in the temperature and or currents, the other end of which is connected to one of the contacts of a relay which is the same as in the electronic delay circuit illustrated in Figure 1 the other contact, in turn, is connected to the other terminal of the mains supply 2.Finally, in Figure 4 there is shown the variation of the resistance of the PCT as a function of cooling time that is to say, the instant T O on the abcissa axis represents the moment when the compressor stops because it has finished a cooling cycle and therefore no more current passes in the PCT. As will be appreciated the graph has been truncated to facilitate the illustration, given that the beginning of the curve is shown to start only after more than a minute from the extinguishing time has passed. The numbers show the values which this resistance assumes in the preceding instants.As already said, in Figure 2 there is shown an application of the electronic control circuit which solves all the operating problems of the compressor for this type of configuration of starter circuit for the electric motor.This configuration also permits protection of the integrity of the electric motor to be obtained both in the case of high temperatures of the motor windings and of current overloads in these windings for a time greater than 0.5 seconds. However, the said configuration has the disadvantage that the starter relay 8 requires calibration for each compressor used and, moreover, the cost of this starter relay 8 is not insignificant. For this reason the adoption of other starting solutions for electric motors which drive compressors have entered into use, which will obviate these disadvantages.One of these uses a resistor with a positive temperature coefficient 1,PTC1, in the starter circuit. ThePTC costs less than the relay and moreover works well for all compressors, but also has various disadvantages.In fact, in this case, it is common practice for the switch 7 sensitive to overloads in the temperature and or currents, given that it is traversed only by the op erating current, is connected within the motor with all the problems that this involves, that is to say it must be hermetically sealed against the refrigerant fluid, it must be mounted together with the motor, it must be very reliable, etc. and moreover this type of switch also has to have dimensions less than those used in the systems of Figure 2 and of the bi metal type and is primarily sensitive to excess temperature.Consequently the system of protection is very slow, in fact in the case of extended current overloads the electric motor is not started or is stopped for some mechanical or thermal impediment before the said t v perature sensitive switch opens the circuit it is necessary to wait for the main winding of the motor to heat by the rbule effect until it reaches a temperature of about 1400, and before the circuit is closed again it is necessary to wait for the temperature of the said winding to fall below 1000, All these operations last for about ten minutes, and in the case of a faulty start when there is a need to cool a compartment of the refrigerator this delay is not acceptable.To resolve the problems of reliability and slowness in the response it would therefore be useful to be able to use a switch of the very quick current sensitive type and to mount it externally of the hermetically sealed container of the electric motor.This solution too, however, without the electronic control circuit, would not work well in the case of a faulty start because in this case the said current sensitve switch would open and close quickly but thePTC mould not have time to cool so that successive attempts to restart the motor would not cause the current to circulate in the starter winding and the compressor would not be able to restart, and this situation would repeat ad infinitum given that the PTCts always being traversed by current, would remain hot preventing the compressor from restarting. In conclusion, with a very quick current sensitive switch it is necessary to leave the PTC time to cool completely before mating a new attempt to start the compressor.By looking at Figure 4 , where the variation of the resistance of the PTC as a function of cooling time is plotted, we note how after three minutes the PTC can be considered as practically cold.To all the above described situations the configuration illustrated in Figure 3 responds, which includes a PTC 4 in the starter circuit, a current sensitive switch 7 mounted externally of the casing of the electric motor and an electronic control circuit not shown, but identical to that illustrated inFigure 1 which controls the contacts of the relay R. To understand the operation of the said system we start from the condition in which the compressor is operating. In this condition both the contacts of the thermostat 3 and those of the relay R1 are closed. If the compressor stops because it has finished a cooling cycle the operation is identical to that illustrated with reference to Figure 1. If, on the other hand, the compressor stops accidentally, or else because of a faulty compressor start, the current overload in the windings of the electric motor causes the switch 7 to open which, through the OR gate, sends the reset signal to the flip flop FF.From this instant, and for a time of 5xR2xC1 seconds the contacts with the relay R2 remain open preventing any attempt to restart the compressor and giving thePTC 4 time to cool completely in such a way that upon a subsequent attempt, finding it cold, the current circulates in the starter winding allowing the compressorto start up again.In conclusion, the electronic control circuit gives time not only for the pressure of the refrigerant fluid in the delivery and induction ducts of the compressor to regain their equilibrium state, but also gives the PTC time to cool completely so that after a stop or abase start both the pressures and the PTC will be in the best condition for allowing a correct restarting of the compressor.From the above description the advantages of the electronic delay circuit constituting the subject of the present invention will be clearly apparent. In particular these include the possibility of making the pressures of the refrigerant fluid regain equilibrium between the delivery and induction ducts of the compressor after it has stopped and before a new start, allowing the use of a starter capacitor to be avoided, the possibility of being able to utilise a PTC in the starter circuit of the electric motor and a switch sensitive to excess temperature and or to current overload mounted externally of the hermetically sealed container of the electric motor itself with signficiant savings both in the cost of the components and in the labour involved, and the simplicity and reliability of the electronic circuit itself and its low cost. It is clear that numerous variations of the electronic control circuit described are possible as well as in the systems for its application, such as for example a current overload sensor positioned externally of the hermetically sealed motor container which whenever there is a current overload for a certain time for example 0.5 seconds sends a positive signal to theOR gate of the electronic control circuit, and which together with an additional excess temperature sensor positioned in thermal contact with the winding of the motor allows the elimination of the switch sensitive to excess temperature and or current overloads, or a different manner of obtaining the delay or equivalent circuit solutions without by this departing from the scope of the principles of novelty inherent in the inventive idea.
