# An M.B.B. type contact arrangement for an electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
In an M.B.B. type relay, a contact spring comprises a pair of flat spring parts 6a, 6b integral at the base of the spring and separate at their free ends, each of which cooperates with a fixed contact 3, 4 . An actuating card 20 drives both spring parts 6a, 6b in the same direction and has a stepped portion so dimensioned that a first contact formed by one of the spring parts 6a with one 3 of the fixed contacts is closed before the second contact formed by the other spring part 6b with the other fixed contact 4 is opened.
