# Apparatus and method for maintaining the permeability of paper and board machine felts.

## Abstract
A method of maintaining the permeability of felts 1 in paper board and like machines comprises the steps of monitoring the permeability of the felt 1 , and bringing into operation apparatus 5 for directing at the felt a spray of liquid for reconditioning the felt 1 , when the monitored permeabil ity monitored by means 11 reaches a first predetermined value and terminating the operation of the apparatus when the permeability reaches another second predetermined value higher than the first value.
