# Roll for continuous casting.

## Abstract
A continuous casting roll comprises a roll body 1 having a cooling water bore 9 9a coaxially therewith, and a sleeve 2 fitted around the roll body 1 and having one end fixed to the roll body 1 and the other end as a free end. The roll body 1 has a trunk portion 1a and a shaft portion 1b 1b at each end of the trunk portion. A plurality of cooling water channels 14 provided between the trunk portion 1a and the sleeve 2 extend in parallel axially thereof and have opposite ends in communication with the water bore 9 9a . The sleeve 2 is fitted around the roll body 1 by a shrink fit the interference of which decreases steadily from the fixed end toward the free end to permit free thermal deformation of the sleeve 2 toward the free end.
