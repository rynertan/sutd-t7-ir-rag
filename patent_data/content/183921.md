# SOLAR SIMULATOR

## Abstract
A solar simulator produces synthetic spectral distribu tion characteristic with sufficiently high uniformity and repeatability and permits the intensity of output light to be varied without substantially deviating the spectral distribu tion of output light. The solar simulator includes filter means 13 capable of eliminating the near infrared component from the light of a xenon short arc lamp 11 and, extracting the near infrared component from the light of an incandescent filament lamp 12 enable the two kinds of lights which are selected by the filter means 13 to be directed coaxially to an integrating optical system 14 .
