## Description
The present invention relates to an improvement in the method of positioning a beam to a specific portion of a semiconductor wafer, which is required in a semiconductor manufacturing process. In semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as an electron beam exposure and an ion implantation, it is frequently required to position a specific area with high accuracy, for example, an area to be processed, at a predetermined location on the semiconductor wafer in the semiconductor manufacturing apparatus. The recent trend in this field is to increase micro miniaturization and a high integration density of semiconductor integrated circuits. With this trend, the requirement for the positioning accuracy is more strict. A lithography apparatus is used for effecting the electron beam exposure or the optical exposure. In this apparatus, it is necessary to position the semiconductor wafer at a predetermined position required in an optical system of the apparatus. For the positioning, the positions of positioning marks, previously formed on the semiconductor wafer, are measured. The measurement results are used for obtaining a parallel movement component and a rotating movement component of the required movement of the whole semiconductor wafer. As disclosed for example in EP A 066883, to improve the positioning accuracy of the semiconductor wafer, positioning marks are arrayed for example in a matrix fashion. The positioning is made for each mark or for each chip area to be formed on the wafer. This approach can correct a dislocation of the wafer due to the distortion of the wafer caused during the manufacturing process. Types of defects of the positioning marks are classified into Use of such defective marks brings about impossible positioning or inaccurate positioning of the semiconductor wafer. For example, the defective mark of the type a makes it impossible to position the semiconductor wafer. The defective mark of the type b or c makes the positioning inaccurate. Thus, the conventional positioning method can not provide an accurate positioning of the wafer when the defective mark is contained in the positioning marks. For example, the conventional positioning method makes it difficult to provide a fine pattern on any semiconductor chip with high precision. In this respect, the conventional positioning method involves the problem to be solved before attaining semiconductor devices improved in accuracy, integration density, production yield, and uniformity in the characteristics over the wafer surface. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of positioning a beam exactly to a specific portion of a semiconductor wafer, which is required in a lithography process to manufacture semiconductor devices improved in accuracy, uniformity in characteristics, and production yield. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of positioning a beam at a specific portion of a semiconductor wafer having a plurality of positioning marks formed thereon to treat the wafer, comprising Using the same principle but in a different way, the invention also provides a method of positioning a beam at a specific portion of a semiconductor wafer having a plurality of positioning marks formed thereon to treat the wafer, some of the positioning marks being arranged in the form of a matrix on the wafer, comprising With either of these methods, it is assumed that the two predetermined positioning marks, or the two predetermined neighbouring marks, as the case may be, are not defective. When the positioning mark is not a defective mark, the mark is directly used for the wafer positioning. When the positioning mark is a defective mark, the positions of the marks around the defective mark are measured. The measured positions of the marks are used for the wafer positioning. Thus, even if defective positioning marks are contained in the marks, an accurate positioning of the semiconductor wafer is ensured, improving the positioning accuracy. Therefore, the present invention attains many useful effects. For example, electron beam exposure can be performed exactly, so that an accurate depiction of a fine pattern is possible. This greatly contributes to the improvement of integration density, accuracy, uniformity in characteristic, and production yield. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which One embodiment of the present invention may be described as follows, with reference to figures. A method of positioning a specific processed area of a semiconductor wafer at a predetermined positions is required in a semiconductor manufacturing system. In this embodiment, the present invention is applied to a positioning process for an electron beam exposure. An electron beam exposure apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is used for applying an electron beam exposure to a semiconductor wafer 5. Electron beams are emitted by an electron gun 1 and focused by electromagnetic lenses 2. The electron beams are deflected by a combination of a blanking deflection plate 3 and a scanning deflection plate 4, and are projected onto the semiconductor wafer 5 placed on a table 7. The table 7 is moved by a driver 8 in an X direction or horizontal direction on the drawing and a Y direction or an obverse and reverse direction on the drawing. The driver 8 is driven by commands issued from a computer 9. Positions of the table 7 in the X and Y directions are accurately measured by a laser interferometer system 10. The voltages applied to the deflection plates 3 and 4 are also controlled by the computer 9. The electron beams reflected by the semiconductor wafer 5 are detected by an electron detector 11. Upon receipt of the reflected electron beams, the electron detector 11 produces a signal based on the amount of the reflected electrons. The detected signal is amplified by an amplifier 12 and is converted by an A D converter 13 into a digital signal. The digital signal output from the A D converter 13 is stored in a transient memory 14. The computer 9 computes position data of a mark on the semiconductor wafer 5 using the table position based on the output signal of the laser range finder 10, the voltages applied to the deflection plates 3, which represent an amount of deflection of electron beam, and the data stored in the transient memory 14. A matrix of L shaped positioning marks are disposed on the semiconductor wafer 5, as shown in Fig. 2. Positioning marks are formed lying on dicing lines of the semiconductor chips. Those marks are formed by an anisotropic etching of silicon. The marks are numbered M1 M56 in the order shown by the direction of an arrow with a broken line for the purpose of explanation. How to apply an electron exposure to the semiconductor wafer 5 using the electron beam exposure apparatus will be described referring to Figs. 3 a and 3 b illustrating a flow chart. As a first step S1, a position of a mark M31, for example, which is properly selected from the marks M1 M56, is measured found . The position of the mark M31 is expressed in the terms of the x and y coordinates, for example. The position measurement of the mark M31 is performed in the following manner. The table 7 is moved to a position allowing the position of the mark M31 to be measured. As shown in Fig. 4, the electron beam is moved for scanning the wafer along the lines X1 31 and X2 31 and in their arrow direction. A waveform, shown in Fig. 5 a is produced by the A D converter 13 when the semiconductor wafer is scanned by the electron beam in the direction X1 31. The waveform of the output signal from the A D converter 13 when the electron beam is moved in the direction X2 31 is shown in Fig. 5 b . Midpoints in the durations of the output signals from the A D converter 13 are denoted as P1 31 and P2 31, respectively. The center line P31 in the Y direction is obtained using the mid points P1 31 and P2 31. Similarly, the electron beam is moved in the arrow directions Y1 31 and Y2 31, thereby to obtain the points Q1 and Q2. Further, using these points Q1 and Q2, a center line Q31 in the X direction is obtained. An intersection B31 of the center lines P31 and Q31 is used as a position of the mark M31. In the step S2, the position of a mark, for example, M35, selected from the marks M1 M56 is measured. In step S3, the positions prescribed positions A1 A56 of the marks M1 M56 arrayed in a matrix are calculated from positions of the marks M31 and M35 in the same way as in step 1. With reference to Fig. 6 it will be explained how to calculate the prescribed positions A1 A56. In Fig. 6, the X axis and Y axis are the reference coordinates of the electron beam exposure apparatus. 36A is an imaginary semiconductor wafer placed at a certain position with respect to the X and Y axis. 36B is a semiconductor wafer placed in the apparatus. The wafer 36B is displaced from the wafer 36A and rotated. For explanation s sake, let MiA represent the i th mark Mi formed on the imaginary wafer 36A, and let WCA denote the center of the imaginary wafer 36A. For the same purpose, MiB is used to designate the i th mark Mi of the wafer 36B, and WCB is used to denote the center of the wafer 36B. The angle α defined by the X axis and a broken line 38A passing the marks M35A and M31A is obtained from the demensions of the apparatus and those of the wafer 36A. Then, the angle β defined by the X axis and a broken line 38B passing the marks M35B and M31B is determined from the positions of these marks which have been measured in steps S1, S2. The coordinates of these marks are given as follows The above mentioned angles α, β are represented as follows Here, let ϑ denote β α . Then, the rotational displacement R ϑ of the position vector is given as follows The position of the center WCB of the wafer 36B is then determined. First, the vectors The position of the center WCB is represented as follows Thereafter, the prescribed positions A1 A56 are calculated from the positions of the marks M1A M56A formed on the imaginary wafer 36A. The prescribed position Ai of the i th mark MiB is given as follows In step S4, a pointer is set at 1. In the next step S5, an actual position Bi of the Let us assume that the mark M16 in Fig. 2 is defective. The defective mark involves, for example, the following two cases a the mark M16 is not present, so that the measurement of it is impossible, and b dust 31 is stuck to the mark M16 or the mark M16 has a projection 32, as shown in Fig. 7. Further, a mark M16 is dislocated from its correct position. In such cases, the position B16 of the mark M16 has an incorrect value. Fig. 8 a shows a waveform of the output signal from the A D converter 13 when the semiconductor wafer 5 is scanned by an electron beam in the arrow direction X1 16. This operation is made in the step S5. Fig. 8 b shows a waveform of the output signal of the A D converter 13 when the semiconductor wafer is scanned in the arrow direction X2 16. A center line P16 is obtained using these signals. Similarly, a center line Q16 in the X direction is obtained. An intersection of the center lines P16 and Q16 provides a position of the mark M16. In such cases, even if the mark is at a correct position, the position B16 of the mark M16 is erroneously measured. This is true also in the case where the mark M16 is formed at an incorrect position. In the case a , the position B16 of the mark M16 is not measured in step S5. Accordingly, in step S6, the position of the mark M16 could not be measured, and the control jumps to step S11. In the case b , the position B16 is measured in step S5. The control jumps step S6 to step S7. In step S7, the predicted position A16 as calculated in step S3 is compared with the actual position B16 as actually measured in step S5. If an absolute value of a difference between the predicted position A16 and the actual position B16 is below the tolerance C, the control goes to step S8, as mentioned above. On the other hand, if the difference is above the tolerance C, the control jumps to step S11. The control jumping to step S11 means that the mark M16 is defective. In step S11, the computer 9 measures the positions of the marks around the mark M16, for example, M9, M15, M17, and M24. The computer 9 calculates the position E16 of the mark M16 using the positions of those marks, for example, by an interpolation method. In step S13, the computer 9 stores the position E16 thus obtained in the form of position data D16 of the mark M16. Then, the control advances to step S9. In this step, if it is judged that the measurement of the mark positions is not yet completed, the control progresses to step S10. In this step S10, the pointer is incremented by one. Then, the control returns to step S5 where the position of each of the remaining marks is measured. When the position measurement of the marks on the semiconductor wafer is completed, the control goes to step S14. In this step, the computer 9 performs an electron beam exposure on the semiconductor wafer using the position data D1 D56 obtained in steps S8 the mark is not defective or S13 the mark is defective . Specifically, before the scanning operation begins, the computer 9 corrects the deflection start position of the electron beam using the actual position of the mark as measured in step S5 or the calculated position as calculated in step S13. Any distortion of the semiconductor wafer due to the fabricating process is usually 0.5 µm or less. Therefore, if the tolerance C is set at 0.5 µm, the mark position can be obtained with an accuracy of 0.5 µm or better. In the above mentioned embodiment, the position Bi of the The marks used for calculating the prescribed positions A1 A56 on the semiconductor wafer are not limited to those of M31 and M35. The number of marks is not limited to two, but may be selected to be another appropriate number if necessary. Further, these marks are not limited to those arrayed on dicing lines in a matrix fashion, but may be those arrayed on other places than the dicing lines and in other fashions than the matrix, for example, marks M60, M62 denoted by broken lines in Fig. 2. The marks M9, M15, M17 and M24 used for obtaining the position E16 of the mark M16 may be replaced by other appropriate marks. For example, for obtaining the position of the mark M1, the marks M2 and M11 may be used. In the above mentioned embodiment, the marks M31 and M35, as obtained in the steps S1 and S2, are used for calculating the positions A1 A56 in step S3. This may be modified as shown in the flow chart shown in Fig. 9. In step S21, a pointer is set at 1. In step S22, the position Bi of the Further, the shape of a mark may be a cross mark in place of the L shaped mark. The position data Di of the mark Mi is applicable not only for the electron beam exposure, but also ion implantation method.
