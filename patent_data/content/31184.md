# Process for the preparation of 4 2 dimethylamino ethoxy 2 methyl 5 1 methylethyl phenol esters and their salts.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4 2 dimethylamino ethoxy 2 methyl 5 1 methylethyl phenol esters I and their salts with organic and inorganic acids comprising the reaction of thymol with a salt of an 1 halo dimethylaminoethane to obtain ethylamine N,N dimethyl 2 thymyloxy II , the subsequent reaction of II with an acylating agent according to the Friedel and Kraft reaction to obtain 4 2 dimethylamino ethoxy 2 methyl 5 1 methylethyl 1 acyl benzene III and the oxidation of III to obtain the products I which, if desired, may be transformed in their salts with organic and inorganic acids. This process allows to obtain the products I in high quality and quantity without isolating any intermediate pro duct.
