# Humidity sensor and method for preparing a humidity sensor.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a humidity sensor of electric resistance type whose electric resistance changes in accord ance with an ambient humidity, characterized by a protective film 6 of silicone resin provided on the surface of a humidity sensitive material 3 , and to a method for prepar ing the same. The protective film 6 of silicone resin is formed by applying a varnish of siloxanes to the humidity sensitive material and subjecting the varnish to reaction. The varnish can be of one pot type or two pot type, and desirably the reaction of siloxanes is a cross linking reaction. The formed protective film is not influenced by swelling or shrinking of the humidity sensitive material, and is pre vented from flowing off due to a temperature rise, or from deposition of dusts, etc.
