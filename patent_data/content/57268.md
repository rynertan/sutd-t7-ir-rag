# METHOD OF FABRICATING X RAY LITHOGRAPHIC MASKS

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for fabricating an improved x ray mask which has a high aspect ratio and vertical side walls. First, a thin electrically conductive film 12 is deposited on top of an x ray mask substrate 10 . The conductive film will later act as an electroplating base but it is also sufficiently thin to be substantially x ray transparent. A resist pattern 18 is then formed on top of the electroplating base film using an electron beam to expose the resist. The electron beam resist patternwise masks the electroplating base film during subsequent electroplating deposition of an x ray absorbing layer 20 to form a first x ray absorbing pattern. An x ray sensitive resist 40 is then deposited on top of the first x ray absorbing pattern and exposed to x rays from the bottom. The first x ray absorbing pattern thus patternwise shields the x ray resist. The patternwise exposed x ray resist is then developed to form an x ray resist pattern 46 . Finally, another layer 48 of x ray absorbing material is deposited through the x ray resist pattern by electroplating to form a second x ray absorbing pattern. In the preferred embodiment, the x ray resist is positive acting and the first and second x ray absorbing patterns are complementary. After the second x ray absorbing pattern is deposited in this embodiment, the first x ray absorbing pattern is removed.
