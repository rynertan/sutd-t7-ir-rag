# Micro fluid dispense valve.

## Abstract
The valve arrangement interfaces an enclosed interior re gion under pressure with an exterior region of less pressure through an orifice opening 13 . The orifice wall 11 is tapered from interior to exterior to bound a frustoconical region con stricting toward the exterior to accommodate a magnetizable ball 17 . The ball is held in its seated position against the ori fice wall by permanent magnets 19, 21 imbedded in the wall 11 . An AC coil 23 surrounding the orifice opening 13 acts when energized to cause the ball 17 to move between its seated or closed position and a non magnetizable screen 25 in its open position. The frequency and duration of applied pos itive and negative pulses driving the coil 23 act to control the on off fluid flow duty cycle of the valve.
