# OPAQUE PEARLESCENT FILMS CONTAINING BLENDS OF POLYMERS FOR IMPROVED DISPERSION OF INCOMPATIBLE POLYMER PHASE AND METHOD

## Abstract
Opaque pearlescent polymer films, e.g., polypropylene, containing finely dispersed particles of an incompatible polymer, e.g., Nylon, are improved by blending a polymer compatible with the polymer forming continuous film phase to alter its melt rheology and to cause dispersion of the incompatible polymer in small spherical particles with reduced stringiness.

## Claims
1. An opaque to transluscent, biaxially oriented, melt extruded polymeric film comprising a continuous phase of a blend of a first polymer and a rheology modifying agent and a dispersed phase of a finely divided second polymer which is incompatible with the first polymer the rheology modifying agent being a polymer compatible with the first polymer but incompatible with the second dispersed polymer the rheology modifying agent altering the character of the first polymer so that the dispersed second polymer is formed in smaller particles with fewer stringy particles than the film made without the rheology modifying agent.

## Description
Opaque polymeric films in which the opacifying agent is finely divided polymer dispersed in the continuous film polymer phase are described in U.S. Patent 4,377,616. In this patent the film is prepared by melting a mixture of a major proportion of a film forming polymer such as polypropylene and a minor proportion of an incompatible polymer which has a higher melting point, such as nylon, at a temperature sufficient to melt the incompatible polymer and to dispense it in the film forming polymer, extruding the mixture into a film and biaxially orienting the film. The dispersed incompatible polymer provides sites for the formation of voids surrounding the dispersed polymer particles when the film is oriented. These voids provide opacity and give the film an attractive pearlescent sheen. Reduction of the size of the dispersed particles and reduction of the occurrence of stringiness in those particles, as sometimes occurs, results in a film having improved opacity and better appearance. Such improvements are provided in accordance with this invention. This invention provides improved opaque to translucent, biaxially oriented melt extruded polymeric film comprising a continuous, film forming polymeric phase and a finely divided, dispersed, polymeric opacifier phase which is incompatible with the continuous phase, wherein a rheology modifying agent which is compatible with the continuous phase but incompatible with the dispersed phase is incorporated in the continuous phase to reduce the particle size and stringiness in the dispersed phase. This invention also provides a method of making an opaque to translucent, biaxially oriented, melt extruded polymeric film having a continuous, film forming polymeric phase and a dispersed, polymeric opacifier phase which is incompatible with the continuous phase comprising incorporating in the continuous phase an effective amount of a rheology modifying agent which is compatible with the continuous phase but incompatible with the dispersed phase to reduce the particle size and stringiness in the dispersed phase, thus improving dispersion of the dispersed phase in the film. The improvements obtained in accordance with this invention in reduced particle size and reduced stringiness of the dispersed incompatible polymeric phase are obtained by incorporating a rheology modifying agent which is compatible with the film forming continuous polymeric phase. A variety of materials are believed to be suitable. Linear low density copolymers of ethylene and higher olefins can advantageously be used. Such copolymers are widely commercially available and are described in U.S. Patent 4,076,698. Linear low density copolymers generally have a density of about 0.90 to 0.94 gm cm³ and contain a comonomer which is preferably a monoolefin having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, such as 1 butene, 1 hexene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, and 1 octene. Generally, ethylene polymers which are compatible with the preferred film forming polypropylene polymer are useful. Such polymers include low density polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubbers. It is also considered necessary that the rheology modifying additive resin which is compatible with the film forming polymer which constitutes the continuous phase be incompatible with the resin which forms the dispersed particle phase. In the preferred combination where polypropylene is the film forming continuous polymer phase and Nylon is the dispersed polymer, linear low density polyethylenes meet the requirements for compatibility for the polypropylene and incompatibility with the Nylon. The additive polymer is incorporated in effective amounts which are generally in the range of 5 to 25 wt based on the weight of resins in the film forming continuous phase. The methods for preparing the films described in U.S. Patent 4,377,616 can be used herein. As described therein, the films can contain additional components such as inorganic fillers and the like. Similarly, the films can contain one or more additional layers in order to achieve high gloss, heat sealability or other desired characteristics. This invention is illustrated by the following non limiting example in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise specified. Resin blends were prepared by melting the polymeric components, cast extruding the melts and biaxially orienting the films. The films were examined under an optical microscope to note the particle size and shape of the dispersed Nylon phase. The LLDPE additive was a linear low density copolymer of ethylene and 1 butene having a density of about 0.92 gm cm³.
