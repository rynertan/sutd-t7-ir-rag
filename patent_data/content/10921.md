# Direct current detecting device using saturable reactors.

## Abstract
A direct current detecting device is disclosed in which two pairs of saturable cores 11, 12 13, 14 are provided so as to enclose a conductor 21 carrying a direct current to be measured. On each core, a bias winding 51 54 , a feedback winding 41 44 and an output winding 31 34 are wound. First and second output circuits 1, 2 are pro vided, each connected with one pair of output windings and including two closed current paths each consisting of one of the output windings, a common load 63 64 , a common a.c. supply source 61 62 and a diode 75, 76 77, 78 . These diodes function to allow the greater one of current flows of the two closed paths to be passed through the common load, in order to give an output signal in which slits or notches are reduced. An amplifier 100 is connected to receive the difference between output signals of the two output circuits and to supply its output to the feedback winding, whereby the magnitude of the feedback current becomes a function of the magnitude of the cur rent flowing through the conductor and can be measured by an indicator 102.
