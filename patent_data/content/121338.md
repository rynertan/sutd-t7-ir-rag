## Description
This invention relates to the polypeptide hormone human Nerve Growth Factor NGF , its preparationusing recombinant technology and compositions which contain it. A multi component protein of molecular weight 130,000 has been isolated from mouse salivaryglands, it being particularly concentrated in the glands of male mice, which is commonly referred to as Nerve Growth Factor . The principal neural activity exhibited by the protein has been its ability to causean increase in the size of sensory neurons, nerve cells which transmit impulses from NGF as obtained by extraction at neutral pH from mouse salivary glands is known as 7S NGF and ismade up of three subunits termed α, β and γ subunits. All of the neural activity of 7S NGF is exhibited bythe β subunit, a dimer of two identical 118 amino acid peptides bound together by non covalent forces. Thissubunit is also referred to as 2.5S NGF. The α subunit has no known biological activity. The γ subunit,however, is an arginine esteropeptidase. The initial genetic product in the synthesis of NGF is a prepro NGFpolypeptide which is cleaved by the γ subunit. The γ subunit has also been shown to accelerate woundhealing in mice. Recently, a third NGF component M. wt. 116,000 has been reported to have been isolated frommouse salivary glands and to have shown to exhibit the property of being a plasminogen activator, i.e., itconverts plasminogen to plasmin, suggesting its utility in the lysis of blood clots. See European PatentApplication Nerve Growth Factor and Process For Obtaining It 78300656.2 Publication No. 0002139A1 filed November 22, 1978, published May 30, 1979. As indicated above, the neural activity of NGF is exhibited by the β subunit hereinafter βNGF . It hasbeen shown to stimulate markedly regenerative resprouting of transected axons of central adrenergicneurons, a property which makes it useful in the repair of damaged axons. Recombinant DNA technology has reached the age of some sophistication. Molecular biologists areable to recombine various DNA sequences with some facility, creating new DNA entities capable ofproducing copious amounts of exogenous protein product in transformed microbes and cell cultures. Thegeneral means and methods are in hand for the DNA recombination of the essential elements, i.e., an origin of replication, one or more phenotypicselection characteristics, an expression promoter, heterologous gene insert and remainder vector,generally is performed outside the host cell. The resulting recombinant replicable expression vector, orplasmid, is introduced into cells by transformation and large quantities of the recombinant vehicle obtainedby growing the transformant. Where the gene is properly inserted with reference to portions which governthe transcription and translation of the encoded DNA message, the resulting expression vector is useful toproduce the polypeptide sequence for which the inserted gene codes, a process referred to as expression . The resulting product may be obtained by lysis, if necessary, of the host cell and recovery ofthe product by appropriate purifications from other proteins. In practice, the use of recombinant DNA technology can express entirely heterologous polypeptides so called direct expression or alternatively may express a heterologous polypeptide fused to a portion ofthe amino acid sequence of a homologous polypeptide. In the latter cases, the intended bioactive product issometimes rendered bioinactive within the fused, homologous heterologous polypeptide until it is cleavedin an extracellular environment. Similarly, the art of cell or tissue cultures for studying genetics and cell physiology is well established.Means and methods are in hand for maintaining permanent cell lines, prepared by successive serialtransfers from isolated normal cells. For use in research, such cell lines are maintained on a solid support inliquid medium, or by growth in suspension containing support nutriments. Scale up for large preparationsseems to pose only mechanical problems. Likewise, protein biochemistry is a useful, indeed necessary, adjunct in biotechnology. Cells producingthe desired protein also produce hundreds of other proteins, endogenous products of the cell smetabolism. These contaminating proteins, as well as other compounds, if not removed from the desiredprotein, could prove toxic if administered to an animal or human in the course of therapeutic treatmentwith desired protein. Hence, the techniques of protein biochemistry come to bear, allowing the design of separation procedures suitable for the particular system under consideration and providing ahomogeneous product safe for intended use. Protein biochemistry also proves the identity of the desiredproduct, characterizing it and ensuring that the cells have produced it faithfully with no alterations ormutations. This branch of science is also involved in the design of bioassays, stability studies and otherprocedures necessary to apply before successful clinical studies and marketing can take place. The present invention provides the β subunit of human NGF, which previously had not been isolatedby extraction techniques or otherwise synthesized, in essentially pure form. Further, we have discoveredthat, unexpectedly, β NGF can be expressed as a heterologous protein in The β NGF which the invention provides is useful in treating nerve damage or for other relatedpurposes for which it is beneficial. Being identical with naturally secreted human β NGF, but free of otherprotein of mammalian origin, it is unlikely its use will result in an immunogenic response during treatmentwith it, unlike the case when peptide hormones of non human origin are used to treat human illness.Furthermore, being obtained as a heterologous protein, the β NGF will be essentially free of other proteinsof mammalian origin which accompany β NGF obtained as a tissue extract and which may exhibitundesirable biological activity in compositions which contain them. The invention is further directed to replicable DNA expression vectors which contain a gene sequencewhich encode for the polypeptide in expressible form. The invention is also directed to recombinant hostcells such as microorganism strains or cell lines transformed with such vectors, and to the cultures thereof.Still further, the invention is directed to compositions comprising the polypeptide for parenteraladministration. Accordingly an object of this invention is to acquire human β NGF essentially free of other mammalianproteins. Another object is to obtain human β NGF in quantities in excess of those which are possible byextraction from natural sources.

Figure 2 shows a Northern Blot Analysis of clones containing segments of β NGF mRNA. Figure 3 is a partial restriction map of the mouse NGF gene and the approximate correspondencebetween the nucleotide sequences of plasmids constructed in the making of the invention with thenucleotide sequence of the mouse NGF gene.

Figure 6 shows a comparison of nucleotide sequences of human and mouse Prepro β NGF gene andamino acid sequences. Figure 7 shows the gene constructed for expression of human β NGF. Figure 8 depicts a portion of the process for assembling the plasmid ph NGF As used in the present application, the term expression vector includes vectors which are capable ofexpressing DNA sequences contained therein, where such sequences are operably linked to othersequences capable of effecting their expression. It is implied, although not always explicitly stated, thatthese expression vectors must be replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral partof the chromosomal DNA. Clearly a lack of replicability would render them effectively inoperable. In sum, expression vector is given a functional definition, and any DNA sequence which is capable of effectingexpression of a specified DNA code disposed therein is included in this term as it is applied to the specifiedsequence. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids which refer to circular double stranded DNA loops which, in their vector form are not bound tothe chromosome. In the present specification, plasmid and vector are used interchangeably as theplasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include suchother forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which become known in the artsubsequently hereto. Further as used herein, the term recombinant host cells refers to cells which have been transformedwith vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. The vectors and methods disclosed herein are suitable for use in host cells over a wide range ofprokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In general, of course, prokaryotes are preferred for cloning of DNA sequences in constructing thevectors useful in the invention. For example, Prokaryotes may also be used for expression. The aforementioned strains, as well as In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from speciescompatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries areplication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection intransformed cells. For example, In addition to prokaryates, eukaryotic microbes, such as yeast cultures may also be used. Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman, et al., In addition to microorganisms, cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be usedas hosts. In principle, any such cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture.However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissueculture has become a routine procedure in recent years For use in mammalian cells, the control functions on the expression vectors are often provided by viralmaterial. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and mostfrequently Simian Virus 40 SV40 . The early and late promoters of SV40 virus are particularly usefulbecause both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin ofreplication Fiers, et al, An origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral e.g. Polyoma, Adeno, VSV, BPV, etc. source, ormay be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into thehost cell chromosome, the latter is often sufficient. If cells without formidable cell wall barriers are used as host cells, transfection is carried out by thecalcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Graham and Van der Eb, If prokaryotic cells or cells which contain substantial cell wall constructions are used, the preferredmethod of transfection is calcium treatment using calcium chloride as described by Cohen, F. N., et al, Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employ standardligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the formdesired to form the plasmids required. Cleavage is performed by treating with restriction enzyme or enzymes in suitable buffer. In general,about 1 µg plasmid or DNA fragments is used with about 1 unit of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by themanufacturer . Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 C are workable. After incubations, protein is removedby extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction byprecipitation with ethanol. If blunt ends are required, the preparation is treated for 15 minutes at 15 with 10 units of Size separation of the cleaved fragments is performed using 6 percent polyacrylamide gel described byGoeddel, D., et al, For ligation approximately equimolar amounts of the desired components, suitably end tailored toprovide correct matching are treated with about 10 units T4 DNA ligase per 0.5 g DNA. When cleavedvectors are used as components, it may be useful to prevent religation of the cleaved vector bypretreatment with bacterial alkaline phosphatase . The ligation mixture was used to transform The following description of preferred embodiments involving polypeptide expression in In order to obtain a gene coding for the β subit of human NGF, it was determined to use cloned cDNAcoding for mouse β NGF as a hybridization probe. The cDNA cloning approach took advantage of the known amino acid sequence of the mouse β NGFsubunit which is shown in Figure 1, employing synthetic oligonucleotide primers the difference in NGFlevels found in male and female mouse salivary glands was used as an additional means of identification.Three small portions of the mouse β NGF amino acid sequence were chosen, and oligonucleotide poolscomplementary to all possible sequences coding for them were synthesized by the method of Crea, et al, Initial attempts to identify or isolate mouse β NGF cDNA clones from an oligo dT primed, cDNA bankfrom male mouse salivary glands failed, using the synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. Thisresult indicated that while β NGF comprised 0.1 percent of the protein in the male salivary glands, itsmRNA was not of equal abundance. Therefore, the primer pool representing sequences closest to thecarboxyl terminus of the protein Figure 1, Clones scored as positive in the first screen were rescreened using radiolabeled primer pools 2 and 3,derived from DNA sequences upstream from oligonucleotide pool 1 as shown in Figure 1, as hybridizationprobes. In addition, In order to determine the size of the complete NGF mRNA, northern blot hybridization as well as primerextension analysis was employed. A 470 bp long In order to obtain cloned cDNA which included the sequences from the 3 end of the primer sequencedownstream to the 3 polyA sequence, we first enriched for β NGF mRNA by fractionating total polyA A human gene library consisting of 15 20 kb, partial HaeIII Alul human fetal liver DNA fragmentsinserted into λCharon 4A vectors , was screened using the 470 bp mouse NGF cloned cDNA fragment pmβ N 9G1 Rsal fragment described above as radioactive hybridization probe. A total of 27 recombinantphage were plaque purified and partially characterized by EcoRI digestion the 27 phage displayed 6different types of restriction pattern. Each pattern category shared restriction fragments and thus appearedto overlap the same genomic region. The phage designated γhβN8 was further characterized by physicalmapping and nucleotide sequencing Figure 4 shows a physical map of done γhβN8 and regions flankingits sequences in the human genome, generated by phage mapping, sequencing and genomic Southernblotting experiments. A portion of a 12,000 bp nucleotide sequence derived from subcloned, overlappingEcoRI and HindIII fragments is shown in Figure 5. The mouse β NGF cDNA sequence contains a reading frame with the potential to code for matureβ NGF, and the predicted amino acid sequence corresponds to the known sequence of mouse β NGF.Angeletti, et al, The human β NGF gene contains a region predicting an amino acid sequence approximately 90percent homologous with the mature mouse β NGF amino acid sequence, which, therefore, must be thegene for human β NGF. The human β NGF protein also has a C terminal dipeptide extension. When one aligns the human and mouse β NGF sequences Figure 6 it becomes clear that extensivehomology extends a significant distance upstream from the known sequence of the mature mouse protein.Evidence has been presented for the existence of a 22,000 dalton biosynthetic pro β NGF precursor. Bergerand Shooter, Three methionine residues are candidates for designation as the protein synthesis initiation codon amino acids 187, 121 and 119 in Figure 6 , however several factors strongly implicate amino acid 121 of our sequence as the actual initiation codon employed. Since β NGF is a secreted protein, theinitiation codon is likely to be followed by a signal sequence for cotranslational transfer of this polypeptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Amino acids 121 to 104 represent an excellent candidatesignal sequence. These 18 amino acids are of the correct length and include a stretch of six completelyhydrophobic amino acids ala phe leu ile gly val . Cleavage by signal peptidase could occur betweenthe small amino acid ala 104 and the glu residue at position 103. It is known that signal peptidase cleavesafter an identical gln ala sequence to leave an identical N terminal glu residue in the case of pre alphalactalbumin. The stretch of amino acids following the met residue at position 187 contains a highpercentage of polar and charged amino acids and bears no resemblance to any previously described signalsequence. Therefore, it seems most likely that methionine 121 is used for translation initiation of mouse andhuman prepro β NGF which would result in a 27,000 dalton preprohormone and a 25,000 dalton pro β NGFif signal peptide processing occurs at residue 104. EcoRI fragments from λhβ N8 were subcloned in pBR322. A subclone plasmid we designatedphβ N8 B9 contained a 2 kb human DNA insert, including most of the sequences coding for the humanβ NGF subunit. Sequencing determined that only the 10 NH The plasmid phβ N8 B9 was digested with EcoRI and HgiAl and a 300 bp fragment was isolated fromthe digestion mixture. This fragment is shown in Figure 7, with the sticky end termini resulting from the twostep digestion indicated. In order to construct the 5 end of the human β NGF sequence for expression, thecodons for the 10 missing amino acids, the initiator methionine codon ATG , and nucleotides precedingthe ATG which are part of a ribosome binding site and include the cleavage site for the restrictionendonuclease Xbal were added four oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized for this purpose andare shown in Figure 7 as oligonucleotides I IV. The 3 end of the β NGF coding region was modified as follows the nucleotide sequence of both DNAstrands downstream from the single HgiAl site shown in Figure 7 at amino acid position Val 111 andLeu 112 of the mature human β NGF was chemically synthesized, including a termination codon TAG following Arg 118 and a Sall sticky end. These oligonucleotides are fragments V and VI in Figure 7. Synthetic oligonucleotides I VI were radioactively labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase andγ Preparative gel electrophoresis of the DNA mixture and autoradiography demonstrated the presenceof a radioactive doublet at 370 bp. The bands were cut out separately and electrophoretically eluted. Theeluted DNA fragments were then ligated T4 DNA ligase to a HGH Trp expression plasmid designatedpHGH207 1 that had been treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase after digestion with Xbal and Sall. The alkaline phosphatase treatment was used to prevent reinsertion of the HGH fragment into the Trpexpression vector . The ligation mixture was used to transform The sequence of operations from digestion of plasmid phβN8 B9 with EcoRI and HgiAl to assembly ofplasmid phβNGF Two pools of 8 primers each 14 bases were chemically synthesized. Each primer was complementaryto a potential mRNA sequence for amino acids 93 96 and a portion of 97. A mixture of the 16oligonucleotides was used to specifically prime the synthesis of cDNA on poly A 200 µg of poly A The human β NGF of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to preparepharmaceutically useful compositions whereby the β NGF is combined in admixture with apharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle. Suitable vehicles and their formulation, inclusive of otherhuman proteins, e.g. human serum albumin, are described for example in Remington s The human β NGF hereof may be parenterally administered to subjects suffering from nerve damageor other conditions for which it is therapeutically effective. Dosage and dose rate may parallel that currentlyin use in clinical investigations of such agents derived, for example, from mouse salivary glands. Notwithstanding that reference has been made to particular preferred embodiments, it will be furtherunderstood that the present invention is not to be construed as limited to such, rather to the lawful scope ofthe appended claims.
