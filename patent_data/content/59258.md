Pharmacological Tests Anti cancer Activist 1 Test procedure A mouse ICR strain, femaie, 50 days age was shaved at the back of neck to the extent of S cm2 . 7112 Di ethylbenzo t2 anthracene was dissolved in acetone to give 75 mg 100 ml.solution. The so Drepared solution was applied to the mouse on the 60th day of age and further on the 75th day of aqe in the amount of 0.2 ml per mouse. Croton oil was dissolved in acetone to give 250 mg 100 ml solution, and the so prepared solution was applied to the mouse in the amount of 0.2 ml per mouse, twice a week until the treatment was started. When 3 7 papillomata diamether of 3 8 mm for each, and total diameter of 30 60 mm were produced for a mouse, the treatment was started. The compound to be tested test compound was dissolved in groundnut oil to give 20 mg ml solution, and administered orally to the mouse. the solution was administered 10 times for 14 days once a day , and the diameters of the papillomata were measured on the 14th day to determine the total diameter for each mouse. Ratio of increase or decrease of the papillomata was calculated from the total diameter on the 14th day and the total diameter measured prior to the starting of administration of the test compound. This value was adopted for evaluating the anti cancer activity. 2 Results Table 1EMI5.1 tb SEP Numbe SEP Ratio SEP of. tb SEP of SEP inareaseo tb SEP Test SEP Compound SEP decrease SEP o tb SEP mouse SEP U tb SEP Croundnut SEP onl SEP .

Toxicity Tests 1 Test procedure The test compound was administered repeatedly to a group of 6 mice ICR strain, female for 14 days in the dosage of 200 mg kg iday. In the course of the administration pro ceduresj increase or decrease of the weight of the mouse, oceurance, of death, etc. were obseryed. 2 Test compound The compounds set forth in the above Table 1 were employed. 3 Test results No death was observed. Decrease of the weight was not .observed, and a little increase of the weight was observed No symptoms indicating the effects of side actIons, such as falling out df hair, cyanosis, etc., were observed. The decrease of the weight and the falling out of hair are known as indicating the hypervitaminosis of Vitamin A.Accordingly, the results are considered to indicate that the polyprenyl compounds of the formula I do not cause the hypervitaminosis of Vitamin A. In view of the pharmacological test results and the toxicity test results Åas described hereinbefore, the polyprenyl compounds of the formula I are judged to be of high safety and to be of value as anti cancer agents for prevention and treatment of cancer and precancerous conditions. It is well known that mouse papillomate as mentioned above are useful as a model for proliferous, allergic keratinization.Accordingly it is understood from the above shown data that the compound according to the invention is effective also against skin diseases with keratinization. For the application as anUt cancer agent, the poly prenyl compound of the formula I can be administered orally in the form of powder, granule, pellet, hard capsule, etc., or parenterally in the form of ointment, suppository, injec tion solution, etc. The dosage is generally set in the range of 40 mg to 4 g day for an adult. If the polyprenyl compound of the formula I is applied in the form of an external preparation, the dosage can be varied depending on the largeness of area on the affected part. The above mentioned preparations can be prepared from the polyprenyl compound and generally employable carriers for the medical use by utilizing the conventional methods.

To this solution was added 1 g. of triethylamine, and further added 1.1 g. of ethyl chldrocarbonate under stirring at room temperature. After 10 minutes, the reaction liquid was poured into 100 ml. of water, and extracted with 100 ml. of n hexane.The extract was washed with 50 ml. of water and evaporated to remove the solvent. The residue was dissolved in 30 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. To this solution was added 1.1 g. of paminophenol, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. To the reaction liquid was added 200 ml. of diethyl ether, and the mixture was washed successively with two 50 ml. portions of dilute hydrochloric acid and two 50 ml.portions of water. The ether phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to remove the solvent. The residue was crystallized from ethanol to obtain 3.2 g. of the desired product as pale yellow crystals.
