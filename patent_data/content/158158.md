# Auxiliary device driving unit driven by an engine.

## Abstract
An auxiliary device driving unit driven by an engine com prises an input member 6 fixed to a crank shaft 2 of the engine and provided with a disc like portion 6a and a cy lindrical portion 6b , an output member 7 placed opposing the disc like portion in a freely rotatable manner, the output member 7 having the same axial center as the cylindrical portion of the input member, a plurality of planet cone mem bers 8 in a conical shape which are supported by the outer peripheries of the input and output members 6,7 through partial contact, a speed change ring 10 which is in contact with the cone generatrix of said planet cone members 8 and is movable along the same axial center line as the input member 6 , a speed change shaft 19 having a feeding means for controlling movement of the speed change ring 10 in the axial direction, a motor 20 for rotating the speed change shaft 19 , an electric circuit for controlling the motor 20 , a driven member 13 which is coupled to the output member 7 through a ball cam 16 and is rotatable on said cylindrical portion 6b of input member 6 and a crank pulley 3 fixedly supported by the driven member 13 .
