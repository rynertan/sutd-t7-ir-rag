# Galactomannan polysaccharide gum formulation containing gellation inhibitor.

## Abstract
The gellation of polysaccharide gums such as guar or locust bean gum is inhibited by gelatin hydrolysates, at alkaline pH. Formulations of gum, gelatin hydrolysate and alkaliniser are reconstituted by shaking with water, and are easily imbibed. The inhibition is reversed by pH change in the stomach allowing gellation to occur, The formulation is useful in treatment of hypercholesteraemia, gastric disorders and as an adjunct to insulin therapy.
