# Improvements in tungsten recovery.

## Abstract
The scarcity of high grade tungsten ores obliges users to seek to recover it from scrap materials, but drill bits in particular pose especial problems. Existing proposals to use acidic hydrogen peroxide to oxidise and solubilise tungsten are extremely inefficient in reagent consumption per unit tungsten recovered. According to the present invention hydrogen peroxide can be used considerably more efficiently with sub stoichiometric reagent addition per stage, especially from 6 to 12 stages and by the use of a small amount of certain promoters which it is believed may form a water soluble complex with tungsten which provides an alternative route for tungsten dissolution. Many of the promoters are aromatic hydroxyl or amino acids such as 2 hydroxybenzoic acid, 2 aminobenzoic acid, 4 hydroxybenzene phenol and its re lated oxidation products such as 1, 4 benzoquinone. Also, certain aliphatic acids such as tartaric and epoxy succinic acid show some promotional activity.
