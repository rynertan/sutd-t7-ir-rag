# Improvements in electrolytic reduction cells.

## Abstract
In an electrolytic reduction cell for the production of a molten metal by electrolysis of a molten electrolyte, the pro duct metal collects on a cathodic carbon floor having em bedded steel current collector bars for leading out the cathod ic current. In order to reduce the wave motion of the metal due to interaction of horizontal currents in the product metal with the magnetic fields due to currents in conductors associated with the cell, electrically non conductive barrier members are arranged on the floor of the cell transversely of horizontal cur rents in the product metal. Such barrier members have at least a surface layer of material resistant to product metal and ex tend upwardly from the cell floor to a height approximating to the normal maximum operating level of product metal.
