## Description
POLYETHER BISBIGUANIDES This invention relates to bisbiguanide derivatives, and in particular to polyether bisbiguanides which possess antibacterial properties. Certain bisbiguanides are well known as antibacterial, particularly antiseptic, agents. For example, in United Kingdom patent specification No. 705,838 there are disclosed and claimed bisbiguanides of the general formula A NH.C NH NH.C NH NH CH NH.C N NH.C NH Nfl A 2n wherein A stands for a phenyl radical which is substituted by alkyl, alkoxy, nitro or halogen, and wherein the two A s may be the same or different and wherein n is an integer from 3 to 9 inclusive, and wherein the polymethylene chain may be interrupted by oxygen atoms and or by aromatic nuclei.The compounds are said to be useful as bactericides for example, those of the formula A NH.C NH NH.C NH NH CH NH.C NH NH.C NH NH.A II 2 5 7 wherein A stands for a halogen substituted phenyl radical, possess very high antibacterial activity when tested in vitro against the organisms Steptococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus coli,Clostridium welchii and Pseudomonas pyocyanea. Similarly, in United Kingdom patent specification No. 1,095,902 there is disclosed and claimed a broad group of bisguanides and bisbiguanides which includes inter alia compounds of the formula 2 RR N E C NH NH A NH.C NR NRR III x x 2 wherein A stands for an alkylene radical of 2 to 12 carbon atoms having the valency bonds attached to different carbon atoms, or for a group of the formula EMI2.1 R stands for an alkyl radical of 6 to 16 carbon atoms, R stands for hydrogen, and x stands for 1 or 2. The bisguanides and bisbiguanides are said to have particular usefulness as plant fungicides and bactericides. None of these disclosures, however, particularly describes any bisbiguanide compound wherein the group linking the two biguanide residues is a polyether. A paper by Rose and Swain, J. Chem. Soc., 1956, 4422 4425, describes inter alia three bisbiguanides in which the linking group is an ether, namely EMI3.1 but none of these compounds is mentioned as being of particular interest as an antibacterial agent in the paper by Rose and Swain s co workers, Davies et al., Brit. J.Pharmacol., 1954, 9, 192, which describes antibacterial results for compounds of interest made by Rose and Swain. A series of patents from the Procter and GambleCompany, United Kingdom Patents Numbers 1,432,487, 1,449,302 and 1,507,846 and United States Patent Number 4,025,616, relate to specialised toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. compositions containing certain bisbiguanides, including inter alia such compounds in which the two biguanide residues are linked by a 2 12C polymethylene chain which can be interrupted by up to 5 ether, thioether, phenyl or naphthyl moities . The synthesis of bisbiguanides containing such linking groups is not described, but it is alleged that the bis biguanide compounds of this invention are known, having been disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,684,924, Rose et al., U.S.Patent 2,990,425, Senior et al., U.S. Patent 2,830,006,Burtwell sic et al., and U.S. Patent 2,863,019, Burtwell sic et al . This latter number is an error for 2,863,919, which is shown correctly in United KingdomPatent No. 1,507,846 . Birtwell and Senior were coworkers of Rose, and the corresponding United Kingdom Patents are respectively Numbers 705,838 Rose , 815,925 Senior , 745,064 Birtwell and 785,937 Birtwell .However, the allegation that the Procter and Gamble bisbiguanides are known from the patents of Rose, Senior and Birtwell is completely incorrect insofar as it purports to relate to bisbiguanides in which the biguanide residues are linked by a polyether The only polyether linking group specifically described by Rose, Senior orBirtwell is that shown in formula VI above. United Kingdom Patent Number 1,401,518 discloses bisbiguanides wherein the two biguanide groups are joined by a monoether linking group, for use as anti acne agents. Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a polyether bisbiguanide derivative of the formula 12 7 3 4 8 56 R R N.C NR NH.C NH NR X NR .C NH NH.C NR NR R VIII 1 2 5 6 or a tautomer thereof, wherein R , R , R and R which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, a 1 16C alkyl radical, a 2 16C alkoxyalkyl radical, a 3 12C cycloalkyl radical, a 3 12C cycloalkyl l 4C alkyl radical, an optionally substituted phenyl, phenyl 1 4C alkyl or phenyl l 4C alkoxy l 4C alkyl radical, or 1 2R and R and the nitrogen atom to which they are 5 6 attached, or R and R and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, which may be the same or different, are each a l azetidinyl, l pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, hexamethyleneimino, heptamethyleneimino, morpholino or 4 tl 8C alkanoyl 1 piperazinyl radical each of which may bear 3 4 1 3C alkyl substituents R and R , which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen or 1 16C alkyl radical, a 3 16C cycloalkyl radical, a 3 12C cycloalkyl 1 4C alkyl radical, an optionally substituted phenyl radical, an optionally substituted phenyl l 4C alkyl or naphthyl l 4C alkyl radical, or an optionally 7 8 substituted diphenylmethyl radical R and R are each hydrogen or a 1 8C alkyl radical and X is a linking group of the formula 1 2 CH Z .Y.Z CH IX 2x 2y 1 2 wherein Z and Z are each an oxygen or sulphur atom,Y is a polymethylene, p phenylene, 1,4 phenylenedimethylene or l,5 naphthylene radical, a radical of the formula EMI5.1 or a polymethylene radical which is interrupted by up to 5 ether oxygen or thioether sulphur atoms, and x and y are integers being 2 or greater, such that the total number of methylene groups in the linking group X is not more than 18 and the acid addition salts thereof. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Each of R , R , R , R , R and R may be, for example, a methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, t ert butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, octyl, 2 ethylhexyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclopentylmethyl or cyclohexylmethyl radical, particularly the ethylhexyl, n hexyl and cyclohexyl radicals.

The term polymethylene 1 in the definition of Y above is to be understood to include, for example, methylene, ethylene, trimethylene and hexamethylene.Thus, particular values for X are, for example, the following CH2 2O CH2 2O CH2 2 XI CH2 3O CH2 2O CH2 3 XII CH2 3O CH2 4O CH2 3 XIII CH2 3O CH2 8O CH2 3 XIV CH2 3O CH2 2O CH2 2O CH2 3 XVEMI8.1 The acid additon salts of the invention may be derived from an inorganic or organic acid. In most circumstances it is preferable that the salts be derived from an acid which affords an anion which is suitable for human usage, for example a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. Examples of such acids are hydrochoric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, acetic, D gluconic, 2pyrrolidone 5 carboxylic acids, methanesulphonic, carbonic, lactic and glutamic acids. Particular preferred polyether bisbiguanides of the invention are 4,7 dioxadecanebis 5 2 ethylhexyl biguanide , 4,9 dioxadodecanebist5 2 ethylhexyl biguanide , 4,9 dioxadodecanebis 1 benzyl 5 cyclohexylbiguanide , 0,0 bis 3 5 hexylbiguanido propyl hydroquinone, 4,9 dioxadodecanebis 1 2,4 dichlorobenzyl 5 ethylbiguanide and 3, 6 dioxa octanebisES 2 ethylhexyl biguanide , and their dihydrochlorides. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the 7 8 compounds of the invention wherein R and R are each hydrogen, which comprises reacting a bis cyanoguanidine of the formula 3 4 NC.NH.C NH NR X NR .C NH .EH.CN XIX 12 with an amine, R R NH, or successively with two 1 2 56 different amines, R R NH and R R NH in the form of 1 2 an acid acid addition salt thereof, wherein X, R , R 3 4 5 6R , R , R and R have the meanings stated above, o o at a temperature of 100 to 170 C. A suitable amine salt is, for example, the hydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperatures, but if thermal stability is a problem, the reaction is carxied out at lower temperature over a longer period. The reactants are most conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent such as 2 methoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, nitrobenzene, sulpholane, isopropanol, n butanol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or water, or a mixture of such solvents, may be used. This bis cyanoguanidine of the formula XIX, which may be used as the starting material in the above process, maW be obtained by reacting the appropriate 4 diamine NHR X NHR , in the form of an acid addition salt, conveniently the dihydrochloride, with sodium dicyanamide, in conventional manner.

A suitable salt of the diamine is, for example, the dihydrochloride. The reactants are heated together until the reaction is complete. The reaction proceeds fastest at higher temperatures, but where thermal stability is a problem, the reaction is carried out at lower temperature for a longer period. If a melt can be formed at those temperatures the reactants are conveniently melted together in the absence of a solvent.If not, or alternatively, the reactants are heated together in a suitable inert solvent, for example those mentioned above. 3 4 The amine of the formula R NH X NHR , which is used as the starting material in the above process, may be obtained by alkylation of the primary diamineNH X NH in conventional manner, for example by 2 2 reaction with an alkyl halide, or by reductive alkylation with an aldehyde. The cyanoguanidines of the formulae XX and XXI, 7 8 wherein R and R are hydrogen, which are used as the starting materials in the above process, may be obtained bf reacting sodium dicyanamide with an appropriate amineR R NH or R R NH, in the form of an acid addition salt, conveniently the dihydrochloride, in a suitable inert solvent. The cyanoguanidines of the formulae XX and XXI 7 8 wherein R and R are is other than hydrogen, which may be used as starting materials in the above process, may be obtained by reacting a dialkyl cyanoimido dithiocarbonate, for example dimethyl cyanoimido dithiocarbonate, MeS C N.CN, with appropriate amines 12 7 2R R NH and R NH which are preferably the same , 56 or R R NH and R NH 2 The acid addition salts of the invention are obtained by conventional means. The antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention has been measured by the well known minimum inhibitory concentration MIC test. Neat or diluted broth cultures of eight Gram positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, 3 strains of Staphyloccus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans,S. sanguis , Candida albicans and fourteen Gram negative organisms 4 strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella dublin, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae,Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis and 3 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inocculated by means of an automatic mirotitre innoculator on the surface of nutrient agar plates containing two fold or five fold dilutions of a test compound. After incubation overnight 0 at 37 C., the MIC s of the test compound are read.The geometric mean MIC s for the Gram positive organisms andCandida, and 14 Gram negative organisms are then calculated for each test compound. Depending upon its precise chemical structure, a compound of the invention has a mean MIC within the range 1 12 lug, ml. in agar against the 8 Gram positive organisms and Candida, and 20 250 . ml. in agar against the 14 Gram negative organisms. The preferred compounds of the invention have an acute LD50 within the accepted limits for compounds used topically, are of low irritancy in the Draize test on intact rabbit skin, are negative in the Ames test for mutagenicity, and are non sensitizing in the Magnusson andKligman contact sensitivity test in guinea pigs. Because of their antibacterial and or antifungal properties, the compounds of the invention are useful for many purposes, for example a in medical and veterinary practice for the disinfection of wounds, membranes and or skin tissue and b for the sterilisation of surgical instruments and other medical apparatus and equipment, for example respirators, ventilators, incubators, humidifiers, etc. c for incorporation in toothpastes and mouthwashes for inhibiting the formation of dental plaque, and gingivitis d for the disinfection of hard surfaces, for example plant and equipment used in the food and drink industries, and floors and walls in the home, factories and hospitals e for the disinfection of textiles, for example blankets, overalls, bed linen, etc. f for the control of microbiological slime in the pulp and paper industries g for the control of micro organisms in swimming pools, cooling water, pasteuriser water, aqueous oil emulsions such as metal working fluids, and other circulating water systems and h as plant bactericides and fungicides. Compounds of the invention also possess useful antifungal activity, for example, Candida albicans orTrichophyton mentagrophytes, and algicidal and anti yeast activity. According to a further feature of the invention there are provided antibacterial or antifungal compositions comprising a compound of the formula VIII 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 wherein R , R , R , R , R , R , R , R andX have the meanings stated above, or an acid addition salt therof, and an inert diluent or carrier therefor. The antibacterial or antifungal compositions of the invention are prepared by conventional means using conventional excipients. They include, for example, aqueous solutions, for example concentrated aqueous solutions, sterile, ready to use aqueous solutions, aqueous dispersions, and emulsions, for example oil inwater emulsions, for example aqueous gels, creams, ointments and pastes. Suitable excipients include, for example, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, gelling agents or thickening agents. According to a further feature of the invention, there is provided a contraceptive method which comprises applying to sperm or the locus of sperm, a spermicidal, sperm immobilising or mucospissic amount of a compound of the invention of the formula VIII. In one aspect of this method, the compound of the formula VIII, when applied to the vaginal mucus at suitable concentration, very rapidly increases its viscosity, to the extent that it becomes essentially impenetrable to sperm, and forms a physical barrier to conception in the same way as a rubber sheath or a diaphragm cap. Besides increasing the viscosity of vaginal mucus, when the mucus comes into contact with a bisbiguanide compound of the formula VIII, other changes occur in its intrinsic properties, such as its morphology, rheology and water uptake and visco elastic properties, which can also effect its penetrability to sperm. The compounds also possess spermicidal or sperm immobilising properties. In vitro, the compounds of the formula VIII exert a useful contraceptive effect at concentrations 3 4 down to about 10 to 10 , and a suitable amount to be applied to the human vagina for contraceptive purposes 4 is from 1.0g. to 10 g. The compound of the formula VIII may be applied to the vagina in conventional manner, for example as a pessary, cream, liquid douche, gel, aerosol foam or impregnated tampon, or in a controlled delivery device of the compound in a polymer matrix. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a bisbiguanide compound of the formulaVIII, or a composition thereof, for use as a contraceptive. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which the temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. Medium pressure liquid chromatography MPLC was on Merck Lichoprep RP 18, or C18 column eluting with aqueous methanol. Fractions containing bisbiguanide were detected by UV absorption at 236 nm., 25000 for products in which each biguanide group bears one substituent in addition to the linking group X, or 245 nm, G 32000 for products bearing two such substituents.Example 1 An intimate mixture of 1,4 phenylenebis 2methylthioethylamine dihydrochloride 1.1 g. and 3cyano l isopropylguanidine 1.26 g. was heated at 1600 bath temperature for 2 hours. The cooled reaction mixture was dissolved in methanol 10 ml. and the solution was filtered. The filtrate was added to acetone 150 ml. and the crystalline precipitate was collected to give 4,4 p phenylenebisE3 thiabutyl 5 isopropyl biguanide dihydrochloride m.p. 172 1740.
