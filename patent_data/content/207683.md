# A compensating cable for an elevator or the like.

## Abstract
A compensating cable 2 for an elevator 8 or the like comprising at least one elongated strength member 9 dis posed in an elongatged sheath 11 together with elongated means 14 14 , 17 17 , made from a mixture of metal particles 13 embedded in a plastics material 12 occupies part of the volume of the sheath and a plurality of elongated fibres 10 occupy that volume of the sheath not occupied by the elon gated strength member or the elongated means made from metal particles embedded in plastics material the elongated particles being adapted to move relative to one another, the elongated strength member and the elongated sheath, having a coefficient of elongation or not more than 30 and a coeffi cient of friction relative to all surrounding materials.
