# GAS DISCHARGE DEVICE FOR GENERATING ACOUSTIC PULSES

## Abstract
Methods and devices are disclosed for generating acoustic pulses in a water or land medium, e.g., for use in seismic investigations. The pulse amplitudes, wave shapes, and frequencies can be controlled by signals that may originate at a remote location. Compressed gas is confined at high pressure in a valve chamber 12, 194 . An initiating signal causes the opening of a pas sage 54, 56, 192 from the chamber into the medium to initiate the rise of a pressure pulse therein. A second signal causes the closing of the passage in a manner such that the initial rise of the pressure pulse is limited by the closure of the passage. In one device, the pas sage is opened by one sleeve valve member 60 and closed by another sleeve valve member 58 . In another device the passage is opened by a sleeve valve member 196 whose motion to open the passage is arrested substantially instantaneously by transferring its momen tum to a momentum exchange sleeve 246 that is then gradually decelerated. The passage may be closed by the same sleeve valve member 196 whose motion to close the passage is arrested substantially instanta neously by transferring its momentum to a second mo mentum exchange sleeve 220 that is then gradually decelerated.
