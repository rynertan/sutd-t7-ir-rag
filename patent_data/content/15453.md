## Description
SYNERGISTIC HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING UNDESIRABLE VEGETATION. The protection of crops from weeds and other vegetation which inhibit crop growth by consuming valuable acreage or soil nutrients is a constantly recurring problem in agriculture. To help combat this problem, researchers in the field of synthetic chemistry have produced an extensive variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in the control of such unwanted growth. Chemical herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a large number are in commercial use. In many cases, active herbicides have been shown to be more effective in combination than when applied individually. The result is often termed synergism , since the combination demonstrates a potency or activity level exceeding that which it would be expected to have, based on a knowledge of the individual potencies of the components. The present invention resides in the discovery that certain pyrrolidones and certain phosphonic acids, already known individually for their herbicidal potency, display this synergistic effect when applied in combination. The two classes of compounds forming the combination which is the subject of the present invention are independently known in the art as active herbicides. Pyrrolidones are disclosed as herbicides in U.S. Patent No.4 110 105 Teach, August 29, 1979 , and phosphonic acids are similarly disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3 853 530 Franz, Decembre 10, 1974 , No. 3 799 758 Franz, March 26, 1974 , and No. 3 929 450 Hamm, Decembre 30, 1975 , as well as numerous other references including Maynard et al., Organophosphorus Compounds.

In the compositions of the present invention, pyrrolidones of the following formula are preferred EMI2.3 in which R2 is trifluoromethyl or cyano. The term alkyl as usen herain includes both stright chain and branhec crain grobss. The carbon canges are intended to be inclusive oss sth ubber and lower limits. The terms syanergism and synergistic are used herein to convey the esult osservad when a combination of herbicides demonstrates a potency in excess o that whren the combination wou 5e expected to produce on the of the potencies of each herbicide applied individually. The term herbicide is used nerein to denote a compound which controls or modifies the growth of plants. The term herbicidally effective amount is used to indicate the quantity of such a compound or combination of such compounds which is capable of producing a controlling or modifying effect. Controlling or modifying effects include all deviations from natural development, for example, killing, retardation, defoliation, desiccation, regulation, stunting, tillering, stimulating, leaf burn, dwarfing and the like. The term plants is used to include germinating seeds, emerging seedlings and established vehetation, including roots and above ground portions. rn the composirions of this invention, the pyrrollidone phosphonic acid weight ratio at which the herbicidal response is synergistic lies within the ranqe r about 0.1 1 to about 20 1, preferably about 0.1 1 to t 10 Apt cation rates will deeend upon the weeds to be controlled and the degree o. control desired. In general, the compotions of this invention are most efficiently employed at a rate of 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre 0.011 to 56 klograms per hectar of the active ingredient, preferably 0.1 to 25 pcnuds per acre 0.11 to 28 kilograms per hectare .

These and other substituted phosphonic acids within the scope of the invention can be prepared by the procedures described in U.S. Patent No.3 799 758 and the Maynard et al. articles mentioned above. The following examples provide further illustration demonstrating the synergistic herbicidal response of the present compositions. EXAMPLE 1 This example demonstrates the synergistic response of 1 m trifluoromethylphenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone and 2 chloroethylphosphonic acid in combined postemergence application to a veriety of weeds. Aluminum flats measuring 15.2 22.9 7.0 centimeters cm were filled to a depth of 5.0 cm with loamy sand soil containing 50 parts per million ppm each of the commercial fungicide cis N trichloromethyl thio 4 cyclo hexene 1,2 dicarboximide Cptan and 18 18 18 fertilizer percentages ofN P205 K20 on a weight basis . Several rows were impressed across the width of each flat and each row was seeded with a single weed species.The weed species included yellow nut sledge Cyperus esculentus , nightshade Solanum nigrwn , johnsongrass Sorghum haZopense wild oat Avena fatua . velvetleaf AbutiZon theophrasti , v jimsonweed Datura stramonium and a annual morning glory Ipomoea purpurea .Ample seeds were planted to give about 20 to 50 seedlings per row after emergence depending on the size of the plants. The flats were then placed in a greenhouse for two weeks, where they were watered regularly. At the end of this period, the foliage on the emergent weeds was sprayed with aqueous solutions of the test compounds.The quantities sprayed were such that the amount of each test compound applied per flat corresponded to the desired application rate in pounds per acre.In control flats, the test compounds were applied alone at various application rates, whereas in the test flats, solutions containing both compounds were applied. Additional flats not treated at all were used as a standard for measuring the extent of weed control occuring in the treated flats. Three weeks after treatment, the control and test flats were compared to the standard and each row was rated visually in terms of percent control ranging from 0 to 100 , with 0 representing the same degree of growth as the same row in the standard and 100 representing complete kill of all weeds in the row. All types of plant injury were taken into consideration. The results of these tests are listed in Table I herein after, in the columns headed by the symbol 0 indicating the observed results .These results are compared with the expected results, shown in the columns headed by the symbol E , derived from the control date usingLimpel s formula Limpel and al., 1962, Weed Control by Dimethylchloroterephtalate Alone and in Certain Combinations , Proc. NEWCC, Vol. 16, pp. 48 53 E X y 1XY 100 where X observed percent injury when one of the herbicides is used alone, and Y observed percent injury when the other herbicide is used alone. An at asterisk is is used to indicate the tests where the results show synergism, i.e., where the observed result exceeds the expected result.Since synergism can only be detected when the expected result is less than 100, tests where both the E and 0 values are 100 are left blank. It is clear from the table that synergisms was widely evident over the entire range of application rates tested.

EXAMPLE 2 In this example, the same herbicides used in Example 1 were used.Here, however, the pyrrolidone was applied in pre emergence fashion it was sprayed over the soil surface on the same day on which the weed seeds were planted, i.e., before the weeds were able to emerge from the soil. The phosphonic acid was applied in postemergence fashion as inExample 1. The application rates were varied somewhat to show a wider range and the injury ratings were taken four weeks after planting rather than five. Otherwise, the procedure were identical to those of Example I. The results are shown in Table II herein after, where a strong degree of synergism is evident at higher application rates. EXAMPLE 3 This example demonstrates the synergistic response of l m trifluoro methylphenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone and N phosphonomethylglycine in combined post emergence application. The weed species used in this test included shattercane Sorghum bicoZor and n annual ryegrass LoZiwn mu itiflorum as well as the yellow nutsedge, wild oat, johnsongrass, and morning glory species listed above.Fiber flats were used rather than aluminum. The emergent weeds were treated three weeks after seeding and injury ratings were taken four weeks later.Otherwise, the procedure was the same as that described in Example 1. The results are shown in Table III herein after, where a strong degree of synergism is evident in many of the tests.

EXAMPLE 4 The same herbicides tested in Example III were tested in the data shown in this example, the main difference being that the pyrrolidone was applied pre emergence, rather than postemergence with the phosphonic acid.The latter was applied two weeks after planting, and injury ratings were taken two weeks later. The procedure was otherwise identical to that ofExample 1. The results are shown in Table IV, herein after, where.synerism is indicated at all application rates. EXAMPLE 5 The tests shown in this example were run with l m cyanophenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone and N phosphonomethylglycine in combined postemergence application. The weed species included watergrass foxtail in addition to the wild oat, x yellow nutsedge, annual morning glory, and annual ryegrass previously tested, in fiber flats. The weeds were treated ten days after seeding, and injury ratings were taken 17 days later. Since the tests were performed during the winter season, low growth rates occurred rendering comparisons with the standard more difficult.Synergism, however, is shown in many of the tests results, which are listed in Table V herein after.

The compositions of this invention are useful as herbicides demonstrating synergistic activity for the control of undesirable vegetation. The compositions can be formulated in the same manner in which herbicides are generally formulated. The compounds may be applied either separately or combined as part of a two part herbicidal system. The object of the formulation is to apply the compositions to the locus where control is desired by a convenient method. The locus may include soil, seeds, seedlings, and vegetation. Formulations will generally contain several additives. Among these are some inert ingredients and diluent carriers such as organic solvents, water, oil and water, water in oil emulsions, carriers of dust and granules, and surface active, wetting, dispersing, and emulsifying agents. Fertilizers, e.g., ammonium nitrate, urea and superphosphate may also be added. Aids to rooting and growth, e.g., compost, manure, humus, sand, etc., may likewise be added. The formulations are commonly dusts, wettable powders, granules, solutions of emulsifiable concentrates. Dusts are free flowing powder compositions containing the herbicidal compound impregnated on a particulate carrier. The particle size of the carrier is usually in the approximate range of 30 to 5P microns.Examples of suitable carriers are talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, and pyrophyllite. Anticaking and antistatic agents can be added, if desired. The composition generally contains up to 50 of active ingredient. Dusts, like liquid compositions, can be applied from boom and hand or power sprayers or airplanes. Wettable powders are finely divided compositions comprising a particulate carrier impregnated with the herbicide compound and additionally containing one or more surface active agents. The surface active agent promotes rapid dispersion of the powder in aqueous medium to form stable, sprayable suspensions. A wide variety of surface active agents can be used, for example, long chain fatty alcohols salts of sulfonic acid esters of long chain fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols in which the alcohol groups are free, omega substituted polyethylene glycols of relatively long chain length. A list of surface active agents suitable for use in agriculture formulations can be found in Wade Van Valkenburg, Pesticide Formulations Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1973 at pages 79 84.
