## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, more particularly to a semiconductor memory device having a redundancy circuit. There is known a semiconductor memory device consisting of a combination of a random access memory RAM and a shift register group. This type of semiconductor memory device is, in general, used as an image memory. The shift register group is attached to the RAM for high speed read out of the data stored therein. The RAM is, for example, provided between a central processing unit CPU and a cathode ray tube display CRT . The data stored in the RAM is read out in parallel to the shift registers in accordance with control of a system. The read out data is output serially from the shift register group to the CRT. IBM T.D.B., Vol. 24, No. 9, pp 4776 8, discloses a system for dynamic allocation of redundant memory components in a multiple bit output memory device, having features corresponding to those of the preamble of accompanying claim 1. A defective memory array element and its associated I O circuitry are replaced as a whole by a redundant memory array element and I O circuity thereafter, defective data is blocked and replaced by data from the redundant memory array element before reaching a data bus. EP A 0 030 245 by the present applicant discloses a random access memory device with provision for replacing a defective memory cell by a redundant memory cell. However, this memory device does not include a serial output means and therefore does not provide redundancy control of a serial output mode. IBM T.D.B., Vol. 13, No. 7, pp 1880 1, discloses a redundancy scheme for a shift register memory, including a so called reconfiguring shift register which stores information identifying a defective memory shift register. The data intended for the defective memory shift register is handled by a redundant memory shift register. Even in view of the above disclosures, there is still no known RAM having both random access and serial data output functions and a redundancy function. According to the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising The embodiment of the present invention provides a semiconductor memory device which enables both low speed random access by a CPU and high speed serial data transmission between RAM and a CRT. It also provides a circuit giving a redundancy function to a semiconductor memory device. Such a redundancy circuit enables an increase of the yield in production of semiconductor memory devices. The embodiment of the present invention provides a semiconductor memory device having a serial output means for high speed read out of data and a redundancy circuit for raising the yield. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which A semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 represents a column decoder, 2 a row decoder, 3 an image memory RAM , 4 a multiplexer, 5 a counter, 6 a redundancy read only memory redundancy ROM , and 7 a comparator. Reference letters SA₁ to SA In this embodiment, a redundancy circuit is constituted by the drive circuit DC₁ , the redundancy sense amplifier RSA, the redundancy amplifier RA, the multiplexer 4, the counter 5, the redundancy ROM 6, and the comparator 7. In the inspection of the manufacture of the RAM, when a defective column is found, the column address indicating the defective column is stored in the redundancy ROM and the redundancy ROM is enabled. That is, the redundancy ROM 6 is enabled to provide the column address or addresses corresponding to the defective column or columns of the RAM 3. Storage of the defective column address in the redundancy ROM 6 may be performed by cutting a polycrystalline silicon fuse. There are two known methods for cutting a polycrystalline silicon fuse, i.e., one utilizing a laser beam and another method utilizing electrical current. A semiconductor memory device according to the present invention basically operates such that, when a defective column in the RAM is accessed by an address ADD sent from the CPU, this defective column is replaced by a redundancy column in the RAM, indicated by slanted lines in Figure 1. That is, an area of the memory is reserved for the redundancy function. Accordingly, even if a defective column is found in the RAM, the device can operate as a normal memory. The operation of tie device of Figure 1 will now be explained in detail. If a defect is found in the column corresponding to, for example, the sense amplifier SA₂ , the corresponding column address is stored in the redundancy ROM 6. In the random access mode, in read out when the input address ADD from the CPU is applied to the column decoder 1 and the comparator 7, if no defective column address is included in the input address, data corresponding to the input address is output from the RAM to the data bus DB through the corresponding sense amplifiers and output from the amplifier AMP₀. In writing, write data corresponding to the input address is input to the RAM from the data bus DB. Assume a defective column address corresponding to the sense amplifier SA₂ is included in the input address. The comparator 7 compares the input column addresses with the stored defective column address in the redundancy ROM 6. As one of the input column addresses coincides with the stored defective column address, a coincidence signal COM is input to the drive circuit DC₁ and an inverted coincidence signal In the serial output mode, data stored in the RAM is simultaneously read out in parallel to the shift registers SR₁ to SR The data replacement operation in the multiplexer 4 will be explained in more detail below. As mentioned above, the defective column address is previously stored in the redundancy ROM 6. That is, the number of the defective column counted from the final column final shift register SR The clock signal S When the transfer gate control signal STG is ON, all transfer gates TG are simultaneously turned ON so as to transfer the data in the RAM in parallel to the shift registers SR₁ to SR Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram of a semiconductor memory device according to another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2, the same reference numerals and letters as in Fig. 1 indicate the same elements. In this embodiment, a decoder 8, flip flop circuits FF₁ to FF As mentioned above, the defective column address is previously stored in the redundancy ROM 6. In this embodiment, in the random access mode, the same read write operations of the redundancy column as the redundancy column shown in Fig. 1 are performed. Accordingly, explanations of the operations will be omitted. In the serial output mode, when data corresponding to the defective column is read out from the RAM to one of the shift registers, for example, to the shift register SR₂ , the defective data is compulsorily replaced by the correct data sent from the redundancy amplifier RA through the redundancy data bus RDB and the gate G₂ in the first next shift operation. That is, information regarding the defective column address stored in the redundancy ROM 6 is applied to the decoder 8. The decoder sets the corresponding flip flop circuit. In this case, the flip flop circuit FF₂ is set by the decoder 8. Since all flip flop circuits FF₁ to FF Accordingly, as explained above, the correct data latched in the redundancy amplifier RA is sent to the output of the shift register SR₂ through the data bus RDB and the defective data is replaced with the correct data. Consequently, the correct serial outputs can be obtained from the final shift register SR Figure 3 is a schematic block diagram of a semiconductor memory device according to another embodiment of the present invention. In this case, a new redundancy column slanted lines portion in the Figure is added to the memory area in the RAM 3. As can be understood, the yield of devices can be raised by the addition of the new redundancy column over the single redundancy column shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 3, reference letter m represents an m bit address. With the addition of the new redundancy column, the redundancy sense amplifier RSA₂ , the drive circuit DC₂ , the comparator COMP4, and the redundancy ROM 2 are newly added to the redundancy circuit. In the same way as explained above, a second defective column address is previously stored in the redundancy ROM 2. Of course, the first defective column address is previously stored in the redundancy ROM 1. In this embodiment, in the random access mode, the same read write operations of the redundancy columns as the redundancy column shown in Fig. 1 are performed. Accordingly, explanation of the operations will be omitted. Reference letters PR₁ to PR₂m represent so called pointers functioning as a ring counter in the serial output mode. Reference letters FF₁ to FF₂m represent flip flop circuits. These pointers and flip flop circuits perform the same function as the shift register group shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Each of the pointers PR₁ to PR₂m can shift the signal 1 in response to the clock signal S If defective data is latched in the flip flop circuit FF₂ for example, then when the pointer PR₂ becomes 1 , the gate G₂ is turned ON and the defective data is sent to the multiplexer MPX through an amplifier AMP₁. Also, when the pointer PR₂ becomes 1 , the gate G In this case, as explained in Fig. 1, the coincidence signal SCOM1 is generated when the comparator COMP1 compares the number of the defective column address stored in the redundancy ROM 1 with the number of the m bit counter and detects coincidence therebetween. The m bit counter is preset by the transfer gate signal STG. As can be understood, the same explanations apply to the second redundancy column using the redundancy ROM 2, a comparator COMP2, and a coincidence signal SCOM2. This method using pointers can reduce power consumption compared with the method using shift registers shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This is because each shift register must sequentially transfer data to the next shift register. Conversely, only one selected pointer and flip flop need transfer data to the output. Figure 4 is a schematic block diagram of a semi conductor memory device according to still another embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 4, the same structure as that of Fig. 3 is applied for the random access mode. In the serial output mode, the shift data bus SDB is used instead of a redundancy data bus RDB. Accordingly, the redundancy data bus RDB is eliminated and the redundancy flip flop circuits RFF₁ and RFF₂ are connected to the shift data bus SDB through the gates G In this embodiment, the gate corresponding to the defective data, for example, the gate G₂ , is not turned ON since the corresponding pointer PR₂ does not output the signal 1 . In this case, all pointers become 0 because the clock signal S
