# Method for forming a copper based metal pattern.

## Abstract
A composite mask 5A, 6A is formed by sequentially depositing blanket layers 5 and 6 of molybdenum and of a material respectively selected from the group consisting of MgO and Al₂O₃ on the surface of a copper layer 3 , and producing in these layers 5 and 6 a pattern of openings corresponding to the negative of the desired copper pattern 3 . Using said mask 5A, 6A the portions of copper layer 3 exposed in said openings are removed, preferably by dry etching. MgO or Al₂O₃ adhere well to Mo and Mo adheres well to copper. The Mo layer 5A also serves as a diffusion barrier for the copper. The method is applicable in forming copper intercon nect metallurgy for components such as semiconductor or dielectric substrates.
