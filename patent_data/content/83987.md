# Tilting pad thrust bearing.

## Abstract
Each bearing pad 15, 16 in a circular array of pads is held in a retainer 10 and is provided with a radially extending rib on the side opposite of the side that receives the thrust load. There are disks 24 that have a planar surface on one side and a spherical surface on an axially opposite side. The respective ribs of the pads 15, 16 bear on the planar surfaces of the disks 24 . The spherical surfaces of the disks 24 bear on angulated wings of two adjacent leveling links in a circular array of links. The links have radial holes and are supported for pivoting on pins 41 that extend radially from the retainer 10 . The periphery of each pin 41 makes tangential line contact with a hole. An extrapolation of the angulated wing surfaces extends through the line contact so there is no moment arm for frictional forces at the point contact on the wings to act through and free pivoting of the leveling link is not impaired.
