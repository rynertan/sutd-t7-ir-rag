# Radio communication system.

## Abstract
A radio communication system comprised of a transmit ter unit, a transmission line, and a receiver unit. The transmitter unit modulates an in phase channel I ch data signal and quadrature channel Q ch data signal with two carriers having Ï€ 2 phase difference with each other. A DC offset is added to either one of the I ch and Q ch data signals before the modulation. In the receiver unit, a demodulation operation is performed for the received transmission signal through a synchronous detection with the use of a leakage carrier created due to the DC offset and included in the transmission signal.
