# DEVICE FOR TREATING A WALL E.G. A SHIP S WALL

## Abstract
A device for treating a wall, for example, a ship s wall comprising a supporting device having a head 3 movable along the wall and an elongate carrier connected with the head and carrying processing members. The carrier com prises a basic segment 12 connected with the head and a plurality of relatively pivotable, elongate segments 13 16 connected with one another and with the basic segment to form a chain on at least one side of the basic segment. Moving and guiding means 21, 20 are provided for the pivotable movements of the segments relative to one another, the guiding means 20 comprising a bearing support 25 rigidly secured to the basic segment, a bearing support 24 rigidly secured to the second segment 14 , viewed from the basic segment 12 , and a coupling rod 26 pivotally connected with said bearing supports. The coupling rod 26 and the first segment 13 define a non parallelogram shaped four bar linkage. The moving means comprise a hydraulic jack 21 arranged between a bearing support rigidly secured to the basic segment and a bearing support rigidly secured to one of the plurality of segments.
