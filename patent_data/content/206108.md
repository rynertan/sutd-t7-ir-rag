# Process for producing electrical steel sheet.

## Abstract
A process for the production of an electrical steel sheet having the ideal 100 001 cube texture of iron or iron alloy, comprising cold rolling a sheet of a single crystal or large grained crystals of iron or iron alloy, in which said single crystal is or a majority of said large grained crystals are oriented so that the pole of the 114 plane may form an angle not greater than 15 with the normal direction of the plane of the sheet, and the 401 direction may form an angle not greater than 15 with a single direction in the plane of the sheet, in said single direction at a rolling reduction of at least 40 , and annealing the rolled sheet to form a primary recrystallization texture of fine grains of an average grain size of not larger than 5 mm un der conditions preventing the occurrence of secondary recrys tallization.
