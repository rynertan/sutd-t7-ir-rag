# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FRAGMENTING FRANGIBLE OBJECTS

## Abstract
Apparatus for fragmenting brittle or other breakable objects, such as scrap metal castings or rock, includes a pivoted first crushing member 20, 50 and a fixed second crushing member 14, 54 . The first member has a plurality of crushing regions 23, 24, 27 located at various distances from the pivot axis 26 , which is offset, so that each successive crushing region approaches the second member closer than the preceding crushing region. The object is fragmented by a combination of compression and shear forces. Projections 27 may be provided to localise the forces, and loose members such as chains 56 may be utilised to dislodge adherent fragments from within the apparatus.
