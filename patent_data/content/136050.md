# Method of bonding crystalline silicon bodies.

## Abstract
A method of bonding two single crystal silicon bodies com prises the steps of i mirror polishing the contact surfaces of the bodies to reduce the surface roughness to 500A or less ii removing contaminant from the mirror polished surfaces and iii bringing the surfaces into mutual contact so that substantially no foreign substance enter the gap between these surfaces.
