# Var generator having controlled discharge of thyristor switched capacitors.

## Abstract
A device for controlling the residual charge on a thyristor switched capacitor. A capacitor in series circuit with at least two bidirectional back to back thyristor switches connected across an AC network. Each back to back thyristor switch is shunted by a non linear clamping device. A pulse stretcher and a sequential firing circuit arrangement is used to prolong the conduction of one of the thyristor switches at a time to allow the shunting of its associated clamping device.
