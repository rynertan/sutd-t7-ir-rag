# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING RESISTANCE WELDING.

## Abstract
Method of controlling resistance welding to obtain a high quality of welding in which the pressure between the electrodes 2a, 2b olding the materials 1a, 1b to be welded is controlled o that the resistance value between the two electrodes 2a, b is a predetermined value, and the welding current is regulated so that the voltage between the electrodes is a predetermined value, and the time during which the welding current flows is controlled to a fixed period.
