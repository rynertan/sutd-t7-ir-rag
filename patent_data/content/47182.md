## Description
PERSONAL OR BUSINESS CALLING CARD This invention relates to calling cards of the type commonly used in business as well as by individuals. Business and personal information such as names, addresses, etc. of a personal or professional nature are commonly conveyed by means of business and personal calling cards. Such cards are normally available in the form of a rectangular card board which is approximately 10 centimeters long and 5 centimeters wide. The various information relating to the carholder is generally printed on one face of the card. Sometimes, it is desired to add written information to the card. The common technique of presenting such cards to third parties, be they persons or organizations, is very simple and practical. It makes it possible in effect to transfer this information in an instantaneous, complete and inexpensive manner.Furthermore, information relating to the card holder is in effect memorized on the card and remains in the possession of the card receiver as long as the card is not thrown away. However, the use of such cards does suffer from a certain number of inconveniences which are principally related to their fixed nature, which is incompatible with the majority of interpersonal and business relationship necessities. Thus, depending upon the situation and the type of relationship which the card holder has with the people to which the card is to be presented, the cardholder is required to transfer information such as a personal information, such as his identity, his address and his private telephone number, and the various coordinates of his club b information relating to his professional and or personal background, such as his titles and degrees and c very often information relating to his professional activities such as the telephone numbers of organizations which he represents and the addresses and possibly the logos and emblems of these organizations. As a result, one is often forced to carry a personal calling card and one or more professional calling cards. In effect, to systematically communicate ones personal coordinates to ones clients leads to intrusions in ones private life. Furthermore, one imposes upon ones friends by listing ones degrees which may appear useless and pretentious. Additionally, by giving ones cards to certain personal contacts which contain information relating to ones professional activities, ones business activities may be disrupted. Furthermore, in the case where one exercises several professional activities, it is presently necessary to possess several calling cards to avoid any confusion. The receiver of the calling cards must, depending upon his activities, distribute, in more than one copy, the information given by the card holder to his different classification systems so as to preserve them and to be able to retrieve them rapidly when necessary. To do this, the receiver of a business card must recopy the information transmitted in the different alphabetical indices which he uses, as well as in his files and pertinent address books. Thus, when a businessman makes initial contact with a vendor through one of the vendor s employees, if the employee gives the businessman his business card, the businessman must recopy or manually copy the information furnished and classify it in his different alphabetical indices, i.e. a under the name of the firm concerned so as to be able to rapidly reach the firm and b under the name of the employee, the card bearer, so as to be able to enter into direct contact with him if the businessman so desires. Furthermore, if the receiver may desire to reach the cardholder for personal reasons, he may recopy this information into his personal diary or address book. Finally, if the card receiver is very methodical, after having used and recopied this information, he will place the business card in a classifier specially adapted to contain such cards. The totality of these tasks is very long and tedious. Thus, it often happens that the card receiver postpones the task of transferring the information into his various files and that the card is ultimately lost in the meantime, before it could be used by the card receiver or indeed that the card itself is thrown away shortly after having been received. This situation is very disruptive to the development of business and personal relationships. According to the invention there is provided a personal or business calling card which is rigid and carries information thereon characterized in that the card comprises a base with an anti stick surface with an information bearing slip detachably secured to the anti stick surface. The present invention allows the above described disadvantages in using known calling cards to be overcome providing a new type of business or personal card which is more versatile while yet being both simple and sufficiently similar to conventional cards so as not to disturb the habits of users. The previously tedious operations of recording the information transmitted by conventional cards into the different files, alphabetical indices and address books of the card receiver can be reduced to simple separations of slips which are secured with self adhesive glues. Further there can be provided a single complete and concise card which includes a substantial ensemble of descriptive information of the card holder which is easily modifiable by the card holder and which allows him to adapt a single card to a multiplicity of situations and to various potential card receivers whom he meets. Thus, by provision of suitable detachably secured information bearing slips, the card holder can remove from this card, without altering its appearance, the information which he judges inappropriate for communication to a given potential receiver. According to the invention, a modular card is provided for use as a business or personal identification card. The card includes information as to the card bearer and comprises a base support and at least one information module detachably secured to the base support. The receiver of the card may separate the at least one information module from the base support for purposes of classifying the information module separately from the base support while the card bearer can remove the information modules to suit his needs prior to distributing the card. The information contained in the information module may relate to the identity, address, private telephone number, professional telephone number, background, title, degree or profession of the card bearer or the firm represented by the card bearer, its telephone number, telex, address or logo. In one embodiment, the card contains at least two information modules. The base support may be rigid and have at least one anti stick surface. The information modules may comprise an adhesive slip adapted to be detachably removed from the anti stick surface of the basesupport. Additionally, at least one of the surfaces of the base support may itself have information thereon. In yet another embodiment of the invention, each surface of the base support comprises at least one adhesive slip constituting the detachable information module mounted thereon. According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the base support comprises a base plate and the card further comprises a layer adhesively secured to at least one of the surfaces of the baseplate. The exterior surface of the layer is antistick. Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clear from the description which follows, given by way of reference to the annexed drawings, in which the description and drawings are in no way limiting and are given by way of example only. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a multimodular business card according to one preferred embodiment of the invention in which certain modules have been partially detached from one another Figure 2 is a partial cross sectional view, along the longitudinal axis of the card shown inFigure 1 Figure 3 illustrates a perspective view of the multi modular business card partially disassembled and formed according to another emdodiment of the invention Figure 4 is a partial cross sectional view along the longitudinal axis of the card shown inFigure 3 Figure 5 is a perspective view, according to another embodiment, of a multi modular business card partially folded and disassembled and Figure 6 schematically compares different methods of utilizing a conventional business or personal carrying card and a card formed according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The invention essentially provides a modular personal or business card. The different modules are constituted in a fashion so as to be easily detachable from one another. Each module carries a sub assembly of information inscribed on the card. According to one preferred embodiment of the card of the invention, the modules are constituted of adhesive slips positioned on a rigid base support having the format of a carrying card. Means are provided for rendering the support non adhesive in a fashion such that the slips are easily detachable therefrom. Furthermore, according to the invention, it is suggested that the information relating to the card holder and written on the card be divided into the different modules according to different classifications. Each classificaion comprises one type of specific information which a relates to one or several personal or professional characteristic s of the card holder and b is adapted to fall under one particular classification mode of intended receivers. Individual modules can relate in particular to one or more of the following characteristics a the firm s emp oying the card holder and corresponding information to be classified by the receiver under the index of the firm s represented b a professional profileof the card holder summarizing in particular his professional training, his degrees and his different responsibilities which the intended receiver may classify under the corresponding index under the initials of the card holder c purely personal information which the card receiver can enter into his calender and d other information of any nature relating to a particular characteristic of the card holder. As may be seen from Figure 1, a calling card according to the invention is illustrated in which the bearer is Mr. John C. Barton. This card comprises an anti stick support base 1. On this support are positioned, parallel to the axis of the card, several detachable joined slips 2, 3 and 4, whose rear surfaces are self adhesive. These slips are formed by incision of an initial sheet. Information which relates to the bearer of the card John C. Barton is printed on labels 2, 3 and 4, as well as on the support base 1. Since the information carried by each of these portions, is not of the same nature it is distributed differently. Thus, a slip or label 3 is headed by the name of the bearer 3a. It is further noted that a list of the bearer s degrees 3b and his professional position 3c within the firm 3d where he is employed are shown. The address and various other identifying information of the firm are included as well. Thus, the address of the firm 3e and 3f as well as its Post Office Box 3g, and telephone number 3h and telex number 3i are all listed. This slip includes, therefore information of a professional nature relating to the card bearer. Likewise, strip 2, which likewise includes the name of the card bearer, includes both the professional data 3d and personal information 2c. Finally, slip 4 containing the name of the firm employing the card bearer 4d contains information relating to this firm. Slip 4 contains the various coordinates 3b and 4c of the firm as well as the position of the card bearer within the firm 4d. As may be seen from Figure 2, the support base comprises a rigid support 5 covered with an anti stick film 6 made of paraffin or the like. The adhesive slips deposited on the support are made of flexible paper strips 7 covered on their surface which faces the support base with a film of a selfadhesive product 8. Each slip can thus be detached without alteration of the supports and may be adhesively secured to another substrate at another location. It will be noted that if all of the slips are removed from their support 1, the support assumes the appearance of a conventional rigid business card on which all of the information relative to the donor which are printed on the slip 3 may be found.This information is printed beneath the anti stick film 6 which is transparent. A card having an outward appearance similar to the card previously described is shown in Figure 3. However, this type of card is different from the preceding card in its design. This difference may be better understood with reference to the cross sectional view of the card shown in Figure 4.The card comprises a support base 5 on which is adhesively secured, by means of an adhesive film 9, a skin layer 10 covered with an anti stick product 11. In this figure, the adhesive layer is partially lifted away and separated into a layer 9a remaining integral with the support and a layer 9b adhering to the layer 10. The assembly 5, 9 and 10 constitutes the anti stick support base 11. Three adhesive slips 2, 3 and 4 similar to those described above are positioned on the front surface of the support base 11. The slips comprise the same inscriptions 2a 2c, 3a 3i and 4a 4d as noted above. Furthermore, information analogous to that found on slip 3 is printed on the rear surface 12 of the support base. This information, given under the name of the card bearer, summarizes the professional activities of the card bearer while the front surface 13 of the support base is blank. However, it is likewise possible to form a card whose two faces comprise detachable information modules according to the invention. Thus, as in the card previously described, when all of the adhesive slips have been separated from the support base, the support base constitutes in effect a conventional business card. The value of the type of card previously described should be appreciated particularly with respect to the cost of manufacture. In effect, large quantities of anti stick layers 10 and 11 are presently produced cheaply and in large quantities which are covered wih a film of self adhesive paper 7 and 8. These are utilized in particular in the manufacture of self sticking slips which are very popular. On the contrary, it is relatively uncommon and, therefore, more costly to cover supports, particularly cardboard supports, by means of anti stick products such as has been described above. The card shown in Figure 5 is an alternative embodiment of the type of card described in Figures 1 and 2. In effect, the front portion of this card possesses exactly the same characteristics as have been described above. Yet, the rear portion of the base 11 is covered with an anti stick film 14. A sheet of flexible paper 15 whose surface which faces the support base is covered with a self adhesive film 16 is positioned on the rear surface of the support base.This sheet is partially lifted off of the base inFigure 5. The other surface of this sheet 15 is printed. The information carried is presented in the name of the card bearer, his wife 17 and children 18. The personal address etc. of the card bearer 19 is printed on the lower portion of sheet 15. This concise and complete card can, therefore, as desired by tbe card bearer, be transformed into a business card by separatingit from the rear layer or into a personal identification card by removing certain strips deposited on the front surface of the card. Figure 6 allows for a comparison between the manner of use of the business cards conventionally received and those cards formed according to the invention. In a hypothetical situation, Mr. John C.Barton, the card bearer and managing director ofTomil Engineering Company, has contacted the CMICompany to offer his services to CMI in response to job offer announcement 12,224 which was announced byCMI. Mr. Barton has given his business card to a member of CMI. Considering first a business card 20 of the conventional type, the intended receiver of the card must copy or manually copy the information provided by the card into the various files and indices in which such information is to be recorded. The possible classification modes are symbolically shown by the address book 21. The files are symbolically shown by the offer announcement 22. Some of the information must be copied over manually for it to be classified as needed by the user. Specifically, Mr. Barton s name must be copied in under the letter B into address ook 21 dashed line f . The employer of the card bearer, i.e. Tomil Engineering Company, must be copied onto the address book 21 under the letter T dashed line g and all of the information must be provided in file 22 dashed line h . Card 20 could then ultimately be classified in the card classifier 23 i or be thrown away in the garbage 24 j . If the card used is one of the type described in Figure 3, the information need not be copied over manually. Specifically, it would suffice to transfer the different slips 2, 3 and 4 carried on the support 25 and to enter them in the different address books and files. Thus, the slip 2 under the name Barton can be glued k under the letter B into address book 21 the slip 4 under the name Tomil Engineering Company can be glued 1 under the letter T of address book 21 and slip 3 including all of the informaion of the party and the firm will be glued m onto file 22. After these operations, the support 25 will have the same appearance as the card 20 and it may be inserted n in the classifier 23 or ultimately thrown away o 24. It can easily be seen that the type of personal or business card proposed by the invention makes it possible for receivers of the cards to save considerable amounts of time in classifying and recopying the information furnished on the cards while providing a greater possibility for the card bearer to have his information preserved by the card receiver. The value of the card according to the invention to the card bearer may likewise be appreciated. Thus, the card bearer need carry only a single type of card while adapting the contents of the information delivered through the card to each possible contact as a function of the use to which he wishes the information to be put. It will likewise be noted that the use of the cards according to the invention does not upset or disturb the general habits and customs of the users of such cards. In effect, they can have the same format characteristics as conventional cards and can replace them in all their uses. Of course, the preceding examples are given by way of non limiting examples and it is particularly possible to utilize the proposed characteristics in combination. Furthermore, although the invention has been described with respect to particular means, materials and embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the particulars disclosed but extends to all equivalents falling in the scope of the claims.
