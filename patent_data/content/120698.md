# PRECURSOR MATERIAL FOR CARBON ARTIFACT MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A precursor material for carbon artifact manufacture comprises pitch components blended to give a ratio by weight of oxidisable to non oxidisable products in the range 2.3 to 5.0 1. A precursor can be manufactured by blending extracted components of at least one pitch to give an optimized mixture having the proper chemistries and rheology to provide high strength carbon artifacts.
