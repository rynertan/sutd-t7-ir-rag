## Description
GENETIC EXPRESSION OP SOMATOSTATIN AS HYBRID POLYPEPTIDEThe interest in genetic expression of the peptide somatostatin 14 SS14 via genetic engineered E. coliyplasmid system has been alive for several years. The small size of somatostatin permits the design and production of a synthetic somatostatin coding gene.The amino acid sequence and the effects of somatostatin are described in US Patent 3 904 594.In Science, Vol. 198 of Dec. 9,1977, pages 1056 to 1063, KeichiITAKURA et al reported about the expression in Escherichia coli of a chemically synthesized gene for the hormone somatostatin.In said research a gene for somatostatin, a mammalian peptide hormone, was synthesized by chemical methods. This gene was fused to the Escherichia colic galactosidase gene on the plasmid pBR322. Transformation of E. coli with the chimeric plasmid DNA led to the synthesis of a polypeptide including the sequence of albino acids corresponding to somatostatin. In vitro, active somatostatin was specifically cleaved from the large chineric protein by treatment with cyanogen bromide.European Patent Application No. 1929, analogously reports on the synthesis and cloning of a scaatostatin gene within the beta galactosidase gene carried by a plasmid vector. The recoibinant plasmid inserted in an E. coli strain via genetic transfornation allows the expression of a hybrid protein between beta galactosidase and SS14. Somatostatin 14 was derived from the hybrid protein by CNBr cleavage at the Met residue that joined somatostatin with the rest of the protein.European Patent Application, Publication No. 36776, discloses another E.coli plasmid system wherein expression plasmids are provided for the production of heterologous polypeptide products in E.coli, including 55 14.The vehicles used in said publications have a Trp promoter operator, nucleotides coding for the Trp leader ribosomal binding site and nucleotides encoding translation initiation for the expression of structural genes that encode the amino acid sequence of the heterologous polypeptides. They do not contain a Trp attenuator region or nucleotides coding for theTrpE ribosozal binding site.The expressed polypeptide is a specifically cleavable, fused protein comprising 6 amino acids of the Trp leader peptide plus the last third of the TrpE polypeptide and the somatostatin 14 peptide. By tryptophan limitation the Trp operator is de repressed and highly efficient expression of the heterologous polypeptide occurs, unhampered by attenuation because the attenuator region has been deleted from the system.The present invention relates to the production of somatostatin as a hybrid with a plasmid encoded polypeptide by a strategy based on the use of the E.coli Trp promoter operator followed by the Trp leader and attenuator, the TrpE ribosomal binding site, the structural gene of about the first two thirds of theTrpE polypeptide and the structural gene of the somatostatin 14 peptide, in this order.An E.coli strain carrying a deletion within the chromosomal Trp operon has been transformed with the expression plasmid according to the invention and the cells grown under mild concentration of tryptophan or of its precursor, indole. TheseE.coli Trp cells, when grown in the presence of tryptophan, utilize part of the amino acid present in the medium leaving, after few hours, a Trp concentration sufficiently high to let the cells grow further, and low enough to maintain the Trp operator de repressed. An operable concentration range is of 3 to 8 Fg tryptophan per ml culture medium.The tryptophan, in the medium, can be replaced by its precursor, indole in a concentration range of about 2 to 6 g ml of culture medium. In this ease, the E. coli Trp cells convert the 5tp precursor to Itp, which is probably almost exclusively utilized for cell growth. The Trp concentration in the milieu renains sufficiently low to maintain the Trp operator de repressed.The heterologous polypeptide is continously expressed, up to a maximal level attained after 22 25 hours of growth.It is particularly surprising that the strategic approach on which this invention is based leads to such a good result, while the teaching of the prior art is that the Trp attenuator should not be present.On tbe contrary, the contemporaneous presence of the Trp leader and attenuator in the expression plasmid according to this invention permits the optical Trp concentration to be achieved without changing the culture medium during the complete growth of the cells. The net result is a continous process by which cells are grown while the heterologous polypeptide is expressed.The gene coding for 5514 has been prepared by chemical synthesis as described in Fig. IA.The accompanying drawings illustrate aspects of the preferred eibodiients of the invention.Figure 1.A.

The nucleotide sequences within arrows represent the various blocks, from S1 to S8, to be chemically synthetized.Figure l.B. Shown is the strategy to originate the 5514 coding gene from the various blocks. The oligonucleotide chemical synthesis was performed by the solid phase phosphotriester method using dinucleotides as building blocks and polystyrene as solid support. Most of the codons were selected to be better expressed in E. coli. The complete gene was obtained by ligation of the 5 1 to 5 8 oligonucleotides with T4 DNA ligase. The SS14 gene was also designated to be in correct reading frame with TrpE gene. Figure 2. Restriction map of pSP2 plasmid vector constructed as described in the text.

Aminoacid sequence of the hybrid TrpE 5514 polypeptideThe e description which follows illustrates the construction of pSP4 plasmid vector capable to express the hybrid polypeptide TrpE 5514. Construction of pSP2 plasmid.The pSP2 plasmid was constructed starting from pBR322 Bolivar et al, Gene, 2, 95, 1977 and A EDlOf Armstrong et al,Science, 196, 172, 1977 and Helsinki et al, in RecombinantMolecules, Tenth Miles International Symposium, Raven Press, 1977, pgg 151 165 , which was used as source of E.coli Trp operon DNA, that extends from promoter to TrpD structural gene.pBR322 and X EfliOf were degraded with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The EcoRI HindIII fragment carrying the Trp operon regulatory functions, the TrpE structural gene and the 5 end of the TrpD structural gene was ligated with the HindIII EcoRI larger fragment of pBR322 usingT4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was used to transformE.coli W3110 TxpR5 cells Nichols and Yanofsky, Methods in Euzymology, 101,155,1983 . The transformed cells were plated onto minimal medium plates lacking tryptophan. A Trp clone was used as source of plasmid recombinant DNA pSP2. Cells of this clone were grown and stored in rich medium ie NB, Difco containing 50 pg ml of ampicillin Ap . The restriction map of pSP2 is shown in Fig. 2.Construction of plasmid pSP2del.pSP2 plasmid DNA was degraded with Bgl II endonuclease and the larger fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated on itself with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was used used to transform W3110 A TrpE5 cells. Ap transformants were selected onto Nutrient Agar Difco containing 50 ,ug ml Ap. An RAp clone was used as source of pSP2del DNA whose restriction map is shown in Fig. 3. The removal of Bgl II fragment from theTrpE structural gene caused the expression of a partial TrpE polypeptide, with loss of its enzymatic activity. The pSP2del carrying W3110 TrpE5 cells must therefore be grown in the presence of tryptophan.The junction of Bgl II sites in pSP2del creates a new translation stop codon Nichols et al, J.Mol. Biol. 146, 45 54, 1981 .The TrpE coded by pSP2del A TrpE is composed of 342 aminoacids against the 520 in the complete TrpE protein coded by pSP2 plasmid see again Figure 3 . Construction of pSP3 plasmid. pSP2de1 DNA was cleaved with Bgl II restriction enzyme and then ligated with a Bgl Il Hindill converter tig.3 . The nucleotide sequence of the converter was such that the Bgl II sites were not regenerated. The ligation mixture was digested withRindIII, religated on itself and used to transform W3110 TrpE cells selecting for Ap . Some derivative recombinant plasmids appear to have removed the DNA between HindIII of the converter within the TrpE and HindIII that joins with pBR322 DNA see Fig.3 . The actual stop codon of the deleted TrpE gene is now a few codons downstream from the BindIII sites. The new TrpE protein is 328 aminoacids long.Analysis of TrpE and TrpE deleted derivative products.In our preliminary experiments the plasmid containing NG110TrpE5 cells were grown in LB Iuria Bertani medium which contains, per litre aqueous solution, 109 Bacto Tryptone, 5gBacto Yeast extract and 10 g NaCl, supplemented with 5 g ml ampicillin. In such conditions, the tryptophane is supplied by the medium, and therefore the Trp operon of both chromosome and plasmids is under repression.For derepression and expression the cells grown overnight in the LB medium about 2 OD, 590 nm are collected by centrifugation and diluted 20 times with SMM Spizizen MinimalMedium which contains per litre aqueous solution NH4 2S04 2 g.KH2PO4 6 g.K2HPO4 14 gNa Citrate.2B20 1 g.MgSO4 0.2 g.After autoclaving, the following is added. 10 g 40 glucose Tryptophane g mlThe concentration of Trp is enough to allow the growth of the cells and to maintain the Trp operon slightly de repressed.After 4 5 hours, the TrpE and deleted derivatives were analyzed by incorporation of radioactive amino acids.Cloning of SS 14 gene and its expression.pSP3 DNA was digested with HindIII and Banill restriction enzymes and the larger fragment was purified from agarose gel.This DNA was added to SS14 synthetic DNA and ligated with T4DNA ligase see Fig. 4 . The ligation mixture was used to transform W3110 TrpE5 cells and ApR transformants were selected on plates containing 50 g ml ampicillin. The recombinant plasmid containing SS14 gene was isolated and called pSP4. The nucleotide composition of the SS14 gene allows the production of a hybrid polypeptide containing the partial TrpE and somatostatin. The somatostatin peptide is preceded in the hybrid protein by a methionine which is cleavable by CNBr.The hybrid polypeptide expressed by pSP4 plasmid has the aminoacid sequence shown in Fig. 5 and is conventionally called TrpE 5Sl4. The first 323 aminoacids represent the first two thirds of the TrpE whereas the four aminoacids delimitated by hyphens are coded by the Bgl I5 HindIII converter see Fig. 3 .The converter aminoacids are followed by the 14 specific 5514 aminoacids.Production of Sonatostatin hybrid polypeptide. W3110 TrpE pSP4 cells were grown overnight in 300 ml of minimal medium to which glucose and tryptophan had been added as previously described. This culture 4.3xlO8cells ml was diluted in 10 liters of the same medium and the cells were allowed to grow under impeller agitation 300 rpm and with injection of 3 4 liters of air at I Atm per minute. After 22 25 hours of growth, the culture reached an OD 590nm of about 2. me cells were harvested and treated with CNBr as described byItakura et al Science, 198, 1056 1063, 1977 . The somatostatin released was tested by RIA. The average SS14 concentration observed was 300 liter of bacterial culture. An increase up to 400 p9 1 of final SS14 concentration was observed when theTrp in the medium was replaced by its precursor indole 3.5 pg ml . It is believed that the tryptophane derived from the conversion of indole by the bacteria is almost exclusively utilized for the bacterial growth itself. These conditions are therefore ideal to maintain the Trp operon de repressed.When the W31l0 TrpE5 pSP4 cells are grown in 10 liters of minimal medium, as previously described, containing 3.5 fig ml of indole, instead of Trp, under impeller agitation and insufflation of only 1 liter of air at 1 Atm per minute, the optical density reached after 22 25 hrs of growth is about 3 at 590nm. The reduction of the amount of air injected in the medium during the growth results in a 50 increase of bacterial mass without altering the relative concentration of the TrpE SS14 polypeptide. The concentration of SS14, detected byRIA after CNBr treatment, is about 600 ug liter of bacterial culture.The decrease of aereation seems therefore to favour the bacterial growth and, without altering the Trp operon regulatory system, seems to permit the recovery of a higher quantity of bacterial proteins, among which is the TrpE SS14, from the same volume of bacterial culture.Characterization of TrPE SS14 nolyreptide The SSl4 concentration detected by RIA was found to be lower than expected by the content in the hybrid polypeptide. It was possible that a particular structural conformation of theTrpE SS14 protein could be somehow responsible for the observed difference and therefore the properties of the protein were studied as follows. Protein extract of W3110 TrpE5 pSP4 cells was prepared and the Trp SS14 polypeptide was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and characterized bySepharose 4B chromatography.It was thus demonstrated that most of the TrpE SS14 is recovered from the bacteria as high molecular weight complexes that can be dissolved by reducing agents.Furthermore such aggregates are determined by both inter and intramolecular disulphide bonds. That such complexes are represented by the TrpE SS14 polypeptide is demonstrated by an immunoblotting experiment which shows iimnunoreactivity against SS14 antibodies.It is concluded that the lower 5514 concentration detected could be due to at least two reasons 1 Aspecific disuphide bonds can involve the SSl4 moiety of the TrpE SS14 polypeptide, impeding the liberation by CNBr of quantitative immunoreacting SS14 peptide the cyclic form . 2 TrpE SS14 aggregates, that could be present into the cells, are less sensitive to CNBr cleavage, leading as a consequence to a decrease in the amount of released cyclic SS14.
