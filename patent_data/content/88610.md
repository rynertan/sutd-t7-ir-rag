# Method for determination of percentage T cell content of lymphocyte.

## Abstract
A method for determining the percentage T cell content of lymphocyte, which comprises scanning a test specimen with a pickup device, discriminating a lymphocyte from other cells present in the specimen from the output level and regional in formation of the image signals transmitted from the pickup device, searching the data marginal to that of the cell discri minated as a lymphocyte to detect pixels corresponding to an image signal output level different from that corresponding to the lymphocytes or background, and identifying a T cell from other lymphocytes from the number of detected pixels.
