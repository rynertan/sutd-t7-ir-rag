## Description
The present invention relates to semiconductor memory devices with improved production yields. With the increase of memory capacity in the fabrication of recent semiconductor memory devices, the probability of the occurrence of error bit cells has also increased. Conventionally, semiconductor memory devices containing error bit cells have been discarded as defective devices. The discarding of the defective devices is very uneconomical, and also leads to an increase in the manufacturing cost. Some measures taken to solve this problem have succeeded in overcoming such uneconomical manufacturing methods. One of the successful measures employs a memory device with a redundancy function. Specifically, an auxiliary memory is used in addition to a main memory. When the main memory contains an error bit cell, a drive or select line, on which bit cells including the error bit are arranged, is selected and all of the bit cells including the error bit cell are replaced with the correct bit cells arrayed on a select line of the auxiliary memory. Fig. 1 shows in block form an example of such a semiconductor memory device. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 designates an address buffer whose output is applied to a main address decoder 2 and an auxiliary decoder 3. The output signal from the main address decoder 2 is applied to a main memory 4 to select one of the row lines in the main memory 4. Subsequently, data may be written, by a write signal, into specified memory bit cells connected to the selected row line. Similarly, the data may be read out therefrom by a read signal. The main address decoder 2 is controlled by an output signal from the auxiliary address decoder 3. The decoder output of the auxiliary address decoder 3 is applied to an auxiliary memory 5. The signal selects one row line of the auxiliary memory 5. Then, data may be written into memory cells connected to the row line by a write signal, and read out therefrom by a read signal. The auxiliary address decoder 3 is programmed so as to produce an output signal representing an address of a memory area containing an error bit cell in the main memory. A control signal generating circuit 6 generates a control signal for the auxiliary memory 5 when an error bit cell is found in the main memory 4. The control signal controls the auxiliary address decoder 3 so as to replace a specific number of bit cells including the error bit cell with the corresponding number of correct bit cells in the auxiliary memory 5. The specific number of bit cells are those arrayed on a select or drive line, having the error bit cell connected thereto, of the main or auxiliary memory. This circuit 6 is composed of a nonvolatile memory, so programmed that it drives the auxiliary address decoder 3 to access the auxiliary memory 5 when the error bit cell is found. When the main memory 4 does not contain an error bit cell, this control circuit 6 does not operate, and the main address decoder 2 accesses the main memory 4. On the other hand, when the main memory 4 has an error bit cell and is accessed, the control signal generating circuit 6 drives the auxiliary address decoder 3 to access the auxiliary memory 5, and at the same time to stop the operation of the main address decoder 2. In this way, the error bit cell in the main memory 4 is replaced with the correct bit cell of the auxiliary memory 5. Figs. 2A and 2B show practical circuit diagrams of two examples of the control signal generator 6. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2A, a fuse element F made of polysilicon or the like is inserted between a potential source VD and an output terminal Out. An enhancement type MOS transistor 7 is connected between the output terminal Out and a ground. A depletion type MOS transistor 8 is inserted between the output terminal Out and a ground. A programming signal P is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 7. The gate of the MOS transistor 8 is connected to a ground. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2B, the potential source VD and the output terminal Out have a programming enhancement type MOS transistor 7 and a depletion type MOS transistor 8, which are connected in parallel therebetween. A fuse element F is inserted between the output terminal Out and a ground. A programming signal P is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 7 and the gate of the MOS transistor 8 is connected to the output terminal Out. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2A, when the fuse element F is not burned out, a signal level at the output terminal Out is logical 1 since the resistance ratio of the MOS transistor 8 and the fuse element F is very large. However, when it is burned out, the output terminal Out is grounded through the MOS transistor 8 and becomes logical 0 . In order to burn out the fuse element F, a programming signal P of logical 1 is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 7. Then, the MOS transistor 7 turns on to allow a large current to flow into the fuse element F. The large current generates Joule heat which in turn burns out the fuse element F. When the fuse element F is burned out, the signal P returns to logical 0 to turn off the transistor 7. The signal at the output terminal Out, or the control signal from the control signal generator 6, is logical 1 , for example, and at this time the decoding operation of the auxiliary address decoder 3 stops. The decoding operation is performed only when the signal at the output terminal Out is logical 0 . In the circuit of Fig. 2B, when the fuse element F is not burned out, the signal level at the output terminal Out is kept at logical 0 , unlike the circuit of Fig. 2A, since the resistance ratio of the MOS transistor 8 and the fuse element F is very large. On the other hand, when it is burned out, the output terminal Out is connected to the power source VD terminal through the MOS transistor 8, and is logical 1 . In order to burn the fuse element F, a programming signal P of logical 1 is applied to the gate of the MOS transistor 7. At this time, the transistor 7 is turned on, as in the above case, to allow a large current to flow into the fuse element F. In this circuit, when the signal at the output terminal Out, or a control signal, is logical 0 , the decoding operation of the auxiliary address decoder 3 is stopped. When it is logical 1 , the decoding operation is executed. Fig. 3 shows a circuit diagram of an example of the auxiliary address decoder 3 when the control signal generator 6 is not used. The auxiliary address decoder 3 is comprised of a depletion type MOS transistor 9 for a load, a plurality of enhancement type MOS transistors 10 for driving the auxiliary memory whose gates are coupled with an address signal or data A₀, The auxiliary address decoder 3 is so programmed that when the memory cell in the main memory 4 which is specified by an address signal A₀ A₁ ...

Further, prior art document IEEE International Solid State Circuits conference, Vol. 25, February 1982, pages 256, 257 and 332 proposes a redundancy technique using spare on chip programming to improve the manufacturing yield of a RAM. This is achieved by applying laser pulses to an intrinsic polysilicon film having an N It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device which permits switching of the main memory over to the auxiliary memory if the main memory has an error bit cell by a simple operation, and thus permits improvement of the yield.

Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of the semiconductor memory device according to the invention. Referring to the Figure, reference numeral 11 designates a decoder which decodes an address input signal a₀, The operation of the control circuit C₁ will now be described. The control circuit C₁ has two different output levels depending upon whether the fuse element P₁ remains intact or is burned out. The transistor 12₁ is controlled according to the state of the fuse element P₁. It is now assumed that the fuse element P₁ connected between the potential source VD and transistor 14₁ remains intact. In this case, the junction between the fuse element P₁ and transistor 14₁ is at the 1 level. Thus, the transistor 16₁ is on , so that the inverter consisting of the transistors 15₁ and 16₁, i.e., the control circuit C₁, provides a 0 level output to hold the transistor 12₁ off . When the fuse element P₁ is burned out, for instance by irradiation thereof with a laser beam, the gate level of the transistor 16₁ becomes 0 to turn off the transistor 16₁ Thus, the inverter, i.e., the control circuit C₁, provides a 1 level output to turn on the transistor 12₁. As is shown, the output of the control circuit C₁ is at either one of the two levels depending upon whether the fuse element P₁ connected between the potential source VD and transistor 14₁ remains intact or it is burned out, and the transistor 12₁ is on off controlled according to the state of the fuse element P₁. The operation of the memory device shown in Fig. 14 will now be described. If the main memory 18 is free from any error bit cell, the fuse elements P₁, P₂, ... in the respective control circuits C₁, C₂, ... connected between the potential source VD and the respective transistors 14₁, 14₂, ... are not burned out but remain intact. The transistors 12₁, 12₂, ... are thus off , so that the outputs of the decoder are applied through the respective buffer circuits A₁, A₂, ... to the main memory 18. The main memory 18 is thus selected and rendered operative. In this case, since the transistors 12₁, 12₂, ... are off , the junction B₁ between each of the transistors 12₁, 12₂, ... and transistor 13 is held at the reference potential VS i.e., at the 0 level through the transistor 13. The output level of the buffer circuits AR₁ and AR₂ is thus 0 i.e., level VS , and the auxiliary memory 19, which is not selected, remains inoperative. Now, a case will be considered in which there is an error bit cell connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18. In this case, the fuse element P₁ in the circuit C₁ is burned out, for instance by irradiating it with a laser beam. In this state, the gate of the transistor 16₁ is held at the 0 level through the transistor 14₁, thus keeping the transistor 16₁ off . The gate of the transistor 12₁ is thus held at the source potential level VD e.g., 5 volts through the transistor 15₁, thus keeping the transistor 12₁ on . The decoder output line R₁ is thus connected to the point B₁. When a decoder output of 1 appears, the point B₁ is also set to the 1 level by the transistor 12₁. The buffer circuits AR₁ and AR₂ thus both provide a 1 level output. The auxiliary memory 19 is thus selected and rendered operative. The resistance of the transistor is set to a sufficiently high value to allow the point B₁ to go to the 1 level. As soon as the auxiliary memory 19 is selected, the transistors 17₁, 17₂, ... are turned on by the 1 level output of the buffer circuit A As has been shown, in the above embodiment of Fig. 4, the auxiliary memory 19 can be substituted for the main memory 18 by burning out a single fuse element such as the fuse element P₁ in the control circuit C₁, for instance by irradiating the same with a laser beam. While the above embodiment of Fig. 4 has a single auxiliary memory, similar effects of the invention can also be obtained in cases where there are two auxiliary memories. In this case, the transistors 12₁, 12₂, ..., transistor 13, circuits C₁, C₂, ..., buffer circuits AR₁ and AR₂ and transistors 17₁, 17₂, ... may be provided in duplicate. Fig. 5 shows a different example of the control circuit C₁. While in the circuit C₁ shown in Fig. 4 the fuse element P₁ is adapted to be burned out with, for example, a laser beam, in the circuit of Fig. 5 a high resistance polysilicon element 21 is laser annealed, i.e., rendered in the low resistance state by irradiation with a laser beam, thereby causing a change of the output level of the circuit to 1 . The high resistance polysilicon element 21 has one terminal connected through a depletion type MOS transistor 22 to the potential source VD, and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS. The gate of the transistor 22 is connected to the junction between the transistor 22 and high resistance polysilicon element 21. The gate of the transistor 22 is also connected to the gate of the transistor 16₁. The circuit further includes an inverter, which consists of a depletion type MOS transistor 15₁ and an enhancement type MOS transistor 16₁ and is connected between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The output terminal of the inverter, i.e., the junction between the MOS transistor 15₁ and 16₁, is connected to the gate of the transistor 12₁. With this construction, the high resistance polysilicon element 21 remains intact unless the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 include an error bit cell. In this case, the junction between the transistor 22 and the high resistance polysilicon element 21 is held at the 1 level. Thus, the transistor 16₁ is on to hold the gate of the transistor 12₁ at the 0 level, and hence, hold the transistor 12₁ on . The decoder output line R₁ is thus held apart from the point B₁. If the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ include an error bit cell, the high resistance polysilicon 21 is changed to the low resistance state by laser annealing, for instance. In this state, the gate of the transistor 16₁ is held at the 0 level to hold the transistor 16₁ off . The gate potential on the transistor 12₁ is thus held at the 1 level through the transistor 15₁, so that the transistor 12₁ is off . The auxiliary memory 19 is thus selected in this case in the manner as described before in connection with Fig. 4. Fig. 6 shows a modification of the circuit of Fig. 5 for reducing power consumption. In this circuit, the decoder output on the output line R₁ is fed to the gate of transistors 31 and 32 so that the circuit is only operated when the decoder output level becomes 1 . More specifically, in the circuit of Fig. 6 the transistor 31 is connected between the potential source VD and transistor 15₁ while the transistor 32 is connected between the high resistance polysilicon element 21 and reference potential source VS. These transistors have their gates connected to the output line R₁. This circuit is only rendered operative when the transistors 31 and 32 are turned on with a change of the decoder output appearing on the output line R₁ to the 1 level. When the decoder output is 0 , the transistors 31 and 32 are off so that the circuit is inoperative. In other words, unless the output line R₁ is selected, no current flows through the circuit. Thus, power consumption can be reduced. Fig. 7 shows a further modification of the control circuit C₁ in the memory device of Fig. 4. This circuit, like the circuit of Fig. 6, includes two additional MOS transistors 41 and 42. The decoder output is applied to the gates of these transistors 41 and 42, and thereby the power consumption in the control circuit C₁ can be reduced. To be more specific, the additional MOS transistor 41 is connected between the transistor 14₁ and reference potential source VS, while the additional MOS transistor 42 is connected between the transistor 15₁ and potential source VD, with the gates of these MOS transistors 41 and 42 being connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. With this construction, the circuit is rendered operative only when the transistors 41 and 42 are turned on with a change of the output of the decoder 11 to the 1 level and is inoperative otherwise, i.e., when the decoder output is 0 . In other words, unless the output line R₁ is selected, no current flows through the circuit, so that power consumption can be reduced. Fig. 8 shows a further modification of the control circuit C₁ shown in Fig. 4. In this instance, a polysilicon fuse element P₁ is adapted to be burned out by Joule heat from a generated current. This circuit has an advantage over the circuit shown in Fig. 4, in which the fuse element P₁ is burned out by irradiation with a laser beam, in that a semiconductor memory device which uses this circuit can be sealed in a casing. This circuit uses two MOS transistors 51 and 52 in addition to the control circuit C₁ in the memory device of Fig. 4. These MOS transistors are connected in series between the polysilicon fuse element P₁ and reference potential source VS. The gate of the transistor 51 is connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. A signal P for controlling the MOS transistor 52 is applied to the gate thereof. To burn out the polysilicon fuse element P₁ in the above construction, the address input signal to the decoder 11 is set to that locus which represents the address of the error bit cell. As a result, a 1 output is provided from the decoder to the output line R₁ to turn on the transistor 51. Subsequently, the signal P is set to 1 to turn on the transistor 52. Current is thus caused to flow through the fuse element P₁ and transistors 51 and 52. The fuse element P₁ is then burned out by Joule heat generated at this time. Fig. 9 shows a still further modification of the control circuit C₁, the fuse element P₁ of which is again adapted to be burned out by a generated current. In this instance, MOS transistors 61 to 67 are provided in addition to the circuit of Fig. 7. Further, like the circuit of Fig. 7 transistors 41 and 42 are provided for reducing power consumption. The transistor 41 in this circuit, unlike the circuit of Fig. 7, is provided between the fuse element P₁ and transistor 14₁. This, however, is a mere structural change, and there is no change in operation at all. The portion of the circuit that can serve to burn out the fuse will now be described in detail. The MOS transistor 61, which is a depletion type, and the MOS transistor 62, which is an enhancement type, form an inverter I₆₁ connected between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The MOS transistor 63 is connected between the transistor 62 and reference potential source VD. The input terminal of the inverter I₆₁ consisting of the transistors 61 and 62, i.e., the gate of the transistor 62, is connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. A control signal P for on off controlling the transistor 63 is applied to the gate thereof. The MOS transistor 65, which is a depletion type, and MOS transistor 64, which is an enhancement type, form another inverter I₆₅ connected between a high potential source VP and reference potential source VS. The output terminal of the preceding stage inverter I₆₁ consisting of the transistors 61 and 62, i.e., the junction between the transistors 61 and 62, is connected to the input terminal of the inverter I₆₅, i.e., the gate of the transistor 64. The MOS transistor 66 is connected between the input terminal of the inverter I₆₅ consisting of the transistors 64 and 65, i.e., the junction between the transistors 64 and 65, and the reference potential source VS. A complementary control signal To burn out the fuse P₁, the address input signal to the decoder 11 is set to select the output line R₁ like the example of Fig. 8. When the output line R₁ is selected by a 1 input, the transistor 62 is turned on. In this state, the signal P is set to 1 to turn on the transistor 63. The potential on the gate of the transistor 64 is thus changed to the 0 level to turn off the transistor 64. At this time, the transistor 66 remains off since the signal The high potential source VP is used only when burning out the fuse, and after the burn out operation the gate of the transistor 67 is brought to the 0 level to turn off the transistor 67. With the fuse element P₁ burned out, the gate of the transistor 16₁ is now at the reference potential to hold the transistor 16₁ off . In this state, when the output line R₁ of the decoder 11 is selected, the output of the inverter consisting of the transistors 15₁ and 16₁ goes to the 1 level to turn on the transistor 12₁. The auxiliary memory 19 is thus substituted for the main memory 18. Fig. 10 shows an example of the buffer circuit A₁ provided between the output line R₁ and drive line W₁ in the memory device of Fig. 4. The circuit has MOS transistors 71 to 78. The transistors 71 and 72, which are depletion type and enhancement type, respectively, are connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS to form an inverter I₇₁. The input terminal of the inverter I₇₁, i.e., the gate of the transistor 72, is connected to the junction B₁ between the transistors 12₁ and 13 in the memory device of Fig. 4. The transistor 73, which is a depletion type, and transistors 74 and 75, which are enhancement type, are connected in series in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The transistors 73 and 74 form an inverter I₇₃. The transistors 76 to 78 are connected in series in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The output terminal of the inverter consisting of the transistors 71 and 72, i.e., the junction between the transistors 71 and 72, is connected to the gate of each of the transistors 75 and 76. The gates of the transistors 74 and 77 are connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. The output terminal of the inverter I₇₃ consisting of the transistors 73 and 74, i.e., the junction between the transistors 73 and 74, is connected to the gate of the transistor 78. The junction between the transistors 77 and 78 is connected to the drive line W₁ connected to the main memory 18. The operation of the buffer circuit having the above construction will now be described. If the main memory 18 has no error bit cell, the junction B₁ is at the 0 level. In this state, the inverter I₇₁ consisting of the transistors 71 and 72 provides a 1 output, that is, a 1 input is applied to the gate of each of the transistors 75 and 76 to hold these transistors 75 and 76 on . The buffer circuit thus provides a signal at a level corresponding to the level of the output line R₁ to the drive line W₁. If the level of the output line R₁ becomes 1 , the transistors 74 and 73 are turned on. With the transistor 74 turned on, the output of the inverter I₇₃ consisting of the transistors 73 and 74 becomes 0 to turn off the transistor 78. A 1 level signal is thus provided from the junction between the transistors 77 and 78. If the level of the output line R₁ becomes 0 , the transistors 74 and 77 are both turned off. With the transistor 74 turned off, the output of the inverter I₇₃ consisting of the transistors 73 and 74 becomes 1 to turn on the transistor 78. A 0 level signal is thus provided from the junction between the transistors 77 and 78. If the main memory 18 has an error bit cell connected to the drive line W₁ so that the auxiliary memory 19 is selected, the level at the junction B₁ is 1 . In this state, the inverter I₇₁ consisting of the transistors 71 and 72 provides a 0 level output. That is, a 0 level input is applied to the gate of each of the transistors 75 and 76 to keep the transistors 75 and 76 off . In this condition, the buffer circuit A₁ thus provides a 0 level output irrespective of the level of the output line R₁. More particularly, with the transistors 75 and 76 turned off, the buffer circuit A₁ provides a 0 level signal at all times and is not influenced by whether the level of the output line R₁ is 0 or 1 . Where the buffer circuit A₁ of Fig. 10 described above is used, the transistor 17₁ in the memory device of Fig. 4 is unnecessary. It is to be appreciated that in the embodiment of Figs. 4 through 10 described above a transistor circuit for selecting the auxiliary memory is provided between the decoder and auxiliary memory and on off controlled depending upon whether a single fuse element assembled in the control circuit is burned out or not or whether a high resistance polysilicon element assembled in the control circuit is rendered in a low resistance state or not. Thus, the operation of selecting the auxiliary memory can be readily accomplished with high reliability. Fig. 11 shows a different embodiment of the memory device according to the invention. In this embodiment, like parts to those in the preceding embodiment of Fig. 4 are designated by like reference numerals and symbols. In this embodiment, control circuit C₁ includes a high resistance polysilicon element R In the control circuit C₁, the junction between the high resistance polysilicon element R It is now assumed that the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ do not include any error bit cell. In this case, the high resistance polysilicon element R When the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ include an error bit cell, the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 12 shows a modification of the control circuit C₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. In this instance, a polysilicon fuse element P is used in lieu of the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 13 shows an example of the inverter I₁₁₅ in the memory device of Fig. 11. This circuit includes an inverter I₁₁₇, which consists of a depletion type MOS transistor 117 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 118, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and a reference potential source VS, and two series MOS transistors 119 and 120 connected in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The input terminal of the inverter I₁₁₇, i.e., the gate of the transistor 118, and the gate of the transistor 120 connected to the reference potential source VS are both connected to the junction B₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. The gate of the transistor 119 connected to the potential source VD is connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₁₁₇, i.e., the junction between the transistors 117 and 118. The junction between the transistors 119 and 120 is connected to the auxiliary memory 19. With the above construction, so long as the level of the junction B₁ is 1 , the level of the gate potential on the transistors 118 and 120 is 1 so that these transistors 118 and 120 are on . With the transistor 118 in the on state, the output level of the inverter I₁₁₇ is 0 , that is, the gate level of the transistor 119 is 0 so that the transistor 119 is 0 . With the transistors 119 and 120 respectively in the off and on state, the transistor 120 is on . The output level of the circuit is thus 0 so that the auxiliary memory 19 is not selected. When the level of the junction B₁ is changed to 0 , the gate level on the transistors 118 and 120 is changed to 0 to turn off the transistors 118 and 120. With the transistor 118 turned off, the output level of the inverter I₁₁₇ becomes 1 . The gate level on the transistor 119 thus becomes 1 to turn on the transistor 119. Now, with the transistors 119 and 120 respectively on and off , the circuit output level is changed to 1 to select the auxiliary memory 19. This example of a circuit consisting of the transistors 119 and 120 has a buffer function in addition to the inverter function provided by the inverter I₁₁₇ consisting of the transistors 117 and 118. Fig. 14 shows an example of the buffer circuit A₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. This circuit reduces power consumption in addition to its buffer function. It includes an inverter I₁₂₁, which consists of a depletion type MOS transistor 121, and an enhancement type MOS transistor 122, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It also includes transistors 123 to 125 connected in series in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes a MOS transistor 126 having one terminal connected through the inverter I₁₂₁ to the potential source VD and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS. The gate of the transistor 122 in the inverter I₁₂₁ and the gate of the second transistor 124 in the series MOS transistor circuit are connected to the output line R₁. The gate of the third transistor 125 in the series MOS transistor circuit is connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₁₂₁, i.e., the junction between the transistors 121 and 122. The transistors 126 and 123 are provided for reducing power consumption, and their gate is connected to the junction B₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. With the above construction, when the auxiliary memory 19 is not selected, i.e., when the potential level on the junction B₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11 is 1 , the gate potential level on the transistors 123 and 126 is 1 so that these transistors 123 and 126 are on . In this state, the output signal of the buffer circuit A₁ is thus at a level corresponding to the input signal level. To be more specific, when the output line R₁ is selected so that its level becomes 1 , the gate potential level on the transistor 122 in the inverter I₁₂₁ and the second transistor 124 in the series MOS transistor circuit becomes 1 to turn on the transistors 122 and 124. With the transistor 122 turned on, the level of the output signal of the inverter I₁₂₁ becomes 0 to turn off the third transistor 125 in the series MOS transistor circuit. Thus, the buffer circuit A₁ provides an output signal at the same level as the input signal level. When the output line R₁ is not selected, i.e., when the level thereof is changed to 0 , the gate level of the transistors 122 and 124 becomes 0 to turn off these transistors. With the transistor 122 turned off, the output level of the inverter I₁₂₁ becomes 1 to turn on the transistor 125. The buffer circuit A₁ thus provides an output signal at the same level as the input signal level of 0 . As has been shown, the output level of the buffer circuit A₁ corresponds to the input level while the transistors 123 and 126 are on . When the auxiliary memory 19 is in the selected state, i.e., when the potential level at the junction B₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11 is 0 , the gate potential level on the transistors 123 and 126 is 0 so that these transistors 123 and 126 are off . In this case, the output level of the buffer circuit A₁ is 0 irrespective of the input level. The inverter I₁₂₁ provides a 1 level output irrespective of the level of the output line R₁ so that the transistor 125 is held on . Therefore, the junction between the transistors 124 and 125 is kept apart from the potential VD irrespective of the level of the output line R₁. The output level of the buffer circuit A₁ is thus held at 0 irrespective of the input level. It is to be appreciated that the buffer circuit A₁ described above functions to inhibit the selection of the level of the drive line of the main memory 18, while the transistors 123 and 126 function to reduce power consumption while the main memory 18 is in the nonselected state. Where this buffer circuit is used, the transistors 17₁, 17₂, ... in the memory device of Fig. 11 are unnecessary. Fig. 15 shows a modification of the circuit consisting of the control circuit C₁ and transistors 112₁ and 113₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. In this example, a high resistance polysilicon element C₁ and a depletion type MOS transistor 127 having one terminal connected to the potential source VD and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS are used in lieu of the control circuit C₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. The circuit further includes an inverter I₁₂₈, which consists of a depletion type MOS transistor 128 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 124, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS, and another inverter I₁₂₀, which consists of a depletion type MOS transistor 130 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 131, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes a MOS transistor 132, which has one terminal connected to the reference potential source VS, the other terminal connected to the junction B₁ shown in Fig. 11 and the gate connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₁₂₈, i.e., the junction between the transistors 128 and 129. It further includes a MOS transistor 132, which has one terminal connected to the reference potential source VS, the other terminal connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₁₂₈ and the gate connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₁₃₀, i.e., the junction between the transistors 130 and 131. The circuit consisting of the inverters I₁₂₈ and I₁₃₀ and MOS transistors 132 and 133 has the same function as the circuit consisting of the transistors 112 and 113 in the memory device of Fig. 11. The gate of the inverter I₁₂₈ is connected to the output terminal of the control circuit C₁. The gate of the transistor 131 of the inverter I₁₃₀ is connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11 of the memory device of Fig. 11. With the above construction, if the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 do not include any error bit cell, the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 16 shows a further modification of the circuit consisting of the control circuit C₁ and transistors 112₁ and 113₁ in the memory device of Fig. 11. In this example, a high resistance polysilicon element R With the above construction, if the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 do not include any error bit cell, the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 17 shows a further embodiment of the memory device according to the invention. In this embodiment, like parts to those in the preceding embodiments of Figs. 4 and 11 are designated by like reference numerals and symbols. In this embodiment, a buffer circuit A3 is used in lieu of the circuit consisting of the transistors 112₁ and 113₁ in the preceding embodiment of Fig. 11, while the same circuit as the control circuit C₁ in the embodiment of Fig. 11 is used. The buffer circuit A3 has its input terminals connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11 and the output terminal of the control circuit C₁ respectively. Its output terminal is connected through buffer circuit A₄ to auxiliary memory 19, and also connected to the gate of each of transistors 17₁, 17₂, ... The junction between the output of the buffer circuit A₃ and the input terminal of each of the buffer circuits A₄ and A₅ is indicated at B₂. In this embodiment, like the embodiment of Fig. 11, if the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 do not include any error bit cell, the high resistance polysilicon element R If there is an error bit cell connected to the drive line W₁, in which case the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 18 shows an example of the buffer circuit A₃. This circuit includes an inverter I₂₁₁ consisting of a depletion type MOS transistor 211 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 212, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS, and MOS transistors 213 to 216 connected in series in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS from the side of the potential source VD. The gate of the transistor 212 in the inverter I₂₁₁ and the gate of the second transistor 214 in the series MOS transistor circuit are connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. The gate of each of the transistors 213 and 215 in the series MOS transistor circuit is connected to the output terminal E of the control circuit C₁. The output terminal of the inverter I₂₁₁, i.e., the junction between the transistors 211 and 212, is connected to the gate of the fourth transistor 216 in the series MOS transistor circuit. The junction between the transistors 124 and 125 of the series MOS transistor circuit constitutes the output terminal of the buffer circuit A₃. With the above construction, if the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 do not include any error bit cell, the output level of the control circuit C₁ is 0 , and the gate level on the first and third transistors 213 and 215 of the series MOS transistor circuit is 0 to hold these transistors 213 and 215 off . In this state, the level of the junction B₂ is not affected at all by the level of the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. On the other hand, if the memory bit cells include an error bit cell, the output level of the control circuit C₁ is 1 . In this case, the gate level on the first and third transistors 213 and 215 in the series MOS transistor circuit is 1 to hold these transistors 213 and 215 on . In this case, the level of the output line R₁ of the decoder 11 is changed according to the level of the junction B₂. More specifically, when the output line R₁ is selected so that its level becomes 1 , the transistor 212 in the inverter I₂₁₁ and the second transistor 214 of the series MOS transistor circuit are turned on. With the transistor 212 turned on, the output level of the inverter I₂₁₁ becomes 0 to turn off the transistor 216. The output level of the buffer circuit A₃ thus becomes 1 . A 1 level output is thus provided from the junction B₂. This 1 level signal is fed through the buffer device A₄ in the memory device of Fig. 17 to the auxiliary memory 19. The auxiliary memory 19 is thus selected and rendered operative. The 1 level signal from the buffer circuit A₃ is also fed trough the buffer circuit A₅ to the gate of each of the transistors 17₁, 17₂, ... to turn on these transistors. Fig. 19 shows an example of the buffer circuit A₂ in the memory device of Fig. 17. This circuit includes an inverter I₂₁₇ consisting of a depletion type MOS transistor 217 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 218, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It also includes another inverter I₂₁₉ consisting of a depletion type MOS transistor 219 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 220, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes a MOS transistor 221 connected between the inverter I₂₁₉ and reference potential source VS and transistors 222 to 224 connected in series in the given order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The gate of the transistor 218 in the inverter I₂₁₇ is connected to the junction B₂ in the memory device of Fig. 17. The gate of the transistor 220 in the inverter I₂₁₉ and the gate of the second transistor 223 in the series MOS transistor are connected to the output line R₁ of the decoder 11. The gate of the transistor 221 and the gate of the first transistor 222 in the series MOS transistor circuit are connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₂₁₇, i.e., the junction between the transistors 217 and 218. The gate of the third transistor 224 in the series MOS transistor circuit is connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₂₁₉, i.e., the junction between the transistors 219 and 220. The junction between the transistors 223 and 224 constitutes the output terminal of the buffer circuit A₂. With the above construction, if the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ of the main memory 18 do not include any error bit cell, the selection of the output line R₁ of the decoder 11 to the 1 level sets the junction B₂ to the 0 level. As a result, the transistor 218 of the inverter I₂₁₇ is turned off to change the output level of the inverter I₂₁₇ to 1 . The gate potential level on the transistors 221 and 222 thus becomes 1 to turn on these transistors 221 and 222. Meanwhile, with the selection of the output line R₁ to the 1 level, the transistors 220 and 223 are turned on. The buffer circuit A₂ thus provides an output at the same level as the input level, i.e., 1 . The main memory 18 is thus selected and rendered operative. If the memory bit cells connected to the drive line W₁ include an error bit cell, with the selection of the output line R₁ to the 1 level the level of the junction B₂ becomes 1 . As a result, the transistor 218 in the inverter I₂₁₇ is turned on. The output level of the inverter I₂₁₇ thus becomes 0 to turn off the transistors 221 and 222. In this case, the buffer circuit A₂ provides a 0 level output so that the main memory 19 is not selected and rendered inoperative. In this example, the transistors 221 and 222 are used in lieu of the transistor 17₁ in the embodiment of Fig. 17. Where this buffer circuit is used, the transistor 17₁ in the memory device of Fig. 17 is thus unnecessary. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 11 through 16 and Figs. 17 through 19, a transistor circuit is provided between the decoder and auxiliary memory and is on off controlled according to whether or not a single polysilicon fuse element incorporated in its on off control circuit is burned out or whether a single high resistance polysilicon element in the on off control circuit is changed to the low resistance state. The auxiliary memory can thus be readily and reliably selected and rendered operative. Figs. 20A and 20B show a further embodiment of the memory device according to the invention.

This circuit includes a depletion type MOS transistor 431 having one terminal connected to potential source VD, MOS transistors 432 and 433 each having one terminal connected through the transistor 431 to the potential source VD and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS, a depletion type MOS transistor 435 having one terminal connected to the potential source VD, and MOS transistors 434 and 436 each having one terminal connected through the transistor 435 to the potential source VD and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS. It further includes a depletion type MOS transistor 437 having one terminal connected to the potential source VD and MOS transistors 438 and 439 each having one terminal connected through the transistor 437 to the potential source VD and the other terminal connected to the reference potential source VS. It further includes an inverter I₄₄₀ consisting of a depletion type MOS transistor 440 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 441, these transistors being connected between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes two MOS transistors 442 and 443 connected in series in the given order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS from the side of the potential source VD. The transistors 431, 432 and 433 constitute a NOR gate. The transistors 434, 435 and 436 constitute another NOR gate. The transistors 437, 438 and 439 constitute a still another NOR gate. The gate of the transistor 432 is connected to the signal line X₁ in the memory device of Fig. 20. The gate of the transistor 433 is connected to the signal line Y₁. The gate of the transistor 438 is connected to the signal line X₂. The gate of the transistor 439 is connected to the signal line Y₂. The gate of the transistor is connected to the junction between the transistors 432 and 433. The gate of the transistor 436 is connected to the junction between the transistors 438 and 439. The gate of the transistor 441 is connected to the junction between the transistors 435 and each of the transistors 434 and 436. The gate of the transistor 442 is connected to the output terminal of the inverter I₄₄₀, i.e., the junction between the transistors 440 and 441. The junction between the transistors 442 and 443 constitutes the output terminal of this auxiliary memory selecting circuit 314, and is connected to the drive line R With the above construction, if the address input signals do not designate the address of an error memory cell, the level of one or both of the signal lines X₁ and Y₁ is 1 . Also, the level of one or both of the signal lines X₂ and Y₂ is 1 . The gate of the transistors 434 and 436 is thus at the 0 level so that these transistors are off . The gate of the transistors 441 and 443, i.e., the node N, is thus at the 1 level so that these transistors are on . With the transistor 441 on , the gate level of the transistor 442 is 0 to render the transistor 442 turned off. With the transistor 442 off and the transistor 443 on , the output of the auxiliary memory selecting circuit 314 is at the 0 level to keep the drive line R When the error bit cell is designated by the address input signals, the level of both the signal lines X₁ and Y₁ becomes 0 . As a result, the gate level on the transistor 434 becomes 1 to turn on this transistor. The level on the node N thus becomes 0 to turn off the transistors 441 and 443. With the transistor 441 turned off, the gate level of the transistor 442 becomes 1 to turn on the transistor 442. With the transistor 442 turned on and the transistor 443 turned off, the output level of the auxiliary memory selecting circuit 314 becomes 1 . The level of the drive line R Fig. 22 shows a modification of the circuit consisting of the high resistance polysilicon element R Fig. 23 shows an example of the auxiliary memory selecting circuit 114 in the memory device of Figs. 20A and 20B incorporating the construction of Fig. 22. The circuit includes a NAND gate I₄₆₁ having a depletion type MOS transistor 461 and enhancement type MOS transistors 462 and 463, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It also includes another NAND gate I₄₆₄ having a depletion type MOS transistor 464 and enhancement type MOS transistors 465 and 466, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes a third NAND gate I₄₆₇ having a depletion type MOS transistor 467 and enhancement type MOS transistors 468 and 469, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes an inverter I₄₇₀ having a depletion type MOS transistor 470 and an enhancement type MOS transistor 471, these transistors being connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. It further includes two MOS transistors 472 and 473 connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The transistors 462, 463, 465 and 466 have their gates respectively connected to signal lines Fig. 24 shows an example of the buffer circuit A₂₁ in the memory device of Fig. 20. The circuit includes a NAND gate I₄₈₁ having a depletion type MOS transistor 481 and enhancement type MOS transistors 482 and 483, these transistors being connected in series in the mentioned order between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS from the side of the potential source VD. It also includes MOS transistors 484 to 486 connected in series between the potential source VD and reference potential source VS. The gate of each of the transistors 482 and 485 is connected to the output line R₂₁. The output terminal of the NAND gate I₄₈₁, i.e., the junction between the transistors 481 and 482, is connected to the gate of the transistor 486. The gate of each of the transistors 483 and 484 is connected to the node N in the circuit of Fig. 21. The junction between the transistors 485 and 486 constitutes the output terminal of this buffer circuit A₂₁, and is connected to the drive line R With the above construction, when address input signals designating an error bit cell appear, the level on the node N becomes 0 to turn off the transistors 483 and 484. With the transistor 483 turned off, the output level of the NAND gate I₄₈₁ becomes 1 to turn on the transistor 486. The output level of the buffer circuit A₂₁ thus becomes 0 . The level of the drive line R Figs. 25, 26 and 27 show circuits which use a polysilicon fuse element which can be used in place of the high resistance polysilicon element R In the circuit of Fig. 25, a fuse element is connected at one terminal to the reference potential source VS and at the other terminal through a depletion type MOS transistor 492 to the potential source VD. The junction between the fuse element 491 and transistor 492 constitutes the output terminal of this circuit. If the memory bit cells connected to the column line C₁ of the main memory 18 include an error bit cell, the fuse element 491 is burned out by irradiation thereof with a laser beam, for instance. With the fuse element 491 burned out, a 1 level output is provided. In the circuit of Fig. 26, a fuse element 495 is connected at one terminal through a depletion type MOS transistor 494 to the potential source VD. The other terminal of the fuse element 495 is connected to the reference potential source VS through an enhancement type MOS transistor 493 1 and a depletion type MOS transistor 493 2 parallel connected each other. A pulse P is applied to the gate of the transistor 494. The gate of the transistor 493 1 is connected to the output line R₁₁ of the decoder 311. The gate of the transistor 493 2 is connected to the potential source VD. If the bit memory cells connected to the column line C₁ include an error bit cell, the fuse element 495 is burned out. It is burned out when address input signals designating the address of the error bit cell are generated. To be more specific, when these address input signals appear, the transistor 493 is turned on. At this time, the pulse signal P₁ is set to 1 , thus turning on the transistor 494. A large current is thus caused to flow through the fuse element 495 and it is burned out by Joule heat at this time. With the fuse element 495 burned out, a 1 level signal is provided. While the fuse element 495 not burn out, a 0 level signal is provided through the transistor 493 2. In the circuit of Fig. 27, a polysilicon fuse element 497 is connected at one terminal to a high potential source VP and at the other terminal through a depletion type MOS transistor 496 to the reference potential source VS. The junction between the fuse element 497 and transistor 496 is connected through an inverter 498 to the output terminal. The gate of the transistor 496 is connected to the output line R₁₁ of the decoder 311. If the memory bit cells connected to the column line C₁ of the main memory 18 include an error bit cell, the fuse element 497 is burned out. This is done when address input signals designating the error bit cell are input. To be more specific, when these address input signals are input, the transistor 496 is turned on. Then, the voltage of the potential source VP is made about 15 V to cause a large current to flow through the fuse element 497, whereby the fuse element 497 is burned out. When the fuse element 497 is burned out, the voltage of the potential source VP is returned to the potential VD and the input level applied to the inverter 498 is 0 so that the output level thereof is 0 . In the embodiment of Figs. 20A and 20B through 27 described above, a transistor circuit is provided between the column decoder and auxiliary memory and is on off controlled depending upon whether a single polysilicon fuse element incorporated in the control circuit is burned out or not or a single high resistance polysilicon element in the control circuit is changed to the low resistance state or not. In addition, a similar transistor circuit is provided between the row decoder and auxiliary memory and is similarly on off controlled. Thus, the auxiliary memory can be readily and reliably selected and rendered operative. As has been described in the foregoing, according to the invention it is possible to provide a semiconductor memory device with which the auxiliary memory can be easily and simply accessed, and which improves both the reliability and the probability of access to the auxiliary memory.
