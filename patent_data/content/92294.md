# Partition for a cargo carrier for bulk freight.

## Abstract
A partition for a cargo carrier 1 for bulk freight. The cargo carrier is provided with an unloading opening 3 closable by a door 4 or board at the location of a partition to be positioned at the inner side thereof. The partition in cludes a number of profiles 8 to be positioned horizontally across the unloading opening 3 in superposed relation into two supports 4 . The supports 4 are provided at the location of the walls of the cargo carrier and extend perpen dicular to the plane of the unloading opening 3 . Each of the supports 4 includes a plate 4 the height of which corres ponds substantially with the height of the partition. The plate 4 is placed against the inner wall of the cargo carrier and has parallel to the plane of the wall of the cargo carrier a dimension such that the bulk freight urges the plate 4 against said wall by a sufficient force as to hold the plate 4 by friction. The plate 4 is provided at the edge facing to the door or board, with a hollow profile 6 attached movable around a vertical axis to the plate 4 respectively forming part thereof. The profile 6 is provided with supports 16 for the horizontal profiles 8 to be positioned between the plates 4 across the unloading opening 3 .
