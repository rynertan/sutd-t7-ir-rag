# Apparatus and method for testing semiconductor memory devices.

## Abstract
An address pattern generator 10 generates an address pattern which successively specifies the X Y addresses of each memory cell of a semiconductor memory device 14 which is to be tested. An address changeover part 11 ac cesses the semiconductor memory device 14 with the ad dress pattern supplied by the address pattern generator 10 in a normal mode, and accesses the semiconductor memory 14 with an address pattern supplied by the address pattern generator 10 in which predetermined addresses are inter changed in a swap mode. A comparator 13 compares data read out from the semiconductor memory device 14 with an expected value to detect hardware error, and a fail memory de vice 12 stores information concerning the existence or non existence of hardware error in each of the memory cells of the semiconductor memory device 14 into an address region corresponding to that of the semiconductor memory device 14 . The semiconductor memory device 14 and the fail mem ory device 12 both receive common X Y addresses from the address changeover part 11 . The comparator 13 is inhibited in its comparing operation by a signal supplied from said fail memory device 12 for the memory cells of the semiconductor memory device 14 corresponding to the memory cells of the fail memory device 12 which have information stored therein indicating the existence of hardware errors.
