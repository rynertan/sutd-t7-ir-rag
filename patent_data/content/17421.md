# Photographic reproportioning apparatus.

## Abstract
A photographic reproportioning apparatus for changing one dimension of an image has a main travel board 29 supporting a sub travel board 31 both moving linearly. The photosensitive member moves relative to an opaque mask 116, 117 having an exposure window 124 . Motion trans mitting structure 99, 111 moves both sub travel board at the same speed or less, comprising adjustable control bar 68 , connected to first drive 99 on main travel board, which drive drives second drive 111 on main travel board and sub travel board. Speed of first drive depends on angular position of speed control bar 68 relative to path of main travel board and its speed. First drive rotates wheel 107 , which is used to change linear image to arcuate image. A second tapered window 128 on mask 116, 117 diverges from axis of rotation of wheel providing even light exposure along length of exposure line, when wheel and main travel board are used to make an arcuate image.
