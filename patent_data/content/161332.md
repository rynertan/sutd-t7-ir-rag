## Description
ELASTOMERIC PAVEMENT MARKER TECHNICAL FIELD This invention pertains to pavement markers used in delineating traffic lanes on highways. BACKGROUND Historically, pavement markings have fallen into three basic classes 1 Painted lines having glass spheres embedded in a polymeric material o provide some degree of retroreflection 2 Preformed tapes comprised of polymeric film having an adhesive on one side and a layer of glass spheres on the cther and 3 Raised pavement markers providing discrete points of a retroreflective material. Raised pavement markers offer a greater degree of night delineation or retroreflection, wet or dry, than is offered by painted lines and tapes. Most commercial forms of raised lane delineators comprise a flat bottomed disk or base ceramic, polymeric or metal having a raised portion which carries a reflector portion made of reflective glass microspheres or cube corner reflector inserts. After the passage of time, these devices can move or slide out of position under the repeated impact of vehicle wheels. Raised markers or delineators have found wide application in road markings, but their application would be even wider except for some disadvantages, specifically cost more expensive than tape or reflective paint , poor durability broken upon impact, scratched reflective surface, etc. and placement, requiring curable adhesives epoxy , holes or anchors to remain in place. In geographic areas in which roadways must be plowed to clear them of snow, such lane delineators are quickly removed by the plowing operation. Furthermore, raised markers made of a hard or heavy material could cause property damage and injury if they were thrown into the air by a snowplow, e.g., breakiny a passing motorist s windshield. Some known pavement markers have a raised rubber reflecting portion or tab which is intended to bend over under a vehicle tire. Others have a reflecting portion which is supposed to retract into a recess in the pavement.The former type is illustrated by U.S. Patents 4,111,581 3,963,362 3,879,148 and 3,785,719. In all of these patents, the reflecting portion is a flat reflectorized rubber piece or tab rising ahove the pavement surface. The tab is supported at its bottom by attachment to the base portion. These designs suffer frond at least two disadvantages a. fatigue at the joint between the reflecting tab and the base causing the tab to fail to recover to its intended position or to simply lie flat and b. creasing or breaking of the reflector due to the flexiny of the tab at some point inbetween its top and the base. The forces exerted by a moving vehicle tire on a pavement marker are complex and change as the tire traverses the marker.Vertical tab markers actually tend to crimp or bend in the niddle before bendiny near the base. Markers having reflecting surface tabs oriented at an obtuse angle to the road surface, tend to lose reflectivity rapidly due to the action of dirt and grit as tires pass over the reflector. The object of this invention is a raised pavement marker offering a high degree of reflectivity, low cost, ease of placement with adequate durability, and safety while alleviatiny the support and creasing problems of prior raised rubber markers. Another object is to provide a preformed tape offering the same advantages of high reflectivity, low cost, and gooci durability. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION A roadway marker is provided which comprises a body having an approximately flat base portion which can be attached to a roadway, and which has a raised surface adapted to face oncoming traffic when the marker is mounted on a road, and a reflective material attached to said raised surface, said body being made of an elastomer and having a compressive strength see ASTM specificationD1056 at 25 percent compression of less than about 14.5 pounds per square inch about 100 kPa . That is, a compressive force of less than about 100 kPa will compress the material 25 . Normally its compressive strength at 25 compression is at least 6 psi 41 kPa . Compressive strength is measured by ASTM test specification D1056. It has been found that the use of a soft, easily compressed elastomer, preferably a sponge or cellular polymer cellular rubber , as the body of the raised marker reduces the impact forces generated when the marker is struck by a vehicle tire. A retroreflective film may be applied to the foam to provide the desired reflective properties. Pavement markers tested in reducing this invention to practice exhibited brightness far beyond conventional paints or tapes, and similar to that of known raised pavement markers. In addition, these markers reflected effectively both wet and dry. These markers may also utilize pressure sensitive adhesive on te bottom for adheriny to the road surface, making their placement very easy by simply pressing them to the surface. Several other advantages are realized over known raised markers 1 The marker bodies can be produced in continuous extruding equipment rather than in molds or by joining various components. The polymeric body is extruded and cut to the desired length. The pressure sensitive adhesive and reflective sheeting can also be applied by continuous means. 2 No recess or hole in the roadway is required, as is the case with many other types of pavement markers. 3 Compression of the marker body material itselE is a significant contributing factor to the deformation of the marker under the vehicle wheel, in addition to bending which seems to be the major mode of deformation in known deformable or retractable pavement markers. Solid rubber markers do not generally compress as well as cellular polymers. Physically, all raised pavement markers except those which retract into holes in the road exert sufficient force to actually raise the vehicles some finite height. The greater this height becomes, the more force is exerted upon the marker by each vehicle which is forced to deviate frcn its path. The use of cellular elastomers sponge rubbers for the body minimizes this force since they compress well. The uncompressed marker height is normally in the range of 5 mm to 25 mm, and is preferably no greater than 20 mm. Reflective tapes for such purposes as lane delineation can take advantage of the same principle. That is, they can be made of slightly raised foam or cellular polymer which easily compresses under the weight of a vehicle tire. Preferably, the total thickness of the tape is up to about 2.5 mm maximum. With ordinary tapes, much of the frictional force from a vehicle tire are believed to be transmitted to the interface between the adhesive and the road. Known tapes can smear, break or slide under these forces, e.g. the shear stress created by a tire being turned on a tape. The cellular polymer would dampen these applied forces, reducing the effect on the adhesive interface. The tape could be produced by cutting a strip of foam polymer from a cylinder of such material and applyiny a reflective layer to the strip. The reflective preferably retroreflective layer could be applied by reverse roll coating polyurethane to the foam strip and next placing glass beads on the polyurethane while it is still wet. A pressure sensitive adhesive may be placed on the bottom surface for adhereing to the road surface. The type of raised pavement markers disclosed herein may be produced at very low cost, therefiy allowing placement of a series of numerous markers so drivers would see a continuous stripe along the road. Where reflector height is 9.5 mm and viewing distance is about 61 meters the markers should be placed at about 760 mm intervals for reflecting from automobile headlights.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIX,. 1 shows the components of one embodiment of this invention. Item 2 is an elastomeric body, for example made of a sponge elastomer such as polyurethane, silicone rubber, ethylene propylene diene terpolymer EPDM , neoprene or blends of EPDM and neoprene. Adhesive layer 3 is attached to the base of the body, and reflecting material 4 is attached to the raised reflecting surface portion 5 of the body. A surprisingly small amount of adhesive is necessary to hold these flexible foam markers on the road e.g., peel strength of 4.2 pounds per inch, 0.74 kN R . The angle 8 between the reflecting surface and the base or between the reflecting surface and the road surface is usually between 45 and 1350, preferably between 45 and 900. Reflecting portion 4 is preferably thin retroreflective sheet comprising a polymeric support sheet in which a monolayer of transparent microspheres or beads are embedded to slightly more than half their diameter.The glass beads carry a coating of reflective material such as aluminum over their embedded surfaces. The reflector support sheet has a layer of adhesive on the back by which it is adhered to the pavement marker body as shown. For wet reflection, enclosed lens sheeting appears to perform best ti.e , glass beads covered by a clear polymer layer although an exposed lens sheeting and cube corner reflectors may also be used. Reinforcement may be used within the body e.g., fiberglass fabric or fibers to strengthen the markers. As mentioned earlier, the pavement marker bodies of this invention can be made by an extrusion process. The manufacture of cellular or sponge rubbers in an extrusion process is known. The uncured elastomer is generally compounded with vulcanizing chemicals and a blowing agent at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent. A suitable EPDM sponge rubber is described in Borg, P.L., Ethylene Propylene Rubber , in RubberTechnology, 2d ed., Morton, M. ed., Van Nostrand ReinholdCompany, New York, 1973, at pages 242 and 243.Further description of sponge rubber is found in Otterstedt, C.W., closed Cell Sponge Rubber , in The Vanderbilt RubberHandbook, R.T. Vanderhilt Co., Inc., Norwalk, Conn., 1978, at pages 728 729. The compound is extruded through a die of specified shape. The extrudate is then cured and simultaneously expanded at elevated temperature. Curing may be done in a brine both at about 204 C. After the body material extrudate has been cured, a reflective preferably retroreflective film is applied to the raised surface adapted to face oncoming traffic, generally by use of an adhesive such as a pressure sensitive adhesive. The retroreflective film is preferably of the type known as wide angle flat top sheet which comprises a back reflector an overlying transparent matrix a light returning layer of small transparent spheres embedded in the transparent matrix in optical connection with the back reflector hut spaced from it a distance to increase substantially the brilliance of reflected light and a transparent overlying solid covering and conforming to the front extremeties of the spheres and having 1 flat front face.Such sheeting reflects a cone of light back toward a light source, even though the incident beam strikes the reflector at an angle other than perpendicular to the sheeting. One patent on the subject of such sheeting is U.S. Patent 2,407,680. The transparent film occupyiny the space between the spheres and the reflector is called the spacing film. This wide angle flat top sleeting can be considered an embedded lens or enclosed lens sheeting having a spacing film or layer with a thickness which locates the back reflector at the approximate focal point of the optical system. Wide angle flat top retroreflective sheeting 8y be made, for example, by a solution casting technique comprising the following process steps a providing a paper carrier web coated with a release agent such as polyethylene b a coating the release agent side of the carrier web with a 25 solids solution of fully reacted aliphatic elastomeric polyurethane of the polyester type in an isopropanol, toluene, xylene solvent e.g., Or3787 fromK. J.Quinn Company in Malden, Massachusetts in sufficient amount to yield about a 50 microns dry film thickness c drying the coating from step h for example at about 93 C for 15 minutes d applying a bead bond coat about 5 microns thick of. the sa1nC polyurcthane Inaterial useti in step b to the dry coating form step c and contactiny the wet polyurethane surface with glass microspheres e.g., about 20 microns diameter and 2.26 refractive index e drying the microsphere coated web for example at 930C for 5 minutes f coating a spacing layer polymer of the same aliphatic elastomeric polyurethane composition onto the microsphere covered web or sheet from step e in sufficient amount to yield a dry film thickness about equal to the focal length of the microspheres g drying the sheeting from step f h vapor coating the spacing layer with a specularly reflective material e.g., aluminium i removing the paper carrier web and j coating the back side of the reflective material with an acrylate base pressure sensitive adhesive having a silicone coated release liner. A polyurethane hard coating may be applied to the front surface of the sheeting to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the sheeting in use. Such a hard coating has a generally tack free surface and substantially higher 100 modulus of elasticity and lower ultimate elongation than the polyurethane used for the transparent matrix in the reflective sheeting. A typical suitable hard coat polymer is K. J. Quinn Oft515 having a 100 modulus of 5840 psi 40.2 SPa and 210 ultimate elongation, fully reacted aliphatic elastomeric polyurethane of the polyester type. The polyurethane polymers used for the transparent matrix and spacing layers are useful because they are somewhat elastic and can follow the movement of the pavement marker body without delaminating. Finally, an adhesive is applied to the bottom surface of the marker body. Preferably, it is a phenolic modified polybutadiene E,ressure sensitive adhesive at least about 250 microns thick cast on a disposable paper liner.The liner is removed prior to placement of the marker on the road surface. The markers may be applied to the road by at least two methods. tine such method is removing the adhesive liner and pressing the marker to the road surface or onto other marking materials tape or paint . A second method comprises applying the markers to a tape which is thereafter applied to the road. Hollow cross section markers may help to dissipate the heat of compression better than solid foam, and they may compress better, offering less resistance to vehicles travelling over them. One hollow prototype of this invention was the D cross section of PIG. 3. In that embodiment, body 8 had reflecting layer 11 adhered to its curved surface and adhesive layer 10 adhered to its straight side. In the case of hollow markers, it is believed that water can become entrapped within the hollow cross section, and the rapid, repeated compression under vehicle loading may cause rupture at any weak points. It has been found that design of the shape of the marker contributes to an extension of durability and prolonging reflectivity. The shape of the marker in FIG. 1 also does not have the potential waster entrapment problem of the D cross section. To increase durability, marker shapes of this invention provide some form of lateral or back support for the reflector, unlike the markers with raised reflective rubber Lairs discussed in the background section. The body has a connecting portion which joins the base and the back side of the raised surface which it supports. For example, the marker of Tri . 1 supports the whole back of the reflector 4 with raised body portion 5. The reflecting portion is not simply a thin pliable tab in the roadway, as with the older designs. In the embodiment of FIG. 7, the connecting portion forms an acute angle with the plane of the bottom of the base portion and has two ribs located on the back side of said connecting portion oriented parallel to the plane of the base. More than two such ribs can be usel. An alternative embodiment of the invention, shown in PIG. 8, comprise3 an elastomeric body with the compressive strength and base as described above but having a a portion with a diamond shaped cross section oriented such that at least one of its surfaces is a raised surface adapted to face oncoming traffic when the marker is mounted on a road, to which raised surface is attached a reflective material and b at least one protective rib forming a part of the base, which rib together with the rest of the base defines a depression into which the diamond shaped porticn is folded approximately flat under the load of a vehicle wheel usually at least about 96 kPa , the top of the diamond shaped portion being about as high as or lower than the top of the protective rib when under such load. The marker should be placed so that there is at least one protective rib located in front of raised surface adapted to face oncoming traffic. The height of the protective rib is generally a minimum of 45 of the height of the diamond shaped portion, as measured from the bottom of the base. However, it should not be so high as to obscure the reflecting material. The ribs are believed to protect the diamond shaped portion from stress concentration which would hasten its deterioration. Thus the protected diamond shape should have a longer service life. As mentioned in the background section, there is also a tendency of flat reflectors to flex in the middle under vehicle loading. Certain design factors shown in the drawings are helpful in avoiding this tendency and cause the reflecting surface of the inventive marker to lie flat or approximately parallel to the base under a load of at least about 100 kPa as shown in FIGS. 2 and 7 protectiny them from scuffing in the case of the designs shown inPIGS. 1, 2, 6, and 7 . Some of these features are a. the rounding of corners, and b. relief cuts shown, such as that labelled nurnber 6 in FIG. 1 and those labelled number 7 inFIG. 6. The base in the FIG. 1 and FIG. 6 markers extends to a position rearward of the raised surface 4, and the body extends from said rearward position to the back of the raised surface through its connecting portion. The characteristic of lying flat under a load is obtained using the sponge rubbers described previously. It can also be attained by using normal vulcanized rubbers in a hollow configuration. In the case of the protected diamond design ofFIG. 8, the hollow diamond shaped protion is joined to the base along the line defined by one of the corners of the diamond shape and is oriented so that at least one of its surfaces is a raised surface adapted to face oncoming traffic. In that embodiment the reflecting layer is adhered to at least one such surface. Faith this shape, the back of the reflecting surface is inherently supported at the top and bottom by the portions of the diamond that connect to it at an angle. The two protective ribs running parallel to and on opposite sides of the elongated sides of the diamond extend the life of the marker over that of similar designs without the ribs. The aspect ratios width at the widest point divided by height for the diamond shape and the ribs are preferably in the ranyes of 0.6 to 1.0 and about 1 to 1.3 respectively. Height of the diamond shape is measured from the point where it joins the base, and height of the ribs is measured from the bottom of the marker. Other embodiments of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein. Various omissions, modifications and changes to the principles described herein may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention which is indicated by the following claims.
