## Description
APPARATUS AND METHOD OF FORMING SET OF SINGLE CRYSTAL SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL This invention relates generally to material processing, and more particularly the invention relates to apparatus for ad the method of forming thin layers of material such as semiconductor material.Much attention is being directed to harnessing solar energy, particularly in the conversion of solar energy to electrical energy by photovoltaic means. The usual silicon cell is a PN junction semiconductor photovoltaic device which has found particular utility in space applications.Due to the relatively low efficiency of the silicon solar cell and the expense of single crystal silicon wafers from which such cells are typically fabricated, electrical energy from such devices is too expensive for most applications.Efforts at reducing the cost of electrical energy from silicon cells have focused on the fabrication pf the silicon material. Alternatives to the growing of ingots from which the wafers are sliced Include the growth of single crystal ribbons and the formation of dendr,te webs.Mobil Tyco Solar Energy Corporation ras performed much work in growing sing crystal silicon rIbbons This process is called edge defined, film fed growth EFG In the EFG pro cess, capillary action causes molte silicon to rise inside tile narrow cha nel of a die. A silicon ribbon seed is then brought into contact with the liquid at the top of the die, and the temperature is adjusted so that ribbon from within the die begins to solidify on the seed ribbon.As the seed is pulled upward, a crystalline ribbon grows downward so that the Interface between the melt and the crystal stays just above the die. The dimensions at the top of the die determine the.shape of the ribbon.In the dendritic web process the web portion of a crystal is initially a film of liquid silicon bounded by a crystal button and supporting dendrites. As this film freezes, the web and dendrites form an essentially single crystal sheet.In both processes great care must be taken in pulling the thin ribbons of silicon to prevent fracture of the solidified silicon.Among other approaches at forming lower cost silicon substrates for photovoltaic cells there is chemical vapor deposition including the vapor deposition of silicon on a liquid tin layer on a graphite substrate to form polycrystalline films.An object of the present invention is an improved method of forming thin layers of material.Another object of the invention is a method for economically forming a sheet of semiconductor material including single crystal and large grain polycrystalline semiconductor material.Yet another object q the invention is apparatus for forming thin layers of material including single crystal and large grain polycrystalline semiconductor material.In accordance with the invention, a container is provided which has a generally cylindrical interior surface. Means is provided for rotating the container about the axis of the generally cylindrical interior surface, and heater means is provided for heating the container.Means is provided formoving the container with respect to the heater means whereby the coata.i cl3L can be increnintalIy cooled,In forming a sheet of material with the apparatus ,the material is placed in the container, and the container is rotated and heated above the melting point of the material whereby a liquid layer of the material forms on the interior surface of the con trainer. The rotating container is slowly cooled beginning at one end thereof whereby the material solidifies as a thin layer confined by the interior surface. The interior surface may include a confined area for retaining the melted material.Advantageously, the confined area can include a neck portion at the initially cooled end of the container for effecting single crystal material growth.A second material heavier than the first material may be added to the container with the temperature of the container raised above the melting point of both the first and the second materials, whereby the layer of first material forms on the second material.Alternatively, a second material in the shape of a hollow cylinder with thin walls can be placed in the confined portion. The second material has a melting point above that of the first material and is wet by the first material. The temperature of the container is raised above the melting point of the first material and below that of the second material, and the second material is then solidified on and sticks to the second material.The invention and objects and features thereof will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description and appended claims when taken with the drawings.Figure 1 illustrates one erffiodiment of apparatus for carrying out the method of material formation in accordance with the invention.Figure 2 is a plz.l view of the interior surface of the container and the apparatus of Figure i.Figure 3 is a perspective view of a sheet of material formed in accsidanee with the invention.Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of apparatus for forming thin layers of material in accordance with the invention. The apparatus includes a container 10 having a generally cylindrIcal shaped interior surface which is positioned within a suitable furnace such as an R. F. furnace having coils 8 in section .The R. F. heater is open at either end whereby the container 10 can be moved through the coils 8. Since in the formation of semiconductor layers, such as silicon layers, the container will be exposed to temperatures in excess of 14000C the container preferably is made of a refractory material such as graphite. The interior surface of container 10 may have an elevated portion 13 and a closed end 14 so that the liquid material is confined within the container. As will be described further hereinbelow, the confined surface portion of container 10 includes a neck portion for effecting single crystalline material growth. Container 10 is rotatably supported by means of member 20 which is attached to container 10 at the closed end 14 and is rotatably mounted in supports 24 and 26, respectively. Member 20 extends through support 26 and is rotated by motor 30 through a suitable gear train 32.Supports 24 and 26 are mounted on base plate 28. Base plate 28 is slidably mounted on guide rods 34 by means of bushings or bearings 36. Support 28 is linearly moveable along guide rods 34 by means of drive screw 40 which is driven hy drive motor 42 through suitable gear train 44.Thus, container 10 can be rotated by means of motor 30 and linearly driven through the RF heater by means of drive motor 42.Figure 2 is a plan view of the interior surface of cortailler 10 of Fi guY e 1 Wi i il the containerunrolled for illustration purposes. The surface includes a confined portion 15 includiny neck portion 16 which accommodates the liquid material as the container is rotated within the RF heater coils 8. The confined portion may be defined by recessing the interior surface or by forming a raised border around the confined portion for retention of liquid material. Further, the angle and other dimensions of the neck portion and of the remainder of the confined surface portion are for illustration only and can be varied to achieve desired crystal growth and accommodate the film thickness.By slowing cooling the container beginning at the end including neck 16, single crystal growth of the solidi fied material is effected as the solidification emerges from the neck portion. This process is commonly referred to as directional freezing. A similar process is employed in theBridgeman technique which is well known for single crystal growth. However, in the Bridgeman technique the neck portion is formed at one end of a container and a solid ingot is fo çed by cooling the melted material beginning at the neck portion.The Bridgeman process is three dimensional in forming a single crystal ingot, whereas the present invention relates to a quasi two dimensional process leading to a single crystal sheet.In forming a thin layer of material such as silicon using the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1, silicon material is placed in container 10 and heated above 14100C the melting point of silicon , with the container rotating at several hundred revolt tions per minute for a ten centimeter diameter container whereby the liquid silicon covers the generally cylindrical interior surface of the container due to centrifugal force.The silicon material can be pre doped, for example with borcn or phosphorous, to have properties which are necessary for solar cell applications or for other device applications. Container 10 is slowly removed from the furnace with the molten silicon solidifying beginning at the neck portion 16 whereby a single crystal structure emerges from the neck portion. By slowly removing the container from the furnace e.g. 1 cm per minute the single crystal growth can be maintained as the liquid material solidifies. The thicJzness of the Ò rWaJ layer can be ccntrolled by proper combination of amount of material placed In tulle clirdex and the rotation speed of the cylinder. Thus, the promlneni force on the film is gcverned by rotation speed, i.e. centrifugal force, and not surface tension or gravity. In addition, the rotation increases the uniformity of the temperature gradient of the material which is necessary for proper crystal growth.In the formation of single crystal silicon, a second material with a higher density than silicon is preferably placed in the furnace, also. The second material may be an immiscible material such as lead. Besides decreasing contamination, the second material liquid at the silicon crystal solidification temperatures and upon which the silicon floats provides a very high mobility surface for the silicon nuclei which enhances single crystal growth. The melting point of the second material must be less than the melting point of the first material whereby the first material solidifies on a liquid film of second material.Assuming the formation of single crystalline silicon on lead, the two materials may be added to the furnace in solid form priox to heating. Alternatively, either or both materials can be added in liquid form through the open end of the heated cae tainer.Alternatively, in the formation of a single crystal sheet on a substrate for solar cell use, a substrate such as Mullite, which is wet by silicon, is placed in the confined portion of the container. The substrate has the shape of a thin wall hollow cylinder and has a melting point above that of silicon.The silicon solidifies on and sticks to the substrate.If improved single crystal structure is desired after formation of the solidified thin layer of material, zone melting roces sing thereof can be effected by means of an electron beam ring heater or other suitable means for heating a confined, annular zone of the material ihe electron bern ring heater is slow Thj moved along the length of the layer of material as the container is rotated causing a molton zone to move along the le ig ch Or the material, as in converluional zone melting of semiconductor ingots. The scarper heating gradient prociuced by the elect.on beam can enhaXrlce the crystalline structure by minimizing spur ious crystal growth, as is effected in the conventional zone melting crystal growing technique for semiconductor ingotsAfter formation of the thin layer of material, the layer or substrate and layer is scribed at the neck end and axially along the layer or substrate and layer , and the material is then removed by means of a vacuum chuck.The layer may then be unfolded to form a generally planar sheet of material 50 as illustrated in Figure 3.The resulting sheet size, depending on container dimensions, can be quite large thus avoiding the present practice of assembling many small cells to make a photovoltaic array. Further, the time required to produce the sheets compared to the time required in present commercial techniques is low with minimum use of heating power. The process can be employed to form layers of other semiconductor materials as well as other metallic elements and compounds.Thus, while the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the inventionVarious modifications and applications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
