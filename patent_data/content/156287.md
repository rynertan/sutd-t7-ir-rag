# Process for labeling nucleic acids using psoralen derivatives.

## Abstract
A labeling reagent of the formula A rsqbstr B rsqbstr L is prepared where A is an alkylating intercalation moiety, B is a divalent organic spacer arm moiety with a straight chain of at least two carbon atoms, and L is a monovalent label moiety capable of producing a detectable signal, e.g., a signal detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, chemical, immunochemical or biochemical means. Preferably A is a 4 min methylene substituted psoralen moiety, and most preferably A is a 4 min methylene substituted 4,5 min ,8 trimethylpsoralen moiety. This reagent may be used to label nucleic acids, preferably DNA, by intercalating the alkylating intercalation moiety of the reagent into an at least partially double stranded nucleic acid to form a complex and activating the complex to cause covalent bonding between the reagent and the nucleic acid. Preferably, the labeled nucleic acid is a hybridization probe for detecting nucleic acid sequences capable of hybridizing with a hybridizing region of the nucleic acid. Also preferably the label moiety is non radioactive. This reagent may also be used in chromosome banding to label specific regions of chromosomes and thereby differentiate them.
