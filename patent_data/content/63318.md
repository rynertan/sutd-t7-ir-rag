# Low power, freon refrigeration assisted air separation.

## Abstract
Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen are produced from the separation of air in an installation of reduced size wherein the refrigeration necessary for the operation of the air separation unit 55, 56 is produced from the use of a single compander 34, 48 and a freon refrigeration unit 41, 42 affixed to a split out stream 39 of the main heat exchanger 44 with appropriate recycling and heat exchange. The process for such an installation is also set forth.
