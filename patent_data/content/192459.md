# Recovery of base metal values from base metal and iron bearing sulfide materials.

## Abstract
Iron bearing base metal sulfide concentrates or ores, notably iron containing zinc sulfide concentrates, are proces sed to recover zinc values therefrom by partially desulfuriz ing the base metal sulfide values to oxide form. By maintain ing adequate residual sulfide sulfur, iron is maintained in the ferrous state upon oxidation to oxide form, so that the formulation of base metal ferrites and sulfates is prevented. Hydrometallurgical treatment of the roast residue removes base metal oxide values simultaneously with or sequentially with the removal of ferrous iron oxide values from the roast residue. Residual unremoved base metal sulfide values may be recycled to the roasting step to effect high overall recoveries of base metal values from the original concen trate.
