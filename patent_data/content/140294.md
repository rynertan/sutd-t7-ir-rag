# Plasma processing method and apparatus for carrying out the same.

## Abstract
A plasma processing method and an apparatus for carrying out the method are disclosed in which a processing gas is introduced into a processing chamber 10, 25, 50 , and a periodically amplitude or frequency modulated high frequency voltage is applied to plasma generating means 13, 14 28, 29 56, 48 , to generate a discharge plasma and to carry out predetermined processing by the plasma.
