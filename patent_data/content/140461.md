# Simple brushless dc fan motor with reversing field.

## Abstract
A simplified fan and brushless DC motor 10 employs an annular permanent magnet 14 magnetized in segments about its circumference. Each segment is oppositely radially magnetized with respect to its adjacent segments. Fan blades 17 are located within the annular magnet 14 . A coil comprising two electrically independent and bifilar wound windings L1 and L2 , connected to be oppositely energized, and an electromagnet structure defining two pole pieces 48 and 49 reside outside the permanent magnet annulus. A Hall effect device H1 , alternately energizes the separate coil windings L1 and L2 in response to passage of the segments of the rotor magnet 14 to alternately produce opposite magnetic fields in the pole pieces 48 and 49 . Thus commutated, the double coil arrangement affects rotation of the rotor 11 and the fan blades 17 .
