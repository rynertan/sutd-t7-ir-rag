# Apparatus for coating a web with a viscous coating material.

## Abstract
An apparatus for coating a moving web with viscous coating material using an extrusion coating process includes an extrusion coater, a roller for guiding the web, a suction chamber and a die shaped exhaust device characterized in that the vacuum in the suction chamber 30 a maintained exclusively by exhaustion through a clearance space 40 defined along the back wall 38 of the suction chamber by means of the dieshaped suction apparatus. The cross secional area of the exhaust device 46 is from 0.5 to 50 times that of the cross sectional area of the die slot 50 formed in the exhaust device 46 divided by twice the number of exhaust openings 56 provided therein.
