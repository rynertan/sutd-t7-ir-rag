## Description
This invention relates to novel polymeric compositions, transmission fluids i.e. automatic transmission fluids and manual transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids. More particularly, the present invention relates to automatic transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid compositions containing polymeric compositions of the present invention and characterised as having improved shear stability. U.S. Patent No. 3702300 describes nitrogen containing mixed esters of a carboxy containing interpolymer having a reduced specific viscosity of from abut 0.05 to about 2, said ester being subtantially free of titratable acidity and being characterised by the presence within its polymeric structure of at least one of each of three pendant polar groups A a relatively high molecular weight carboxylic ester group having at least 8 aliphatic carbon atoms in the ester radical, B a relatively low molecular weight carboxylic ester group having no more than 7 aliphatic carbon atoms in the ester radical, and C a carbonyl polyamino group derived from a polyamino compound having one primary or secondary amino group, wherein the molar ratio of A B C is 60 90 10 30 2 15 . These esters are described as being viscosity index improving and anti sludge agents for lubricating and fuel compositions. FR A 2245758 describes lubricating oil compositions comprising A about 95 to about 30 percent of a base oil, B at least one extreme pressure agent in an amount sufficient to impart extreme pressure properties thereto, and C at least one oil soluble interpolymer, said interpolymer being a hydrogenated interpolymer of at least one monovinylarene and at least one C₄ ₆ conjugated diene or at least one C₂ ₆ alpha olefin. The interpolymer has a number average molecular weight of about 750 to about 10,000. DE A 2524118 describes a composition for use as a central hydraulic system fluid which comprises a viscosity index improver, another additive and a hydrocarbon type base oil comprising at least one component selected from A polybutenes of 100 500 average molecular weight, B homo or copolymers with an average molecular weight of 100 to 500 of at least one α olefin containing 2 12 carbons, excepting butenes, and C hydrogenation products boiling at 250 380 C of high aromatic components which are obtained by cracking petroleum oils. The problems associated with the lubrication of automatic and manual transmissions and the operation of hydrualic fluid systems are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, in the lubrication of transmissions, proper fluid viscosity at both low and high temperatures is essential to successful operation. Good low temperature fluidity eases cold weather starting and insures that the hydraulic control system will properly shift gears . High viscosity at elevated temperatures insures pumpability and the satisfactory functioning of converters, valves, clutches, gears and bearings. In the operation of hydraulic fluid systems, proper fluid viscosity at both low and high temperatures is essential to successful operation. High temperature viscosity retention is beneficial in lubrication, contributes to streamline flow and reduces leakage. Good low temperature fluidity provides rapid control action, less heating loss and lower pressure drop. These conflicting fluidity requirements call for a product that exhibits the following characteristics In order to prepare lubricants having these characteristics, it has become common practice to add a variety of chemicals to the oil. For example, in order to meet the viscosity requirements, compositions have been added to the oils which are characterized by relatively small change in their viscosity with changing temperature, and they are commonly graded according to SAE standards according to the viscosities at low e.g., 18 Although chemical compositions have been developed which improve the viscosity characteristics of lubricating oil, it is often desirable to further improve the low temperature characteristics by including compositions which function as fluidity modifiers at low temperatures. Fluidity modifiers are capable of lowering the viscosity of a lubricating oil at low temperatures generally by retarding the formation of undesirable microcrystalline wax substances. In addition to the above improvements, it is desirable, if not necessary, that lubricating compositions especially designed for use as transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids exhibit shear stability. Shear stability means that the lubricating oils will not degrade or lose their desirable viscosity characteristics as a result of the shearing forces encountered during their use. Lubricating oil compositions exhibiting desirable shear stability will be found to generally have the viscosity within 85 95 of their original viscosity after a number of hours, e.g., 100 hours of service. It has been recognized that many ordinary viscosity index improvers commonly added to crankcase lubricating oils, such as high molecular weight polyisobutene and polyacrylates, do not possess the desired shear stability for use in improving the viscosity characteristics of transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids. It now has been found that multi grade lubricants exhibiting improved shear stability can be made by utilizing the compositions of the present invention. These lubricants are particularly useful in providing transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a polymeric composition comprising a mixture of Polymeric compositions of the present invention are useful as additives in transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids, and the transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids containing the polymeric compositions of the present invention exhibit improved shear stability while maintaining desirable high and low temperature viscosity characteristics. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a transmission fluid composition having improved shear stability comprising In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a hydraulic fluid having improved shear stability comprising a major amount of a base oil The first component A of the polymeric compositions of the invention is at least one oil soluble polymer which is a homopolymer of a non aromatic monoolefin having at least 3 carbon atoms, said polymer having a number average molecular weight of about 750 to about 10,000. The characterization of these polymers as oil soluble does not necessarily mean they are soluble in all base oils in all proportions. Rather, the polymers are soluble in the base oils with which they are formulated to a degree sufficient to allow the lubricant composition to be multi graded between SAE 75W and SAE 250. The above mentioned homopolymers can be prepared from non aromatic monoolefins having at least 3 carbon atoms and preferably no more than 20 carbon atoms by a number of polymerization techniques well known to those of skill in the art. It should be noted that homopolymer as used herein, describes polymers made from monoolefins having the same number of carbon atoms. Thus, polymers made from a mixture of butene 1 and isobutylene are, in the terms of this specification and the appended claims, homopolymers of butylene. When they contain predominantly units derived from a single isomer, they may be referred to as polymers of that isomer but, such terminology does not exclude the possibility of the presence of a minor amount of units derived from other isomers. Thus, a polyisobutylene polymer might contain units, 80 of which are derived from isobutylene, 15 from 1 butene and 5 from 2 butene. Particularly preferred are homopolymers made from C₃ to C₂₀ monoolefins such as propene, 2 butene, isobutene, hexene 1, decene 3, tetradecene 4, etc. More preferable are homopolymers derived from C₄ to C₈ alpha olefins such as butene, isobutene, pentene 1, heptene 1, etc. The most preferred homopolymers are those of propene and the various butenes. Techniques such as Ziegler, cationic, free radical, anionic, emulsion polymerization and so forth can be used in appropriate circumstances to prepare these polymers. A particularly convenient technique for polymerizing such olefins for use in this invention is through the use of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride, titanium tetrafluoride and the like. These polymerizations are well known in the art and need not be described further at this point. Among the polymers that are useful in the compositions of the present invention are the following a polyisobutene of Mn 1400, a poly 1 octene of Mn 4300, a poly 3 heptene of Mn 900, a poly 1 eicosene of Mn of 9500, a poly 1 nonene of Mn 3700, a poly 2 methyl 1 pentene of Mn 1700, a poly 5 ethyl 1 hexene of Mn of 2200, and a poly 8 methyl 1 tetradecene of Mn 1900. In general, it is preferred that the homopolymers of the present invention, i.e., component A , for reasons of oxidative stability, contain no more than 5 unsaturation on the basis of the total number of carbon to carbon covalent linkages present within an average molecule. Such unsaturation can be measured by a number of means well known to those of skill in the art, such as infrared, NMR, etc. More preferably these polymers contain no discernable unsaturation. A particularly preferred polymer meeting all of the above requirements is polyisobutene, although other polymers such as polypropylene may also prove equally useful and desirable. The transmission fluids of the invention preferably contain from about 0.1 to about 20 by weight of component A . The hydraulic fluids of the invention preferably contain from about 0.1 to about 20 , more preferably about 2 to about 10 by weight by weight of component A . Component B 1 of the compositions of the invention is at least one nitrogen containing ester of a carboxy containing interpolymer, said interpolymer having a reduced specific viscosity of from about 0.05 to about 2, Component B 2 of the hydraulic fluids of the invention is at least one oil soluble acrylate polymerization product of at least one ester of the formula Mixtures of B 1 and B 2 also are useful within the compositions of the invention, particularly with respect to hydraulic fluids. As can be seen from the above, in one embodiment of the invention, the nitrogen containing ester of a carboxy containing interpolymer B 1 contains within its polymer structure, at least two polar groups which are derived from the carboxy groups of said interpolymer. These polar groups are In reference to the size of the ester groups, it is pointed out that an ester group is represented by the formula When the nitrogen containing ester B 1 contains only polar groups a and b , the molar ratio of a to b is generally within the range of from about 85 15 to about 99 1, and an especially preferred ratio is 95 5. It should be noted that the linkage described as the carbonyl polyamino group may be amide, imide, or amidine, and inasmuch as any such linkages contemplated within the present invention, the term carbonylpolyamino is adopted as being a convenient, generic expression useful for the purpose of defining the polar groups b . In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the linkage is imide or predominantly imide. Another important element of component B 1 is the molecular weight of the carboxy containing interpolymer. For convenience, the molecular weight is expressed in terms of the reduced specific viscosity of the interpolymer which is a widely recognized means of expressing the molecular size of a polymeric substance. As used herein, the reduced specific viscosity abbreviated as RSV is the value obtained in accordance with the formula wherein the relative viscosity is determined by measuring, by means of a dilution viscometer, the viscosity of a solution of one gram of the interpolymer in 100 ml. of acetone and the viscosity of acetone at 30 0.02 C. For purpose of computation by the above formula, the concentration is adjusted to 0.4 gram of the interpolymer per 100 ml. of acetone. A more detailed discussion of the reduced specific viscosity, also known as the specific viscosity, as well as its relationship to the average molecular weight of an interpolymer, appears in Paul J. Fory, While interpolymers having a reduced specific viscosity of from about 0.05 to about 1 are contemplated in the present invention, the preferred interpolymers are those having a reduced specific viscosity of from about 0.2 or 0.35 to about 0.8 or 1. Interpolymers having a reduced specific viscosity of from about 0.35 to about 0.5 or from about 0.65 to about 0.75 are particularly useful. Mixtures of two or more compatible i.e., nonreactive to one another interpolymers which are separately prepared are contemplated herein for use in the esterification reaction, if each has a RSV as above described. Thus, as used herein, and in the appended claims, the terminology interpolymer refers to either one separately prepared interpolymer or a mixture of two or more of such interpolymers. A separately prepared interpolymer is one in which the reactants and or reaction conditions are different from the preparation of another interpolymer. The interpolymers are copolymers, terpolymers, and other interpolymers of alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, or mixtures of two or more of any of these, and one or more vinyl aromatic monomers having up to 12 carbon atoms. The derivatives of the dicarboxylic acid are derivatives which are polymerizable with the monoolefinic compound, and as such, may be the esters and anhydrides of the acids. Copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene are especially suitable, and such interpolymers having a RSV in the range from about 0.3 to about 1.8 particularly 0.3 to about 0.9 are preferred. Suitable alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or lower alkyl esters thereof useful in the preparation of the interpolymers include those wherein a carbon to carbon double bond is in an alpha, beta position to at least one of the carboxy functions e.g., itaconic acid, anhydride or lower esters thereof and preferably, in an alpha, beta position to both of the carboxy functions of the alpha, beta dicarboxylic acid, anhydride or the lower alkyl ester thereof e.g., maleic acid, anhydride or lower alkyl esters thereof . Normally, the carboxy functions of these compounds will be separated by up to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 2 carbon atoms. A class of preferred alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, anhydrides or the lower alkyl esters thereof, includes those compounds corresponding to the formulae including the geometric isomers thereof, i.e., cis and trans wherein each R is independently hydrogen halogen e.g., chloro, bromo, or iodo hydrocarbyl or halogen substituted hydrocarbyl of up to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably alkyl, alkaryl or aryl preferably, at least one R is hydrogen and each R is independently hydrogen or lower alkyl of up to about 7 carbon atoms e.g., methyl, ethyl, butyl or heptyl . These preferred alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or alkyl esters thereof contain a total carbon content of up to about 25 carbon atoms, normally up to about 15 carbon atoms. Examples include maleic anhydride benzyl maleic anhydride chloro maleic anhydride heptyl maleate citaconic anhydride ethyl fumarate fumaric acid mesaconic acid ethyl isopropyl maleate isopropyl fumarate hexyl methyl maleate phenyl maleic anhydride and the like. These and other alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic compounds are well known in the art. Of these preferred alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic compounds, maleic anhydride, maleic acid and fumaric acid and the lower alkyl esters thereof are preferred. Interpolymers derived from mixtures of two or more of any of these can also be used. Suitable vinyl aromatic monomers of up to about 12 carbon atoms which can be polymerized with the alpha, beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or lower esters thereof are well known. The nature of the vinyl aromatic monomer is normally not a critical or essential aspect of this invention as these compounds serve primarily as a connective moiety for the alpha, beta unsaturated compounds in forming the interpolymers. The vinyl aromatic compounds include styrene and substituted styrenes such as alpha halostyrenes, lower alkyl substituted styrenes such as alpha methylstyrenes, para tert butylstyrenes, alpha ethylstyrenes, and para lower alkoxy styrenes. Mixtures of two or more vinyl aromatic monomers can be used. Particularly preferred mixed alkyl esters of this invention are those of interpolymers made by reacting maleic acid, or anhydride or the lower esters thereof with styrene. Of these particularly preferred interpolymers those which are made of maleic anhydride and styrene and have a RSV in the range of about 0.3 to about 0.9 are especially useful. Of these latter preferred interpolymers, copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene having a molar ratio of the maleic anhydride to styrene of about 1 1 are especially preferred. They can be prepared according to methods known in the art, as for example, free radical initiated e.g., by benzoyl peroxide solution polymerization. Examples of such suitable interpolymerization techniques are described in U.S. Patents 2,938,016 2,980,653 3,085,994 3,342,787 3,418,292 3,451,979 3,536,461 3,558,570 3,702,300 and 3,723,375. Other preparative techniques are known in the art. The molecular weight i.e., RSV of such interpolymers can be adjusted to the range required in this invention, if necessary, according to conventional techniques, e.g., control of the reaction conditions. From the standpoint of utility, as well as for commercial and economical reasons, nitrogen containing esters in which the ester group a has from 8 to 24 aliphatic carbon atoms, preferably about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms, and most preferably about 14 or 15 carbon atoms, Examples of the carbonyl polyamino group include those derived from polyamino compounds having one primary or secondary amino group and at least one mono functional amino group such as tertiary amino or heterocyclic amino group. Such compounds may thus be tertiary amino substituted primary or secondary amines or other substituted primary or secondary amines in which the substituent is derived from pyrroles, pyrrolidones, caprolactams, oxazolidones, oxazoles, thiazoles, pyrazoles, pyrazolines, imidazoles, imidazolines, thiazines, oxazines, diazines, oxycarbamyl, thiocarbamyl, uracils, hydantoins, thiohydantoins, guanidines, ureas, sulfonamides, phosphoramides, phenolthiazines, amidines, etc. Examples of such polyamino compounds include dimethylamino ethylamine, dibutylamino ethylamine, 3 dimethylamino 1 propylamine, 4 methylethylamino 1 butylamine, pyridyl ethylamine, N morpholino ethylamine, tetrahydropyridylethylamine, bis dimethylamino propylamine, bis diethylamino ethylamine, N,N dimethyl p phenylene diamine, piperidyl ethylamine, 1 aminoethyl pyrazole, 1 methylamino pyrazoline, 1 methyl 4 aminooctyl pyrazole, 1 aminobutyl imidazole, 4 aminoethyl thiazole, 2 aminoethyl triazine, dimethylcarbamyl propylamine, N methyl N aminopropyl acetamide, N aminoethyl succinimide, N methylamino maleimide, N aminobutyl alpha chlorosuccinimide, 3 aminoethyl uracil, 2 aminoethyl pyridine, ortho aminoethyl N,N dimethylbenzenesulfamide, N aminoethyl phenothiazine, N aminoethylacetamidine, 1 aminophenyl 2 methyl imidazoline, N methyl N aminoethyl S ethyl dithiocarbamate, etc. Preferred polyamino compounds include the N aminoalkyl substituted morpholines such as N 3 aminopropyl morpholine. For the most part, the polyamino compounds are those which contain only one primary amino or secondary amino group and, preferably at least one tertiary amino group. The tertiary amino group is preferably a heterocyclic amino group. In some instances polyamino compounds may contain up to about 6 amino groups although, in most instances, they contain one primary amino group and either one or two tertiary amino groups. The polyamino compounds may be aromatic or aliphatic amines and are preferably heterocyclic amines such as amino alkyl substituted morpholines, piperazines, pyridines, benzopyrroles, picolines, quinolines, pyrroles, pyrrolidinones, etc. They are usually alkyl amines having from 4 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to about 12 carbon atoms. Polar substituents may likewise be present in the polyamines. The nitrogen containing esters of the invention B 1 contain at least the two polar groups a and b derived from the carboxy groups of the interpolymer. The nitrogen containing esters of the invention B 1 are most conveniently prepared by first esterifying the carboxy containing interpolymer with the higher molecular weight alcohol or a mixture of the high and low molecular weight alcohols to convert at least about 50 and no more than about 99 of the carboxy radicals of the interpolymer to ester radicals, and then neutralizing the remaining carboxy radicals with a polyamino compound such as described above. When the mixed esters are prepared, the molar ratio of the high molecular weight alcohol to the low molecular weight alcohol used in the process should be within the range of from about 2 1 to about 9 1. In most instances the ratio will be from about 2.5 1 to about 5 1. More than one high molecular weight alcohol or low molecular weight alcohol may be used in the process. Commercial alcohol mixtures such as the so called Oxo alcohols which comprise, for example, mixtures of alcohols having from 8 to about 24 carbon atoms also may be used. A particularly useful class of alcohols are the commercial alcohol mixtures or mixtures of commercial alcohol mixtures comprising octyl alcohol, decyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, tetradecyl alcohol, pentadecyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, heptadecyl alcohol and octadecyl alcohol. Commercial alcohol mixtures of tetradecyl and pentadecyl alcohols are particularly useful. Several suitable sources of these alcohols mixtures are the technical grade alcohols sold under the tradename Neodols by Shell Chemical Corporation and under the tradename Alfols by Continental Oil Company. Other alcohols useful in the process are illustrated by those which, upon esterification, yield the ester groups exemplified above. The extent of esterification, as indicated previously, may range from about 50 to about 99 , preferably about 75 to about 97 , conversion of the carboxy radicals of the interpolymer to ester radicals. In a preferred embodiment, the degree of esterification is about 95 . The esterification can be accomplished simply by heating the carboxy containing interpolymer and the alcohol or alcohol mixtures under conditions typical for effecting esterification. Such conditions usually include, for example, a temperature of at least about 80 C, preferably from about 150 C to about 350 C, provided that the temperature be below the decomposition point of the reaction mixture, and the removal of water of esterification as the reaction proceeds. Such conditions may optionally include the use of an excess of the alcohol reactant so as to facilitate esterification, the use of a solvent or diluent such as mineral oil, toluene, benzene, xylene or the like and an esterification catalyst such as toluene sulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride triethylamine, hydrochloric acid, ammonium sulfate, phosphoric acid, sodium methoxide or the like. These conditions and variations thereof are well known in the art. A particularly desirable method of effecting esterification when mixed esters are desired involves first reacting the carboxy containing interpolymer with the relatively high molecular weight alcohol and then reacting the partially esterified interpolymer with the relatively low molecular weight alcohol. A variation of this technique involves initiating the esterification with the relatively high molecular weight alcohol and before such esterification is complete, the relatively low molecular weight alcohol is introduced into the reaction mass so as to achieve a mixed esterification. In either event it has been discovered that a two step esterification process whereby the carboxy containing interpolymer is first esterified with the relatively high molecular weight alcohol so as to convert from about 50 to about 75 of the carboxy radicals to ester radicals and then with a relatively low molecular weight alcohol to achieve the finally desired degree of esterification results in products which have unusually beneficial viscosity properties. The esterified interpolymer is then treated with a polyamino compound in an amount so as to neutralize substantially all of the unesterified carboxy radicals of the interpolymer. The neutralization is preferably carried out at a temperature of at least about 80 C, often from about 120 C to about 300 C, provided that the temperature does not exceed the decomposition point of the reaction mass. In most instances the neutralization temperature is between about 150 C and 250 C. A slight excess of the stoichiometric amount of the polyamino compound is often desirable, so as to insure substantial completion of neutralization, i.e., no more than about 2 5 of the carboxy radicals initially present in the interpolymer remained unneutralized. The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of the nitrogen containing esters and mixed esters B 1 used in the present invention.

The transmission fluids of the invention preferably contain from about 0.1 to about 10 by weight of component B 1 . The hydraulic fluids of the invention preferably contain from about 0.05 to about 10 , more preferably from about 0.1 to about 4 by weight of component B 1 . The polymeric compositions of the present invention also may include as component B , at least one oil soluble acrylate polymerization product of at least one ester of the formula Compounds of the above types represented by Formula III whose oil soluble polymers are particularly useful for the present purpose are the esters of acrylic acid or of its alpha alkyl or alpha aryl substitution products and monohydric alcohols containing at least four carbon atoms such as the butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, lauryl, myricyl, cetyl, or octadecyl esters of acrylic acid, alpha methacrylic acid, alpha phenylacrylic acid, and other alpha substituted homologues of acrylic acid. These esters are preferably those of the normal, primary saturated aliphatic alcohols, but the analogous esters of the corresponding secondary or of the branched chain alcohols can also be used. The esters of the above acids of the acrylic series with monohydric aromatic, hydroaromatic, or ether alcohols may also be used, such as the benzyl, cyclohexyl, amylphenyl, n butyloxyethyl esters. These esters are employed in the form of their oil soluble polymers which should be as free as possible of unpolymerized monomeric esters, since the presence of unsaturated or volatile compounds in the transmission fluid may be objectionable. Unpolymerized esters can be removed by heating the polymer or the mixture of lubricating oil and polymer in vacuo to a temperature sufficiently high to volatilize the monomeric ester, but preferably the polymerization should be carried out as completely as possible and the latter operation dispensed with. The most effective polymers for the present purpose, from the point of view of availability and power of increasing the desirable properties are the polymerized esters of acrylic acid or alpha methacrylic acid and monohydric, saturated, primary aliphatic alcohols containing from 4 to 22 carbon atoms in the molecule. The esters possessing the highest solubility and stability in oils and giving the highest viscosity index are those derived from the straight chain, monohydric primary, saturated aliphatic alcohols containing 8 to 20 carbon atoms such as the normal octyl, lauryl, cetyl, or octadecyl esters. These esters need not be pure, but may be prepared from technical mixtures of the higher aliphatic alcohols such as are obtained commercially from the catalytic high pressure hydrogenation of fatty acids or their esters. The acrylate ester monomers are prepared by standard esterification techniques through the reaction of acrylic acid or substituted acrylic acid such as methacrylic acid with an alcohol or alcohol mixture such as with technical grades of long chain primary alcohols. These commercially available alcohols are mixtures of n alkanols of various chain lengths containing between about 4 and 22 carbons in the alkyl group. Several suitable sources of these alcohol mixtures are the technical grade alcohols sold under the tradename Neodols by Shell Chemical Corporation and under the tradename Alfols by Continental Oil Company. Any mixture of two or more polymers of the esters set forth herein can also be used. These may be simple mixtures of such polymers, or they may be co polymers which can be prepared by polymerizing a mixture of two or more of the monomeric esters. The polymers are prepared for use in the present process, preferably by heating the monomeric esters at 70 100 C in the presence of small amounts of polymerization inducing catalysts such as peroxides or ozonides. These are referred to as heat polymerization products . Other catalysts may, however, be used, such as anhydrous halides of polyvalent or amphoteric metals, according to the known art of polymerizing vinyl compounds. Procedures for the preparation of acrylate polymers B 2 useful in this invention are known in the art such as in U.S. Patents 2,100,993 3,598,736 and 3,679,644. The hydraulic fluids of the invention preferably contain from about 0.1 to about 10 , more preferably about 0.5 to about 5 by weight of component B 2 . The compositions of the present invention contain C an effective amount of at least one low temperature viscosity reducing liquid organic diluent. Generally, the diluent C is characterized as having a viscosity at 40 C of less than 4 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ 4 centistokes , and more preferably a viscosity at 40 The diluent C may be any organic diluent having the desired viscosity reducing characteristics, and such diluents may be natural or synthetic diluents. Among the preferred organic diluents exhibiting the desirable viscosity characteristics are the naphthenic oils, certain synthetic oils and alkylated aromatic materials. The naphthenic oils which are useful in the compositions of the invention are those derived from naphthenic crudes such as found in the Louisiana area. The viscosity of such naphthenic oils at 40 C generally is less than 4 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ 4 centistokes and more generally within the range of from about 3.0 x 10 ⁶ to about 3.8 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ about 3.0 to about 3.8 centistokes . At 100 C, the viscosity of the desirable naphthenic crudes is within the range of about 0.8 x 10 ⁶ to about 1.6 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ about 0.8 to about 1.6 centistokes . Such naphthenic oils have been found to provide excellent fluidity characteristics to the polymeric compositions of the invention, particularly at low temperature. The synthetic oils useful as diluent C are those having a viscosity at 40 C of from about 2 x 10 ⁶ to 3.8 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ 2.0 to 3.8 centistokes and preferably between about 2.0 x 10 ⁶ and 3.0 x 10 ⁶m².s ¹ 2.0 and 3.0 centistokes . Examples of such oils include the esters of dicarboxylic acids e.g., phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acids, azeleic acid, malonic acid with a variety of alcohols including, for example, butyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, etc. The synthetic oils, especially the ester types, which are useful as diluent C are described in more detail below. The alkylated aromatic materials that are particularly useful as the diluent C in the hydraulic fluid compositions of the invention. These alkylated aromatic materials are preferably mono or di more preferably mono substituted benzenes wherein the substituents are hydrocarbon based groups of about 8 to about 30, preferably about 10 to about 14 carbon atoms. An example is a commercially available mixture of alkylated benzenes containing a 2 maximum of C₁₀, a 10 maximum of C₁₀ ₁₂, 70 90 of C₁₃ ₁₄, and a 5 maximum of C₁₄ hydrocarbon groups. The amount of low temperature viscosity reducing liquid organic diluent included in the compositions of the present invention is an amount which is effective to reduce the viscosity of the composition to the desired level at low temperatures, particularly at temperatures below 0 C. Accordingly, the amount of diluent C included in the polymeric compositions of the invention will depend upon the amounts and relative amounts of components A and B present in the composition, the properties of the particular diluent, and the viscosity characteristics desired in the final product. Generally, the weight ratio of diluent C to the mixture of components A and B will be in the range of about 5 1 to about 1 5. In the case of transmission fluids, the diluent C is preferably present at a level of from about 1 to about 90 by weight. With hydraulic fluids, the diluent C is preferably present at a level of from about 1 to about 35 , more preferably from about 2 to about 10 by weight. The compositions of this invention comprising mixtures of components A , B and C described above are useful in a variety of lubricating compositions formulated for a variety of uses. In particular, the compositions of this invention are useful in the formulation of transmission fluids i.e., both automatic and manual transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids exhibiting improved and desirable low temperature characteristics. The compositions of this invention provide excellent low temperature fluidity. Furthermore, the transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids of the present invention have the unexpected combination of high shear stability, excellent low temperature fluidity, and 100 C viscosity equivalent to conventionally formulated fluids. When the compositions of the present invention comprising components A , B and C are to be utilized in lubricating oil formulations, and in particular, in transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids, the compositions of the present invention will contain, in addition to components A , B and C , other additives which impart certain desirable properties to the transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids. Such additives include, for example, detergents and dispersants of the ash producing or ashless type, corrosion and oxidation inhibiting agents, pour point depressing agents, extreme pressure agents, anti wear agents, rust inhibiting agents, seal swell agents, friction modifiers, color stabilizers and anti foam agents. The ash producing detergents are exemplified by oil soluble neutral and basic salts of alkali or alkaline earth metals with sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, or organic phosphorus acids characterized by at least one direct carbon to phosphorus linkage such as those prepared by the treatment of an olefin polymer e.g., polyisobutene having a molecular weight of 1000 with a phosphorizing agent such as phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus heptasulfide, phosphorus pentasulfide, phosphorus trichloride and sulfur, white phosphorus and a sulfur halide, or phosphorothioic chloride. The most commonly used salts of such acids are those of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium. The term basic salt is used to designate metal salts wherein the metal is present in stoichiometrically larger amounts than the organic acid radical. The commonly employed methods for preparing the basic salts involve heating a mineral oil solution of an acid with a stoichiometric excess of a metal neutralizing agent such as the metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or sulfide at a temperature of about 50 C and filtering the resulting mass. The use of a promoter in the neutralization step to aid the incorporation of a large excess of metal likewise is known. Examples of compounds useful as the promoter include phenolic substances such as phenol, naphthol, alkylphenol, thiophenol, sulfurized alkylphenol, and condensation products of formaldehyde with a phenolic substance alcohols such as methanol, 2 propanol, octyl alcohol, cellosolve, carbitol, ethylene glycol, stearyl alcohol, and cyclohexyl alcohol and amines such as aniline, phenylenediamine, phenothiazine, phenyl beta naphthylamine, and dodecylamine. A particularly effective method for preparing the basic salts comprises mixing an acid with an excess of a basic alkaline earth metal neutralizing agent and at least one alcohol promoter, and carbonating the mixture at an elevated temperature such as 60 200 C. Ashless detergents and dispersants are so called despite the fact that, depending on its constitution, the dispersant may upon combustion yield a non volatile material such as boric oxide or phosphorus pentoxide however, it does not ordinarily contain metal and therefore does not yield a metal containing ash on combustion. Many types are known in the art, and any of them are suitable for use in the lubricant compositions of this invention. The following are illustrative The detergents dispersants, when employed, are used at a level of from about 0.01 to about 20 by weight, or higher depending on the nature of the dispersant. Usually, such detergents dispersants are employed at a level of from about 0.1 to about 15 by weight based on the total weight of the transmission fluid. Extreme pressure agents and corrosion and oxidation inhibiting agents which may be included in the compositions of the invention are exemplified by chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorinated wax organic sulfides and polysulfides such as benzyl disulfide, bis chlorobenzyl disulfide, dibutyl tetrasulfide, sulfurized methyl ester of oleic acid, sulfurized alkylphenol, sulfurized dipentene, and sulfurized terpene phosphosulfurized hydrocarbons such as the reaction product of a phosphorus sulfide with turpentine or methyl oleate, phosphorus esters including principally dihydrocarbon and trihydrocarbon phosphites such as dibutyl phosphite, diheptyl phosphite, dicyclohexyl phosphite, pentylphenyl phosphite, dipentylphenyl phosphite, tridecyl phosphite, distearyl phosphite, dimethyl naphthyl phosphite, oleyl 4 pentylphenyl phosphite, polypropylene molecular weight 500 substituted phenyl phosphite, diisobutyl substituted phenyl phosphite metal thiocarbamates, such as zinc dioctyldithiocarbamate, and barium heptylphenyl dithiocarbamate Group II metal phosphorodithioates such as zinc dicyclohexylphosphorodithioate, zinc dioctylphosphorodithioate, barium di heptylphenyl phosphorodithioate, cadmium dinonylphosphorodithioate, and the zinc salt of a phosphorodithioic acid produced by the reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with an equimolar mixture of isopropyl alcohol and n hexyl alcohol. Many of the above mentioned extreme pressure agents and corrosion oxidation inhibitors also serve as anti wear agents. Zinc dialkylphosphorodithioates are a well known example. Anti wear agents that are particularly useful in the hydraulic fluid compositions of the invention are those anti wear agents made by contacting a salt of a phosphorus acid of the formula R O ₂PSSH, wherein each R is independently a hydrocarbon based group, or the phosphorus acid precursors thereof with at least one phosphite of the formula R O ₃P, wherein R is a hydrocarbon based group, under reaction conditions at a temperature of about 50 C to about 200 C. R is preferably an alkyl group of about 3 to about 50 carbon atoms, and R is preferably aromatic. The salt is preferably a zinc salt, but can be a mixed salt of at least one of said phosphorus acids and at least one carboxylic acid. These anti wear agents are described more fully in U.S. Patent 4,263,150. These anti wear agents as well as the anti wear agents referred to above can be provided in the hydraulic fluid compositions of the invention at levels of about 0.1 to about 5 , preferably about 0.25 to about 1 by weight based on the total weight of said fluid compositions. The oxidation inhibitors that are particularly useful in the hydraulic fluid compositions of the invention are the hindered phenols e.g., 2,6 di t butyl phenol aromatic amines e.g., alkylated diphenyl amines alkyl polysulfides selenides borates e.g., epoxide boric acid reaction products phosphorodithioic acids, esters and or salts and the dithiocarbamate e.g., zinc dithiocarbamates . These oxidation inhibitors as well as the oxidation inhibitors discussed above are preferably present in the hydraulic fluids of the invention at levels of about 0.05 to about 5 , more preferably about 0.25 to about 2 by weight based on the total weight of such compositions. The rust inhibitors that are particularly useful in the hydraulic fluid compositions of the invention are the alkenyl succinic acids, anhydrides and esters, preferably the tetrapropenyl succinic acids, acid esters and mixtures thereof metal preferably calcium and barium sulfonates the amine phosphates and the imidazolines. These rust inhibitors are preferably present in the hydraulic fluids of the invention at levels of about 0.01 to about 5 , preferably about 0.02 to about 1 by weight based on the total weight of said fluids. Pour point depressants may be included in the compositions described herein. The use of such pour point depressants in oil based compositions to improve low temperature properties of oil based compositions is well known in the art. See, for example, page 8 of Lubricant Additives by C.V. Smalheer and R. Kennedy Smith Lezius Hiles Co. publishers, Cleveland, Ohio, 1967 . Examples of useful pour point depressants are polymethacrylates polyacrylates polyacrylamides condensation products of haloparaffin waxes and aromatic compounds vinyl carboxylate polymers and terpolymers of dialkylfumarates, vinyl esters of fatty acids and alkyl vinyl ethers. Pour point depressants useful for the purposes of this invention, techniques for their preparation and their uses are described in U.S. Patents 2,387,501 2,015,748 2,655,479 1,815,022 2,191,498 2,666,746 2,721,877 2,721,878 and 3,250,715. Anti foam agents are used to reduce or prevent the formation of stable foam. Typical anti foam agents include silicones or organic polymers. Additional anti foam compositions are described in Foam Control Agents , by Henty T. Kerner Noyes Data Corporation, 1976 , pages 125 162. When additional additives are used with the compositions of the present invention in formulating transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid compositions, the additional additives are used in concentrations in which they are normally employed in the art. Thus, they will generally be used in a concentration of from about 0.001 up to about 25 by weight of the total composition, depending, of course, upon the nature of the additive and the nature of the automatic transmission fluid composition. The transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid compositions of the present invention may, of course, be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. One convenient method is to combine the composition of the present invention comprising components A , B , and C described above and the additional additives in the form of a concentrated solution or substantially stable dispersion i.e., an additive concentrate to a sufficient amount of a base oil which may be an additional amount of the diluent C described above or any other natural or synthetic oil normally used in the preparation of such transmission fluids or hydraulic fluids to form the desired final transmission fluid or hydraulic fluid composition. Such concentrates contain the additives in proper amounts so as to provide the desired concentration of each additive in the final automatic transmission fluid or hydraulic fluid composition when blended with a predetermined amount of a base oil. As mentioned above, the compositions of the present invention comprising components A , B and C and other optional and desirable additives may be blended with additional diluent such as component C or other natural and synthetic base oils. The base oils used in preparing the transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids of the invention can be natural oils or synthetic oils. Natural oils include animal oils and vegetable oils e.g., castor oil, lard oil as well as mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent treated or acid treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic naphthenic types. Oils of lubricating viscosity derived from coal or shale are also useful. Synthetic lubricating oils include hydrocarbon oils and halosubstituted hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propyleneisobutylene copolymers, chlorinated polybutylenes, etc. poly 1 hexenes , poly 1 octenes , poly 1 decenes , etc. and mixtures thereof alkylbenzenes e.g., dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di 2 ethylhexyl benzenes, etc. polyphenyls e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls, etc. alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulfides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof and the like. Alkylene oxide polymers and interpolymers and derivatives thereof where the terminal hydroxyl groups have been modified by esterification, etherification, etc., constitute another class of known synthetic lubricating oils that can be used. These are exemplified by the oils prepared through polymerization of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, the alkyl and aryl ethers of these polyoxyalkylene polymers e.g., methylpolyisopropylene glycol ether having an average molecular weight of about 1000, diphenyl ether of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 500 1000, diethyl ether of polypropylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 1000 1500, etc. or mono and polycarboxylic esters thereof, for example, the acetic acid esters, mixed C₃ C₈ fatty acid esters, or the C₁₃Oxo acid diester of tetraethylene glycol. Another suitable class of synthetic lubricating oils that can be used comprises the esters of dicarboxylic acids e.g., phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acids, alkenyl succinic acids, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic acid, alkyl malonic acids, alkenyl malonic acids, etc. with a variety of alcohols e.g., butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, 2 ethylhexyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoether, propylene glycol, etc. Specific examples of these esters include dibutyl adipate, di 2 ethylhexyl sebacate, di n hexyl fumarate, dioctyl sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, the 2 ethylhexyl diester of linoleic acid dimer, the complex ester formed by reacting one mole of sebacic acid with two moles of tetraethylene glycol and two moles of 2 ethylhexanoic acid and the like. Esters useful as synthetic oils also inlcude those made from C₅ to C₁₂ monocarboxylic acids and polyols and polyol ethers such as neopentyl glycol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, etc. Silicon based oils such as the polyalkyl , polyaryl , polyalkoxy , or polyaryloxy siloxane oils and silicate oils comprise another useful class of synthetic lubricants e.g., tetraethyl silicate, tetraisopropyl silicate, tetra 2 ethylhexyl silicate, tetra 4 methyl hexyl silicate, tetra p tert butyl phenyl silicate, hexyl 4 methyl 2 pentoxy disiloxane, poly methyl siloxanes, poly methylphenyl siloxanes, etc. . Other synthetic lubricating oils include liquid esters of phosphorus containing acids e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, diethyl ester of decane phosphonic acid, etc. , polymeric tetrahydrofurans and the like. Unrefined, refined and rerefined oils, either natural or synthetic as well as mixtures of two or more of any of these of the type disclosed hereinabove can be used in the concentrates of the present invention. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source without further purification treatment. For example, a shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, a petroleum oil obtained directly from primary distillation or ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process and used without further treatment would be an unrefined oil. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Many such purification techniques are known to those skilled in the art such as solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation, etc. Rerefined oils are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils applied to refined oils which have been already used in service. Such rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.
