# Sheet alignment apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for aligning a travelling sheet 20 of paper against a reference edge 23 parallel to the direction 24 of sheet travel, comprises a first roll 21 skewed towards the reference edge 23 in the direction 24 of sheet travel and a mating roll 22 on the opposite side of the sheet travel path skewed oppositely to the first roll 21 away from the reference edge 23 in the direction 24 . The coefficient of friction of the first roll 21 is higher than the coefficient of friction of the second roll 22 , so that the paper is moved into the reference edge with a controlled small resultant force. The arrangement maintains a high forward drive force on the paper while minimising the edge force tending to crumple the paper when in contact with the reference edge.
