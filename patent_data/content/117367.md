# Synthetic heat stable enterotoxin polypeptide and multimers thereof.

## Abstract
A synthetic polypeptide having at least about 10 of the immunological activity of biologic heat stable en terotoxin of E. coli. The synthetic polypeptide includes at least 14 amino acids in the sequence, from amino terminus to carboxy terminus, represented by the formula CysCys GluLeuCysCysTyr Asn ProAlaCysAla Thr GlyCysAsn Tyr wherein the amino acid in parentheses may replace the immediately preceding amino acid residue, and at least one intramolecular disulfide bond formed between the Cys res idues. The Cys residues that are not part of the intramolec ular disulfide bond can be replaced by other amino acid residues or be bonded to substituent moieties. The polypep tides can be a monomeric or multimeric material containing an intramolecular, intrapolypeptide and or an intramolec ular, interpolypeptide cystine disulfide bond.
