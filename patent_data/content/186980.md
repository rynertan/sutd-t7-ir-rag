# Pressure operated valve.

## Abstract
A pressure operated valve is arranged so that it switches over rapidly between two opposite end positions. The valve has a pressure chamber 26 closed by a diaphragm 22 . Between the diaphragm 22 and the valve member 16 , there is a snap action spring 18 which continues to hold the valve member 16 in one end position during a first phase of diaphragm movement, and at a present point snaps over to a condition where it accelerates the valve member into its opposite end position, and holds it there. A biassing spring 32 may oppose the force exerted on the diaphragm by pressure normally vacuum in the pressure chamber. The valve can be used in EGR systems.
