# Contractable closure.

## Abstract
A contractable closure member 10 for sealing an open ended container 11 comprises a top wall 13 formed of a rigid material and an elastic bottom wall 14 formed of a flexible material and having an upwardly extending continuous side wall 15 . The side wall has seal means formed integrally therewith, and this wall 15 is secured to the top wall 13 whereby the bottom wall 14 is held in spaced relationship with the top wall. A retracting lever 17 is pivotally secured in the top wall and has an engagement end 18 and a pusher end. The pusher end is arcuately displaceable against a central portion 74 of the bottom wall 14 to distend the bottom wall, whereby at least a portion of the side wall 15 will be drawn inwardly to remove sealing pressure when positioned for sealing engagement in the open ended container 11 .
