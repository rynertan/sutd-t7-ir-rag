# CHEMICAL TOILETS

## Abstract
A flushing chemical toilet 3 is adapted so as to be capable of being emptied into a waste tank 47 on a toilet servicing unit by means of a vacuum pump mounted on the unit. The servicing unit also includes toilet cleaning means for spraying the toilet 3 with an atomised liquid cleaner and refilling the cistern 27 with, for example, a solution of formaldehyde in water. A method of emptying a chemical toilet 3 is also described.
