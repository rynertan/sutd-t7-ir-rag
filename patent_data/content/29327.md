## Description
pparatus and lethod for Re 3du nq Imace and ord Data This invention is a system for printing multipage documents of mixed orthographic word and imaginal data. Prior systems for printing, copying or transmitting images and text have been functionally limited in various ways. Standard computer printers, or the printers associated with word processing systems, for instance, will accept only orthographic data in charactercoded form for printing. The versatility of these printers may be enhanced by coupling the data sources and printers by telephone lines, but imaginal data cannot be input or printed. Copiers and facsimile systems reproduce images, either locally or remotely, but do not handle charactercoded data, and typical facsimile systems are limited to low resolution uses. Several systems have been introduced recently which can copy an original image, communicate with remote locations, and reduce a hard copy, but in all cases, certain functional limitations remain. TheIBM model 6670, for instance, can electrographically produce on a separate copier respectively an image received from a built in platen and scanner, and character coded data received through telephone lines, from magnetic media, or the like. This system, however, is limited in that an image placed on the platen of one unit cannot be transmitted to another unit since this image is not first reduced to a form which can be electronically transmitted, but is simply coupled optically to the output printer. The problem in first converting the image into an electrical digital form and then using it to drive a printer or transmission line is that an unrealistically high bandwidth had been required to couple high resolution images because of the large information content. In contrast, facsimile systems have long been used to transmit images, but the data rate and resolution, and therefore the speed and image quality, have been too low for use for the kind of document printing required in the office environment. What is required is a system that can encode image information, accept character coded data, trans mit and receive both kinds of data at high speed while preserving image quality, and merge and print to pro duce a final set of collated documents. The described embodiment comprises a raster X input scanner which scans originals, converts the elect rical output into digital form, and compresses the data for storage on a disk. At the same time character coded data may be received from other office machines through telephone lines or the input of magnetic media. At this point, all the required data are available to the system computer in digital form and may be oper ated on in a variety of ways. Individual images may be cropped, reduced, and laterally repositioned. Text orthographic images may be generated in any font and type size. The results of these operations may then be merged into a bit map containing the data necessary for a full page. Finally, the result may be printed at the system raster output scanner or trans mitted to a remote site. To guarantee that high quality images are transmitted in realistic times, data comp ression, discussed below, is employed.The result is a system which can perform the following system functions a electronic mail containing a mix of quality images and character coded text, transmitted at relatively high speed, b document make ready, the electronic composition of images and text under operator control, c the automatic merging of images and text, and d electronic pre collation, a single reading in of text and images resulting in a sequenced plurality of collated output copies.This last function is equivalent to precollating copying when the input consists of only scanned images and to electronic printing when only character codes are input.

For purposes of description, the image input terminal 10 hereinafter IIT is conveniently divided into scanner section 12 for raster scanning an original document Figures 1 7 , a document handler 14 for bringing documents 8 to be scanned into registered position on platen 28 of scanner 12 Figures 8 13 , and control processing section 16 containing the various electronic components and circuits for controlling operation of scanner 12 and document handler 14, and for processing the image signals generated Figures 14 36 . Referring particularly to Figures 1 4, scanner 12 includes a frame or housing 18 consisting of base 20, side walls 21,22, front and rear walls 24,25, and top wall 26. Base 20 and walls 21,22, 25,26 cooperate to form an interior chamber or compartment 27 within which a movable scan carriage 32 is disposed.Base 20 and walls 21, 22, 24, 25, 26 of housing 18 are planar, top wall 26 including a generally rectangular transparent glass or platen 28 through which the original document 8 to be scanned is viewed. Document handler 14 normally overlays platen 28, the document handler 14 serving to bring one document at a time forward into registered position on platen 28. Following scanning of the document, the document is removed by document handler 14 to clearplaten 28 for the next document as will appear more fully herein. Where document handler 14 is not used, the document to be scanned, i.e. a book See Figure 13 is manually placed on platen 28 in registered position. Following completion of scanning, the document is manually removed. In this mode of operation, document handler 14 is swung to an out of the way position or removed. See Figure 11. Preferably where document handler 14 is removed, a suitable platen cover not shown is provided to prevent glare and permit platen 28 to be covered when not in use to protect the surface thereof from scratches, dust, etc. The portion 30 of top wall 26 between the end of platen 28 and front wall 24 is preferably beveled or sloped downwardly to provide a supporting surface facilitating scanning of bound originals such as books. Scan carriage 32 is supported for longitudinal movement in the Y direction within compartment 28 of scanner 18 by means of parallel carriage support rods 34,35. Carriage support rods 34,35 are carried in front and rear walls 24,25 of housing 18.To support carriage 32 on rods 34,35, front and rear journals or bearings 36 are provided on the sides of carriage 32, bearings 36 slidably riding on rods 34,35. To impart scanning motion to carriage 32, a drive screw 37 is threadedly engaged with carriage 32 via nut 38. Reversible drive motor 39, which is supported on base. 20 of housing 18 adjacent rear wall 25, drives screw 37 in either a clockwise scan or counter clockwise return direction to move carriage 32 longitudinally along carriage support rods 34,35. A pair of scanning or image arrays 40,41, which may for example comprise Fairchild Model 121 H CCD Chips, are supported on carriage 32 adjacent one end thereof in predetermined spaced relation such that array .40 is above and to one side of array 41. Arrays 40,41 each comprise a series i.e. 1728 of individual photosensitive elements effective when exposed to the document being scanned to generate a signal whose potential is proportional to the reflectance of the image area seen by the array element. An optical system consisting of lens 55, scan mirror 56, and and reflecting mirrors 57,58,59, co operate to form an optical path 54 through which image rays reflected from a document on platen 28 are transmitted to arrays 40,41. Lens 55 is mounted substantially centrally on carriage 32 in preset spaced opposing relation to arrays 40,41. Mirrors 56,57,58,59, which are generally rectangular in configuration, are mounted on carriage 32 in preselected angular dispositions to provide a folded optical path between platen 28 and lens 55. Mirror 59 has two facets 61,62 disposed at predetermined angles with respect to one another such that mirror 59 serves as an object beam splitter to split the projected image into two images, one for each array 40,41.During scanning, image rays reflected from the document on platen 28 pass downwardly to scan mirror 56 and from scan mirror 56 through mirrors 57,58,59 to lens 55 and arrays 40,41. To illuminate platen 28 and any document thereon, an elongated exposure lamp 65 is provided on carriage 32. Lamp 65,which extends in the direction generally perpendicular to the direction of movement of scan carriage 32, is disposed in a generally cylindrical lamp housing 66. A slit like exposure aperture 67 in lamp housing 66 extends across the width of platen 28. The interior walls 69 of lamp housing 66 are preferrably polished to reflect light from lamp 65 toward aperture 67 and platen 28. A reflector 70 is provided opposite aperture 67 to further reflect light emitted by lamp 65 onto platen 28 adjacent the image scan line. Reflector 70, which is disposed on the opposite side of optical path 54, is pivotally supported by pins 72 on carriage 32.Spring 73 biases reflector 70 in a counter clockwise direction into engagement with fixed locating stop 74 on carriage 32. The upper surface of reflector 70 is beveled at 75 and cooperates with the downwardly sloping interior portion 30 of top wall 26 on movement of carriage 32 to a home position to pivot or swing reflector 30 forwardly to the dotted line position shown in Figure 4 During operation, lens 55 and mirrors 56,57, 58,59, and exposure lamp 65 and reflector 70, move in the Y direction shown by the solid line arrow of Figures 2 and 3 from the carriage home position to the end of scan 81 to scan the document 8 on platen 28. Light from exposure lamp 65 illuminates a line like area i.e. the scan line, across the width of platen 28 in the X direction shown by the dotted line arrow of Figure 3 .As carriage 32 moves under platen 28, the line like illuminated area travels the length of platen 28. Following completion of the scan, carriage 32 returns to the home position. Referring particularly to Figures 5, 6, and 7, arrays 40,41 comprise generally rectangular chips 100, the internal photosensitive or viewing elements of which extend Jonqitudinally thereof to form a narrow viewing window 102. An adjustable array support assembly 101 is provided for each array. Each support assembly 101 includes a chip carrier 104 to which the array chip 100 is suitably attached as by means of adhesive. Carr iers 104 are in turn attached to upper and lower floating blocks 106,108 respectively as by means of screws 109. Blocks 106,108 are generally T shaped with a central generally rectangular aperture 111 over which the array is secured, with outwardly extending side pro jections 112,113. One interior face 115 of each pro jection 112,113 rests against an adjustable support 116,117. In the arrangement shown, upper block 106 is inverted relative to lower block 108 with the result that supports 116,117 for upper block 106 ride against the upper side 115 of projections 112,113 of block 106 while the supports 116,117 for lower block 108 ride against the lower surface 115 of projections 112,113 and block 108. Supports 116, 117 each comprise a thread ed member 120 bearing a contact pad 121 at one end there of for engagement with the surface 115 of the block 106,108 associated therewith. Supports 116,117 are threadedly engaged in generally U shaped upper and lower block support plates 124,126 respectively. Plates 124,126 are in turn att ached as by means of screws 127 to base members 128,130 respectively. Springs 132 bias blocks 106,108 toward and into engagement with the supports 116,117 associated therewith. See Figure 7. As will be understood, rotation of threaded members 120 of supports 116,117 displaces the block 106, 108 and array 40,41 associated therewith in a generally vertical direction to raise or lower the array relative to the optical path against the bias of spring 132. Rotation of the threaded member of support 116 or 117 only, or simultaneous rotation of the threaded members of both supports 116,117 in opposite directions, effects a rotation or turning movement of the array supporting blocks to adjust the angle of the array relative to the horizontal. To provide for adjustment of arrays 40,41 in a direction parallel to the horizontal, an adjustable support 140,142 is threadedly disposed in the upstanding end of each plate 124,126 with contact pads 121 thereof projecting into engagement with the outer end of projections 113 of upper and lower blocks 106,108.Spring 143 Seen in Figure 7 biases blocks 106,108 axially into contact with the adjustable support 140,142 associated therewith. Rotation of the threaded member 120 of support 140 or 142 displaces the block 106,108 associated therewith axially in a direction parallel to the horizontal against the bias of spring 143 to adjust the position of the array 40 or 41 relative to the optical path. Each array support assembly 101 is attached to the scan carriage frame 52 opposite lens 55 by means of a pair of externally threaded screw members 152,154 and cooperating locking screws 160. Screw members 152 and 154 are threadedly engaged in internally threaded blocks 156,158 carried on carriage frame 52. The terminal ends 151 of screw members 152,154 facing the array support assemblies 101 are hollow and internally threaded at 159 for receipt of the externally threaded locking screws 160. Spacers 161 and spring washers 162 are provided on each blocking screw 160 to position the array support assemblies in predetermined lateral position relative to the locking screws. Holes 164,165 in base members 128,130 of array support assemblies 101 permit locking screws 160 to pass therethrough into threaded engagement with screw members 152,154. A generally spherically shaped recess 170 is provided in the face of each base member 128,130 coaxial with hole 164. A vertical generally V shaped recess 171 is provided in the face of each base member 128,130 opposite hole 165. The terminal end 151 of screw member 152 is rounded off for receipt in recess 170 of base member 128,130. Screw member 154 has a vertical semi circular segment 174 rotatably disposed on the terminal end thereof for receipt in V shaped recess 171 of block members 128,130. Alignment of arrays 40,41 perpendicular to the optical path and focusing thereof is effected by selective rotation of screw members 152,154 following attachment of the array support assemblies 101 to the ends of screw members 152,154 and the carriage frame 52 by locking screws 160. Tightening of locking screws 160 draws the spherical end of screw member 152 in the spherical recess 170 and segment 174 on screw member 154 into V shaped recess 171. Simultaneous rotation of both screw members 152,154 in the same direction moves the array support assembly 101 toward or away from lens 55 to adjust the array focus. Rotation of screw member 152 only causes the array support assembly 101 to pivot or rotate about the cylindrical segment 174 on screw member 154 to adjust the angular disposition of the array support assembly 101 relative to the optical path. To shield arrays 40,41 from extraneous light, a flexible diaphragm 175 is disposed between. lens 55 and the array support. Referring now to Figures 8 10, document handler 14 includes a generally rectangular frame member 200 on which cooperating document input pinch rolls 201,202 are rotatably supported. Upper pinch rolls 201 are carried on input roll drive shaft 204 journaled in sides 205,206 of frame member 200. The lower pinch rolls 202 are supported in cantilever fashion by spring members 207 secured to the rear wall of frame member 200. Pinch rolls 201,202, which are selectively disengageable so that a document 8 to be scanned may be readily placed between them, cooperate to advance the document inserted into document feed slot 210 in cover 24 forward to a wait station whereat the document is preregistered.For this purpose, a pivotally supported registration gate 212 with cooperating pivotally supported upper chute 214 is provided. Gate 212, which includes plural spaced apart registration stop fingers 216, is supported on shaft 217 so that the fingers 216 project through openings 218 in frame member 200. Upper registration chute 214 is also arranged to be pivoted about a shaft 220 on frame member 200. When registration fingers 216 are in their operative or raised position, chute 214 is lowered to limit the thickness of a document which can be inserted in document feed slot 210. Chute 214 is biased downwardly in a counter clockwise direction about the pivot axis of shaft 220 by gravity. Upper chute 214 includes arm 222 coupled via adjustable set screw 223 to actuating member 224. Solenoid 225 is driveably connected to actuating member 224. In operation, where solenoid 225 is not actuated, spring 227 biases registration gate pivot shaft 217 so that gate 212 is raised to intercept the leading edge of the document inserted into the document feed slot 210. On a disposition of a document in document slot 210 and against the registration fingers 216, solenoid 225 is actuated to lower the registration fingers 216. At the same time input rolls 201, 202 close to advance the document sandwiched therebetween forward into the nip of document transport belt 230. It will be understood that actuating member 224 connected to the registration member pivot shaft 217 works through set screw 223 to pivot chute 214 upwardly to facilitate movement of the document therethrough. Platen transport belt 230 is supported within the frame assembly 200. Frame assembly 200 is pivotally supported at one side of platen 28 by input pinch roll drive shaft 204. The platen belt transport 230 is comprised of a single belt which is stretched about the input drive pulley 232 and the exit idler pulley 233. Both input and exit pulleys 232,233 are journaled for rotation in sides 205,206 of frame assembly 200. Internally of the belt 230 an input backup roll 235 is pivotally supported.Input backup roll 235 is rotatably arranged at one end of a frame member 236 which in turn is pivotally supported about shaft 238 secured between sides 205,206 of the frame assembly 200. A second pivotally supported frame member 240 is pivotally arranged at one end about shaft 238 and rotatably supports a registration backup roll 241 at its free end. Backup rolls 235,241 are urged against the interior of belt 230 by the weight of the parts to obtain the requisite driving force between belt 230 and the document 8 being advanced. Platen belt transport 230 advances the document 8 onto platen 28 and against platen registration edge 29 to register the document into position for scanning by scanner section 12. Referring particularly to Figure 8, registration edge 29 comprises a plate like member 250 which is comparatively thin and sufficiently flexible to conform to the beveled wall 30 adjoining the front edge of platen 28. Registration edge 29 is supported for movement in a plane parallel to beveled wall 30 to enable edge 29 to be retracted after the document has been registered. This permits the document to be removed from the platen 29 at the end of the copy cycle. Springs 252 bias the registration member 250 against the platen edge. The registration member 250 is arranged for sliding movement on the registration gate frame 254. Tension springs 255 bias registration member 250 toward a retracted position agaInst stop member 256, member 250 being slotted at 258 for receipt of stop members 256. Registration member 250 is raised to bring the registration edge 29 thereof into position to intercept the leading edge of the document by means of a solenoid 260 which is connected to member 250 by link 262. When raised to the document intercept position, the register edge 29 engages belt 230 to raise the register backup roll 241 slightly off the surface of platen 28 to create a registration pocket. This reduces the normal force of belt 230 against the document as the document is advanced toward register edge 29. After the document has been registered, solenoid 260 is engaged and register edge 29 is withdrawn to the retracted position shown in Figure 8.This permits register roll 241 to drop back into engagement with the document through the belt 230 to facilitate advance of the document from platen 28 by the belt transport 230. If a second document has been preregistered against fingers 216, the document is fed onto platen 28 simultaneously with the removal of the previous document from platen 28. The document is advanced by transport belt 230 into the nip of output roll pair 265,266. Roll 265 is supported on rotatable output roll drive shaft 268. Lower rolls 266 are idler rolls and are supported on individual shafts 269. Spring 270 biases rolls 266 into engagement with the rolls 265. Guide chutes 272,273 serve to guide the document into the nip of rolls 265,266 and through discharge opening 275 to document tray 266. To permit document 8 to be located in registered position on platen 28 manually, a document register edge 282 is provided. Referring particularly to Figures 11, 12, parallelogram type linkage 284, secured to frame 200 provides parallel sliding movement of registration plate 283. Tension springs 287 bias the parallelogram linkage 284 such that the registration edge 282 thereof is in operative position on platen 28. Cable 288 couples linkage 284 to actuating member 289 mounted on the document handler cover 24. When document handler 14 is raised, cable 288 is slack and manual registration edge 282, under the influence of springs 287, is operatively positioned on platen 28 to register a document placed thereon.When document handler 14 is closed, actuating member 289 pulls cable 288 taut to retract registration edge 282 to an out of theway position. Referring particularly to Figures 9 and 11, a drive motor 290 is connected to document handler 14 via clutch and pulley 291, timing belts 292 and 293, and intermediate pulley pair 294 as shown inFigure 11. Timing belt 293 is coupled to shaft 204 of roll 201 through pulley 296. Timing belts 297 and 298 couple shaft 904 to pulley 299 on platen transport belt drive roll 232 and pulley 300 of document discharge rolls 265. Referring to Figure 13, a pivotally supported document decelerator support bar 302 is provided in tray 266. Spring 303 biases bar 302 upwardly. Mylar strips 305 on bar 303 serve to decelerate documents exiting from document handler 14. Referring to Figure 14, control section 16 may be conveniently divided into CCD sensor board SB 300, scan electronics module SEM 302, image processing module IPM 304, video output board VOB 306, MPU controller board MPU 308 and operator control panel 309.As will appear more fully herein video image signals or pixels produced by arrays 40,41 are initially processed on SB 300 following which the analog image signals are input to IPM 304 for further processing. Processing of the image signals is regulated by clock signals derived from SEM 302 and commands from MPU 308. MPU 308 in turn, responds to instructions by the user through control panel 309. Following processing, the image signals, are output by IPM 304 to VOB 306. From VOB 306 the image signals may be further processed and or stored in memory, transmitted, or input to a suitable copy producing apparatus, the latter to provide copies of the document or documents originally scanned. IIT 10 is operable in one of several modes in accordance with the instructions of the user or operator. In addition, a DEFAULT MODE is automatically invoked whenever a system overload occurs, as for example, when compressing the image signals. The operational modes of IIT 10 comprise a LINE INPUT MODE, PICTORIAL INPUT MODE, PICTORIALENHANCEMENT MODE, and DEFAULT MODE. The LINE INPUTMODE is used to scan documents which are comprised mainly of line type graphical information. In this mode, the analog image signals are compared with a preset threshold value to provide an image signal output by IIT 10 in binary i.e. 1 bit per pixel form. Scanning is effected at a relatively high speed and image output resolution after processing is relatively high. One scanning speed is 125 mm per second mmps for both scan carriage 32 Y direction and arrays 40,41 X direction . This results in an image resolution of nine pixels per mm in the X direction by 19 lines per mm in the Y direction .Interpolators 510, 512 and Sampler 590 Figures 23, 24 cooperate to double the number of pixels in the Xdirection to 19 pixels per mm as will appearScale coefficient latch 731 Figure 25 permits drop ping of selected pixels to provide reduced size images as will appear. The PICTORIAL INPUT MODE is used for scanning documents containing predominantly continuous tone pictorial information. In this mode, scanning is conducted at a relatively low speed. One suitable scanning speed is 50 mmps for both scan carriage 32 and arrays 40,41. This results in image resolution during scanning of nine pixels per mm in the X direction by 19 lines per mm in the Y direction .As in the case of the LINE INPUT MODE, the image signals are interpolated to double the image resolution in the X direction. This results in the example given of an image output resolution of 19 pixels per mm in the X direction by 19 lines per mm in the Y direction . In this mode of operation, the analog image signals are screened electronically to provide a binary i.e. 1 bit per pixel output. The PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE is used for scanning documents containing predominantly half tone pictorial information or continuous tone pictorial information where it is desired to retain gray scale information for subsequent processing. In this mode, scanning is done at a relatively low speed in bothX and Y directions with reduced image resolution. For example, in this mode scanning may be at a rate of 50 mmps for scan carriage 32 and at the rate of 25 mmps for arrays 40,41. This results in an image resolution of nine pixels per mm in the X direction by nine lines per mm in the Y direction . The image output is quantized, coded 6 bit gray scale as will appear. The DEFAULT MODE may occur when an overload is detected on the system. In response thereto, a rescan of the document is automatically requested with interpolation omitted. Rescanning is effected at a relatively high speed, for example at 125mmps with resolution ofnine pixels per mm in the X direction by 19 lines per mm in the Y direction . The output is in l bit binary form from either thresholding or screening, depending on the operational mode selected. Referring particularly to Figures 15 and 16, the exemplary CCD type arrays 40,41 each include a succession i.e. array of photosensitive elements 311 on the narrow center portion of silicon chip 313. Elements 311 are flanked on either side by rows 315,316 of transfer gates 318. Registers 320,321, which comprise parallel input serial output analog registers, are disposed on either side of the rows 315,316 of transfer gates Transfer gates 318 switch the output of the individual photosensitive elements 311 to phase gates 322 of shift registers 320,321.The total number of transfer gates used in each row 315,316 is equal to one half the total number of photosensitive elements 311 with alternate, i.e. odd numbered photosensitive elements coupled through row 315 of transfer gates to shift register 320 and even numbered photosensitive elements coupled through row 316 of transfer gates to shift register 321. The total number of phase gates 322 in shift registers 320, 321 is equal to the number of photosensitive elements 311 that comprise each array and as a result, only alternate shift register phase gates are coupled to the photosensitive elements 311. Arrays 40,41 function to convert the graphical image of a document 8 to a series of electronic image signals or pixels.On exposure of the photosensitive elements 311 to the illuminated document over a preset time interval termed the integration period , a charge proportional to the luminous energy reflected from the document is generated.Following integration the charges on the photosensitive elements are transferred en masse to phase gates 322 of shift registers 320, 321 on enablement of transfer gates 315,316 by a transfer signal XA XB Following transfer of the charges from the charge coupled cells to alternate gates of registers 320, 321, the resulting image signals are shifted by means of clock driving pulses l l, 2 1, 1 2, 2 2 Figure 16 serially along registers 320, 321 i.e. from left to right in Figure 15 to output gate 326. There image signals and offset signals from the matching phase gates of the adjoining registers are summed and output via holding diode 328 of amplifier section 329 to emitter followers 333 Figure 17 where initial signal processing commences.Referring particularly to Figures 16, 17, image signals produced by arrays 40,41 are output along separate signal channels 330, 331 of SB 300 before being combined at crossover switch 350 Figure 17b to provide an uninterrupted stream of video image signals analog video for each line scanned. During this stage certain initial signal processing occurs. Inasmuch as the component parts of each signal channel 330, 331 are the same, only channel 330 is described in detail herein. Operating clock signals R R1 1, 1 2, 2 1, 2 2, 8 QXB GOOD DATA, SAMPLE, AGC, STITCH are derived from SEM 302. Time 0 is arbitrarily chosen as a time a particular array starts to clock out video image signals. It should be understood, however, that certain other events, principally scanning or integration, and charge transfer where the image signals are transferred from photosensitive elements 311 to shift registers 320,321 , occur in the preceding cycle, i.e. from count 3462 3473 and count 3478 3489 Figure 16b . As described earlier, the viewing fields of arrays 40,41 overlap one another to assure an uninterrupted stream of video image signals. On clocking out of the image signals from shift registers 320,321 crossover from one array i.e. 40 to another i.e. 41 is made at a preselected point within the overlapping viewing fields. The unused or excess image signals from both arrays 40,41 are discarded. All events are clocked from a master counter 406 Figure 18, 19 . With counter at zero, image signals in shift registers 320,321 of array 40 are clocked out by clock pulses B1 lr 2 1 until a count of 1732 is reached. Clock pulses i1 2, 2 2 start at count 1716.At count 1724 the stitch signal STITCH goes low to trigger crossover switch 350 and couple array 41 to output lead 351. With the crossover point selected in the example at count 1724, array 40 has 8 unused pixels 1724 1732 and array 41 has 8 unused pixels 1716 1724 .These unused pixels are discarded. Referring particularly to Figures 17a and 17b, video image signals output by the arrays are fed to emitter follower 333 which provides current gain and serves as a low impedance driver for sample and hold circuit 339. Follower 333 may for example, comprise a Texas Instruments 3904 transistor. The signal output of follower 333 passes via lead 335 and blocking capacitor 336 to sample and hold circuit 339. Capacitor 336 serves to block out the relatively large DC offset of the arrays. A predetermined bias is provided by bias circuit 337. Sample and hold circuit 339 may for example, comprise a Signetics SD 5000 circuit. Circuit 339 responds to a periodic signal SAMPLE to periodically sample and hold the video image signals for a preset time interval. The output of sample and hold circuit 339 is fed va lead 340 to the non inverting input of differential amplifier 341 which may for example, comprise a National Semiconductor LH 0032 amplifier.Amplifier 341 serves to modify the video image signal level in response to a gain signal AGC determined in accordance with the operating characteristics of each array by automatic gain control circuit 342, as will appear. The image signal output by amplifier 341 is passed via lead 343 and blocking capacitor 344 te crossover switch 350 which as described couples one or the other array 40 or 41 to output amplifier 353 in response to a stitching signal STITCH . To restore channel 331 to a zero signal level prior to the next integration, a zero level restore ZR signal is input to switch 350 following the last image signal. In the exemplary arrangement shown in Figure 16, the ZR signal is input to switch 350 from count 3447 to 3462 to complete a circuit coupling crossover switch 350 to ground. Referring particularly to Figure 18b, SEM 302 provides clock and timing signals for operating the various components of IIT 10. SEM 302 includes a clock pulse generator 400 which may for example, utilize a pair of crystals 50.31 MHz and 20.13 MHz and a flip flop divider not shown for generating base multiple frequency clock pulses corresponding to different IIT scanning rates. As will appear, IIT 10 may be operated at one of several scanning rates which, in the example described, comprise rates of 25,50andl25mmps. Selection of the IIT operating mode by the user or operator through control panel 309 determines the scanning rate. A control signal SPEED SELECT corresponding to the scanning mode selected is input by MPU 308 to clock generator 400 of SEM 302 to select the output clock signal frequency of clock generator 400. SEM 302 is coupled to MPU 308 through programmable peripheral interfaces PPI 405, which may for example, comprise IntelModel 8255A 5SR PPI s. The signal output 60R of clock pulse generator 400 is input to subolock generator 402. Subclock generator 402, which may comprise suitable flip flop based logic circuitry not shown divides the clock signals 6q input by clock pulse generator 400 into operating clock signals ÇiR, 2R, SHSMP SA2PLE COMAND respectively. Clock signals R, 2pR, and SAMPLE COMMAND are input to IPM 304 and clock signal R which is the reset signal corresponding to the pixel rate for arrays 40,41, is further input to master counter 406 of SB 300 Fig. 19 As described earlier, master counter 406 controls operational timing of arrays 40,41.Referring particularly to Figure 19, master counter 406 includes plural registers 437 responsive to clock signals R from subclock generator 402 to provide a 12 bit clock signal output to bus 407 and count decode logic 408. Bus 407 is also coupled to programmable pulse generator 416 and address circuit 421 of bad pixel RAM 420. Count decode logic 408 incorporates plural e.g. 4 6 bit to 8 bit registers with attendant NOR gate array not shown for decoding the clock signal input thereto from master counter 406 to provide a plurality of timed controlled signals to event timer 410. Event timer 410, which may comprise flip flop based logic not shown for subdividing the input pulses thereto, provides the enabling signal GOOD DATA and clock pulses 0XA, XB to IPM 304 and clock pulses 01 1, 2 1, B1 21 332 2, 0XA, 0XB and sample signal SP IPLE to SB 302 as described heretofore in connection withFigure 16. The function and purpose of programmable pulse generator 416 and bad pixel RAM 420 will appear hereinbelow. The pulse clock frequency corresponding to 50 mmps 20.13 MHz generated by clock pulse generator 400 is output via lead 409 to A D converter 501 of IPM 304 as will appear. Video image signals Analog Video from SB 300 see Figure 17 are input to IPM 304 for further processing prior to output to VOB 306 and or MPU 308. Referring particularly to Figure 20, the flow of image signals through IPM 304 is there illustrated. A selector switch 500 permits the user to select the signal input source to be coupled to Sample and Hold S H circuit 501 from either SB 300 or from IIT test calibration selector switch 502. Image signals from S H circuit 501 are input to either threshold screen processing section 505 or A D conversion section 506 depending on the setting of selector switch 504 by the operator.Where PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE is selected, switch 504 is set to route image signals to A D conversion section 506. Where LINE INPUT MODE or PICTORIAL INPUTMODE is selected, switch 504 is set to route the image signals to threshold screen processing section 505. Threshold screen processing section 505 has selector switches 508, 509 for routing the image signals to either high speed i.e.125 mmps interpolator 510 LINEINPUT MODE , or low speed i.e.50mmps interpolator 512 PICTORIAL INPUT MODE . The image signals from selector switch 509 are input to thresholder 514 where the signals may be either thrsholded or screened, depending upon the output of screen threshold circuit 516. D A converter 517 converts the digital threshold screen output of circuit 516 to analog signals for use by thresholder 514. The output of thresholder 514,which is in bitserial form, is routed either to VOB 306 or to serialparallel converter 519. From converter 519, the signal output, in 8 bit form, is input to MPU 308. Image signals routed to A D processing section 506 are input to A D converter 520 whereat the signals are converted from analog to 6 bit digital. The output of A D converter 520 is fed to selector switch 522 which routes the signals to either VOB 304 or MPU 308. To accommodate illumination vagaries and falloff of the exposure lamp, a shading compensation circuit 525 is provided. The output of circuit 525 is input via D A converter 526 to both thresholder 514 and toA D converter 520 for modifying the image data as will appear. Referring particularly to Figures 21 and 22,S H circuit 501 serves as both a low pass filter to remove noise from the image signals and to periodically sample and hold the image signal level sampled over a preset time interval. S H circuit 501 may for example, comprise a Datel SHM UH sample and hold circuit. Video image data from SB 300are input to S H circuit 501 in lead 550 via selector switch 500. Sample and hold enabling signal SHE in lead 552 inhibits a sample command SHSMP if the A D conversion by A D converter 520 is not completed when operating in the PIC TRIAL ENHANCEMENT mode. Enabling signal SHE is derived from flip flop pair 801,802 Figure 22 response to the signal EADTB representing the operational timing of A D converter 520 in the context of sample command clock signals SHSMP and DHSMP. Selection of this mode by the operator generates an enabling signal A D MODE in lead 800 to flip flop 801.The sample command SHSMP signal in lead 553 is derived from subclock generator 402 of SEM 302 Figure 18b to operate flip flop pair 801,802 and activate S H circuit 501 in timed synchronization with the input of video image signals such that each signal is sampled a predetermined distance between successive clock reset pulses. In the exemplary arrangement shown, samplers are taken at 5 6 the distance between reset pulses To correlate the sample command with the operating characteristics of S H circuit 501, the sample command SHSMP signal is input to tapped digital delay 555 which for example, may comprise a Data Delay ModelDDU 4. Digital delay 555 is set to delay the sample command signal for a preset interval to provide delayed sample command signal DSHSMP .Both sample and delayed sample command signals SHSMP, DSHSMP are AND d together in register 557 to provide a timed signal SAMPLE CO, I AND to S H circuit 501 through lead 558. The sample command clock signals DSHSMP andSHSMP drive flip flops 801,802 to provide timed generation of sample and hold enabling signal SHE . Referring particularly to Figure 23, the image signals output by S H circuit 501 are routed by selector switch 504 to lead 560 and A D converter 520 Figure 20 if PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE is selected or to lead 561 and selector switch 508 when either LINE INPUT MODE or PICTORIAL INPUT MODE is selected. Selector switch 508, in turn passes the signals to either lead 562 and high speed interpolator 510 LINE INPUT MODE or to lead 564 and low speed interpolator 512 PICTORIAL INPUT MODE in response to scan speed SPEED signal in lead 511.The scan speed signal it will be understood is dependent upon the operational MODE selected. Interpolators 510,512 each comprise analog data delay lines 566,567. A linear interpolation filter is implemented by taking equally related subpixel taps 568, 569 over two adjacent pixels and summing the output to give a continuous analog signal which is later resampled by sampler 590 Figure 24 at a frequency double the pixel clock frequency to double the number of image signals i.e. from nine to 19 pixels per mm . An enhancement filter, which in the example shown is a 3pixel enhancement filter is also included. The filter is implemented using delay lines 566,567 and differential amplifiers 570,572. Amplifiers 570,572 weigh the combined signals of taps 568, 571, representing the outside pixel sum, with the sum of the center pixel taps 569. The outputs of differential amplifiers 570, 572 are selectively coupled to thresholder 514 by selector switch 509 in response to the scan speed SPEED selected. Data delay lines 566,567 hich may for example, comprise Data Delay Devices No. 2214 4006 are identical except that delay line 567 for low speed interpolator 512 is longer than delay line 566 for high speed interpolator 519. Differential amplifiers 570, 572 may compriseRCA Model CA3100 OP A4PS. Referring particularly to Figure 24, image signals output from processing section 505 are fed to analog signal comparator 575 of thresholder 514 via lead 576. Comparator 575 which may comprise a Signetics NE 521 analog signal comparator, compares the image signals on a pixel by pixel basis with threshold screen signals provided in lead 578. Where the level of the image signal is above the level of the threshold screen signal in lead 578, a binary signal output of 1, representing a black image area, is generated in output lead 579.Where the image signal level is equal to or below that of the signal in lead 578, a binary output signal of 0 representing a white image area is generated. Threshold screen signals in lead 578 are provided by D A converter 517 in response to a 6 bit fixed threshold or screen pattern input thereto from screen threshold circuit 516 through lead 581. Referring particularly to Figure 25a, circuit 516 has screen values stored in RAM 741. The output of RAM 741 is coupled to control switch 745. Fixed threshold values are supplied by MPU 308 to threshold latch circuit 746. The output of latch 746 is coupled to control switch 745.A control signal SELECT from MPU 308 sets control switch 745 to output either screen values from RAM 741 or the fixed threshold value from threshold latch circuit 746 to lead 581 and D A converter 517 in response to the operational mode selected, i.e. PICTORIAL or LINEINPUT MODE. Bi directional communication is provided between RAM 741 and MPU 308 through tri state latch 740.During scanning, a local read enable signal is input to multiplexer 742 through lead 739. Multiplexer 742 applies a read enable signal to the r7E pin of RAM 741 and an output disable DISABLE signal to latch 740 through leads 738, 743 respectively. A second multiplexer 7 is addressed by column and row counters 748, 749 respectively driven by clock signals BR gL in synchronism with the pixel stream and scan line indexing respectively. Scan line clock signals L, LINE SYNC are derived asynchronously from the main clock decoding circuitry of SSM 302. Because of the relationship, velocity of scan carriage 32 must be kept accurate and stable. Column counter 748 addresses columns 0 7 and then self resets to effect reading of the thresholds along one scan line in blocks of 8 pixels at a time.Row counter 749 addresses the matrix rows comprising each scan line, i.e. during the first scan line the first row is addressed, during the second scan line, the second row, etc. Counter 749 repeats after each block of 8 scan lines. Where a fixed threshold is called for LINEINPUT MODE , the threshold is loaded by MPU 308 and latched. Control switch 7 45 is triggered to input the fixed threshold value output by latch circuit 746 to output lead 581. Counters 748,749 are reset to zero count and inhibited. In the MPU access mode, as for example, where new screen threshold values are to be written into RAM 741, MPU 308 sends a logic high signal through address line 714 and gate 747 to multiplexers 742,744. The signal input switches multiplexers 742,744 to selectMPU control bus 716 and MPU address bus 714 instead of the local read enable signal in lead 739 and column row counters 748,749. MPU 308 thereafter applies through control bus 716 a logic high or logic low signal to multiplexer 742 to signal via WE line 738 for MPU read or write respectively in RAM 741. The binary image signals output by comparator 575 to lead 579 are fed to sampler 590 which may comprise a flip flop where the signals are sampled at a selected clock rate XCLKM to multiply the number of image signals. A stream of binary image signals from sampler 590 is output via lead 591 to VOB 306. Sampler 590 also controls the size of the output image as will appear. Referring to Figure 26, image signals from comparator 575 are also input to video register pairs 592,593 of serial parallel converter 519 where the binary image signals are converted to parallel 8 bit image data.Image data from converter 519 are output through bus 597 to MPU 308 in response to a read signal RDVR from MPU 308. Image signals output by sample and hold circuit 501 may be routed by selector switch 504 to lead 560 and A D converter 520 when PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE is selected by the operator. Referring particularly to Figures 27 29 and 22, A D converter 520, which may comprise a TRW Model TDC lO0UA D converter, serves to convert the analog image signals into 8 bits of digital information. Where the image data is output to VOB 306, the least two significant bits are dropped to provide a 6 bit output to VOB 306. Data output to MPU 308, normally for calibration or diagnostic purposes, is in 8 bit force. Image data output to either VOB 306 or MPU 308 is selected by switch 522. Switch 522 comprisesA D register pair 595 to which the image data from A D converter 520are output.Image data from A D register pair 595 are output to VOB 306, and to MPU register pair 597. On a read signal RDDR from MPU 308, MPU register pair 597 provide single byte image data to MPU 308.Image data from video register pairs 592,593 See Figure 26 and from MPU register pair 597 are input to MPU for calibration, diagnostic, etc. purposes. Referring particularly to Figures 22, 27, and 29nA D converter 520 is enabled by a start A D conversion signal STCNN responsive to establishment of the A D time base STADTB and clocked at the low speed clock signal 2pMHz derived from output lead 409 of clock generator 400 Figure 18b . Clock driving pulses A DCLK for A D converter 520 are similarly derived from the low speed clock signal output of generator 400 in response to an A D Mode input Signal from MPU 308. Inasmuch as the operational speed of A D converter 520 is limited, only image pixels up to a predetermined maximum pixel rate e.g. mumps can be converted by A D converter 520. Where the input pixel rate is above the predetermined maximum rate, only selected pixels of each scan line may be converted. Referring to Figure 30, MPU 308 controls the sequence of events in IIT 10 in accordance with a predetermined software program. MPU 308 includes a suitableCPU chip 700 such as an Intel Model 8085 CPU chip manufactured and sold by Intel Corporation, DMA controller 702,ROM memory 704, RAM memory 706, and interrupt controller 708. Crystal oscillator 710 provides clock signals forMPU 308 and for the Y scan servo loop speed reference SPEED of SEM 302. See Figure 18a. Operating control software resides partially in ROM 704 with the remainder softloaded into RAM 706. MPU. 308 is interfaced with the various operating components that comprise IIT 10 via SEM module 302, and with IPM module 304 via IPM interface 721 through 8 bit bidirectional data bus 712, 16 bit address bus 714, and control bus 716. Suitable bus drivers 717 are provided. Interrupt controller 708 serves to permit a routine in progress to be interrupted, and to preserve the environment of the interrupted routine with return to the point of interruption. Interrupt controller 708 also permits IIT 10 to be coupled with other apparatus for example, data storage facilities, copy printer, etc. , the interrupt serving to control a DIS channel allocated for data and or command transfers between IIT 10 and such other apparatus, to verify data received, and to interrupt and perform such data unload commands, flags, etc. as may be required. A second interrupt source, real time clock RTC software module 718 includes procedures for updating a 32 bit counter 719 at each interrupt, for computing the end time of an event by adding the count of counter 719 to a user specified value, comparing theRTC counter with a user specified time, and reading counter 719. System control over IIT 10 is exercised by a software scheduler having procedures for initializing, scheduling, and transmitting various operational tasks or programs. Tasks which communicate with one another through system control tables are scheduled by calling a scheduler procedure and identifying appropriately the task to be scheduled. IIT 10 is controlled by entering commands at the operator V console or panel 309, or by commands from other associated units via a direct memory access DMA channel allocated therefor. Commands entered are interpreted and processed. Operational control programs for IIT 10 include monitoring operator panel 309, operating scanner section 12 and document handler 14, analyzing instructions received, calibration, and system initialization. Additional software programs have control procedures for individual component initialization and verification, for loading and verifying halftone screen RAM 741, for shading, for MPU initialization and self test, and for bad pixel deletion. Referring to Figure 25b, IPM interface 721 includes address decoder 724 for decoding address data input thereto through address bus 714, the output of decoder 724 being input to AND gates 726, 727 and 747.Control signals from MPU control. bus 716 are input to a second input of gates 726,727. The output of gates 726,727 regulate enablement of scale coefficient latch 731 and mode control latch 732 respectively. When triggered, the signal output of scale coefficient latch 731 sets the programmable multiplier of Binary Rate Multipliers BRM s herein 750,751 Figure 31 for the image pixel resolution and magnification selected by the user.Mode control latch 732, when triggered, provides the signal AD mode identifying the operational mode ofIIT 10. Referring particularly to Figures 20 and 31, the signal outputs of scale co efficient latch 731 controls the setting of BRM s 750,751 which in turn control both the image resolution, i.e. the number of pixels in each line and the number of lines and, therefore the image size. BRM 750, which controls the number of pixels in each scan line i.e. the X dimension has a clock signal 2 from SEM 302 corresponding to the maximum pixel rate per line input thereto. The output signal of BRM 750 XCLKM is input to sampler 590. BRiM 751, which controls the number of lines scanned i.e. the Y dimension , has line clock signals LINE SYNC , representing the maximum number of lines to be scanned, input thereto. The signal output of BRM 751 GATED LINE SYNC is input to X scan boundary control 753 Figure 35 . It will be understood that BRM s 750,751 which may for example, comprise Texas Instrument s model 7497BRM s each incorporate a programmable multiplier enabling a selected output frequency, which is a factor of the input frequency, to be obtained, depending upon the control signal input. To provide the selected output frequency, SPE s 750,751 drop selective clock cycles from the input clock frequency. To accomplish both X and Y dimension scaling, the nearest neighbor algorithm is applied. By applying an input CLK with frequency FI two a BRM, the output clock frequency 0s is given by 0s M.0 where 0 M 63 i.e. 6 bits 64 binary coded decimal. If two devices are cascaded, the output frequency is then M .0 M2.i 64 4096 To realize the output clock frequency ps, selected clock cycles of the input clock ss are dropped in a manner identical to the nearest neighbor algorithm.Figure 34 illustrates an exemplary relationship between input and output clocks for an M1 48 and M2 O. This results in an output clock frequency of gs 0.75. Applying the line sync clock to the input ofBRM 751, the output clock GATED LINE SYNC will have selected cycles deleted. Gating the binary video output with this clock will, therefore, remove selected lines according to the programmed multiplier M1 and M2. In the example shown, every fourth line is deleted. Applying a clock frequency of 2 to the Xdimension BRM 750, the output clock XCLKM will be the required clock, scaled from 2g for both X dimension interpolation and image scaling. In the example shown, every fourth pixel is deleted. Referring to Fig. 35, VOB 306 contains the image signal and line sync signal formatting functions in the form of differential pulse code modulator DPCM 754, serial to parallel binary video formatter 755, line sync signal and scan boundary control 753, and DPCM data formatting and 9 wire output interface 756. DPCM 754 serves to compress the 6 bit digital data input from A D converter 520 to 4 bits with subjectively inconspicuous error to provide a bit rate that corresponds with the speed limits of typical data storage devices. In addition, formatting the data in 4 bit nibbles simplifies transmission and further compression.The algorithm applied to accomplish DPCM is to compute a difference value d n dn Xn Xn 1 en 1 where n present video sample value n l previous video sample value e previous error in quantizing the value dn 1 and en gn dn The difference value d n is then quantized to a value qn according to a preset mapping table. An exemplary mapping table is shown in Table I. Referring thereto, mapping is effected by mapping from the value d n in the first column Difference to the corresponding value qn in the third column Quantization . The quantized difference value qn is mapped to a 4 bit nibble using the corresponding 4 bit Mn in 4th column 4 bit code . As seen in Table I, the difference values d with mag n nitudes larger than 32 are coded to the same qn values for both positive and negative values of d to use the n 4 bit codes more efficiently. Later decoding employs the equation X n qn For the values of q larger in magnitude than 32, adding the incorrect sign q to X n l will result either in a negative Xn or in a larger than scale 64 positive Mn which are both physically incorrect. In this case both the positive and negative values of q are added to Xn 1 and the value of Xn that is positive and within the range 64 is chosen as the output for Xn. Both encoding and decoding algorithms presume in itial zeros i.e. Xn 1 en 1 are initially zero for en coding and X on 1 is zero for decoding respectively. The following example illustrates the algorithms. Assume input samples are X0 10, X1 54 and X2 12Encoding do 10 0 10 q0 11 e0 1 M0 0100 d1 54 10 1 43 ql 1 47 e1 4 M1 1110 d2 12 54 4 46 q2 47 e4 l M2 1110Decoding Mo 0100 q0 11 X0 11 0 11 M1 1110 ql 47 X1 11 47 58 X1 58 positive 4 64 or X1 11 47 36 M2 1110 q2 47 X2 58 47 105X 105 is 64 or X2 58 47 11 Thresholder 514, in LINE or PICTORIAL INPUTMODES provides 1 bit pixel output.This data is formatted to 4 bit nibbles by formatter 755 which may comprise plural serial to parallel registers. Pixel clock q is input to formatter 755 and similarly divided by 4. Both the formatted image and clock signals are output to interface 756. Line Sync Signal and X Scan Boundary Control 753 serve to delay the line sync signal 757 input to control 753 to provide a Delayed Line Sync Signal 758 delayed by a period equal to all the delays encountered in the video path i.e., from filtering, sampling, thresholding DPCM, etc. in each mode of operation. The delayed line sync signal 758, which synchronizes the output with valid data, is also used to determine the scan boundary in the X dimension. This is accomplished by dropping the line sync signal 758 to logic zero at the actual end of a scan line. Scan boundary in the Y dimension is determined by SEM 302 and the output. Additionally, control 753 generates a switching signal 759 that divides the scan line output of DPCM 754 into two parts. This last function is applied only in the PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE. For this purpose, each line of DPCM data a scan line is formatted into two equal parts using first in first out FIFO buffer 760 and switch 761. The first half line is made equal to one half the scan line in number of pixels , after which the line sync signal is dropped to logic 0 for a period of time equal to a few pixels. The line sync signal is then raised back to logic 1 indicating, the start of the next half line.On dropping of the line sync signal to logic 0, the output of DPCM 754 is coupled to buffer 760 by switch 761. Buffer 760 delays the image data comprising the one half line by a period equal to the period during which the line sync signal dropped to logic zero, avoiding any loss of image data. By dividing the scan line into two equal parts, the number of bits per line is kept within the limit acceptable to the output. For example, if the maximum number of pixels line is 3440, X dimension interpolation by interpolator 510 or 512 doubles the number of pixels to 6880 pixels line. The output therefore is binary video i.e., 1 bit pixel totaling 6880 bits line. In the PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT mode, which usesDPCM 754, the number of pixels output is equal to the number of pixels scanned, i.e., 3440 per line. SinceDPCM 754 provides 4 bits pixel, the number of bits scan line output by the DPCM is 13760 bits line which is double the number for the other operational modes. By dividing the scan line into two parts in this mode PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE each line part contains the same number of bits as a scan line in the other modes LINEINPUT and PICTORIAL INPUT MODES .

In the exemplary arrangement shown, scan carriage 32 is operated at a speed of 50 mumps in the DEFAULT MODE with arrays 40,41 operated at 25mmps.Effectively, this results in arrays 40,41 scanning every other line to provide an output image resolution of 240 lines per inch by nine pixels per mm. Control over scanning operation of IIT 10 and document handler 14 is exercised by MPU 308 in accordance with instructions from the user or operator through control panel 309. Referring to Figure 18a, document handler 14 incorporates a cover interlock switch 780 for generating a document handler enabling signal when cover 24 thereof is closed. Where documents are to be manually fed, cover 24 oo document handler 14 is raised as shown in Figure 11 opening interlock switch 780 and disabling document handler 14. One or more document presence switches 782 are disposed adjacent document feed slot 210 and document handler 14 to detect insertion of a document to be fed therein. As described heretofore, documents to be fed are manually inserted into slot 210 following which document handler 14 advances the document into registered position on platen 28. In addition, one or more document jam switches not shown may be disposed at convenient places along the document path. Operating control data from MPU 308 are distributed to motor 290, solenoids 225,260, and clutch 291 of document handler 14, and to exposure lamp 65 of IIT 10 through buffer 784. Buffer 784 is loaded with control data from MPU 308 through data bus 712 such that when a document has been inserted into feed slot 210 of document handler 14, solenoid 225 is actuated to drop fingers 216, start motor 290 and engage clutch 291. Motor 290 drives rollers 201, 202 and feed belt 230 to advance the document into registered position on platen 28.Following registration of the document, scan motor 39 is energized to move scan carriage 32 and scan the document. On completion of the scanning cycle, a signal from MPU 308 actuates solenoid 260 to drop registration gate 29, start motor 290 and engage clutch 291 to operate feed belt 230 and exit rollers 265,266 to remove the document from platen 28 and into output tray 267. Referring particularly to Figures 18a and 36, an encoder 786 is provided on the output shaft of scan carriage motor 39. Encoder 786 generates quadrature, i.e. 900, out of phase signals in lead 787 reflecting rotation of motor 39 in either a forward or reverse direction. Direction detector 788 uses the 90Q phase relationship of the input signals from encoder 786 to determine the direction of rotation of motor 39 and hence the direction of movement of carriage 32, detector 788 providing either forward FOR or reverse REV control pulses to forward SCAN and reverse RETURN position counters 806,808 respectively. Forward FOR and reverse REV position counters 806,808 count down from a home position in preset increments i.e. 1000 counts per inch of travel of scan carriage 32 from a maximum count, counters 806,808 being set to the maximum count at the carriage home position. To determine carriage home position, motor 39 is energized in the reverse REV direction to move carriage 32 backwards until the carriage abuts a carriage bumper not shown . Counters 806,808 are then zeroed and set to the predetermined maximum count. As will be understood, the count on counters 806,808 reflects the position of carriage 32 which may be determined at any point during scan by subtracting the count on forward counter 806 from the count on reverse counter 808. Programmable frequency generator 790 generates a frequency signal REF which is input via lead 791 and multiplexer 793 to phase detector 792 of phase lock loop 795 for phase locked motor operation. Multiplexer 793 is controlled by signals DIRECTION from MPU 308, multiplexer 793, during scan, coupling the forward FOR control pulses of direction detector 788 together with the forward reference signal REF to phase detector 792, and during carriage return, coupling the reverse REV control pulses of detector 788 together with the reverse reference signal REF to phase detector 788.As will appear, phase detector 792 compares the frequencies of forward FOR and reverse REV control pulses with the reference signal REF input by frequency generator 790. The frequency of the reference signal REF output by generator 790 is set by control signals from MPU 308 in response to the operational mode selected by the user.Generator 790 also serves as a variable duty cycle generator for open loop driver 794 Figure 18a . Control over scan carriage motor 39 is exercised through phase locked loop section 795, the output of phase detector 792 thereof being input to adder 797 which sums the outputs of phase detector 792 in accordance with a predetermined formula. The signal output of adder 797 is input via loop filter 796 to power amplifier 798 controlling power input to motor 39. Loop filter 796 comprises a low pass active filter with predetermined gain e.g. 2.5 , filter 796 being tuned to roll off at 100 Hz to filter out transients. In operation, a signal DIRECTION from MPU 308 sets multiplexer 793 in accordance with the direction in which scan carriage 32 is to move, i.e., in the forward SCAN direction. MPU 308 loads a succession of different frequency selecting signals, into frequency generator 790. Generator 790 responds by outputting to phase comparator 792 reference signals REF at the frequencies selected. For startup purposes, the first reference signal frequency is relatively low e.g. lkHz with subsequent reference signals being increased stepwise in frequency. As the speed of scan carriage 32 approaches the operating speed desired, the frequency steps are reduced from relatively large coarse steps to relatively small fine steps. Phase detector 792 compares the frequency of the reference signal REF from frequency generator 790 with the frequency of the signal representing the speed at which scan carriage 32 moves as determined by shaft encoder 786. Where a difference exists, an error signal is generated. The error signal is input through filter amplifier 796 to power amplifier 798 to energize carriage drive motor 39. Motor 39 accelerates carriage 32 in the desired direction. The increase in the speed of carriage 32 in turn increases the frequency of the signal output by shaft encoder 786 until the frequency of the reference signal REF and the frequency of the signal from shaft encoder 786 match, at which point the error signal output by phase comparator 792 falls to zero interrupting power to motor 39. The above procedure is repeated periodically e.g.at intervals of 0.001 seconds until scan carriage 32 reaches the desired operating speed. Thus, as scan carriage 32 accelerates, MPU 308 periodically steps up the frequency of the signal output by generator 790.Phase lock loop 795 responds to energize carriage drive motor 39 and accelerate carriage 32 until the carriage has been stepped through the speed plateaux represented by each successive reference signal to the final predetermined carriage speed. It will be understood that the final carriage speed in the scan direction is dependent upon the operating mode selected as described heretofore. The return RETURN speed of scan carriage 32 is the same for all operating modes. With scan carriage 32 at desired operating speed, and the frequency of the reference signal output by frequency generator 790 constant, phase lock loop 795 serves to maintain carriage 32 at the desired operating speed. Should scan carriage 32 slow, phase detector 792 detects the change in frequency between the signal output of shaft encoder 786 and the reference signal output by generator 790 and generates an error signal energizing motor 39. As scan carriage 32 approaches the End of Scan EOS , a signal from MPU 308 closes switch 799 to short out filter amplifier 796 thereby providing a gain of zero. With gain set to zero, power to carriage motor 39 is interrupted, stopping scan carriage 32. Phase comparator 792 may comprise a otorola MC 4044 Phase Frequency Comparator which generates an output proportional to the phase or frequency difference between the encoder signal and the reference signal REF input by generator 790 while shaft encoder 787 may comprise a Model 992 500 OCLP manufactured by Disc Instruments. Counters 806,808 may comprise Intel 8253 16 bit down counters while adder 797 may comprise a 741 Differential Amplifier. Programmable frequency generator 790 preferably consists of a crystal clock and programmable counters. When it is desired to operate scan motor 39 in an open loop fashion as for example during calibration, a signal in lead 801 activates a multiplexer 800 to switch from the output of phase lock loop section 795 to the output of open loop driver 794. The speed and direction of movement is controlled by a signal fromMPU 308 via lead 803. Forward and reverse counters 806,808 permit MPU to monitor the position of scan carriage 32 as described earlier. Referring to Figure 2, a reflective calibration strip 900 of predetermined reflectivity is mounted on platen 28 on the underside thereof along the platen leading edge. Disposition of calibration strip 900 on the underside of platen 28 provides a defocused image for arrays 40,41 and reduces interference of dust, dirt, scratches and other defects that may occur on the video calibration signal generated by arrays 40,41. Preferably the reflectivity of strip 900 is chosen to provide an optical signal equivalent to a 50 percent reflective document placed on platen 28. The video calibration signals obtained from reading calibration strip 900 may be taken from either video output registers 593 of scree.n threshold section 505 Figure 26 when calibrating IIT 10 for LINE INPUT and PICTORIAL INPUT MODES, or from video output registers 596 of AD section 506 Figure 28 when calibrating IIT 10 for PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODE. It will be understood that the particular MODE calibrated is dependent upon the MODE selected by the operator. The video calibration signals are input to MPU 308 for processing. Additionally, calibration video, which may be either fixed level video from MPU 308 or video calibration signals from VOB 306, may be introduced into IIT 10 to verify operation of IPM 504. Referring particularly to Figure 20, selector switches 500,502 are preset by the user or operator to couple either MPU 308 or VOB 306 to sample and hold circuit 501 of IPM 504. The calibration video introduced into IPM 504 from eitherMPU 308 or VOB 306 is passed through digital to analog D A converter 503 to convert the video signals from digital to analog. In order to correlate the image output levels of arrays 40,41 with one another, automatic gain control AGC is provided. The amount of gain required is determined by comparing the voltage output of arrays 40,41 when reading calibration strip 900 with a desired level or .threshold value. At startup before scan is initiated, scan carriage 32 is brought to the position where arrays 40,41 are disposed below calibration strip 900. Movement of carriage 32 into position where arrays 40,41 are opposite strip 900 is effected by the operator through suitable carriage forward FOR and reverse REV controls not shown on operator control panel 309. MPU 308 responds to produce the appropriate carriage forward or reverse signal DIRECTION to open loop driver 794 Figure 18b to energize scan carriage drive motor 39 and move carriage 32 in the direction desired. With arrays 40,41 disposed below calibration strip 900, strip 900 is scanned a plurality of times in each operational mode. As will be understood from the previous description, the video signals generated by arrays 40,41 pass through amplifiers 341 in signal channels 340,341 to crossover switch 350 of SB 300 Figures 17a, 17b . From SB 300, the video signals pass to IPM 304 and either A D conversion section 506 andA D registers 596 Figure 28 , or to high speed interpolator 510 or low speed interpolator 512 Figure 20 and output registers 593 Figure 26 depending on the operational mode selected. From registers 596,593, the image signals may be input to MPU 308 in response to register read signals RDDR or RDVR. The data derived from each array 40,41 are iteratively adjusted to obtain the optimum gain value for each array for each operational mode in accordance with a suitable program. In a preferred program, the output of D A converters 912, 913 Figure 32 to amplifiers 341 of signal channels 340,341 is initially stepped up in relatively large increments i.e. in blocks of 16 until the desired signal output gain is attained.Normally however, because of the coarse nature of the steps, the signal output of the amplifier 912 or 913 associated with the array 40 or 41 whose gain is being set, will exceed the signal output gain desired. The converter 912 or 913 is then stepped down in smaller increments i.e. in blocks of 4 until the signal output gain equals or re crosses the signal output level desired. The aforedescribed process continues with smaller and smaller increments until the signal output gain of the amplifier 912 or 913 for each array 40 or 41 equals the signal output gain desired. The above process is carried out for each array 40,41 for each operational mode and the gain settings derived stored in RAM 706 Figure 30 for use during subsequent scanning operations. In a preferred arrangement, the gain is determined by monitoring the signal output of the last four photosensitive elements before crossover of array 40 and the first four photosensitive elements after crossover of array 41. It will, however, be understood that other photosensitive elements or other groups of photosensitive elements may instead be used for this purpose. Referring to Figure 18b, AGC pulse generator 415 is driven by the clock pulse output of pixel counter 406. As described, counter 406 provides clock pulses for clocking out image pixels from arrays 40,41. MPU 308 generates at the desired pixel count, an enabling signal activating pulse generator 416. The signal output pulses of generator 416 RDVR RDDR enables video output registers 593 Figure 26 or 596 Figure 28 respectively to input image data from registers 593 or 596 to MPU 308, depending upon the operational mode selected. In the example alluded to heretofore Figure 17 where crossover from array 40 to array 41 takes place at pixel count 1724, MPU 308 actuates AGC pulse generator 416 at pixel count 1720 through 1728 to transfer image pixels from the last four photosensitive elements of array 40 together with the first four photosensitive elements of array 41 to MPU 308. MPU 308 averages the block of image pixels from each array and compares the averaged signals with a predetermined signal or threshold level. A gain signal representing the difference between the calibration image pixels and the predetermined signal level is produced for each array. Referring to Figure 32, the gain signal fromMPU 308 is input to D A converters 912,913 for arrays 40,41 respectively. D A converters 912,913 convert the digital gain signal output by MPU 308 to an analog signal which is input via leads 915,916 respectively to amplifiers 341 of the signal processing channels 330,331 associated therewith Figure 17b . The gain signal serves to regulate the amplitude ratio or gain of amplifiers 341 to provide a uniform image signal level from each array. On each scan, arrays 40,41 scan across calibration strip 900 to provide updated gain control information to MPU 308 prior to scanning the document 8 on platen 28. The updated calibration signals generated by the last four photosensitive elements of array 40 and the first four photosensitive elements of array 41 are input to MPU 308 where, as described, the calibration signals from each array are averaged to provide an updated gain signal for each array 40,41. The updated gain signals are input to RAM 706 to update the existing gain signals stored therein. Since scan carriage 32 is moving relative to calibration strip 900 when updating of the gain control signals is taking place, the interval within which corrections in gain level can be made is limited. This in turn restricts the number of adjustments in gain level that can be made per array. In the exemplary 2rrangeeient shown, the interval is such that only changes in gin setting of one step can be made. However, as long as any drift or change in array performance is relatively minor, the aforedescribed updating will maintain the desired array operating level. If a substantial change in array performance takes place, several scans may be required before the desired gain level is restored. The image data obtained from scanning calibration strip 900 are also employed to compensate the video image output signals of arrays 40,41 for illumination system profile irregularities such as may be caused by cosine 4th law, profile of scanning lamp 65, vignetting, etc. Referring particularly to Figure 33, the aforesaid compensation, termed Shading herein, takes image pixels produced by scanning calibration strip 900 from A D video register 595 in blocks of predetermined size i.e. 16 and inputs the pixels to adder divider circuit 925 which provides an average pixel value representative of the pixel block. The averaged pixels or shading signals are stored in Shading RAM 926 for later use on a write signal from MPU 308. During operation, the contents of Shading REM 926 are cyclically addressed by address counter 421, which is enabled at the start of scan START LINE to sequentially address the shading signals held therein.Counter 421 is driven in synchronism with the stream of image pixels by pixel clock p. A read signal READ from MPU 308 enables RAM 926 for this purpose. The shading signals from shading RAM 926 are input to D A converter 928 Figure 24 which converts the digital shading signals to analog signals. The output of D A converter 928 is input via lead 929 toD A converter 517 of thresholder 514 shown in Figure 24 where the shading signals are, in effect,. multiplied by the analog threshold screen signals output by con verter 517, and via lead 930 to A D converter 520 shown in Figure 27 of A D section 506 where the shading signals are, in effect, multiplied by the input image signals. To accommodate differences between A D converter 520 and thresholder. 514, a proportionality constant is introduced in the shading signals output by D A converter 928. For this purpose, attenuating circuits 940,941, which comprise suitable resistor networks are disposed in leads 930,929 respectively. Attenuating circuits 940,941 serve to multiply the shading signal output by D A converter 928 by a preselected proportionality constant. Where desired, e.g. for test purposes, a source 931 of digital shading signals may be provided with manually controlled selector switch 932 for selectively coupling shading signal source 931 with D A converter 928. As can be understood, certain photosensitive elements 312 in the multitude of photosensitive elements that comprise arrays 40,41 may be or become inoperable or below par. In this situation, the image signal output by the affected photosensitive element or elements may be faulty, or have sensitivity characteristics significantly different from the image signals output by neighboring photosensitive elements. To identify and accommodate bad or faulty photosensitive elements, a bad pixel deletion control is provided. As described, SEM 302 Figure 18b supplies a control signal SAMPLE to sample and hold circuit 339 on SB 300. Referring to Figure 17b, in normal operation, one sample signal is generated for each video image signal and triggers sample and hold circuit 339 which samples and holds the video image signal input thereto for a preset time interval in output lead 340.Capacitor 345, which is coupled to output lead 340, charges each time to a voltage level corre spending to that of a sampled video image signal. The bad pixel deletion control interr upts input of the control signal SAMPLE to sample and hold circuit 339 to prevent circuit 339 from sampling the next video image signal. In this condition, the previous video image signal output by sample and hold circuit 339, which is held on capacitor 345, forms the video image signal output to differential amplifier 341. To identify bad or faulty elements, calibrating strip 900 is scanned in each of the LINE INPUT, PICTORIALINPUT, and PICTORIAL ENHANCEMENT MODES, and the image data output to MPU 308. MPU 308 compares the image signal output of each photosensitive element of arrays 40,41 with a predetermined minimum voltage level or threshold. Where the image signal is above the minimum threshold value, and hence acceptable, a binary signal e.g. 1 is loaded into bad pixel RAM 420 Figure 18b by MPU 308. Where the image signal is below the minimum threshold value and hence unacceptable, a binary signal e.g. 0 is loaded into RAM 420. In the calibration mode, MPU 308 generates a write WRITE signal enabling data to be loaded into RAM 420. During scanning operation, a read signal READ from MPU 308 enables reading of the data stored in RAM 420. Address counter 421 which is driven by pixel clock signals from pixel counter 406 and is reset at the start of scan of each line by a signal START LINE from MPU 308, sequentially addresses RAM 420 and the control data therein. The output of RAM 420 is input through lead 422 to AND gate 423. A sample signal is periodically generated by event timer 410 and input to gate 423 through lead 424. The output of gate 423 SAMPLE is input to sample and hold circuit 339 through lead 425. Where the signal input from Bad Pixel RAM 420 is high e.g. 1 , AND gate 423 is enabled and on a pixel clock signal B, gate 423 is triggered to generate a sample SAMPLE signal in lead 425 to SB 300. As de scribed, the sample SAMPLE signal triggers S H circuit 339 to sample the next video image signal. Where the signal input from Bad Pixel RAM 420 is low e.g. 0 indicating a bad photosensitive element, gate 423 remains in a blocking condition to prevent output of a sample SAMPLE signal. As a result, the previous image signal, which is retained by capacitor 345, is output. The general system functions are enabled by the system architecture shown in block diagram form in Figure 37. The Image Input Terminal IIT 950 comprises a platen on which an original image is placed, and a raster input scanner RIS which translates the image, line by line, into a series of analog voltages through the use of charge coupled devices CCD s .These analog pulses are converted into digital form and compressed using a predictor and data compressor in the electronic input module EIM 951 and then entered into the memory 955 of the processor 956.To nllrl ru ltt scan and store times, the computer data bus 971 runs at a 150 Mbit sec. rate. The dompressed image data representing up to several hundred pages can be temporarily stored on the disc memory 952. As is common in printing systems, an improved copy can be produced from a continuous tone original by halftone screening the image data prior to printing.In one version of this described embodiment, this screening process takes place in the electronic circuits of the IIT 950, where the analog voltage is converted in a thresholding process to a one bit per pixel data stream, according to a prescribed eight by eight pixel matrix. These halftone data are then operated on by a predictor and encoder to compress the data prior to transmission or storage. An eleven bit, two line, one shot predictor and a set of run length codes, both optimized for the mix of line and halftone oata produced by this system, are used in the compressor, but the system will operate satisfactorily, although less efficiently, with any y well known halftone screening and run length coding process, and with or without a predictor. Because of a limited effective bandwidth in the mass storage elements, the system must maintain a predetermined minimum compression ratio representing a compromise between image quality on one hand and practical memory performance on the other. The minimum compression ratio required for the described system is 2 1 averaged over a portion of a page, for example equivalent to 64 scan lines. This compression ratio will not be met for the most complex images, that is, those that are least compressible. In order to guarantee a 2 1 compression ratio, therefore, the general compression process is discounted under two conditions. First, the compressor may actually expand the data. A code word in this system is a minimum of four bits long, so that if too many one bit run lengths are encountered on a line, an expansion of data results. The solution to this problem is to inspect each line after compression, and to use the raw data if an actual expansion of data occurred.In this case, the raw data are flagged to indicate to the output module that it is not to be decompressed. Second, during the scanning and encoding of a complex page it may be that the compression ratio averaged over a predetermined buffer allocation is less than the guaranteed compression ratio of 2 1.In this case, every other line of raw data is dropped and the remaining raw data processed through the system in the normal way. The result is the loss of some quality for the affected page. In this case, the data is flagged to indicate to the output module that this is reduced resolution data, and that and each line is to be duplicated after decompression. If a further reduction in data volume is required, because of an additional reduction in effective memory bandwidth in case of exceptional system loads, provision is made for the input page to be rescanned with reduced resolution in both axes. In this case every other line and every other pixel bit of raw data are dropped and the remaining raw data are processed through the system in the normal way.The result is a further loss of image quality for the affected page. In this case also the data are flagged to indicate to the output module that this is reducedresolution data, but with a code which causes duplication of each pixel and each line after decompression. The above reduced resolution mode is also used for faster transmission through communication channels, when slightly reduced quality is acceptable. The use of a predictor prior to compression results i il longer run lengths and greater compression, but because a two line predictor is used, there is a great probability that any error will be propagated from line to line throughout the entire page. Since the occurrance of an error in any storage or transmission operation is probable, a prediction break is required. At the end of a predetermined number of lines, the predictor uses an all white line instead of the actual previous line in its two line predictor.The result is a slight reduction in the predictor efficiency but a guarantee that any error will not propagate through more than the predetermined number of lines. This predictor break is also flagged for the output module. Standard peripherals 957 communicate with the processor 956 and memory 955 through the bus 971. In this system the main peripheral is a floppy disk 968 memory device for storing processor 956 software. Bit maps are retrieved from storage and organized by the processor 956. Images are decom pressed as necessary and merged with orthographic material in the electronic output module EOM 953.The EOM 953 contains a depredictor and a decompressor to recreate the original video and a band buffer to supply the output to the output printer IOT 954. The processor 956 also constructs bit maps to be displayed to the operator on the bit map display 958, a CRT in this embodiment. The physical locations of the system components are shown in Figures 38 and 39. The operator panel 958 or bit map display in this embodiment is a typical CRT display, but instead of the usual keyboard for the input of information by the operator, the edges of the CRT faces are fitted with sets of light sources and sensors for detecting the presence of a pointer of any kind, typically the operator s finger. By displaying the likeness of a control panel on the CRT, and by detecting the position of a finger touching a control panel button , the system can be controlled. The image input documents are placed on the platen 970 by the operator, perhaps with the aid of the semi automatic document handler SADH 960 where they are scanned by the raster input scanner RIS 961. Character coded data are input to the system by inserting magnetic media into the magnetic media input unit 962, or coupling an alternative communications input unit 962 to remote text sources by communication lines. The communications unit may also exchange bit map image data, compressed for efficient transmission, with a remote compatible system. The input image terminal IIT which includes the RIS 961 also comprises the IIT power supplies 963 and the IIT logic boards 964 which control the RIS 961 and process the RIS output electrical signals, finally converting them into digital form. The electronic sub system ESS 965 receives the RIS 961 output, and compresses it prior to communication to a remote data sink or to storage on the disk 967. In terms of this figure, the printer is a remote terminal of the ESS 965. For the printing of a document, the ESS 965 will decompress the data prior to transmitting it to the printer. The system floppy disk 968 has three main uses. It can be used as a user input device, similar to the magnetic media input unit 962, allowing the user to input text material and it can be used to input system generation data at site installation time.The system generation and diagnostic programs are run on the processor which is part of the ESS 965. TheESS power supplies 966 provide power to the ESS 965 boards. Figure 40 schematically depicts the signal paths between modules in the twenty slot ESS card cage and the system control board SCB 969 which is located external to the card cage. Starting at the top, the first four cards comprise the processor 956, a general purpose microprogrammable computer with memory bandwidth capabilities in excess of 150 Mbits sec. Card slots 6 and 7 each contain a 1.6 Mbits of MOS memory 955. This is the storage portion of the processor virtual memory system. It can be expanded as required within the available card space.The processor has a real address limit of 16M bits. Card slot 10 optionally contains a 10M bit sec packet switched high bandwidth campus communication option, campus here being defined as a building or closely spaced group of buildings connected by a high bandwidth communication wire. Card slots 11 and 12 contain the ImaginalDisk Controller 971 IDC . The IDC 971 differs from most other disk controllers in two major aspects.First, it uses a novel Hamming error correction technique that allows real time correction of disk burst errors up to 16 bits long. This is necessary since the data is compressed on the disk and errors would seriously degrade copy quality. Second, the controller is designed to run either a single channel CDC disk 9730 80 from which 8.2 Mb s continuous data may be obtained, or a 5 channel parallel disk from which 34 b s continuous data may be obtained. Card slots 13 and 14 contain the ElectronicInput Module 951 EIM which is the primary source of imaginal data for the ESS. The EIM 951 has two primary functions. First, it provides the interface between the processor 956 and the IIT 950. This involves logic for power control, command, status, and data rcception. c onA r the EIM 951 provides for real time data compression in order to save both bandwidth and storage in the ESS system. Card slot 15 contains the User InterfaceBoard 972 UIB which is directly connected to theSystem Control Board 969 SCB . The UIB 972 has two functions. First, it is a bit map based display controller for the user interface UI . Thus, it gets video data from the processor memory 955 system and transmits these data to the UI via the SCB 969. The second function of the UIB 972 is to provide control and data channels between the processor 956 and theSCB 969. The SCB 969 is mounted external to the ESS card cage, since it must run on an independent power system, does not interface to the processor bus di rectly, and has too many connectors to fit in a standardESS card cage slot. The SCB 969 is, in fact, a small 8085 based micro computer system. It performs a number of services for the ESS such as power sequencing, power and temperature monitoring, processor boot diagnostics, UI control both for the CRT and touch panel, system floppy disk control, keyboard and cursor interface, CCITT V.35 56bus communications, RS232C low speed communications and Ras366 auto dialing interface.It also provides a general purpose, slow speed, mag media interface which may be connected to a variety of peripherals such as a card reader, cassette tape reader or floppy disk reader. Slots 16,17,18,19 and 20 contain the Electronic Output Module EOM 953 which is the primary image generating module in the ESS. Part of the EOM 953 forms the dual of the EIM 951 in that it provides the interface between the processor 956 and the IOT 954 and also provides for real time data decompression at rates of up to 100 Mb s. Beyond this, the primary function of the EOM 953 is to compose images from instructions contained in the processor data structures.The EOM 953 has many capabilities, including generate arbitrary orthographic pages from compressed fonts, decompress full or partial imaginal pages, shift and or crop imaginal images such as pictures, logos, signatures, or full imaginal pages, and compose arbitrary combinations of the above on a single page. The EOM 953 can either be run as a real time image generator or can work in parametric time, returning its data to the processor 956. The ESS package typically contains the following ESS power system 963,964 of Fig. 38,39 including power monitors, temperature monitors, and cooling fans,ESS card cage 965 with electronics as shown in Figure 40, system control board 969, system floppy disk 968, rigid disk 967 either single channel or fve channe parallel , operator interface and touch panel 959, and optional mag media 962. The arrangement of Figure 40 is flexible in many respects. IIT input image data may be fed directly onto the bus 973 in raw form, or may be compressed first. Also, if the image data were stored in raw form, it may be compressed as a background computer task while the computer is performing other functions.Two IIT portsl IIT1, 11T2, are shown, allowing the EIM to interface with two image input terminals on a time shared basis. Of course, the data is usually compressed before being put on the bus 973 to reduce the input bandwidth requirement. The EOM, similarly, may decompress data onor off line, merge image and text information into composite bit maps and output the result to two image output terminals. The low speed communication functions are handled through the User Interface Board 972 UIB and the system control board 969 SCB . The UIB 972 is one board in the ESS card cage and the SCB 969 is a board located adjacent to this card cage. Since the keyboard display has a low speed alpha numeric communication capability to the bus 973, the other low data rate 56 Kbits sec or less communications may use the same link. These would include the CCITTV.35, RS232C and RS366 telephone line communication links, the output of the floppy disk, the cursor data and system signals. The remaining comIr,u.lication link, the high data rate wire 974, connects to the bus and requires its own interface board 970 as shown. Figure 41 is a simplified block diagram showing the optional paths of data between the bus 973, the compressor 975, the input port controller 976 IPC and the IIT 950. As shown, raw data may be trsitted from the IIT 950 directly through the input port controller 976 to the bus 973 or may be compressed in the data compressor module 975 prior to being coupled to the bus 973. Also, data may be exchanged directly between the bus 973 and compressor 975 for compression. Figure 42 is a more detailed block diagram of the relationships between the processor 956, theUIB 972 the SCB 969 and the various peripheral devices.As shown, the system floppy disk 968, various power and system status monitoring, and the CCITT V.35 lines are coupled through the SCB 969 and UIB 972 to theI O bus 973. The keyboard and cursor 977, if either are used, are also attached to the SCB 969. This system, in its electronic image mail mode, allows a document set to be delivered via telephone lines 978. In operation, the operator identifies the document set and intended mail recipient by name, address or by any other identifier recognizable by the system. The processor will then do a table lookup in its memory, and transmit the phone number of the remote printer, one digit at a time, to the auto dialer 979. When the connection is made, the document set is then transmitted through they modem 980. The touch panel, display and power status 959 are connected to the SCB 969 through a separate set of lines as shown. The specific communication links are shown in Figure 43. In operation, when the central processor initiates a data transfer to a remote site, a first set of signals will be coupled from the processor through the UIB to the SCB and more specifically to the I O data bus 981 of the 8085 processor in the SCB 969. This set of signals will include the telephone number as described above. The SCB will then enable two communication functions, the data channel and the auto dial interface. The data channel comprises a ZILOG Z80 SIO part 982 which generates and formats signals for the common protocols including those shown. The data connection includes driver receiver 984, a modem 980 and an adapter 983, which are commonly supplied by the telephone line 978. This completes the low speed, 110 to 19.2 Kbit sec., RS 232 channel. The Z80 SIO chip 982 also drives a CCITTV.35 high speed, 56 K b s, channel through the second driver and receiver 985 and Data Service Unit 986, which communicates over a Digital Data Service DDS line provided by the telephone company. The EIA Electronic Industry Association driver receiver units 984,985 are standard commercial parts, examples being the TI 75188 and 75189 parts, which constitute a standard communication channel driver and receiver. The auto dial circuit comprises input and output ports on the SCB bus,. 987, 988, and the EIA drivers and receivers 989, and 990 which drive a commercially available nutod al unit 979. This unit also connects to the adapter 983 as shown so that the data and connecting signals are properly coupled to the telephone line 978. The receiving circuit is similar to the transmitter circuit as shown in Fig. 43, the telephone line 978 is coupled to an auto dial circuit and a data circuit through an adapter. The main purpose of the Electronic OutputModule EOM , shown in Figure 44, is to take information from the system disk, transform it into video and couple it out to the image output terminal IOT . The main sections of this EOM are the output port controller OPC , the decompressor and the band buffer. Generally, the output data are assembled in two band buffers 991, each capable of storing a band of output video up to 64 lines wide, bands being defined as vertical strips of the output copy, from right to left. In this system, a band represents approximately one eighth of an inch. This output data are initially stored on the disk in compressed form. Also, the various image and text portions of the final page are usually stored separately. Therefore, the main functions of the EOM are the decompression and merging of this data. The procedure is to receive data from the processor interface initially at the input channel buffers 992, couple it through the decompressor section and load one of the band buffers 991 while the other band buffer 991 is driving the IOT. Each data element a character, a line, etc. will usually occupy a portion of several bands and each band is constructed from merged data separately, so a method for segmenting input data is required. More specifically, prior to printing the data exists as a compressed and coded system of data elements or structures where each element is assigned a band number and a location within that band. Then, at print time, each band is constructed by receiving each element of that band into the EOM, decompressing it and loading it into a band buffer 991.Each stored data element is stored on disk along with the XY coordinates of its upper left hand corner, the width and height, and a pointer to font data elsewhere in memory if it is a font, to enable this merge function. The signal sequence for the input of a set of characters which appear for the first time in any particular band is initiated by an EOM request, coupled to the processor through the processor interface 993, for the first block of data parameters. This parameter block will be loaded into the input parameter buffer 994 which will control the EOI into the appropriate state to accept the data. A parameter block corprises sixteen words, each sixteen bits wide. Next, the compressed data will be coupled through the input channel buffer 992 in sixteen bit words. At this point, font and image data are subject to different signal processing procedures. With a font, it is known beforehand how many blocks of data are required to print one band of a font. This information is generated at the time the processor software font compressor is run to generate the font set. for an image, it is not known how many sixteen word blocks of data will be required to finish the band because the compression ratio for an image is a variable.Therefore, when fonts are being handled, a font in this system being defined as a data structure having sixteen blocks of data or less per band, then the data is sequentially loaded into one of the input channel buffers 992. When completely loaded, the remainder of the hardware functions, unpacking, decoding, etc., will be initiated. While the data in the first input channel buffer 992 is being unloaded, the second one is available, and may be loaded with the next block of parameters and the next character. If, instead of a font, an image is being operated on, both input channel buffers 992 are used.After an initiating block of parameters is received, data are alternatively loaded into and unloaded from both input channel buffers 992 until the image data are exhausted. In this case, there is no parameter and data look ahead as there can be with the handling of a font The output of each input channel buffer 992, in sixteen bit words, is coupled through a TTL to ECL level shifter 995 to the unpacker 996, decoder 997 and depredictor 998 where the original video is re created by reversing the original encoding process. In the original encoding process, the video was first operated on by a predictor to lengthen the average run length. The predictor in this described system uses a two line, six element predictor for fonts and a two line, eleven element predictor for image data, but any predictor can be used in this application. Next in the original encoding process, the video was encoded using a modified run length code which resulted in four , eight and twelve bit code words.Finally, these words were packed into sixteen bit data words and stored on disk. The unpacker 996, decoder 997 and depredictor 998 reverse these steps to form the original video. The output of the depredictor 998 is then buffered in the register 999 shown and converted to TTL levels in the ECL to TTL conve rter 1000. The deprediction line buffer 1001 contains enough memory to store the previous scan line so that the elements from the previous line may be used in the deprediction process. A problem arises at the beginning of a band, when the previous line may not be available. This happens when the processing of a block of data goes beyond a band boundary. In this case, the system status is saved and restored later, but the previous line of data in the depredictor is lost. To provide these data, the parameter block of data provided to the input parameter buffer 994 at the beginning of a band includes the previous line of video data. The signal flow for the saved states is from the input parameter buffer 994 through the parameter transfer logic 1002 and decompressor control 1003 to the various registers, followed by the last scan line of video. Howeer,the last line is not all immediately coupled to the depredictor 998, but is coupled in eight bit bytes as required. The input parameter buffer 994, is, therefore, not available for receiving the next set of parameters until the first line of band buffer data is completely de predicted. On subsequent lines, data stored in the deprediction line buffer 1001 are used to supply the last line of data. The above process assumes that, at the beginning of a band, the last line pf the last band is no longer in the deprediction line buffer 1001. This would be true, for instance, if the decompressor was used to process fonts between the processing of two bands of image video. Then the last line of image video would have to be replaced before the first line of the next band could be depredicted. However, if no merge of data is taking place, and the previous line remains, the next parameter block of data will contain only the state information. In this case, the operation is faster since the last line need not be transferred to the computer for temporary storage, and re transferred back to the decompressor for the next band. After a band starts, then data are coupled through the pipeline comprising the unpacker 996, decoder 997 and depredictor 998 from one of the input channel buffers 992 on a demand basis, in sixteen bit words. In the band buffer section of Figure 44 the input register 1004 receives data in four bit nibbles while the band buffers 991 have a thirty two bit word size. Further, the four bit words are bit addressable within the scan line. Therefore, the shifter maser and assembler 1005 is provided to position the beginning of each four bits of data anywhere within the thirtytwo bit band buffer word location, which results in the ultimate placing of data in any position on the scan line. Data bits are either written, or not written, into the Dand buffers 991, but the color of the data is determined by the electronic ink well 1006, the choices being black, white or no ink. Data are merged at this point. For instance, simply loading text data in either color over image data will result in the merging of these data forms on the copy. The last line data formatter 1007 couples the last line of a band back to the processor through the output channel buffer 1008 when this data must be saved for a future deprediction process a state save . The registers are implemented so that the previous states of all registers are loaded into the output channel buffer 1008 at the same time that the new states are loaded in through the input parameter buffer 994. If the band has been completed, no save is necessary, but if more data must be merged into the same band, a state save is necessary. More specifically, the band buffer 991 keeps track of the width of the data. If this width goes to zero, then the data have been completely used and no save is necessary.If save is necessary, then the output channel buffer 1008 outputs its first nine words of register data, followed by the last line of data. When the assembly of each band is complete, it is then output to theIOT. An alternative path is to couple the fully assembled video band to the processor through the bit map data formatter 1009 in sixteen bit words for future printing. This is necessary when the image process is unusually complex and takes more time than is allotted. Since the IOT printer runs at one speed, and the data merge occurs in real time, an incomplete merge would result in a broken page. When this alternate path is used, the merge process proceeds until finished, and the data are then coupled through the bit map data formatter 1009 to the processor where they are stored in compressed form. Now, the page can be printed in real time because the merging is complete and the EOM can process the entire page as if it were a single image coming from the input scanner. In this case, the printing of the first page will take longer than usual, but subsequent copies will be produced at the printers rated speed. This path is also useful for testing purposes, since it exercises the entire system, and the results can be seen on the system CRT. The ESS IOT driver receiver 1011 adjusts voltage levels between the IOT and the IOT command and status register 1012. The operation of this register is independent of the remainder of the EOM, and is used to couple commands directly between the IOT and the processor.
