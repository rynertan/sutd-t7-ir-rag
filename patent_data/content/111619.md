# Spherical gear pump.

## Abstract
A spherical gear pump comprises a housing with a first longitudinal axis 58 , a spherical seat 19, 41 an inlet 21 and outlet 23 adjacent the seat, inlet and outlet passages 25, 31 communicating with the inlet and outlet and adapted for connection to a source of liquid and a liquid load. A hemispherical gear 53 is rotatively mounted within the seat and includes a plurality of peripherically spaced radial gear teeth 79 and a drive shaft 55 for rotation about the first axis 58 . A hemispherical cam 101 is adjustably positioned within the spherical seat having an arc less than 180 , and radial cam surfaces 103 facing the spherical gear 53 . A plurality of separate symmetrical radial gear teeth 81 are pivotally mounted within and between the teeth 79 of the spherical gear 53 with each separate gear tooth having a radial top wall 87 centrifugally biased against the cam surfaces on rotation of the spherical gear and a bottom wall 85 adapted for pivotal movements within planes passing through the first axis on rotation of the separate gear teeth over the cam surfaces.
