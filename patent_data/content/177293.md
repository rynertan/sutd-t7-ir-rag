# Process for separately recovering gold and silver from solution by carbon adsorption.

## Abstract
In the recovery of gold and silver from a solution, e.g. a cyanide wash solution, containing dissolved gold and silver by carbon adsorption in a series of adsorption stages 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 , a portion of the loaded carbon is removed partway along the series, and subjected to a stripping operation 26 to recover adsorbed silver. Gold is separately recovered in a second stripping operation 30 on loaded carbon removed from the beginning of the series. Following stripping, the carbon is reactivated 28 and recycled.
