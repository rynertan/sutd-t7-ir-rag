# A SPRING RETRACTED TAPE MEASURE

## Abstract
In a spring retracted tape measure in which the tape measure is retracted into a housing 1,2 onto a spring biassed drum 3 , the ratchet is constituted by teeth 23 formed on the housing and detents 27 on flexible arms 24 on the drum which bias the detents into contact with the teeth 23 . A portion 20 of the housing is resiliently connected to the rest of the housing, and can be depressed inwardly to engage the flexible arms 24 thus disengaging the detents 27 from the teeth 23 to permit the tape to be wound in.
