# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING NON AGING COLD ROLLED STEEL SHEETS.

## Abstract
A process for producing substantially non aging cold rolled steel plate having an extremely good deep drawability, which comprises forming ingot, batchwise or continuously, from molten steel prepared by adding niobium in an amount less than is necessary for completely fixing carbon contained in extremely low carbon steel and containing, by weight, not more than 0.01 C, not more than 0.02 Si, 0.05 0.40 Mn, not more than 0.02 P, not more than 0.02 S, not more than 0.01 N, acid soluble Al in an amount 1.8 times as much as N or more, Nb in an amount of 0.10 1.00 in terms of log Nb C , the balance being Fe and unavoidable impurities, and thereaf ter hot rolling and cold rolling in a conventional manner, and subjecting the thus obtained steel plate to box annealing.
