# Sequential fuel injection system with overlapping injector actuation.

## Abstract
Multipoint electronic fuel injection system with overlap ping sequential injector actuation having a plurality of dual injector driver circuits 22 28 corresponding to an equivalent number of solenoid fuel injector pairs L1, L5 ... L4, L8 supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine, the injectors L1 L8 being partitioned into two groups L1 L4, L5 L8 with each pair having one injector from each group and by sequen tially actuating the members of one group L1 L4, and then the members of the other L5 L8 , every injector L1 ... L8 being capable to be actuated for an extended portion of an injection cycle up to one full engine revolution a bilevel select signal SEL1 ... SEL4 initiated with the actuation signal EPP is gated to each driver circuit 22 ... 28 to enable each injector of a pair for one half of the sequencing period associ ated with each driver circuit 22 ... 28 is an independent pulse generator 14 ... 20 which is additionally triggered in the sequence, the duration of the pulse width signals PW1 PW4 from the pulse generators 14 20 being dependent on instantaneous engine operating parameters at the time of actuation an inhibit feature for each pulse generator 14 ... 20 is provided during desired acceleration or starting condition to extend the pulse width signal PW1 .... PW4 for the duration of time between two actuations and provision is also made for banking the pulse width signals PW1 PW4 to the driver circuits 22 28 during conditions when the engine may flood.
