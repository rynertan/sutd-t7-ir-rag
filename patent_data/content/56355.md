# The process to control the curing reaction between a copolyester resin and an epoxide compound and a composition formed for that process.

## Abstract
A copolyester resin having modified termini is disclose, as well as the method for making and using that compound in subsequent reactions with epoxide curing compounds. The poly merization of the copolyester resin may include a compounding preparation stage for modifying the termini of the copolyester resin by reacting those and groups with an aromatic acid to alter the activation energy necessary to cure the modified copolyester resin with the epoxide compound upon mixing and heating of that mixture in a powder coating upon a substrate. The modified copolyester resin improves impact strength and leveling proper ties between 300 and 450 F, which is desirable for protection of the underlying substrate.
