# Digital communication station.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a processor controlled digital com munication device which accepts message commands from a communication system as part of a communication protocol. These command messages are stripped from the protocol and combined within the communication device to control signaling thereat. Multi bit time separated informa tion I fields are used together with a single bit signaling S field. The S field bits are compiled over several frames to become the command messages.
