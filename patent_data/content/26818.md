## Description
Process for regulating the addition of passivating agents The present invention relates to regulating the addition of passivating agents to a catalytic cracking unit. In a catalytic cracking unit, a cracking catalyst is contacted with a hydrocarbon feedstock under cracking conditions to produce cracked products. Contaminants in the feedstock, for example, nickel, vanadium and iron, become deposited on the cracking catalyst and at least partially deactivate the catalyst in such a manner that the catalyst cannot be fully reactivated by known techniques. The detrimental effects of these contaminants include increased production of hydrogen, dry gas and coke decreased activity of the cracking catalyst for converting the hydrocarbon feedstock into cracked products and decreased selectivity of the cracking catalyst for conversion of the hydrocarbon feedstock into gasoline. It is known in the art that the detrimental effects of these contaminants can be at least partially mitigated by contacting the catalyst with various treating agents, for example antimony, bismuth, manganese, tin and compounds of such treating agents convertible to the oxide form. The amount of treating agent which must be present with the cracking catalyst in the cracking zone to reduce the detrimental effects of contaminants is generally less than about 2 parts by weight antimony, bismuth, tin or manganese per 100 parts by weight cracking catalyst.The precise amount of treating agent which must be present in the cracking zone along with the cracking catalyst for optimal results is subject to variables which are difficult to monitor such as the character of the regenerated catalyst, the amount and character of the makeup catalyst which is added to the regenerated catalyst, the amount and types of contaminants such as nickel, vanadium and iron present in the hydrocarbon feedstock, the residence time of contaminants in the catalytic cracker, and the character of the particular passivating agent being utilized.Because it is economically wasteful to add either too little or too much passivating agent to the unit, it is extremely desirable to manipulate the addition of passivating agent to the unit in response to easily ascertainable factors so as to maintain an optimal level of treating agent in the catalytic cracking unit at all times. Benefits attributable to optimal levels of treating agent include increased conversion, increased catalyst selectivity to gasoline, increased catalyst life, decreased hydrogen production, and decreased coke production. Objects of the Invention It is thus an object of this invention to provide a means for control of the addition of passivating agent to a catalytic cracking unit. It is another object of this invention to provide a method for controlling the addition of passivating agent to a catalytic cracking unit so as to maintain an optimal amount of passivating agent in the catalytic cracking unit. It is another object of this invention to provide a hydrocarbon catalytic cracking process characterized by increased gasoline yield and decreased coke formation. Further objects, embodiments, advantages and features of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and the appended claims. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, the addition of a passivating agent to a catalytic cracking unit is manipulated in response to the concentrations of molecular hydrogen and methane produced as cracked products by the unit. Brief Description of the Drawings FIGURE 1 is a schematic of an apparatus suitable for practicing the present invention. FIGURE 2 is a diagram of the data of the Example described herein illustrating the X2 CH4 ratio produced by a catalytic cracker processing a specific feedstock as a function of the addition rate of passivating agent. Detailed Description of the Invention In accordance with the present invention it has been found that the concentrations of molecular hydrogen and methane produced by a catalytic cracking unit is useful in determining the proper amount of passivating agent which should be added to the catalytic cracking unit in order to obtain optimal results. Although not to be limited thereto, a preferred method of conducting a catalytic cracking process is by fluid catalytic cracking using riser outlet temperatures between about 9000 and 11000F 4820 to 5930C , preferably between 9400 and 10200F 5040 to 5490C . The invention will hereinafter be described as it relates to a fluid catalytic cracking process although those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the invention is equally applicable to other catalytic cracking processes, for example, those employing moving beds or fixed catalyst beds. With reference to FIGURE 1, the cracking occurs in the presence of a fluidized composited catalyst in a cracking zone 2 comprised of an elongated reactor tube commonly referred to as a riser. A hydrocarbon feedstock 4 is passed through a preheater which heats the feedstock to a temperature of about 3500 to 7500F 177 to 3990C , preferably between about 5500 to 6500F 2870 3430C and the heated feed is then charged to the bottom. of the riser for contact with the cracking catalyst.Generally, the riser has a length to diameter ratio of between about 20 and 40. Preferably, the length of the riser is sufficient to provide for a residence time of catalyst and feedstock of from about 1 to 4 seconds. Most any cracking catalyst can be employed in the cracking process. Some examples of cracking catalysts which can be employed for catalytic cracking include for example those obtained by admixing an inorganic oxide gel with an aluminosilicate and aluminosilicate compositions which are strongly acidic in character as a result of treatment with a fluid medium containing at least one rare earth metal cation and a hydrogen ion or an ion capable of conversion to a hydrogen ion. Other cracking catalyst compositions which can be employed in the process of this invention include crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites having a mordenite crystal structure.It is believed the present invention is applicable to any cracking process utilizing a cracking catalyst which becomes at least partially deactivated by contaminants in the feedstock and can be at least partially reactivated by contact with a treating agent, for example, zeolite containing cracking catalysts. As an integral step in a fluid catalytic cracking process, the cracking catalyst is regenerated by heating the catalyst to elevated temperatures, generally in the range of from about 8000 to about 16000F 4270 to 8710C preferably 11500 to 13500F 6210 to 7320C for a period of time ranging from about 3 to about 30 minutes in the presence of a free oxygen containing gas, such as air. This step is carried out in a catalyst regeneration zone 6 and is conducted so as to reduce the concentration of carbon on the catalyst to less than about 0.3 weight percent. At least a portion of the thus regenerated catalyst is removed from the regeneration zone via 8 and charged to the bottom of the riser fpr contact with the hydrocarbon feedstock. In the catalytic cracking operation, a contact time in the riser between catalyst and hydrocarbon feedstock of about 1 to 4 seconds and catalyst oil weight ratios of about 4 1 to about 15 1 are usually employed. Steam can be introduced into the oil inlet line to the riser and or introduced independently to the bottom of the riser so as to assist in carrying regenerated catalyst upwardly through the riser.Regenerated catalyst is introduced into the bottom of the riser at temperatures generally between about 11000 and 1350n e 5930 to 7320C .The riser system at a pressure in the range of about 5 to about 50 psig 0.35 to 3.50 kg cm2 preferably 15 to 35 psig 1.05 to 2.45 kg cm2 is normally operated with catalyst an hydrocarbon feed flowing concurrently into and upwardly into the riser at about the same flow velocity preferably avoiding any significant slippage of catalyst relative to hydrocarbon in the riser and avoiding formation of a catalyst bed in the reaction flow stream. In some systems, however, the catalyst oil ratio varies significantly from the riser inlet along the reaction flow stream. The riser temperature drops along the riser length due to vaporization of the feed, the slightly endothermic nature of the cracking reaction, and heat loss to the atmosphere. As nearly all the cracking occurs within one or two seconds, it is necessary that feed vaporization occurs nearly instantaneously upon contact of feed and regenerated catalyst at the bottom of the riser. Therefore, at the riser inlet the hot regenerated catalyst and preheated feed generally together with a mixing agent such as steam as heretofore described , nitrogen, ethane or light gas preferably other than methane or hydrogen are intimately admixed to achieve an equilibrium temperature nearly instantaneously. After the cracking reaction, the reaction mixture is transported from the riser via 10 and the catalyst is separated from the hydrocarbon product effluent in a catalyst separation zone 12. The separated catalyst is transported to the catalyst regeneration zone 6 via line 14 for regeneration in the hereinbefore described manner. The regenerated catalyst 8 is usually supplemented with fresh make up catalyst 16 before being re introduced into the riser. The cracked hydrocarbon product effluent is passed from the catalyst separation zone 12 to a product separation zone 18 via line 20 where separation of liquid products and gaseous products occurs. In the product separation zone 18 a higher boiling fraction of the liquid product comprising largely unreacted hydrocarbon feed is usually separated from the remainder of the liquid products by conventional techniques and a portion routed back for charging into the bottom of the riser and recontact with the cracking catalyst. The gaseous products, which contain hydrogen and methane as well as other gases, are withdrawn for further processing via 22. The passivating agent can be introduced into the cracking zone in a variety of ways. For example, the passivating agent can be introduced directly to the cracking zone 2 either with or without dispersal in an aqueous or non aqueous carrying agent. The passivating agent can be contacted with the catalyst in the catalyst regenerating zone 6 by means such as impregnation, dry mixing, or deposition from suitable carrying agents and introduced into the cracking zone along with the regenerated catalyst. Yet another method by which the passivating agent can be introduced into the cracking zone is by addition of makeup catalyst 16 containing a suitable percentage of passivating agent.In a preferred embodiment the passivating agent is dispersed in a suitable, non aqueous solvent, intimately admixed via line 24 with the hydrocarbon feedstock 4 and injected into the cracking zone 2 along with the hydrocarbon feedstock. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the concentrations of molecular hydrogen to methane produced by the catalytic cracking unit are monitored by suitable means, for example, a gas chromatograph located downstream of the product separation zone, and the rate at which the passivating agent is introduced into the cracking zone is adjusted in response to the monitored concentrations. As these concentrations change, the ratio between molecular hydrogen and methane produced by the catalytic cracker also normally changes. As used herein, the term ratio refers to the volume ratio, although it is to be understood that other ratios, for example, molecular ratios, concentration ratios or weight ratios can be successfully utilized in accordance with the invention.The addition rate of passivating agent to the cracking unit can be adjusted in response to a change in the H2 CH4 ratio. If the H2 CH4 ratio should increase, the rate at which passivating agent is added is increased and if the H2 CH4 ratio should decrease, the rate at which passivating agent is added to the cracking unit is decreased. The addition rate of passivating agent can be changed simply by manipulating a valve 28 on the passivating agent feedline 24. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane produced by the catalytic cracking unit is maintained constant, or within a preselected range of values by regulating the introduction of passivating agent into the cracking zone.This can be done by regulating the rate with which passivating agent is contacted with the cracking catalyst in, for example, the regeneration zone of the reactor. It is preferable to regulate the introduction of passivating agent to the cracking zone more directly, such as by controlling the flow of passivating agent being introduced directly into the cracking zone or being introduced into the cracking zone while in contact with the hydrocarbon feedstock. Generally, it is believed that the preselected range of values for the H2 CH4 ratio will be selected from within abbut 1 5 to about 3 1.In this embodiment, the passivating agent is added to the unit at a recovery rate if the observed H2 CH4 ratio climbs above the preselected range, at a maintenance rate when the observed ratio is within the preselected range, and at a low rate if the observed ratio should fall below the preselected range. Generally, for a lined out unit, or a unit operating at equilibrium, the maintenance rate will equal the rate at which passivating agent is being lost and or withdrawn from the system. The recovery. rate is a rate which is higher than the maintenance rate, and a low rate is a rate which is lower than the maintenance rate. The amount of passivating agent in the catalyst inventory decays, that is becomes less, as passivating agent is added to the system at a low rate. At a recovery rate, the amount of passivating agent in the catalyst inventory increases.It can be desirable to add passivating agent at a recovery rate when it is anticipated that the rate of contaminant introduction will increase, for example, by introducing oil feed 4 into cracking zone 2 at a higher rate or by utilizing a more heavily contaminated oil feed 4. In the practice of the preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane present in the gaseous effluent 22 from the product separation zone 18 is determined by suitable analysis of a portion 30 of the gaseous effluent 22, for example, by conventional means such as a chromatographic analyzer 26. The analyzer 26 is equipped to establish a first signal 32 representative of the concentration of molecular hydrogen in the withdrawn portion of the gaseous effluent and also a second signal 34 representative of the concentration of methane in the withdrawn portion of the gaseous effluent. Computing means 36 divide the first signal by the second signal to establish a third signal 38 representative of the ratio between the concentrations of hydrogen and methane.This third signal 38 is fed to a comparison means 40 such as a process integral controller as is known in the art which compares the third signal 38 with a set point comprised of a fourth signal 42 which is representative of a desired ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane in the gaseous cracked product 22 from the product separation zone 18 in a suitable manner such as by subtracting the third signal 38 from the fourth signal 42 and generates a fifth signal 44 responsive to the third and fourth signals which is used to manipulate a flow controller on the passivating agent feedline and thus regulate the addition of passivating agent to the catalytic cracker. The desired ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane generated as cracked products will vary among individual systems and must be determined experimentally. Generally, it is believed that the desired ratio will be between about 1 5 and 3 1. Even units first beginning cracking operations generally employ some portion of used, partially deactivated cracking catalyst.This is because that new cracking catalyst is generally too active to use on a commercial basis. Assuming that at least a portion of the catalyst inventory is used, and that the used cracking catalyst has not been treated with a passivating agent, the desired ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane in the reactor off gases can be determined in the hereinafter described manner. The amount of passivating agent needed to offset the detrimental effects of metals contamination in the catalyst inventory is estimated by quantitatively analyzing a portion of the inventory for at least nickel and vanadium content and extrapolating these findings to estimate the total weight of nickel and vanadium in the inventory. The amount of treating agent which must be contacted with the inventory in order to offset the detrimental effects of metals contamination is calculated. This amount is dependent upon the efficiency with which contact is effected between treating agent and contaminated cracking catalyst. For example, one pound of antimony elemental weight containing treating agent will effectively passivate about five pounds of nickel plus vanadium on the cracking catalyst.But contact of the antimony treating agent with the cracking catalyst in, for example, the cracking zone of the reactor, is generally only about 50 effective.Thus, about one pound of antimony must be contacted with the contaminated cracking catalyst in order to passivate two and one half pounds of combined weight nickel and vanadium on the catalyst. The amount of treating agent necessary to offset the detrimental effects of metals deposited on the cracking catalyst is added to the catalyst inventory over a period of from about 2 7 days. Over this period, the H2 CH4 ratio in the unit off gases is monitored. When this ratio is plotted against time on arithmetic coordinates, there will be observed an exponential type curve, with the rate of change of the ratio decreasing with each additional increment of time. Near the end of the 2 7 day period, the ratio should appear to be approaching an asymptotic value.At this point, it is preferable to continue addition of the passivating agent at the same rate for a similarly long additional period of time to note whether excess amounts of passivating agent impair the cracking process such as by decreasing conversion, as evidenced by increasing amounts of cycle oil being produced by the unit and or by an increasing H2 CH4 ratio. While reasonable amounts of excess antimony are not detrimental to the cracking process, it is forseen that mixtures of passivating agents or newly discovered passivating agent may be detrimental if present in excessive amounts. If the above procedure results in an exponential type curve, the desired value for the H2 CH4 ratio can be set at a value corresponding to between 50 and 100 percent, preferably between 60 and 95 percent, more preferably, between 70 and 90 percent, of the observed decrease in the H2 CH4 ratio. If desired, a preselected range of values can be selected corresponding to the upper and lower limits of the above described desired values.If the plotted H2 CH4 ratio exhibits an increase in value corresponding to the addition of more than optimal amounts of passivating agent or if conversion decreases, the supply of passivating agent should be temporarily reduced and the amount of effective passivating agent in the cracking unit allowed to decay so that the H2 CH4 ratio again exhibits the minimal value, before the desired set point is selected for the process integral controller as above described and the present invention put into operation. If the H2 CH4 ratio traces a non exponential type curve, a careful cost benefit analysis may have to be undertaken before the proper set point can be wisely selected. To select a set point for a process in which a passivating agent is currently being employed, the source of passivating agent should be disconnected or, preferably the rate at which passivating agent is being introduced into the process reduced by a value of about 50 percent, and the H2 CH4 ratio monitored in order to ascertain whether the system contains excess amounts of passivating agent. After a period of a few days, the H2 CH4 ratio should begin to increase. At this point, large amounts of passivating agent are added to the system such as by increasing the flow rate of passivating agent by about 50 percent, and the ratio at which stabilization occurs is noted.If the above procedure does not result in an increased H2 CH4 ratio and a stabilized H2 CH4 ratio, the addition rate of passivating agent can be further reduced or increased by about 50 percent values as required. By stabilization ratio is meant that ratio which appears to be within about 0.02 to about 0.2, preferably within about 0.1 units of the estimated asymptotic value of the H2 CH4 ratio. The set point is selected from about 0.0 to about 0.5, preferably, about 0.1 to about 0.3 units above the stabilization ratio. The flow controller utilized in the present invention can be conventional in nature and is preferably located on the passivating agent feedline. The passivating agent feedline is in flow communication with a source of passivating agent and a point of introduction into the catalytic cracking unit. The point at which passivating agent is introduced into the system can be, as previously indicated, in the catalyst regeneration zone or directly into the cracking zone, or between the cracking zone and the regeneration zone or preferably into the hydrocarbon feedstock line.If the passivating agent is added to the hydrocarbon feedline, the amount of passivating agent added to the hydrocarbon feed by weight will normally range from about 1 part per million to 500 parts per million, preferably from 10 to 150 parts per million based upon the elemental weight of the passivating agent and the weight of hydrocarbon feed introduced into the cracking zone. Most any passivating agent can be used in the invention such as, for example, triphenyl bismuthine, manganese nsphthenate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth trichloride, manganese nitrate, manganese benzoate, antimony lactate, antimony acetate, antimony trioxide, antimony trichloride, triphenyl antimony and mixtures of any of the above.Hydrocarbyl substituted antimony compounds are the treating agents presently preferred, especially antimony tris 0, O dihydrocarbyl phosphorodithioates . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the introduction of treating agents to the cracking zone will be increased should the ratio of molecular hydrogen to methane present in the gaseous cracked products increase above the preselected set point, or, if said ratio should fall below said preselected set point, it can be desirable to reduce the rate of flow of the treating agent, thereby reducing the introduction of treating agent to the cracking zone. The feedstocks employed in the catalytic cracking process of this invention are those conventionally utilized in catalytic cracking processes to produce gasoline and light distillate fractions from heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks and generally are those feedstocks having an average boiling point above 6000F 3160C and include such materials as gas oils, cycle oils, residual oils and the like. The cracking processes to which this invention are applicable are those generally conducted at temperatures between 8000 and about 1200n e 4270 and 6490C preferably 940 to 10200F 5040 and 5490C and at pressures within the range of subatmospheric to 3000 psig 210 kg cm2 . The following example is presented to illustrate a cracking process in which the present invention could be advantageously utilized. Example A 26,000 bbl day catalytic cracking unit charging gas oil feed was placed on a metals passivation program using a commercially available oil additive manufactured by the R. T. Vanderbilt Co. of Norwalk,Connecticut under the tradename Vanlube 622 containing about 10.9 weight percent antimony in solution in a neutral hydrocarbon oil. The catalyst employed was a commercial zeolite type catalyst. Vanlube 622 was introduced into the unit along with the oil feed. Catalyst inventory was 350 tons and makeup was about 7 tons day. System catalyst analysis was 2 Surface area 78 m2 gm Nickel 2892 ppm wt. Vanadium 8005 ppm Iron 7651ppm Coke 0.16 wt. Oil feed properties were Molar wt. 414 A.P.I.Gravity 21.2 BMCI 1 49.6 Carbon wt. 85.02 Carbon Residue 4.92 Rams Sulfur wt. 1.5 Nickel 7.4 ppm Vanadium 12.0 ppm Iron 45.0 ppm 1 Bureau of Mines Correlation Index. Vanlube 622 was charged to the unit at selected rates until theH2 CH4 volume ratio in the unit off gases appeared to stabilize. The equilibrium H2 CH4 ratios as determined by chromatographic anlaysis of unit off gases at the selected Vanlube 622 feed rates were Vanlube 622 H2 CH4 ratio of unit off gas Addition rate, Gal Hr. 0 2.73 1.3 1.65 2.8 1.50 FIGURE 2 is a graphical representation of the above data points fitted with a smooth curve. As can be noted from FIGURE 2, the H2 CH4 ratio produced by the unit at equilibrium conditions where passivating agent is added to the system at the same rate as it is being lost from the system under otherwise constant operating conditions is a function of theVanlube 622 addition rate. Furthermore, the relationship between the passivating agent feed rate and the R2 CH4 ratio follows a decreasing exponential type curve with increasing passivating agent addition rates. As can be noted from the above data and FIGURE 2, the H2 CH4 ratio underwent a decrease of about 1.23 units upon the addition of increasing amounts of passivating agent to the unit, appearing to approach an asymptotic value of about 1.5. A set point corresponding to, for example, 70 to 90 percent of the observed decrease in the H2 CH4 ratio would be between about 1.6 and 1.9. The present invention could be.advantageously employed in the above described process by selecting, for example, 1.6 as the set point representative of the desired H2 CH4 ratio in the unit off gases. Reasonable variations and modifications which will be apparent to those skilled in the art can be made in this invention without departing from the. spirit and scope thereof.
