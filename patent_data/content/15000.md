# Improved method and apparatus for detecting sewing defects on a stocking toe closer.

## Abstract
Three sets of photoelectric sensors 102, 103, 104 are arranged either in combination or solely re the path of travel of the toe section of a closed stocking 1 on a sewing machine 8a in order to detect presence of sewing defects 6 such as skip sewing, spot sewing and or foreign material inclusion. Accidental supply of stockings with sewing defects to market is well prevented in a completely automatic manner without any substantial rise in production cost.
