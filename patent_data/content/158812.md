## Description
CONTROL ROD SPIDER ASSEMBLY FOR A NUCLEAR REACTOR FUEL ASSEMBLY The present invention relates generally to nuclear reactors and, more particularly, to an improved spider assembly for supporting an array of control rods, especially water displacer rods, for vertical movement within a reactor. In most nuclear reactors the core portion comprises a large number of elongate fuel elements or rods.grouped in and supported by frameworks referred to as fuel assemblies. The fuel assemblies are generally elongate and receive support and alignment from upper and lower transversely extending core support plates. Conventional designs of these fuel assemblies include a plurality of fuel rods and hollow control rod guide thimbles held in an organized array by grids spaced along the fuel assembly length and attached to the guide thimbles. Top and bottom nozzles on opposite ends thereof are secured to the guide thimbles, thereby forming an integral fuel assembly.Generally, in most reactors, a fluid coolant, such as water, is directed upwardly through apertures in the lower core support plate and along the various fuel assemblies to receive the thermal energy therefrom. One method of controlling the reactivity within the core involves the use of neutron absorbing elements or rods, commonly referred to as control rods , which are moved into and out of the core region and generally comprise a material having a high neutron absorption cross section, such as boron carbide, tantalum, a combination of silver indium and cadmium, or the like, as well known in the art. One common arrangement utilizing control rods in conjunction with a fuel assembly is disclosed in U.S.Patent Specification No. 4,326,919 which shows the control rods supported at their upper ends from a spider assembly which, in turn, is connected to a control drive mechanism for vertically raising and lowering referred to as a stepping action the control rods within hollow guide thimbles of the fuel assembly. The spider assembly includes a plurality of radially extending vanes supported on and circumferentially spaced about a central hub. The vanes are flat metal plates, positioned on edge and with the top edge of each plate tapered inwardly and upwardly from its outer terminal end toward the central hub. Each vane has a configuration similar to that of a pennant so as to provide it with an inner end or edge long enough, in the axial direction of the hub, to permit the vane to be affixed to the hub.Cylindrical control rod connecting fingers are mounted on the vanes, some of the vanes having one connecting finger associated therewith and others two.The fingers closest to the central hub are at a higher elevation than those more distant therefrom, due to the use of the pennant shaped vanes and to mounting the vanes at different axial height locations on the central hub. The inner fingers which extend higher exist in aligning the spider assembly as it is raised up into the upper internals of the reactor. The vanes and the fingers are manufactured as separate components and then welded together to form a vane finger sub unit. The vane finger sub units are then welded to the central hub so as to form an integral unit.As can be appreciated, there are several manufacturing steps and welding operations to be performed in making this spider assembly. in addition, each of the welds must be inspected to ensure that it is a good or sound weld capable of sustaining the load of the control rods as well as the various moment forces generated during a stepping activity. Another method of controlling core reactivity is by changing the water moderator inventory of the core for the purpose of varying the neutron energy spectrum and fuel utilization moderator control system . As well known in the art, there are several ways of changing the water inventory, one of which is to plug the opposite ends of hollow guide thimbles of a fuel assembly however, a more common approach is to use water displacer rods which are inserted in the guide thimbles, thereby to displace the water therein and thus change the volume of water in the associated fuel assembly to moderate the reactivity of the fuel. Generally, the rods associated with any given fuel assembly are supported at their upper ends, in a fixed array, from a spider assembly on the top nozzle of the fuel assembly.It has been known to move water displacer rods into and out of guide thimbles like ordinary control rods but normally, once water displacer rods are inserted into guide thimbles, they remain there for a relatively long period of time, such as a year or so, and are removed only during the next refueling operation. In view of this infrequent placement and subsequent removal, spider assemblies for water displacer rods, unlike spider assemblies for regular control rods, ordinarily are not structurally designed to be moved on a more constant basis and to withstand the load and moment forces resulting from such movements or stepping actions. Recently, nuclear designers have expressed an interest in movable water displacer rods and, more particularly, in providing a spider assembly for supporting such rods for movement thereof. Especially desirable would be a spider assembly adapted to support not only water displacer rods associated with one given fuel assembly but also rods associated with adjacent fuel assemblies.Consideration was given to using a spider assembly of the type employed with regular control rods such as the one described in U.S. Patent Specification No.the structural rigidity of such an assembly was not thought to be sufficient to reliably support the larger displacer rods associated with our fuel assembly, let alone support in addition, rods of adjacent fuel assemblies. It is the principal object of the invention to provide an improved spider assembly suitable for simultaneously supporting movable control rods of the displacer as well as regular type in a fuel assembly having the spider assembly associated therewith, and in fuel assemblies adjacent thereto. The invention accordingly resides in a spider assembly for supporting control rods for vertical movement thereof in a nuclear reactor having a plurality of fuel assemblies disposed therein in closely spaced relationship with respect to each other, said spider assembly including a hub having thereon radial vanes with fingers for connection to the control rods, characterized in that said radial vanes comprise a group of straight vanes having some of said fingers disposed thereon, and a group of T bar vanes including T bars which have the remaining fingers disposed thereon, the arrangement being such that the straight vanes have the fingers thereon located for connection to control rods in one fuel assembly having the spider assembly associated therewith, and the T bar vanes have some of the fingers thereon located for connection to other control rods in said one fuel assembly and have the remaining fingers thereon located for connection to control rods in fuel assemblies adjacent to said one fuel assembly. Preferably, in order to maximize the structural strength and rigidity of the assembly, each of the straight and T bar vanes, together with the respective fingers thereon, is of a monolithic one piece construction forming a jointless sub unit secured to the hub. The currently preferred manner of manufacturing T bar vanes of monolithic construction is by casting, whereas the straight vanes lend themselves both to casting and to being formed, such as swaged, from a suitable piece of stock, the latter method being preferred because of the lower cost and time factor involved. Preferably, the vanes of each group, i.e. the straight vanes of one group and the T bar vanes of the other group, are spaced apart 90 degrees, and the straight vanes and the T bar vanes are circumferentially spaced about the hub in alternating sequence with respect to one another. In order to maximize the ability of the spider assembly to withstand the moment forces generated during stepping actions, each of the straight and T bar vanes preferably is of substantially constant axial height rather than pennant shaped, and all of the vanes are mounted on the central hub at substantially the same axial height location which latter feature also simplifies the fabrication of the spider assembly while still enabling the inner fingers on the vanes to be extended beyond and above the outer fingers for the purpose of facilitating the alignment of the spider assembly with the upper internals of the reactor. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an elevational, partly sectional view showing closely spaced fuel assemblies in vertically foreshortened form and with parts broken away for clarity, together with a portion of an upper core support plate and with the spider assembly embodying the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged top plan view of the spider assembly Figure 3 is a sectional view of the spider assembly, as taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2, and with the water displacer rods shown in vertically foreshortened outline form and Figure 4 is an enlarged, exploded view of one of the T bar vane sub units and of a portion of the central hub of the spider assembly. In the following description, like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and terms such as forward , rearward , left , right , upwardly , downwardly and the like are words used of convenience not to be construed as limiting terms. Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Figure l, there is shown an overall combination interface of fuel assemblies the middle one being generally designed with numeral 10 and the others, shown in phase form, being indicated at IOA and lOB , an upper core support plate 12 disposed above and extending across the tops of the fuel assemblies and a spider assembly 14 embodying the invention and generally designated by the numeral 14. The fuel assemblies 10, 10A and lOB are identical. Describing the assembly 10 as representative of all, it basically comprises a lower end structure or bottom nozzle 16 for supporting the assembly on the lower core plate not shown in the core region of a reactor a number of guide tubes or thimbles 18 projecting longitudinally upward from the bottom nozzle 16 a plurality of transverse grids 20 axially spaced along the guide thimbles 18 an organized array of elongate fuel rods 22 transversely spaced and supported by the grids 20 an instrument tube 24 located in the center of the assembly and an upper end structure or top nozzle 26 attached to the upper ends of the guide thimbles 18 to form therewith an integral assembly capable of being conventionally handled without damaging the assembly components.The fuel assemblies, such as assembly 10, do not form part of the invention propeor and, therefore need not be described herein in greater detail. The upper core support plate 12, being conven tonal, extends across the top of the fuel assembly 10 as well as across the top of other fuel assemblies, such as 10A, IOB. arranged within the core. The core plate 12 has a multiplicity of flow openings or passages 28 only one of which is shown in Figure 1 which allow coolant to pass upwardly through the core. At least some of these openings or passages are axially aligned with guide thimbles 18 so as to enable water displacer rods 30 to be inserted down through the core plate passage and into the respective guide thimbles of the fuel assemblies 10, 10A and lOB. Connected to the upper ends of the displacer rods 30 is the spider assembly 14 which supports the rods for vertical movement within the guide thimbles 18 effected by means of a conventional drive mechanism not shown . It should be noted that although the spider assembly is shown in Figure 1 as disposed above the core plate 12 upon which it will rest when the displacer rods 30 are fully inserted in the guide thimbles 18, there are other arrangements with which the spider assembly 14 embodying the invention could be used and in which it would be located between the bottom of the core plate and the top of the fuel assembly. Referring now to Figures 2, 3 and 4 of the drawings, the spider assembly 14 basically comprises a central hub 32, a first group of vanes 34 radially extending outwardly from the hub 32 and including fingers 36 for connection to displacer rods, and a second group of vanes 38 which extend radially outward from the hub and haveT bars 40 with fingers 42 for connection to displacer rods.The fingers 36 on the first group of vanes 34 hereinafter referred to as straight vanes and the fingers 42 on the second group of vanes 38 hereinafter referred to as T bar vanes are substantially identical. As seen best fromFigure 2, the fingers 36 of the straight vanes 34 are for connection to displacer rods associated with the fuel assembly 10, whereas some of the fingers 42 of the T bar vanes 38 are for connection to displacer rods associated with fuel assembly 10 whilst others of the fingers 42 are for connection with displacer rods associated with adjacent fuel assemblies l0A, lOB, lOC and lOD. The central hub 32 is preferably in the form of an elongate cylindrical tube having an upper neck portion 44 Figure 3 which is internally threaded for connection thereof to the drive mechanism not shown utilized in the reactor for raising and lowering the spider assembly together with the displacer rods connected thereto. The hollow hub 32 is adapted to accommodate therein a conventional load absorbing mechanism not shown which comprises a coil spring held in a state of partial compression between the upper and lower ends of the hub, and serves to prevent shock loading as the spider assembly 14 is lowered onto the core plate. The tubular hub 32 has formed therein a plurality of elongate indentations or slots 46 spaced circumferentially about the hub and extending axially thereof.Preferably, the slots 46 are all at the same axial height location and they do not extend completely through the wall of the tubular hub but communicate with the interior space of the latter each through a small hole 48. As seen from Figure 2, in the preferred embodi xent there are four straight vanes 34 and four T bar vanes 38 spaced circumferentially about the hub 32 in alternating sequence, the straight vanes 34 being angularly spaced substantially ninety degrees apart, and the T bar vanes 38 being angularly spaced substantially ninety degrees apart. The T bar vanes 38 are longer in the radial dimension than the straight vanes 34 so that the T bar vanes extend beyond the outer boundaries of the fuel assembly 10 associated with the spider assembly, and into overlying relationship with fuel assemblies 1OA, lOB, lOC and lOD adjacent thereto. The straight vanes 34 overlie only the fuel assembly 10. Each T bar vane 38 has two T bars 40, namely, an outer T bar positioned at the distal end of the vane, and an inner T bar spaced between the outer T bar and the hub 32. The outer T bar of each T bar vane 38 overlies an adjacent fuel assembly while the inner T bar overlies the central fuel assembly i.e. the fuel assembly 10 associated with the spider assembly.Preferably the T bars 40 of eachT bar vane 38 extend parallel to one another and perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal or radial axis of the T bar vane. Likewise as seen from Figure 2, each straight vane 34 has two fingers 36, one of which the outer finger is located at the outer or distal end of the vane, and the other of which the inner finger is located between the outer finger and the hub 32. The vane portion between the outer and inner fingers and between the inner finger and the hub is in the form of a flat linear bar, whereas each finger is in the form of an elongate cylinder with its upper end dome shaped. Preferably, the diameter of each finger 36 is greater than the transverse thickness of the vane portion between the inner and outer fingers, and the longitudinal axis of the inner and outer fingers 36 are parallel with respect to one another as well as to the longitudinal axis of the hub 32, the longitudinal axes of the inner and outer fingers of each vane lying in the same plane as the longitudinal axis of the hub.As seen fromFigure 3, the vane portion between the inner and outer fingers of each straight vane 34 is rectangular as is the vane portion between the inner finger and the hub except that it includes upper and lower tabs 52 and 54 respectively, formed thereon adjacent the inner end thereof. The rectangular vane portions of each vane rigidly interconnect the fingers thereof so as to maintain them securely in proper relationship with respect to one another and to the hub. It will be noted from Figures 3 and 4 that the inner fingers project axially above the upper edges of the respective vanes to a greater height than the outer fingers. This feature facilitates a proper alignment of the spider assembly 14 with the upper internals of the reactor. Referring again to Figure 2, each of the twoT bars 40 of each T bar vane 38 has two fingers 42 which are on the terminal ends of the respective T bar. Except for the provision and disposition of the T bars 40, theT bar vanes 38 are similar to the straight vanes 34 insofar as their fingers 42 are as elongate cylinders with parallel axes the T bars and the radial vane portions are linear and of rectangular shape there are upper and lower tabs 52 and 54 on the inner ends of each vane 38 and the fingers 42 on the inner T bars 40 extend axially to a height greater than the axial height of the fingers 42 on the outer T bars. The overall relationship is such that the fingers 42 on the inner T bars 40 are at the same axial height or level as inner fingers 36 of the straight vanes 34. In order to maximize structural rigidity and also to reduce manufacturing costs, each of the straight vanes 34 together with its fingers 36, and each of the T bar vanes 38 together with its T bars 40 and fingers 42, is formed as a sub unit of monolithic, jointless one piece construction. The preferred method of thus manufacturing the T bar vanes or sub units 38 is by casting, whereas the preferred method of manufacturing the straight vanes or sub units 34 is by machining, e.g. swaging, a bar stock to conform to the desired configurations shown, although the straight vanes or sub units can also be formed by casting, if desired. It is believed that such a monolithic onepiece construction is superior in strength, and in its ability to withstand moment forces such as result from stepping actions, to a composite construction formed from individual components welded together. As best seen from Figure 4, each of the sub units 34 and 38 has an integral extension 50 formed on the inner end thereof, which extension 50 is dimensioned to fit tightly into the associated slot 46 of the hub 32 so that, when inserted therein, the sub unit will be firmly and properly positioned on the hub and ready to be joined thereto in a suitable manner, e.g. by brazing. As mentioned earlier, the slots 46 do not extend completely through the wall of the tubular hub, so as not to unnecessarily weaken, but there are the small holes 48 which will enable the gases generated during brazing to escape into and through the hollow of the hub 32.
