# Thermoplastic composition and process.

## Abstract
A composition comprising an intimate thermoplastic admixture of at least two structurally dissimilar organic polymers, a delamination inhibiting effective amount of the first organic polymer covalent bond graft linked to the second organic polymer through a multifunctional graft linking agent of the insertion, electron deficient type the new admixtures are useful for the usual applications associated with the admixture properties.
