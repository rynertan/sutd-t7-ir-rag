# Packing for eye make up and a method of producing the packing.

## Abstract
Packing for eye make up and a method of producing the packing which method exists of producing the packing by means of the deep drawing technique. With the aid of a pat tern a large number of the model of the boxes 1 are formed in a sheet of deep drawing plastics film 2 , whereupon the bottom face of the deep drawn film 2 is fastened on a strong base 7 for example cardboard. The eye make up ma terial can be disposed before or after the boxes are cut out of the deep drawn film 2 , in one or more recesses 3 form ed in the deep drawing plastics film 2 . Also in the deep drawn film 2 additional recesses 4 can be formed at the time the boxes are formed, which recesses can be used for a spatula of stick 6 to put the make up on a persons face. Al so a recess can be formed in which can be fastened by means of glue a small mirror.

## Description
Packing for eye make up and a method of producina the packing.The invention relates to a method of producinq a packing for products such as eye make up and to a box or packina for eve make up.Products, suc as eye make up, which are marketed in a plurality of Co lours are known. These eye make up products are knawn as eve shadow or kohl and consist of mixtures of powders which may also contain a binder and are usually compressed in reshaped trays of metal or plastics material. After being filled with compressed eye make up powder, these preshaped trays are then fastened, for example clamped or valued, in the actual packing consisting of a more or less decorative box or starlish packing.The object of the invention is a packina for eye make un, such as eye shadow or kohl, which is very inexpensive to produce hut is nevertheless extremely attractive in appearance.This aim of the invention is achieved by means of a method of nroducina the packing by which a large number of moulds are formed bv the deer drawing technique, with the aid of a pattern, from a sheet of deepdrawing plastics film, these moulds correspondina to the mode of a box of the desired shape, whereupon the bottom face of the deepdrawn film is fastened on a strong base, for example strong cardboard, and thereupon the boxes are for example stamped or cut out to the desired size from the resulting plate consisting of the strong base with the deep drawn film affixed to it. By this method it is possible to Droduce a strong packing of the desired shape very simply and inexoensivelv. The mothod preferably consist in that after the deepdrawn film has been fastened on the strong base, the eye make up product is disnosed of fastened in the position intended for it, for example in a recess, and that the boxes are only then stamped out to the desired size from the plate. This means that a large number of boxes, which will then consist of the deep drawn plastics film can very quickly be filled with the eye make up product, since all the boxes are still lyina fixed to one another and all can have exactly the same spacina in the plastics film.The eye make up product can be introduced into the nackina extremely simply and inexpensively if it is first brouaht into liquid form, for example by mixing it with or dissolving it in a licuid such as water, alcohol, or the like, thereupon pouring the mixture of solution into the desired places, and then waiting for the mixture of solution to set, for example through the evaporation or elimination of the liquid in some other way, or at least waitincr for a part of it to be eliminated.During the deep drawing additional recesses, such as grooves, mav be formed, which can be used for example for a spatula or applicator in the simplest form a stick provided with a tip of foam plastics material, a sort of small powder stick.Also another additional recess may be formed in which a small mirror can be fastened for example glued.Near its lower face the box may also in a very simple manner be srovi ded with a small mirror, the mirror side facing the packing, and the mirror being fastened with the aid of adhesive tape, for example, to one side of the box, so that it can pivot. After the boxes have been fil led with eye make up powder and optionally with a powder anclicator, a mirror or other accessories, the whole arranaeeent can be inserted into a casing, for example a transparent casina of a plastics material.The invention will be forther explained with reference to the drawinas, in which Figure 1 shows a part of a deep drawn sheet of plastics film provided with the box moulds according to the invention.Figure 2 is a cross section of a box according to the invention.Figure 3 is a cross section through the box shown in figure 2, taken in a direction at right angles to the latter.Figure 1 shows the rear side of the box moulds 1, as these are deendrawn in a sheet of plastics film 2.The box moulds themselves are pressed downwards, while the recesses 3, 4 serving to receive the eye make up powder 5 and spatula of powder stick 6 lie higher in the sheet.In another embodiment of the box according to the invention an additional recess serves to receive a small mirror which can be fastened in it. All forms of boxes are preferably regularly snaced apart this facilitates the filling of the resulting trays with eve make up powder.Figures 2 and 3 show the boxes after they have been stuck or otherwise fastened on a strong base 7, such as a strong sheet of cardboard or a sheet of plastics material of the like, stamped out, and thereupon inserted into a casing 8.A box produced in accordance with one of the methods of the invention is particularly strong and is therefore very suitable for receiving eye make up powder, which may be a compressed tablet or, in accordance with the invention, a tablet formed by first dissolving the eve make un powder and then allowing it to dry. A tablet of eye make us powder is in fact usually very brittle and could therefore very easilv become detached from the packet after being partly broken.
