# Apparatus for recording audio and video signals.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording audio and video signals comprises a signal processing circuit 14,20 for producing a processed video signal and a frequency modulated audio signal obtained by frequency modulating a predetermined carrier in response to an input audio signal, a magnetic recording device 16,17,18a,18b for recording both said frequency modulated audio signal and said processed video signal in oblique tracks arranged successively an a magentic tape using a first recording mode wherein the oblique tracks are formed with spaces between each adjacent two thereof or a second recording mode wherein the oblique tracks are formed to be immediately adjacent to each other, and modulation control means 13,15 for controlling the fre quency modulation carried out by the signal processing circuit 14,20 to produce the frequency modulated audio signal, so that the frequency modulated audio signal is obtained by frequency modulation with a first modulation index in the first recording mode and with a second modulation index larger than the first modulation index in the second recording mode.
