# METHOD FOR REGENERATING A DENITRATION CATALYST

## Abstract
A method for recovering a denitrating catalyst which is characterized by washing, with an aqueous oxalic acid so lution, the used tungsten titania or the tungsten titania van adium denitrating catalyst which dust components have adhered to or have accumulated on and in which an SOâ‚‚ oxidizing power has thus risen supportingly impregnating the catalyst with a tungsten compound and drying and cal cining the thus treated catalyst.
