# SINGLE NEEDLE ALTERNATING BLOOD FLOW SYSTEM

## Abstract
A two pump single needle hemodialysis system is provided in which a flexible blood accumulator bag is located between the dialyzer and the second, venous blood pump. The accumulator bag is filled as the first, arterial blood pump is operated. Blood is pumped through the dialyzer and into the bag until the bag is full and taut. At this time, a rise in pressure is detected and the venous blood pump is activated to withdraw blood from the accumulator bag. The use of the accumulator bag assures that low blood pressures are maintained in the system.
