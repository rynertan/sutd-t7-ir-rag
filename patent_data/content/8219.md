# Charge transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
Charge transfer apparatus is described which inclu des a semiconductor substrate 13 of one conductivity ty pe provided with a mobile charge source 35 in the form of a region of opposite conductivity type. A reference vol tage is applied to a first electrode 36 overlying a first re gion of the substrate. A signal voltage is applied to a se cond electrode 37 overlying a second region of the sub strate. Two identical clock signals are then applied respec tively to third and fourth electrodes 30 and 26 overlying the substrate. One of these clock signals is differentiated by a CR network to provide a voltage V
