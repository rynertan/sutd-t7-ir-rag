# Reactor temperature control systems and methods.

## Abstract
A temperature control system controls the temperature of an olefin oxidation reactor 10 by measuring various parameters in the reactor and in flow lines 14, 46 to and from the reactor, and using these parameters with known quantities for specific heat of the feed and effluent and heats of vaporization and reaction, to calculate a coolant flow rate set point. Parameters relating to the heat balance with regard to a desired olefin oxide product and undesired carbon dioxide products are utilized for correct control. Equipment is also provided for ascertaining the state of a catalyst used in the reaction.
