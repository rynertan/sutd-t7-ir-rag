# Intramolecular polymeric complexes viscosifiers for acid, base and salt aqueous solutions.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to improved viscosifi cation agents for a variety of aqueous solutions which com prise a family of intramolecular polymeric complexes i.e., polyampholytes which are terpolymers of acrylamide metal styrene sulfonate methacrylamidopropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride MAPTAC . The metal styrene sulfonate is an anionic monomer, while MAPTAC is cationically charged. These acrylamide based polyampholytes may have 1 to 50 mole of the anionic monomer and 1 to 50 mole of the cationic moiety present within the macromolecular structure. These groups are not necessarily present in an equimolar charge ratio. The excess undissociated charge allows for facile dispensability or solu bility of the polyampholytes into fresh water.
