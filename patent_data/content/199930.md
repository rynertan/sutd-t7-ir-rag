## Description
An inorganic hydrated oxide, precipitated from an aqueous solution of a corresponding metal cation, washed and then dried in air or under a vacuum yields a porous oxide product. The porous oxide product, produced from the gel the precipitated inorganic hydrated oxide in the solvent by removing the solvent water under conditions of temperature and pressure less than the supercritical conditions at or above which the solvent would exist as a supercritical fluid , has been given the name xerogel by A. Fruendlich It is known to produce the hydrated inorganic oxides by hydrolysis of metal alkoxides. The hydrated oxides which precipitate are removed from the aqueous suspension by, for example, filtering or centrifugation, and are subsequently washed and dried in ovens to yield the oxide. Such processes have been described in Preparation, Characterization, and Comparison of Properties of Alumina Catalysts, The step of drying solutions or suspensions to produce particulate materials has been accomplished by a variety of processes. Such processes include oven drying, flame pyrolyzing, and spray drying. Of these processes, spray drying has received considerable attention. Spray drying as defined herein includes flash drying and is a technique in which a solution or suspension is supplied to a heated chamber as a plurality of uniform, fine droplets to remove the solvent. The product produced therefrom is ordinarily spherical and finely divided. The process of spray drying aquagels is disclosed in US A 4,226,743 Seese et al. US A 4,389,385 Ramsey US A 4,407,967 Luks US A 4,297,163 Thomas and US A 2,856,268 Young . The process of spray drying aquagels formed from the hydrolysis of metal alkoxides to produce xerogels is also known. US A Patent 4,407,734 Denton et al. , GB A 1,567,003 Ramsey and a sales brochure from Conoco entitled Catapal SB Alumina describes such processes. The pore volume and surface area of alumina xerogels prepared by these techniques are generally less than 1.7 cm³ g and 260 m² g, respectively. Modifications to the basic processes for producing xerogels have been employed to prepare inorganic products having higher pore volume and surface area. One such method involves the use of additives in the gel. For example, control and enlargement of the pore volume of alumina by the addition of water soluble polymers is described in An alternate approach employed to create high pore volume and surface area products is a process of evacuating the solvent from a gel under supercritical conditions. This process was developed, in part, and reported by Kistler We have discovered that the finely divided porous inorganic oxides can be produced in conventional spray drying apparatus, without the need for high pressures and temperatures by using organic solvents to produce a gel or solution. The pore volumes and surface areas of the spray dried xerogel products are unexpectedly improved as compared to xerogels produced from aquagels, and in some cases approach the textural characteristics of an aerogel. Our invention is directed to a process of producing oxide powders which comprises The admixture is provided as a plurality of droplets by injecting the admixture into the heating zone or by supplying the admixture onto a spinning disk located in the zone to produce the droplets. The process is most preferably conducted in a closed cycle spray drying apparatus. The properties of the xerogel are unexpectedly superior to properties exhibited by xerogels produced by other known spray drying processes. The Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an indirect fired, closed cycle spray dryer used to carry out the process of our invention. Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c are photographs of an aluminum oxide produced by our process. The left half of each of Figures 2a and 2b indicate the portion of the sample illustrated in the blow up right half of each Figure . The magnification is shown in each figure as is the size bar. Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c are comparative photographs of an aluminum oxide produced by the prior art process of aqueous spray drying. As with Figures 2a and 2b, Figures 3a and 3b are divided in half the left half indicating the portion of the sample in the blow up right half . Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c are photographs of a yttria stabilized zirconia product produced in accordance with our process. Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c are comparative photographs of a yttria zirconia product produced by an aqueous spray drying process. There are many applications which require ceramic powder having high pore volumes, large surface area, and small particle sizes. The powders produced by our invention can be used, for example, as pigments or thickeners, as filters, as binders, in the production of molded cast ceramic parts from dry powders or slips, and as catalysts and catalyst supports. For example, catalysts, such as polymerization catalysts, are presently formed on aerogel support materials, or on spray dried support materials from aquagels e.g., Ketjen B alumina support . Of the two support materials, the aerogel support materials appear to be far superior in some respects due to their high pore volume, high surface area and small particle size. However, they are far more costly to produce. Our materials offer the advantages associated with aerogel supports at a cost more closely related to aqueous spray dried materials. The oxide powders of our invention exhibit a high pore volume, large surface area, small particle size, high flowability and a low degree of agglomeration. These properties have not heretofor been available from spray drying techniques. As used herein, the term oxide shall include simple oxide powders e.g., Al₂O₃ , oxide hydroxide, oxide alkoxide, or oxides having OH or OR as surface hydroxy OH , carboxyl or alkoxy OR groups, for example , and mixtures thereof such as mixed oxides e.g., MgAl₂O₄ . Hydrolyzable compounds of both metals and non metals can be employed. More specifically, the hydrolyzable compounds used to produce the oxide powders include compounds of aluminum, barium, calcium, lithium, potassium, magnesium, cerium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium, chromium, zinc, gallium, silicon, antimony, bismuth, strontium, iron, lead, copper, yttrium, molybdenum, tungsten, tin and boron. The powders of our process are produced from a solution or suspension comprising at least one hydrolyzable compound, an organic solvent and an amount of water sufficient to at least partially hydrolyze the hydrolyzable compound. An admixture of the above is supplied to a heating zone as a plurality of fine droplets to produce a product comprising oxide powders, and organic solvent vapors, the organic solvent vapors being subsequently removed to yield the product. Hydrolyzable compounds are selected from the group consisting of organometallic compounds and colloidal suspensions of inorganic salts. Preferably, the hydrolyzable compound is an organometallic compound selected from the group of metal alkoxides, metal acetates, metal alkanoates, metal acetyl acetonates, metal carboxylates mono or di , metal oxalates, metal citrates, or mixtures thereof. Most preferred hydrolyzable compounds include alkoxides, metal acetates, and metal acetyl acetonates. The hydrolyzable compound is suspended or, most preferably, dissolved in an organic solvent. Useful organic solvents include hydrocarbons, ketones, aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons e.g., benzene or toluene , kerosene, glycols especially C₂ or C₃ glycols , ethers, alcohols, or mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the solvent should be miscible with water. The boiling point at 0.1 MPa 1 atm of the organic solvent is less than 130 C, with a boiling point of less than 100 C being preferred. The lower the boiling point, the more efficient the spray drying step of the process. The organic solvent is preferably an alcohol, and most preferably is a C₁ C₅ alcohol because they are very effective in yielding high porosity, high volume area, and fine particle size powders. Moreover, when employing organometallic compounds, it is highly desirable to choose an organic solvent to produce an admixture which has R groups which are the same as the R group of the ester of the metal which is to be dissolved or suspended e.g., an isopropanol solvent for a metal isopropoxide . Most preferably, organic solvent is added in an amount sufficient to completely dissolve the hydrolyzable compound to produce a solution. Production of a solution ensures homogeneity of the system, thus increasing the efficiency of production and the uniformity of the final product. To the suspended or dissolved hydrolyzable compound is added a liquid comprising water. The amount of water added must be sufficient to at least partially hydrolyze the hydrolyzable compound. Although the water could be added to the hydrolyzable compound prior to the addition of the organic solvent, adding the water to the solution is clearly preferable to uniformly hydrolyze the hydrolyzable compound. The amount of water to be added depends on the reaction constituents being employed and the desired properties of the powder to be produced. Generally, the amount of water added is an amount necessary to substantially hydrolyze all of the hydrolyzable compound, and, in many instances the amount is the stoichiometric amount. However, the amount can range from at least 10 of the stoichometric amount to amounts greater that the stoichiometric amount. An amount of water substantially above the stoichiometric amount tends to reduce the pore volume and surface area of the powders, and tends to increase particle size and the degree of agglomeration of the powders. Moreover, excessive amounts of water tend to increase the viscosity of and degree of settling of products from the admixture which reduces the ease of spray drying. Therefore, the amount of water should not exceed more than 110 of the stoichiometric amount, and most preferably is no more than about the stoichiometric amount. The liquid comprising water may also include, for example, acid, base or alcohol. When a mixture of water and alcohol is added, the preferred alcohol to add to the water is selected from the group of C₁ C₅ alcohols. As noted above, small amounts of acids and bases may be added to the admixture. They are added to control the pH of the admixture gel or solution . The pH of the gel or solution is a factor which is responsible for controlling the size of the primary product particles. Most preferably, the pH of the admixture is maintained between 2 and 10 to produce primary product particles of a size less than 1 µ , usually 0.5 µ or less. Although the pH varies for each combination of reactants, one of ordinary skill in this art could determine the appropriate pH for each class of reactants by analyzing the admixture, for example, by sedimentation analysis, transmition electron microscopy or photo correlation spectoscopy to determine the presence of hydrolyzed metal compound. Surfactants may also be added to the admixture. They are added to modify the physical properties of the oxide products. They include binders to increase the degree of ultimate packing of the particles, dispersants to reduce particle agglomeration in the suspension and consequently particle size in the product, sintering aids, etc. An additional advantage of our novel process is the ability to add dopants to the admixture to enhance the utility of the final product. For example, BaTiO₃ is finding increasing utility in the electronics industry. However, conventional techniques of producing barium titanate suffer from the drawback of non uniform levels of doping. Our process overcomes this drawback by producing a solution homogeneous which is subsequently hydrolyzed to produce a uniformly doped product. The admixture is spray dried to produce the metal oxides. The term spray drying includes opened cycle spray drying, closed cycle spray drying, semi closed cycle spray drying and flash drying. Among these techniques, open, semi closed and closed cycle spray drying techniques are preferred. Although each of the techniques is well known to those of ordinary skill in this art, a basic description of the preferred techniques can be found in Masters, K., The admixture is introduced to the heating zone as a plurality of fine droplets. The droplet size is controlled primarily by the apparatus used to form the droplets and by the viscosity of the admixture. In most instances, the droplets have an effective diameter of not more than 100 µ . Although our invention contemplates the use of any known system capable of producing fine droplets e.g., atomizing the admixture , such as spray nozzles of a variety of designs e.g., pneumatic nozzles, sonic nozzles, and pressure nozzles or rotary atomizers such as rotating wheels or disks , rotating wheels or disks are preferred as evidenced by the Examples, although we believe that sonic nozzles may be more preferable. The viscosity of the admixture is influenced by such factors as the reactants employed, the temperature of the admixture when supplied to the droplet forming apparatus, the binders used if any , the concentration of hydrolyzed metal compound in the solvent, and the amount of water used. The effects of these factors are illustrated in the Examples. In our process, spray drying occurs in a heating zone at temperatures and pressures below the critical temperature and pressure of the organic solvent in the admixture. Moreover, the admixture viscosity, the feed rate, the air flow, and the inlet and outlet temperatures of the spray dryer will influence the properties of the final product. In addition, certain physical parameters of the apparatus such as the design, size and construction of the spray dryer columnar or tower type, vortical or conical bottom, etc. and the method of supplying the heating medium to the heating zone co current, counter current, mixed flow, etc. will influence the temperatures, pressures and residence time of the admixture within the heating zone and, consequently, the properties of the xerogel. One of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that any of a variety of combinations of the factors can be used provided, however, the energy within the heating zone is sufficient to remove substantially all of the organic solvent employed to produce the admixture which, in turn, yields the metal oxide product. The general relationship between the different operating parameters and the final product properties are well known and have been discussed in Masters, The products produced by our process are generally characterized as loosely agglomerated primary particles and or aggregates of primary particles having a generally spherical form at the aggregate and primary particle level. As used herein, agglomerates are defined as a jumbled mass or collection of at least two more primary particles or aggregates held together by relatively weak cohesive forces. The agglomerates are generally between 1 and 10 µ in effective spherical diameter the diameter of a spherical mass having a volume equal to the volume of the agglomerate . Aggregates, as used herein, are defined as a dense mass of primary particles held together by strong intermolecular or atomic cohesive forces. Aggregates are generally between 1 and 5 µ in effective diameter the diameter of a spherical mass having a volume equal to the volume of the aggregate . A primary particle is defined as a discrete low porosity crystal such as a single crystal, polycrystal or a glass. As noted above, the primary particles are usually less than 1 µ in diameter effective and ordinarily range from .05 .7 µ in many instances .5 µ in diameter. In the preferred embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the inlet temperature the temperature of the drying medium when supplied to the heating zone is at least 120 C, preferably between 140 C and 195 C, and the outlet temperature the temperature of the heating medium removed with the product from the zone is at least 70 C, preferably at least 80 90 C. While the process may be performed at any pressure below that pressure at which the combination of pressure and temperature would be above the critical temperature and pressure, the process is most preferably carried out under a pressure of about 0.1 MPa 1 atm or less of drying medium gas . Figure 1 schematically illustrates an indirect heated, closed cycle spray drying apparatus operated by Bowen Engineering Inc., Somerville, N.J. of the type preferably employed in producing our novel metal oxide powders. As illustrated, the gel one form of the admixture is supplied to a supply line 1. Compressed gas is applied via a line 2 to aid in feeding the admixture to the spray dryer. Optionally, cooling water is fed via a line 3 to cool the supply line 5 used to deliver the admixture to spray drying chamber 9, thus preventing premature vaporization of the admixture in the nozzle. Nitrogen or some other non oxygen containing gas i.e., a gas having a maximum O₂ content less than or equal to 0.1 , and preferably less than the lower explosion limit for the solvent is supplied via a line 4 to the spray drying chamber 9 to function as the drying medium. In operation, the nitrogen is initially cycled through the system and thereafter continuously recycled with make up nitrogen being supplied through the nozzle 4 as needed. The nitrogen is heated to the appropriate drying temperature in a preheater 7 e.g., a steam heater and is supplied cocurrently to the spray drying chamber 9 through a line 7 and circumferential supply opening 8. The gel is fed through the line 1 via the compressed gas supplied through line 2 to the supply line 5 which feeds the gel through a nozzle 10. Within the spray drying chamber 9 is a rotating wheel or disk 11 which functions to atomize the gel. In spray drying chamber 9, a product comprising oxide powders, and vapors comprising water and organic solvent are produced from the gel. The product and vapors are pumped through outlet 12 and supply line 13 to a separater 14 e.g., a cyclone separator wherein the product is separated from the vapor. The product is removed from the separator via outlet 15. The vapor, containing reaction product fines is drawn off through take off vent 16 and supplied by a line 17 through a nozzle 18 to a baghouse 19. In the baghouse 19, the product fines are collected and removed via outlet 20. The remaining vapor, essentially free of product, is removed from the baghouse via take off 21 and is supplied via a line 22 to an absolute filter 23 capable of removing ultrafine powders smaller than about 0.5 µ . The clean vapor is supplied via a line 24, a primary fan 25, and a line 26 to a condenser 27 which functions to condense the organic solvent and water vapor. The remaining gas, primarily nitrogen, is fed to a demister 28 wherein any remaining organic solvent and water vapor are condensed . The nitrogen gas, leaving the demister 28 is fed via line 29 by a secondary fan 30 and through a line 31 to the preheater 7, whereafter the cycle is repeated. While the above detailed description of the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 represents applicants preferred embodiment for operating the process, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many changes, modifications, additions and deletions may be provided without departing from the scope of the embodiment illustrated. Moreover, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many changes, modifications, additions, and deletions may be provided without departing from the scope of the claims. Examples 1 16 illustrate the scope of the products which can be produced by our process, and various modifications of process parameters used to form the admixtures which are spray dried to produce the metal oxide products.

Over a period of 15 min., a solution of 796 cm³ of deionized water 44.2 mole in 2.7 liters of methanol was added to the alkoxide the hydrolysis reaction is exothermic with a temperature rise of 5 to 10 C . Using a 3 in. 7.6 cm , Cowles mixer blade stirring was continued at 2000 3000 rpm for an additional 30 min. This procedure was repeated six times in order to synthesize about 4.5 Kg 10 lbs of alumina. Some settling of this gel occured on standing overnight. It was easily redispersed using the Cowles mixer. The suspension was poured through a 841 µm 20 mesh screen into a large feed tank for supply to a spray dryer. The suspension gel , containing 10.0 wt solids after screening, was spray dried in an indirect fired, closed cycle spray dryer conical bottom type 76.2 cm diameter BSLA dryer, Bowen Eng. Inc. using a Centrifugal AT 4, 5.1 cm 2 CSE atomizer. The suspension was fed at ambient temperature to the atomizer at a rate of 239 g min., and atomized under a force of 0.8 MPa 100 psig . The inlet temperature of the spray dryer was 150 C, the outlet temperature was maintained at 90 C. An aluminum oxide was produced according to the following procedure.

With constant stirring, the solution was heated to 40 C and then another solution of 90 cm³ 5 moles of deionized water in 500cc of methanol was slowly added to the alkoxide. A 30 C exotherm developed in the suspension as well as substantial gelation of the mixture. The extent of gelation can be controlled by the addition of additional alcohol and continued, vigorous stirring with a large propellor type stirrer. This suspension was mixed with a Cowles mixer and screened through a 0.71 mm 25 mesh screen prior to spray drying in a closed cycle spray dryer. The suspension, containing 14.5 wt solids after screening, was spray dried in the same equipment used for Example 1 under the same conditions, except the feed rate was 205 cm³ min.

From the results in Table 1, some of the unique properties of products produced by our process are readily apparent. As compared to aluminum oxide xerogels produced from aquagels, aluminum oxide xerogels produced by our process Examples 1, 2, 8 modified with Ca , and 14 generally exhibit a pore volume greater than 2 cm³ g and a surface area of greater than 400 cm² g. These properties are substantially higher than values obtained for aqueous xerogels and approach values obtained for aluminum oxide aerogels. The following Examples illustrate an additional feature of our invention. Improved products can be produced by coating base materials with products produced from the admixed reactants. 10 gm of Mg OEt ₂ .087 mole was dissolved in 90 cm³ of methanol with stirring for 5 min. . A mixture of 10 cc of methanol and 1.3 cc water 0.072 mole was added dropwise from a separatory funnel, with vigorous stirring, and 350 gms 8.9 mole of MgO 0.3 mm 48 mesh , NARCO was added. This suspension was diluted to 1.57 l 1 2 gallon with sec butanol. The suspension, containing 11.5 wt solids after straining through a 0.71 mm 25 mesh screen, was spray dried using the apparatus described in Example 1 under the following conditions the outlet temperature was 80 C and, the feed rate was 467 cm³ min. The product produced by this procedure was MgO coated with aqueous agglomerates of MgO produced from alkoxide. Since sterically hindered silicon alkoxides undergo hydrolysis at a much slower rate than simple alkoxides, a suspension was prepared in a manner similar to that described in Example 16 but with tetrabutoxysilane. To a 250 cm³ beaker was added 27.9 gm 0.087 mole of tetrabutoxysilane, 100 cm³ of sec butanol, and 1.5 gm .083 mole of deionized water in 10 cm³ of sec butanol. This mixture was added to one liter of warm tert butanol. 350 gms. of MgO 0.3 mm 48 mesh NARCO was added to this solution with vigorous stirring. The suspension was spray dried in the apparatus described in Example 1. The operating conditions were not varied from those described in Example 1, except the feed rate was 333 cm³ min. The product produced by this procedure was MgO coated at the high free energy locations corners with spherical silica produced from the alkoxide. As a control, the process of Example 17 above was substantially repeated, but without any added silicon alkoxide. The only modifications were a reduced atomizing force of 0.72 MPa 90 psig and a higher feed rate 400 cm³ min . The product produced by this process did not exhibit the formation of a coating on the surface of the substrate MgO particles . In order to demonstrate the differences between aqueous and non aqueous spray drying, we prepared three different types of alumina containing suspensions for comparison. In addition, we prepared prior art solutions aqueous suspensions and solutions employed in our process for comparison. The processes are described in Examples 19 24 hereinbelow, and the results are illustrated in Table 2. While there are some limits with regard to the differences between aqueous versus non aqueous spray drying, there are also dramatic differences. Generally, non aqueous spray drying is characterized by a material which displays a higher surface area, a much larger pore volume, somewhat finer particle size, a much lower bulk density, a greater degree of fluidity, and a definite change in texture in the individual particles as compared to powders produced by aqueous spray drying. To some extent, these differences are believed to be controlled by the source of the suspension which is sprayed. Nevertheless, there are a sufficient number of major differences in the macro and microscopic physical properties of these powders. Each spray drying procedure in Examples 19 24, infra, was carried out in the apparatus described in Example 1, unless otherwise indicated. Each example indicates the inlet and outlet temperatures of the spray dryer and the feed rate of the suspension to the reaction zone. 269 gm of superground A 16 alumina ALCOA, CM4422 was first wetted with 600 cm³ of distilled water. While stirring, 5.4 liters of isopropanol was added, and the mixture was shear stirred with a Cowles mixer 2500 rpm for 1 hr . Some settling had occurred over the 24 hr. period prior to spray drying. The suspension containing 10.5 wt solids, was spray dried under the following conditions inlet temp. 140 C outlet temperature 90 C feed rate 247 cm³ min. 400 gm of Alon a fumed Al₂O₃ from Cabot was first wetted with 400 cm³ of distilled water as above a critical step to assure proper dispersion while stirring. Isopropanol 3.6 liters was added with stirring and then shear strirred at 3500 rpm for 1 2 hrs. Some settling occurred on standing overnight, but the suspension, containing 9.5 wt solids, was re established by additional shear mixing prior to spray drying under the following conditions inlet temp. 140 C outlet temp. 90 C feed rate 325 cm³ min. 500 gm of aluminum sec butoxide Alfa Inorganics and 0.8 gm of magnesium ethoxide ground to a powder were stirred together for 1 hr. at 70 C to yield a fine suspension. This hot mixture was slowly added to 360 cm³ of water also at 70 C while stirring at 2500 rpm with the Cowles mixer 7.5 cm 3 in. blade . An additional 700 cm³ of sec butanol had to be added to maintain a pourable suspension. 10 cm³ of glacial acetic acid was slowly added to the suspension to peptize the alumina and stirring was continued for 2 hrs. Next, an additional 2540 cm³ of sec butanol was added. The suspension, containing 3 wt solids, was spray dried under the following conditions inlet temp. 140 C outlet temp. 90 C feed rate 300 cm³ min. A wetted alumina prepared as in Example 19 above was dispersed in 6 liters of distilled water. Some settling occurred overnight, but the material was redispersed with a Cowles mixer and screened through a 0.84 mm 20 mesh screen prior to drying in an open cycle drier. The open cycle spray dryer employs the same dryer as is employed in the closed cycle system described in Example 1. However, the operating conditions are significantly different. The suspension containing 3 wt solids was spray dried open cycle under the following conditions inlet temperature 210 C outlet temperature 117 C feed rate 120.5 cm³ min. A wetted alumina prepared as in Example 20 above, was dispersed in 4 liters of deionized water. Prior to drying, the suspension was redispersed and screened as in Example 20 above. The suspension, containing 9 wt solids, was dried in the open cycle dryer under the following conditions inlet 260 C outlet temp. 130 C feed rate 180 cm³ min. The aluminum sec butoxide suspension of Example 21 was added to 3600 cm³ of deionized water at 70 C in place of the sec butanol. Acetic acid was used again to peptize the alumina. The suspension, containing 4.5 wt solids, was redispersed with a Cowles mixer prior to spraying in the open cycle dryer under the following conditions inlet temp. 295 C outlet temp. 138 C feed rate 169 cm³ min. As shown in Table 2, the powders derived from suspending a commercial fine powder in a mixture of alcohol and water or in water alone show inferior properties. Examples 19, 20, 22, and 23 It is believed that the properties of these powders are largely controlled by the raw material itself. However, aluminas derived from alkoxides Example 21, illustrated in Figs. 2a, 2b, and 2c, and Example 24, illustrated in Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c exhibit an increased surface area as compared to nonhydrolyzable metal compounds. In addition, differences in the properties of the alkoxide derived oxides are clearly apparent depending upon the admixture used. In each of Examples 21 and 24, the alkoxide alcohol a fine particle aluminum oxide less than 0.2 µ in suspension. When spray dried in the presence of alcohol, the product appears to exist as aggregates of very fine primary particles about 0.2 µ size, Fig. 2c . Moreover, the surface of these aggregates Fig. 2b and 2c appears to resemble a much looser assembly of particles than that of the powder produced from the purely aqueous suspension Fig. 3b and 3c . In the latter case, we observe somewhat larger particles which appear to have a dense structure. Additionally, aluminas derived from alkoxides in a non aqueous medium also exhibit a significant increase in surface area and a reduced density by He pyrometry . Furthermore, as between aqueous and non aqueous spray drying in accordance with our invention, non aqueous spray drying offers unexpected improvements in both the pore volume and the surface area of the spray dried products. Examples 25 and 26 hereinbelow describe processes for spray drying yttria stabilized zirconia in accordance with our process using the preferred closed cycle spray dryer as compared to spray drying process employing aqueous suspensions, Examples 27 and 28 hereinbelow. The results are set forth in Table 3. 46 gm YCl₃.6H₂O 0.15 moles and 400 gm of ZrOCl₂. H₂O 1.6 moles both materials from Alfa Inorganics were dissolved in 2 liters of distilled water Millipore treated . This turbid solution was added via a dropping funnel to another solution of 300 cm³ of concentrated NH₄OH in 6 liters of distilled water. The fluffy, white precipitate was allowed to stand overnight. Not much settling occurred, and attempts to filter the solid through coarse filter paper proved to be a slow, tedious process. The solid was suspended and was washed five times with water in order to remove the excess chloride ion. The solid was washed twice with isopropanol prior to suspending the slurry with about 7.9 l 2.5 gallon of isopropanol. During the next 24 hrs. some settling occurred so that another 3.15 l gallon of solvent could be poured off and replaced with pure isopropanol. This suspension was stirred with a Cowles mixer for about 3 hrs. The mixture was screened through 0.71 mm 25 mesh screen prior to spraying. The suspension, containing 15.0 wt solids, was sprayed in the apparatus as described in Example 1, under the following modified conditions the atomizing force was the force generated at 50,000 rpm the inlet temperature was 103 C the outlet temperature was 70 C and, the feed rate was 269 cm³ min. This preparation was similar to Example 25 above, but performed at twice the scale When Example 26 was originally dried, the heater for the dryer failed and thus the relatively low drying temperature of 105 C . The procedure was repeated in order to obtain material dried at a drying temperature of 140 C. With the difficulty in filtering the previous preparation, we used successive washings and decantations with distilled water. The early washings added NH₄OH, but this eventually produced a cloudy layer which did not settle. Elimination of the NH₄OH produced a better separation. A total of 12.6 l four gallons of isopropanol was added to the slurry prior to spraying. The suspension, containing 4.5 wt solids after straining through a 0.71 mm 25 mesh screen, was spray dried in the apparatus described in Example 1 under the modified conditions as follows the inlet temperature was 140 C and, the feed rate was 170.2 cm³ min. Using the same scale as in Example 26, 92 gm of YCl₃.6 H₂O 0.3 moles and 800 gm ZrOCl₂ 3.2 moles were dissolved in 11 liters of distilled water. Once again 300 gm of NH₄OH in 1.7 liters of water was added via a dropping funnel over a period of 30 min. Additional NH₄OH was added until the solution was quite basic. The suspension was washed and decantated with successive amounts of water. A small amount of a dilute solution of p hydroxybenzoic acid was added to disperse the solids. 8.2 l 2.6 gallons of this aqueous suspension, containing 7 wt solids, was dried using the apparatus described in Example 20 open cycle at an inlet temperature of 225 C and an outlet temp. of 178 C, and at a feed rate of 132 cm³ min. This experiment was similar to Example 27, but at half the scale and with added HCl to maintain the acidity. 46 gm YCl₃.6 H₂O and 400 gm ZrOCl₂ were dissolved in 8 liters of water to 200 cm³ NH₄OH in 1500 cc H₂O, and stirred at 3500 rpm with the Cowles mixer. The suspension was repeatedly washed and decanted with water. 60 cc of concentrated HCl was added to bring the suspension to a pH of 2. 0.39 gm of p hydroxybenzoic acid in 5 cm³ of absolute ethanol was added. This suspension 6.3 l 2 gallons was sprayed in the open cycle dryer at an inlet temperature of 225 C and an outlet temperature of 178 C, at a feed rate of 155 cm³ min. As shown in Table 3 above and as illustrated in Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c, and Figs. 5a, 5b, and 5c for the yttria zirconia Y Zr system, substantial differences in surface area, pore volume, bulk density, particle size, and morphology are observed. The direction of the differences derived by our process Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c vs. an aqueous process Figs. 5a, 5b, and 5c is the same as that observed for other oxides e.g., the aluminas . The difference in surface area between the aqueous and non aqueous routes clearly illustrated in Figs. 4c and 5c, respectively is a critical factor in handling the powder. Aluminum isopropoxide Chatham Chemical Co. was suspended in 5.4 ℓ of isopropanol. The mixture was heated with stirring to 70 C at which temperature most of the AIP dissolved, forming a hazy solution. The temperature was held for 60 minutes and then 452 mL of D.I. water were added. A thick precipitate formed immediately upon addition of the water. After an additional 5 minutes at temperature, 1.35 ℓ of methanol were added. Stirring was continued for 30 minutes. Spray drying of the wet alumina gels was carried out using an indirectly heated, closed cycle dryer because of the flammable organic solvent involved. Before spray drying, the mixture was agitated using a Cowles mixer for 15 minutes and then poured through a 0.71 mm 25 mesh screen. The physical properties of the spray dried alumina, as a function of operating conditions, are summarized in Table 4. From the results obtained from the two runs reported in Table 4, it appears that an increase in nozzle pressure at constant temperatures will increase the surface area and pore volume. As noted heretofore, the use of a spray nozzle clearly produces an acceptable product even though the use of a centrifugal atomizing wheel is preferred. The enhanced utility of a product produced by our process is illustrated in the following Example. Aluminum isopropoxide Chatham Chemical Co. 943g was suspended in 6.0 l of isopropanol. The mixture was heated with stirring to 70 C at which temperature most of the AIP dissolved, forming a hazy solution. The temperature was held for 30 minutes and the 250 ml of D.I. water were added. A thick precipitate formed immediately upon addition of the water. After an additional 30 minutes at temperature, 1.5 l of methanol were added. Stirring was continued for 15 minutes at 70 C. Spray drying of the wet alumina gels was carried out using an indirectly heated, closed cycle dryer. The physical properties of the spray dried alumina, as a function of operating conditions, are summarized in Table 5. The sample was calcined in flowing oxygen in a tube furnace, using a 4 hour program to reach 700 C. Another portion of the same alumina sample was calcined at 550 C. The surface areas and the pore volumes, as a function of calcination temperature, are recited in Table 6 and indicate that an increase in calcination temperature yields a dramatically different particle substantially lower in surface area coupled with a somewhat reduced pore volume . More specifically, it appears from this example that the pores tend to coalesce, thus reducing the surface area to a much greater extent than the pore volume. An ethylene polymerization catalyst was prepared from the 700 C calcined material by contacting the support with TiCl₄ in heptane at 25 C. The dried, impregnated catalyst was tested for polymerization activity in a 2 L SS autoclave reactor. Conditions included 1 L isobutane, 85 C, 1 hour 3.79 MPa 37.4 atm total pressure. The catalyst was run at two H₂ C₂H₄ ratios with the results reproduced in Table 7 Run Nos. 1 2 .. The polymerization activity productivity, Run 1 and Run 2 is higher than that of prior art TiCl₄ catalysts based on aqueous spray dried alumina e.g., Ketjen NFF, Run 3 but not as high as alumina aerogel catalysts Run 4 . A comparison of a variety of properties of an alumina aerogel and of a spray dried alumina xerogel, each produced from the same suspension, are reported in Table 8 below. Table 8 clearly illustrates the similarity in properties obtained by our process as compared to an aerogel. Of particular importance is the similarity in fluidity of both samples which indicates the utility of our spray dried materials as, for example, thickeners cf. Cab O Sil . The effect of aging of an alumina gel sample prepared by hydrolysis of alkoxide in isopropanol on the final properties of the spray dried xerogel are reported in Table 9 below. These results suggest a slight growth of the final product particles as the aging of the gel increases, but the gel does not appear to have undergone any substantial changes on aging. It is believed that for this system, the particle growth has ceased due to the rapid rate of hydrolysis of the metal compound i.e., hydrolysis of the metal compound was substantially complete prior to aging .
