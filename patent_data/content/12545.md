## Description
Semiconductor Integrated Circuit and Fabrication Methods this invention relates to semiconductor inte ated circuits including a plurality of bipolar transistors. Tranristorss in integrated circuits conventionally are fabricated for optimum operation in the downward mode because the diffusion of impurities is downward fros the top surface so that impurity concentration gradients thus produced enhance the performance of transistors operated in the downward lode. These transistors are referred to as downward transistors0 Conventionally the base zone is fomed by impurity introduction followed by a similar process for forming the emitter zone. Generally this enables sone control over the width of the base zone, an important factor in transistor switching speed.Moreover, the emitter zone is usually the smallest zone of the transistor and thus usually has the least parasitic capacitance . In circuit canfigurations in Yhich the collector is connected to a fixed voltage node, the smaller emitter advantageously is connected to a varying node so as to reduce the power required to switch the transistor.However, there are integrated circuit configurations in which the emitter is connected to a fixed voltage node and it would be desirable to have a small collector region to connect to the varying node. In integrated injection logic, also termed merged transistor logic, the switching transistor is operated in the upward node. Circuits have been proposed providing other fores of logic on the same chip with injection logic. These considerations suggest the desirability of providing within one semiconductor integrated circuit chip, transistor configurations suitable for operating in both the downward and upward node and ihich also mag include lateral transistors suitable for merged transistor logic structures. Upward mode transistors having up ditfused base zones are knawn, as disclosed, for example, in U.8. Patent 4,101,349. The upward node transistor tt this disclosure primarily is of the junction isolated type which is generally accompanied by high parasitic effects, particularly capacitances. Moreover, for transistors with suitable analog capability, a higher degree of isolation, such as is provided by local oxide regions, is desirable. Although briefly suggested in the above noted reference, the form of oxide isolation thus disclosed involves certain disadvantages. In particular, isolation regions of silicon oxide are formed by thermal oxidation of silicon semiconductor material. Insofar as applicants are aware, the practice heretofore has been to perform such oxidation at relatively high temperatures. This appears to have several disadvantages. If done subsequent to impurity implantation and diffusion, the thermal oxidation tenperature tends to move the precisely placed PE junctions and to change impurity concentration gradients.The growth of silicon oxide at high tenperature also causes an impurity segregation in semiconductor material adjoining the oxide rendering the adjoining zones susceptible to conductivity type inversion. Conduction channels sting from such inversion are countered by channel stops requiring additional fabrication steps. U.s. Patent 4,087,900 to A . iannoulos discloses an injection logic configuration in a semiconductor chip which also includes downward node transistors. However, the upward mode transistor is the injector rather than the switching transistor and is of the opposite conductivity type and thus does not lend itself to the flexibility of application provided where upward and downward transistors are of the same polarsty and are roughly comparable in frequency response and speed. TheTiannoulos patent does not utilise oxide isolation and is a relatively complex fabrication procedure. In the integrated circuit as claimed a pair of vertical transistors of the same polarity are included in a single integrated circuit, one being an upward mode transistor and the other a downward mode transistor. The transistors can thus be made to have comparable speed and other performance characteristics and, contrary to what might be supposed, this can be achieved without signigicantly complicating the fabrication process. Thus, the invention gives the circuit designer the flexibility to choose or combine, as appropriate, transistors in which the emitter is the smallest zone or in which the collector is the smallest zone to optimise the power delay product for each of the various parts of an inte ated circuit.Also, by combining upward and downward mode transistors using a common buried region, a significant reduction in circuit area may be obtained. Furthermore, in the fabrication method as claimed electrical isolation is provided by local oxide regions thermally grown at a sufficiently low temperature that there is substantially no movement impurities already enplaced or impurity segregation. Bone embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which PIGS. 1 to 7 show in section a portion of an integrated circuit according to the invention in successive stages of fabrication and PIG. 8 shows in section another portion of an integrated circuit according to the invention. Referring first to FIG. 7, the cross sectional view shows a portion 10 of a silicon semiconductor chip which includes vertical upward and downward transistors and a lateral transistor and in which isolation is provided both in a conventional manner by reverse biased PS junctions and more particularly by local oxide regions.The left portion of the structure shown in FIG. 7 which includes, and is above, the E buried layer 13, comprises an injection logic portion consisting of a PEP lateral transistor which is the inJector and an XPS vertical transistor functioning in the upward mode and constituting the switching transistor of the logic configuration. The lateral transistor is composed of the P zone 21, the N zone 17B and P zone 22. The upward mode switching transistor comprises the N emitter zone 13, the P type base zone 19A and N type collector zone 17C. As is known, the base of the switching transistor and the collector of the injector transistor are merged.These are the P type zones 19A and 22, and electrode 42 thus is both a collector contact for the lateral transistor and a base contact for the switching transistor. Electrode 41 is the injector contact to the P type emitter 21. Electrode 43 is the collector contact of the switching transistor and electrode 44 is the contact through N zones 33B and 17C to the N type emitter zone 13. In the right portion of the chip portion 10 above the N type buried zone 14, there is provided a conventional XPS transistor for operating in the downward mode. This transistor comprises the N type emitter 34, P type base zone 25 and N type collector zones 17D and 14. Contact to the collector zone is by way of N type zones 35 and 17D . Electrode 45 to P type base zone 25 constitutes the base electrode, electrode 46 is the emitter electrode and electrode 47 is the collector electrode. Dielectric isolation between the several active portions of this structure is provided by local oxide regions 6, 37, 38, 39 and 40. FIG. 8 is similar to PIG. 7 in that there is depicted in the left portion of the chip 10 an integrated injection logic unit comprising the lateral and the upward mode transistor. The portion on the right over buried layer 48 is a diffused resistor consisting of the P type zone 50 formed in the N type epitaxial layer 49.Electrodes 52 and 53 are the terminals of the resistor and dielectric layer 51, which may consist of silicon oxide or nitride or both, is a passivating coating. resistors of this type are an essential element of logic circuits and, as will be explained hereinafter, advantageously are fabricated integrally with the other elements of the integrated circuit. A downward mode vertical transistor on another part of the chip 10 is not shown in PIG. 8. Also, as will be more clearly illustrated by the following description of the fabrication procedure, the devices described in FIGS. 7 and 8 have advantageous impurity concentration distributions which enhance their performance. Moreover, as will also become apparent, the structures of PIGS. 7 and 8 are achieved using a procedure which is comparable to the basic conventional procedure for fabricating semiconductor integrated circuits, in particular those of the standard buried collector configuration. This fabrication procedure will now be described. Referring to FIG. 1, the starting material for the semiconductor wafer of which the chip portion 10 is a part is single crystal silicon semiconductor material having a relatively low concentration of an acceptor impurity, typically boron at a concentration, for example, of about 2 x icy4 atoms per cubic centimetre. This is a relatively lightly doped material usually referred to as having it type conductivity and is oriented in or close to one Or the major crystalline orientations. As shown in FIG. 1 there is formed in this chip portion a pair of N type conductivity zones 13 and 14 by the conventional use of a mask 12 and diffusion, or ion implantation and diffusion, using a donor impurity such as antimony. typically these buried layers 13 and 14 have a final depth of about 5.0 microns and a resistlvity of about 20 ohms per square. Referring to PIG. 2, the next step is to introduce selectively into the top surface of the chip portion 10 an acceptor impurity using a reformed mask 15.In a typical procedure, boron is introduced by ion implantation using a relatively heavy dosage of about 2 x 1014 atoms per square centimetre at 100 EEV to form theP type implanted zones 16A, 163, 16C and lED. A suitable diffusion cycle is used to flatten the concentration profile of these impurities within one micron or so from the surface. Zones lEA, 16C and 16D are shown as contacting buried layers 13 and 14. However, these zones ultimately function as channel stops and need not extend completely over the space between buried layers in order to fulfil that function. The semiconductor body then is cleaned and any masking material removed. Next, as shown in FIG. 3, an epitaxial layer 23 is deposited on the surface of the portion 10. This process may be a conventional vapour deposition of single crystal silicon in an epitaxial reactor to produce an N type conductivity layer of about 0.3 ohm centimetres and about 2.5 microns in thickness.Typically, arsenic is used as the impurity in the epitaxial layer. Immediately following the epitaxial deposition step the chip portion surface is covered by a new mask 20 which defines zones 21 and 22 into which boron is diffused to convert these portions to P type conductivity. fflicilly these are relatively heavily doped zones which may be referred to as an extrinsic base in the case of zone 22. During the heat treatment to which the chip portion 13 is subjected during the deposition and diffusion steps, the boron impurity sel ectively implanted into the surface of the original chip portion in zones 16A 16D, diffuses upwardly into the epitaxial layer 23. This upward diffusion forms the P type zones 19A l9D. The P type concentration in these zones consequently is graded in the direction towards the upper surface of the chip portion.The fairly heavy N type concentration in the buried layer zones 13 and 14 overdopes the presence of boron impurities.However, there is a relatively heavy boron concentration in the it type conductivity portions 11 between the buried zones constituted by the zones 18A, 183 and 18C. These zones function as channel stops as previously noted. In a typical embodiment the total upward diffusion defining the location of the PN junction is about 0.6 microns with approximately one half of the upward diffusion occurring during epitaxial deposition and the balance during extrinsic base diffusion. The next step is the selective implantation of an acceptor imputity to form the base zone 25 of the downward mode SPS transistor. This step uses the oxide mask 24 and the selective introduction of boron by a suitable means such as a double ion implantation procedure to produce theP type zone 25 having a resistivity of about 600 ohms per square. A typical double implantation procedure comprises a first dosage of 1 x iso13 per square centimetre at 200 EEV and a dosage of 1 x iso14 per square centimetre at 40 XEV. This step also forms the diffused P type resistor zone 50 shown in PIG. 8. The arrangement shown in PIG. 5 illustrates the selective removal of the material from the surface portion of the chip portion 10 preparatory to the thermal oxidation process. This material is removed in selected areas to form recesses 27 31 to a predetermined depth in preparation for the formation within the recesses of silicon dioxide. The recesses advantageously are produced by suitable etching either chemically or by a plasma process. In a typical example, after the formation of the silicon nitride mask, the surface is selectively etched to a depth of about 0.9 microns to produce the recesses 27 31.An advantageous procedure is a process combining anisotropic and isotropic plasma etching, in which after the anisotropic etching using a process such as is described in British patent application No. 7926037 publicationNo. 2026394 a shorter isotropic plasma etching is done using trifluorochloremethane CCtZ3 . ASter forming the recesses and before the thermal oxidation step, it sometimes has been found advantageous to deposit a film of silicon oxide on the entire surface of the chip to prevent lifting or separation of the silicon nitride mask layer during subsequent thermal oxidation.Advantageously this is done by pyrolytic reaction and deposition using as a reactant tetraethyl orthosilicate TEOS at a temperature of about 700 degrees C. A deposited oxide thickness of about 200 nm 2000 a is suitable. The thermal growth of the local oxide zones in the unmasked recesses is carried out under conditions of high pressure which enable a lower temperature to be used while retaining a reasonable time for the required growth process. Typically the semiconductor body is installed in a chamber at a pressure in a range of about 20 25 atmospheres, in a steam ambient at a temperature in a range of about 700 900 degrees C for a period of about 8 hours or less. The result is the formation of oxide regions 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 which penetrate to a depth of about 1.9 microns, or approximately twice the depth of the recesses 27 31 and thus provide dielectric isolation between the separated portions of the chip.Of particular significance is the relatively low temperature at which this process of thermal oxidation is carried out. Because of this there occurs little or no movement of the various critically placed impurities in the chip portion. Not only is the location of the various conductivity type zones significant, but the preservation of the original concentration gradients is important.Low temperature, high pressure oxidation thus has significant advantages, when contrasted with the high temperature processing required to produce an equivalent oxide thickness at atmospheric pressure, typically 1050 degrees C for 12 hours. Subsequent to the formation of the local oxide regions 36 40, another oxide mask 32 enables the selective introduction of a donor impurity to form the N type zones 33, 34, and 35. This impurity introduction typically is an ion implantation of arsenic at a dosage of 5 x 1015 to produce relatively heavily doped N type conductivity zones. In particular, zone 34 constitutes the emitter zone of the downward NPN transistor and zones 33 and 35 enable good low resistance contact to the more lightly doped epitaxial zones 17C and 17D for making emitter contact to the upward transistor and collector contact to the downward transistor, respectively. Finally, the structures shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 are produced by a contact window masking step in conventional fashion followed by the formation of the metallic electrodes 41 47 of FIG. 7 and electrodes 41 44, 52, 53 of FIG. 8 as previously described. In an alternative arrangement of integrated injection logic, the collector output of the IPN switching transistor is a Schottky contact. One such arrangement is disclosed in U.s. Patent 4,076,556 to J. Agraz Guerena andA. W. Fulton. The upward transistor disclosed herein is particularly suited for such an arrangement because of the relatively low impurity concentration of the X type zone 17C comprising the collector zone. The alternativeSchottky barrier contact is provided merely by omitting the Nf zone 53L In a preferred embodiment the contact electrodes comprise the series of metals comprising a thin film of platinum which is converted to platinum silicide, followed by lagers of titanium, platinum and gold.This contact metallurgy is disclosed in U.s. Patents 3,287,612 and 3,426,252 to M. P. Lepselter. Contacts of this kind form low resistance, substantially ohmic contacts when applied to silicon containing a high impurity concentration and rectifying or Schottky type contacts to moderate or low impurity doped silicon. As previously noted, referring to FIG. 7, the upward transistor, comprises the emitter zone 13, contacted on the top surface by electrode 44, base zone 19A and collector zone 17C, likewise contacted on the top surface by electrodes 42 and 43, respectively. This transistor has a collector zone of relatively small dimensions and having, as a consequence, relatively low parasitic capacitance.The base zone has a width of about 0.6 microns using current technology. The downward mode transistor, on the other hand, is relatively conventional having an emitter zone 34 of small dimensions and a larger collector zone 14 17D. Both of these zones as well as the base zone 25 are contacted at the top surface by electrodes 45, 46 and 47. The base width of the zone 25 of the downward mode transistor is about 0.3 microns. The peak frequency cutoff values for the devices are about 900 z for the upward mode transistor and in the range of two to three times that value for the downward mode transistor. Thus, the two transistors are comparable in speed. The upward and downward mode transistors may share a common buried layer or, as particulary described above, may be based on isolated buried layers. The common buried layer may constitute, in effect, a bus to which is connected the collectors of a plurality of downward mode transistors and the emitters of a plurality of upward mode transistors. Moreover, these common buried layer configurations also may include merged laterial transistors. The arrangement of FIG. 8 which includes in the right portion of the chip a diffused resistor is particularly advantageous in that the resistor is provided simply as a part of the fabrication method Shich produces the transistors. As previously noted, this process departs from standard buried layer technology only in that it requires one additional selective implant into the original chip for the up ditfused base and one additional diffusion into the epitaxial layer for the extrinsic base. The latter step may be omitted if only the upward and downward mode transistors are formed.
