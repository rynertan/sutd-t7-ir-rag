# Apparatus for irradiating an elongated surface.

## Abstract
Apparatus for irradiating a surface, for example, for irradiating a photopolymer printing roll with ultra violet light. The apparatus utilizes elongated radiation sources 5, 8, 11 with individual reflectors 6, 9, 12 directing the radiation to crossed plane mirror systems 7, 10, 13 which re direct the radiation toward the printing roll. The part of the mounting means for each radiation source at the end of the source between the sources is shielded from its respective mirror system by the rear surface of the other mirror system to expose the roll to substantially uniform intensity of radiation along substantially the entire length of the roll.
