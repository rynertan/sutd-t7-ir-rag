# CATALYST DERIVED FROM MIXTURE OF MANGANESE HYDROXIDE AND MAGNESIUM CONTAINING MATERIAL

## Abstract
A catalyst precursor capable of being calcined to an active catalyst for ortho alkylation of phenols is described. Such precursor composition comprises a mixture of a magnesium containing material, and a manganese hydrox ide formed as a precipitate by bringing together an aqueous solution of a manganese salt and an aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide in the presence of the magnesium con taining material.
