In these cases, as in the pre ceding 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 it will be preferably a release rather than a bell button. 18 Foresight as the preceding numbers in which the preceding numbers in which the two containers are jointed to the luminous spy in autono mous way, so that each of them can act as reserve in case of demage or bad working of the other one.

## Description
The inventions consists of one or more mobile foresights of suitable ma terial lighted by a set of direct or transported lights with optical fi bres to make the hitting of the bull easier even in conditions of insuf ficient light with fire arms of any kind and with those jet ones compressed air and spring carabines, or string arms as bows, crossbows and the like .By the actual state of technique, the present foresights don1t allow to aim at targets when light is insufficient.It is known that under a certain luminous threshold the human eye, less sensible than that one of other animals, is not able to aim exactly and in a short time if he sees the beginning of the sight in a hunting arm, he won t see the muzzle of the barrel.This is the reason for which the undersigned decided to studv accurate lv how to equip an arm to use also with scarce light in a manner, which is simple, not very expensive and suitable to any arm, also already in use, with a mobile apparatus that allows at any moment to take, in few seconds, the arm to pieces for the cleaning, reparation or transport in a case without using any tools.Besides, he wanted the apparatus to be pocket, strong, protected from collisions or vibrations, and hermetictight closure against dust, humi dity and water to be able to be taken off when it wasn t useful and to be inserted in few seconds as soon as necessary.Suitable to anv fire and jet arm, as spring and compressed air guns and to any string arm, as bows and crossbows also for competitions. This apparatus from now on, for the sake of brevity, it will be cal led the invention , consists see enclosed Table n. 1, Pict. 1 of a foresight 1 of suitable material, which is also transparent or opa que partlv, containing a microlamp 2 , fed bv a bipolar little cable 3 , enameled or under sheath, or monopolar if the earth can be utilized, connected with a battery or an accumulator of any kind, preferably from a mercury or silver oxide batterv 1,4 1,5 v , because, for low consumption, thev last many hours, they last many hours, they weigh about two grams and are as large as a nail, contained inside a container 5 of suitable form together with an ignition button, preferably like a bell bv pressing, it closes the circuit and opens it when pressure stops.Dimensions of lamp and eventual slits 7 and their form in foresight 1 are such as to eliminate any dazzling or diffusive halo that could prevent a right aim.In double barrelled gun Pict. 4 the foresight 1 , with slit 7 and joint feet 9 , overlaps with pressure on sight 10 .In Pict. 2 other two types of foresight among the manv we can use for our invention with slit 7 and magnetic paste of attack 11 and with slit 7B and joint feet 9B for monobarrel Pict, 5 and 6 are represented.The wire 3 runs near the sight 10 along the line 8 or between bar rels Pict. 5 or sideways to the barrel Pict. 6 and, the container 5 with battery and button is stuck to the under barrel 12 , where, on shot the fingers of the hand that hold up the under barrel can press the button 6 .Similar solutions not represented allow to utilize the invention for other fire and jet arms.A second solution, very practical, to lead a luminous point or sign in the foresight, consists in assembling Pict. 3 the battery 4 , the but ton รณ and the lamp 2 inside the container 5 .An optical fibre 14 or a thin beam of optical fibres with a smaller diameter sheathed or not, will joint the foresight 15 that must be lighted with the inside of the container 5 through a little hole 16 , gaugetight.The invention will be placed, as already above mentioned about the guns in Pict. 4,5 and 6, with the difference that the lamp 2 , moved from the barrel to the under bare it , that, with blows, has less vibrations and, well protected inside 5 , eventually packed with foam rubber or the like 17 dashed in Pict. 3 , will last unlimitedly.In fact it will be switched on by the shooter some minutes before shooting and switched off immediately aferwards. After firing hundreds of shots it will be still lighted for few hundreds of seconds, i.e. some minutes at the most.The power consumption will be about 300 milliampere in an hour and the life of the battery over 12 hours i. e. only with a battery, over 10.000 shots could be fired.Naturally the optical fibre 14 , inserted with an extreme in 5 , will have the other extreme 18 inserted in the luminous foresight 15 Pict.3 with the last section 19 turned towards the shooter s eve, i.e.touards the butt 20 of the arm.The optical fibre 14 will be able to have any section.The invention will be composed of one or more foresights with slits mo del 7, or 7A or 7B or other similar , the electric little cable 3 or the optical fibre 14 , and the container 5 equipped as in Pict. 1 or in Pict. 3.The above described set will be able to Stay in a small sack or cas, as big as o box matches, of short weight and low price and it will be able to be bought and applied to arms alreadv in possession of the buver or together with the arm, for its equipment.The container 5 will be able to stick to the under barrel 12 Pict. 4 with two magnetic pastes fixed with bioadhesive to the under barrel and to the container, or, in the same way, with two tongues of velcro, or with dovetails.Or, on the other hand, it will be able to stay in a cavity inlaid on the under barrel 12 , leaving the only button of the interrupter, to stick out.In this way the visible side of 5 will be able, anyhow, to be doodled in the stvle of the arm, and it will be able to have, in protection of the invention the milled mark of protection that marks it.The container will be able to open in 13 to take the place of battery, lamp or interrupter the wire 3 or 14 wiU be able even to be replaced if damaged and, in the foresight with lamp, this one will be able to be replaced, lodged in the way of screw, of embedding or in another similar way.
