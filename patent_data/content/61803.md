# Infra red radiation imaging devices and methods for their manufacture.

## Abstract
An array of photovoltaic infra red radiation detector elements 10 are formed in a body 11 , e.g. of cadmium mercury telluride. The body 11 is present on a circuit substrate 1 which may comprise e.g. a silicon CCD for processing signals from the detector elements 10 . An array of regions 13 which form the p n junctions 12 of each detector element 10 with an adjacent body part 14 extend through the thickness of the body 11 at side walls of an array of apertures 20 each of which is associated with a detector element 10 and is preferably formed by ion etching. These regions 13 are electrically connected to substrate conductors 2, 3 in a simple and reliable manner by a metallization layer 23 in the apertures 20 without rendering a significant area of the detector non sensitive to radiation imaged onto the upper surface of the body 11 . At least the back surface of the detector body 11 has a passivating layer 17 at least over the area around and between the apertures 20 to enhance detector element performance, and this back surface is secured to the circuit substrate 1 by a layer 21 of electrically insulating adhe sive. The main body part 14 is connected to a substrate conductor 4 by metallization 24 at a surface portion which is outside of the area of the back surface between the apertures 20 . Using such a securement, ion etching and connection technique, a closely packed array of high per formance detector elements 10 can be obtained on the circuit substrate 1 with a spacing of 100 micrometres or less between adjacent apertures 20 .
