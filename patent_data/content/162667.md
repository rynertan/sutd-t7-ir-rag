# Process for forming thermally stable thermotropic liquid crystalline polyesters of predetermining chain length utilizing aromatic hydroxyl monomer and or aromatic amine monomer.

## Abstract
An improved polymerization process is provided for the formation of a polyester which is capable of forming an an isotropic melt phase and which optionally may include amide linkages. An approximately 0.25 to 4 percent molar excess of aromatic hydroxyl monomer and or aromatic amine mon omer and or an esterified and or amidated derivative thereof is provided in the polymerization zone during the polymer ization reaction. Such monomer imparts dioxyaryl, diami noaryl, or oxyaminoaryl units to the interior of the resulting polymer chains and causes the polymer chains to terminate in hydroxyl end groups and or in esterified derivative thereof and or amino end groups and or an amidated derivative thereof wherein the polymer chains achieve a predetermined average chain length through the depletion of other mono mers present in the polymerization zone. The resulting po lyester unlike the usual product of the prior art is substantially incapable of additional chain growth upon subsequent heat ing and accordingly may be relied upon to maintain a sub stantially constant viscosity during melt processing regardless of the duration of heating.
