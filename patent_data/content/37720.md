# A method of machining using numerical data.

## Abstract
In a method of carrying out a cutting operation using numerical data obtained by tracing a model, a first stylus S1 and a second stylus S2 having, respectively, a smaller radius r1 and a larger radius r2 than the cutting tool are used to trace the model M , thereby producing first and second numerical data P1, P2 . The required numerical data for controlling the cutting tool are obtained by applying a proportional allotment procedure to the first and second numerical data in accordance with the value of the actual radius rc of the cross section of the cutting tool.
