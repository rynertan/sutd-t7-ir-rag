# Synchronous motor.

## Abstract
A hybrid synchronous motor is described, which motor comprises a stator with two sections which are each provided with an annular coil 13, 14 which cooperates with sets of teeth 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 to be magnetized oppositely by said coils. The teeth are arranged in sectors on each section in such a way that the sectors of teeth of one set of teeth lie between those of the other set of teeth. The rotor comprises two rotor sections 20, 21 each having one circularly arranged set of teeth which cooper ates with two sets of teeth of the associated stator section. The two rotor sections are axially spaced by an axially magnetized permanent magnet 22 .
