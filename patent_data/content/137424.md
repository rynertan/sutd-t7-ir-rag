## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 2,4 DICHLOROBENZOTRIFLUORIDE The present invention relates to an industrially advantageous process for producing 2,4 dichlorobenzotrifluoride hereinafter referred to simply as 2,4DCBTF which is useful as a raw material for agricultural chemicals, medicines or dyestuffs. 2,4 DCBTF is usually produced by chlorinating 2,4dichlorotoluene to obtain 2,4 dichlorobenzotrichloride, and then fluorinating the product with hydrogen fluoride.However, the starting material 2,4 dichlorotoluene is expensive, and the process involves a plurality of reaction steps. Under the circumstances, it has been desired to improve the process. Published European Patent Application No. 8,453 discloses a process for producing aromatic trifluoromethyl compounds including 2,4 DCBTF. However, this application does not disclose any specific process for producing 2,4 DCBTF from m dichlorobenzene hereinafter referred to simply as m DCB as the starting material. Besides, it has been found that when the process of this application was applied to m DCB i.e. the starting material of the present invention, the desired 2,4 DCBTF is formed only at a level of about 20 . Thus, this process is not industrially satisfactory for the production of 2,4 DCBTF, and an improvement has been still desired. The present inventors have conducted extensive researches to overcome the difficulty of the process of the above mentioned European Patent Application No.8,453, and have found an industrially advantageous process for the production of 2,4 DCBTF, whereby the desired product is obtainable in good yield as high as at least 60 . Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. Namely, the present invention provides a process for producing 2,4 DCBTF, which comprises reacting m DCB with a halogenated methane of the formula CFxCl 4 x where x is 0, 1 or 2, and hydrogen fluoride at a temperature within a specific range in the presence of a specific catalyst. The specific catalyst is at least one member selected from the group consisting of fluorides of antimony, boron, titanium, tantalum and niobium.Further, there may be employed substances which are convertible to such fluorides in the reaction system, such as chlorides, bromides or iodides of the above mentioned metals. Specifically, there may be mentioned antimony pentafluoride SbF5 , antimony dichlorotrifluoride SbC12F3 , antimony pentachloride SbCl5 , boron trifluoride BF3 , boron trichloride by13 , boron tribromide BBr3 , titanium tetrafluoride TiF4 , titanium tetrachloride TiC14 , tantalum pentafluoride TaF5 , tantalum pentachloride TaCl5 , tatalum pentabromide TaBr5 , niobium pentafluoride NbF5 , niobium pentachloride NbC15 and niobium pentabromide NbBr5 .Among them, at least one member selected from the group consisting of fluorides of antimony, boron, titanium and tantalum, is preferred, including chlorides, bromides and iodides of these metals. From the industrial point of view, at least one member selected from the group consisting of fluorides of antimony6 boron and titanium, is further preferred, including chlorides of these metals. The above mentioned catalysts may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of at least two different kins. The catalyst is usually employed in an amount of from 0.02 to 10 mols, preferably from 0.02 to 1 mol, more preferably from 0.03 to 0.3 mol, per mol of m DCB as the starting material. As specific examples of the halogenated methane of the formula CFXC14 x where x is 0, 1 or 2, there may be mentioned carbon tetrachloride, trichlorofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane. Among them, carbon tetrachloride and trichlorofluoromethane are preferred.From the industrial point of view, carbon tetrachloride is further preferred. The halogenated methane is usually employed in an amount of from 1 to 10 mols, preferably from 1 to 3 mols, per mol of m DCB as the starting material. Hydrogen fluoride is employed usually in an amount of from 3 to 60 mols, preferably from 9 to 60 mols, more preferably from 9 to 30 mols, per mol of m DCB as the starting material. The reaction temperature is from 80 to 1800C, preferably from 80 to 160 0C, more preferably from 100 to 1500C. If the reaction conditioins depart substantialy from the above ranges, there will be disadvantages such that the reactivity tends to be poor, or the formation of byproducts tends to increase, whereby the yield will decrease. The pressure in the closed reactor may be spontaneous pressure under heating in the closed system, which is 2 usually from 5 to 100 kg cm . Further, the air in the closed reactor may be replaced by an inert gas, or the pressure in the reactor may be increased over the level of the above mentioned spontaneous pressure. Further, the pressure may be controlled to a predetermined level by appropriately discharging hydrogen chloride gas generated during the reaction. The reaction is usually completed in from 1 to 20 hours. The obtained reaction mixture is usually subjected to work up such as extraction or distillation, whereby the desired product is obtainable in good yield. 2,4 DCBTF obtained by the process of the present invention, can be converted to 2,4 dichloro 3,5 dinitrobenzene trifluoride by subjecting it to conventional nitration see e.g. U.S. Patent 3,586,725 , and the product can then be converted to e.g. N 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl 2, 6 dinitro 3 chloro 4 trifluoromethylaniline by the method disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,331,670. The aniline derivative thus obtained shows excellent effectiveness for the control of noxious organisms, particularly of germs. Now, the present invention will be described in further detail. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.EXAMPLE 1 Into an autoclave having an internal capacity of 50 ml, 3.0 g of m DCB, 8,0 g of carbon tetrachloride and a stirrer were put, and then cooled to OOC.
