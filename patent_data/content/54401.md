# ELECTRIC LIGHT SOURCE WITH INTEGRAL SWITCH

## Abstract
An electric lamp 30 incorporates an integral mercury switch 37 with the lamp structure to provide an attitude sensitive light source. The mercury switch may be incorpo rated within the lamp envelope, either with the filament or in a separate compartment of the envelope, within a specially extended portion of an exhaust tube, or within a cap structure sealed to the light source envelope. The mercury switch is either specially fabricated during formation of the lamp structure, or may comprise a preformed capsule. The unit may be fitted in conventional screw bayonet and other sockets in the same manner as a corresponding ordinary lamp.
