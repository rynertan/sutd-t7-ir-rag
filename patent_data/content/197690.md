## Description
This invention relates to the polymerization of olefins. More particularly, this invention relates to a process having catalyst compositions which are useful for polymerizing one or more monomers comprising ethylene to polymers having an intermediate molecular weight distribution and a good balance of physical properties. It is known that catalysts of the type variously described as coordination, Ziegler, Ziegler type, or Ziegler Natta catalysts are useful for the polymerization of olefins under moderate conditions of temperature and pressure. It is also known that the properties of the polymers obtainable by the use of such catalysts, as well as the relative economies of the processes used to prepare the polymers, vary with several factors, including the choice of the particular monomers, catalyst components, polymerization adjuvants, and other polymerization conditions employed. During the years since Ziegler catalysts were first publicly disclosed, there has been a considerable amount of research conducted on the use of such catalysts and numerous publications have resulted from that research. These publications have added much to the knowledge of how to make various types of olefin polymers by various types of processes. However, as is apparent from the amount of research on Ziegler catalysis that is still being conducted throughout the world, as well as the number of patents that are still being issued to inventors working in the field of Ziegler catalysis, the means of attaining certain results when polymerizing olefins with Ziegler catalysts are still frequently unpredictable. The fact that this situation exists is sometimes due to the need to obtain a previously unattainable combination of results occasionally due to difficulties in obtaining the same results in a commercial scale apparatus as in a laboratory scale reactor and often due to a polymerization parameter s having an effect, or side effect, in a given type of polymerization process that is different from effects achieved by its use in prior art processes of a different type. One aspect of Ziegler catalysis in which the need for further research has been found to exist has been in the field of preparing ethylene polymers having an intermediate molecular weight distribution and a good balance of physical properties. Such polymers have particular application in the production of sheets and certain articles that are formed by blow molding, e.g., containers for milk, and like other polymers intended for commercial use are desirably prepared by a process which is as economical as possible as well as being capable of producing a polymer having the desired properties. There are, of course, known processes for preparing resins having an intermediate molecular weight distribution by polymerizing ethylene with the aid of Ziegler catalysts. However, the known processes typically suffer one or more of the disadvantages of lack of economy, inability to produce polymers having a suitable balance of properties, and or unreliability in producing such polymers particularly in commercial scale operations. The processes described in Monsanto s GB A 1,489,410 are among such processes. Actually, from the teachings of the patent and what can be learned from repeating its examples, it is apparent that Monsanto s processes were designed for the preparation of blow molding resins having broader molecular weight distributions than are desired for many blow molding resins. However, with the use of technology not taught by Monsanto, the processes can sometimes be manipulated to produce resins having intermediate molecular weight distribution as well, and they appear to be better than many known processes for preparing blow molding ethylene polymers in some respects, e.g. in their use of supported Ziegler catalysts having a vanadium component and in their ability to produce polymers having desirable properties in laboratory scale operations. It has been found, however, that they are unreliable in producing polymers having intermediate molecular weight distributions. Attempts to make Monsanto s processes more reliable in producing polymers having suitable and predictable intermediate molecular weight distributions have heretofore been unsuccessful. Polymers having a variety of molecular weight distributions ranging from broad to narrow have been produced by modifying Monsanto s teachings in various ways, but a tunable variable, i.e., a component that can be varied in a substantially linear way so as to permit the production of polymers having a predictable variety of intermediate molecular weight distribution has not previously been discovered. US A 4,003,712 Miller teaches a gas phase fluidized bed system and process which are capable of being scaled up to commercial size and, being solvent free, would be less expensive than processes which use solvents or liquid diluents. However, Miller s silyl chromate catalyst does not give polymers of the desired molecular weight distribution and good balance of physical properties. His system contains some features which tend to shorten commercial on stream time. He does not teach how to avoid polymer buildup on reactor surfaces, a phenomenon variously referred to as coating , fouling , or sheeting . US A 3,202,645 Yancey presents a process for polymerizing and copolymerizing alpha mono and di olefins by a catalyst composition comprising a the product of the reaction between a compound of a metal chosen from the group consisting of the metals of Group IIb and IIIb where the group numbers correspond to the Mendeleev Periodic Table and hydroxyl groups on the surface of a finely divided particulate inorganic solid, preferably finely divided silica or alumina, and b a halide type compound of a Group IVa, V, VIa, VIIa, or period 4 of Group VIII metal. The polymerization or copolymerization reaction can be effected at suitable temperatures within the range of from about 25 C. to about 250 C., and pressures ranging from below atmospheric upwardly to any desired maximum pressure, for example, 207 MPa gauge 30,000 p.s.i.g. or even higher pressures. US A 3,718,636 Stevens et al teaches obtaining polyolefins having a wide distribution of molecular weights through the use of a catalyst comprising an organometallic compound, and a solid complex component obtained by reacting a solid bivalent metal compound with an impregnation agent which consists of an organometallic compound, separating the solid reaction product, and reacting the solid reaction product with a halogenated derivative of a transition metal. Stevens et al teaches in US A 3,787,384 another catalyst suitable for use in olefin polymerization and olefin copolymerization which comprises US A 4,397,762 Johnstone teaches a supported Ziegler catalyst prepared by the following steps, carried out under anhydrous conditions What is still needed is a process employing a catalyst which a is suitable for use in a gas phase polymerization process, b has sufficient activity to be ecomonically attractive, c contains a tunable variable that permits the production of ethylene polymers having predictable intermediate molecular weight distributions and a good balance of physical properties, d does not cause reactor wall fouling, and e a gas phase fluidized bed process which allows the catalyst to perform at its full potential at commercial scale. US A 4435520 shows a catalyst composition and method of making it as claimed in steps a c of the present claims, and also some of the matter contained in other parts of the present claims but does not provide the combination of process conditions which according to the present invention lead to particularly advantageous results. An object of the invention is to provide an economical commercial polymerization process for preparing ethylene polymers having an intermediate molecular weight distribution and a good balance of physical properties. The foregoing object of this invention is broadly accomplished by providing a process of polymerizing a monomer charge including ethylene comprising the steps of The preparation of the catalyst used in this process is described in US A 4435520 which discusses also various criteria determining the properties of the specific catalysts produced. This invention is a process of polymerizing a monomer charge having ethylene. An inorganic oxide with surface hydroxyl groups is dried to form a support that is substantially free of adsorbed water. The surface hydroxyl groups of the support are reacted with at least about 0.5 mol, per mol of surface hydroxyl groups, of at least one organometallic compound corresponding to the formula R The reaction of the vanadium component with the treated support may also be accomplished by conventional means such as any of the techniques described in GB A 1,489,410. However, it is most desirably accomplished simply by adding the vanadium component in neat or solution form to the slurry of treated support and maintaining it in intimate contact with the treated support for a time sufficient to provide for substantially complete reaction, usually at least about 5 minutes and preferably about 10 60 minutes, although, actually, the reaction is virtually instantaneous. Commercial preparation of the catalyst compositions of this invention is preferably carried out as taught by Rogers in US A 4,426,317. Regardless of the particular technique used to prepare the catalyst compositions of the invention, it should be kept in mind that they are Ziegler catalysts and are therefore susceptible to poisoning by the materials, such as oxygen, water, etc., that are known to reduce or destroy the effectiveness of Ziegler catalysts. Accordingly, they should be prepared, stored, and used under conditions that will permit them to be useful as polymerization catalysts, e.g., by the use of an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen. The invention is particularly advantageous in that it uses catalyst compositions which 1 have the active ingredients chemically attached to an inorganic oxide support, 2 have a tunable variable that makes them capable of producing ethylene polymers having predictable intermediate molecular weight distributions, and a good balance of physical properties by an economical gas phase process that gives a high yield of polymer and 3 do not foul gas phase reactors. The fact that high yields of polymer can be obtained by the use of the catalyst compositions is particularly unexpected in that these high yields are attainable even when the catalyst compositions are prepared by the preferred process wherein no washing step is required or utilized during or after preparation of the compositions. Both experience in the field and the teachings of the prior art indicate that at least one washing step should be required in the preparation of such compositions when high yield catalysts are desired. After the catalyst composition of this invention is prepared, it is subsequently introduce into a gas phase fluidized reactor in a manner similar to that taught for a different catalyst, by Miller in US A Patent No. 4,003,712. In a preferred embodiment the diameter of the velocity reduction or disengaging zone at the top of Miller s reactor is enlarged and the cyclone and filter in the gas recycle system are eliminated for stable, long term commercial operation. It should be understood that polymerization with the catalyst composition of this invention may be conducted in any fluidized system which has a distribution plate means and allows a monomer gas to fluidize a bed including the catalyst compositions allows unreacted monomer gas to be recycled from the top of the fluidized system back to the bottom of the fluidized system or for admixing with the monomer gas prior to its diffusing or passing through the fluidized bed allows a polymer product to be withdrawn from the fluidized bed allows catalyst and a trialkylaluminum to be added to the fluidized bed and provides for the removal of the heat of polymerization. Size, shape, pressure rating, heat removal capability, and other factors can limit the polymer production capacity of the gas phase fluidized bed reaction systems of this invention. The process of this invention may be practiced in commercial facilities having production capacities of 50,000 to 250,000 metric tons per year or more. The process of this invention may also be practiced in laboratory scale reactors having a production capacity of from about 0.1 to 1.0 kg hr or in pilot plant reactors having production capacities of from 5 to 500 kg hr. The catalyst composition is injected or fed to the fluidized bed system at a point between the distribution plate and about 7 8 of the height of the fluidized bed from the distribution plate of the reactor. More preferably, the catalyst composition is fed into the fluidized bed system at a point of between about 1 8 to about 1 2 of the height of the fluidized bed. Injection of the catalyst composition above about 1 8 of the height of the bed as opposed to below 1 8 of the height offers distribution of the catalyst compositions throughout the entire ongoing fluidized bed to retard and or preclude the formation of localized spots of high catalyst composition concentration which would result in the formation of hot spots at or near the distribution plate. A hot spot is a localized region in which the exothermic heat of polymerization is not dissipated before some polymer heats to the softening point of the polymer. Any introduction of the catalyst compositions of this invention at a point above about 7 8 of the height of the fluidized bed from the distribution plate of the reactor may lead to excessive carryover of the fresh catalyst of this invention into the gas recycle system. The rate of injection or rate of feed of the catalyst composition of this invention is any suitable rate which is equal to catalyst consumption in the polymerization process of this invention and generally depends on the size of the fluidized bed system. The rate of production of the particulate polymerized substantially ethylene particles in the fluidized bed is partly determined by the rate of catalyst injection. We have found that the rate of injection of the catalyst for our polymerization process is generally preferably at a rate that maintains the concentration of the vanadium in the fluidized bed between about 0.1 ppm to about 50 ppm based on weight of vanadium metal divided by total solids in the bed. More preferably, the rate of injection of the catalyst is that which would maintain the concentration of vanadium in the fluidized bed between about 0.50 ppm to about 10 ppm most preferably, between about 1 ppm to about 4 ppm the fluidized bed is substantially particulate polymerized ethylene polymer particles formed by polymerization of the monomer s on the catalyst compositions of this invention. In order for the catalyst compositions to give high yield of polymer product per unit of vanadium component. We have discovered that it is necessary to add or inject at least one trialkylaluminum compound into the fluidized bed system as a co catalyst. For a variety of reasons, it is preferred to add the trialkylaluminum compound, or the mixture of trialkylaluminum compounds, that is being used as co catalyst directly to the fluidized bed separately and independently of the catalyst and at an injection point removed from the catalyst injection point. However, the process of this invention does not depend on the method of feeding the trialkylaluminum co catalyst. The trialkylaluminum compounds of this invention may be fed to the fluidized bed as pure compounds, or in solution in a liquid hydrocarbon which will vaporize in the fluidized bed. Suitable hydrocarbon solvent include, but are not limited to, isobutane, isopentane, hexane, heptane, and mixtures thereof. The trialkylaluminum may be any trialkylaluminum wherein the alkyl or combination of alkyl groups contain between 1 and 36 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the alkyl group or combination of alkyl groups contain between 1 and 12 carbon atoms. Suitable trialkylaluminum compounds have been found to include trimethyl , triethyl , tri i butyl , tri n hexyl , tri n octyl and ethyl di i butylaluminum. It should be understood that trialkylaluminum compounds add ethylene, and alpha olefins to some extent, under the operating temperatures and pressures of the polymerization process of the invention. Thus, an ethyl group on aluminum may be inserted by ethylene to become a butyl group, etc. Therefore, there is no reason to believe or require that all alkyl groups on the aluminum be the same. There is every reason to believe that mixtures of trialkylaluminum compounds are generated during polymerization and are as effective as pure compounds. Since the exact composition of the alkyl groups on aluminum during the polymerization process of this invention is not known because of the ethylene insertion reaction, all of the trialkylaluminum species in the fluidized bed are referred to collectively for the purposes herein as trialkylaluminum . As was the case for the catalyst composition the rate of injection of the trialkylaluminum is also any suitable rate which is equal to the trialkylaluminum consumption in the polymerization process, and also depends on the size of the fluidized bed system. Polymer productivity from the polymerization process is not only determined by the rate of catalyst injection, but also from the rate of trialkylaluminum injection. Assuming that the trialkylaluminum compounds of this invention remain in the fluidized bed and assuming uniform distribution of trialkylaluminum throughout the fluidized bed, the molar concentration of trialkylaluminum may be calculated from the molar feed rate of the trialkylaluminum being fed into the fluidized bed reaction system and the withdrawal rate of the polymer product particles. Likewise, assuming uniform distribution of the catalyst composition throughout the fluidized bed, the molar concentration of the vanadium component of the catalyst composition may be calculated from the molar feed rate of the vanadium components of the catalyst composition being fed into the fluidized bed reaction system and the withdrawal rate of the polymer product particles. At stable, lined out operating conditions, the ratio of the molar concentration of the trialkylaluminum to the molar concentration of the vanadium component in the bed of catalyst composition will asymptote to the ratio of the molar feed rate of the trialkylaluminum to the molar feed rate of the vanadium components of the catalyst composition of this invention. For the catalyst compositions of this invention, the injection rate of the trialkylaluminum should be such that the Al V ratio in the fluidized bed of the molar concentration of the trialkylaluminum to the molar concentration of the vanadium component is between about 1 to about 5,000. We have found that the activity of the catalyst composition is maximized in a certain range of trialkylaluminum to vanadium molar ratio. Too little or too much trialkylaluminum suppresses the activity of the catalyst composition and the polymer production. It has been determined that a plot of the trialkylaluminum to vanadium molar ratio versus the catalyst of this invention activity possesses a generally flat peak and the optimum trialkylaluminum to vanadium molar ratio lies in the range of from about 2 to about 500, with from about 2 to 60 being the most preferred from the standpoint of minimizing catalyst residue levels in the polymer and trialkylaluminum cost. Therefore, the preferred injection rate of the trialkylaluminum into the fluidized bed system of this invention is that injection rate wherein the molar ratio in the fluidized bed of the molar concentration of the, trialkylaluminum to the molar concentration of the vanadium composition is between about 2 to 500, and most preferably from about 2 to about 60. The bed of particulate polymerized substantially ethylene particles, trialkylaluminum and the catalyst composition has to be fluidized at a pressure of between about 0.7 and 4.2 MPa and a temperature of between about 50 to 120 C. Fluidization is conducted by diffusing underneath the bed and through the distribution plate a gas mixture comprising ethylene, hydrogen and chloroform at a rate sufficient enough to give a linear gas velocity in the bed of between about 15 to about 60 cm sec. The gas mixture will also include inert gas which is used to feed the catalyst compositions to the fluidized bed. A majority of the gas mixture is in the form of unreacted gas mixture that is recycled from the top of the reaction zone to the bottom of the fluidized bed of the reaction zone. Although the catalyst compositions and the trialkylaluminum polymerize ethylene and other olefins over a wide range of temperatures, there is a practical limitation to the temperatures at which the gas phase fluidized bed process of this invention is commercially viable. For example, above about 120 C, ethylene polymers soften and tend to agglomerate in a fluidized bed, leading to formation of lumps, loss of fluidization, and onset of an inoperable condition. Below about 50 C, the production rate of commercial reactors becomes so low that the process is no longer profitable. It is generally desirable to operate near the highest temperature at which the polymer will not agglomerate in the bed with a temperature safety factor for small temperature upsets so that inoperable conditions ore not encountered even briefly. Therefore, the preferred temperature range is from about 65 115 C, with the range from about 75 110 C being most preferred. The pressure at which the polymerization process of this invention is conducted is selected on the basis of desired commercial operation rather than upon some limitation of the catalyst. The catalysts of this invention will function at atmospheric, subatmospheric, or superatmospheric pressures. For economy of operation, one wishes to polymerize near the highest pressure for which the equipment is designed in order to maximize the production rate for the equipment. But, because commercial process equipment generally is more expensive with the higher pressure, there is a natural tendency to design commercial equipment for low pressures. These constraints lead to a commercial operating range of about 0.7 4.2 MPa. At the lower pressures, however, higher dwell or residence times in the reactor are required to reach high yields of polymer per unit of catalyst. At the higher pressures, there is little room to safely accommodate pressure upsets. These constraints lead to a preferred pressure range of about 1.6 3.9 MPa. In order to provide sufficient mixing and agitation in the bed of polymer particles, trialkylaluminum and catalyst such that hot spots The present catalysts under the commercial conditions described above, in the absence of a chain transfer agent, produce polymer of a molecular weight too high for conventional melt processing. Therefore, in the commercial practice of this invention the fluidizing gas mixture must contain hydrogen during polymerization to adjust the molecular weight as determined by melt index to the desired range for the product being produced. This is done by increasing the hydrogen ethylene ratio to raise melt index lower molecular weight , or reducing the ratio to produce the opposite effect. The catalyst compositions of this invention are moderately sensitive to hydrogen, so it is generally not necessary to use more than 20 by vol. of hydrogen even to produce the highest melt index polymer. Furthermore, when used as described herein, altering the hydrogen ethylene ratio to increase melt index does not cause a loss of production rate in a commercial plant within the range of melt indexes used for commercial polymers at this time. Preferably, the amount of hydrogen utilized in a preferred embodiment of the invention in order to control the molecular weight of the produced polymer is between about 0.10 to about 20.0 by volume of the total gas mixture volume. The gas mixture has to have chloroform in order that the catalyst compositions of this invention can have their activity promoted. While other halogenated carbon compounds such as methylene chloride and fluorotrichroromethane may work as promoters, from the standpoints of promotion of catalyst activity, cost, availability, ease of handling, and catalyst promotion without causing reactor fouling, chloroform is clearly the compound of choice. Only small amounts are needed because of its effectiveness. Under the conditions of polymerization, it is a gas, and generally will be present in the recycle gas at concentrations between about 0.0001 to about 1.000 by vol of the gas mixture. Since the preferred vol ranges for hydrogen and chloroform are respectively between about 0.10 and about 20.0 and between about 0.0001 and about 1.000 the remaining vol for any given volume of the gas mixture would include ethylene and any of the inert gas which is used to feed the catalyst compositions to the fluidized bed in the reaction zone. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, ethylene preferably comprises between about 50.0 vol and about 99.9 vol of the gas mixture. It appears that the molar ratio CHCl₃ V is more useful in predicting and understanding its effect than the overall concentration in the gas, since it affects the catalyst s performance. The CHCl₃ V ratio may vary from about 2 to about 5000. Because chloroform is relatively inexpensive and used in small amounts, there is no real economic incentive to minimize its use. However, there appears to be a maximum in the curve of catalyst activity vs. CHCl₃ V ratio, with a broad optimum in the range of about 10 500. There also appears to be an interaction between the optima for CHCl₃ V ratio and Al V ratio such that lower CHCl₃ V ratios are generally preferred when the Al V ratio is low, and higher CHCl₃ V ratios are generally preferred when the Al V is high. Other factors, such as impurity levels, may also cause a shift in the optimum CHCl₃ V ratio or Al V ratio, but generally such factors will not shift the optima outside the preferred ranges. We have found that, in order to control the density of the produced ethylene polymer, the gas mixture of ethylene, hydrogen and chloroform may include alpha olefins which will be copolymerized with the ethylene of the gas mixture. Although the catalyst compositions of this invention will copolymerize essentially any alpha olefin with ethylene, there is a practical limit to what can be effectively done in a gas phase reaction. Generally, olefins having more than 8 carbon atoms have too low a vapor pressure to be used in high enough concentration to have much effect on density. Propylene, butene 1, hexene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, and octene 1 are among the alpha olefins useful in copolymerization with ethylene in this invention. Preferably, mixtures of alpha olefins having 3 to 8 carbon atoms are used in a preferred embodiment of this invention. By this process, polymers generally considered to be HDPE densities of 0.940 or greater and LLDPE densities below 0.940 may be made equally well by adjusting comonomer concentration in the feed or other factors. The amount of comonomer needed is determined by the density of the polymer product being made. Generally, not less than 0.5 vol of alpha olefin will be used and not more than 30 vol of the alpha olefin will be utilized for any given volume of the gas mixture along with any of the inert gas and between about 0.10 vol and about 20.0 vol of hydrogen, between about 0.0001 vol and about 1.000 vol chloroform, and between about 50.0 vol and about 99.4 vol ethylene. The catalyst compositions of this invention are preferably fed to the gas phase fluidized bed reactor as a dry particulate matter, such as dry powder, under the inert gas. Any gas that does not react with the catalyst is considered inert. Suitable inert gases include nitrogen, argon, and methane. Any device which can measure and convey a free flowing powder is suitable for feeding the catalyst, although the device must not allow monomer to enter the catalyst storage area of the feed device. Once the catalyst has been measured and delivered to the catalyst feed line, any good method of conveying it to the fluidized bed may be used. These include mechanical means such as screw conveyers, or gas conveying with inert gas or, as Miller teaches, with recycle gas from the reactor. Catalyst may be added continuously, semi continuously, or discontinuously to the reactor. Continuous addition is preferred, but is virtually impossible at laboratory scale. Catalyst may be fed pure or may be diluted with any free flowing particulate material such as pure, dry support or polymer powder from the reactor. In catalyst feeding, all that is really critical is that the catalyst be fed at a controlled rate and be dispersed in the bed before a hot spot develops. The produced particulate polymerized substantially ethylene particles may be removed from the gas phase reaction zone at any suitable location. Preferably, the produced ethylene polymer particles are removed in accordance with the procedure described by Miller in US A 4,003,712. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the produced ethylene polymer particles are removed from the gas phase reaction zone above and in proximity to the distribution plate. As has been mentioned, it is necessary to have good fluidization, good catalyst mixing, and good distribution of gas in the bed in order to avoid hot spots which cause lumps to form in the bed. These lumps themselves disturb fluidization so, once a lump forms, the tendancy for other lumps to form is enhanced. Eventually a reactor shut down is necessary because the process becomes inoperable. Similarly, it is necessary for long term, stable operation of commercial reactors that the surfaces of the reactor and distribution plate remain clean. If a polymer coating fouling builds up on a reactor surface, several undesirable things may happen. First, fouling on the distribution plate tends to perturb the desired gas distribution and restrict the ability to the polymer particles at the plate to move laterally. Both effects tend to produce hot spots at or near the distribution plate. Second, fouling on the reactor wall inhibits the normal downward motion of fluidized particles at the wall surface. Particles which hang up at a wall surface can generate hot spots . Third, the wall coating may come loose in places, fall into the bed, and disrupt fluidization as any lump would do. Even worse, wall fouling usually is in the form of a sheet rather than a lump, and produces severe gas channelling in the bed if it falls off. Although poor selection of operating conditions or poor operating techniques may lead to lump formation, it appears that fouling of reactor surfaces depends primarily on the catalyst used. Some catalysts tend to produce fouling,and some do not. At this time, insufficient experience has been gained to be able to predict with accuracy which catalysts will foul and which will give stable operation for months without fouling reactor surfaces. Obviously, for economical commercial operation, the catalyst must not foul reactor surfaces. Fouling in a commercial reactor leads to down time with consequent loss of production and extra maintenance cost for cleaning. Thus, fouling will cause a gas phase fluidized bed process to lose its economic advantage over slurry processes. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention and are not intended as a limitation thereof. In these examples, compositions and processes that are illustrative of the invention are distinguished from those that are outside the scope of the invention and are included only for comparative purposes by using an alphabetic designation for any example or run that is a comparative example and a numeric designation for the examples and runs that are illustrative of the invention. Yields given in the examples are measures of productivity in terms of the number of grams of polymer produced per gram of catalyst per hour, melt indices MI₂ are those determined by ASTM test D 1238 65T using a 2160 gram weight, while the NVR values are normalized melt viscosity ratios determined by measuring the apparent viscosities of the polymers at 30 sec ¹ and 300 sec. ¹, respectively, at 200 C. in an Instron capillary rheometer and 2 normalizing them to V₃₀ 5 by the equation. In the examples, the following procedures are used to prepare the catalyst compositions and polymers. In the preparation of each of the catalysts, dry Davison 952 silica gel a commercial inorganic oxide having a surface area of about 250 350 square meters per gram, a pore volume of about 1.5 1.7 cm³ per gram, and an average particle size of about 65 75 µm microns by heating it under dry, deoxygenated nitrogen for about 16 hours at a temperature of about 225 275 C. to provide an activated oxide containing about 1.4 mmols of available hydroxyl groups per gram. Cool the activated oxide to ambient temperature under a purified nitrogen blanket, suspend it in commercial hexane, add neat trialkylaluminum, and stir the resultant slurry for about 30 minutes. Then add a vanadium component in neat or solution form, stir the resultant slurry for an additional 30 minutes, allow the hexane and catalyst layers to separate, decant the clear hexane layer, and remove the remaining hexane under a nitrogen purge to produce a powdered catalyst. The particular ingredients used to prepare the catalysts and the amounts of trialkylaluminum and vanadium compounds added per gram of inorganic oxide are shown in the examples and or tables. The laboratory apparatus consisted of a continuous polymerization reaction system essentially as depicted by Miller in the drawing of US A 4,003,712, with two exceptions there was no filter in the gas recycle line, and the catalyst was fed to the reactor with nitrogen only. The reaction zone itself was 10 cm in diameter, 120 cm tall. Recycle gas passed through a velocity reduction or disengaging zone atop the reactor, through a cyclone separator, through a centrifugal compressor, and into the bottom of the reactor where the gas was distributed into the fluidized bed by a dispersion or distribution plate. Heat exchange was effected by circulating pressurized, tempered water through jacketing on the recycle gas piping. This system had a rated capacity of 450 g of polymer per hour. Generally, for catalyst screening studies, the system was operated as follows Introduce a stream or streams of ethylene, any comonomer s , chloroform, and hydrogen to the reactor. Continuously withdraw unreacted or recycle gas from the top of the disengaging zone, pass it through a heat exchanger to maintain a bed temperature of about 95 100 C., and introduce it at the bottom of the reactor at a rate sufficient to give a superficial velocity of about 25 cm sec in the bed. Introduce make up monomer, chloroform, and hydrogen into the recycle gas line so as to maintain constant gas composition as detected by on line analyzers and so as to maintain the reactor pressure at about 3.5 MPa and to provide about 40 mmols of chloroform per mmol of vanadium per hour, and feed fresh catalyst particles into the reactor below the top of the bed so as to provide a vanadium feed rate of one mmol per hour. Add triethylaluminum as a scavenger and co catalyst during the polymerization so as to provide a triethylaluminum feed rate of 20 mmol per hour. Withdraw polymer product semi continuously from the bottom of the bed at a rate such as to maintain a constant bed level. Take aliquots of withdrawn polymer for testing. A batch of catalyst having the composition VC1₄ 0.05mM VOC1₃ A1 C₂H₅ ₃ SiO₂ 0.05mM 1.4mM 1g is prepared as a dry powder according to Rogers, US A 4,426,317, and used in the laboratory gas phase polymerization procedure described above, using ethylene as the only monomer. By adjusting concentrations of hydrogen and chloroform, and feed rates of catalyst and a 3 solution of triethylaluminum co catalyst in hexane, the reaction and polymer properties stablize after 36 hours of continuous operation to give 350 g hr of polyethylene product of 0.7 melt index and an NVR of 2.6. After stability has been reached, the hydrogen feed is discontinued. Gradually, the hydrogen ethylene ratio drops, as determined by an on line gas analyzer, as recycle gases are lost from the reaction zone through purge to the instruments and by being removed with the polyethylene product and no fresh hydrogen is added to the make up gases. As the hydrogen level in the recycle gas decreases, the polymer melt index drops until it is unmeasurably low. The polymerization rate, as determined by ethylene uptake and by product removal from the reaction zone is unchanged, within experimental error. There is no external evidence of fouling. Hydrogen flow is then restarted, and the original hydrogen ethylene ratio re established. Within 18 hours, the melt index is again 0.7. With the reactor restabilized, the chloroform feed is discontinued. Gradually, the CHCl₃ V ratio decreases as the CHCl₃ promotor concentration in the recycle gas becomes lower due to loss of recycle gas from the system and the make up gas being promoter free. There is no change in the melt index of the polymer, but the polymerization rate drops to less than 100 g hr. The chloroform feed is restarted at its original feed rate. Polymerization rate picks up immediately, as judged from an increase in both bed temperature and polymer powder production, and reaches a level of about 550 g hr, after which the rate declines. About 36 hours after chloroform is readmitted to the reaction, the reactor and polymer are restablized to the original conditions of 350 g hr rate and 0.7 melt index. Then the triethylaluminum feed is stopped. The polymerization rate begins to decrease, slowly at first, and then rapidly. When the polymerization rate reaches about 100 g hr, the triethylaluminum feed is restarted at the original rate. Within an hour, an increase in polymer production can be noted, and within about 24 hours the reaction is restabilized at the original condition. The reaction is then terminated intentionally, and the reactor opened for inspection. There is no visible coating or fouling on the distribution plate or reactor walls. A gas phase fluidized bed pilot plant polymerization system, similar in design to the previously described laboratory gas phase system was built. There was no separator in the gas recycle system, however. The reaction zone was 46 cm in diameter and about 3 m tall. The reactor was topped by a disengaging zone of 92 cm diameter. Gas recycle piping led from the disengaging zone through a heat exchanger and recycle gas blower to the bottom of the reactor. A distribution plate at the bottom of the reactor served to disperse or distribute the gas evenly at the bottom of the bed. Gas analyzers monitored the gas composition of the recycle system, and via suitable instrumentation, automatically adjusted flows of feed streams to keep the composition constant. Catalyst was fed directly to the bed with an automatic catalyst feeder using nitrogen as the motive gas to convey the catalyst into the bed. Triethylaluminum TEA was pumped directly into the bed. Polymer powder was automatically withdrawn to maintain a constant inventory of powder in the reactor. A run was carried out at a reaction pressure of about 3.5 MPa, an average bed temperature of about 93 degrees C, and a recycle gas rate of about 4525 kg hr, to give a gas velocity in the bed of about 30 cm sec. The catalyst had the composition VOC1₃ A1 C₂H₅ ₃ SiO₂ 0.1mM 0.8mM 1g and was made according to US A 4,426,317 Rogers . With a gas composition consisting essentially of about 84 ethylene, more than 6 hydrogen, and more than 9 nitrogen, and with the catalyst triethylaluminum neat , and chloroform feed rates stabilized at about 20, about 3, and about 5 cm³ hr, respectively, about 11 kg hr of a brood molecular weight distribution polymer NVR about 2.7 was produced. Attempts to blow mold milk bottles from the product were unsuccessful because the molecular weight distribution of the polymer was too broad for use in conventional milk bottle fabricating equipment. When the catalyst of Example I is substituted on the fly following collection of the sample of Example A, and such minor adjustments in gas composition made as required to line out with this catalyst at about the same yield and with a melt index of 0.8, the polymer product has an NVR of 2.55 2.60 and readily processes into milk bottles on conventional equipment. There is no evidence of reactor fouling. An attempt was made to essentially repeat Example III of US A 4,232,140 using the laboratory gas phase polymerization method described above with Ort s catalyst and CFCl₃ promoter, operating the equipment continuously 24 hours a day. After two days, and before the reaction had lined out sufficiently to get a good sample of the desired product for comparison with the products made by the catalysts of this invention, the reactor became inoperable. After the reaction system had been shut down, the reactor was opened. The reactor walls and distribution plate were found to be fouled coated with polymer to the extent that normal fluidization could not be maintained. The reactor was thoroughly cleaned, and the attempt repeated. This time, the reactor fouled out in about one day. A third attempt to run this catalyst and CFCl₃ promoter on a continuous basis was similarly unsuccessful. This example shows that long term operability of a gas phase fluidized bed depends upon proper choice of catalyst and promoter. A commercial gas phase fluidized bed polymerization is carried out in a polymerization system in which the reaction zone is 3.6 m in diameter and about 15 m tall. Recycle gas rate is sufficient to give a gas velocity in the bed of about 30 cm sec. The polymerization is conducted at 3.5 MPa pressure and 93 degrees C average bed temperature. The catalyst has the same formulation as in Examples I, but is made in commercial batches of 450 kg each. The polymer, produced at a rate of about 8.5 metric tons per hour, from a recycle gas consisting essentially of ethylene, hydrogen, nitrogen, and chloroform, is a blow molding grad, has an average melt index of 0.8, an average density of 0.964, and an NVR of 2.60 plus or minus 0.05. The product, after compounding with suitable stabilizers, is easily blown into commercially acceptable 1 gallon milk bottles on conventional milk bottle blowing equipment. After a 1 month campaign producing this product, there is no evidence of reactor fouling. Similar results in the narrowing of the molecular weight distribution of ethylene polymers are obtained when the examples are repeated except that the catalyst components, component proportions, comonomers, comonomer proportions, and or polymerization conditions specified in the examples are replaced with other catalyst components, component proportions, comonomers, comomoner proportions, and or polymerization conditions taught to be their equivalent in the specification.
