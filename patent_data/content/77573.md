# Rail apparatus around nuclear reactor pressure vessel and method of installing the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for installing a rail apparatus and a rail apparatus for running an automatic ultrasonic flaw detector around a reactor pressure vessel 1 for detecting any flaw in the weld beads 12, 13 on the reactor pressure vessel. At least two circumferential rails 221 224 and vertical rails 231 234 are connected through turn tables 241 244 at their crossing points to form a rail unit. The rail unit has vertical rails 231, 233 extending upward from the uppermost circumferential rail. The vertical rails are secured to a gamma shield 20 so that the rail unit as a whole is suspended from the gamma shield 20 by means of these vertical rails. The rail unit is provided with swing prevention devices 28 for preventing swing thereof. In installation of the rail apparatus, the rail unit is temporarily mounted to the reactor pressure vessel before mounting the latter into a containment vessel. Then after placing the reactor pressure vessel together with the rail unit in a right place within the containment vessel, the rail unit is sup ported suitably by the gamma shield.
