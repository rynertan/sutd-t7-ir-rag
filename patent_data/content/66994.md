# PRODUCTION AND USE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
The genetic modification of microorganisms which can be grown upon methanol as a carbon source to produce single cell protein SCP . By the modification the genes specifying the methanol oxidase MO and methanol dehydrogenase MDH enzymes, used in the normal metabolic pathways by which the microorganisms convert methanol to formaldehyde, are replaced by adh genes capable of expressing an alcohol dehydrogenase ADH enzyme catalyst for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The modified microorganism has increased energetic efficiency in utilizing carbon. Preferably the modified microorganism is derived from Methylophilus me thylotrophus. The claims cover genetically modified microor ganisms a method of making genetically modified microorga nisms and a process for the production of single cell protein.
