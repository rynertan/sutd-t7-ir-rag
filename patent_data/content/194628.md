# Double drum type continuous casting machine.

## Abstract
A continuous casting machine including a container 1 for accommodating a molten metal 7 and a nozzle 2 for supplying the molten metal 7 from the container 1 . A pair of rotating rolls 3,4 cools the molten metal 7 to form a solidified shell 8,9 on the surface thereof and compresses the solidified shells 8,9 to produce a metal sheet 10 . A number of bearing boxes 11,12 is disposed in a housing 14 for rotatably supporting the respective ends of the rolls 3,4 , and a rigid member 32,33 is disposed between the bearing boxes 11,12 in the housing 14 . A prestress or initial force is applied to the rigid member 30 through the bearing box 12 and a controller 100 regulates the rotating speed of a drive means 27 in order to control the separating force P occurring at a compression of the solidified shells 8,9 by the rolls 3,4 . By controlling the separating force P , a leakage of the molten metal 7 is prevented and a sheet metal 10 having a uniform thickness is continuously obtained.
