It will be understood that, since the carbon atom bearing substituents R1 and hydroxy maybe asymmetrically substituted, the compounds of the invention may exist in racemic or optically active forms. It is common general knowledge in the art how such forms may be separated and isolated, and their antifungal properties determined. The compounds of the formula II may be prepared by methods known generally for the manufacture of similar compounds. Thus, the following processes are provided as further features of this invention, wherein X,Y,R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings defined above, unless otherwise stated a the reaction of an epoxide of the formula III wherein R4 is a radical of the formula IV, either as such or formed in situ, with an azole of the formula V in the presence of a strong base or b the reaction of a ketone of the formula VI with either a Grignard reagent, R1 Mgflal, wherein Hal is a halogen or an aryl lithium derivative, R1Li or c the reaction of a ketone of the formula VII wherein R4 is a radical of the formula IV with a reagent of the formula VIII wherein R5 is a radical of the formula IX and Q is a triphenylphosphine halide Hal .Ph3P or dialkyl phosphite R90 2Po , wherein R9 is 1 6C lower alkyl2 radical, which reagent may be preformed or formed in situ or d the chlorination or bromination of a compound of the formula II wherein R2 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom, and X and Y are each nitrilo. The epoxide of the formula III which is used as a starting material in the above process a may be obtained by bromination of an appropriately substituted acetophenone X to give the corresponding phenacyl bromide XI, which is then reacted with an appropriate azole, IV, for example in acetonitrile in thepresence of triethylamine at room temperature, to form an azolyl ketone of the formula VII.

The preparation of the ketone VII used as starting material in process c , is described above as an intermediate step in the manufacture of the epoxide starting material III. Process d is preferably carried out by reacting the unsubstituted azole starting material withN chloro or N bromo succinimide in an inert solvent, for example in chloroform or carbon tetrachloride at reflux temperature for about 2 days, when the major product is the compound of the formula II bearing a halogen substituent in the 5 position of one 1,2,4 triazole ring only. The Wittig reagent of the formula VIII used as starting.materiaiinthe above process c , may be manufactured by reacting l chloromethyl 1,2,4 triazole with either triphenylphosphine, as described in EuropeanPatent Publication No. 60222, or with potassium diethyl phosphite. As indicated above, the compounds of the invention possess antifungal properties which make them useful in the treatment of candidosis and human dermatophyte infections. This antifungal activity against Candida albicans, a causative fungus of candidosis, andTrichophyton mentagrophytes, var. quinkeanum,a causative fungus of ringworm, was demonstrated as follows Female mice of around 30g. weight are injected sub cutaneously on a Friday with 0.5mg. of oestradiol benzoate. The following Monday day 0 they are clipped on the back and then dosed orally with test compounds. They are then inoculated with Candida albicans in the vagina and Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. quinkeanum on the back, and then given a second dose of the same compound. Dosing is repeated once daily on days 1 4. On day 7 skin lesions are scored visually and vaginal samples taken for culture on agar.Groups of 5 mice are used and compounds are dosed initially at a level of 250mg. kg. The dose is then reduced sequentially until a minimum effective dose MED is found. For example, the MED for 1 3 bromo 1,2,4 triazol 2 yl 2 2,4 difluorophenyl 3 1,2,4 triazol 2 yl propan 2 ol in this test was 2.5 mg. per kg., and no overt toxicity was seen at this MED. Thus, according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary antifungal composition which comprises an antifungally effective amount of compound of the formulaII together with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition of the invention may be in a conventional pharmaceutical form suitable for oral administration, for example a tablet, a capsule, an emulsion or an aqueous or oily solution or suspension, or suitable for topical application, for example a cream, ointment or gel The composition may contain conventional pharmaceutical excipients, and may be manufactured by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Preferred pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions of the invention are compositions suitable for oral administration, and particularly tablets and capsules containing from I to 100, preferably 5 to 50mg.of a compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention also possess antifungal properties which are useful in combatting a wide variety of plant fungal diseases. The compounds can move acropetally when applied to the plant tissue, and can also be volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against fungi on the plant. The compounds may be used as such for plant fungicidal purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also a plant fungicidal composition comprising a compound of general formula II and a non pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combatting fungal diseases in a plant, which method comprising applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a compound of the formula II. The compound can be applied in a number of ways, for example it can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, to seeds or to the medium in which plants are growing or are to be planted, or it can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or it can be applied as a vapour. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged, and the choice of a suitable conventional composition, and the method by which such a composition may be manufactured, are apparent to those skilled in the art. The plant fungicidal compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, e.g. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or compounds having plant growth regulating, hericidal or insecticidal activity. by the following Examples, in which temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.Erample 1 A solution of 3 bromo 1 12,4 difluorophenacyl 1,2, 4 triazole 4.65 g. , trimethyloxosulphonium iodide 4.0 g. , 1,2,4 triazole 1.5 g. and potassium hydroxide 2.1 g. in tert butyl alcohol 75 ml. was heated under reflux for 6 hours, cooled and partitioned between 0.1N hydrochloric acid and ethyl acetate.
