# Flexible electrochemical heater.

## Abstract
This invention is for an inexpensive flexible heater mater ial heat pad for food heating, medical compresses and the like. The heat pad is a composite material consisting of a supercorroding metallic alloy powder dispersedthroughout a porous polyethylene matrix. The supercorroding alloy mater ial consists of a powdered alloy of magnesium and iron which is produced by high energy powder metallurgical milling techniques. Pressureless sintering of a mixture of the super corroding alloy powders with UHMW polyethylene powder results in the formation of a flexible porous matrix material with active ingredients therein that are readily activated with a suitable electrolyte fluid.
