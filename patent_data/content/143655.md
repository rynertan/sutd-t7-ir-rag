# Process for the preparation of perfluoroalkene oxides.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of perfluoro propene oxide by the reaction of perfluoropropene with hydro gen peroxide in an aqueous alkaline medium, when the reaction is conducted in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst selected from quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts and lipophilic complexing agents for cations, and wherein the alkalinization of the reaction mixture is carried out in a gradual way so as to maintain the reaction temperature constant at a value from 10 C to 60 C.
