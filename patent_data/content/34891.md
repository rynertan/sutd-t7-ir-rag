# Wiring harnesses.

## Abstract
A wiring harness consists of a flexible extruded elongate plastics casing defining a number of side by side passages. The casing is open preferably by slitting along the length of the passages, each of which contains an insulated electrical conductor. Conductors can be egressed out of their passages at predetermined locations and are secured in such projected condition by, for example, adhesive tape applied to the casing upstream and downstream of said location.

## Description
WIRING HARNESSES This invention relates to wiring harnesses especially but not exclusively For use in vehicules. wiring at object of the present invention is to provide a harness of simple construction which is casy to instal and in which the mechanical strength and abrasion resistance of the electrical conductors is improved. According to the invention there is provided a wiring harness especially but not exclusively for use in vehicles, the wiring harness comprising an elongate casing of insulating material defining a plurality of side by side passages with at least some open lengthwise, electrical conductors housed in at least some of said passages with at least on such conductor projecting out of its passage intermediate the ends of the elongate casing, and means for securing said conductor in said projecting position. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a fragmentary perspective view of a wiring harness according to the invention Fig. 2 is a general perspective view of the wiring harness of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a fragmentary perspective view of the wiring, arness of F . 2 showing a multiple conductor projection Fig. 4 is an end elevation of a modified form of wiring harness Fig. 5 is a perspective viw of another modified form of wiring harness Figs. 6 to 9 are perspective views of different conductor insertion tools and Fig. 10 is a perspective view of a multiple conductor insertion tool. Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the wiring harness comprises a flexible protective casing in formed by extrusion and defining a number of intercunnected side by side passages ii of generally tubular form slit lengthuiso as indicated at 12. The slitting is preferably effected immediately after the extrusion operation but may be later depending upon which is most convenient. The tubular passages 11 may all be of the same diameter or there may be different diametral sizes. It is envisaged that one o more tubular passages may hot be slit especially if it is intended not to contain an electrical conductor within such passage. Generally, however, each tubular passage 11 contains an insulated electrical conductor 13. It is envisaged that one or more of the electrical conductors 13 may be bare wire, the necessary insulatIon being provided by the casing 10. The wiring harness has lateral branches constituted by individual conductors 13 see Fig. 2 or a group of conductors 13 isles Fig. 3 . These branches ere provided by extracting the conductor or conductors 13 out of thp tubular passages 11 at the appropriate location and securing the conductor of conductors 13 in pro acted position by suitable means, usually strips 14 of adhesive tape applied to the casing 10 upstream and downstream of the conductor or conductors 13. It will be manifest that the projected conductor or conductors may be secured in exposed position by suitable clips or by binding wrapped around the casing 10. Where there is multiple conductor projection seeFig. 3 it is preferrec that the conductors 13 be contained in a casing 15 of the same construction as the casing 10. Appropriate connectors such, for example, as 16 are fitted to the ends of the conductors 13. It will be manifest that not every tubular passage 11 need contain a conductor 13. It should be noted that the wiring harness can be stepped for example as shown in Fig. 2 so that it is of varying length across its width. The stepping need not be regular as shown. For example, it may be stepped inwardly of its lateral edges. Also the harness may if necessary be split longitudinally for part of its length. The conductors 13 are rolled into their respective tubular passages 11 by a convenient tool which ploughs open the slit 12 and rolls the conductor 13 lengthwise intn ths passe ge 11 which then closes around the conductor 13. Examples of such conductor insertion tools are illustrated In Figs. 6 to 10. In Fig. 6, the tool 17 is formed from 2 strip of relatively rigid plastics material of channel crosssection configured at its bottom to define a tee b and having a cut out 19 in the heel of the tool 17. A conductor 13 lies within the channel and egresses through the cut out 19. The toe 18 of the tool 17 is inserted into a tubular massage 11 and the tool 1 pulled along same opening the slit. 12 and laying the conductor 13 in the passage 11. In Fig. 7, the tool 20 has a handle 21 having at one end a laying head 22 which includes a guIde pln 23 secured to a chamfered or inclined edge 24. The head 22 has a guide slot 25 of the conductor 13 its bottom is recessed as indicatrd at 2G. The pin 23 is inserted into a tubular passage 11 and by pulling the tool 20 along the latter the laying head 22 opens the slit 12 and lays the conductor 13 guided by slot 25 and recess 26 in the passage. The tool 27 of Fig. 8 has a pulling handle 2 with a leading slit opening toe 29 and to its rear a passage 30 open via a slot 31 through which a conductor 13 is inserted into the passage 30. The operation of this tool 27 is the same as tools 17 and 20. Fig. 9 shows a tool 32 for laying larger diameter conductors than those laid with tools 17. 20 and 27., and comprises a tubular handle 33 open along its length by siot 34 and tapering at its operative Bnd as indicated at 35. A plastics pipe 37 split at 36 to give flexibility is fitted in the tapered bottom end of or the handle 33. The pipe 37 serves to open the slit 12 as the tool 32 is pulled along a passage 11. Finally, Fig. 10 shows a tool 39 for multiple conductor insertion which has a top plate 40 hinged to a flat base 41 and 42. The top plate 40 has slit opening teeth 43 and holes 44 for passage of conductors 13. In use, the casing 10 is inserted between the base 41 and top plate 40 with a tooth 43 in each slit 12 and 2 conductor 13 through each hole 44. Relative movement between the casing 10 and the tool 39 causes opening of the slits and laying of the conductors 13 into the passages 11. When being fitted into a vehicle the wiring harness is subject to bending and twisting to allow it to be disposed correctly in the vehicle and the protective casing 10 serves to give mechanical strength and abrasion resistance to the conductors 13. During bending or twisting the conductors 13 do not egress from their tubular passages 13, thers being a rolling action of the passage walls around the conductors 13 in the manner of bearings. Fig. 4 shows a plastics casing 45 having two rows 45,47 of tubular passages 48, each slit as indicated at 49. A conductor is indicated at 50. As can be seen the slits 49 are on onposed faces of the casing 45. Referring finally to Fig. 5, the protective casing 51 is constituted by a body 52 of indefinite length which can be cut to size and which is formed of plastics material, preferably a relatively rigid plastics material. The body 52 is configured to provide a series of side by side recesses 53 for accommodatino electrical conductors not shown , adjacent recesses 12 being separated by a wall 54. The two lateral edges 55 are configured to provide one half of a snap fitting. Conductors 56 are press fitted into the recesses 53 and are retained in place by the curvature of the recess wall. Conductors 55 projected out of their recesses 53 are secured in extracted position by flexible plastics straps 57 having at each end a wing 58 configured to snap engage e lateral wall 55 of the casing 51. It will be manifest that the conductors 56 lie well within the recesses 53 and are therefore given mechanical strength and are protected against abrasion. A passage 11, 48or or rscess 5 3 may contain more than one conductor. The straps 57 may be replaced by adhesive tapo, binding material or clips. In the Fig. 5 embodiment, projecting multiple conductors may be housed in a casing such as casinc 51 or casing 10.
