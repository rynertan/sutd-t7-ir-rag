## Description
The present invention relates to the use of a compound containing glycyl l histidyl 1 lysine copper II , for the manufacture of a medicament for healing wounds. Mechanisms of wound healing and tissue repair in humans and in other mammals are often inadequate and incomplete. Wound healing is often substantially impaired in the elderly, in cancer patients after chemotherapy or radiation treatments, in persons with diabetes, and in individuals suffering from severe burns. The lesions caused by auto immune diseases, such as Krohn s disease or osteoarthritis, are also characterized by slow and deficient healing. In general, poorly healed wounds are characterized by necrotic regions which rapidly become infected, causing pain and suffering to the person and requiring additional medical treatment. Even when such wounds finally heal, the wound area is often devoid or the ability to respond to tactile stimulus, and is often filled with excessive deposits of collagen that lead to uncleared scarring. Wound healing is a highly precise biological process initially exemplified by an invasion of cells of the immunological system and fibroblastic cells which secrete the structural protein collagen into the wounded area. Later, blood and lymphatic vessels reform, and nerve axons infiltrate the wound area. A currently incomplete understanding of the biological processes regulating the healing process is reflected by the relative inadequacy of present treatment methods. Current methods of treatment of wounds include the use of a type of nerve growth factor to accelerate the wound healing process U.S. Patent No. 4,287,184 , a mixture of albumin freed cap serum and vasodilatory peptides kinins U.S. Patent No. 4,177,261 , and the use of partially digested bovine casein, polyvinyl pyrrolidine and carrageenan as a healing aid U.S. Patent No. 3,558,770 . Other treatments include the use of emulsified aqueous mixtures of bovine gelatin, sucrose, corn syrup, oatmeal, and other salts in order to provide a protective covering for wounds, as in U.S. Patent No. 3,767,784, and the use of egg shell membrane products, as in U.S. Patent No. 3,194,732. With regard to all of the above cited wound healing formulations, immunological considerations suggest that the foreignness of the components in these formulations would most likely elicit an antibody recognition and subsequent inflammatory response in any animal except the donor species. In hypersensitive or allergic animals or human patients, such responses can often be lethal. The most promising compositions to date which have proven to accelerate the healing of a wide variety of wounds and tissue injury are a class of compounds called superoxide dismutases, compounds that possess a biochemical ability to detoxify a highly reactive tissue damaging oxygen radical called superoxide anion. The healing of many types of traumatic tissue damage and of aging associated degenerative conditions is delayed by the excessive production of superoxide anion. After wounding or dramatic tissue injury, cells of the immune system invade the damaged area and secrete copious quantities of toxic oxygen radicals to kill invading bacteria. In a similar manner, in auto immune diseases, the immunological cells also secrete oxygen radicals into the afflicted area, ostensibly to kill infective organisms, and thereby induce tissue damage and localized inflammation. Often in cases of impaired healing, the production of superoxide anion further damages tissues and brings in a new influx of immunological cells, thereby creating a vicious circle of damaging events which can greatly delay the normal sequence within the healing process. To obtain proper healing of damaged tissue, it is generally necessary to terminate the production of superoxide anion in the afflicted area. A number of biological and synthetic molecules catalyze the breakdown and toxification of superoxide anion, some of which have proven to possess clinically useful properties acting to promote healing and reduce inflammation. However, all such molecules have substantial deficiencies which sharply limit their clinical efficacy. One approach has been to use certain low molecular weight copper chelates, such as salicylate copper or diisopropylsalicylate copper, which possess superoxide dismutase activity. While these complexes also possess anti inflamatory and healing actions, they tend to dissociate after injection, since the binding affinity of the organic component to copper is too low to retain the copper under physiological conditions. In addition, these small copper complexes tend to be poorly soluble under aqueous conditions, and must be administered with tissue irritating solubilizing agents. Another of these copper chelates, the penicillamine copper complex, often produces skin rashes and a personality change known as penicillamine psychosis. Another compound exhibiting superoxide dismutase activity, with a molecular weight of approximately 33,000, is the copper and zinc chelate known as Orgotein. Orgotein possesses anti inflammatory and anti trauma properties, and is thought to accelerate the healing of hemorrhoids, frost bite, skin abrasions, soft tissue injuries, and tissue damage associated with auto immune diseases such as arthritis and Krohn s disease. Orgotein has been isolated from bovine tissue, as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,758,682 and 3,832,338, and esterified Orgotein has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,022,888. However, Orgoteins evoke an antigenic response in humans, and when therapeutically applied, exert their action in the extra cellular tissue compartment, as opposed to penetrating into the cells themselves. Consequently, there exists a need in the art for an effective, non toxic method of enhancing the wound healing process and reducing inflammation, which further does not evoke an antigenic response. Briefly stated, the present invention discloses the use of a compound containing glycyl l histidyl l lysine copper II for the manufacture of a medicament for healing wounds. The medicament may be applied through intravenous injection, topical application, or injection into the wound or the area surrounding the wound. Alternatively, the composition may further include an effective amount of dimethylsulfoxide. In addition, the invention discloses use of a compound containing glycyl l histidyl l lysine copper II for the manufacture of a medicament for healing wounds, wherein the medicament reduces the traumatic effects in animals occurring subsequent to major tissue damage. Other aspects of the invention will become evident upon reference to the following detailed description. As noted above, in the majority of wound healing formulations, immunological considerations suggest that components used in the formulations will elicit antibody recognition and a subsequent inflammatory response in animals other than the donor species. Further, other alternatives, generally known as superoxide dismutases, tend to be either poorly soluble under aqueous conditions or evoke an antigenic response in the recipient. Wound healing is a highly specific biological response involving many closely coordinated events which must be kept in balance for proper healing. Immunological cells must clear bacteria and damaged tissue from the wound, and then allow other processes to occur, such as the re epithelialization of the lost skin, deposition of fibroblastic cells of the structural protein collagen to provide temporary wound strength, the regrowth of nervous, blood vessel, and lymphatic networks, the contraction of the wound area, and the reestablishment of hair follicles in the newly formed skin. If any process improperly predominates, healing is partial and inadequate. For example, excessive collagen deposition results in permanent scarring, while excessive blood vessel growth may give rise to hemangioma. It has also been observed that cosmetic surgery often gives inadequate results due to the poor establishment of skin grafts or skin flaps used to cover surgical wounds. Due to the complex interaction of various processes in the proper healing of wounds, a superior method for enhancing the wound healing process should include the proper maintenance of each of these processes without evoking an antigenic response. The present invention exemplifies such a method, and further provides other related advantages. For purposes of the present invention, the term wound is defined to include any type or 1 surgical or accidental incision or removal of tissue 2 acute or chronic lesion such as a bed sore 3 tissue damage created by burns or ionizing radiation or 4 movements or transplantations of tissue to different locations such as skin grafts . All such wounds are characterized by an initial inflammatory phase followed by the local regeneration of new tissue to restore a normal or healthy condition. The present invention utilizes a therapeutically effective amount of a compound consisting essentially of glycyl l histidyl l lysine copper II hereinafter referred to as GHL Cu for the manufacture of a medicament for healing wounds in animals. It will be evident to one skilled in the art that the ratio of GHL to Cu may be altered slightly, while still retaining significant wound healing activity. For example, a ratio of 2 1 GHL to Cu may be particularly well suited to certain wound healing applications. The GHL Cu utilized in this invention may be prepared from commercially available GHL BACHEM, Torrence, Ca. . Commercially available GHL is about 95 pure, but often includes small amounts of mildly neurotoxic materials, and as such should be further purified. GHL Cu possesses significant superoxide dismutase activity at physiological pH, and like other superoxide dismutases, has anti inflammatory and wound healing properties. GHL Cu also inhibits platelet aggregation and the production of the vasoconstructive and thrombosis inducing hormone, thromboxane. GHL Cu has been described as being strongly angiogenic in the rabbit cornea test Katori S. et al, J Natl. Cancer Inst., 1982, 69 5 , 1183 1188 Further, GHL Cu has advantages over low molecular weight molecules with superoxide dismutase activity due to its high affinity pK 16.4 for Cu II . This affinity is equivalent to the copper II transport site on the blood protein albumin pK 16.2 Lau and Sarkar, In addition, GHL Cu is soluble in quantities constituting over 25 of total solution weight, the solubility being variable through the addition of fatty groups to the molecule. Similar to other superoxide dismutases, GHL Cu reduces traumatic effects occurring subsequent to major tissue damage. For purposes of the present invention, the term trauma is defined to include effects occurring secondary to tissue injury, such as hyperfibrinogenemia, thromboembolism, shock, and loss of ambulatory desires. To summarize the examples which follow, The following examples are offered by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation. GHL was purified by dissolving in glass distilled water 50 mg ml , then centrifuging at 20,000 g for 1 hour at 3 degrees centigrade. This removes poorly water soluble material remaining from the synthetic procedure. The supernatant is lyophilized, then passed through a Sephadex G 10 column at 3 degrees centigrade in a solvent of 0.5 acetic acid. The main peak that elutes behind the solvent front monitored by absorption at 254 nanometers is lyophized to dryness. GHL Cu was prepared by combination of purified GHL with equimolar amounts of cupric acetate and sodium hydroxide, then precipitated by use of ethanol addition and low temperature by published methods Perkins et al., In mice, incision wounds on the flanks six 1.5 cm wounds per animal were swabbed daily with either a solution containing GHL Cu 100 micrograms per ml in phosphate buffered saline PBS at a physiological pH, or PBS alone 12 animals each group . After five days, the wounds were scored 1.0 for complete closure, 0.5 for partial closure, and 0.0 for non closure Table 1 . In pigs, skin and subcutaneous fat were excised 2.5 cm squares, three squares per side from the upper back of Yorkshire pigs 10 12 kg . On one side of the animal, GHL Cu 50 micrograms in PBS was injected into the underlying tissue while contralateral wounds were injected with PBS only. The wound area was covered with either collagen pads, dehydrated pig skin, or live pig skin autologous skin graft . Wounds then were blanketed with Petrolatum gauze Cheesborough Ponds, Greenwich, Ct. , then dry gauze. Adhesive tape and Vetrap 3M, St. Paul, Mn. held the bandages in place. All animals received 100,000 units penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin per kilogram body weight. GHL Cu treated wounds healed faster than contralateral controls in all 10 pigs studied. By five days, treated wounds were measurably smaller than controls. This effect increased for three weeks post wounding. At day 21, one treatment of GHL Cu reduced the remaining wound size 64.9 22.1 in 14 wounds on eight pigs observed for this period p .0023 for pooled data . This wound reduction occurred regardless of the type of wound coverage Dehydrated pigskin 4 wounds 77.3 16.3 , autologous skin grafts 2 wounds 82.0 1.4 , gelatin film pads 6 wounds 58.8 16.4 , no coverage on wound 2 wounds 41.5 3.5 . In rats, experiments started with the excision of a circular patch of skin from the back. The outer circumference of the wound was injected with either 50 micrograms GHL Cu in PBS 10 rats or PBS only for controls 6 rats immediately after wounding, a second time at 24 hours, and a third time at 48 hours. Wounds were photographed at 5, 10, 15, and 25 days post wounding. Data was analyzed by measurement of the wound circumference by computerized digitization of the perimeter of the wound in the photograph, then corrected with a scale bar to compensate for variations in magnification among the photographs. Timepoint and group information were coded at the time of digitization to eliminate subjective bias Table 2 . In an additional blinded study of these effects, the photographs of wounds at 25 days were judged by four surgeons as fully healed or not fully healed, then the judgment statistically analyzed by the Fisher Exact Test Table 3 . Inflammatory paw edema was induced in rats by local injection of 1.5 mg carrageenan followed by intravenous injection of 0.5 mg GHL Cu 30 minutes later. At 3 hours post carrageenan, paw diameter was measured. Control rats received saline injections into the paws. There were 10 rats in each group Table 4 . GHL Cu reduces trauma induced by tissue damage. In rats, tissue damage was induced by the injection of 0.25 ml sterile turpentine into the muscle mass of each rear leg. This procedure induces tissue damage, widespread intravascular coagulation, an acute phase production of stress associated proteins, and generalized shock effects. These trauma effects were greatly minimized by the intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg GHL Cu at times of 1 hour, 24 hours and 48 hours after the turpentine injection. After the tissue damage the rats move very little, huddle together, and do not groom themselves as evidenced by very rough coats for 2 to 3 days. In contrast, in the rats treated with GHL Cu, nearly normal activity and grooming patterns return by 24 hours after the turpentine injection Table 5 . In addition, in the GHL Cu treated animals the post injury rise in the blood protein fibrinogen is reduced Table 6 . The acute phase increase in blood fibrinogen after injury often complicates the recovery by increasing blood viscosity, and inducing red blood cell sludging and thromboembolitic episodes. The application of GHL Cu markedly accelerates the healing of burn wounds in mice. Burns were induced in Swiss Webster mice by applying a 1.5 cm diameter brass cylinder at 100 C for 5 seconds to the shaved backs of the anesthetized animals. After the burning, and at 24 and 48 hours later, the burn area was infiltrated with 3 ug of GHL Cu with a molar ratio of 2 molecules GHL for each copper atom in 0.05 ml sterile water for injection Abbott Laboratories, water contains 0.9 benzyl alcohol as a preservative . Control animals were injected with only the sterile water. At 10 days post burn, the original skin necrosed and in only 1 of 8 animals was there partial recovery of the burned skin. In contrast, in the GHL Cu treated group the original skin recovered from the burn trauma with normal appearance and hair growth in 13 of 15 animals. GHL Cu improves the healing of wounds covered with skin grafts, and in the establishment of the skin graft. In Yorkshire pigs, skin and underlying fat was removed from a 1.5 cm square to create a wound. A split thickness skin graft was prepared from another portion of the animal and sewn over the wound area. GHL Cu was formulated into liposome vesicles by standard procedures using ratio of 0.625. The GHL Cu containing liposomes 0.1 ml liposomes containing 50 ug GHL Cu was infiltrated into the tissue under the graft while control grafts received liposomes without GHL Cu. At 15 days post grafting, the skin grafts of the group treated with GHL Cu containing liposomes had smoothly covered the wound area and blended smoothly into the adjacent skin. In contrast, without GHL Cu, only the center of the attached skin graft was established and the edges of the wound margin were still covered with scar tissue. The average area of newly established skin was 1.2 0.3 sq cm in the control animals against 4.3 0.7 in the GHL Cu treated animals p value of difference 0.001 . From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.
