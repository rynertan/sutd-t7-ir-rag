# EMISSION CONTROLLED TWO CYCLE ENGINE

## Abstract
An emission controlled two cycle internal combustion engine is disclosed. The presence of unburned hydrocarbons and oil smoke is substantially reduced by eliminating the use of lubricating oil in the fuel, confining lubricating oil for the engine to the crankcase, purging exhaust gases from the combustion chamber with pressurized fresh air, and timing the injection of fuel into the combustion chamber to occur near the closure of the exhaust port to eliminate the escape of unburned fuel through the exhaust port.
