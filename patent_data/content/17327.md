# Power module casing.

## Abstract
A power module 10 of the electrochemical battery type wherein shunt losses along the side edges of the anodes 18 disposed generally parallel to the electrolyte path are prevented by the anode side edges being sealed relative to the casing 12 by the casing being constructed with internal side walls 62 which are deformable under gaseous press ure to maintain sealing contact with the cell units 14 .
