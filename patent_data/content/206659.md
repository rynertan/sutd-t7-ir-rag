# Semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser having high efficiency of lumi nescence can be obtained by forming spatial fluctuations in potential so that the potential differs from position to position inside a plane perpendicular to the direction of current flow and electrons and holes or excitons formed by either can be localized not only in the direction of current flow but also inside the plane perpendicular to the current flowing direction. To achieve this, corrugations 42, 43 or ruggedness having a mean pitch of less than 100 nm and a level difference of from 1 10 to 1 2 of the mean thickness of an active layer 32 are formed on the surface of the active layer 32 of the semi conductor laser.
