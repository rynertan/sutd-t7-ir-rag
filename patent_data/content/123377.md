## Description
POLYCONDENSAT I ON PROCESS Background of the Invention The field of this invention relates to a polycondensation process for the manufacture of organic polymers from prepolymers or salts using a high temperature system wherein the polymerization is conducted in a steam or vapor stream at melt temperatures in the range of about 3500F to about 7500F while the wall temperature of the aerosol jet tube reactor is about 4000F to about 10000F and the total residence time is kept in the range of about 0.1 seconds to about 20 seconds. Our process is suitable for the manufacture of polyesters, polycarbonates, polyarylates, polyesterarylates, polyamides, polyamide imides and polyimides.Our novel aerojet regime process is applicable to any polycondensation reactor provided the salt or prepolymer is homogeneous and is in a single phase, the salt or prepolymer is stable under the high reaction temperatures and is capable of forming droplets. This means that the salt or prepolymers useful in our novel process atomize easily at the inlet of the jet reactor and thus have a high surface to volume ratio in the reactor. Our novel aerosol jet process for the manufacture of polyamides, polyamide imides, polyimides, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyarylates and polyesterarylates is unknown to the prior art, however, we will discuss the most relevant prior art references relating to polyamides. U.S. Patent 2,361,717 discloses a slug flow tubular reactor, reaction pressures were about 1000 psig in the preheat sections and residence times were 15 to 30 minutes. This is clearly a much slower process than our novel aerosol jet process where the residence times are about 0.1 to about 20 seconds. Another reference of interest may be Canadian Patent 527,473 which discloses the use of variable tube diameters to control pressure drop and temperatures. U.S. Patent 3,960,820 discloses a slug flow regime using steam injection to control residence time by pressure control. Other references of interest include U.S. Patent 2,689,839 and U.S. Patent 3,357,955 which relate to additive additions or product quality adjustment of polyamides and U.S. Patent 3,300,449 which discloses a residence time of about 10 to about 120 minutes. U.S.Patents 3,193,535 and 3,258,313 disclose a process with a tubular reactor which uses a high water content 47 by weight. In reviewing all these references it is clear that our novel aerosol jet polycondensation process has not been contemplated by the prior art. The general object of this invention is to provide a novel polycondensation process wherein the polycondensation is carried out in an aerosol jet regime at melt temperatures of about 5000F to about 7500F and contact times of about 0.1 seconds to about 20 seconds. A more particular object is to provide a novel condensation process for condensing aromatic carboxylic acids and anhydrides with diamines which are difficult to conduct under methods known to the prior art. Further, objects will be apparent from the description of the invention hereunder. In our novel process we prepare a salt by reacting an aliphatic or aromatic diamine with di, tri or tetracarboxylic acids or their corresponding anhydrides or mixtures of the various acids or anhydrides. For polyesters, polycarbonates, polyarylates and polyesterarylates we prepare the appropriate prepolymers. Suitably, in our process for the manufacture of polyamides, polyamide imides or polyimides, a salt is first produced. This is carried out in any suitably designed stirred reactor. Feed materials are charged into the reactor at a temperature of about 750F to about 175of. Solvent content of the salt solution is maintained at less than 25 by weight, preferably about 13 to about 17 by weight. Temperatures are then raised to provide a homogenous salt solution. This is usually the range of about 3750F to about 4500F. As quickly as possible, pressures are allowed to build to the limits of the equipment, usually to about 300 to about 600 psig.The salt prepared as described above, is metered through a pump and pressure is increased to about 1500 to about 3000 psig. If additional processing is required to purify or filter the salt solution, the operation is carried out prior to the pump. The resulting salt and prepolymer mix is then heated and flashed through a control valve or nozzle to give an aerosol mist at pressures of about 0 to about 400 psig. The salt and prepolymer mix then is passed through the flash reactor. This reactor is designed to provide a high heat flux to the polymer and has a wall temperature of about 6000F to about 10000F. The melt temperature range is about 5000F to about 7500F through the flash reactor.The total residence time of the reactants in the flash reactor is about 0.1 to about 20 seconds, preferably about 0.2 to about 10 seconds and varies with the feed rate and pressure which are suitably in the range of about 100 lb hour inch2 to about 200 lb hour inch2. In our process specific mass flow refers to mass flow per unit of reactor cross sectional area. The lower limit is defined by the limits of proper flow velocity through the reactor for the aerosol jet regime as opposed to slug flow. The upper limit is defined by the limits of heat input. When utilizing our process to prepare polyesters from dicarboxylic acids and glycol, polycarbonates from diphenols and phosgene, polyarylates from diphenols and dicarboxylic acids and polyesterarylates from diphenols, dicarboxylic acids and phosgenes we prepare a prepolymer which can suitably be an oligomer, dimer or trimer but must be homogeneous and is in a single phase, is stable under the high reaction temperatures and is capable of atomizing readily at the inlet of the jet reactor. The temperatures and other reaction conditions are the same as set forth hereinabove.Suitable polyesters which are prepared by our process and disclosed by Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley and Sons 1982 , pages 531 576, including the references cited therein. All the pages and the references cited therein from the article inKirk Othmer are incorporated into this application and made part hereof. Suitable polycarbonates which are prepared by our process are disclosed in the aforementionedKirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 18, pages 479 through 494 including the references cited therein and in Chapter 2 of the book, New Linear Polymers by Lee et al, McGraw liill Book Co. 1967 including the references cited therein.All the pages from both citations are incorporated into this application and made part hereof including the references cited in the KirkOthmer article and in Chapter 2 of the Lee et al book.Suitable polyarylates prepared by our process are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,772,389 and 4,302,382 and the references cited therein. Both patents and the references cited therein are incorporated by references into this application and made part hereof. Suitably, from the flash reactor the polymer is injected directly on to the screws of a twin screw extruder. Residence time in the twin screw extruder is about 45 seconds to about 3 minutes. Other types of finishing reactors are also suitably employed such as disc ring reactors, agitated stranding devolatizers and thin film evaporators. The advantages of our novel aerosol jet reactor process are that the flow regime in the flash reactor is an aerosol jet and that the residence time after salt preparation is about 76 to about 240 seconds while in the prior art process the residence time is in the range of about 75 to 240 minutes. The maximum melt temperature in our novel process is about 6200F to about 73off while in the prior art processes the range is below 5700F, usually around 390DF to 4500F. Furthermore, in our process the flow is self controlling while the prior art processes require special controls. A further advantage of our novel aerosol jet process is that we are able to process high melt viscosity polymers while conventional processes are not able to process high melt viscosity polymers with any confidence. Suitable di, tri and tetracarboxylic acids useful in our process to manufacture polyamides include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, 5 tertiary butylisophthalic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, bussylic acid and etc. The preferred acids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and adipic acid and mixtures of these.

It should be understood that tricarboxylic acids and their corresponding anhydrides like trimellitic anhydride are useful for the manufacture of polyamide imides and tetracarboxylic acids and their corresponding anhydrides are useful for the manufacture of polyimides. Aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic diamines useful in our process include the following hexamethylene diamines, trimethylhexamethylene diamine, ethylene di amine, tetramethylene di amine, octamethylene diamine, nonamethylene di amine, decamethylene di amine, dodecamethylene di amine, 4,4 diamino dicyclohexylmethane , xylene diamine.

The preferred aromatic diamine is meta phenylene diamine. The preferred process comprises preparing a salt of an aliphatic or aromatic di amine or a mixture of these and di, tri or tetracarboxylic acid, a mixture of these or their corresponding anhydrides by reacting both feedstocks at a temperature of about 3750F to about 4500F in an aqueous medium provided the water content of the resulting solution is kept below 25 water by weight.The resulting salt solution is subjected to a pressure of about 1500 to about 3000 psig and is then passed through a preheat zone where the temperature is increased from about 425 oF to about 6250F, the total residence time is kept about 25 to about 50 seconds, the reactants then are flashed through a control valve or nozzle to give an aerosol mist at a pressure of about OOF to about 4000F and melt temperatures of about 5000F to about 75O0F. The total residence time in the reactor being about 0.1 to about 20 seconds. The polymer is then injected onto the screws of a twin screw reactor. The residence time in the extruder being about 45 seconds to about 3 minutes. The preferred polymers manufactured by our process are the polyamides prepared from hexamethylene di amine and terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and adipic acid in the mole ratio of about 100 65 25 10 to about 100 85 5 10 and the polyamides which are prepared from hexamethylene diamine, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid in the mole ratio of about 100 30 70 to about 100 90 10. These polyamides, polyamide imides and polyimides prepared by the novel process described herein are used as replacements for metals in engineering applications, and therefore, they are molded and usually filled with reinforcing materials. For other applications fibers and laminates are also prepared from the polymers manufactured using our novel process. Injection molding of the novel polymers produced by the novel process is accomplished by injecting the polymer into a mold maintained at a temperature of about 2500F to about 5000F. In this process a 0.1 2.0 minute cycle is used with a barrel temperature of about 5000F to about 70O0F. The injection molding conditions are given in Table 1.

The preferred range is about 30 to about 40 . Suitably reinforcing materials are glass fibers, glass beads, glass spheres and glass fabrics.The glass fibers are made of alkali free boron silicate glass or alkali containing C glass. The thickness of the glass fiber is suitably on the average between 3mm and 30mum. The length of the glass fiber is not critical and both long and short glass fibers are suitable. Long fibers have an average length of from 5mm to 55mm and short fibers have an average filament length from about 0.05mm to about 5mm. Any standard commercial grade fibers, especially glass fiber, may be used to reinforce our polymers. Glass beads ranging from about 5mm to about 50mm in diameter may also be used as a reinforcing material. The reinforced polymers may be prepared in various ways. For example, so called roving endless glass fiber strands are coated with the polymer and subsequently granulated. The cut fibers or the glass beads may also be mixed with the soluble polymer and heated to form the reinforced polymer. Injection molding of the reinforced polymers is carried out in the same manner as shown inTable 1. The following examples illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that the examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be wholly definitive with respect to conditions or scope of the invention. GENERAL PROCEDURE The salt is prepared as follows diacid and diamine monomers are charged to a batch reactor with a pitched blade turbine and of suitable temperature and pressure ratings to provide a homogeneous salt solution. This is typically 4250F to 4500F and 450 to 550 psig. Additional components including water, catalyst, silicone oil end capping reagent, and plasticizer are also introduced in the salt reactor. Water content of the salt can range to 25 by weight. The preferred range is about 13 to 17 by weight. The salt is metered through a pump and pressure is increased to 1500 5000 psig. The resulting prepolymer then passes through a preheat zone where temperature is raised from about 4250F to about 4500F to about 55O0F to about 6250F. The total residence time here is 25 to 50 seconds. The resulting prepolymer is then flashed through a control valve to give an aerosol mist at pressure of 0 400 psig and the polymer is then passed through a tubular flash reactor. This reactor is designed to provide a high heat flux to the polymer and has a wall temperature of about 6500F to about 1000 F, melt temperature range is about 5000F to about 7500F through the flash reactor.The total residence time in the reactor is about 0.1 to about 20 seconds based on feed rate and pressure and this is indicated for each example, Examples 1 through 20. The inherent viscosity I.V. is measured in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane at 300C. The polymer is injected directly on the screws of the twin screw reactor and the results are given in Examples 1 through 14 under appreciated molecular weight. Examples 1 through 14 were prepared as described inGeneral Procedure but specific details and results are noted for each Example hereinbelow EXAMPLE 1Monomers 10 hexamethylene diammonium adipate 65 hexamethylene diammonium terephthalate 25 hexamethylene diammonium isophthalateWater Content 15 by weight Procedure The di acids, diamines and water were charged to the salt reactor of room temperature. The initial charge totaled 36 lb 50 g moles . Additional charges were 7.2 lbs 10 g moles each and were fed through lock hoppers as the salt reactor was operated in a fed batch mode. The salt reactor was a 5 gallon stirred tank reactor with a pitched blade turbine, oil jacket, variable speed drive and internal coils. Once the salt reactor had been charged, it was purged with inert gas and heated to 4250F 2180C . The pressure was set to 480 psig by first allowing the water in the salt to reach its equilibrium pressure and then adjusting with inert gas. In the fed batch operations, the salt saw a range of residence times. They averaged about 100 minutes. Also as a result of the fed batch mode of operation, it was necessary to include a second surge vessel in the salt preparation section. This vessel, which was at 4250F 2180C and 450 psig, was used to isolate the salt reactor during charge addition. Upon leaving the salt section, the salt was passed through a 140 micron filter into a two headed positive displacement pump. Temperature through the pump were maintained at 4250F 2180C . Pressures were increased to 1800 psig in the pump. Following the pump, the salt solution was passed through a preheat zone and heated to 6000F 3160C . The pressure prevented vapor formation in the preheater. Residence time in the preheater was 40 seconds. The salt entered the flash reactor through a research control valve where pressure was reduced from 1800 psig to 400 psig. Wall temperature in the flash reactor were kept at 7500F 3990C using electrical heaters but the melt temperature ranged from 5250F 2740C to 6120F 3220C depending on location in the flash reactor. Pressure in the flash reactor was controlled by a second RCV. Residence time in the flash reactor was estimated at 7.6 seconds. The run had a 141 2 lb hr in specific mass feed rate per unit of cross sec tional area. After leaving the flash reactor, our prepolymer had an inherent viscosity Phenol TCE of 0.20 to 0.24 dl g. It was injected directly onto the screws of the extruder.An open screw design was used to facilitate vapor removal. A screw speed of 200 rpm was used to maintain minimum fill on the screws. Temperatures were 6200F 327 C in the injection zone but they were dropped gradually to 6000F 3160C at the die head. Following the extruder, the polymer strand was passed through a water bath and then pelletized. The mean product I.V. was 1.20 dl g with a standard deviation of 0.09 dl g over the 6 hour run. Total production was 64 lbs of polymer.
