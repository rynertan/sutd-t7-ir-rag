# Method of producing sheets of crystalline material.

## Abstract
A method of producing sheets of crystalline material, wherein a growth mask 12 is formed upon a substrate 10 and crystalline material is grown at areas of the substrate 10 exposed through the mask 12 and laterally over the surface of the mask 12 to form a sheet of crystalline material. This sheet 18 is thereafter separated from the substrate 10 . The mask 12 is formed so as to possess significantly better adhesion to the substrate 10 than to the crystalline material, e.g. by use of an adhesion promoting layer 36 on the substrate 10 . It is possible to strip the crystalline sheet leaving the mask substantially intact on the substrate.
