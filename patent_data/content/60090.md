## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ETHYLENE PROPYLENE COPOLYMERS The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethylene propylene copolymers, and more particularly to a process for the preparation of saturated elastomeric and vulcanizable copolymers of ethylene with propylene. U.S. Patent No. 4 013 823 describes the preparation of elastomeric ethylene propylene copolymers by copolymerization of the monomers in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a mixture of an Al alkyl with a titanium halide, the latter being supported on an anhydrous magnesium halide complexed with a Lewis base an electron donor . By such a process there are obtained copolymers with hourly yields varying from about 30,000 to 500,000 g g of titanium used as a catalyst. British Patent No. 1 492 864 describes the preparation of thermoplastic ethylene propylene copolymers having pronounced elastomeric characteristics in the non vulcanized state, by copolymerizing propylene with 10 50 by weight of ethylene, in the presence of a catalyst formed by a mixture of an Al alkyl, complexed with a specific amount of a Lewis base, with a titanium halide, likewise complexed with a Lewis base and supported by an activated anhydrous magnesium halide. By means of such a catalyst there may be obtained copolymers having a high crystallinity of the polypropylenic and or ethylenic type, with hourly yields varying from 8,000 to 80,000 g of copolymer per gram of metal titanium. Moreover, Belbian Patent No. 848 527 describes catalysts suitable for the homo and copolymerization of Oc olefines either with each other or with ethylene, and consisting of a mixture of i an Al alkyl complexed with a Lewis base and ii the reaction product titanization of a magnesium halide complexed with a Lewis base with a tetravalent titanium halide. The copolymers thus obtained, at least for propylene contents of from 40 to 60 by weight, have a crystallinity of both the polyethylenic as well as the polypropylenic type the hourly yields at which such copolymers are generally obtained are about 100,000 g g of titanium halide. It has now been found by the applicants that there may be obtained ethylene propylene copolymers free of crystallinity of the polypropylenic type and with a crystallinity of the polyethylenic type lower than 10 , with exceptionally high yields, of the order of 1 2 million grams of polymer per gram of titanium per hour, by a process which comprises polymerizing an ethylene propylene mixture with a catalyst obtained by the reaction of a a metalorganic aluminium compound selected from one or more Al trialkyls and Al alkyl monohalides, and b a titanium halide, in particular a titanium tetra halide, supported on an anhydrous magnesium dichloride or magnesium dibromide in activated form, wherein the X ray spectrum of the magnesium dichloride or magnesium dibromide is characterized in that the line of maximum intensity appearing in the spectrum of the normal type magnesium dihalide, as defined by AS CM 3 0854 and AS2M 15 836, is not present and that in its place there is a halo with its maximum intensity displaced with respect to that line. In the case of MgOl2, the maximum intensity of the halo is displaced by a distance d comprised from d 2.44 to d 2.97 . In the case of MgBr2, the maximum intensity of the halo is displaced by a distance d comprised from d 2.80 to d 3.24 . In general the composition of the component b may be expressed as 70 90 by weight of Mg dichloride or Mg dibromide, the balance being represented by the Ti compound. The component b may be prepared according to a variety of methods. One of these comprises bringing the Ti compound into contact with the pre activated Mg halide having the X ray spectrum characteristics previously specified. A further method of preparing the component b which is also the preferred method, comprises grinding a mixture of Mg halide with the Ti compound, operating under conditions grinding time, type of mill at which in theX ray spectrum of the ground product there appears the change or modification of the above indicated spectrum. Still another method of preparing the component b comprises reacting an adduct between the Mg halide and an alcohol, and then treating the reaction product with an excess of TiCl4, at a temperature from 60 C to the boiling temperature of TiCl4. The Al alkyl compound is used in such a case in a ratio to the adduct at least sufficient to react with the alcohol present. The metalorganic compounds of Al, usable as component a , preferably consist of Al trialkyl compounds such as Al triethyl, Al tripropyl and Al triisobutyl compounds or compounds of the formulaEMI4.1 Al C12H25 3. The copolymerisation of the ethylene with propylene utilizing the previously defined catalyst may be conducted in a liquid phase, in the presence of for example hexane, heptane or cyclohexane, or in a gaseous phase in the presence of a mixture of the components a and b of the catalyst. In the mixture of the components a and b of the catalyst the relationship or ratio between the components is not critical preferably, however, the components a and b are employed in weight ratios of from 200 1 to 3000 1. The polymerization temperature is generally maintained at OOC to 15000, preferably at 0 to 5000. The operational pressure may be atmospheric pressure or a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. The ethylene and the propylene are preferably polymerized with each other in such ratios as to obtain copolymer containing from 40 to 60 by weight of copolymerized ethylene. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples.EXAMPLES 1 8 Into a 20 litre autoclave, maintained at the reaction temperature indicated in the following table, there were continuously introduced, in the given order, propylene and a mixture of Al triisobutyl with Al n.butyl as component a of the catalyst in an amount of 0.5 g lt of total fresh monomers fed into the reactor. The pressure was thereupon brought up to 12.5 atm.with ethylene, and component b of the catalyst, dispersed in a paraffinic hydrocarbon, was then added and the feeding of the monomers and catalytic components a and b was carried out at the previously indicated temperature. In some instances Zn C2H5 2was added to the monomers fed in as a molecular weight regulator. The catalytic component b was prepared by grinding 60 g of anhydrous MgOl2 together with 4 g of tirol4 for 90 hours in a vibrating mill of the VIBRATOS type produced byM. V. Gravenhage of Holland, having a total volume of one litre, and containing 3 kg of stainless steel balls of 16 mm diameter The grinding was carried out assuming a filling coefficient equal to 135 g lt of total empty volume, at a temperature inside the grinder of about 40 C, with grinding times differing from test to test of 25 to 150 hours. The loading of the mill with the products to be ground, the subsequent grinding, and the discharge from the mill of the co ground product were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.
