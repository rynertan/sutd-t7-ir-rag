# Method and apparatus for conducting remote surveys of the earth s crust.

## Abstract
The present invention concerns a method for remotely surveying the earth s surface. The method comprises the steps of advancing a plurality of electromagnetic scanning devices 3 along a known path at a predetermined height and velocity above the earth s surface, simultaneously scanning a track 4 of predetermined width on the earth s surface with said scanning devices, detecting with the scanning devices electromagnetic radiation received from the earth s crust in the electromagnetic spectrum, each scanning device responding to a different spectral range within the elec tromagnetic spectrum, and producing a film record 20 from each scanning device corresponding to the intensity of the radiant energy detected by the scanning device within its spectral range. To enable analysis of the film records so pro duced it is essential that they are in register so that each film record is scanned by a flying spot scanner 21 , the individual rasters of the flying spot scanners being controlled by con trols 24 to achieve registration of the images of the film records 20 .
