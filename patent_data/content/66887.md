# Protective sealing composition in molded form for application to the skin.

## Abstract
Protective sealing compositions in the form of molded rings or sheets, which comprise gelled mixtures of water absorbing particulate hydrocolloid gum and non toxic liquid polyhydroxy alcohol are provided with increased resistance to the drained fluid viz. urine or intestinal fluids by incorporating a small amount of colloidal silica. Fumed silica is preferred. By limiting the amount of silica added appreciable reductions in the wet tack and or dry tack of the composition can be avoided. The compositions can be used with ostomy devices, wound drainage devices, and incontinence devices.
