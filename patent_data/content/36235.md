# Method and plant for the evaporation of a liquid solution thereby using mechanical compression.

## Abstract
A liquid solution is passed through a multi stage evap oration plant, while using recirculated vapour fed through a mechanical compressor 42 for increasing its pressure and temperature. The plant comprises a number of evaporators 37, 38, 39 connected in series and being split up into a plurality of groups C,B and A with a decreasing number of evaporators as seen in the flow direction , the vapour being fed in parallel streams through said groups.
