In a delivery slip system, an upper paper slip 17 bears appropriate printing 15 including blank spaces and a pressure sensitive layer in a predetermined area on the back thereof a see through write upon waterproof covering strip 18 of a film having a width larger than the delivery slip is adhered on top of said slip one or more copy slips 13 having the same width as the delivery slip are disposed below said delivery slip the covering film strip has an adhesive layer in the upper and lower edge portions on the back thereof and a release paper strip 14 beneath the lowest copy slip adheres to said waterproof covering film strip in the upper and lower edge portions thereof. The cover film 18 may have an opacity of 20 to 50 , e.g. obtained by extruding a sheet of a thermoplastic resin and filler and stretching the sheet. The copy slips 13 are self copying so that writing pressure on the cover film 18 within the blank spaces is copied onto the slips which can be separated at their end at perforations 46 , and after peeling off the release paper 14 the slip 12 and protective film 18 are adhered to an article e.g. a package by the adhesive on the rear of portions of the film. A method of making the delivery slip system is de scribed.
