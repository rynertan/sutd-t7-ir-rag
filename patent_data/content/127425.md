# Auxiliary wheel arrangement of a bicycle.

## Abstract
An auxiliary wheel arrangement of a bicycle comprises arms 2 extending sideways from the bicycle body to be vertically displaceable and means 6 or 9 or 12 or 16 to impart to the arms the torque required for lowering the tips of these arms and auxiliary wheels 9 attached to the tips of the arms. These arms are attached e.g. to the rear wheel of the bicycle on both sides thereof. A bicycle equipped with the auxiliary wheel arrangement, which can have its body banked in either lateral direction, is prevented from tilting when it is parked or stopped, being thus kept upright then without fail.
