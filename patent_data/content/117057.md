# ABRASION RESISTANT SLEEVE

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is an abrasion resistant sleeve for flat substrates, for example ribbon cable and the like, which includes a hollow flexible sleeve made from a fabric of engineering plastic that has been flattened to define two edges, each of which has a top and a bottom layer. The layers of each edge are bonded together permanently while the sleeve is in the flattened condition to maintain the sleeve in said condition. Preferably the sleeve is axially compressi ble and radially expansible. Also disclosed herein is a method for making such a sleeve.
