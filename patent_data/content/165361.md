## Description
CbYCAR3 ONATE S EXHIBITING IMPROVED REAT RESISTANCE RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation in part application of copending application Serial No.453,105, filed December 17, 1982. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polycarbonates are well known thermoplastic materials which due to their many advantageous properties find use as thermoplastic engineering materials in many commercial and industrial.applications. The polycarbonates exhibit, for example, excellent properties of toughness, flexibility, impact resistance, and heat resistance.The polycarbonates are generally prepared by the co reaction of a dihydric phenol such as bisphenol A with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. While presently available conventional polycarbonates are quiteKuseful in a wide range of applications there nevertheless exists a need, especially in applications involving high temperature environments, for.polycarbonates exhibiting greater heat resistance than that possessed by conventional polycarbonates. It is, therefore, an object of the instant invention to provide polycarbonates which exhibit improved heat resistance SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the instant invention there are provided linear polycarbonate resins which exhibit improved heat resistance. These polycarbonates are comprised of at least one repeating structural unit represented by the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R is independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl radicals R1is independently selected from halogen radicals X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms and n and n are independently selected from whole numbers having a value of from 0 to 2 inclusive, with the proviso that the sum of n plus n is at least one. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that linear carbonate polymers can be obtained which exhibit improved heat resistance as compared to conventional polycarbonates. These polycarbonates are derived from i a carbonate precursor and ii at least one dihydric phenol represented by the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl radicals RÚ is independently selected from halogen radicals n and n are independently selected from whole numbers having a value of from 0 to 2 inclusive, with the proviso that the sum of n plus n is at least one and X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. The preferred alkyl radicals represented by R are the lower alkyl radicals, preferably those containing from I to about 4 carbon atoms, e.g, t methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, and the like. The preferred halogen radicals represented by R1 are selected from chlorine, bromine, and fluorine, with bromine and chlorine being the more preferred halogen radicals. Preferably X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. More prefreably X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, Most preferably X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Particularly useful dihydric phenols ofFormula I are those wherein X is a cycloalkylidene radical containing from 12 to about 14 ring carbon atoms. Preferred dihydric phenols of Formula I are those represented by the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein X, R, R1, n and n are as defined herein afore. Preferably X in Formula Ta represents a monocyclic cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, more preferably from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and most preferably from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Preferred compounds of Formula Ia are those wherein R1 and R, when R is an alkyl radical, are in the ortho positions relative to the hydroxyl radicals. The more preferred compounds of Formula Ia are those wherein R is hydrogen n and n are both at least one, and the halogen substituents represented by R1 are in the ortho positions relative to the hydroxyl radicals. sIn these dihydric phenols X is preferably a cycloalkylidene radical containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, more preferably from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and most preferably from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. Particularly useful dinydric phenols ofFormula Ia are those represented by the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein X and RÚ are as defined hereinaforePreferably X in Formula Ib contains from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, more preferably from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and most preferably from 12 to about. 16 ring carbon atoms. The term monocyclic as used herein with respect to the cycloalkylidene radicals represented by X is meant to specify that the cycloalkylidene radicals contain only one ring, i.e., they are non polycvclic. Thus these non polycyc1iccycloa1kyl idene radicals do not include those cycli groups which are.non monocyclic e.g., bicyclic, bridged, or fused cyclic structures such as 2 norbornylidene bicyclo 3.3.0 octylene, and decahydronaphtbylene. Some illustrative non limting examples of dihydric phenols of Formula Ia, wherein R and R1 are in the ortho positions relative to the hydroxyl radicals, include EMI6.1 EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 The dihydric phenols of Formula I may be prepared by reacting a particular ketone with a phenol to form a dihdyric phenol, and thereafter halogenating this dihydric phenol. The ketone is reacted with the phenol in the presence of an acid catalyst and preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst and a cocatalyst such as butyl mercaptan. The particular ketone reactant is selected from ketones represented by the general formulaEMI11.1 wherein X is as defined hereinafore. More particularly, the ketone of Formula II may be represented by the general formulaEMI11.2 wherein Y is selected from alkylene radicals containing from 7 to about 15 carbon atoms which together with theEMI11.3 radical form a cyclic structure containing from 8 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. The phenol reactants are selected from phenols represented by the general formulae EMI12.1 wherein R, n and n are as defined hereinafore. In order to obtain the novel dihydric phenols of Formula I one mole of the ketone of Formula II is reacted with two moles of the phenol reactants in the presence of an acid catalyst, and preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst and a cocatalyst such as butyl mercaptan. Generally, the phenol reactants are present in excess. Some illustrative non limiting examples of suitable acid catalysts that may be employed include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, poly styrene sulfonic acid , sulfuric acid, benzene sulfonic acid, and the like. rne phenols are reacted with the ketone under conditions of temperature and pressure, and in the presence of the acid catalyst, such that coreaction between the phenols and said ketone will occur to form the dihydric phenol.Generally, the reaction proceeds statisfactorily at about one atmosphere of pressure and at temperatures of from room temperature 25 C to about 100 C. The amount of the acid catalyst employed is a catalytic amount. By catalytic amount is meant an amount effective to catalyze the reaction between the ketone and the phenols to produce the dihydric phenol. Generally, this amount is in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 percent. However, in actual practice it is usually higher since the water coproduct formed in the reaction dilutes the acid catalyst and renders it somewhat less effective slowing the reaction than in its undiluted state. The dihydric phenol intermediate formed by the coreaction of the ketone and the phenols is then halogenated in accordance with well known conventional halogenation procedures to form the dihydric phenol of Formula I. Another method by which.some of the dihydric phenols of Formula I may be prepared involves reacting a ketone of Formula I with dihydric phenols represented by the general formulaEMI13.1 EMI14.1 wherein n, n , Rand R1 are as defined hereinafore, in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid catalyst. In this method the dihydric phenol ofFormula I is formed directly with no need to halogenate an intermediate dihydric phenol. In the preparation o the carbonate polymers of the instant invention only one dihydric phenol of Formula I may be employed, or a mixture of two or more different dihydric phenols of Formula I may be employed. The carbonate precursor that is reacted with the dihydric phenol of Formula I may be a carbonyl halide, a dia ryl carbonate, or a bishaloformate.The preferred carbonate precursors are the carbonyl halides The carbonyl halides are selected from carbonyl chlroide, carbonyl bromide, and mixtures thereof The preferred carbony l hali de is carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. The novei linear carbonate polymers of the instant invention contain at least one recurring structural unit represented by the general formula EMI15.1 wherein n, nl, R, R1, and X are as defined hereinafore.Preferred linear carbonate polymers containing at least one repeating structural unit of Formula IV are those wherein X is selected from monocyclic cycloalkylidene radicals containing from 10 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, preferably from 11 to about 16 ring carbon atoms, and more preferably from 12 to about 16 ring carbon atoms. In order for the polycarbonates of the instant invention to exhibit improved heat resistances it is critical that at least one halogen atom be present on at least one of the aromatic rings of the recurring strutural unit represented by Formula IV, i.e., that the sum of n plus n be at least one. These high molecular weight linear aromatic carbonate polymers generally have a number average molecular weight from about 5,000 to about 200,000, preferably from about 10,000 to about 100,000. Also included hwrwin are the thermoplastic randomly branched polycarbonates. These randomly branched polycarbonates may be prepared by the reaction of i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, and iii a minor amount o.f a polyfunctional organic compound. The polyfunctional organic compound is generally aromatic in nature and functions as a branching agent.

Although the instant polycarbonates exhibit some degree of flame retardancy, and those polycarbonates derived from tetrahalogenated dihydric phenols are flame retardant per se, they may nevertheless have admixed therewith flame retardant additives to improve their flame reta rdant properties. Some particularly useful flame retardants include the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulfonic acids. These types of flame retardants are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,775,367 3,836,490 3,933,374 3,948,851 3,926,908 3,919,167 3,909,490 3 953, 396 3,831,100 3,978,024 3,953,399 3,917,559 3,951,810 and 3,940,366, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In general the polyalkyl acrylates described in Bnnkinann et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,591,659, incorporated by reference, can be used, especially those containing units derived from alkyl acrylates, particularly n butyl acrylate. Acrylate containing copolymers wherein the other monomer is, for example, derived from a methacrylate are also readily employable, see for example Japanese Patent Application Announcement 1968 18611, incorporated by preference.Preferably the acrylate resin will be in the form of a rubber elastic graft copolymer having a glass transition temperature below about 20 C, preferably below about 40 C.

Styrene containing polymers can also be employed as impact modifiers of the instant polycarbonates.Examples of such polymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, styrent acrylonitrile, methacrylatebutadiene styrene, and the like. Any minimum quantity of impact modifier which positively upgrades the impact strength of the polycarbonates of the instant invention can be employed.Greater than this minimum quantity may be employed so long as the properties desired for a particular appThcation of the instant polycarbonates are sub stantially maintained. Generally a minimum of two weight percent is sufficient to observe an increase.A minimum of about four weight percent is preferredA ievel of about 15 weight percent, preferably about 10 weight percent, generally should not be exceeded. Weight percent is measured as the amount of impact modifier in the total of impact modifier plus polycarbonate resin, Another embodiment of the instant invention is carbonate copolymer obtained by reacting i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydrlc phenol of Formula I, and iii at least one dihydric phenol represented by the general formulaEMI20.1 w nerein This independently selected from halogen, monovalent hydrocarbon1 and monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals a is independently sel ected from whole numbers having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive b is either zero or one and A is selected from alkylene radicals, alkylidene radicals1 cycloalkylene and cycloalkylidene radicals containing from k to 6 ring carbon atoms, EMI21.1 The preferred halogen radicals represented by R are chlorine and bromine.

These copolyester carbonates contain ester bonds and carbonate bonds in the polymer chain, wherein the amount of ester bonds is from about 25 to about 90 mole percent, preferably from about 35 to about 80 mole percent. For example, 5 moles of bisphenol A reacting completely with 4 moles of isophthaloyl dichloride and one mole of phosgene would give a copolyester carbonate of 80 mole percent ester bonds. Conventional copolyester carbonates in general, and methods for their preparation, are disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,t69,121 , which is hereby incorporated by reference In general, any difunctioanl carboxylic acid conventionally used in the preparation of linear polyesters may be utilized in the preparation of the linear copolyester carbonate resins of the present invention. The carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, aln3hatic aromatic carboxylic acids, and aromatic carboxylic acids. These acids are disclosed in the alo ementioned U.S. Patent 3,169,121. The difunctional carboxylic caids which may be utilized in the preparation of the copolyester carbonates of the instant invention generally conform to the general formula VII. R3 R4 q COOR q wherein R4 is an alkylene, alkylidene, aralkylene, aralkylidene or cycloalphatic group containing ethylenic unsaturation an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, and the like two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as alkylene or alkylidene groups and the like. R3 is either a carboxyl group or a hydroxyl group. The letter q represents one where R is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one where R3 is a carboxyl group. Preferred difunctional carboxylic acids are the aromatic difunctional carboxylic acids, i.e., those acids of Formula VII where q is one, R3 is 4.a carboxyl or hydroxyl group, and R4 is an aromatic group such as phenylene, naphthylene, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, and the like. The preferred aromatic difunctional carboxylic acids are those represented by the general formulaEMI27.1 wherein is as defined above R5 is independently selected from halogen radicals, monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals and p represents a whole number having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive. The preferred radicals represented by R5 are the same as those disclosed for Rê hereinafore. Mixtures of two or more different difunctional carboxylic acids may be employed as well as individual difunctional carboxylic acids. Therefore, where the term difunctional carboxylic acid is used herein it is meant to include mixtures of two or more different difunctional carboxylci acids as well as individual difunctional carboxylic acids. Particularly useful aromatic difunctional carboxylic acids are isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and mixtures thereof. Rather than utilizing the difunctional carboxylic acids per se it is preferred to employ their ester forming reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides. Particularly useful acid halides are the acid chlorides. Thus, for example, instead of using isophthalic acid, tere phthalic acid, or mixtures thereof it is preferred to utilize isophthaloyl dichloride, terephthaloyl dichloride, or mixtures thereof. A particularly useful mixture of isophthaloyl dichloride and terephthaloyl chloride is one wherein the weight ratio of isophthaloyl dichloride to terephthaloyl dichloride is in the range of from 1 10 to 9.8 0.2. The instant copolyester carbonate resins may be prepared by any of the known conventional means such as solution polymerization, melt polymerization, transesterification, and the like.One of the methods of preparing the copolyestercarbonates of this invention involves the heterogeneous polymerization system utilizing an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent, at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, at least one difunctional carboxylic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof, a catalyst, a molecular weight regulator, and a carbonate precursor. A preferred heterogeneous interfacial polymerization system is one which.utilizes phosgene as the carbonate precursor and methylene chloride o chlorobenzene as the organic solvent. The reacting conditions, catalysts, and chain terminators or molecualr weight regulators utilized are generally the same as those used in the preparation of conventional prior art copolyestercarbonates and are well known to those skilled in the art. The linear copolyester carbonate resins of the instant invention may also optionally contain admixed therewith the various additives described supra, particularly an impact modifying amount of at least one impact modifier.

It is intended that the examples be considered as illustrative rather than limiting the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. In the examples all parts and percents are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. The following example illustrates the preparation of a dihydric phenol intermediate which is halogenated to produce the dihydric phenols of the instant invention. This dihydric phenol falls outside the scope of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane intermediate used in the preparation of the instant dihydric phenols. To a 3 liter round bottom flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer and gas inlet tube, there are charged 1647 grams 17.4 moles of phenol, 478 grams 2.62 moles of cyclododecanone, and 15 milliliters of n butyl mercaptan. Heat is applied via a heating mantel and when the reaction mixture becomes liquid at 58 C andhydrous hydrogen chloride is introduced.until the solution becomes saturated. Stirring is continued between 52 60 C for several hours, during which period white solids begin to separate out from the reddish orange reaction mixture. When gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the slurry indicates the absence of the macrocyclic ketone, the warm reaction slurry is filtered by suction and the resultant filter cake is washed with methylene chloride.The filter cake is the slurried up with fresh methylene chloride, is filtered and is rinsed with more solvent. Analysis by gas chromatography of the dried filter cake, which weighs 849.8 garms 2.41 moles , corresponding to a 920 yield, and melts as 207 208.5 C, indicates that it has a retention time of 26.07 minutes realtive to p cumyl phenol which emerges at 13.91 minutes. The following examples illustrate the prep ration of the dihydric phenols of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the preparation of 1,1 bis 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane. To a slurry containing 10 grams 0.0284 mole of 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane, prepared substantially in accordance with the procedure ofExample l, and 50 milliliters of methylene chloride there is added, dropwise, a solution containing 19.0 grams 0.1135 mole of bromine and 10 milliliters of methylene chloride. The addition of this solution is carried out while maintaining the temperature of the slurry at 23 C and with stirring. As the bromine addition progresses the slurry turns to a solution. Upon further progression of the bromine addition this solution turns, into a.slurry. The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When analysis of these samples indicates the absence of the 1,1 bis 4 hydr oxyphenyl cyciododecane the slurry is filtered by suction and the resultant solids are rinsed with methylene chloride. The solids are recrystallized from methanol. The solids which are 1,I bis 3, 3 dibromo 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclo dodecane,have a melting point of 269 271 C, and have a gas chromatographic retention time of 31.98 minutes relative to p cumyl phenol which emerges at 14.01 minutes.

To a slurry containing 10 grams 0.0284 mole of 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane, prepared substantially in accordance with th e procedure ofExample 1, and 50 milliliters of methylene chloride, there is slowly added, at a temperature of 25 27 C and with stirring, a solution containing 26 grams 0.19 mole of sulfuryl chloride and 20 milliliters of methylene chloride. During the addition of this solution the slurry turns to a solution. The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When analysis of these samples indicates the absence of the 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane the solution is stripped on a rotary evaporator under water aspirator vacuum.Analysis of the solids indicates that they contain 93.6 of l,l bis 3 chloro 4hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane 6 of l 4 hydroxy phenyl ,1 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane and O.47c of l 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl ,l 3,5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane. The solids are recrystallized from methanol to yield the pure 1,1 bis 3 chloro 4 hydro xypheny 1 cyclododecane, which has a melting point of 167 l690C and a gas chromatpgraphic retention time of 28.04 minutes relative to 13.97 minutes for p cumyl phenol.

To a slurry containing 2.5 grams 0.0066 mole 1,1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane and 50 milliliters of methylene chloride there is slowly added, at 230C and with stirring, a solution containing 3 36 grams 0 091 mole bromine and 10 milliliters ofmethylene chloride. During addition of this solution the slurry turns into a solution.The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture.When analysis of these samples indicates the absence of 1,1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane the solution is stripped on a rotary evaporator under water aspirator vacuum. The resultant solids are recrystallized from methanol. The resulting white crystals have a melting point of 237 238 C and a gas chromatographic retentron time of 29.71 minutes relative to a retention time of 14.01 minutes for p cumyl phenol.

During the addition of this solution the slurry turns into a solution. The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When analysis of these samples indicates the absence of 1, 1 bis C3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane the solution is stripped on a rotary evaporator under water aspirator vacuum. The resultant solids are recrystallized from methanol. These recrystallized solids have a melting point of 213 215 C and a gas chromatographic retention time of 28.76 minutes relative to a retention time of 14.04 minutes for p cumyl phenol.
