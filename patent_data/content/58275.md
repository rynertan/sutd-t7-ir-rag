## Description
HOLLOW FIBER ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to hollow fiber artificial kidneys and, more particularly to an improvement in fabricating hollow fiber artificial kidneys which performs hemodialysis with substantially no potential risk for the blood to come in contact with air 2. Description of the Prior Art A typical hollow fiber artificial kidney commonly known in the art is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the Figs a plurality of hollow fibers l are bundled together and potted at each end in headers 2,2 such that the fibers 1 secured at the both ends in headers 2,2 are accommodated within a cylindrical shell 3.The hollow fiber is made fro such as cellulose based material and has a wall thickness of 16p and an inner diameter of 215p. The headers 2,2 are made from a hardened resin such as silicone or polyuret while the shell 3 is made from transparent material such as polycarbonate. The cylindrical shell 3 has diametrically enlarged portions 4,4 adjacent the both ends where dialysate inlet and outlet ports 5,5 are integrally formed to permit the introduction and withdrawing of the dialysate solution substantially peripherally to the hollow fibers 1 within the shell 3. After potting the fibers 1 in the headers 2 which are also fixedly held in a liquid tight manner to the interior of the shell 3 at the enlarged portion 4, the surface of the fibers 1, headers 2 and bottom and top edges of the shell 3 are made flush with one another. There are provided lids 6,6 at the both ends of the cylindrical shell 3 where the interior of the hollow fibers 1 are exposed or faced open, blood outlet and inlet ports 7,7 being formed centrally of the lids 6,6 in order to permit entry of blood into the interior of the hollow fibers 1 and to enable the withdrawal of the blood after dialysis.The lids 6 are tightly abutted at its peripheral portion onto the surface of the headers 2 and bottom and top edges of the shell 3 in a fluid tight manner. The lids 6 are secured to the shell 3 and headers 2 by covers 8 which are tightened with threads 9 formed both at the outer surface of the shell 3 and the inner surface of the covers 8, respectively. These conventional hollow fiber artificial kidneys have been found not entirely satisfactory, however, in that, since the lids 6,6 lying upon the flush surface of the headers 2,2 and top and bottom edges of the shell 3 are tightened with threads 9 formed on the both interior and exterior surfaces of the respective covers 8 and shells 35 forces imparted on the threads 9 may loosen the tightness between the lids 7 and the flush surface of the headers 2, and top and bottom edges of the shell 3 thus resulting in a leakage of the blood and in a contact with air which causes a potential infection. It is therefore a principal object to provide a holl fiber artificial kidney whose construction substantially eliminates a leakage of blood and a contact with air thus avoiding a hazardous infection. Briefly, a hollow fiber artificial kidney according to the invention comprises a shell in which a plurality c hollow fibers are accommodated, and a pair of cover membi or lids for attaining a communication with the blood flos through each hollow fiber and fluid tightly covering the shell. The cover members are welded to couple with the shell, in a preferred embodiment, by ultrasonic weldingIn addition, a groove is formed within the respective co members in. which a sealing material is fitted further to avoid a contact of the blood with air. More in particular, a hollow fiber artificial kidne of the invention is characterised in that the cover mexnt are comprised of external depending walls integrally fox at the peripheral edges thereof for being coupled with t end portions of the shell and internal depending walls parallel to and spaced apart from the external depending walls extending toward the top edges of the headers and being substantially in contact therewith thereby forming grooves between the external and internal walls, sealing members are provided which are fitted within the grooves, and the inner surfaces of the external walls are coupled with the both end portions of the shell be means of welding.The sealing members prevents the blood in head chambers, defined between the blood inlet and outlet ports and the tips of the hollow fibers, from communicating with air through the welded portions between the external walls and the end portion of the shell. The sealing members may preferably be O rings or other suitable material such as polyurethane. Thus, in a hollow fiber artificial kidney of the invention provided is a twofold preventive measure for a contact of blood with air which is constituted by the welded portions between the cover members and the shell, and the sealing members fitted within the grooves. According to the invention the hollow fiber artificial kidney thus constructed is free from any potential hazards which might have been caused by a contact of blood with air. Many other advantages and features of the present invention will become manifest to those versed in the art upon making reference to the detailed description and the accompanying sheets of drawings in which preferred structual embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of example. Fig. 1 is an elevational view in section of a hollow fiber artificial kidney according to the prior art Fig. 2 is a plan view of the hollow fiber artificial kidney seen in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an elevational view in section of a first embodiment of a hollow fiber artificial kidney according to the invention Fig. 4 is a fragmentary elevational view, on an enlarged scale, of a portion of the hollow fiber artificial kidney seen in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is an elevational view in section of a second embodiment of a hollow fiber artificial kidney according to the invention and Fig. 6 is a fragmentary elevational view, on an enlarged scale, of a portion of the hollow fiber artificia kidney seen in Fig. 5. Referring to Figs 3 and 4, a first embodiment of a hollow fiber artificial kidney according to the present invention is shown in which identical reference numerals with those in Figs. 1 and 2 designate like or correspondin parts throughout and the description thereof is omitted for the purpose of brevity. In this embodiment, a shell 3 generally of a cylindrical shape is formed to have diametrically enlarged portions 4 at the both ends and headers 2 are fixedly connected to the outward portion, away from the middle of the shell 3, of the diametrically enlarged portion 4 to form joints indicated at 20 between the outer surfaces of the headers 2 and the inner surfaces of the shell 3.There are provided buffle plates 21 respectively at the bases of dialysate inlet and outlet ports 5 which are formed integrally with the shell 3 and located inwardly toward the middle of the shell 3 adjacent to the joints 20. The buffle plates 21 deflect dialysate solution so as to spread it uniformly throughout the hollow fibers 1. In the first embodiment of the invention, cover members generally designated at 23 are coupled with the end portions of the shell 3 and have blood inlet and outlet ports 7 formed centrally thereof. The cover members 23 define header chambers 24 between the blood inlet and outlet ports 7 and the tips of the hollow fibers 1 for diverging the blood to be dialysed toward the hollow fibers 1 and converging the blood dialysed into the blood outlet port 7. The cover members 23 are comprised of external depending walls 25 integrally formed at the peripheral edges thereof for coupling with the end portions of the shell 3, and internal depending walls 26. The internal depending walls 26 are formed such that they are parallel to and spaced apart from the external depending walls 25 and extend toward the top edges of the headers 2 so as to be substantially in contact with the top edges. Thus, grooves 27 are formed between the external and internal depending walls 25 and 26. It is to be noted in this embodiment that the inner surfaces of the external depending walls 25 are coupled with the end portions of the shell 3 by means of welding, preferably by ultrasonic welding. The inner surfaces of the external depending walls 25 and the end portions of the shell 3 are formed substantially in a stepwise manner as shown in the drawings for securing them in position.Sealing members made of O rings 28 are provided within the grooves 27 for preventing the blood in the header chambers 24 from communicating with air through the welded portions 29 between the external depending walls 25 and the end portion of the shell 3. As apparent from the above description the embodiment of the hollow fiber artificial kidney is provided a twofold preventive measure for a contact of the blood with air which is attained by the provision of the welded portions 29 between the cover members 23 and the shell 3 and in addition the sealing member, i.e., O rings 28 fitted within the grooves 27. Consequently, any potential hazards are prevented from occurring which might have been caused by a contact of blood with air. Referring now to Figs. 5 and 6, a further modification of the present invention is shown in which identical reference numerals with those in Figs. 1 to 4 designate likf or corresponding parts throughout. The differences between the first embodiment and this modification reside only in that O rings 27 in Figs. 3 and 4 are removed from the grooves 27 and instead sealing material such as polyurethane 30 is filled within the entire space of the grooves 27. A pair of injection hole and air evacuating hole 31 are formed on the external depending walls 25, both of which are located diametrically opposite to each other and in communication with the grooves 27, the former serving as inlet for sealing material and the latter serving as outlet for air for avoiding the formation of voids within the sealing material. Since the shell 3 and the covering members 23 are made of polycarbonate, it is preferable to use the same material in filling the holes 31 aftetr hardening the sealing material 30. In this second embodiment, it is readily understood that the same effect is attained as in the first embodiment in Figs. 3 and 4. Thus a leakage of the blood and hence a contact of the blood with air is fully eliminated thus assuring the hollow fiber artificial kidney entirely free of potential blood infection.
