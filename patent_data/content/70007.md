# Internal combustion engine with bearing beam structure.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine 10 comprises a cylinder block 12 having at its bottom part a plurality of bearing sections 16 and a bearing beam structure 18 including a plurality of main bearing cap sections 20 each of which associates with the cylinder block bearing section to rotat ably support a crankshaft, first and second beam sections 22A, 22B . for securely connecting all the bearing cap sections 20 and extending parallel with the axis N of the crankshaft, the distance D between the outer most side surfaces 22a, 22b of the first and second beam sections 22A, 22B being equal to or smaller than the width W of each bearing cap section 20 , and at least four cap bolts 24, 26 for fastening each bearing cap section 20 onto the cylinder block 12 , thereby effectively suppressing the vibration of the bearing beam structure 18 itself and accordingly the vibration of the lower part of the cylinder block 12 .
