# Method of providing an increased brightening effect and silver halide photographic material having increased brightening effect.

## Abstract
A silver halide color photographic material having improved whiteness and a method of processing said material are disclosed. The material is formed on a hyd rophobic support at least one silver halide emulsion layer, a layer containing a brightening agent and a layer containing a compound that is capable of trapping the brightening agent, said layer containing a compound capable of trapping the brightening agent being separate from the layer containing the brightening agent and positioned more remote from the support than the latter layer, and also, the method for providing enhanced brightening effect comprises subjecting said material to imagewise exposure and color development so that said brightening agent is diffused into and trapped by the layer containing capable of trapping the brightening agent.
