## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for the precision grinding of spherical lenses of medium and small diameter, and has as its object to operatively synchronise and fully automate the respective steps of feeding, grinding and removing the lenses, and conveying and positioning the lenses in such steps. Conventional lens grinding apparatus can be largely divided into two kinds depending on whether a holder shaft continuously presses the sphere center of a grinding dish, or not. The present invention relates to the former apparatus, wherein lenses are usually ground by being swung with the sphere center of the grinding dish as a center. In this type of apparatus, there is a system wherein the grinding dish is swung with the sphere center of the dish as a center and a system wherein the holder shaft is swung with the sphere center of the dish as a center. In the latter system the adjustment of the machine is very difficult, with the result that the angle will vary due to setting up errors, the lens may be pressed through being unbalanced, the reproducibility of the lens radius R may be low, the grinding dish may be worn through being unbalanced, and the grinding dish radius R and swinging state may have to be frequently readjusted. Although in the case of concave lenses there may be few such problems, in the case of convex lenses there have been many problems. Also, in these methods, as the holder shaft the upper shaft is swung, the control mechanisms in the structure are complicated and the stability of the machine is low. Therefore, a method wherein the grinding dish is swung about the spherical center of the dish has come to be adopted. However, in this method, as the entire grinding box is swung like a pendulum through the rotation of a cam or crank, usually by means of a motor or the like, the weight of the entire box swung by the rotating angle of the cam or crank is added, with the result that the swinging speed becomes unstable and the swinging frequency is difficult to increase. As a result, there will be produced the following defects Further, in the conventional lens grinding systems, as only one lens can be ground at once, the working efficiency is low, and moreover, as the working steps of conveying, feeding and removing the lenses are carried out by hand, it is impossible to grind many lenses at once. In preferred forms of the present invention, in order to obviate or at least reduce such problems as are mentioned above US A 3775909 discloses an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1, hence an automatic lens grinding apparatus comprising a lens feeding part for feeding, in turn, work receptacles for containing respective lenses to be ground to a lens precision grinding and cutting assembly by means of conveying means, the said lens precision grinding and cutting assembly having conveying and positioning means consisting of a plurality of lens holders such that lenses in respective work receptacles are conveyed into and positioned in respective grinding dishes, a lens grinding assembly having a plurality of grinding tanks into which the lenses are conveyed, positioned and ground by feeding, grinding and discharging means. According to the present invention which is defined in claim 1, the apparatus is characterised in that the lens feeding part is arranged to automatically feed the work receptacles, there is provided a lens removing part for washing the ground lenses in a water tank, the conveying means is in the form of a belt conveyor which conveys the work receptacles which are independently movable relative to said conveyor and in that vacuum means are provided for retaining and releasing lenses in and from respective lens holders of said lens precision grinding and cutting assembly and said lens grinding assembly, the vacuum means being such that said lenses are retained in said lens holders by a sucking action caused by the vacuum means acting on said lenses. Two embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the entire mechanism of an automatic lens grinding apparatus according to the present invention. The apparatus comprises a lens feeding part A, a lens precision grinding and cutting assembly B, a lens grinding assembly C, and a lens removing part D. The feeding part A is a mechanism for feeding work receptacles W respectively containing lenses in turn by means of a belt conveyor. The precision grinding and cutting assembly B is a mechanism for vertically moving and rotating four basic shafts in turn to precisely grind the lenses in a cycle of pellet processing thickness measuring , radius R comparing and measuring, resin processing and discharging steps. The lens grinding assembly C is a device for vertically moving and rotating two basic shafts to grind the precision ground lenses in the simultaneous steps of feeding, grinding and discharging them. The lens removing part D includes a device for shower washing the lenses after being completely ground. The lens conveying belt conveyers V1, V2 and V3 are continuously and automatically controlled. The grinding methods and devices of the precision grinding and cutting assembly B and the grinding assembly C are identical with each other. Figs. 2 and 3 show the lens precision grinding and cutting assembly B of the apparatus. In this machine assembly B, four lens conveying and positioning devices S rotating at a pitch of 1 4 rotation are arranged in the form of a cross so as to be rotated at a pitch of 90 degrees on the periphery, to move in turn past lens grinding machines arranged at three locations.1 is a holder shaft fitted at its tip with one said lens conveying and positioning device S. This holder shaft 1 is inserted and fitted in a holder sleeve 2 through bearing sleeves 3 and is locked at the upper end by a shaft holding nut 5 which is resiliently connected by a spring 6 to a wing bolt 8 fitted to a base member 4. 9 is a crank lever and 10 is a grinding dish. The purpose of the crank lever 9 is to vertically position a grinding holder arm 7. 13 is a central shaft. A loading table 11 is fitted on a loading arm 12 with this central shaft 13 as an axis. The loading arm 12 is fitted with four of said lens conveying and positioning devices S. 21 is an air tube connected to a vacuum distributor 20 at the upper end of the central shaft 13 and connected at its other end to the lens conveying and positioning device S. Further, the air tube 21 communicates with a vacuum generator through the interior of the center shaft and an air tube 21a. Further, the central shaft 13 is fixed to a base 28 through a sliding sleeve 16 and bearings 18. 23 is another sleeve fitted at its lower end with a timing pulley 17 connected to shaft 13 through a key 15. This timing pulley 17 is operatively connected to a driving motor 25 through a timing belt 24 and is vertically movable relative to the central shaft 13 along a key way 14, so as to rotate the center shaft 13 when the loading table 11 is to rise, and thus to turn the loading table 11. Further, an air cylinder 27 is connected through a cylinder knuckle 26 to the lower end of the central shaft 13 so as to vertically move the entire loading table 11. That is to say, this loading table 11 will remain lowered when the lenses are to be ground, but will rise and simultaneously turn to convey the lenses when the lenses are to be conveyed. 19 is a table fitting nut and 22 is a rotary air joint. The important parts of the lens conveying and positioning device S will now be described with reference to Fig. 3 b . 30 is a piston mounted on a holder shaft 29, having packings 38 and a sliding metal sleeve 31 and secured by piston locking nuts 39. 32 is a cylinder tube fitted to the holder shaft 29. Compressed air H and vacuum air I for sucking the lenses are able to flow into and out of cylinder tube 32 through air joints 33 and 40. On the upper part of the cylinder tube 32 a cylinder head 34 is provided, with an internal bearing metal sleeve 35 and a packing 36. 41 and 42 are O rings. 43 is a lens holder head. 46 is a center lock nut of a rotatable central shaft 50 housed in the center of the holder shaft 29. 47 and 48 are respectively a radial bearing and a thrust bearing. 49 is a center nut. 51 is a center point. 45 is a grinding dish. 52 is a compression spring. 37 is a locking piece. The operation of the assembly B is as follows. First of all, in the case of grinding a lens L, the lens L on the grinding dish 45 is pressed by the holder shaft 29 of the grinding holder 44 and is ground by the rotation and swinging of the grinding dish 45. Then, the ground lens L is sucked to the grinding holder 44, and conveyed to a fixed place and removed. Thus, the lens L to be ground and conveyed is automatically fed, conveyed and removed, whilst being accurately and positively positioned. More particularly, in the case of grinding the lens L, when compressed air H is made to flow into the cylinder tube 32 and the cylinder tube is thereby moved upward along the holder shaft, the lower end part of the cylinder tube 32 separates from the holder head 43 of the grinding holder 44 until it contacts the piston locking nut 39. Then the grinding dish 45 swings and rotates to grind the lens L. Then, for conveying the lens after it has been ground, the compressed air H within the cylinder tube 32 is discharged, and the cylinder tube 32 is then pressed downward by the compression spring 52. By this downward movement, the lower end part of the cylinder tube 32 is separated from the piston locking nut 39 and sealingly engaged with the holder head 43. By this engagement of the grinding holder 44 with the cylinder tube 32, the vacuum air I is made to communicate with the grinding holder 44 so as to set up a vacuum state whereby the lens L on the grinding dish 45 is sucked to the grinding holder 44. Figs. 4 and 5 show a grinding dish swinging device, a grinding holder pressing device, and automatic grinding measuring device, which are important parts of the lens grinding assembly C. A denotes a grinding dish swinging device. 55 is a swinging post connecting a swinging cylinder 54 with a spindle 61. 56 is the swinging post bearing. 57 is a cylinder foot supporting the swinging cylinder 54 through a pin 58. 59 is a spindle motor operatively connected to the spindle 61 through a V pulley 60. The spindle 61 is connected to a grinding dish 64 through the interior of a sleeve 62. That is to say, when the spindle motor 59 is rotated, the spindle 61 will be rotated to rotate the grinding dish 64. 66 is a grinding holder which presses the lens L against the grinding dish 64. 63 is a sleeve base and 65 is a bearing. B denotes the grinding measuring device wherein, when the grinding holder 66 is placed on the grinding dish 64 and the measured value of grinding is determined, as soon as the grinding dish 64 is rotated, the entire box will be swung. On the other hand, as the grinding holder 66 is pressed through the holder shaft 67, the lens L located between the grinding dish 64 and grinding holder 66 will be automatically ground. In such case, when grinding has proceeded to the graduation of a dial gauge 73 at which the measured value is set, once the needle S reaches the graduation of the measured value, the grinding dish 64 will automatically stop rotating. That is to say, if the lens L is to be ground by a thickness M, an adjusting bolt 71 will move downward a distance M and will press a measuring terminal 74 by the same distance M whereby the lens will be ground by the measured value of M. 68 is a holder arm, 69 is a mounting plate, 70 is a mounting arm for the adjusting bolt 71, 72 is a spring, and 75 is an adjusting screw. Now, the arrangement for swinging the grinding dish will be explained with reference to Fig. 5. First of all, if the grinding dish is swung to an extent whereby the center line of its swinging base is inclined by about 15 to 20 degrees to the vertical, when swinging upward the swinging base will always be able to be lifted by the same force, irrespective of the amount of extension of the piston rod of the cylinder 54. On the other hand, when swinging downward, the discharging speed of the cylinder 54 can be able to be freely set to come to any desired position by suitable adjustment. In the case of an air cylinder, near the swing turning point at 0 degrees, the air cylinder will be swingable very freely, like a pendulum, to reduce shocks, and the swinging angle and amplitude can be adjusted by a handle operation from the outside, without putting a hand into the machine. Fig. 6 shows a method of conveying lenses with the precision grinding and cutting assembly B of the apparatus. 77 is a cylinder for vertical motion. 79 is a cylinder for opening and closing. The cylinder 77 is fitted between bases 76 and 78. A loading chuck 80 is connected to the piston rod of the cylinder 79 and is further fixed to the base 78 through a boss 81. 82 is an adjusting bolt for adjusting the level of the loading chuck 80. 83 is a first belt for conveying the work receptacles W by means of the belt conveyer. 84 and 85 are cylinders for separating the work receptacles W one by one. The operation of the apparatus of Fig. 6 will be explained with the aid of the flow chart of Fig. 10 a . First of all, the starting switch of the precision grinding and cutting assembly B is switched on and the first belt 83 is thereby actuated to convey the work receptacles W, fed from the lens feeding part A, in turn to the loading position P. The respective cylinders 84 and 85 are effective to feed the work receptacles W one by one to the loading position P. That is to say, by the alternate operation when one extends, the other will contract of the cylinders 84 and 85, the work receptacles W will be fed one by one. When a work receptacle W arrives at the loading position P, the first belt 83 will stop for a while. When a work receptacle W is thus stopped in the loading position P, the cylinders 77 and 79 for raising and lowering the base and for opening and closing the chuck will be operated to move the loading chuck 80 to the loading position P, chuck the work receptable W and convey it toward the precision grinding and cutting assembly B. In removing the ground lens, the operation is the reverse of that just described. Fig. 7 shows lens grinding assembly C of the apparatus in detail. A sliding bed body 86 includes a vertical shaft 88 carrying a sliding arm 89 within a sliding base 87 for forward and rearward movement. 91 is an air cylinder for vertically moving the sliding arm 89 on the shaft 88. The sliding arm 89 is fitted to the shaft 88 through a bearing metal sleeve 90 and carries a bolt 98 for setting the vertical stroke. Further, the sliding base 87 is mounted via a bearing metal sleeve on a horizontal shaft 93 for moving forward and rearward. The sliding base 87 is connected to an air cylinder 95 mounted on a base 97. 96 is a flange supporting the rear end of shaft 93, whilst 99 is a flange for its front end. 101 is a belt chute mounted on a base 100 and provided with a first belt 102 and second belt 103. 104 are grinding tanks aligned with the lens holders provided at the opposite ends of the sliding arm 89. Thus the sliding bed body 86 will move forward and rearward along the shaft 93 upon the extension and contraction of the air cylinder 95. On the other hand, the sliding arm 89 provided with the lens grinding holders is movable vertically along the shaft 88 by means of the air cylinder 91. By such vertical movement and forward and rearward movement, the lenses L fed from the respective belts 102 and 103 can be automatically and continuously sucked, ground and then discharged by the lens grinding holder. 92 is a sliding base and 98 is a bolt. Now, the operation of this mechanism will be explained with reference to the flow chart of Fig. 10 b . First of all, when the work receptacles W are fed in turn onto the first belt 102, the receptacles will be arranged in turn in a line by means of a work guide 105. Then, by the operation of a first gate G1 and a second gate G2, the work receptacles W of A will be moved to the second belt 103 and the lenses L will be able to be fed to the loading position P1 of the lens grinding assembly C. On the other hand, when the work receptacles W to be fed to the first belt 102 can no longer be accommodated on the work guide 105, they will be moved to the near side and will be arranged in turn on the work guide 106. There, in the same as is described above, by the operation of a first gate G3 and a second gate G4, the work receptacles W will be moved in turn C , D to the second belt 103 and the lenses will be able to be fed to the loading position P2. In the loading positions P1 and P2, due to the vertical operation of the sliding arm 89, the lens grinding holders fitted to the sliding bed body 86 will advance and lower, will suck the lens L from the work receptacle W, will again rise and retreat, will be moved to the position of the grinding dish fitted to the grinding tank 104, and there the lens L will be automatically ground. After being completely ground the lens will be discharged, by an operation the reverse of that mentioned above, into the work receptacle and will be removed together with the work receptacle W by the belt 103. Fig. 8 shows the lens removing part D of the present apparatus. This lens removing part D includes means for washing the lenses L with a shower after they have been ground. 107 is a water tank in which a rotatable shaft 110 is supported by a bearing 108. The shaft 110 is fitted with a turntable 109 located in the water tank 107 and has a base 113 carrying the bearing 108 at its upper part. 112 is a motor mounted on the base 113. Lenses L carried by a third belt 115 deposited on the slowly rotating turntable 112 and are immersed in the water in the water tank 107. 111 is a coupling and 114 is a rotary shaft of the belt 115. The lens feeding part A of the apparatus comprises means for conveying and feeding the work receptacles W to the lens precision grinding and cutting assembly B, whereby the work receptacles W containing the lenses L may be arranged on the base, moved onto the feeding belt line by line, and conveyed in turn to the lens precision grinding and cutting assembly. Fig. 9 shows another embodiment of the lens conveying device. 116 is a holder base body set between a lens position determining device A and lens grinding and swinging device B. This holder base body 116 includes a holder shaft 118 having at one end with the lens position determining device A and at the other end a holder urging cylinder 119. The holder shaft 118 is supported from a base 117 by a holder sleeve 112. 120 and 121 are respectively a holder shaft bearing metal sleeve and holder sleeve bearing metal sleeve. 123 is a sleeve base through which the holder shaft 118 can slide and move vertically. 125 is a sleeve cylinder for sliding and moving the sleeve base 123 and is supported by cylinder bases 124 and 126. 128 is an air cylinder for vertically moving a loader assembly. 127 is a base. 129 is a loader assembly body located between the lens position determining device A and lens grinding and swinging device B. 131 is a loader arm of the loader assembly body 129, provided at one end with a lens receptacle 130 for containing a lens L, and resiliently mounted at the other end on a sliding shaft 132 through a compression spring 133, the shaft 132 being mounted from a movable shaft 135 by means of a loader holding piece 134. The loader assembly body 129 is connected to the movable shaft 135 so that the shaft is movable to right and left, whereby the loader assembly body 129 may be moved right and left continuously in turn. By this continuous movement of the loader assembly body 129, a lens L within the lens receptacle 130 can be conveyed in turn to the holder base body 116. 126 is a cylinder base. The operation of the apparatus of Fig. 9 may be explained as follows. First of all, a lens L contained within a lens receptacle 130 is fed to the loader assembly body 129. Then the moving shaft 135 is operated to move the loader assembly bodies 129 to the left one by one. The loader assembly body 129 is stopped for a while in the position at which the holder base body 116 is located, and the sliding shaft 132 is pushed upward by the air cylinder 128 to raise the lens receptacle 130 toward the lens position determining device A, to suck the lens L. At the same time, the sleeve cylinder 125 of the holder base body 116 is operated to depress the sleeve base 123, thereby to raise the holder shaft 118. When the lens L is thus sucked onto the holder base body 116, the moving shaft 135 will be again moved to the left and the lens L will be ground by the lens grinding and swinging device B. In such case, the lens L may be ground irrespective of the movement of the loader assembly body 129. When this operation is repeated in turn, lenses L will be continuously conveyed onto the grinding dish, to be ground. That is to say, when the holder bases 116 are arranged horizontally, the lenses may be simultaneously ground by the same operation at the same time. Further, when the moving shafts 135 are set in several lines and are repeatedly moved in turn to the right and left, a continuous operation is possible. It will thus be seen that, at least in its preferred and illustrated embodiments, apparatus according to the present invention has the following advantages
