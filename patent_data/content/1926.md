Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin.Such compositions will, in any event, contain a therapeutically effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the subject. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods well known in the art.For example, intermediates of the formulaEMI6.1 may be prepared in a manner analogous to that described in U.S. Patent 3,717,655 to Godefroi et al. This method comprises reacting a halomethyl naphthyl ketone with imidazole in an inert organic solvent. The starting halomethyl naphthyl ketones are lmo n or may be prepared by halogenation of the corresponding methyl naphthyl ketone by 1 noin means, for example, utilizing cupric bromide. The preparation of ketone intermediates by the above described method may be carried out in an inert organic solvent, for example, dimethyl formamide t a temperature between about 10 and 400C. Preparation of intermediates of the formula EMI7.1 may be accomplished by the reduction of the corresponding ketone or acid addition salt thereof under standard conditions, for example, by the use of sodium tetrahydroborate in a protic solvent, for example, methanol, at a temperature between about 20 and 20 C. Compounds of formula I wherein Z is esterified hydroxymethylene may be prepared under usual esterification conditions from the corresponding alcohol intermediate by treatment of the alcohol with the desired acid halide or anhydride in the presence of a base, preferably a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine, at a temperature between about 0 and 400C in a solvent such as pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, and the like. Certain compounds of formula I wherein Z is ketal protected carbonyl may be prepared from the corresponding ketone intermediate by treatment of the ketone or an acid addition salt thereof with the desired dihydric alcohol in the presence of a strong acid, for example a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride. Water is preferably removed as an azeotrope fth the solvent, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene, at a temperature sufficient to effect such azeotropic removal, e.g. from about 75e to about 1500C. Compounds of formula I wherein Z is thioketal protected carbonyl may be prepared from the corresponding ketone intermediate by treatment of the ketone or an acid addition salt thereof with the desired thiol or dithiol, optionally in the presence of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, an organic sulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid or a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride or zinc chloride at a temperature between about 0 and 100QC, preferably between about 0 and 250C. Compounds of formula I wherein Z is hemithioketal protected carbonyl may be prepared from the corresonding ketone intermediate or an acid addition salt thereof by treatment of the ketone with the desired mercaptioalkanol under conditions similar to those described above for ketal formation. Compounds of formula I wherein Z is ketalprotected carbonyl may also be prepared according to the following reaction sequence EMI9.1 wherein X is halo especially chloro or bromo , as described in U.S. 3,793,453 and 3,575,999 in the corresponding phenyl series. In this sequence the naphthyl methyl ketone is either first halogenated to the naphthyl halomethyl ketone, followed by ketalization or both steps are performed concurrently. Ketalization to form cyclic ketals may be performed essentially as described above. Ketalization to form acyclic ketals may be performed by employing an orthoester e.g. methyl orthoformate or ethyl orthoformate in the presence of an acid or Lewis acid, e.g. boron trifluoride, p toluenesulfonic acid, perch .oric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, and the like.The haloketal II is then converted to I by treatment with an alkali metal salt, e.g. the sodium salt, of imidazole, suitably in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimettgformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between about 20 and 1300C, Intermediates wherein the precursor of Z is hydroxymethylene may also be prepared according to the following reaction sequence EMI10.1 wherein the epoxide III or the halohydrin IV is treated with imidazole and or an alkali metal salt preferably the sodium salt thereof in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between about 0 and 1000C. Treatment of the epoxide requires one mole of imidazole in the presence of 0.05 1 mole of imidazole salt. Treatment of the halohydrin requires slightly over one mole of imidazole salt, since the halohydrin is first converted in situ to the epoxide. The subject compounds of formula I can be isolated as free bases however, since many of the compounds in base form are oils and gums and or not water soluble it is often more convenient to isolate and further characterize such compounds as acid addition salts. These salts are prepared in the usual manner, i.e., by reaction of the free base with a suitable inorganic or organic acid, for example one of the pharmaceutically acceptable acids described above. If desired, the salt can be readily converted to the free base by treatment with a base such as potassium or sodium carbonate or potassium or sodium hydroxide. In summary, another aspect of the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of a free base compound of the formulaEMI11.1 wherein Z is esterified hydroxymethylene, or ketal , hemithioketal or thioketal protected carbonyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salt thereof, which process comprises a the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Z is esterified hydroxymethylene by esterification of a compound of the formulaEMI11.2 or b the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Z is ketal protected carbonyl by ketalization of a compound of the formulaEMI11.3 or an acid addition salt thereof, or c the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Z is hemithioketal protected carbonyl by hemithioketalization of a compound of the formulaEMI12.1 or an acid addition salt thereof, or d the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Z is thioketal protected carbonyl by thioketalization of a compound of the formulaEMI12.2 or an acid addition salt thereof, or e the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Z is ketal protected carbonyl by reaction of a compound of the formulaEMI12.3 wherein X is halo, with an alkali metal salt of imidazole, and f optionally converting a free base to the corresponding acid addition salt, or g optionally converting an acid addition salt to the corresponding free base.
