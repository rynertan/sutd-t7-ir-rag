## Description
The present invention relates to stabilized and car ried red phosphorus fo use as flame retardant agent of mate rials on the basis of synthetic polymers. It is known that red phosphorus hereinunder indicated as red P is a very good flame retardant agent for ma ny materials on the basis of synthetic polymers. It is how ever known that red P in powder form creates during the various steps necessary for incorporating it into the above said materials severe problems of safety and environmen al hygiene, as the handling of said red P powder involves the danger of fires and explosions, as well as damagings of hygienic character, above all in that red P causes the appearance of phospine known to be very toxic , by reac tion with hydrogen containing substances, in particular, water. To the purpose of overcoming the said environmental hygiene and safety problems to a more or less complete ex tent, various methods have been proposed for the stabili zation or protection of red P, in particular by the en capsulation of red P and or the mixing thereof with various synthetic resins and or compounds of metals, in particular oxides. So e.g. the U.S. Patent 4,440,880 teaches to sta bilize red P in powder form by encapsulating the indivi dual particles thereof with a modified melamine resin, which resin is a melamine, formaldehyde, triethanolamine and methanol condensation product. The U.S. Patent 4,210,630 proposes in its turn the sta bilizing of red P by means of a protecting layer of alumi nium hydroxide in association with lead hydroxide, whilst the U.S. Patent 4,315,897 teaches to protect red P powder by coating the particles thereof with a thin layer of an oxidation stabilizer constituted by a combination of an ep oxy resin with aluminium hydroxide. Finally, the U.K. Pat ent 1,458,194 proposes the stabilizing of red P by coat ing its particles with an elastomer styrene butadiene co polymer . By the stabilization protection methods as indicated above given as typical examples illustrative of the known art , having available is hence possible red P in powder form with decreased drawbacks as for safety and environment al hygiene to the purpose of the incorporation thereof, as flame retardant agents, into materials on the basis of syn thetic polymers. Said problems of environmental hygiene are however solved by the known art to a limited extent only in fact, even if a red P powder is stabilized by a protective coat ing, the same powder e.g., containing particles with di mensions lower than 200 µm is partly dispersed into the surrounding atmosphere during the stages of processing of it, creating problems of environmental air pollution, de trimental for the human beings breathing, and with danger of fires and explosions by contact or friction with hot surfaces e.g. process equipment . To the purpose of obviating the aforesaid air pollu tion problem, the U.K. Patent 1,326,929 proposes red P pow der to be incorporated into a lactam preferably caprolac tam , thus forming a master batch of red P carried and pro tected inside caprolactam, which master batch is then used for the incorporation of red P into the polymeric ma terial mostly polyamide . This method suffers however from the drawback that the lactam must be recovered during the said incorporation step e.g., by vacuum extracion during the incorporation by extruder , to prevent said lac tam from remaining incorporated together with red P in to the polymeic material, consequently altering its physic al mechanical characteristics. Purpose of the present invention is hence to provide a stabilized carried red P powder, which avoids the above mentioned problems of the known art. This and still other purposes, which shall appear from the following disclosure, are achieved by means of a red P in the form of a protected powder, which red P , ac cording to the present invention, is constituted by par ticles encapsulated into synthetic resin, said particles being moreover aggregated to one another to form a plura lity of pellets and the like, each one of said pellets be ing constituted by a plurality of said particles kept bond ed to one another and coated by polyethylene having a den sity as expresed, in the folowing too, as g ml of 0.910 0.925, preferably about 0.913, and a melt index, as g 10 minutes, according to ASTM D 1238, Condition E , comprised within the range of from 55 to 150, preferably of about 70, said polyethylene constituting from 10 to 50 by weight of said pellets, the same polyethylene acting as the carrier for said red P, to the purpose of the incorpo ration thereof into materials based on synthetic polymers. To the purpose of accomplishing the said stabilized carried red P, various methods per se known can be used. As an instance, the encapsulating of the individual particles with synthetic resin can be carried out according to the method as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,440,880 whilst the forming of the pellets can be executed for instance by means of an extruder equipped with respectively up and downstream known mechanical mixing and granulating devices, as it is better disclosed in Example 1 below. The pellets so obtained can be regarded as a master batch with very high concentration of red P about from 50 to 90 by weight , the polyethylene acting as the aggre gating carrying substance for the encapsulated red P par ticles, which can be thus incorporated into the materials on the basis of synthetic polymers, without the drawbacks of the known art, the red P stabilized carried according to the invention resulting very stable chemically, and more over dust free. It must be noticed that the type of aggregating carry ing substance according to the invention and i.e., the po lyethylene having the above indicated characteristics is compatible with many and wide classes of polymeric mate rials, in particular besides polyolefins of course poly amides, such as polyamide 6 and polyamide 6,6 and the sa turated polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, and polybutylene terephthalate. This property wide compatibi lity spectrum is very important from the practical point of view, in that it allows, by using one single master batch type pellets or the like according to the invention , red P to be carried into many materials on the basis of synthetic polymers to cause the same to become self ex tinguishing in a simple and easy way, and without intro ducing negative changes as for the characteristics of the same materials. The said pellets being the object of the present in ventions have, preferably, average dimensions of the order of 2 to 5 mm, but both the dimensions and the shape of such pellets may be selected as desired relatively to the technical requirements. The amount of master batch or encapsulated carried red P according to the present invention to be incorpo rated in the materials based on synthetic polymers ranges from 5 to 30 by weight, according to the nature of the same, and of the degree of self extinguishability whose achievemnt is desired. As an instance, for the polyamides either compri sing or not comprising mineral reinforcing fillers, fiber glass and the like amounts of the order of 10 12 by weight are necessary to obtain a V O self extinguishability rating according to the UL 94 Standards Underwriter Labo ratories, U.S.A. . The fact is finally to be pointed out that, by using the red P masterbatch according to the present invention, obtaining is possible in a direct way, advantageously, shaped finished items, e.g., by means of an injection mould ing press and similar equipment for plastic melt shaping by feeding the same press, at the same time, respectively with the polymeric material to be made self extinguishing and with the red P master batch according to the present invention, by adopting the usual conventional techniques. The feeding as mentioned can be of course accomplished also by pre mixing with each other the two products as above said, which hence enter then the press as a mixture. The following Examples, given only to the purpose of exemplifying and not of limiting the invention, shall be useful to better illustrate the same invention. By following the directions of Example 1 of the U.S. Patent 4,440,880, red P in powder form is prepared with granulometry lower than 100 µm , stabilized by encapsula ting into modified melamine resin. Subsequently, by a high rate mixer of known vertical type, a mixture is prepared under inert atmosphere com prising by weight 75 of said red P in encapsulated powder form, and 25 of polyethylene powder Escorene MP 654 35 by ESSO CHIMICA S.p.a. of Milan , having a density of 0.913g ml, and a melt index of 70 melt index expresses in g 10 min utes, according to ASTM D 1238 Condition E . The said mixture is then brought to plastic melting in a single screw extruder and is then granulated to the form of small cylindrical pellets of 3 x 3 mm, represent ing the stabilized carried red P according to the invention also indicated hereinunder as red P master batch . During the processing as above, no processing draw backs are observed, and the end pellets so obtained appear as free flowing and easily measurable and, above all, with out any traces of dust. By using the same red P in encapsulated powder form of Example 1, inside a horizontal drum blender a mixture is prepared under inert gas comprising in by weight 85 of said red P and 15 of the same polyethylene as used in Example 1. The mixture obtained is then turned into spheric al pellets of about 3 mm in diameter, using a normal high temperature pelletizing conventional line of known type. In this case too, as in Example 1, no processing draw backs are to be met, and the end pellets are free flowing, easily measurable and dust free. Using a portion of the red P master batch as obtained in Example 1, in a blender extruder pelletizer line of known type the following plastic compositions are prepared in the form of cylindrical pellets of 3 3 mm amounts ex pressed as by weight For all the compositions as mentioned,by injection moulding both ASTM speciments for the mechanical tests ul timate tensile strength and elongation and specimens for the self extinguishability UL 94 test vertical specimen dimensions 152.4 12.7 .6 mm are prepared. The results of UL 94 test are sucessful in the sense that all the compositions as above mentioned appear to be self extinguishing with V O rating, while the results of mechanical tests demonstrate that no significant changes occur between specimens made self extinguishing by means of the incorporation into them of the red P master batch according to the invention, and specimens into which the same master batch has not been incorporated comparison spe cimens . An injection moulding press, of known type, equipped with a mould shaped according to the ASTM specimens for mechanical tests ultimate tensile strength and elongation is contemporaneously fed with polyamide 6,6 pellets and red P master batch it too in pellet form according to the present invention in the ratios by weight of 90 10 , in such a way finished items shaped according to the afore said ASTM specimens being obtained. Similar specimens comparison specimens are obtain ed in the same way by feeding the said press with the same polyamide 6,6 only. The mechanical tests carried out on the two specimens types yield results not significantly different from each other. To the invention, as it has hereinabove disclosed and exemplified, variations and or additions obvious for those skilled in the art can be made, without however going out of of the protection sphere of the same invention. Thus, e.g., into the red P master batch auxiliary substances con ventional for polymers may be incorporated, such as syn ergistic anfi flame additives, antistatics, stabilizers, antioxidants, lubricants and the like. Moreover, encapsulated carried red P can be clearly associated, according to the invention, to other flame retardant agents, to form compositions suitable to render self extinguishing various types of polymers, either as al ready herein previously mentioned to exemplified purposes, or not explicitly mentioned. Finally, inside the polyethylene term there must be included, according to the present invention, also the types of modified polyethylenes such as ethylene base co polymers, in particular ethylene vinyl acetate and ethyl ene acrylic ester copolymers, said copolymers containing at least 70 by weight of ethylene.
