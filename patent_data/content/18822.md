## Description
THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC POWER BY MEANS OF AMAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC GENERATOR The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the production of electric power by means of a magnetohydrodynamic MHD generator. Heretofore, there have been suggested various systems for utilizing MHD generators, for the production of electricity in general and, for the production of electricity by means of thermal electric power conversion, in particular. In a number of previously proposed systems, fuel was used to drive liquid metal through theMHD generator by means of plasma produced from fuel combustion, wherein the operating temperatures were relatively high, e.g., above 800 C. In U.S. Patent 3,453,462 there is proposed an MHDgenerator in which a nonconductive gas is heated, for example, by means of a nuclear reactor, to produce gas of high kinetic energy to drive liquid metal mist from a mixing chamber to a MHD generator in such proportions that the liquid metal coalesces into slugs of metal. The slugs of metal are separated by pockets of the nonconductive gas whose kinetic energy aids in the movement of the slugs through the MHD generator to generate electric current.After leaving the generator, the slugs are separated from the nonconductive gas. The liquid metal and the gas are recirculated by means of pumps through heat exchangers, to increase their respective kinetic energies. In addition to the fact that such slugs disintegrate and the metal adheres to the walls of the carrying duct, this system also suffers from the drawback that in order to circulate the separated gas, it is necessary to provide the circulating pump with a substantial amount of energy which, of course, greatly detracts from the efficiency of this system to the point of rendering the same uneconomical. It should also be mentioned that due to the fact that through the MHD generator there are passed slugs separated by pockets of gas, the generated electricity is in the form of a pulsating or intermittent D.C. and moreover, the electrical current which is produced is discontinuous, irregular and non predictable. In U.S. patent 3,443,129 there is proposed a vapourliquid cycle MHD power conversion system which operates by the use of fluids at low fluid velocities. It is proposed to drive, in a single loop system, a single substance, namely, an electrically conductive liquid by heating the same at one point along the loop, to form bubbles of the same substance, which bubbles will drive the liquid to a condenser. When condensed, the driven liquid continues to flow through an MHD generator either by a gravity force or by means of a pump. The liquid is then further directed to the heater to be reheated. As can be appreciated, this system must utilize a source of high temperature in order to heat up the liquid to its boiling point to form the driving bubbles and, also, through the MHD generator there is passed, at low velocity, only a single phase medium. While the previously proposed systems are capable of producing electric currents by the conversion of thermal energy into electricity utilizing an M tD generator, they are able to operate only at high temperatures which is very costly to produce. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for producing electrical power by means of a magnetohydrodynamic MHD generator, comprising heating a mixture of a liquid metal, and an organic liquid to form a two phase liquid metal vapour flow, directing said two phase liquid vapour through an MHDgenerator to generate electricity, condensing the vapour phase from said two phase liquid vapour to form liquid metal carrying organic liquid droplets, and recycling said liquid metal and organic liquid droplets to be reheated. Further according to the present invention, there is provided a method for producing electrical power by means of a magnetohydrodynamic MHD generator, comprises ing heating a mixture of electrically conduct ve liquid, and an organic liquid to form a two phase liquid vapour flow, directing said two phase liquid vapour through anMHD generator to generate electricity, condensing the vapour phase from said two phase liquid vapour to form conductive liquid carrying organic liquid droplets, and recycling said conductive liquid and organic liquid droplets to be reheated. Still further according to the invention, there is provided magnetohydrodynamic MHD apparatus for producing electrical power, comprising a closed duct system containing a mixture of electricallyconductive liquid, which is preferably liquid metal, and an organic liquid, heating means for heating the mixture in said closed system, said heating means preferably comprising a solar energy absorber, a magnetohydrodynamic MHD generator located along the flow path of a two phase conductive liquid vapour flow formed by the heated mixture, means for condensing the two phase flow to form a single phase of conductive liquid containing organic liquid droplets flow, and means for propelling said single phase flow to be reheated by said heating means, said propelling means preferably comprising an MHD pump. Still further according to the invention, there is provided apparatus for converting a solar energy into electricity and for heating a fluid, comprising a closed system containing a mixture of an electricallylconductive liquid and a low boiling temperature propelling organic liquid, solar energy absorbing means for heating said mixture to form a two phase flow, a magnetohydrodynamic MHD generator located along the path of the two phase flow, condensing and heat exchanging means for condensing said two phase flow into a single phase mixture of the electricallyveonductive liquid containing droplets of the propelling liquid and for heating a fluid circulating through the heat exchanging means, and means for propelling said single phase mixture to be reheated by said solar energy absorbing means. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an MHD apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of a modification of the apparatus of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of a further embodiment of an MHD apparatus according to the present invention. In the apparatus of Figure 1, there is provided a closed loop or duct system 2 for converting heat from a relatively low temperature heat source or low grade heating source, e.g., solar energy, into electrical current.The apparatus further comprises a heating device in the form of a solar absorber 4, which may be of any known type as, for example, of the flat collector type or of the more elaborate solar energy concentrator type. The interior of the solar absorber 4 is in fluid communication with a conduit 6 leading via an MHD generator 8 to a condenser 10. The interior of the condenser 10 is in fluid communication with a conduit 12 leading to the absorber 4 via a pump 14, e.g., an MHD pump. Optionally, between the pump 14 and the absorber 4, there is installed a fluid mixer or dispersing means 16, which may be constituted by a set of screens or by a plurality of vanes inside the conduit 12. The operation of the apparatus is as follows an electrically conductive liquid metal, e.g., Nak alloy eutectic, mercury, gallium or tin and an organic low boiling temperature propelling liquid, e.g. neohexane for Nak or freon or water for mercury, gallium or tin is introduced in the system forming a mixture of liquid metal and organic liquid. For avoiding phase separation and for the promoting of foaming, surfactant additives, e.g., carbon black, sulfur, selenium for Nak or magnesia for mercury, could optionally also be used. As the mixture of liquid metal and organic liquid is heated up by means of, for example, the solar energy absorber, when a plane collector or collectors are used, where it is expected that the mixture of liquid metal and organic liquid will heat up to about llO 1200C, or when a concentrating collector, like concentrating mirrors or a parabolic collector, is used, where it is expected that the mixture will heat up to about 300 400 C, the organic liquid is brought to its boiling temperature and a two phase liquid metal vapour 18, is produced. The thusly formed vapour bubbles expand and accelerate the two phase flow in the conduit 6 through the MHD generator thereby producing electricity.The expansion of the vapour bubbles in the conduit is almost isothermal since the heat capacity of the liquid metal is manyfold higher than that of the vapour. The direct contact heat exchanger and the two phase flow acceleration at constant temperature provides an efficient Rankine type thermodynamic cycle. After leaving the MHD generator, the void fraction is not separated, as it is usually done in other MHD systems, but rather, it is condensed in condenser 10, into droplets or organic liquid forming a mixture 20 of liquid metal and droplets of organic liquid and thus the desired features of retaining throughout the cycle a homogeneous mixture and the recirculation of liquid rather than a gas, is kept. The liquid metal carrying the droplets of the organic liquid and being in direct contact heat exchange therewith is then recycled back to the solar heater to be reheated. This can be achieved by means of the shown MHD pump 14, which pump may use a small part of the electric current produced in the MHD generator. Before entering the heat absorber 4, the flow 20 is advantageously passed through the mixer or disperser 16 where the droplets of the organic liquid are atomized and dispersed more homogeneously in the liquid metal. A modification of the apparatus of Figure 1 is illustrated in Figure 2 wherein the same reference numbers are used to identify components having the same function and operation. As can be seen, the apparatus is substantially identical to the previously described one, except for the condenser which, in the present embodiment, is a heat exchange condenser 22 having an inlet pipe 24 and an outlet pipe 26, respectively supplying to the heat exchanger cold fluid, e.g., water, and extracting therefrom fluid heated by means of the heat energy which is given off by the condensation of the vapour bubbles into liquid droplets. The heated fluid can be used for any suitable purpose. The total efficiency of this system, simultaneously producing electricity and heat, is about 50 even when plane or flat collectors are used. Turning now to Figure 3, there is illustrated still a further embodiment of the present invention. Here again identical reference numbers are used to identify similar components. According to this embodiment, there is interposed, between the absorber 4 and the conduits 6 and 12, a heat exchanger 28 so that the mixture of liquid metal and organic liquid is heated by the solar energy via the heat exchanger 28 and the heat absorbed in the absorber 4 is transferred to the heat exchanger by means of a liquid 30 circulating between the absorber and the heat exchanger in a closed loop, whereby said recycled liquid metal and organic liquid droplets are indirectly reheated by the energy collected by said solar energy absorber rather than directly as in the previously illustrated embodiments. Advantageously, the heat carrying liquid from the absorber to heat exchanger may be constituted by a liquid metal, thus forming a highly effective liquid metal liquid metal heat exchanger. Due to the high thermal conductivity and low vapour pressure of liquid metals, it is possible to increase the temperatures commonly achieved in solar absorbers and, consequently, to obtain a more efficient electricity and hot liquid producing system. Also, the optional use of permanent magnets in theMHD generator and or in the MHD pump is of advantage since there is no need for energy for the excitation of the necessary magnetic fields. The MHD thermal electric power apparatus particularly described operates with relatively low temperatures, in contrast to the previously proposed systems discussed earlier.
