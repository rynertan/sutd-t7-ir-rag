## Description
X ray contrast agents This invention relates to novel non ionic iodinatedX ray contrast agents for myelographic and vascular use. In our British Patent Specification No. 1,321,591 we describe and claim certain non ionic compounds as X ray contrast agents, such compounds representing an important advance over previously known ionicX ray contrast agents in respect of side effects due to high concentrations of ions and or to high osmolality. Such compounds are suitable for one or more possible fields of X ray visualisation but are not usually suitable for a wide range or spectrum of such uses. In general, non ionic X ray contrast agents may be of use in two main fields, namely Intravascular visualisation, including urography and angiography, for example cerebral, coronary and peripheral angiography, and Myelography, i.e. injection into the cerebrospinal fluid. Radiologists have used different X ray contrast agents particularly adapted to different fields of use but there are clearly advantages if it is possible to use a single X ray contrast agent for a wide range of uses apart from economies of scale in manufacture, it is also more satisfactory for the radiologist to be able to use experience of a contrast agent gained in one field of use, e.g. urography, in some other field, e.g. angiography or myelography. For the purposes of this specification an X ray contrast agent which can be used in all forms of intravascular visualisation and myelography is termed a generalX ray contrast agent . In our British Patent No. 1,548,594 we describe and claim two specific compounds which may be used as general X ray contrast agents and which fulfil a package of favourable parameters namely low toxicity, low osmolality, high stability, ease of manufacture and the ability to produce solutions of high concentration but low osmolality. Low viscosity at high concentrations is also desirable. As stated in British Patent No. 1,548,594 whilst the minimum standard for each parameter is not necessarily exceptionally high in itself, it is very unusual to find a compound which possesses the whole package of favourable properties at a suitably high level. It is known that X ray contrast agents which possess close structural similarities may nevertheless possess very different properties such as for example toxicity. Thus it is a difficult empirical task to identify a compound which possesses a complete package of favourable parameters and which can be used as a general X ray contrast agent. The present invention is based on the discovery of two isomeric N,N bis dihydroxypropyl 5 N 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl acetamidol 2,4,6 triiodoisoph thalamides of the formula EMI2.1 where R represents CH CH2OH 2 or CH2CH OH CH2OH which fulfil the above mentioned parameters of low toxicity, low osmolality, high stability and ease of manufacture as set out in British PatentNo. 1,548,594, whilst in addition possessing high solubility and more particularly a zero or very low crystal growth rate. These factors ensure that the compounds of the invention can be used as generalX ray contrast agents whilst ensuring the high stability of even their supersaturated solutions.The zero or very low crystal growth rate of the compounds of formula I enables highly concentrated solutions of the compounds to be stored for long periods without the risk of crystalline material separating out of solution. It is clearly advantageous to formulateX ray contrast agents in sterile solutions rather than for the radiologist to have to prepare a sterile solution immediately prior to use from the X ray contrast agent in freeze dried form. Such solutions prepared by the radiologist cannot be stored for any length of time and as a result X ray contrast agent is wasted through the need to dispose of unused solution. On the other hand where X ray contrast agents are formulated as sterile solutions it is advantageous for the agent to have as low a crystal growth rate as possible in order to mitigate the risk of crystalline material separating out of solution. Thus according to the present invention we provide the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined including the stereoisomeric forms thereof separately or in combination. These compounds are not specifically dis closed in our British PatentSpecification No. 1,321,591, and represent a substantial and valuable advance over the compounds generally disclosed in our above British Patent Specification. The compound of formula I in which R is CH CH2OH 2, namely N,N bis l,3 dihydroxy 2 propyl 5 N 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl acetamido 2,4,6 triiodoisophthalamide compound A , exists in the form of both exo and endo isomers and both such isomers are included within the scope of the present invention. Moreover the compound contains a chiral carbon atom and thus exists in optically active forms. The present invention thus includes the d , 1 and racemic forms of the compound of formula I in which R is CH CH2OH 2. The compound of formula 1 in which R is CH2CH OH CH2OH namely N,N bis 2,3 dihydroxypropyl 5 N 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl acetamido 2,4,6 tri iodoisophthal amide Compound B also exists in the form of endo and exo isomers, but in addition to the chiral centre in the 3 methoxy 2 hydroxypropyl chain, also possesses chiral centres in the two groupsR. Since rotation about the bond between the nitrogen atom and the benzene nucleus is, in addition, strongly restricted, there are eight enantiomers forming four racemates and the invention extends to all the above isomeric forms. Compound A has been found to possess an intravenous toxicity LD50i.v in the mouse of 18,000 mg I kg while that of Compound B is 22,000 the maximum intravenous toxicity limit proposed in British Patent No. 1,548,594 as suitable for a general X ray contrast agent is 17,000 mg I kg. The intracerebral toxicity LD50 i.c. in the mouse of Compound A is 1850 mg I kg, while that of Compound B is greater than 1750 mg I kg the maximum intracerebral toxicity limit proposed in BritishPatent No. 1,548,594 as suitable for a general Xray contrast agent being 1500 mg I kg. The nephrotoxicity in the rabbit of both CompoundA and Compound B is greater than 10,500 mg I kg this being the nephrotoxicity limit proposed in BritishPatent No. 1,548,594 as suitable for a general Xray contrast agent Compound A possesses low osmolality 0.75 at 300 mg I ml, this being the maximum osmolality limit proposed in British Patent No. 1, 548,594 as suitable for a general X ray contrast agent, whilstCompound B possesses an osmolality of 0.66 at 300 mg I ml.Compound A possesses a viscosity of 6.1 cP at 370 and 12.7 at 200C, the concentration being 300 mgI ml in each case. The maximum viscosity proposed in British Patent No. 1,548,594 for suitability as a general X ray contrast agent is 6.5 cP at 370C concentration 300 mg I ml . Compound A possesses a relatively high solubility in water, namely 31 g 100 ml 141 mg I ml at 200C and 38 g lOOml 173 mg I ml at 370C. At relatively high concentrations the majority of known non ionicX ray contrast agents probably exist as supersaturated solutions rather than as true aqueous solutions.The above solubility characteristics enable the compounds of the invention to be used at concentrations of about 40 g 100ml without supersaturation at body temperature. Compound B forms highly concentrated solutions, for example, lOOg 100m1 without any tendency to crystallise.This may well be due to the number of isomeric species present. It will be appreciated that a supersaturated solution is thermodynamically unstable and is liable to crystallise unexpectedly, particularly if contacted with seed crystals. Such crystallisation could lead to the injection of significant quantities of crystalline material so causing tissue damage. Such damage would depend in part on the size of the crystals which were inadvertently injected and clearly microfine crystals would not give rise to this problem suspensions of microfine crystals are, in fact, frequently formulated for injection. We have found that supersaturated solutions of Compound A crystallise, even when seeded, extremely slowly. One advantage of this is that the tendency to crystallise from supersaturated solution is greatly reduced, so that such solutions can be stored for long periods. Naturally, using modern pharmaceutical techniques it is possible to minimise any possibility of seed crystals being present. However, even if crystallisation does begin, the very slow rate of crystallisation as well as the relatively high solubility at body temperature mean that the crystals remain very small in the vials and dissolve rapidly in the body fluid if injected. The compounds of the present invention are thus of particular interest as general X ray contrast agents in that their supersaturated solutions may be stored for long periods without risk of formation of crystals which could cause tissue damage on injection.The very low crystal growth rate of Compound A makes the true solubility of the compound less critical.These properties of the compounds of formula I in particular render them an important and valuable advance over many X ray contrast agents generally disclosed in the literature including our above mentionedPatent Specifications. With regard to stability, the compounds of formula I have been found to be stable to autoclaving at 12O0C for 20 minutes. In this connection it should be noted that the compounds of formula I contain a m carboxamido o iodo N B hydroxyalkyl aniline moiety which tends to lead to intramolecular cyclisation with displacement of iodine, as described in ourBritish Patent Application 7923277A. For this reason the compounds of formula I are preferably autoclaved for sterilisation in the presence of a physiologically acceptable buffer system the pH of which decreases with increasing temperature, for example ammonia or an amine having a pKa at 150C of less than or equal to 9.5, as described in our above British PatentApplication.We have found that autoclaving of a 300 mg I ml solution of Compound A containing lOmMTRIS and 0.32 mg per gram of CaNa2 EDTA at 1200C for 20 minutes resulted in a pH drop of only 0.06 pH units from pH 7.35 to 7.29 and an increase in inorganic iodide of from ll g ml to only 17yxg ml. No change was observed by TLC and HPLC. The compounds of the present invention thus both possess the above mentioned package of favourable parameters including ease of manufacture see below and are therefore of particular interest as generalX ray contrast agents. The present invention also provides radiological compositions comprising as active ingredient at least one of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined in association with an inert carrier. The radiological compositions of the present invention are conveniently presented in a form suitable for administration by injection, for example, in ampoules or vials. The capacity of the ampoule or vial may be, for example, from 5 to 500 ml and the concentration may, for example, be from 20 to 500 mg I ml. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in any convenient manner, but the following process is of particular interest and constitutes a further feature of the present invention. Thus there is provided a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which comprises reacting the compound of formula EMI7.1 where R has the above meanings or a derivative thereof having one or more protecting groups such as acyl groups, e.g. acetyl, or cyclic acetals or ketals, with one or more reagents effective to introduce the 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl group for example, a compound of the formula CH30CH2CHOHCH2X III wherein X represents an atom or group removable as an anion or a derivative thereof having a protecting group e.g. an acyl group, followed, where necessary, by hydrolysis of any unwanted protecting groups whereby a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined is obtained. Where a compound of formula III is used, this is preferably a reactive ester derivative such as a compound of formula III in which X represents a halogen atom e.g. a chlorine or bromine atom, or a sulphate or hydrocarbon sulphate group e.g. a tosyl or mesyl group. The reactive derivative is preferably reacted with the acetamido starting material under basic conditions, for example in a non aqueous medium, e.g. in an alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, 2 methoxyethanol, and or propylene glycol. Propylene glycol may for example be used in admixture with methanol and or ethanol. A base, conveniently an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide, or an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide is preferably used. It is also possible to react the acetamido compound with an epoxide, i.e. methoxymethyloxirane. Thus, for example, a compound of formula I may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formulaII with 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl chloride preferably in the presence of propylene glycol and or methanol with, for example, sodium hydroxide as base. The compounds of formula II may be prepared in any convenient manner, for example, by reaction of 5 acetamido 2,4,6 triiodoisophthaloyl chloride and or 5 diacetylamino 2, 4,6 tr iiodoisophthaloyl chloride with 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propylamine or 2,3dihydroxypropylamine followed, where the 5 diacetyl amino compound is used by removal of one N acetyl group, e.g. by alkaline hydrolysis at slightly elevated temperature. The reaction may, for example, be effected in the presence of dimethylformamide or dioxan as solvent, conveniently in the additional presence of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as potassium bicarbonate. A compound of formula II may also be prepared for example, by acetylation of a compound of the formula EMI9.1 where R has the above meanings Acetylation may be effected by any convenient method e.g. by the use of acetic anhydride which can also serve as the solvent together with catalytic amounts of a mineral acid e.g. sulphuric or perchloric acid, or by the use of an acid halide preferably in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide.Where unwanted O acetyl groupings are formed or other protecting groups are present these may be removed either at this stage or after the hydroxyalkylation of the O acetylated or protected compound. The basic hydrolysis of the O acetyl grouping may for example, be effected using aqueous alkali metal hydroxide e.g. sodium hydroxide, the reaction preferably being carried out at slightly elevated temperature, e.g.about 500C In addition, depending on the acetylating agent used, other products may be formed and require separation.When acetic anhydride is used with concentrated sulphuric acid as catalyst, the primary amino group is often, in part, bis acetylated, such that an overacetylated product is obtained. In general a mixture of acetylated products will be obtained. If desired, the bis acetylamino group may be hydrolysed to the monoacetylamino group under mild basic conditions e.g. by the use of sodium hydroxide in, for example, methanol prior to N hydroxyalkylation. It is, however, possible to effect N hydroxyalkylation using the bis acetylamino compound with simultaneous solvolysis. The compounds of the present invention are subject to endo exo isomerism as is explained below.Referring to the following formula EMI10.1 where R has the above meanings it will be appreciated that exo and endo isomers exist due to restricted rotation of the N CO bond 1 caused by steric hindrance from the adjacent bulky iodine atoms and the presence of the 2 hydroxy3 methoxypropyl group bonded to the said N atom.These isomers tend to equilibrate in solution but are sufficiently stable to be separated by thin layer chromatography. The compounds of the present invention also exist in racemic and optically active forms, as explained above. It will be apreciated that the individual optically active isomers of the compound of the invention can readily be stained by conventional methods. Thus, for example, the individual optically active isomers of Compound A may be obtained by using an optically active 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropylating agent to introduce the 2 hydroxy 3 methoxypropyl group. Separate optical isomers of the compounds of formula I can, if required, be mixed in equal proportions to produce a racemate.Similarly, Compound B can be prepared also using optically active side chain intermediates. The compounds of formula II as hereinbefore defined are important intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula I and constitutes a further feature of the present invention. The preparation of the compounds of formulaI and II are illustrated in the following in which temperatures are quoted in OC. Radiological compositions containing the compounds of formula I of the present invention as active ingredient are also exemplified hereinafter Preparation 5 Acetamido N,N bis l,3 dihydroxy 2 propyl 2,4,6 triiodoisophthalamide 5 Amino N,N bis 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propyl 2,4,6 triiodoisophthalamide 300 g was suspended in acetic anhydride 1.5 1 at 90 in an oil bath and then p toluenesulphonic acid 3g was added.
