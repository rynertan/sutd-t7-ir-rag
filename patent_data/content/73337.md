# Elastic yarn supply package.

## Abstract
An improved elastic yarn supply package is provided in the form of a double face, warp knit tape from which the elastic yarns can be unravelled for feeding to subsequent fabric making operations. The improved package, which is readily spittable into narrower tapes, has repeating stitch patterns whose underlaps do not cross each other or run in opposite directions between wales.
