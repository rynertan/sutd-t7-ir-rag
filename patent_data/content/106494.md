# ELECTRONICALLY SCANNED ANTENNA

## Abstract
There are provided N independent radiation opening unit adapted to form N radiation beams in a first radiation plane N 1 and a plurality of beam control means having a power variable distribution performance and a phase control performance. The control means performs radiation beam controls including switching of the radiation beam, setting of radiation power ratio for the respective radiation beams to any desired values in the first radiation plane regarding the N radiation beams, and radiation beam scanning in a second radiation plane orthogonal to the first radiation plane in a predetermined reference direction with reference to the first radiation plane. This antenna can reduce the number of the phase shifters and eliminate a high power phase shifter.
