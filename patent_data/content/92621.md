## Description
A METHOD FOR SURFACE WELDING OF AUSTENITIC STAINLESS STEEL The present invention relates to a method for surfacing welding of stainless steel and particularly to improvement of lining formed by surfacing welding of austenitic stainless steel over an inner surface of a tower or a tank and the like made of carbon steel or a low alloy steel, particularly a reaction vessel wherein hydrogen at a high temperature under a high pressure is handled and more particularly to improvement of prevention of disbonding in these lined vessels during using. An inner surface of reaction vessels used for an apparatus for refining petroleum or an apparatus for liquifying coal is in most case surfacing welded with austenitic stainless steel. These vessels are operated in hydrogen environment at high temperature under high pressure, so that a deposited metal or a base metal occludes hydrogen and in shutdown, a large amount of hydrogen accumulates at boundary of base metal and deposited metal and separating cracks so called disbonding are caused at austenite grain boundary and a great problem occurs. As counter measure for preventing this disbonding, some inventions and proposals have been made but any means lowers the operation efficiency and is not reliable one. Japanese Patent Laid Open Applications 107,453 79, 71,746 79 and 14,171 80 disclose that a base metal is underlaid with a metal having a substantially same composition as the base metal or ferritic stainless steel and then surfaced with austenitic stainless steel having a given composition, and in these means, one foreign underlaying layer must be superfluously welded. JapanesePatent Laid Open Application 117,561 80 proposes that martensite is included as an average composition of the deposited metal but martensite itself is apt to be hardened and embrittled and even if the disbonding resistance is improved, there is a defect that the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement of the weld metal itself is rather increased.It is possible to improve the disbonding resistance by effecting the welding under the optimum conditions but as far as the submerged arc welding abbreviated as SAW hereinafter or the electro slag welding abbreviated as ESW hereinafter , wherein a band electrode having excellent operating efficiency is used, is effected, it is impossible to completely prevent the formati6n of coarse and large austenite grains at the boundary portion, which causes the disbonding. The present invention has intended the improvement of the disbonding resistance irrelative to the presence of the coarse and large austenite grains by strengthening the austenite grain boundary itself where the disbonding is caused, by balancing the components Si and B in the steel components forming the surfacing layer. The means for improving the disbonding resistance according to the present invention is effective irrelative to the welding process and the welding conditions and the corrosion resistance and the hydrogen embrittlement resistance are completely the same as those of the prior arts. For a better understanding of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. la and Fig. lb are plan views showing the shape of specimens for the disbonding test and the side bend test wherein two layers are welded Fig. 2 is a graph showing the proper range of Si and B in the deposited metals Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b are plan views showing the shape of specimens for the disbonding test and the side bend test, wherein one layer is welded, and Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing appearance of a specimen for the immersing test in a practically used device. The inventors have found that B and Si have close relation to the strength of austenite grain boundary as shown hereinafter and noticed thereto and made investigation and clarified the composition range of the deposited metal of the surfacing welding of stainless steel, which is excellent in the disbonding resistance.

SEP 0.80 SEP II SEP tb The size of these band electrodes was a thickness of 0.4 mm and a width of 150 mm and this welding using the above described fluxes was ESW surfacing which does not form arc. B transferred from B2O3 compounded in the test flux is an element which promotes hot cracking and therefore a dye permeating flow detect JIS Z 2343 was effected after welding the above described first layer to confirm no abnormality, and then the welding of the second layer was effected. After finishing the welding, a post heat treatment at 690 C for 24 hours was carried out and an autoclave specimen and a side bend specimen as shown. in Fig. 1 a and b were made. The disbonding test was effected as follows. The specimen was placed in a autoclave at 4500C for 48 hours by varying hydrogen pressure to 150, 175 and 200 atm. and hydrogen was occluded. 72 hours after cooling in air, the disbonding was determined. The disbonding was detected by means of an ultrasonic flaw detector and an indication corresponding to an artificial flow of 2.0 mmf was referred to as 50 and the case of indication of more than 50 was judged as disbonding . The test results are shown in Fig. 2 and the electrode No. and the flux No.corresponding to the amounts of Si and B in the deposited metals are shown therein. The side bend test was carried out following to JIS Z 3122 and the formation of cracks was determined. In the weldings using the test flux F 6, hot cracking was caused in any electrodes and in the weldings using the electrode D 5, cracks were formed in the deposited metals in the side bend test using any fluxes mark num in Fig. 2 , so that the disbonding test was carried out with respect to the specimens wherein these specimens are excluded. In the flux F 1 no addition of B2Os , when an amount of Si in the deposited metal is less than 0.2 , the disbontl g does not occur upto the test pressure of 150 atom. but as the amount of B203 added increases, the limit of the amount of Si increases and when the amount ofB in the deposited metal becomes 0.065 , even if the amount of Si in the deposited metal is 0.72 , the disbonding is not caused under a severe test condition, such as 4500C and 200 atm. In a usual reaction vessel, for example a direct desulfurizing apparatus, if the conditions of 4500C and 150 atm. are assumed, the assumable most severe conditions are fully satisfied, so that it has been confirmed that it is necessary to satisfy the requirement of B 0.08 , Si 0.75 and log B 2 2.4 X Si 4.1 as the range where the disqualification in the hot cracking and side bend tests does not occur and the disbonding is not caused. In the present invention, the disbonding resistance is improved due to strengthening of austenite grain boundary, so that the present invention can be applied in principle to austenitic deposited metals having any compositions but the composition is limited from the necessary requirements in practical use, such as corrosion resistance, mechanical properties and the like. That is, C is preferred to be lower in order to maintain the corrosion resistance but an amount up to 0.08 is admissible considering transfer from a base metal and cost of an electrode. Mn is effective for preventing the hot cracking and an amount of not less than 0.5 is necessary but even if an amount of more than 3 is contained, the effect is low, so that the amount is preferred to be 0.5 3 . Ni and Cr need amounts of not less than 7 and not less than 16 respectively in order to maintain the corrosion resistance but when the amounts of Ni and Cr exceed 16 and 25 respectively, the cost becomes too high, because the application is a reaction vessel and such amounts are meaningless. Either or both of Nb and Mo are effective for improving the corrosion resistance of the grain boundary after post heat treatment but when an excessive amount is added, a phase is formed and the side bend ductility and the hydrogen embrittlement are impaired, so that Nb and Mo should be not greater than 1 and not greater than 3 respectively. The following examples are given for the purpose of illustration of the invention and are not intended as limitation thereof.Example 1 3 Horizontal ESW surfacing welding. The above mentioned ASME SA 387 Gr 22 steel sheet 1 was subjected to surfacing welding by using a band electrode having a thickness of 0.4 mm and a width of 150 mm at a current of 2500 A, a voltage of 28 V and a welding speed of 10 20 cm min shown in the followingTable 2 to form one layer 2 and then subjected to SR treatment at 6900C for 48 hours. By using specimens as shown in Fig. 3, a and b, hydrogen was occluded in an autoclave at 4500C under 150 atm. for 480 hours and then the thus treated specimens were cooled in air.The composition of the electrode was 0.01 of C, 0.12 of Si, 2.0 of Mn, 0.015 of P, 0.006 of S, 9.96 of Ni, 20.33 of Cr, 0.8 of Nb and 0.003 of B and the flux was the above described F 1. The composition and test results of the obtained deposited metals are shown in Table 2 and it has been confirmed that the disbonding is not caused in a broad welding speed range, that is a broad variation range of heat input.

The disbonding did not occur in both surfaces of the surfaced portions and it has been confirmed that the present invention does not cause disbonding in the practically used device. In the practice of the present invention, as seen from Examples, it is desirable in order to improve the yield of B and reduce Si content in the deposited metal that the basicity CaO MgO SiO2 of the flux is made to be more than 1 and that the addition of CaF2 for improving the slag removing ability is more than 10 . When B is added through reduction of boron oxide in the flux, the added amount is less than 9.5 h, calculated as B203, as shown in the flux F S in order to prevent the hot cracking. When B is added in a form of metal or alloy from a flux or electrode, the yield of B is about 1 6 in the former and about 1 4 in the latter, so that the added amount should be limited to less than 0.6 and 0.4 calculated as B, respectively. Even if the addition of B is effected by using the above described processes alone or in combination, when the range is within the admissible range in Fig. 2, there is no problem. Discussion was made with respect to austenitic stainless steel in Examples but of course, the present invention is applicable to inconel, which is completely austenite. As mentioned above, the present invention can be applied to the surfacing welding using a band electrode, which is suitable for lining of an inner surface of towers and tanks made of carbon steel or low alloy steel, particularly vessels used for reaction under hydrogen environment at high temperature and high pressure, and the disbonding which is apt to be caused during use of the lining, can be effectively prevented without deteriorating the crack susceptibility which is estimated in hot cracking or side bend test, so that the reliability of the above described lining processing is noticeably improved.
