# String load apportioned racket.

## Abstract
A racket has a hand grip 13 joined to a frame having a shank region 11 and flaring outwards in a throat region 12 and extending around a generally oval ball hitting region stand by transverse strings 17 and longitudinal strings 15 . A central plurality of the strings 15 have a strung length at least 30 longer than all other strings in the network and that this central plurality includes at least one third ₁ ₃ of all the longitudinal strings in the network. The longer longitudinal strings are strung with at least 30 more tension than all other strings in the network so that the longer strung length and the greater tension causes the longer longitudinal strings to provide a greater share in the transverse strangs of the string force that decelerates a ball penetrating the string network in the central region occupied by the longer longitudinal strings.
