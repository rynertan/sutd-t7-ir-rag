# Temperature dependent voltage generator circuitry.

## Abstract
A temperature compensating voltage generator circuit for compensating the temperature characteristics of an electric device whose electrical characteristics vary in accordance with the change of the ambient temperature and can be changed or controlled by a control voltage comprises temperature sensing means 1 for generating an electric signal whose voltage level varies in accordance with a temperature change discriminating means 2 for discrimi nating the electric signal by using a predetermined reference voltage and for generating intermediate signals e₁, e₂ in accordance with the voltage level of the electric signal and combining means 3 for combining the intermediate signals in accordance with a selected voltage ratio, thereby to provide an output signal e₄ for use as a temperature compensating voltage. Such a generator can allow indepen dent compensation of temperature characteristics at high and low temperatures.
