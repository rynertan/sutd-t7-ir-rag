# Gas detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas detecting apparatus is disclosed in which detec tion outputs from a plurality of semiconductor gas detecting elements 2011, 2012, 2013 different in gas detection characteristic from each other and previously obtained char acteristic values of the semiconductor gas detecting ele ments for a mixed gas are subjected to operational proces sing to detect one or more specified constituent gases contained in the mixed gas, and in which when the specified constituent gas is detected, the detection information is announced by some means 2081, 2082 , and also the supply of gas is stopped 207 or a supply gas is diluted.
