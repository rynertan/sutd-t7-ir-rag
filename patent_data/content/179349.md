# Solvent pressurization.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a solvent pressuriza tion system for use in liquid chromatography which includes a source of pressurized gas, a plurality of sealed vessels that are adapted to hold solvents therein, each of the vessels having a gas input port, said vessels being located within a closeable compartment a double manifold having a distri bution chamber in communication with the pressurized gas from the gas source and an exhaust chamber communicat able with a venting, system, a set of fittings for each vessel for controlling the gas flow from the distribution chamber to the vessel and from the vessel to the exhaust chamber, each set of fittings including inlet valve means and outlet valve means and an element for opening or closing both valve means together. The pressurization system further includes a system for releaving the pressure from the vessels when the compartment door is open, and a system for releaving the pressure from the vessels when the pressure in the vessels exceeds a predetermined pressure.
