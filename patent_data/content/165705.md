# Integrated circuit chip carrier.

## Abstract
A chip carrier includes a body 1 having a central region and sidewalls 31 connected to the central region by an elastically deformable region 33 , in order to reduce thermal strains. Also for the same reason a heat sink 41 may be attached underneath the carrier below the carrier s die attachment site 8 and thermally conductive material 40,42 may connect them together. The heat sink may be used for mechanical anchorage. The chip carrier may be produced by injection moulding from an aromatic thermoplastic polymer, A carrier may be moulded with more than one die attachment site or a circuit board with die attachment sites could be moulded, preferably with the die attachment site recessed so that the surface of the die 9 is co planar with conductive tracks on the board.
