## Description
Gas tank, particularly an LPG tank for a vehicle. The invention relates to a gas tank, particularly anLPG tank for a vehicle, comprising a tank body and a connecting plate for appendages. The connecting plate of the known gas tank is rectangular. The invention has for its object to simplify the manufacture of a gas tank. To this end the connecting plate is circular. It is considerably easier to make a circular hole in the wall of a gas tank than a rectangular one. It is particularly much easier to weld a round body by automation in a wall. Moreover, by turning the connecting plate with respect to the wall any desired relative position can be obtained, so that the connections can be established at a place which is ideal for any vehicle, whilst the tank bodies and the connecting plates are universal. The aforesaid and further features of the invention will be more fully described hereinafter with reference to a drawing. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a side elevation and partially a sectional view of a gas tank in accordance with the invention, Fig. 2 a plan view of the tank of Fig. 1, the gas cap being omitted, Fig. 30n an emerged scale a side elevation partly broken away of detail III of Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 a plan view partly broken away of Fig. 3. The gas tank 1 according to the invention intended for containing liquid petroleum gas for a car comprises a tank body 2, having such a shape that it can be disposed at the place of a spare wheel. The gas tank 1 has the shape of a round disc bilaterally curved in an axial outward direction and may have an outer diameter a of 60 cm and a maximum height b of 27 Cm. The tank body 2 comprises two dishes 3 and 4, the rim 5 of one dish 3 gripping around the rim 6 of the other dish 4, whilstta welding seam 7 is made on the outer side of the other rim 6 to the rim 5. The dishes 3 and 4 have a wall thickness c of, for example, 5 to 6 mm and owing to their spherical shape they are highly resistant to deformation. The other rim 6 has an inner diameter d which is smaller than the inner diameter e of the adjacent part 8 of the dish 4.In a circular recess of the dish 4 a circular connecting plate 26 is welded, having a thickness f of for example 2 cm by means of bilateral welding seams 9.The circular connecting plate 26 has the required recesses for the accessories i.e. a closing hole 10 with blind screwthreaded holes 11 for a gauging meter 18, a tapped hole 12 for a level shutter 17, a level scanning pipe 13 being welded in said tapped hole 12 and leading into the tank body 2 to the filling level 15 of 80 capacity, a tapped hole 16 for a filling valve 19, a tapped hole 20 for a tank shutter 21 and a tapped hole 22 for a safety valve 23. Furthermore two blind screwthreaded holes 24 are provided for connecting a gas cap 27 with the connecting plate 26 with the interposition of an elastic stuffing ring 25 said cap being essentially circular, that is to say having the shape of a truncated cylinder, said cap being sealed on top with the interposition of an elastic stuffing ring 29 with the aid of a substantially round, particularly slightly oval cover 28, which is releasably fastened to the gas cap 27 by means of a bracket 30, which is pivotable about pins 31 and connected with the cover 28 and which grips by two hooks 53 below stationary protruding pins 32 of the gas cap 27. Thus the cover 28 can be readily removed and replaced on the gas cap 27. The filling conduit 37 passes through a branch 38 of an elastic sleeve 34 across the connecting nipple 35 of the gas cap 27 to the interior and joins the filling valve 19.The outlet conduit 39 is passed from the tank shutter 21 through a nipple 40 of the gas cap 27 and a sleeve 42 clamped tight by means of a hose clamp 41, From the level shutter 17 a conduit 36 passes via a nipple 35 of the gas cap 27 and a branch 33 of the sleeve 34 to a checking closing member not shown . The sleeve 34 is clamped to the nipple 35 by means of a hose clamp 44. The space 47 inside the gas cap 27 communicates with the open air through an elastic elbow 49 screwed tightly in the gas cap 27 and a conduit 50 clamped therein and leading out of the vehicle. To the dish 4 four profiled pieces 51 distributed along the periphery are provided. These pieces have a T shaped profile and have connecting means, particularly connecting holes 52 for readily fastening the gas tank by means of brackets not shown to a vehicle. The round connecting plate is particularly important for a concave, disc shaped tank body, but it might as well be used for a different, for example, a cylindrical shape of the tank body.
