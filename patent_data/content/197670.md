# Improvements in or relating to tube couplings.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a tube coupling having a hollow tubular body 10 with collet form couplings 32, 33 at either end thereof to receive and lock tubes in the body at either end. The body has an internal annular wall 14 and an inner liner 25 which extends over the wall and along the body to either side of the annular wall towards the locations of the collets 32, 33 . The liner 25 is formed from a material which is inert to the fluid to be passed through the tubes and has integral annular seals to seal with the tubes inserted in the body to prevent loss of fluid from the tubes into parts of the body not covered by the liner.
