## Description
CARBONYLATION PROCESS EMPLOYING A CATALYST STABILISED IN SOLUBLE FORM The present invention relates to a carbonylation process improvement. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved process scheme wherein at least a portion of the reaction mass from a carbonylation process can be withdrawn from the reactor and separated at a lower pressure from a catalyst containing stream which is recycled to the reactor. In this processing scheme the catalyst is stabilized in soluble form and any of the catalyst which may have precipitated is reconverted to a soluble form. Recently, processes for producing carboxylic acids and esters by carbonylating olefins, alcohols, esters, halides and ethers in the presence of homogeneous catalyst systems that contain rhodium and halogen components such as iodine components and bromine components have been disclosed and placed into commercial operations. These recently developed processes represent a distinct improvement over the classic carbonylation processes wherein such feed materials have been previously carbonylated in the presence of such catalst systems as phosphoric acid, phosphates, activated carbon, heavy metal salts and metal carbonyls such as cobalt carbonyl, iron carbonyl and nickel carbonyl. All of these previously known processes require the use of extremely high partial pressures of carbon monoxide.These previously known carbonylation systems also have distinct disadvantages in that they require higher catalyst concentrations, longer reaction times, higher temperatures to obtain substantial reaction and conversion rates that all result in larger and more costly processing equipment and higher manufacturing costs. The discovery that rhodium and iodine or bromine containing catalyst systems will carbonylate such feed materials as olefins, alcohols and esters, halide or ether derivatives of the alcohols at relatively mild pressure and temperature conditions was a distinct contribution to the carbonylation art. In spite of the vast superiority of these newly developed catalyst systems, it has been found that conventional processing schemes for separation of the carbonylation products from the liquid reaction mass has posted problems of catalyst inactivation and precipitation from carbon monoxide deficient streams. It has been disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,845,121 that by withdrawing a portion of the liquid reaction mass from the reactor and passing it to a separation zone of substantially lower pressure, without the addition of heat, at least a portion of the carbonylation products can be vaporized and passed on to purification equipment with much reduced decomposition of the carbonylation catalyst system. According to this scheme, the carbonylation reaction is carried out in the reaction zone at a temperature of from about 500 to about 5000C and a pressure of from about 345 to about 10340 kPa.By withdrawing a portion of the liquid reaction mass and passing it to a separation zone that is maintained at a pressure that is substantially lower than the pressure in the reactor, at least a portion of the carbonylation products will vapor ize with much reduced decomposition of the liquid catalyst system. This vaporization will take place without the addition of heat to the reaction mass. The unvapor ized liquid in the separation zone containing the catalyst system can be recycled to the reactor. Using this processing scheme, it has been found that catalyst precipitation may occur, though to Ã…a reduced degree, from liquid streams which are deficient in carbon monoxide. Such streams include the stream of reaction mass withdrawn from the reaction zone, in whichCO has been consumed by reaction, and the liquid cycle stream returned from the separation zone to the reaction zone. From U.S. Patent 3,818,060 it is known that pentavalent nitrogen and phosphorous compounds of the form XNR3 or XPR3 wherein X is oxygen or sulfur may be used as stabilizers for rhodium catalysts in the liquid phase carbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds.Also, from U.S. Patent 3,579,552 it is known that, inter alia, phosphines, amines and trihalostannate compounds form coordination complexes with rhodium and carbon monoxide which remain soluble in the carbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to prevent precipitation of the soluble catalyst system from CO deficient streams. Another object of this invention is to reconvert precipitated components of the catalyst system to soluble form. Additional objects of this invention will become apparent from the following discussion of the invention. SUStXRY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an improvement in a carbonylation process wherein an olefin, an alcohol, or an ester, halide or ether derivative of said alcohol is reacted with carbon monoxide in a liquid phase in the presence of a catalyst system that contains a a rhodium component, and b an iodine or bromine component, and in which at least a portion of the carbonylation products are separated from the liquid reaction mass at a reduced CO partial pressure in a separation zone. From this separation zone, an unvaporized liquid stream which is enriched in the catalyst system components is withdrawn and recycled to the reaction zone for reuse in the carbonylation process. A recycle pump is employed to increase the pressure of this liquid stream to enable its transfer back into the higher pressure reaction zone. Under the conditions of reduced CO partial pressure existing in the separation zone and piping connecting the separation zone to the reaction zone, a small portion of the catalyst system may decompose, forming an insol uble rhodium containing precipitate. According to the present invention, a stabilizer component selected from 1 N,N,N , N tetramethyl o phenylenediamine and 2, 3 dipyridyl, 2 a substituted diphosphine having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are alkyl or aryl substituted alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or in which R1,R2, K4 and K5 are aryl or alkyl substituted acryl radii cals having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and R3 is a polymethylene group having 1 3 carbon atoms 3 a dibasic or polybasic carboxylic acid having the formula EMI4.2 WhereinYl is of the formula CX1X2 m in which m is 2 to 10 and wherein Y2, Y3j Y4 and Y5 are of the formula CX1X2 n in which n is 1 to 10, and X1 and X2 are independently selected from hydrogen, a halogen, lower alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, hydroxy substituted alkyl and carboxy substituted alkyl, or 4 a compound. of germanium, antimony, tin, or an alkali metal is employed as a catalyst stabilizer for rhodium.catalysts in the carbonylation of methanol. Preferably, the stabilizer component is employed in a molar ratio of at least about 0.5 to the rhodium present. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This invention is directed to the recently developed carbonylation processes wherein olefins, alcohols and ester, halide and ether derivatives of the alcohols are reacted with carbon monoxide in a liquid phase system in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system that contains a a rhodium, and b an iodine or baniiiecomponent. This invention reducestthe catalyst precipitation problems which may be encountered in the process of separation of the carbonylation products from the liquid mass which invol ves withdrawing at least a portion of the liquid reaction mass from the reactor and passing it to a separation zone that is maintained at a substantially lower pressure. The lower pressure in the separation zone results in the vaporization at at least a portion of the carbonylation products which are then withdrawn from the separation zone in the vapor form. The unvaporized liquid in the separation zone containing the stable catalyst system can then be recycled to the reactor for reuse in the carbonylation process. According to this invention, the rhodium carbonyl halide catalyst complex is stabilized by addition of a stabilizer component selected from 1 N,N,N ,N tetramethyl o phenylenediamine and 2,3 dipyridl, 2 a substituted diphosphine having the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are alkyl substituted alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or in which RI R2, R4 and R5 are aryl or alkyl substituted aryl radicals having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and R3 is a polymethylene group having 1 3 carbon atoms 3 a dibasic or polybasic carboxylic acid having the formulaEMI6.2 wherein Y1 is of t. ormula CXlX2 m in which m is 2 to 10 and wherein Y2 Y4 and Y5 are of the formula CX1X2 n in which n 1 to 10, and X1 and X2 are independently selected fi X hydrogen, a halogen, lower alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, hydroxy substituted alkyl and carboxy substituted alkyl or 4 a compound of germanium, antimony, tin, or an alkali metal. The stabilizer component is employed in a molar ratio of at least 0.5 to the rhodium present. When reference is made to the catalyst system throughout this disclosure of this invention, it means a catalyst system that forms on. combining two distinct components in the presence of carbon monoxide. The two essential catalyst precursor materials are a a rhodium7 and b an iodine or bromine component while CO is a third component. Rhodium components suitable for use as constitu ents in the catalyst are described and set out in U. S.Patent 3,845,121, the disclosure of which is incorporated hereby by reference. The iodine or bromine precursor component of the catalyst system used herein may be in combined form with the rhodium as, for instance, one or more ligands in a coordination compound of the rhodium. However, it is generally preferred to have an excess of the iodine or bromine present in the reaction system over the iodine or bromine that exists as ligands of the rhodium compounds.The bromine or iodine precursor can be in the form of elemental bromine or iodine as well as combinations of bromine or iodine such as hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide, alkyl iodide, alkyl bromide, aryl iodide, aryl bromide, iodide salts, bromide salts and the like. Suitable non tlmitln g examples of such compounds of bromine and iodine include methyl iodide, methyl bromide, ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, ammonium iodide, ammonium bromide and the like. Generally, it is preferred that the amount of iodine precursor material added to the reaction system will be in an amount such that the atomic ratio of the iodine or bromine to the rhodium is above 2 1. Preferably, the atomic ratio of the iodine or bromine to the rhodium will be in a range of 5 1 to 5000 1. A more preferred atomic ratio of the iodine or bromine to the rhodium is 10 1 to 2500 1. Suitable substituted diphosphine stabilizers according to this invention include, but are not limited to bis diphenylphosphino methane, bis l,2 diphenylphos phino ethane, bis l,3 diphenylphosphino propane, bis dip tolylphosphino methane, bis l,2 di p tolylphosphino ethane, bis l,3 di p tolylphosphino propane, and the like. Suitable dibasic or polybasic carboxylic acid stabilizers include, but are not limited to, succinic acid, citric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, adipic acid, glutaricacid and the like. Other suitable stabilizer compounds, according to this invention, but are not limited to the halides, acetates, oxides, salts and the like of germanium, antimony and alkali metals. Where tin is employed as the stabilizer component, suitable sources of the tin component include, but are not limited to tin metal, stannous chloride, stannous oxide, organo tin compounds such as tetralkyl tin, stannic chloride, stannic oxide, stannous acetate and the like.The valence of the tin in the tin component may be 0 i.e.in tin metal , 2 or 4. The catalyst system forms by combining the foregoing rhodium and halogen in the presence of carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction medium. The liquid reaction medium employed may include any solvent compatible with the catalyst system and may include pure alcohols or mixtares of the alcohol feedstock and or the desired carboxylic acid and or esters of these two compounds. However, the preferred solvent or liquid reaction medium for the process of this invention is the desired carbonylation products such as the carboxylic acid and or ester of the acid and an alcohol. Water is also often in the reaction mixture to exert a beneficial effect upon the reaction rate. Suitable feedstock materials for the process are set out in U.S. Patent 3,845,121 previously incorporated by reference. Methanol and ethylene are two of the most preferred feedstocks that are utilized in the practice of our invention. In carrying out the carbonylation reaction, the above mentioned feedstocks are intimately contacted with carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction medium that contains the above mentioned catalyst system. The catalyst system can be preformed outside of the reactor by combining the necessary catalyst precursors or it can be formed in situ. Generally, the catalyst will be employed in such amounts as to provide a concentration of soluble rhodium in the reaction medium of from about 10 ppm to about 3000 ppm depending upon the equipment size, desired reaction time and other factors. Phe carbon monoxide reactant can be sparged inte the reactor in such a manner as to intimately contact the carbon monoxide with the reactants in the reaction mass.The pressure in the reactor will generally be maintained in the range of from 345 to about 10340 kPa. As disclosed in the prior art, the foregoing known carbonylation process is carried at a temperature range of from about 50 to about 500 C with a preferred temperature range of from about 1000 to about 250 C. The optimum temperature and pressure maintained in the reactor will vary depending upon the reactants and the par ticular catalyst system utilized. The catalyst, feedstock materials and general reaction parameters set out in the foregoing discussion are known in the art. A portion of the liquid phase reaction mass is withdrawn from the reactor and passed to a separation zone that is maintained at a pressure that is lower than the reactor pressure. This pressure reduction will cause at least a portion of the carbonylation products to vaporize and separate from the unvaporized residue of the liquid reaction mass. The aforementioned catalyst system will remain in this residue of unvaporized liquid reaction mass and can be recycled to the reactor. Generally, it is preferred that the separation zone be maintained at a pressure of at least 138 kPa lower than the pressure in the reactor. The pressure in the reactor is usually in the range of about 345 to 10340 kPa.Thus, the separation zone is maintained at a pressure less than 10200 kPa. It has been found that the separation zone can be maintained at very low pressure, even approaching a complete vacuum however, it is usually desirable that the separation zone be maintained at a positive pressure to eliminate vapor compression equipment and the like in handling the vaporized carbonylation products that are withdrawn from the separation zone. By maintaining pressure differential of at least 138 kPa between the reactor and the separation zone, a substantial amount of the carbonylation products can be vaporized from the liquid reaction mass. The exact pressure of the separation zone will vary, depending on the temperature and pressure maintained in the reactor. It is important that the pressure differential between the separation zone and the reactor be at least 138 kPa to insure vaporization of a substantial portion of the carbonylation products in the separation zone.It is also important that the total pressure in the separation zone be less than the vapor pressure of the carbonylation products in the liquid reaction mass withdrawn from the reactor at the temperature of the liquid reaction mass.For example, if at the temperature and pressure of the reactor the carbonylation products to be vaporized have a vapor pressure of 1380 kPa, the separation zone should be operated at a pressure of less than 1240 kPa. Preferably, the separation zone of this invention will be operated at a pressure of from about 69 to 1380 kPa. More preferably, the separation zone will be operated at a pressure of about 100 to 690 kPa. The separation zone should be large enough to allow the liquid reaction mass that is passed to it from the reactor to be maintained in said separation zone for a sufficient period of time to vaporize the desired carbonylation products, prior to recycling the unvaporized liquid containing the homogeneous cataly st system back to the reactor. Usually, a residence time of at least one minute in the separation zone is sufficient. Following separation of the desired carbonylation products, the unvaporized liquid portion of the reaction mass containing any precipitated catalyst decomposition products leaves the separation zone and is introduced into the suction of a recycle pump which increases the pressure of this stream sufficiently to permit its injection back into the reaction zone. The piping through which a portion of the reaction mass is withdrawn from the reaction zone, as well as the piping through which the liquid recycle stream is transferred back to the reaction zone by the recycle pump, will be at substantially the pressure of the reaction zone.As used herein, substantially the pressure of the reaction zone means the reaction zone pressure plus or minus pressure changes caused by fluid flow through the respec tive lines. Depending upon the temperature and pressure of the transfer piping, a minor amount of the carbonylation catalyst system according to the prior art i.e., not including the stabilizer component of the present inventio4, may decompose and precipitate from the liquid in the.piping. The catalyst system is believed to comprise a carbonyl complex of the rhodium component and the halide component, and it is further believed that carbon monoxide may be abstracted from a portion of the carbonyl complex form of the catalyst system, converting some of the catalyst to an insoluble form which may comprise a rhodium halide. Because the rhodium component of the catalyst system is quite expensive, it is desirable to recover any traces of precipitated catalyst for return to the reaction zone and reuse. According to the present invention, the rhodium catalyst is maintained in soluble form in these carbon monoxide deficient portions of the process by addition to the system a stabilizer component selected from 1 N,N,N ,N tetramethyl o phenylenediamine and 2,3 dipyridyl, 2 a substituted diphosphine having the formulaEMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are alkyl or aryl substituted alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or in which , R2, R4 and K5 are aryl or alkyl substituted aryl radicals having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and R3 is a polymethylene group having 1 3 carbon atoms, 3 a dibasic or polybasic carboxylic acid having the formulaEMI12.1 wherein Y1 is of the formula CX1X2 m in which m is 2 to 10 and wherein Y2, Y3, Y4 and v are of the formula CX1 X n in which n is 1 to 10, and X1 and X2 are independently selected from hydrogen, a halogen, lower alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, hydroxy substituted alkyl and carboxy substituted alkyl, or 4 a compound of germanium, antimony, tin, or an alkali metal. The stabilizer is employed in a molar ratio of at least about 0.5 to the rhodium present in the catalyst system. The stabilizer may be injected into the carbonylation reaction system at any convenient point, but is preferably injected into the transfer piping leading from the carbonylation reactor to the separation zone, or into the piping which conducts the catalyst containing recycle stream from the separation zone back to the reactor, in order to insure complete mixing of the stabilizer with the catalyst containing liquid system. The practice of this invention is illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way. In the following examples a stock solution was prepared which simulated the liquid contents of a totally backmixed carbonylation reactor in a typical acetic acid plant. Included in this solution were traces of iron, nickel, chromium and molybdenum normally found in an acetic acid plant as corrosion products. The stock solution employed acetic acid as the solvent and contained the following, unless specifically noted in the Examples. Iron 0.027 moles liter Nickel 0.019 Chromium 0.014 Molybdenum 0.007 Water 8.8 li Total iodide 1.40 Labile methyl 1.44 groups meth anol methyl iodide methyl acetate EXAMPLE 1 To establish a base run in which no stabilizer was present, the following experiment was performed.About 650 milliliters of the stock solution described above plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged to a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 710 kPa. The contents were heated with stirring and when a temperature of 185 C was reached methanol and methyl iodide were added. Temperature was maintained at 185 0C. The autoclave contents were sampled periodically and analyzed for dissolved rhodium which initially was 340 ppm. The results of these analyses were as follows Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 1 330 97 40 292 86 130 200 59 This experiment clearly demonstrates that in the absence of a catalyst stabilizer the rhodium rapidly precipitates from the solution in the autoclave. EXAMPLE 2 Using the equipment and procedure of Example 1, the base case run was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.0072 mols liter of N,N,N ,N tetramethyl o phenylenediamine. Total iodine and total labile methyl groups were as in Example 1 initially. Initial dissolved rhodium was 335 ppm. A sample was taken and analyzed after 121 minutes while the temperature was main tained at 183 1850C. Dissolved rhodium ran 300 ppm or 90 of the initial level. These results clearly indicate that the N,N,N , N tetramethyl o phenylenediamine stabilizer greatly retarded the rate of rhodium precipitation from the autoclave solution. EXAMPLE 3 The experiment of Example 1 was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.0036 moles liter of 2,3 dipyridyl as a stabilizer. The initial total iodine level and the initial total labile methyl groupscwere as in Example 1. The initial dissolved rhodium was 329 ppm. Autoclave temperature was 182 1860C. After 121 minutes, a sample was analyzed and dissolved rhodium ran 273 ppm or 83 of the initial level. EXAMPLE 4 To establish a base run in which no diphosphine stabilizer was present, the following experiment was performed. About 650 milliliters of the stock solution described above plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged into a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 550 kPa.The contents were heated with stirring and when a temperature of 185 C was reached methanol and methyl iodide were added. The autoclave contents were then immediately sampled and were found to contain 1.15 moles liter total iodine, 1.73 moles liter total labile methyl groups methyl iodide methanol methyl acetate and 348 parts per million ppm dissolved rhodium. The autoclave contents were sampled periodically and analyzed for dissolved rhodium. The results of these analyses were as follows Time After Methanol ppm Disolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Disolved Rhodium 1 152 44 11 55 16 21 31 9 31 12 3 66 12 3 126 10 3 Again, this experiment clearly demonstrates that in the absence of a catalyst stabilizer the rhodium rapidly precipitates from the solution in the autoclave. EXAMPLE 5 Using the equipment and procedure of Example 4, the base case run was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.0036 moles liter of bis l,3 diphenylphosphino propane. Total iodine and total labile methyl groups were as in Example 4 initially. Initial dissolved rhodium was 348 ppm. Samples were taken and analyzed periodically whilethe temperature was maintained at 183 191 0C and the following results obtained Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 1 275 79 11 239 69 21 235 68 31 215 62 61 169 49 131 90 26 These results clearly indicate that the diphosphine stabilizer greatly retarded the rate of rhodium precipitation from the autoclave solution. EXAMPLE 6 The experiment of Example 5 was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.0036 moles liter of bis 1,2 di p tolyphosphino ethane as a stabilizer. The initial total iodine level was 1.30 moles liter and the initial total labile methyl groups ran 1.30 moles liter. The initial dissolved rhodium was 348 ppm.Autoclave temperature was 183 186 0C. Periodic sampling for dissolved rhdoium gave the following results Minutes After ppm Dissolved of OriginalMethanol Addition Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 12 231 66 21 152 44 31 102 29 62 53 15 139 22 6 EXAMPLES 7 11 To illustrate the criticality of the require ment that the substituted diphosphine stabilizer of the present invention be of the formulaEMI16.1 in which R3 is a polymethylene group radical having 1 3 carbon atoms, a series of runs was conducted in the autoclave of Example 4.The procedure used was identical to that of the previous examples 4 6 except that after charging the autoclave and heating the contents to about 150 0C, under CO pressure, the autoclave was vented down to 205 kPa under nitrogen pressure and refluxed at this pressure.The temperature at which the autoclave contents boiled was 125 128 C. In each of the following runs, the acetic acid solvent in the autoclave contained 0.025 moles liter iron, 0.016 moles liter chromium, 0.01 moles liter molybdenum, 9.5 moles liter water and 0.35 moles liter total labile methyl groups. The autoclave contents were sampled periodically and analyzed for dissolved rhodium, the first sample being taken when refluxing began.The following data were obtained Time of Original Refluxed ppm Dissolved DisolvedExample Stabilizer minutes Rhodium Rhodium 7 None 0 404 100 30 336 83 60 249 62 90 166 41 150 79 20 8 bis 1,2 diphenyl 0 744 100 phosphino etzhane 30 1003 100 0.009 moles liter 60 1010 100 90 968 100 150 1041 100 9 bis 1,2 diphenyl 0 768 100 phosphino ethane 60 1006 100 0.0045 moles liter 150 1033 100 10 bis 1,4 diphenyl 0 414 100 phosphino butane 44 353 85 90 140 34 150 61 15 11 bis 1,6 diphenyl 0 357 100 phosphino hexane 30 292 82 75 133 37 150 44 12 Note The reason for the apparent increase in disolved rhodium in Examples 8 and 9 is not known but it is believed that the diphenylphosphinoethane stabilizer may have interfered in some way with the rhodium analysis. These examples illustrate that when R3 of the formula of the diphosphine is a polymethylene radical having more than 3 carbon atoms Examples 10 and 11 , the diphosphine is ineffective as a stabilizer, the results being,substantially the same as when no stabilizer is present Example 7 .

About 650 milliliters of the stock solution described above plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged into a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 791 kPa.The contents were heated with stirring and when a temperature of 1850C was reached methanol and methyl iodide were added. The autoclave contents were then immediately sampled and were found to contain 1.40 moles liter total iodide, 1.44 moles liter total labile methyl groups methyl iodide methanol methyl acetate and 340 parts per million ppm dissolved rhodium.

Peri odic sampling for dissolved rhodium gave the following results Minutes after ppm Dissolved of Original Methanol Addition Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 1 335 11 335 99 21 328 96 31 320 94 61 314 92 133 256 75 In the following examples a stock solution was prepared which employed acetic acid as the solvent and contained the following Iron 0.025 moles liter Nickel 0.02 Ii Chromium 0.016 Water 9.5 TI Total iodide 0.5 Labile methyl 0.35 groups methanol methyl iodide methyl acetate EXAMPLE 16 To establish a base run in which no stabilizer was present, the following experiment was performed. About 650 milliliters of the stock solution described above plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged into a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 791 kPa.The contents were heated with stirring and when a temp era ture of 150 155 0C was reached, methanol and methyl iodide were added. The autoclave contents were then immediately cooled to about 125 1280C under a pressure of 205 kPa and maintained in arefluxing condition. The initial dissolved.rhodium content was 444 ppm. The autoclave contents were sampled periodically and analyzed for dissolved rhodium. The results of these analyses were as follows Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 63 249 56 93 166 37 This experiment clearly demonstrates that in the absence of a catalyst stabilizer the rhodium rapidly precipitates from the solution in the autoclave. EXAMPLE 17 Using the equipment and procedure of Example 16, the base case run was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.0045 moles liter of Gel4. Total iodine and total labile methyl groups were as in Example 1 initially. After 85 minutes at a temperature of 128 1290C, the solution was analyzed and found to contain 379 ppm dissolved rhodium or 85 of the original dissolved rhodium. These results clearly indicate that the stabilizer greatly retarded the rate of rhodium precipitation from the autoclave solution. EXAMPLE 18 The experiment of Example 16 was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.2 moles liter of lithium acetate and 0.7 moles liter total iodide.Autoclave temperature was 126 1280C. Periodic sampling for dissolved rhodium gave the following results Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 61 318 72 91 249 56 EXAMPLE 19 The experiment of Example 16 was repeated using as a stabilizer 6.2 mole liter of potassium iodide. After 124 minutes of refluxing at 128 1290C, the solution was analyzed and found to contain 228 ppm or 51 of the original dissolved rhodium. EXAMPLE 20 To establish another base run under different conditions in which no stabilizer was present, the following experiment was performed. About 650 milliliters of a stock solution containing 0.027 moles liter iron, 0.019 moles liter nickel, 0.014 moles liter chromium,0.007 moles liter molybdenum, 1.40 moles liter total iodide, 8.9 moles liter water and 1.44 moles liter labile methyl groups using acetic acid as the solvent plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged into a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 791 kPa. The contents were heated with stirring and when a temperature of 1850 C was reached methanol and methyl iodide were added. Temperature was maintained at 185 C. The autoclave contents, which initially contained 416 ppm dissolved rhodium, were sampled and analyzed for dissolved rhodium after 61 minutes. Dissolved rhodium ran 168 ppm or 40 of the original. Again, this experiment clearly demonstrates that in the absence of a catalyst stabilizer the rhodium rapidly precipitates from the solution in the autoclave. EXAMPLES 21 23 The procedure of Example 20 was repeated using the stock solution of that Example and using the stabilizer compounds shown in the following Table. The results were as shown below. of OriginalExample Stabilizer Time ppm Dissolved Dissolved minutes Rhodium Rhodium 21 0.018 moles liter GeI4 Initial 392 61 286 73 22 0.018 moles liter Initial 396 SbCl3 60 216 55 23 0.0045 moles liter SbCl3 Initial 391 60 286 73 In the following examples a stock solution was prepared which employed acetic acid as the solvent and contained the following Iron 0.025 moles liter Nickel 0.02 II Chromium 0.016 Molybdenum O.01 Water 9.5 IT Total iodides 0.5 TI II Labile methyl 0.35 TI groups methyl iodidermethanol methyl acetate EXAMPLE 24 To establish a base run in which no tin component stabilizer was present, the following experiment was performed. About 650 milliliters of the stock solution described above plus a rhodium solution and hydrogen iodide was charged into a 1500 milliliter stirred autoclave and pressured with carbon monoxide to a pressure of 791 kPa. The contents were heated with stirring and when a temperature of 150 155 C was reached methanol and methyl iodide were added. The autoclave contents were then immediately cooled to 125 1280C under a pressure of 205 kPa, refluxed, and were sampled and found to contain 444 parts per million ppm dissolved rhodium. The autoclave contents were sampled periodically and analyzed for dissolved rhodium. The results of these analyses were as follows Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 63 249 56 93 166 37 153 79 18 This experiment clearly demonstrates that in the absence of a catalyst stabilizer the rhodium rapidly precipitates from the solution in the autoclave. EXAMPLE 25 Using the equipment and procedure of Example 24 the base case run was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained 0.00512 moles liter of anhydrous SnC14. Total iodine and total labile methyl groups were as in Example 24 initially. Initial dissolved rhodium was 434 ppm. Samples were taken and analyzed periodically while the temperature was maintained at 125 126 C and the following results obtained Time After Methanol ppm Dissolved of OriginalAddition minutes Rhodium Dissolved Rhodium 62 462 106 128 462 106 These results clearly indicate that the tin stabilizer greatly retarded the rate of rhodium precipitation from the autoclave solution. EXAMPLES 26 30 To show the variety of tin components which may be used as stabilizers, the experiment of Example 24 was repeated except that the autoclave solution contained the tin components shown in the following Table as a stabilizer. The initial total iodine level and the initial total labile methyl groups were as in Example 24 and the initial dissolved rhodium was as shown in the Table. Periodic samples for dissolved rhodium gave the results shown. In all cases, the tin component was present in a concentration of 0.0045 moles liter, except in Example 26 the tin component concentration was 0.0046 moles liter.
