# Particulate structure and element for analysis or transport of a liquid and method of making said element.

## Abstract
An element for the analysis or transport of liquid contains a structure 3 comprising heat stable, organic polymer parti cles 4 non swellable in and impermeable to the liquid, and an adhesive 5 concentrated on the surfaces of adjoining particles in the areas of contact 7 and bonding the particles into a coherent, three dimensional lattice that is non swellable in the liquid. The lattice structure has intercon nected voids 9 among the particles representing a total void volume of 25 to 80 percent. The adhesive comprises an organic polymer different from that of the particles and insol uble in the liquid under analysis. The amount of adhesive in the structure is less than 10 weight percent of the particles.
