# Earthquake insulating bearing assembly.

## Abstract
An earthquake insulating bearing assembly is mounted between a foundation 11 and a building structure 12 . A first friction member 15 is fixedly secured to a lower surface of the building structure 12 . An elastic bearing 17 is interposed between and fixed relative to an upper surface 11a of the foundation and the lower surface of the building structure 12 . A guide means 24 is vertically mounted on the upper surface of the foundation. A second friction member 27 of an annular shape is disposed around the elastic bearing and is engaged with the guide means for vertical movement therealong. An urging means 28 is fixed relative to the upper surface of the foundation for urging the second friction member 27 into frictional engagement with the first friction member 15 under a selected load. The urging means comprises means 31 for adjusting the load applied to the second friction member.
