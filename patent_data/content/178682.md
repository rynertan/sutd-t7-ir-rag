## Description
1,3 BIS lH 1,2,4 TRIAZOL l YL 2 FLUORO 2 2,4 DIFLUOROPHENYL PROPANE, ANTIFUNGAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING IT, AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF THE COMPOUND AND THE COMPOSITION This invention relates to 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 fluoro 2 2,4 difluorophenyl propane, an antifungal compound, pharmaceutical compositions containing it and their use in treating fungal infections in animals, including humans. U.S. Patent 4,404,216 Richardson discloses that 1,3 bis lH l,2,4 triazol l yl 2 2,4 difluoro phenyl propan 2 ol and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are useful for treating fungal infections in animals. European Patent Application No. 96,569, published December 21, 1983, and assigned to Pfizer Limited, discloses 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol l yl 2 aryl 2 halopropane antifungal compounds which are generic to the compound of this invention. However, there is no specific disclosure of the compound of this invention. The compound of this invention, 1,3 bis lH l,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 fluoro 2 2,4 difluorophenyl pro pane, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof p sesses advantageous antifungal properties and low toxicity. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective antifungal amount of 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 fluoro 2 2,4 difluorophenyl propane or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention exhibit extended shelf lifetime. The present invention further provides a method of treating susceptible fungal infections which comprises administering to a host, e.g., a warm blooded animal such as man, in need of such treatment 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol l yl 2 fluoro 2 2,4 difluorophenyl propane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a compound or a salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The compound of this invention may be prepared by reacting 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 2,4difluorophenyl propan 2 ol with an active fluorinating reagent such as SF4 or N,N diethylaminosulfur trifluoride Et2NSF3 in a suitable organic solvent e.g., dry tetrahydrofuran THF or dry methylene chloride at a temperature of from about 100C to the reflux temperature, preferably at about 100 to 0 C optionally in the presence of a base. The product is isolated and purified in a conventional manner, e.g. by column chromatography. 1,3 Bis lH 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 2 2,4 difluorophenyl propan 2 ol is a known compound which may be prepared in accordance with the procedures disclosed in USP 4,404,216. The compound of the present invention and ketoconazole, a present commercial antifungal product, when tested in conventional antifungal screening tests, exhibited negligible in vitro activity against a large number of fungi in Sabourand broth medium but the compound of this invention exhibited significantly lower in vitro activity against six strains of Candida in Eagle medium compared to ketoconazole. The compound of this invention had a mean Minimum Inhibitory Concentration MIC of 4 mcg mL after 48 hours the MIC for ketoconazole was 0.031 mgc mL. However, the compound of the present invention exhibited superior antifungal activity in in vivo tests in animals compared to ketoconazole.For example, in a mouse Candida albicans oral infection model, the preventive dosage of the compound of the present invention required for survival of 100 of the test animals was lower than that required for ketoconazole. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective antifungal amount of l,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol l yl 2 fluoro 2 2,4 difluorophenyl propane or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are nontoxic acid addition salts and or adducts formed by adding to the compound of the present invention about a stoichiometric amount of a mineral acid, such as HC1, HBr, H2SO4 or H3PO4 or of an organic acid, such as acetic, propionic, valeric, oleic, palmitic, stearic, lauric, benzoic, lactic, para toluene sulfonic, methane sulfonic, citric, maleic fumaric, succinic and the like, respectively. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated by combining the compound of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and or adduct thereof with any suitable, i.e., inert, pharmaceutical carrier or diluent adapted for administration orally, parentally or topically in a variety of formulations. The preferred mode of administration is oral. Examples of suitable compositions include solid or liquid compositions for oral administration such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, solutions, suspensions or emulsions. They may also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, physiological saline or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. Parenteral forms to be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously are usually in the form of a sterile solution, and may contain salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. Based on the greater in vivo oral activity for the compound of this invention compared to ketoconazole, the dosage of the compound of the present invention employed to combat a given fungal infection in animals, e.g., man, is likely to be generally somewhat less than the dosage requirements of present commercial products such as ketoconazole. In general, the dosage for man ranges from about 50 mg per day to about 800 per day, with about 100 mg to 400 mg per day in single or divided doses being preferred. It will be appreciated that the actual preferred dosages of the compound of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will vary according to the particular composition formulated, the mode of application and the particular situs, host and disease being treated. Many factors that modify the action of the drug will be taken into account by the attending clinician, e.g., age, body weight, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, condition of the host, drug combinations, reaction sensitivities and severity of the disease. Administration can be carried out continuously or periodically within the maximum tolerated dose. Optimal application rates for a given set of conditions can be readily ascertained by the attending clinician using conventional dosage determination tests. The following Examples illustrate the invention.
