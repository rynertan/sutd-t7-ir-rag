# A communication system.

## Abstract
A communication system between a tractor 2 and an agricultural implement 1 comprising a communication medium, such as a single cable. To the single cable devices, such as sensors 4,5 , controllers 6,7,8 etc. are connected through a terminal unit 11,15 . Each terminal unit has a characteristic code word assigned to. Messages are being transmitted in the form of series of pulses and converted into parallel signals in each terminal unit.

## Claims
A communication system for transmission of messages between a controlled apparatus and a controlling apparatus, in particular an agricultural implement and a tractor, with a communication medium between these apparatus, with, on the agricultural implement, remotely electrically controlled controlling devices and electrical sensing devices providing measure values, and, on the tractor, an operating panel displaying operating devices and indication devices for representing values measured by the sensing devices, characterized in that the sensing devices, the controlling devices, the operating devices and the indication devices are each connected to the communication medium by means of a terminal unit in the form of a transmitter receiver, and the terminal unit comprises electric circuit means for coding and recognizing a characteristic recognition signal for the connected device, a circuit for the conversion of parallel signals into a series of pulses and circuits for the transmission and reception of the series of pulses.

## Description
This invention relates to a communication system such as described in the preamble of claim 1. In this known communication system, which is generally applied in agriculture, a separate conductor or plurality of conductors is reserved in the cable for each device connected to the communication system. When the number of devices is large this leads to a large number of conductors, so that the cable, which connects the agricultural implement to the tractor, becomes very thick. Moreover, the connecting plugs at each end of the cable are large and expensive. Considering the nature of the industry, there is a large chance of contaminating the connectors. There exists a tendency to increase the number of sensors, indicating devices, control devices and operating devices, so that the above mentioned difficulties are more likely to increase than decrease. Another difficulty is that upon malfunction of one conductor the other conductors present in the cable remain functioning correctly, so that the user notices relatively late that a defect has occurred in the communication system. The invention has for its aim to eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages. This is achieved in accordance with the invention by the features such as are described in the characterizing part of claim 1. Owing to the features mentioned, it suffices to have a connecting cable with just a few conductors, for example for the power supply and the signals, or a single wireless transmission channel. Admittedly more time is needed for the serial transmission of the signal pulses, but considering the speed of electronics as opposed to mechanical control devices, this is not a disadvantage. Another advantage of the present invention is that a defect in the communication medium is immediately noticeable, since all communication between the agricultural implement and the tractor will be terminated. If there is employed a simple, inexpensive standard cable of which supplies can be stocked, the user can quickly restore communication by replacing the cable. A further standardization which benefits the simplicity is achieved by the features such as are described in claim 2. Each terminal unit serves here as an interface adapter unit between the connected device and the electronics associated with the cable. The invention will be further elucidated by reference to the drawings. In the drawings, in schematic fashion The agricultural implement in the form of a bale press 1 is towed by a tractor and controlled from the tractor by means of operating panel 3. For providing information to the operator, a number of sensors, for instance 4 and 5, are mounted on the implement. For control, use is made of hydraulic valves such as 6 and 7, which operate piston 8. In accordance with the invention, signals orginating from the sensors such as 9 and 10 see figure 2 are converted in terminal unit 11 into a series of pulse formed signals which are transmitted over thin cable 12 via connector plugs 13 and 14 to terminal unit 15 on the tractor. Terminal unit 15 converts inter alia the series of pulse signals into parallel signals for operating panel 3, in order to communicate the functioning of the bale press to the operator via operating panel 3. On the operating panel there are also situated control devices which, depending upon their position, send out control signals in parallel form to terminal unit 15, where they are converted to a series of signal pulses and sent via cable 12 to terminal unit 11. Terminal unit 11 converts the series of control pulses into parallel signals and sends these to connected hydraulic valves 16. Figure 3 shows another embodiment in which each connected device, namely a sensing device, control device, operating device or indicator device, is connected directly to cable 17, which is arranged as a ring main, via its own terminal unit in the form of a transmitter receiver, which terminal unit also functions as interface adapter unit. The cable is used in a time sharing fashion according to a specific hierarchy of the terminal units. It is sufficient to use a very thin standard cable which can be mounted into the implement during production, and to which terminal units and their associated devices can be connected later as required. Operating panel 3 is also connected to the cable via terminal unit 18. Terminal unit 18 takes the form of a microprocessor which picks up the signals from the sensors through the cable, and sends control pulses for the control device via cable 17. The information transfer is digitalized. Figure 4 shows, on a larger scale, the connection to cable 17 of a control device in the form of a hydraulic valve. The circuit for recognition of the address code intended for this unit is accommodated on printed circuit 19. The printed circuit is shown in series with cable 17. It should be noted however that inductive coupling can also be applied by means of an induction coil wound around cable 17. Upon recognition of a message intended for this unit, the message is further transmitted to circuit 20, which forms the control signals for hydraulic valve 21. It should be noted that if the communication medium is a wireless connection, the controlled apparatus must have its own supply source for electrical power. It is preferable that different kinds of agricul tural implements can cooperate with the same controlling tractor. To this end, the argricultural implement can be assigned a code word characteristic of the kind of implement, the tractor then being provided with means for identifying the code word. The controlling program is then selected in dependance on the code word, by means of either software or hardware. Moreover, particularly in the case of wireless transmission, it is desirable that the communication is unambiguous. To this end, each controlling and each controlled apparatus can be assigned a code word which couples operation of these apparatuses, which code word is always transmitted at the start of transmission of a message, so that only the apparatus concerned reacts to the message. The intended code words can be fixed words, or can be arbitrarily generated at the start of the communication connection and stored by the receiving unit.
