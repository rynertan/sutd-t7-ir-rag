Of particular interest are immunoglobulins or specific binding fragments thereof. A variety of metals may be employed as the radionuclide M.These metals include copper, e.g., ⁶⁷Cu, and ⁶⁴Cu, technetium, e.g. The esters are those esters which are known to provide for the reaction with a polypeptide in aqueous medium. One or another of the esters may be preferred, depending upon the particular radionuclide, the protein, and the conditions for conjugation. Common esters which find use are the The polypeptide compounds may be varied widely, depending upon the nature of the use of the radionuclide. Thus, the compounds may be ligands or receptors. Ligands may include such a variety of compounds as hormones, lymphokines, growth factors, substrates, particularly compounds binding to surface membrane receptors, where the complex may remain bound to the surface or become endocytosed. Among receptors are surface membrane receptors, antibodies, enzymes, naturally occurring receptors, lectins, and the like. Of particular interest are immunoglobulins or their equivalent, which may involve Fab fragments, F ab ₂, F.., T cell receptors, etc. The invention is furthermore directed to compounds of the following formula wherein one of Z¹, Z², Z³ or Z⁴ is RCW HNV R is a divalent organic radical of at least one carbon atom and not more than six carbon atoms, usually from 1 to 3 carbon atoms having from 0 to 2 heteroatoms which are chalcogen O, S or nitrogen and is aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic, preferably aliphatic having from 0 to 2, usually 0 to 1 site of aliphatic unsaturation, e.g. ethylenic, and of from 1 to 2 carbon atoms T is an acyl or acylthio radical of from 2 to 10, usually 2 8 carbon atoms, either a hydrocarbyl acyl or substituted acylradical, usually aryl e.g. phenyl or alkyl, e.g. methyl, an organic sulfhydryl radical of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, either substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, a heterocycle, particularly a chalcogen O, S heterocycle, an acylamidomethylene, where the acyl group is as defined above, hydrogen, sulfonato, an alkali metal ion or the two T s may be taken together to define a polyvalent metal radionuclide, as the metal ion or metal ion oxide substituents include, nitro, cyano, inert halo aryl or polyhalo , carbonyl carboxylic acid, amide and ester , and the like Y is hydroxyl, an oxy salt, particularly an alkali metal salt, e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium, an organic oxy compound forming an ester, usually lower alkoxy of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a group which permits amide formation in an aqueous medium, particularly with a polypeptide, NH₂, NHNH₂ The link between CW and the polypeptide will vary depending upon the nature of CW Y. Where CW Y is a carboxyl functionality, then the linkage will be either a carboxamide or amidine depending on whether W is O or NH. If, however, CW Y defines a methyleneamine or methylenehydrazine, then reductive amination may be required with a sugar substituted polypeptide which has been cleaved to the oxo group, e.g., glycol cleavage with periodate. Reductive amination may be achieved by combining the oxo substituted polypeptide with the amino or hydrazino substituted N₂S₂ ligand in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride. A preferred group of compounds will have the following formula wherein all of the symbols have been defined previously except for T , and wherein T is a sulfur protective group, which includes acyl, acylthio, hydrocarbylthio or substituted hydrocarbylthio or heterocyclicthio, where the acyl and hydrocarbyl groups may be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or combinations thereof and the acyl group further includes heterocyclic, wherein acyl is normally carboxyacyl T will generally be of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, 2 to 10, usually 2 to 8 carbon atoms when acyl, where substituents will include non oxo carbonyl carboxy , halo aryl , particularly fluoro and chloro, cyano and nitro. The ω, ω x diamino aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic acids, will be of from 4 to 10, usually from 4 to 7 carbon atoms and are known compounds, or can be readily prepared in conventional ways or as described herein. For example, vicinal dibromides may be combined with aqueous ammonia under mild conditions. The amino groups may then be derivatized by reacting the hydrochloride salt of the diamino ester, e.g., lower alkyl ester, with an α haloacyl chloride, e.g., chloroacetyl chloride, in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, e.g., toluene, followed by substitution of the chloro groups with a mercapto group employing an appropriate derivative of hydrogen sulfide, e.g., sodium benzthiolate, sodium thioacetate, An alternative approach, employed for the 4,5 diaminopentanoate employs the readily available glutamate. After forming the 5 carboxy ester, the amino group is protected and the acid group 1 carboxyl preferentially reduced to the alcohol. The alcohol is transformed into an active cleaving group, e.g. halide or pseudohalide, followed by displacement with a nitrogen anion, e.g. azide, which serves as an intermediate to the amino group. After catalytic reduction of the amino intermediate to amino and hydrolysis of the ester, the amino groups are acylated with S protected α mercaptoacyl groups. The protective groups may be, removed, exchanged or otherwise modified, e.g. by introduction of water solubilizing groups. Various synthetic procedures may be employed for preparing the different N₂S₂ chelate rings. Carboxamides may be formed and reduced using aluminum or borohydrides to form the amine. Amines may be alkylated with aliphatic halides. Ethylene or propylene diamines or carboxyalkylalkylene diamines may be used to link thioglycolic acids. Other synthetic procedures may also be employed depending on the N₂S₂ ligand of interest. The imidate may be employed by preparing the nitrile of the amino protected The S protective groups may be varied widely, being acyl groups, thio groups or other compound which provides protection of the thio group during the subsequent manipulations and can be readily removed without deleterious effect on the peptide conjugate. Illustrative groups include benzoyl, acetyl, The protective groups may be removed in a variety of ways. Thioesters may be hydrolyzed using aqueous ammonia, sodium alkoxide in alkanol, or any conventional technique. Disulfides may be cleaved with dithiothreitol, glutathione, β mercaptoethylamine or other conventional reagent. Cleavage of the disulfide may occur prior to or after conjugation to the polypeptide. Depending upon the particular metal, various conditions and techniques will be employed for preparing the metal chelate. To prepare the technetium chelate, the chelating compound as carboxylate or activated ester is combined with a pertechnetate solution in the presence of a reducing agent, e.g., stannous or dithionite under conventional conditions, whereby the technetium chelate is formed as a stable salt. The rhenium chelate may be formed by reducing perrhenate with stannous ion in the presence of citrate and the N₂S₂ ligand. Yields are 50 or greater after 1hr at 50 C. The chelated acid may be already esterified or esterified in accordance with conventional ways. If already esterified, a labile complex such as Tc 99m gluconate will be prepared which will allow exchange to the N₂S₂ activated ester ligand forming a complex suitable for protein conjugation. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid may be activated by employing a water soluble carbodiimide, e.g., EDCI, in an aqueous medium in the presence of at least a stoichiometric amount, preferably an excess of the hydroxylic compound. A suitably buffered aqueous medium may be employed. Excess carbodiimide can be converted to urea by adding acetate. The aqueous medium may then be used directly without further purification for conjugation to the polypeptide. Desirably, the polypeptide will be added to the ester containing aqueous medium at a convenient concentration at a mildly alkaline pH, generally in excess of about 7.5 and less than about 9 and the reaction allowed to proceed for a sufficient time for all of the active ester to either react with the polypeptide or be substantially completely hydrolyzed. Usually, the time will be less than about 6hr and more than about 30min, with temperatures ranging from about 0 to 50 C, usually not exceeding about 40 C. The particular conditions will be selected in accordance with the particular activated ester, the pH, the activity of the polypeptide, and the like. It is also feasible but less preferable to conjugate the chelating agent N₂S₂ to the polypeptide in the absence of the metal ion. The carboxylic acid group would be linked to the polypeptide to form a stable covalent link, e.g., an amide linkage, followed by the addition of the metal in a reduced, chelated, exchangeable form. As chelates, α or β dioxo compounds are useful. Conveniently, the metal ion could be added as a weakly chelated ion or in the presence of a weakly chelating group, such as a uronate, e.g. gluconate. The subject chelates will be administered to the mammalian host, normally by injection, intravenously, intra arterially, peritoneally, intratumorally, or the like, depending upon the particular site at which the radionuclide is desired. Generally, from about 0.1 to 2ml will be injected into a host, depending upon the size of the host, with about 0.001 to 50µCi kg of host. For human hosts the dosage will usually be about 10 50mCi 70kg host, more usually about 25 35mCi 70kg host. For lower mammals, e.g. mice, 1µCi for biodistribution studies, while up to or greater than 500µCi for imaging studies. After administration of the radionuclide, depending upon its purpose, the host may be treated in various ways for detection or therapy. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. In a dry flask under nitrogen is placed 1.54g 0.010mole of 3,4 diaminobutyric acid hydrochloride and 250ml of absolute ethanol. Dry HCl gas is then bubbled into the solution. The mixture is refluxed for one to two days until formation of the ethyl ester is complete.

Upon completion of the reaction, sodium acetate is added to quench unreacted ECDI and the solution is ready for use for conjugation. The protein to be conjugated is dissolved in 0.2M borate buffer, pH 8.5 to 9.0, to a protein concentration of about 2 to 5mg ml. The mixture is allowed to stand at 4 C until all of the protein has dissolved. To the aqueous protein solution at a pH adjusted to 8.5 9 is added the ester solution and the pH readjusted if necessary. The resulting conjugate is then preparatively chromatographed on an HPLC gel filtration column with 0.05M phosphate, pH 7.4, buffer as eluant.
