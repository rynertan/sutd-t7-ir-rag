# Hermetically sealed galvanic cell having safety vent construction.

## Abstract
An hermetically sealed galvanic cell having a safety vent assembly comprising a housing 22, 24 having a portion 30 which is inwardly depressed and flexible, which portion 30 surrounds an aperture. The aperture is filled with a layer 34 of glass or ceramic material thus producing an hermetically sealed cell which exhibits increased mechanical strength cou pled with reliable venting. When the internal pressure of the cell exceeds a predetermined limit, the inwardly depressed portion 30 of the housing 22, 24 will flex outwardly thereby fracturing the hermetic seal and providing a vent passage from the cell.
