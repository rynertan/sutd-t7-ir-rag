# ISOTHERMAL FORGING LUBRICATING COMPOSITION AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A lubricating composition for use in the isothermal forging or sizing of metal workpieces in a hot die, comprises more than 50 , preferably 85 to 99 by weight of a vitreous component which fuses at a temperature above 500 F and below the temperature of the hot die during forging and less than 50 , preferably 15 to 1 , by weight of a finely divided abrasive component having a melting point above 2000 F, a hardness at room temperature of from 5.5 to 10.0 Mohs, and a particle size of from 1 to 75 microns, the abrasive component being non reactive with the metal workpiece and the die at forging temperatures. Such a composition is applied to the workpiece prior to forging in the form of a precoat composition.
