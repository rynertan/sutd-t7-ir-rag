# Semiconductor casing.

## Abstract
A casing for an electrical component comprises a metal base member. A metal housing member is mounted on the base member to provide a hollow enclosed casing for receiving the electrical component. A metal liead frame is provided within the enclosed casing and is electrically con nected to the electrical component. The lead frame has terminal leads projecting between the base member and the housing member external to the casing. The improvement comprises a device extending from the base member for strengthening the base member and providing additional heat transfer from the casing. Also, an adhesive seals and bonds the terminal leads to both the base member and to the housing member to form the enclosed casing.
