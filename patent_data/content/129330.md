# Ink jet print head.

## Abstract
The head is provided for a conductive ink 16 and com prises a container 14 having a capillary nozzle 18 where the ink is in contact with a pair of electrodes facing each other across the nozzle, in such a way as to be covered by a pre determined depth of ink between the electrodes and the meniscus 52 at the front end of the nozzle. Printing is effected by vaporization of a portion of ink in a section of the nozzle between the electrodes, which expels the said depth of ink, the container is closed by an insulating plate 30 over which extends a metal strip 37 of smaller width than the diameter of the nozzle. The nozzle is formed by means of a single hole through the plate and the strip, whereby the strip is separated the two electrodes. The metal strip may be disposed between the plate and a front dielectric alyer 43. The latter may also be covered by a second insulating layer having a front part of the nozzle therethrough, while the first dielectric layer may have a hole which is larger in diameter than the nozzle so as to create a reserve of ink for the frequent dots. For a multi nozzle head, the nozzles are produced through an insulating plate over which extend the strips for a plurality of pairs of electrodes.
