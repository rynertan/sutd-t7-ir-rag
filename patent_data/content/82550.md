# Apparatus for stringing a racket frame.

## Abstract
An apparatus for lacing the lateral strings in a racket frame which has already been strung with the longitudinal strings thereof. The apparatus has a lower beam provided in its upper part with two staggered longitudinal rows of vertical slots, the spacing of the slots of each row corresponding to twice the pitch distance of the longitudinal strings of the racket frame, in which corresponding slots of the two rows form pairs of slots and in which the upper side of the lower beam forms string support surfaces between the pairs of slots. An upper gripper beam is vertically movable with respect to the lower beam between an open and a closed position which gripper beam has downwardly facing string gripping surfaces likewise arranged in pairs associated with the pairs of slots of the lower beam. The gripping surfaces of each pair are separated by a downwardly extending lug portion. By mounting the apparatus crosswise on the longitudinal strings with the lower beam extending below and the gripper beam extending above these strings in a position in which alternate longitudinal strings are situated opposite the slots of one of said rows, on closing the apparatus a shed will be formed in the longitudinal strings allowing an easy passage of a lateral string therethrough. By opening the apparatus and shifting the same laterally until the adjacent longitudinal strings are situated opposite the slots and then again closing the apparatus, the shed can be changed for lacing in the next lateral string.
