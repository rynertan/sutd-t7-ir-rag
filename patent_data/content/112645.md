# Apparatus for detecting and determining the distribution of radioactivity on a medium.

## Abstract
A detecting head assembly provides output signals re lating to individual ionizing events due to radioactive decay of material in a medium such as a radiochromatogram or electrophoretogram. The detecting head assembly com prises a scanning head which includes an ionization chamber comprising two spaced detecting electrodes each including an array of spaced conductors. The conductors extend transversely of one another to provide a plurality of conductor crossing points. A mask having a plurality of radi ation transmissive zones or apertures is supported relative to the detecting electrodes such that said zones or aper tures respectively correspond with the conductor crossing points. The scanning head is slidably supported in juxtapo sition with a sample receiving zone and is driven by a stepper motor or motors to cause the scanning head, and hence the mask, to scan a predetermined path, whereby the radiation transmissive zones or apertures in the mask ex pose corresponding conductor crossing points to respective scanning regions on a sample. Signal processing means, connected to the conductors, include means for coding the output signals with regard to position co ordinates of the in dividual ionizing events detected in said scanning regions of said ionization chamber means, and a processor for pro cessing the coded signals in order to provide an output re lated to the distribution of radioactivity.
