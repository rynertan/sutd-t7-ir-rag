## Description
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing compound superconductors, such as A 15, Chevrel, and B 1 type compound superconductors. Commercially available compound superconductors are Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga. These superconductors are prepared by surface diffusion or a composite treatment which utilizes diffusion reactions between metal elements. Upper critical magnetic field of these compound superconductors are as low as about 20 tesla T . Examples of compound superconductors prepared on the experimental basis are Nb₃Aℓ, Nb₃Ga, Nb₃Ge, Nb₃ AℓGe and the like of A 15 type compound superconductors, PbMo₆S₈ and the like of Chevrel type compound superconductors, and NbN and the like of B 1 type compound superconductors. Among the three types of compound superconductors, Nb₃Aℓ, PbMo₆S₈ and NbN have critical temperatures of 18.9 K, 14.4 K and 17.3 K, and critical fields of 30 T, 50 to 60 T and 30 to 50 T, respectively. Thus, they have better superconducting properties than existing commercial available superconductors. If the A 15, Chevrel and B 1 type compound superconductors, however, are to be prepared by surface diffusion, their particle size is increased due to the high diffusion temperature required. As a result, when a resultant superconductor is used to form a superconductor magnet, its most significant characteristic, i.e., a critical current density, is greatly reduced. The compound superconductors can also be prepared by vapor deposition such as sputtering or CVD. According to such a method, however, the compound superconductors are prepared on only the experimental level due to a low deposition rate. Maximum dimensions of a resultant superconductor are a width of 1 cm, a length of several centimeters, and a thickness of about 2 to 3 µm atmost. Although a superconductor tape having a length of several meters was reported, it had variations in superconducting characteristics along its longitudinal direction and could not be used in practical applications. According to the above conventional methods of manufacturing compound superconductors, it is difficult to manufacture a long superconductor tape. In addition, good superconductive characteristics can only be obtained if the thickness is only about 2 to 3 µm. As a result, critical current Ic is as low as several 100 mA. According to Applied Physics, Letters, vol. 39, no. 2, August 1981, pages 277 279, the critical current density of CVD grown Nb₃Ge films can be enhanced by laser annealing. Niobium nitride NbN Sputtering is known as a method suitable for preparing an NbN nonequilibrium phase. According to this method, an Nb target and a substrate are placed in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is evacuated to a vacuum of 0.1 0.01 Nm ² 10 ⁶ to 10 ⁷ Torr . Ar and N₂ gases are supplied to the vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10,000 100 Nm ² 10 ¹ to 10 ³ Torr and RF power is supplied between the Nb plate and the substrate to generate Ar and N₂ gas plasmas. Ar ions are then sputtered to remove Nb atoms from the Nb target. The Nb atoms react with N until the atoms reach the substrate, thereby forming an NbN film on the substrate. An NbN δ phase film having good superconducting characteristics can thus be obtained. With sputtering, however, using a vacuum chamber degrades productive efficiency. In addition, the shape of an NbN film formed is limited. It is difficult to form samples of a long wire or of a large area. Furthermore, since the NbN film formation rate is low, a long period of time is required. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of easily and stably manufacturing long or large A 15, Chevrel, and B 1 type compound superconductors with good superconducting characteristics, high critical temperatures, and high critical magnetic field without impairing the superconducting characteristics. In accordance with the present invention, a method of manufacturing A 15, Chevrel and B 1 type compound superconductors comprises the first step of preparing a starting body consisting of a mixture of metal powders containing components of the compound superconductor to be manufactured, and a second step of irradiating a laser beam on at least part of the mixture of said metal powders to melt the mixture and solidifying the mixture to form a compound superconductor layer, the laser beam having a power density not less than 10⁴W cm². According to the present invention, powders containing components of the compound superconductor to be manufactured are mixed to obtain a predetermined composition. Or a powder molded or sintered body obtained by using some of the components is dipped in a solution containing the components so that the molded or sintered body is impregnated with the solution. Thus a starting body for the compound superconductor is prepared. The starting body is then irradiated with a laser beam to heat and melt at least part of the starting body. Superconductor components are combined with the melted portion of the starting body, and are solidified to form a compound layer of a predetermined composition. Therefore, a superconductor layer having uniform and good superconducting characteristics can be formed. This invention can be more fuly understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A first embodiment of the present invention will be described. In this embodiment, a starting body for an A 15, Chevrel, or B 1 type compound superconductor is prepared in the first step. In the second step, the body is irradiated with a laser beam to melt at least part of the body, and a compound superconductor layer is then formed in the body. More specifically, the body is irradiated with a laser beam in a vacuum or in Ar gas. A laser beam power density is 10⁴ W cm² or higher. If the laser power density is less than 10⁴ W cm², the body is neither sufficiently heated nor does reaction occur between the constituting elements. In this case, a compound superconductor cannot be obtained. In the second step, the body is preferably heat treated before and after melting upon radiation of the laser beam, to obtain a better result. Heat treatment helps improve the superconducting characteristics. In particular, heat treatment prior to melting of the body upon radiation of the laser beam causes a preliminary reaction between the constituting elements, to assist formation of a superconductor when the body is melted upon irradiation of the laser beam. It should be noted that the heat treatment temperature must fall within the range of 400 to 2,000 C. If the heat treatment temperature is less than 400 C, the reaction between the constituting elements does not progress substantially. However, if the heat treatment temperature exceeds 2,000 C, a compound other than the superconductor is undesirably formed. Heat treatment after radiation of the laser beam improves crystallinity of the resultant compound, and helps improve the superconducting characteristics. In this case, the heat treatment temperature must fall within the range between 300 to 1,500 C. When the heat treatment temperature is less than 300 C, element diffusion substantially does not occur, and crystallinity cannot be improved. However, if the temperature exceeds 1,500 C, the crystal grains become coarse and the superconducting characteristics are degraded. According to this embodiment, an A 15, Chevrel, or B 1 type compound superconductor having good superconducting characteristics can be easily prepared by rapid heating and cooling upon irradiation of the laser beam. More specifically, the molded body prepared in the first step of this embodiment is simply irradiated with a laser beam in the second step. The laser beam may be fixed while the molded body is moved at high speed or vice versa, thereby easily allowing the preparation of a long superconductive layer. In addition, a superconductor layer having a thickness of about several 100 µm can be formed by radiation of the laser beam. As a result, a superconductor having a sufficiently high critical current Ic can be obtained. According to this embodiment, a long compound superconductor layer having a higher critical temperature Tc, critical magnetic field Bc₂, and critical current density Jc than those of existing commercially available compound superconductors such as Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga can be easily prepared. Therefore, the compound superconductor of this embodiment can contribute to a promising superconductor magnet for generating a stronger magnetic field. The conventional Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga superconductors are prepared by a composite treatment method which requires many operations such as drawing, extrusion, and intermediate annealing. In addition, a last process, i.e., thermal diffusion, requires several tens of hours to several hundreds of hours. However, according to the method of the present invention, the superconductor can be prepared by laser annealing in a short period of time, thereby greatly reducing the manufacturing cost. Examples of the present invention will be described below. 99 pure Nb powder and 99.9 pure Aℓ powder were mixed at a ratio of Nb 25at Aℓ to obtain a mixture for an A 15 type compound superconductor as sample No. 1. The mixture was filled in a Cu tube having an outer diameter of 10 mm and an inner diameter of 8 mm. Both open ends of the Cu tube were welded and sealed, and the Cu tube was drawn. The drawn wire was rolled to obtain a tape. The outer Cu tube was then removed by nitric acid. The resultant Nb Aℓ power mixture tape had a thickness of 0.5 mm and a width of 3 mm. The above process is the first step. Samples having the compositions listed for Nos. 2 to 10 in Table 1 were also prepared in the same manner as above. Samples in Nos. 1 to 10 were irradiated with a laser beam from laser generator 1 in Fig. 1 the second step . The arrangement of the laser generator will be briefly described below. Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 2 denotes a CO₂ laser oscillator a maximum output of 10 kW . Laser beam 3 from oscillator 2 is guided to vacuum chamber 6 through Cu reflecting mirror 4 and ZnSe lens 5. Supply drum 8 for supplying sample 7 also hereinafter referrred to as a starting body and take up drum 9 for taking up samnle 7 are arranged in chamber 6. Sample 7 supplied from drum 8 is irradiated with beam 3 and is then taken up by drum 9. Chamber 6 can be selectively connected to vacuum rump 10 or Ar gas tank 11. Laser beam radiation on the sample 7 was performed in the following manner. Sample 7 was set in drums 8 and 9, chamber 6 was evacuated to a vacuum of 1 Nm 2 10 5 Torr , and Ar gas was supplied to chamber 6 to keep it at atmospheric pressure. Sample 7 was irradiated with beam 3 with beam spot diameter of 1 mm , having the power indicated in Table 1, while sample 7 was taken up by drum 9 at a rate of 10 m min. After laser radiation, i.e., after radiation of the laser beam having a power density of 3.1 10⁵ W cm² i.e., a power of 2.5 kW , compound superconductor 12 having a width of 0.5 mm and a depth of about 0.1 mm was formed on the upper surface of each sample 7, as shown in Fig. 2. The surface of layer 12 was like that of a welded surface. Critical temperatures Tc and critical currents Ic at 17 T of the respective samples, each with the compound superconductor layer, were measured and the results are shown in column The superconducting characteristics of each sample along its longitudinal direction were examined. The same characteristics as in column Part of each sample was annealed at a temperature of 700 C for 100 hours after it was irradiated with the laser beam. The results are shown in column Part of each sample was annealed at a temperature of 1,000 C for 30 minutes prior to radiation of the laser beam. Tc and Ic of the irradiated portion of each sample were measured and were found to be increased, as shown in column In addition, part of each sample in column Following the procedures in the first step in Example 1, Nb, V, and Mo tubes were used for Nb base A 15 type compound, for V base A 15 type compound and for Mo base Chevrel type compound, respectively. The mixtures were filled in the tubes, as in Example 1. The open ends of the tubes were sealed, and the tubes were drawn and rolled to obtain tapes. The tapes were irradiated with the laser beam without removing the outer tubes. The characteristics of the samples were examined to obtain the same results as in column 11 samples of sample No. 7 Nb 17.5 at Aℓ 7.5 at Ge and 11 samples of No. 8 V 25 at Si in column 15 samples of sample No. 5 Nb 25 at Ge in column 11 samples of the same composition as that Nb 25 at Ge in Example 4 were prepared and annealed at a temperature of 1,000 C for 30 minutes. The annealed samples were irradiated with a laser beam having a power of 3 kW. The irradiated samples were then annealed again at different temperatures in the range of 100 to 1,800 C for 100 hours. Critical currents Ic of the 11 resultant superconductors at 17 T were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Curve D shows the results of the superconductor of the same composition as described above, but without the above postheat treatment after the laser radiation. As is apparent from Fig. 5, it is found that an effective heating temperature range is 300 to 1,500 C. 11 samples of the same material as that Nb 25 at Aℓ of sample No. 1 in column In the first embodiment described above, the compositions in column A second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. In this embodiment, a powder molded or sintered body which contains at least one of the components constituting a superconductor to be obtained is prepared in the first step. The molded or sintered body is dipped in a melt containing the remaining components constituting the superconductor to be obtained, and the molded or sintered body is impregnated with the melt. When the melt is solidified, a starting body having the composition of the compound superconductor to be obtained is prepared. The second embodiment will be described in more detail. Using a powder containing niobium as a major constituent or a plurality of wires containing niobium as a major constituent, a sintered body having a predetermined shape is prepared. Alternatively, the powder is molded under pressure to prepare a molded body. Niobium as a major constituent means pure niobium and the material which contains at least one of aluminum, germanium and gallium. It should be noted that the sintered or molded body must have a higher melting point than that of the melt. The sintered or molded body is dipped in a melt containing at least one of aluminum, germanium, and gallium to prepare a starting body. In this case, the ratio of the melt in the starting body is preferably 5 to 50 by volume. When the content of the solution is excessively small, laser radiation on the starting body in the second step does not cause formation of an A 15 type compound superconductor. However, when the content of the solution is excessively large, compounds other than the A 15 type compound are formed to greatly degrade the superconducting characteristics. In order to control the content of the melt in the starting body, the sintering or compressing conditions of the sintered or molded body are changed to obtain a desired porosity. The sintered or molded body is inserted in a niobium tube before or after it is dipped in the melt, so as to achieve better workability in the subsequent process. A sintered or molded body is prepared using at least one powder selected from the group consisting of M M is one metal element selected from lead, tin, copper, and silver , M sulfide, sulfur, molybdenum, and molybdenum sulfide. The sintered or molded body is dipped in a solution containing at least one element selected from the above group, and having a melting point lower than that of the sintered or molded body. The solution is permeated in the pores of the sintered or molded body and is solidified to prepare the starting body. More specifically, M powder, M sulfide powder or a mixture thereof is mixed with Mo powder, Mo sulfide powder, or a mixture thereof to prepare the sintered or molded body. The body is dipped in a sulfur solution to prepare a starting body. Alternatively, a sintered or molded molybdenum sulfide powder body is impregnated with a solution of metal M, which is then solidified to prepare a starting body. Otherwise, one powder selected from metal M sulfide powder, molybdenum powder, and a mixture thereof is added to molybdenum sulfide powder to prepare a sintered or molded body. The body is impregnated with a solution of metal M, which is then solidified to prepare a starting body. The sintered or molded body is preferably inserted in a molybdenum tube before or after it has been impregnated with the solution, so as to achieve better workability in the subsequent process. The starting body prepared in the first step is irradiated with a laser beam in a vacuum or in Ar gas. A power density of the laser beam is set to be 10⁴ W cm² or more on the irradiated portion. When the laser power is less than 10⁴ W cm², the sample is neither heated sufficiently nor do the constituting elements react with each other. Therefore, the compound superconductor cannot be formed. In the second step, when the sample is heat treated before and after the laser beam radiation, good results can be obtained. Heat treatment helps improve the superconducting characteristics. Preheat treatment prior to laser beam radiation causes preliminary reaction between the constituting elements, to assist formation of a superconductor upon irradiation of the laser beam. In this case, a heat treatment temperature range must be set to be 400 to 2,000 C, and preferably 800 to 1,500 C. If the heat treatment temperature is less than 400 C, the constituting elements do not substantially react each other. However, if the heat treatment temperature exceeds 2,000 C, compounds other than the superconductor are undesirably formed. Postheating after laser beam irradiation improves crystallinity of the compound formed by laser radiation, thereby improving the superconducting characteristics. In this case, the heat treatment temperature must fall within the range of 300 to 1,500 C, and preferably 500 to 1,000 C. If the heat treatment temperature is less than 300 C, the elements do not substantially diffuse, therefore failing to improve the crystallinity. However, if the heat treatment temperature exceeds 1,500 C, the crystal grain size is excessively increased, adversely degrading the superconducting characteristics. According to the method of this embodiment, an A 15, Chevrel, or B 1 type compound superconductor having good superconducting characteristics can be easily prepared by rapid heating and cooling with radiation of the laser beam. In particular, according to this method, the solution is permeated in the sintered or molded body, and is solidified to prepare a starting body. Therefore, adhesion of the components constituting the starting body can be improved and therefore, the superconducting characteristics of the resulting compound can be improved. In the second step, the starting body prepared in the first step is irradiated with a laser beam. The laser beam is fixed while the sintered or molded body is moved at high speed. Alternatively, the sintered or molded body is fixed while the laser beam is scanned at high speed. A long superconductor can thus be easily prepared. Since a superconductor having a thickness of several 100 µm can be formed upon irradiation of the laser beam, a superconductor having a sufficiently high critical current Ic can be prepared. According to the method of this embodiment, the compound superconductor having a higher critical temperature Tc, higher upper critical magnetic field Bc2, and high critical current density Jc can be obtained, when compared to existing superconductors, such as Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga, and a long sample of compound superconductors can be easily manufactured. Therefore, a superconducting magnet for generating a higher magnetic field can be formed using the compound superconductor of this embodiment. The conventional Nb₃Sn and V₃Ga superconductors prepared by the fabrication require many steps such as drawing, extrusion, and intermediate annealing. In addition, a final diffusion process requires several tens of hours to several hundreds of hours. However, according to the method of this embodiment, a superconductor can be prepared in a short period of time upon radiation of the laser beam, thus greatly reducing the manufacturing cost. Examples of this embodiment will be described below. This example is for manufacture of A 15 Compound Superconductor 200 g of Nb powder having a 99 purity and a particle size of 100 µm were compressed and molded. The molded body was sintered at a temperature of 2,200 C for an hour. The sintered body was then dipped in an aluminum bath of about 800 C, and an aluminum melt infiltrated in the pores of the sintered body and solidified to prepare a starting body. In this case, the ratio of aluminum in the starting body was 20 by volume. The resultant body was inserted in an Nb tube, and was drawn and rolled to obtain a tape having a width of 4 mm and a thickness of 200 µm sample No. 21 . Four other starting bodies sample Nos. 22 to 25 were prepared in the same manner as above, except for changing solution materials column The prepared samples were irradiated with a laser beam to form corresponding compound superconductor layers. Laser generator 1 used in Example 7 is the same as that in Fig. 1. Critical temperatures Tc and critical currents Ic at 17 T of the resultant compound superconductor layers were measured, and the results are shown in column The characteristics of the respective samples along their longitudinal direction 30 cm were confirmed to be the same as those in column Part of each sample was annealed at a temperature of 700 C for 100 hours after it was irradiated with the laser beam. The results are shown in column Part of each sample was annealed at a temperature of 1,000 C for 30 minutes prior to irradiation of the laser beam. Tc and Ic of the irradiated portion of each sample were measured and were found to be increased, as shown in column Moreover, part of each sample was irradiated with a laser beam at a temperature of 700 C for 100 hours, after the results in column 800 Nb wires having a 99 purity and a diameter of 300 µm were bundled and inserted in an Nb tube, and were heated at a temperature of 2,200 C for an hour to sinter the Nb wires. The sintered body was dipped in a bath of Aℓ 10 at Ge at a temperature of 800 C, and pores of the sintered body were impregnated with a melt of Aℓ Ge alloy. The melt was then solidified to prepare a starting body. In this case, the ratio of the Aℓ Ge alloy in the starting material was 20 by volume. The resultant body was drawn and rolled to prepare a tape having a width of 7 mm and a thickness of 0.2 mm. The tape body was irradiated with a laser beam having a power density of 3.1 10⁵ W cm² a power of 2.5 kW and a beam spot diameter of 1 mm . Tc and Ic at 17 T of the resultant sample were measured to be 17.0 K and 22A, respectively. The sample was further heated at a temperature of 700 C for 100 hours. Tc and Ic at 17 T were found to be increased to 19.2 K and 25 A, respectively. Even if the Nb powder in Example 7 was used in place of the Nb wires, good superconducting characteristics upon radiation of the laser beam were obtained. In the step of preparing the sintered body in Example 8, the number of Nb wires was changed to prepare different samples having 2 to 65 by volume of the Aℓ 10 at Ge alloy. The by volume was calculated by observing sample sections with an optical microscope. The samples were irradiated with a laser beam having a power density of 3.1 10⁵ W cm² a power of 2.5 kW and a beam spot diameter of 1 mm . Critical currents Ic of the samples at 17 T were measured to examine influences of a ratio of Nb to Aℓ Ge alloy on Ic at 17 T. As shown in Fig. 7, a high Ic can be obtained when the content of Aℓ Ge alloy is 5 to 50 by volume, indicating that A 15 compound superconductors within this range can have good superconducting characteristics. This example is for manufacture of Chevrel Compound Superconductor 40 g of Pb powder having a 99 purity and a particle size of 100 µm, and 160 g of Mo powder having a 99.9 purity and a particle size of 10 µm were mixed, and the mixture was compressed and molded. The molded body was sintered at a temperature of 300 C for 5 hours. The sintered body was then dipped in a sulfur bath and was impregnated with sulfur. The sulfur melt was solidified and the resultant body was drawn and rolled to obtain a tape having a width of 4 mm and a thickness of 200 µm sample No. 26 . Other tapes, sample Nos. 27 to 30 were prepared in the same manner as sample No. 26, except that materials of the sintered bodies and melts were different column The samples were irradiated with a laser beam, as in Example 7, to form compound superconductor layers. Critical temperatures Tc and critical currents Ic at 17 T of these compound superconductor layers were measured, and the results are shown in column The influences of heat treatment before and after laser irradiation were examined, as in Example 7. Column In any of the above, increases in Tc and Ic were found. It is thus confirmed that heat treatment before and after laser irradiation is effective. 8 samples of sample No. 12 Nb Ga in column 15 samples of sample No. 15 Nb Aℓ Ge alloy in column As is apparent from Fig. 9, it is found that an effective heat treatment temperature range prior to laser radiation is 400 to 2,000 C and preferably 800 to 1,500 C. 12 samples as in Example 12 were prepared and heated at a temperature of 1,000 C for 30 minutes. The samples were irradiated with a laser beam having a power density of 3.1 10⁵ W cm² a power of 2.5 kW and a beam spot diameter of 1 mm on an irradiated portion thereof. The resultant samples were heated again at different temperatures in the range of 100 to 1,800 C for 100 hours. Critical currents Ic of the 12 resultant superconductor films at 17 T were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. The results for a superconductor of the same composition but without heat treatment are represented by curve D. It is found that an effective heat treatment temperature range after laser irradiation is 300 to 1,500 C and preferably 500 to 1,000 C. 11 samples of sample No. 11 Nb Aℓ alloy in column As is apparent from Fig. 11, it is found that an effective heat treatment temperature range after laser irradiation is 300 to 1,500 C and preferably 500 to 1,000 C. A third embodiment of the present invention will be described below. In the first step, a compound powder containing Nb and N is sealed in an Nb tube and treated to prepare a starting body. In the second step, the starting body is irradiated with a laser beam. Upon radiation of the laser beam, the body is instantaneously heated to a high temperature, and is then rapidly cooled to room temperature. A δ phase NbN compound superconductor layer having an NaCℓ type crystal structure having a 1 1 ratio of Nb to N can thus be obtained. The δ phase layer has good superconducting characteristics. The shape of the starting body can be changed by a treatment prior to the irradiation of the laser beam. For this reason, the superconductor layer can be used in a variety of industrial applications. In addition, the sample or the laser beam can be moved at a speed of several meters min during radiation of the laser beam, thereby efficiently preparing the sample at high speed. Moreover, the vacuum chamber need not be used, unlike in sputtering. As a result, good workability can be achieved. Examples of this embodiment will be described below. 200 g of commercially available Nb powder having a 99 purity and a particle size of 100 µm were heated in a conventional heating furnace in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 1,000 C for 24 hours. An Nb₂N β phase was found to have been produced by X ray diffraction. The resultant powder was filled and sealed in an Nb tube having an outer diameter of 20 mm and an inner diameter of 10 mm. The Nb tube with the powder was forged, drawn, and rolled to obtain a composite tape having a width of 5 mm and a thickness of 150 µm. Critical temperature Tc of the tape was measured by a 4 terminal resistance method to be 9.0 to 9.2 K. The Tc was the same as that of an Nb tube. In other words, good superconducting characteristics cannot be obtained by only heating Nb powder in N₂ gas. Composite tape 21 was cut into 12 cm long samples, which were then fixed on Cu sample jig 22 Fig. 12 with holder jig 23. Jig 22 was moved at a speed of 3 m min and the samples were irradiated with laser beam 24. Melt mark 25, rapidly melted and solidified, was left on the irradiated portion. A CO₂ gas laser of a power of 1 kW was used. In this case, a laser beam spot diameter was 1 mm. In order to prevent oxidation upon irradiation, the samples were placed in an Ar inert gas atmosphere. The samples were prepared within 2 seconds, which is much shorter than the time required for conventional sputtering. X ray diffraction patterns of the resultant samples were then measured. An Nb₂N β phase and an NbN δ phase were thus formed. Critical temperatures Tc of these samples were measured by the 4 terminal resistance method to be as high as 12 K to 14 K. A sample prepared by thermal diffusion had no good superconducting characteristics Tc 9 K . However, the samples prepared by this embodiment had good superconducting characteristics, since the NbN δ phase was formed by rapid heating and cooling upon laser irradiation. TaN TaN Critical temepratures Tc and critical currents Ic at 17 T were measured, and the results are shown in Table 4. In all samples, a Tc exceeding 10 K and an Ic as high as 10 A were obtained, in the same manner as for NbN When an Nb based powder using a mixture of NbN
