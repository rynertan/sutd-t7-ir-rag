Fig. 1 is a diagram of control system, showing an embodiment, in which the present invention is applied to a rolling equipment for seamless steel pipes. More specifically, this rolling equipment is a rolling line for seamless steel pipes according to the Mannessuann plug mill system, wherein the material, which has been heated in a heating furnace 11, is pierced and rolled in a piercer 12, rolled for pipeexpanding and elongating the material in an elongater 13, rolled to a length of a pipe having a wall thickness substantially equivalent to the product wall thickness in a plug mill 14, the inner and outer surfaces of the pipe shaped material are polished by two reelers 15 and the wall thickness reduction and pipe expanding to a certain extent are effected, and the material is finished to be a pipe having an outer diameter of a predetermined value in a sizer 16, thus enabling to provide a final product. In addition, the heating furnace 11 is of a rotary furnace hearth type, in which a plurality of materials are rested on furnace hearth integrally moving the materials, and can be successively extracted. In the above rolling equipment, the heating furnace 11 is controlled by a heating furnace control device 21 and the mills 12 through 16 are controlled respective rolling mill control devices 22 through T6, An actual result of extraction of the material obtained in the heating furnace control device 21 and actual results of rolling of the materials obtained in the respective rolling mill control devices 22 through 26 are transmitted to a calculating means 27. As will be described below, the calculating means 27 determines the optimal extraction time in the heating furnace 11 and makes it possible to transmit the extraction time to the heating furnace control device 21. The operation of the calculating means 27 is shown in Fig. 2.More specifically, the calculating means 27 calculates and pressupposes respective rolling cycle times NCT between the starts of rolling in the respective rolling mills 12 through 16 of a subsequent material to be extracted from the heating furnace 11 and the completion of the preparation for rolling of the following material on the basis of a rolling schedule. Here, the rolling cycle time MCT is defined as a period of time between the time of starting the rolling and time of completing the preparation for the rolling as indicated by a rolling starting signal P1 and a following material rolling readiness signalP 2 in Fig. 3.Then, after pierced materials of the same lot in material quality, dimensions and the like as the subsequent material to be extracted have been passed through the mills 12 through 16, respective presuppoosed cycle tiaes MCT are calculated on the basis of actual result cycle times MCT collected in the respective rolling mill control devices 22 through 26. Whereas, before pierced materials of the same lot as the subsequent materials have not yet been passed through the mills 12 through 16, the respective presupposed rolling cycle timesMCT are calculated on the basis of rolling speeds, rolling lengths, required idle times and the like in the respective mills 12 through 18. More specifically, the aforesaid rolling cycle time MCT is the truly required rolling cycle time in the rolling mill under the control. The period of time between the completion of preparation for the following material and the start of rolling is a loss time lying idle for the rolling mill under the control. Therefore, it is desirable that the loss tines be eliminated in all of the rolling mills, however, the loss times in all of the rolling mills cannot be eliminated because the rolling cycle times MCT are different from one rolling mill to another.Then, if the loss time is eliminated in the rolling mill equipment under critical condition having the largest rolling cycle time MCT, then it becomes possible to improve the productivity to the utmost under given conditions. In other words, this means that the subsequent material should be extracted from the heating furnace 11 by the rolling cycle time of one of the mills 12 through 16, which has the largest rolling cycle time ICY. In consequence, the calculating means 27 adds the largest value of the rolling cycle times MCT relating to the aforesaid subsequent material to be extracted, i.e. an assumed extraction cycle time to the latest actual result extraction time of the heating furnace 11 transimitted from the heating furnace control device 21, to thereby assume an extraction time of the subsequent material to be extracted. Here, if the assured extraction cycle time determined from the respective rolling cycle times MCT as described above is too short, then the loss times in the respective mills 12 through 16 are decreased, however, there occur some cases where materials are retarded immediately before the mills 12 through 16, thus leading to deteriorated product quality and considerably worn rolling tools such as reduction rolls due to lowered temperature of the material. Therefore, the calculating means 27 previously determines allowable retard periods of tine for the materials immediately before the rills 12 through 16, confirms that the presupposed retard periods of time of the subsequent materials to be extracted immediately before the mills 12 through 16 are within the range of the aforesaid allowable retard periods of time, and when the presupposed retard periods of time are beyond the range of the allowable retard periods of time, the calculating means 27 performs again the calculation and presupposition of respective rolling cycle times MCT and the provisional calculation of extraction tire. More specifically, the aforesaid allowable retard periods of time will be determined in the following manner. To cite a seamless steel pipe for example, a theoretical radiation calculation formula the relationship of the lowered value of the temperature of a pipe material with the elapsed time on the dimensions outer diameter and wall thickness of the pipe materials in the respective mills 12 through 16 is sought, while, the relationships between the temperature of the pipe material and defects on the inner surface of the pipe material and between the temperature of the pipe material and wear of the rolling tools, etc. are sought on the basis of the actual results, and it is detersined within what retard period of tire at the largest the rolling can be started in order to roll the pipe material within the range of suitable temperature. Furthermore, the calculation of the presupposed retard periods of time immediately before the mills 12 through 16 and the confirmation of that the presupposed retard periods of time are within the range of the allowable retard period of time are carried out in the following manner.Namely, if a presupposed rolling cycle time MCT of a material No.counted from the latest material 1 to be started for rolling in a rolling mill No. x is made to be MCTx i , a target extraction time of the subsequent material n to be extracted from the heating furnace 11 is made to be Tn and an actual result time when the latest material to be started for rolling in the rolling mill No. x is extracted from the heating furnace 11 is made to be T1 , then a presupposed retard period of time h of the subsequent material to be extracted immediately before the rolling mill No. x is sought through the following equation. n hx z MCTx i Tn T, 1 i 1 Subsequently, an allowable retard period of time in the rolling mill No. x is made to be and a difference fx x between r x and the presupposed retard period of time hx is sought through the following equation. n z MCTx i Tn Tl fx ... 2 ii Further, calculation is made through the following equation for the rolling mills from No. 1 to the final one No. i . And, if F 0, then it is judged that extraction can be made, and, if F 0, then it is judged that extraction cannot be made F MAX fi ... fx ... fm ... 3 As described above, when the subsequent materials to be extracted are conveyed to the mills 12 through 18, the calculating means 27 calculates and presupposes the periods of time for awaiting the rolling immediately before the mills 12 through 16, i.e. retard periods of time. When the retard periods of time are within the range of allowable values for all of the rolling mills, it is judged that extraction can be made, and when the retard period of time exceeds the allowable retard period of time in any one of the rolling pills, it is judged that extraction cannot be made. However, when the subsequent material is extracted from the heating furnace 11 as described above, if the extraction cycle time is short, then such a case occurs in the heating furnace 11 that the material is not satisfactorily and uniformly heated, thus causing undesirable influence to the product quality. Then, the calculating means 27 calculates a heating critical cycle time HCT sufficient for applying heat of a predetermined value to the respective materials including the subsequent material to be extracted and the latest material to be extracted, which are present in the heating furnace 11, on the basis of the rolling schedule. More specifically, the calculating means 27 calculates the heating critical cycle time sufficient for applying heat of the predetermined value to the respective materials being present in the heating furnace 11 through the following equation. HCT MAX CT1 CTm CTn ... 4 The CTm above is sought through the equation 5 which will be shown below. CTm f Da, L ... 5 where CTm is a furnace neck extraction cycle tire to a material of lotNo. m in looking from the side of extraction, Dx a diameter of the material of lot No. m, and Lm a length of the material of lot No. m. Further, when the subsequent material is extracted at the assumed extraction time, the calculating means 27 judges whether or not the aforesaid heating critical cycle time HCT is secured between the subsequent material to be extracted and its preceding material to be extracted When it is judged that the heating critical cycle time H5T can be secured, the calculating means 27 transmits the aforesaid assumed extraction time to the heating furnace control device 21 as the optimal extraction time for the subsequent material to be extracted.When it is judged that the aforesaid heating critical cycle time HCT is not secured, the calculating means 27 repeats the calculation and presupposition of the respective rolling cycle tines nCT, assumption of the extraction time, confirmation of that the presupposed retard period of time is within the allowable retard period of time and confirmation of that the heating critical cycle time can be secured. In addition, the rolling start signal necessary for determining the rolling cycle times MCT in the mills 12 through 18 and the subsequent material rolling readiness signal are determined as shown inTable 1. Figs. 4A and 4B are histograms showing the relationship between the loss time and the number of materials N in the equipment under critical condition in the operating system according to the prior art and in the operating system according to the present invention, respectively, when the materials each having a diameter of 230 mm and a length of 1,535 mm are loaded into the heating furnace in two rows and rolled into steel pipes each having an outer diameter of 273.8 mm, a wall thickness of 6.35 mm and a length of 11,705 mm.

Further, the present invention is applicable to the rolling equipment for rolling bar steel, wire steel and the like. Furthermore, the present invention is applicable irrespective of the number of rolling mills, and on the contrary, the larger the number of rolling mills is, the greater the effects can be attained.
